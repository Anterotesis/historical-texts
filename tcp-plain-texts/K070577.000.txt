following letters were written merely as a private tribute of friendship and without the least view of their passing from the hands of the gentleman to whom they are addressed into any other but those of the Author's most intimate connections To the latter they were accordingly communicated and it was solely in compliance with their unanimous though perhaps too partial opinion that he consented to commit them to the press For that purpose a revisal of them became necessary in the course of which he availed himself of every means in his power to render them less unworthy of public inspection and he feels a just pride in acknowledging that he has received much additional information from several of his literary acquaintance in Swisserland that by Captain Floyd's obliging communication of the very accurate journal he kept during their joint tour he has been enabled to insert several material circumstances which had either slipped his memory or escaped his observation and that it is owing to the judicious animadversions of some other of his ingenious friends that these sheets do not appear with all their original imperfections  THE CONTENTS  LETTER I FROM Strasbourg through part of the

of its different governments and for the singular beauties conferred upon it by nature As both these circumstances cannot fail of being highly interesting to any one who has the least degree of curiosity I propose to myself great satisfaction in this tour not without some regret however that  our time for this expedition is extremely limited and that we shall not be able to visit as much as I could wish of so delightful a country But as it is always one's interest not so much to regret what we cannot have as to make the most of what is in our power I shall endeavour to gain all the information which the shortness of the time will admit and if it will not be trespassing upon your patience I propose to trouble you with some account of my tour writing however only when it may be convenient to me and without promising that you will find me a very punctual correspondent I am persuaded that I shall travel with much greater profit to myself when I am thus to inform you of all that I have seen as the reflection that my observations are to be communicated to you will be one means of rendering me more attentive and accurate in forming them  We quitted Strasbourg yesterday and crossed the Rhine to Kehl formerly an  important fortress belonging to Strasbourg when an imperial city It was also strongly fortified by the French who took possession of it in but it was ceded to the Empire at the peace of Ryswic the Emperor consigned it over to the house of Baden reserving however to himself the right of having a garrison therein Since that period it has been twice besieged by the French and as during the last siege in the works were considerably damaged the imperial garrison has been withdrawn at present there are only the ruins of the ancient fortifications and by way of garrison a few invalids belonging to the Margrave of Baden From thence we proceeded to Offenbourg a small imperial town and soon after entered the beautiful valley of Kinsing passed through Gengenbach another small imperial town finely situated and went up the valley along the course of the river Kinsing rising  gradually for several leagues together until we found ourselves in the midst of the Black Forest As we ascended the country became more wild and romantic and the river more rapid on each hand mountains whose sides were finely cultivated and whose tops were richly covered with a continual forest Several small streams of the clearest water rolled down the sides of the mountains forming numberless little cascades in their passage and uniting fell into the Kinsing The views were so exceedingly diversified the villages so delightfully situated and the cottages so exceedingly picturesque that we almost imagined we had anticipated the romantic beauties of Swisserland  Doneschingen is the principal residence of the prince of Furstenberg in the courtyard of his palace the Danube takes its rise I am this moment returned from visiting the spot  the description of which may be comprised in a few words Some small springs rising from the ground form a bason of clear water of about thirty foot square from this pool issues the Danube being at first nothing more than a little brook And though the two small rivers of Bribach and Brege uniting below the town are far more considerable than this stream which flows into them soon after their junction yet it is the latter that alone has the honour of being called the source of the Danube and gives name to the other two After we had gone through the ceremony of striding across the stream in order to say that we had  stepped  over the Danube we soon satisfied our curiosity the object itself being in no respect extraordinary but deriving its principal recommendation from being one of the sources of so considerable a river Indeed it was this circumstance alone that induced  us to enter Swisserland by the way of Suabia  I am dear Sir very affectionately yours WILLIAM COXE  LETTER II  Schaffhausen  July  I HAVE great pleasure in breathing the air of liberty every person here has apparently the mien of content and satisfaction The cleanliness of the houses and of the people is peculiarly striking and I can trace in all their manners behaviour and dress some strong outlines which distinguish this happy people from the neighbouring nations Perhaps it may be prejudice and unreasonable partiality but I am the more pleased because their first appearance very much reminds me of my  own countrymen and I could almost think for a moment that I am in England  Schaffhausen is a neat and tolerably wellbuilt town situated upon the northern shore of the Rhine It is the capital of the canton of the same name and owes its origin to the interruption of the navigation of that river by the cataract at Lauffen huts were at first constructed here for the convenience of unloading the merchandize from the boats and these huts by degrees encreased to a large town Schaffhausen was formerly an imperial city and was governed by an aristocracy it preserved its liberties which were attacked by the Dukes of Austria by entering into an alliance with several other imperial towns and with the Swiss cantons In it was admitted a member of the Helvetic confederacy being the twelfth canton in rank Of all the cantons it is the least in size being only five leagues in  length and three in breadth its population is supposed to amount to twentyfive thousand souls of which the capital contains about six thousand  The whole number of citizens or burgesses in whom the supreme power ultimately resides is I am informed about sixteen hundred They are divided into twelve tribes and from these are elected eightyfive members who form the sovereign council consisting of a great and little council To these two councils combined the administration of affairs is committed the senate or little council of twentyfive being entrusted with the executive power and the great council comprising the senate finally deciding all appeals and regulating the more important concerns of government  The revenues of the state arise partly from the tythes and other articles of the like nature but principally from the duties laid upon the merchandise which  passes from Germany and I am informed that these customs are nearly sufficient to defray all the public expences These indeed are not very considerable as will appear from the salary of the burgomaster or chief of the republic which barely amounts to £  per ann  The reformation was introduced here in the clergy are paid by the state but their income is literally not sufficient for their maintenance the best living being only about £ and the worst £  per ann  The professors of literature also who are taken from the clergy are paid likewise by government and a public school is supported at the expence of the same Sumptuary laws are in force here as well as in most parts of Swisserland and no dancing is allowed except upon particular occasions silk lace and several other articles of luxury are prohibited even the ladies headdresses are regulated How would such Gothic ordinances  be received in England they would serve at least to lower the price of feathers But what is of still greater importance all games of hazard are strictly prohibited and in other games the party who loses above six florins about nine shillings of our money incurs a considerable fine An excellent regulation and I was informed that these laws are not like ours of the same kind mere cyphers but are well observed The principal article of exportation is wine of which they make a large quantity the country abounding in vineyards and as the canton furnishes but little corn they procure it from Suabia in exchange for their wine In the town there are some but not very considerable manufactures of linen cotton and silk their commerce however is very flourishing  It will perhaps give you some idea of the security of the Swiss cantons when I tell you that Schaffhausen although a  frontier town has no garrison and that the fortifications are but slight The citizens mount guard by turns and the people of the canton being divided into regular companies of militia which are exercised yearly are always ready and prepared to take up arms in defence of their country This canton has some troops in the services of France Sardinia and Holland the only foreign services into which the subjects of the Protestant cantons enlist  Before I take my leave of this city I must not omit mentioning the famous bridge over the Rhine justly admired for the beauty and singularity of its architecture The river is extremely rapid and had already destroyed several bridges of stone built upon arches of the strongest construction when a carpenter of Appenzel undertook to throw a wooden one of a single arch across the river which is near three hundred feet wide The magistrates however  insisted that it should consist of two arches and that he should make use for that purpose of the middle pier of the old bridge which remained entire Accordingly the architect was obliged to obey but he has contrived it in such a manner that the bridge is not at all supported by the middle pier and it would certainly have been equally safe and considerably more beautiful had it consisted solely of one arch But how shall I attempt to give you an idea of it I who am totally unskilled in architecture and who have not the least knowledge of drawing Take however the following description and excuse its inaccuracy  It is a wooden bridge of which the sides and top are covered and the road over it is almost perfectly level it is what the Germans call a haengewerk or hanging bridge the road not being carried as usual over the top of the arch but if I may use the expression is let down into the middle of it and  there suspended The middle pier is not absolutely in a right line with the side ones that rest upon the shore as it forms with them a very obtuse angle pointing down the stream being eight foot out of the linear direction the distance of this middle pier from the shore that lies towards the town is one hundred and seventyone feet and from the other side one hundred and ninetythree in all three hundred and sixtyfour feet making in appearance two arches of a surprizing width and forming the most beautiful perspective imaginable when viewed at some distance A man of the slightest weight walking upon it feels it tremble under him and yet waggons heavily laden pass over it without danger and although in the latter instance the bridge seems almost to crack with the pressure it does not appear to have ever suffered the least damage It has been compared and very justly to a tight rope which  trembles when it is struck but still preferves its firm and equal tension I went under this bridge close to the middle pier in order to examine its mechanism and though not the least of a mechanic I could not help being struck with the elegant simplicity of the architecture I was not capable of determining whether it rests upon the middle pier but most judges agree that it does not  When one observes the greatness of the plan and the boldness of the construction one is astonished that the architect was a common carpenter without the least proficiency in learning totally ignorant of mathematics and not at all versed in the theory of mechanics The name of this extraordinary man was Ulric Grubenman an obscure drunken fellow of Tuffen a small village in the canton of Appenzel Possessed of uncommon natural abilities and a surprising turn for the practical  part of mechanics he raised himself to great eminence in his profession and may justly be considered as one of the most ingenious architects of the present century This bridge was finished in less than three years and cost ninety thousand florins  About £ sterling Mr Andreae in his Letters upon Swisserland has given two engravings of this bridge to which he has added a very accurate description of its mechanical construction communicated to him by Mr Jetzler of Schaffhausen In this description he considers it as consisting of two arches and represents the bridge as resting upon the middle pier but I have been assured by several persons of very respectable authority who saw it soon after it was built that the bridge when it was first constructed did not even touch the pier in question and since that time that there has been a wedge driven in by order of the magistrates As a proof if indeed any such proof be wanted that the architect could have succeeded in constructing the bridge without the aid of the middle pier his brother John Grubenman no less eminent than the other built about the same time and in the same stile of architecture a bridge over the Rhine at Reichenau in the Grisons which is two hundred and forty feet long and is but of one arch And what would have been still more extraordinary Ulric Grubenman had agreed to throw a bridge of a single arch and of the same construction over the river Derry in Ireland The river is six hundred feet wide which by means of abutments was to have been reduced to four hundred it was to have cost £ but the plan was not carried into execution for want of proper encouragement  Vid  Briefe aus der Schweiz noch Hannover geschnében  printed at Zuric    This morning we set out on horseback in order to see the fall of the Rhine at Lauffen about a league from this place Our road lay over the hills which form the banks of the Rhine from whence we had some fine views of the town and castle of Schaffhausen the environs are picturesque and agreeable the river beautifully winding through the vale Upon our arrival at Lauffen a small village in the canton of Zuric we dismounted and advancing to the edge of the  precipice which overhangs the Rhine we looked down perpendicularly upon the cataract and saw the river tumbling over the sides of the rock with amazing violence and precipitation From hence we descended till we were somewhat below the upper bed of the river and stood close to the fall so that I could almost have touched it with my hand A scaffolding is erected in the very spray of this tremendous cataract and upon the most sublime point of viewthe sea of foam tumbling downthe continual cloud of spray scattered around at a great distance and to a considerable heightin short the magnificence of the whole scenery far surpassed my most sanguine expectations and exceeds all description Within about an hundred feet as it appeared to be of the scaffolding there are two rocks in the middle of the fall that prevent one from seeing its whole breadth from this point the nearest of these was perforated by the  continual action of the river and the water forced itself through in an oblique direction with inexpressible fury and an hollow sound After having continued some time contemplating in silent admiration the awful sublimity of this wonderful landscape we descended and below the fall we crossed the river which was exceedingly agitated  Hitherto I had only viewed the cataract sideways but here it opened by degrees and displayed another picture which I enjoyed at my leisure as I sat myself down upon the opposite bank The most striking objects were as follow on the side we came from a castle erected upon the very edge of the precipice and overhanging the river near it a church and some cottages on the side where I was sitting a clump of cottages close to the fall in the back ground rising hills planted with vines or tufted with hanging woods a beautiful little hamlet upon the summit  skirted with trees the great body of water that seemed as it were to rush out from the bottom of these hills the two rocks above mentioned boldly advancing their heads in the midst of the fall and in the very point of its steepest descent their tops covered with shrubs and dividing the cataract into three principal branches The colour of the Rhine is extremely beautiful being of a clear seagreen and I could not but remark the fine effect of the tints of green when blended with the white foam in its descent There is a pleasing view from an iron foundery close to the river which is dammed up in order to prevent its carrying away the works and neighbouring cottages by means of this dam a small portion of the river in its fall enters a trough turns a mill and forms a beautiful little silver current gliding down the bare rock and detached from the main cataract Below the fall the river widens considerably  into a more ample bason at the fall the breadth as well as I could judge by my eye seemed to be about two hundred and fifty feet As to its perpendicular heighth travellers differ those who are given to exaggeration reckon it an hundred feet high but I should imagine about fifty feet will be nearer the truth I stood for some time upon the brink of the cataract beheld in admiration and listened in silence then crossed the river remounted my horse and returned to Schaffhausen  Some writers have asserted that the river precipitates itself in one sheet of water and as I before observed from a perpendicular heighth of an hundred feet In former ages this account was probably agreeable to fact as it is imagined that the space between the two banks was once a level rock and considerably higher that the river has insensibly worn away and undermined those parts on which it broke along  with the utmost violence for within the memory of several of the inhabitants of this town a large rock has given way that has greatly altered the view Indeed I am convinced that the perpendicular heighth of the fall becomes less and less every year by the continual friction of so large and rapid a body of water and have no doubt but that the two rocks which now rise in the midst of the river will in time be undermined and carried away The river for some way before the fall even near the bridge dashes upon a rocky bottom and renders the navigation impossible for any kind of vessel A few weeks ago a countryman of ours tried an experiment with a small boat which he contrived to have gently pushed to the edge of the cataract it shot down entire to the bottom of the fall was out of sight for a few moments and then rose up again dashed into a thousand splinters  I am c  LETTER III  Constance  July  YESTERDAY morning we quitted Schaffhausen and crossed the Rhine at Diessenhoffen a small town in Thurgovy a country dependent upon the eight antient cantons from thence to Stein the road lay by the side of that river Stein is an independent town under the protection of Zuric but governed by its own laws and magistrates At this place we took a boat to carry us to Constance A little above the town of Stein the river widens considerably and forms the inferior lake of Constance or the Zeller See which is divided into two branches from Stein to Constance is about sixteen miles and from the latter to Zell its greatest breadth about ten  A fine breeze soon carried us to the island of Reichenau which is under  the sovereignty of the thirteen cantons it is about three miles long and one broad contains about sixteen hundred inhabitants all Catholics three parishes one village and a rich abbey of Benedictines of which the bishop of Constance is abbot The superior was exceedingly civil and shewed us all the relics and curiosities of the convent among the latter was a rotten tooth of Charles Le Gros That monarch who was emperor and king of France and who possessed dominions as extensive as those of Charlemain lived to want the common necessaries of life and to depend for his subsistence upon the charity of an archbishop of Mentz He was publicly deposed in at a meeting of the principal French German and Italian barons whom he himself had summoned after having languished a year in extreme want and misery he died and was buried in this convent The next remarkable  curiosity was an emerald as it is called of an extraordinary size which according to the annals of the convent was a present from Charlemain Take its dimensions and then judge whether it can be an emerald it has four unequal sides the longest of which is near two feet and the broadest about nine inches it is one inch thick and weighs about twentynine pounds The superior valued it at fifty thousand florins but if it be as I conjecture nothing more than a transparent green fluorspathus its value will be reduced to a few florins Upon our return to the inn where we dined we found a present from the superior which we valued more than all the relics and curiosities of his convent two bottles of excellent wine the growth of the island which indeed is almost one continued vineyard  In the evening we arrived at Constance its situation upon the Rhine  between the two lakes is most delightful I was much struck with the solitary appearance of a town once so flourishing in commerce and formerly so celebrated in the annals of history There was a dead stillness throughout grass growing in the principal streets in a word it wears the melancholy aspect of being almost totally deserted and upon enquiry I found there were scarcely three thousand inhabitatns This city has met with a sad reverse of fortune it was formerly in alliance with Strasbourg Zuric Basil c and supported by the assistance of Zuric and Berne had driven out the bishop and embraced the reformation But the Protestant cantons being worsted in and the league of Smalcade of which Constance was a member being defeated by Charles V the town was obliged to submit to the emperor and to readmit the Catholic religion From this period it lost its independence  and being neglected by the house of Austria it fell by degrees into its present almost annihilated state and exhibits to some of the neighbouring Swiss cantons an instructive contrast which cannot but the more sensibly endear to them their own invaluable happiness in the commerce and liberties they enjoy  We paid a visit to the chamber where the council of Constance was held in and had the honour of sitting in the two chairs in which sat pope John XXIII  He was deposed in this council  and the emperor Sigismond if any honour can be derived from a turbulent ecclesiastic and a perjured sovereign It was by a sentence of this council that the celebrated reformer John Huss having embraced the doctrines of our Wickliffe and trusting to the safeguard of the emperor who violated his word was burnt as an heretic They shew the house in which he was seized and upon which his head carved  in stone but now almost defaced is fixed with an inscription under it in German Jerome of Prague his disciple had the weakness to recant before the same council but this weakness was amply compensated by the greatness of soul with which he again retracted this recantation and by the calm and intrepid magnanimity which he shewed in his last moments at the stake From the top of the cathedral we had a superb view of the town which is now scarce a third of its antient extent of the two lakes with the rugged Alps of Tyrol and Appenzel their tops covered with perpetual snow  I am just returned from a pleasant expedition to the small island of Meinau in a bay of the superior lake this island about a mile in circumference belongs to the knights of the Teutonic order The bailiff shewed us the house of the commander which  is prettily situated and has a fine prospect of the lake but contains nothing remarkable The garden might have been well laid out by a judicious hand at a very small expence but the man who planned it took it into his head to hide the view of the lake which after much cost he has at length unhappily effected by means of high and cut hedges the honest gardener did not forget to expatiate on the merit of this  curious  contrivance The cellars of this castle are well stocked with wine an article from whence the chief revenue of the commandery arises Our good friend the bailiff was very free in offering it to us and we not to appear insensible of his civility were constrained to taste of several different sorts which he presented one after the other always praising the last as the oldest and the most exquisite The wine was indeed excellent the glasses large and a most formidable row of enormous casks  still remained untasted so that after having duly extolled several specimens we found it expedient to decline the farther solicitations of our generous host for had we gone through the whole ceremony we should most probably have taken up our abode in the castle for this night  July  We set sail about two hours ago from Constance This superior lake or as it is sometimes called the Boden See is about fifteen leagues in length and six in its greatest breadth it is one of the great boundaries that separate Swisserland from Germany The borders on each side consist of gently rising hills on the left hand Suabia and on the right Thurgovy with a variety of towns villages and monasteries scattered about the form of the lake inclines to an oval and the water is of a greenish hue I am now writing aboard the vessel and have been for some time in vain attempting to  distinguish what some travellers have affirmed to be discernable the waters of the Rhine from those of the lake though indeed I was before almost convinced of the impossibility For the river in its course from the superior lake being exactly of the same beautiful greenish colour as the inferior lake into which it flows it is evident that the one can never be distinguished from the other Probably upon its first entrance into the superior lake it is troubled and consequently for some way its current may easily be traced but it purifies by degrees and becomes an indistinct part of the great body of water  This lake is considerably deeper in summer than in winter owing to the first meltings of the snow from the neighbouring mountains it abounds in fish of all sorts and contains two species which are peculiar to itself and are taken only three months in the year  Yesterday evening in our expedition to Meinau there was scarce a breeze stirring and the lake was as smooth as chrystal a brisk gale has now raised a fine curl upon the surface and the surrounding landscape forms an assemblage of the most beautiful objects imaginable In short the several views which present themselves are so truly enchanting that I regret every moment that my eyes are called off from the delightful scene around me You will not wonder therefore if I am tempted to bid you adieu somewhat abruptly  Yours c  LETTER IV  July  I WRITE to you from the midst of the Alps under the shade of a grove of beeches while a clear stream  of water flowing at my feet forms a natural cascade down the rock I have just made a hearty meal upon some bread and cheese which I found to be a most delicious repast after having well earned it by walking near six miles over the mountains of Appenzel  We this day quitted St Gallen where being asked a most extravagant price for the hire of six horses by those who thought we must necessarily take them upon their own terms we determined not to submit to the imposition but to walk to Appenzel and send our baggage by the horseroad but not to ascribe the whole merit of this heroic resolution altogether to oeconomy I must tell you at the same time that we were informed beforehand that the footway was by much the most agreeable Nor do I in the least repend of having made the experiment for the beauty and singularity of the road through which we passed has more  than compensated for any fatigue of the journey The country is singularly wild and romantic consisting of a continued series of vallies with ranges of mountains whose tops are crowned with the most luxuriant pastures I ever beheld I could not have conceived it possible without having been an eyewitness that any district within the same compass could have exhibited so numerous a population the hills and vales being strewed thick with hamlets scattered at a small distance from each other and they are exactly placed too in the very spots which a man of taste would have fixed upon The picturesque mountains the forests the currents which we passed over bridges resembling those I have seen in some of the best landscapes added to the beauty of the scenes and diversified with the most pleasing objects every step we took After having reposed for a short time in this delightful spot I  cannot employ myself more to my satisfaction than by giving you a continuation of my journal  I took my leave of you in my last upon the lake of Constance we landed at Roshach a small town in the dominions of the abbot of St Gallen delightfully situated in the midst of a bay at the edge of the lake and at the bottom of a rising hill richly covered with wood and pasturages From Roshach we went to St Gallen whose whole territory does not exceed a league and an half in circumference the town contains seven thousand inhabitants its environs two Every thing here was alive all wore the appearance of industry and activity exhibiting a striking opposition to Constance which we had just quitted  The abbot and town of St Gallen are both allies of the Swiss cantons and each have the peculiar privilege of sending deputies to the general diet I call  it  peculiar  because none of the other allies except Bienne and Mulhausen enjoy the same The abbot of St Gallen is titular prince of the Empire and is chosen by seventytwo Dominican monks belonging to the abbey out of their number He formerly possessed the sovereignty of the town but the inhabitants shook off his authority and became independent and although since that period various disputes have arisen between the two rival parties they have been at different times compromised by the interposition of the Swiss cantons The town is entirely Protestant and its government aristodemocratical the subjects of the abbot whose territory is very extensive and whose power absolute are mostly Catholics It is remarkable that the abby in which the prince resides is situated close to the town and in the midst of its territory as that of the latter is also entirely surrounded by the possessions of the former  The town owes its flourishing state to the uncommon industry of the inhabitants and to a very extensive commerce arising chiefly from its manufactures of linen muslin and embroidery In a place so entirely commercial I was astonished to find the arts and sciences cultivated and literature in the highest esteem In the library there are thirteen volumes in folio containing manuscript letters to and from several of the first German and Swiss reformers Luther ends a letter to Melancthon as follows  Pestis eram vivus moriens ero mors tua Papa  These letters would probably throw a new light on the history of the reformation  The library belonging to the abbey is very numerous and well arranged and among a number of monkish manuscripts contains several classic ones which engaged my chief  attention In this library Petronius Arbiter Silvius Italicus and Valerius Flaccus were found in and copies dispersed it was formerly very rich in curious manuscripts but several were borrowed during the council of Constance by the cardinals and bishops who never returned them  The transition from the abbot of St Gallen to the canton of Appenzel will not appear abrupt as the latter once belonged to the former the inhabitants however being loaded with exorbitant and oppressive taxes revolted in and maintained their independence with the desperate courage of a spirited people who fight for their liberties In they entered into a perpetual alliance with some of the neighbouring Swiss republics and in were admitted into the Helvetic confederacy they hold the last rank among the thirteen cantons  Before the reformation the whole canton was under one government but  since that period part of the inhabitants having embraced the Protestant religion and the other part continuing Catholics violent disputes were kindled between them which after much contest were at length compromised By an agreement in the canton was divided into two portions Rhodes Exterior and Rhodes Interior it was stipulated that the former should be appropriated to the residence of the Protestants and the latter to that of the Catholics Accordingly the two parties finally separated and formed two republics their government police finances c being totally independent of each other Each district sends a deputy to the general diet the whole canton however has but one vote and loses its suffrage if the two parties are not unanimous In both divisions the sovereign power is vested in the people at large every male who is past sixteen having a vote in their general assembly held yearly for the creation of their  magistrates and the purposes of legislation and each voter is obliged to appear armed on that particular occasion The Landamman is the first magistrate in each district there are two who administer the office alternately and are confirmed yearly They have each a permanent council in which all jurisdiction in civil and criminal causes is lodged together with the care of the police the management of the finances and the general administration of affairs The Landamman regent presides and the other during the year in which he is out of office is banneret or chief of the militia  The Rhodes Exterior is much larger and more peopled in proportion than the Interior and the Protestants are in general more commercial and industrious than the CatholicsThe former are supposed to amount to thirtyseven thousand the latter to twelve thousand a considerable number in a small canton  of about sixty square leagues entirely mountainous and of which a great part consists of barren and inaccessible rocks But the industry of the inhabitants amply compensates for any disadvantages of soil for the people are frugal and laborious their property is assured and they are exempted from all burdensome and arbitrary taxes These circumstances joined to their right of partaking of the legislation and of electing their magistrates inspire them with such animated sentiments of their own importance and independence as excite the most active and vigorous industry and those necessaries to which this industry is not sufficient are abundantly supplied by their neighbours in exchange for their manufactures and other articles of their domestic commerce The chief part of the habitable country consists in rich pastures and of course their principal exports are cattle and hides together with cheese and butter their manufactures  are linen and thread of both which they make a considerable quantity and for the support of which the canton furnishes flax in great abundance  There are no inclosed towns in this canton it contains only two or three open burghs as they are called of which Appenzel is the largest in the Catholic and Herisau in the Protestant district together with a few small villages but indeed the whole country except amongst the barren rocks is almost a continued village covered thick as it is with excellent cottages which have the most beautiful effect imaginable Each cottage has its little territory consisting generally of a field or two of fine pasture ground and frequently skirted with trees of the latter there is great plenty the mountains being for the most part beautifully wooded and the canton is supplied with water in such exuberance that we  could hardly walk two hundred paces without seeing a spring issuing from the ground or perhaps a torrent rushing down the sides of a rock  In our way to Appenzel we entered several of their houses which are all built of wood neatness and convenience being the principal object of the owners and such a remarkable cleanliness prevailed throughout as afforded me a most striking proof of the general attention this people pay to that essential article A continued chain of these cultivated mountains richly cloathed with wood and studded all over with hamlets which one would almost imagine had been placed by the genius of taste in the very spots where they would have the most striking effect exhibits a landscape inexpressibly pleasing it seemed as if they belonged to so many independent clans independent but social and uniting for the great purposes of legislation and for the general preservation  of their liberties The Protestant division contains about ten thousand men capable of bearing arms and the Catholic about three thousand  Among the chief part of the inhabitants the original simplicity of the pastoral life is still preserved and I saw several venerable figures with long beards that resembled the old patriarchs I am much mortified that I cannot speak German which is their language as that natural frankness and particular tone of equality which arise from a consciousness of their own independence could not fail of affording me very interesting conversation As to the state of literature my stay here has been so short that I cannot form any accurate idea of it I have only been informed in general that learning has made its way over these mountains and that there are several men of letters in this canton who are  an honour to themselves and an ornament to their country  In our way to this place we passed through Tuffen the birthplace of Ulric Grubenman whom I mentioned in a former letter  See p  he has been dead some years but his abilities and his skill in practical architecture are if I may use the expression hereditary in his family We enquired for one of the same name who was either his brother or his nephew whom we found at the alehouse his usual place of resort when he has no particular employment He is a heavy coarselooking man dressed like a common peasant has a quick and penetrating eye and a surprising readiness of conversation We told him that we were Englishmen who were making the tour of Swisserland and as we wished to view every thing remarkable in the country we could not pass through Tuffen without desiring to see a man who was so much celebrated for  his skill in architecture He struck his breast and replied in German  "Here you see but a boor"  Upon our talking with him about the bridge of Schaffhausen in the building of which he was employed he assured us that it does not rest upon the middle pier but is in effect a single arch Near Appenzel we observed an old man with venerable white hair hanging down over his shoulders who looked like one of our substantial farmers he enquired with a tone of authority but with perfect civility who we were and upon our asking the same question respecting himself of our guide we were informed that he was the  Landamman  or chief of the republic Happy people the nature of whose country and the constitution of whose government both equally oppose the strongest barriers against the baneful introduction of luxury  Yours c  Appenzel  July  LETTER V  Salets  July  WE are this moment arrived at this place where we propose passing the night while supper is preparing I will continue my journal We could procure but three horses at Appenzel and as one of them was appropriated to the baggage I preferred walking accordingly I set out by myself some time before the cavalcade After having walked a league in the canton through the same kind of country mentioned in my last a continued range of mountains enriched with beautiful meadows and dotted thick with cottages I arrived at its boundary when the scene suddenly changed into a wild forest consisting chiefly of pines without the least appearance of any habitation The road is very singular It is in most parts not more than three feet broad and is  either paved with large uneven pieces of rock or formed of thick stakes laid closely together but as the ground is in many parts softer than in others these stakes of course in some places sink deeper and by this means form an almost invariable succession of uneven steps The mountain by which we descended into the plain is very steep which added to the unevenness of the stakes makes the ascent and descent exceedingly difficult for horses Those who are pleased with an uniform view may continue in the plain while others who delight in the grand and the sublime and are struck with the wantonness of wild uncultivated nature will prefer this road to the smoothest turnpike in Great Britain  I walked slowly on without envying my companions on horseback for I could sit down upon an inviting sport climb to the edge of a precipice or trace a torrent by its sound I descended  at length into the Rheinthal or valley of the Rhine the mountains of Tyrol which yielded neither in heighth or in cragginess to those of Appenzel rising before me And here I found a remarkable difference for although the ascending and descending was a work of some labour yet the variety of the scenes had given me spirits and I was not sensible of the least fatigue But in the plain notwithstanding the scenery was still beautiful and picturesque I saw at once the whole way stretching before me and had no room for fresh expectations I was not therefore sorry when I arrived at Oberried after a walk of about twelve miles my coat slung upon my shoulder like a peripatetic by profession Here we were lucky enough to procure a narrow open cart in which the roads being rough and stony you will readily believe we were not much at our ease The evening however being fine and the moon exceedingly bright  our journey was not altogether unpleasant as it led us through a delightful country abounding in vines in fruittrees in flax and excellent pasturages  This Rheinthal is a bailliage belonging to Appenzel and the eight antient cantons which alternately appoint a bailiff The people are industrious and manufacture a considerable quantity of linen cotton muslins plain and embroidered they consist of both religions but the Protestants are the most numerous  Wallenstadt  July  We quitted Salets this morning  in  the same narrow open cart in which we arrived and it would have afforded your curiosity matter of some speculation to observe how we contrived to arrange ourselves our servants a large Newfoundland dog and the baggage in so narrow a compass indeed we were so wedged in together that it was almost impossible  to stir after we had once fixed ourselves in our several places The day was sultry and the sun powerful the road bad and the cart went barely at the rate of three miles an hour but the country still continued so picturesque and mountainous and our attention was so entirely taken up with the perpetual variety of objects it presented to our view as to make us forget the inconveniences of our equipage and the excessive heat of the weather From Trivabach a small village upon the Rhine we walked to Sargans the capital of a bailliage of the same name belonging to the eight antient cantons  Let me remark by the way that in Swisserland there are two sorts of bailliages the one consisting of certain districts into which all the aristocratical cantons are divided and over these a particular officer called a  bailiff  is appointed by government to which he is accountable for his administration the  other sort are the territories that do not make part of the districts of the cantons but are subject to two or more of them who by turns appoint a bailiff This officer when not restrained by the peculiar privilege of certain districts has the care of the police jurisdiction in civil and criminal causes with some limitations and has a stated revenue arising in different places from different duties and taxes In case of exaction or maladministration an appeal always lies from the bailiff to the cantons to which the bailliage belongs and the place the time and the members who receive the appeal are all regulated with the utmost exactness With respect to this of Sargans and the others belonging to the eight antient cantons conjointly at the conclusion of the general diet held annually at Frauenfield in Thurgovy the deputies of these cantons resolve themselves into a Syndicate examine the accounts of the public revenues  as delivered in by the bailiffs of the respective districts and receive and judge all appeals in some cases finally but in the more important ones an appeal lies from this assembly to the superior tribunal of each canton The theory of this institution has a plausible appearance of impartiality but how far the practice accords with the theory I cannot pretend to determine Whether a bailiff who is guilty of extortion is easily brought to justice or more easily screened how far the members of the Syndicate are liable to influence or open to corruption how far the expence of appeals renders them in many cases impracticable to the poorer inhabitants are questions which cannot be answered but by a person far more informed concerning these courts of justice than I have had an opportunity to be  We arrived late at the town of Wallenstadt it is incorporated into the  bailliage of Sargans but enjoys several distinct privileges This little town derives its existence from being the passage of the merchandise transported from Germany through the Grisons to Italy This communication occasions the frequent resort hither of Italian merchants and that language is spoken by many of the inhabitants a circumstance of great satisfaction to me as from my ignorance of the German I have been frequently much streightened in obtaining all the information I want Our landlord speaks Italian and has been very accurate in his answers to my questions relating to the number of inhabitants the government of the town its dependence upon the bailiff its privileges c Nor is this to be wondered at for the innkeepers in Swisserland are mostly  burgesses  and are frequently  members  of the sovereign council besides that from the very nature of their governments the Swiss in general are  well informed of every thing relating to their particular constitutions I have also held a long conversation in the same language with a burgess of Glaris who has furnished me with some information I can depend upon in relation to that canton which we purpose visiting tomorrow I endeavour to ascertain the truth of these informations by procuring as many as I can from different persons of all ranks by laying them together and then comparing them with the written accounts if there be any  Our stay is so short in most of the places we pass through that I cannot expect to gain an accurate knowledge of every circumstance I wish to be acquainted with but though I may omit many things that are worthy of your curiosity yet I shall attest nothing of the truth of which I am not perfectly convinced It is the fault of many travellers to write from what they have read and not from what they have seen  and to exaggerate the relations of others but I promise you that I will describe nothing of which I have not been an eyewitness The remarks I shall transmit to you will be the genuine result of my own feelings and I had even rather be frequently wrong in my sentiments and reflections than servilely follow the observations of others On this you may therefore depend that though the conclusions may perhaps be false the facts will certainly be true and I flatter myself you will readily pardon any error in judgment when my intention is neither to exaggerate or to deceive  Wesen  July  The lake of Wallenstadt is about sixteen miles in length and two in breadth it is entirely bounded by exceeding high mountains except to the east and west From this situation a breeze generally blows from those two quarters beginning at the break of day and continuing  for some hours then changes from west to east till sunset this breeze is very convenient for the transportation of the merchandise Sometimes however a violent northwind rushes down from the mountains and renders the navigation dangerous We were assured by the inhabitants and by the watermen who rowed us from Wallenstadt to this place that the breeze above mentioned was generally constant but we cannot attest it from our own experience as we set out this morning about eight and the wind was directly contrary the whole way blowing from west to east The weather 'tis true was heavy overcast and rainy which might cause perhaps this occasional variation  The lake is uncommonly wild and picturesque and affords a perpetual variety of beautiful and romantic scenes On the side of Glaris the mountains which border upon the lake are chiefly cultivated enriched with wood or fine  meadows and studded with cottages churches and small villages the Alps of Glaris rising behind their tops covered with snow On the other side for the most part the rocks are exceedingly grotesque craggy inaccessible and perpendicular but here and there a few cultivated necks of land are formed at the very edge of the lake and at the bottom of these very rocks exhibiting a beautiful contrast to the barrenness above and around them Numberless waterfalls occasioned by the meltings of the snows fall down the sides of these rocks from a very considerable heighth and with an almost inconceivable variety some of them seeming to glide gently in circular directions others forming vast torrents and rushing into the lake with noise and violence all of them changing their form and their position as we approached or receded from them The lake is exceedingly clear deep and cold and as we were informed never freezes  There is nothing remarkable in this place being a small village situated almost upon the point where the river Linth issues from the lake of Wallenstadt that little river is joined by the Limmat and falls into the lake of Zuric  I am c  LETTER VI  Glaris  July  THE canton of Glaris was formerly subject to the abbess of the convent of Seckinguen in Suabia the people however enjoyed very considerable privileges and a democratical form of government under the administration of a mayor appointed by the abbess but chosen among the inhabitants Towards the latter end of the thirteenth century the emperor Rodolph I obtained the exclusive administration of  justice and not long afterwards his son Albert having purchased the mayoralty which had insensibly become hereditary reunited in his person the whole civil and judicial authority Accordingly that prince and his immediate descendents the dukes of Austria oppressed the people and ruled over them with an absolute sway In Schweitz assisted by Zuric Lucerne Uri and Underwalden expelled the Austrians from the country of Glaris reestablished the democracy and restored liberty to the people Glaris now entered into a perpetual alliance with its deliverers and was received into the Helvetic confederacy with some restrictions which were not abolished until At that time it was the sixth canton but is now the last in rank of the eight  antient  cantons as they are called being so distinguished because from the accession of Zug and Berne in more than a century elapsed before  a new member was admitted These  antient  cantons have also several privileges superior to the five others the latter having submitted to some particular restrictions upon their being received into the Helvetic league  The people of Glaris enjoyed their liberties unmolested till when the Austrians made an irruption into the canton with a force sufficient as they arrogantly thought totally to subdue it pillaging the country and massacring the inhabitants It was then that three hundred and fifty troops of Glaris assisted by thirty Switzers resisted the whole strength of the Austrian army the former were posted advantageously upon the mountains and the latter to the number of fifteen thousand at a village called Naefels In this situation the Austrians began the attack but were soon compelled to retreat with great precipitation by a shower of stones poured upon them  from the heighths in this moment of confusion the inhabitants rushed down upon the enemy with such redoubled fury that they broke their ranks and having made an immense slaughter forced the remainder to retire from the canton These surprising victories gained by a handful of men against an enemy so much superior in number instances of which are by no means rare in the history of Swisserland render the wonderful combats of Marathon and Plataea when the Greeks repulsed the numerous hosts of the whole Persian empire perfectly credible The same love of independence the same dread of slavery and the same attachment to their country animated the respective nations to the same deeds of heroism and in both instances victory was followed by the same glorious consequence for the Swiss as well as the Greeks owe the rise and preservation of their liberties to that magnanimous and determined  valour which prefers death to living under the servile domination of an arbitrary despot The people still celebrate the anniversary of this victory which insured their independence for ever and I saw near the village of Naefels several stones with no other inscription than an inscription which no more requires explanation to an inhabitant of the canton than the glorious aera of to an Englishman  In the sixteenth century the reformation was introduced into this canton but not exclusively both religions are tolerated and the two sects live together in the greatest harmony This union is the more remarkable when we consider the fatal quarrels that have been kindled in Swisserland on account of religious tenets and that in Appenzel the division between the two sects is distinctly marked by their inhabiting different districts and living under separate  governments In several parts of this canton the Protestants and Catholics perform service in the same church one after the other and all the offices of state are amicably administered by the two parties During the present and the preceding century the Protestants have encreased considerably in number and their industry in every branch of commerce is greatly superior an evident proof how much the bigotry and superstition of the church of Rome fetters the genius and depresses the powers of exertion  The government is entirely democratical every person of the age of sixteen has a vote in the  Landsgemeind  or general assembly which is annually held in an open plain This assembly ratifies new laws lays contributions enters into alliances declares war and makes peace The  Landamman  is the chief of the republic and is chosen alternately from the two sects with this difference  that the  Protestant  remains three years in office the  Catholic  only two The manner of election is as follows five candidates are chosen by the people and these draw lots for the charge The other great officers of state and the bailiffs are taken also by lot from a certain number of candidates proposed by the people The executive power is vested in the council of regency composed of fortyeight Protestants and fifteen Catholics each sect has its particular court of justice and when there is any process between two persons of different religions the casting voice among the five or nine judges who are to determine the cause is always of the same religion as the defendant  Cattle cheese and butter constitute the principal commerce of the canton The cattle are fed in summer upon the Alps and it is computed that ten thousand head of large cattle and four thousand sheep are pastured during that  season upon the mountains belonging to this canton There are also some manufactures of linen and the inhabitants make a considerable quantity of thread  July  I am just returned to Glaris after having made an excursion towards the extremity of the canton it is entirely enclosed by the alps except towards the north and there is no other entrance but through this opening which lies between the lake of Wallenstadt and the mountains separating the canton of Glaris from that of Schweitz Footpassengers indeed may in summer traverse these alps to the Grisons on one side and to Urion the other but these paths which even in the midst of summer are barely passable are in winter absolutely impracticable At the entrance abovementioned the canton reaches from the banks of the Linth to the farthest  extremity of its alps about thirty miles forming a valley which becomes narrower as you advance and is scarcely more than a musketshot in breadth at the burgh of Glaris It afterwards opens by degrees and about a league from the lastmentioned burgh is divided by the Freyberg mountains at the point of this division the two rivers Limmat and Sernft unite  We continued through the largest of these vales which though very narrow is exceedingly populous You have been at Matlock in Derbyshire and I remember your admiration of its beautiful and romantic situation the scenery of this vale is of the same cast but infinitely more picturesque more wild more varied and more sublime The Limmat is much broader and more rapid than the Derwent and the hillocks of the Peake for I may so call them comparatively are mere molehills to the alps of Glaris These stupendous  chains of rocks are absolutely perpendicular approach one another so near and are so high that the sun may be said to set even in summer at four in the afternoon On each side are numbers of those waterfalls we had been so struck with during our passage over the lake of Wallenstadt one in particular near the village of Ruti that foamed down the steep sides of a mountain from the midst of a hanging grove of trees I was so captivated with these enchanting scenes that I could not help stopping every moment to admire them as often as I did so our guide not conceiving it possible that these delays could be owing to any other cause than the laziness of his horse never failed to strike the poor beast and continually awakened me out of my rapturous contemplations As I could not speak to be understood in German it was some time before I could make him comprehend by signs  that I stopped by choice and wished to go my own pace After having rode about ten miles we quitted our horses and walked Near Leugelbach a considerable rivulet is formed at once by two streams bursting from the ground at the foot of a mountain which after a few paces unite and fall into the Limmat besides these two principal branches there are several other smaller ones together with numberless little fountains that gush from the rockThe clearness of the streams their rapidity and murmuring sound the trees that hang over the point from whence they issue the rude rocks above the rich meadows and the scattered hamlets aroundall together form an assemblage of the most lively and pleasing objects that ever entered into a beautiful landscape  We crossed the Limmat several times which runs through the valley with all the violence of a torrent and  came at length to an amphitheatre of mountains where the vale ended on our righthand a fall more considerable than any we had yet seen tumbling down perpendicularly a bare rock in a large body of water the alps on each side crowned with inaccessible forests and covered with everlasting snow before us a pyramidical mountain bare and craggy and the glaciers of Glaris closing the view Here the vale and the habitable part of the canton terminate We then quitted the plain and ascending through a wild forest of beech and pines continued more than an hour mounting a very steep and rugged path till we came to the PantenBruck a bridge over the cataract that forms the Limmat which is here called the Sandbach it roars from the glacier down the steep mountain in one unbroken fall and a little way before its arrival under the bridge works itself a subterraneous passage through  the rock where it is lost only to appear again dashing out with increased violence and precipitation This bridge is a single arch of stone of about seventy feet in length thrown over a precipice of above three hundred feet in depth It serves as a communication with the upper alps and is the passage for the cattle which are fed there during the summer months on the other side some goats came jumping around us and seemed to welcome us to their dreary habitations These mountains are covered with a vast variety of rare herbs and beautiful sweetscented flowers which made me regret that I had not pursued my botanical studies As I leaned upon the parapet of the bridge and looked down into the chasm beneath my head almost turned giddy with the heighth The rock down which the Sandbach drives is composed of slate of which there is a great quantity in this canton the principal mine is  in the valley of Sernft where they make large slabs that serve for tables and which form a considerable article for exportation After we had continued some time admiring the sublime horror of the scenery we descended into the vale and made a hearty meal upon some excellent bread honey butter and milk which a neighbouring cottage supplied us with As the canton almost entirely consists of rich meadows the milk and butter are delicious and the honey of these mountainous countries is most exquisite Nothing delights me so much as the inside of a Swiss cottage all those I have hitherto visited convey the liveliest image of cleanliness ease and simplicity and cannot but strongly impress upon the observer a most pleasing conviction of the peasant's happiness  If I had never seen these little democratical states I could have formed no idea of the general equality and indistinction  that prevails among the inhabitants All the houses like those of Appenzel are built of wood large solid and compact with great penthouse roofs that hang very low and extend beyond the area of the foundation This peculiar structure is of use to keep off the snow and from its singularity accords surprisingly with the beautiful wildness of the country The houses of the richer inhabitants in the principal burghs are of the same materials the only difference consists in their being larger  If that sort of government be confessedly the best which constitutes the greatest good of the greatest number in the community these little states notwithstanding the natural defects of a democratical constitution may justly claim a large share of our approbation General liberty general independence and an exemption from arbitrary taxes are blessings which amply compensate  for a want of those refinements that are introduced by opulence and luxury However it is only in these small republics and in such a state of society that this kind of general democracy can have place where there are not any persons so rich as to gain an undue ascendency over the people by largesses and where if they err in their councils it is an error of the judgment and not of the heart When a general corruption of the latter prevails the evil is incurable because the laws cannot reach it In democracies the machine of government is considerably indeed clogged by that variety of wheels required to put it into motion but at the same time it is not necessary here that its motions should be sudden and expeditious as there is no fear of an invasion from without and as the people have no conquests either to make or to defend their principal policy consisting in maintaining their independence and in preserving the public tranquillity  The police is well regulated throughout Swisserland and even in these democratical states liberty does not degenerate into licentiousness we may except perhaps the day of their general assemblies when it is impossible to prevent some degree of confusion in a meeting where there is scarcely any distinction of persons and where every peasant considers himself as equal to the first magistrate  Our host is an openhearted honest Swiss he brings his pint of wine with him sits down to table with us and chats without the least ceremony There is a certain forwardness of this kind which I cannot bear when it apparently is the effect of impertinent curiosity or fawning officiousness but the present instance of frank familiarity arising as it evidently does from a mind conscious of its natural equality and unconstrained by arbitrary distinctions is highly pleasing to me as I  prefer the simple demeanour of unsophisticated nature to all the false refinements of artificial manners  I am c  LETTER VII  Einsidlin  July  WE could not pass through this part of the country without making a pilgrimage to Einsidlin and paying our respects to this celebrated shrine an object of much devotion among the Catholics Einsidlin or Notre Dame des Hermites is a rich and magnificent abbey of Benedictines in the canton of Schweitz which owes its celebrity to the miraculous image as it is called of the Virgin Mary The ridiculous tales they relate of the origin and aggrandisement of this abbey are so many melancholy instances of the credulity of the darker ages  that they are still believed in the present enlightened century must be attributed to the force of habitual prejudice and at the same time proves how difficult it is for the human mind to shake off those superstitious errors which it has early imbibed under the sanctified name of religion  In the ninth century a certain hermit called Meinrad was the first who retired to this place where he built a chapel and was assassinated by robbers But shall I tell you or what is more to the purpose will you believe me if I tell you that this murder was discovered by two crows who followed the assassins to Zuric where they were seized and executed Soon after this the dead body of St Meinrad must of course work miracles and all the world pilgrimises to his bones The sanctity of this place being thus established some one for whether it were St Benno or St Eberhard or  what other saint I cannot precisely determine built another chapel which he dedicated to the Virgin and laid the first foundation of the abbey having bequeathed for that purpose all his fortune and the pious fund was soon considerably augmented by subsequent donations Shall I tell you also that in Conrad bishop of Constance as he was going to consecrate the chapel heard a voice from heaven assuring him that God himself had consecrated it Whatever was its origin and whoever was its founder crouds of pilgrims resort hither from all quarters to adore the Virgin and to present their offerings and it is computed that upon the most moderate calculation their number amounts yearly to The circumjacent country was formerly one continued forest which since the erection of the abbey has been gradually converted into rich pastures and beautiful meadows and  this is a miracle which the Virgin in a certain sense may truly be said to have performed  August  I have just been visiting the abbey the chapel of the Virgin and her immense treasures The church of the abbey is a large and magnificent building but exhibits a remarkable specimen of false taste by being loaded with bad paintings and superfluous ornaments In the isle not far from the entrance is a small and elegant marble chapel of the Corinthian order this is the celebrated shrine of the Virgin to which the pilgrims resort On the outside an angel supports the following inscription  Hic est plena remissio peccatorum omnium a culpá et poenâ  Over the door is a plate of silver with five holes into which I saw several persons thrusting their fingers and praying at the same time with great fervour  upon enquiry I found that the credulous people believed these holes to be the marks of God's fingers In the inside of this chapel is the image of the Virgin which vies with the lady of Loretto both in  beauty  of countenance and richness of apparel her face as well as that of the child she holds in her arms being black She is richly dressed and every week she changes her garment her wardrobe consisting of fiftytwo different suits  The riches of the treasury are immense containing an infinite number of offerings of gold silver and precious stones arranged in the most ridiculous manner imaginable There were also skulls and bones richly ornamented whole skeletons of saints in masquerade and of ladies with ruffles flycaps and splendid apparel as if dressed for a ball What a wretched insult upon poor human nature I could not help considering them with a mixture of pity and indignation as  the offerings of ignorance before the shrine of bigotry and superstition The miracles which the Virgin has wrought in this country are infinite if we may judge from the prodigious number of figures of ears eyes legs arms heads c presented by those who fancied themselves respectively cured in those several members by the power of this wonderworking image  I was glad however to find in the midst of this superstitious trumpery a good library which contained some very fine editions of the classics  In this place there is a considerable traffic carried on of rosaries crosses little images c and there are rows of shops where nothing is to be purchased but these necessary appendages of the Roman catholic religion it has all the appearance of a fair There is also a room in the abbey where the same kind of merchandise is exposed to sale and one of the friars attends to  receive your money and very gravely assures you that the several articles have touched the sacred image Among other curiosities of this kind I purchased two ribands for two pence each with the following inscription upon them  Ce Ruban entier est la longueur jusqu'au trait est l'epaisseur de l'image de notre dame des hermites Il a touché l'image miraculeuse  Is it credible that in this enlightened age the most notorious superstition and imposture can appear thus barefaced I must confess that these impositions raise my indignation and though it  "exceeds all power of face"  to keep one's countenance at their glaring absurdity yet every friend to true religion cannot at the same time but feel sensibly shocked to see the purity of genuine christianity thus shamefully disguised and prostituted  This abbey consisting of sixty Benedictines that elect the abbot who is  titular prince of the empire is very rich and has considerable revenues in the canton of Zuric  Rapperschwyl  August  The evening yesterday being fine and cool I walked from Einsidlin to this place After we had ascended about three miles a fine view of the lake of Zuric and of the adjacent country opened upon us at once The prospect was extensive and beautiful the solemn stillness of the evening the calmness of the lake and the tints of the setting sun which glowed around the horison very much improved its charms When we arrived at the lake the moon began to rise and throwing its beams across the water formed another scene more mild indeed but not less affecting We then crossed the bridge of Rapperschwyl built over the narrowest part of the lake it measured near paces The town is pleasantly situated  upon a neck of land or promontory that juts out into the lake It formerly put itself under the protection of Uri Schweitz Underwalden and Glaris with a reserve of all its privileges but these cantons shamefully oppressing the inhabitants and encroaching upon their liberties Zuric and Berne took possession of the town in and restored to them their antient rights From that period Rapperschwyl has been under the protection of Zuric Berne and Glaris the latter having preserved its right by its neutr lity By this treaty the town recovered its former prerogatives and the inhabitants in testimony of their gratitude have placed the following inscription over the gates  Amicis Tutoribus floret libertas  They are all Catholics  Yours c  LETTER VIII  Zuric  August  YESTERDAY we dined luxuriously with the Capuchin friars at Rapperschwyl who seldom regale their guests in so sumptuous a manner It was one of their great feastdays and accordingly they gave us every possible variety of freshwater fish with which the lake and the neighbouring rivers abound The convent is built upon the edge of the water and commands from some of the apartments a very agreeable prospect the library is by far the pleasantest room though not the most frequented The cells of the monks are small and yet not inconvenient but cleanliness does not seem to constitute any part of their moral or religious observances Indeed the very habit of the order is ill calculated for that purpose as they wear no shirt or stockings and are clothed in a coarse  kind of brown drugget robe which trails upon the ground Strange idea of sanctity as if dirt could be acceptable to the Deity I reflected with particular satisfaction that I was not born a member of the Roman Catholic church as perhaps the commands of a parent a sudden disappointment or a momentary fit of enthusiasm might have sent me to a convent of Capuchins and have wedded me to dirt and superstition for life  After dinner we took leave of our hosts and departed for Zuric by water the lake is near ten leagues in length and one in breadth This body of water is not near so large as that of Constance but the borders are studded thicker with villages and towns and as we approached Zuric the edges of the lake were skirted with a continued range of villas which being intermixed among vineyards and pasturegrounds produced a most pleasing effect The adjacent country is finely cultivated and well  peopled and the southern part of the lake appears at some little distance bounded with the high stupendous mountains of Schweitz and Glaris the scenery all together is picturesque lively and diversified  Zuric was formerly an imperial city and obtained from the emperor Frederic II very considerable privileges which were acknowledged and augmented by several of his successors The civil war between the magistrates and the people in was very near reducing the city to ruins but the former being banished the citizens in established a new form of government which was confirmed by the emperor Louis of Bavaria The exiles after several fruitless attempts were at length readmitted but it being discovered that they had engaged in a conspiracy against the citizens they were all of them put to death In consequence of this transaction the nobles in the neighbourhood took up arms against the town the latter after  having applied ineffectually for assistance to the emperor Charles IV entered into an alliance with the four cantons Lucerne Uri Schweitz and Underwalden and was admitted a member of their confederacy This event happened in the year The four cantons yielded the preeminence to Zuric which privilege it enjoys at present being the first canton in rank and the most considerable in extent both of territory and power next to Berne The same year in which Zuric entered into this alliance she was assisted by the four cantons abovementioned against Albert duke of Austria who besieged the town and was repulsed with great loss  Zuric was the first town in Swisserland that separated from the church of Rome being converted by the arguments of Zuingle  Of all the reformers the mild and elegant Melancthon alone excepted Zuingle seems to merit peculiar esteem he possessed to a great degree that spirit of meekness moderation and charity which are the characteristics of true christianity and amidst all the disputes between the Lutherans and the reformed churches was a constant advocate for peace and reconciliation He appears i  eed to have been perfectly free as well from that narrow bigotry which makes no distinction between points of the merest indifference and objects of the greatest importance as from that overbearing pride which while it violently condemns the opinions of others assumes to itself infallibility with respect to its own In a word it was his persuasion that provided christians agree in the most essential articles they ought meekly to bear with any difference upon subjects less uncontrovertible and which do not necessarily influence morals  That celebrated  reformer was born Jan at Vildehausen a small village in the Tockenbourg and when very young was appointed curate of Glaris Even before the publication of the sale of indulgences by Leo X which was the more immediate cause of the reformation Zuingle had exposed at Glaris several superstitions of the church of Rome and he gained additional credit by  preaching at Einsidlin against vows pilgrimages and offerings After the publication of the sale of indulgences while Luther was undermining the fabric of papal authority in Germany Zuingle was no less successful in Swisserland By his zeal and intrepidity and by the irresistible force of truth he gained so many converts at Zuric where he had been invited to preach that in the magistrates abolished the mass and other Catholic ceremonies and introduced the reformed religion The disputes between the two sects were carried on with more temper and moderation than is usual in religious controversies The change which had been some time in agitation was finally determined by a plurality of voices in the sovereign council and the people readily and chearfully obeyed the decision of their magistrates The example of Zuric was soon followed by Berne Schaffhausen Basil with part of  Glaris and Appenzel the other cantons continuing to adhere to the religion of their ancestors From this period the two religions have been established in Swisserland but that harmony which had hitherto been preserved between them has occasionally been interrupted Indeed even so early as the year religious disputes broke out with so much violence and animosity as to occasion the first civil war among the cantons in which the Protestants were defeated and Zuingle lost his life at the battle of Cappel  It has been urged against Zuingle as a proof of his persecuting principles that he was personally engaged in this war against the Catholics To this it may be answered That he had used every argument in his power to bring about a reconciliation between the contending parties that he even openly arraigned the impatient and turbulent zeal of his fellowcitizens that he acted in obedience to one of the fundamental laws of the republic and that he accompanied the army by the express command of the magistrates  Since that period  two other religious wars have been kindled one in in which the Catholics gained the advantage and the other in when the Protestants proved victorious The peace of Araw which put an end to these unhappy disputes has it is to be hoped finally settled all religious differences By that treaty which may be considered as a sort of code of toleration among the Swiss the treatment of the Protestants and Catholics in the common bailliages is regulated The first article stipulates that in all the provinces which are subject to cantons of different religion there shall be a perfect equality between the two sects and that they shall both enjoy the same privileges to which is added an express prohibition to each party not to make use of any terms of raillery or contempt in speaking of their respective worships  This canton abounds in corn wine and excellent pastures it is miles by  and exceedingly populous containing about an hundred and fifty thousand souls of which there are upwards of twelve thousand in the capital The sovereignty resides exclusively in the burgesses of the town consisting in all of about two thousand which peculiar restriction arises from the following circumstanceDuring the earlier ages of the republic the town being in possession of but a small extent of territory the citizens of course exercised the powers of sovereignty and when they afterwards gradually obtained considerable acquisitions either by conquest or purchase they still reserved to themselves this preeminence all their new subjects being excluded from any share in the government This remark will hold good with respect to the seven aristocratical cantons I cannot but add that a very narrow spirit of policy reigns throughout most of the states of Swisserland as they seldom or never  make a new citizen This rule however in some of the republics is less scrupulously observed than in others In Zuric indeed the citizens are so tenacious of their privileges that as I was informed by one of their magistrates it is now an hundred and fifty years since they have admitted a new citizen The burgesses besides the advantage of electing their magistrates and of aspiring to the administration of affairs enjoy the sole right of commerce all strangers and even subjects of the canton being excluded from carrying on any trade in the city  The citizens or burgesses of Zuric are divided into thirteen tribes one of these consists of persons who do not profess any trade and are called the nobles It is somewhat extraordinary that in a republic absolutely commercial such a distinction should be made and that commerce should in any respect be considered as a degradation All the other citizens  following commerce or exercising any trade are distributed among the twelve remaining classes  The legislative authority is vested by the burgesses in the sovereign council of two hundred consisting however of two hundred and twelve members drawn from the thirteen tribes and comprising the senate or little council The latter is composed of twentyfour tribunes taken equally from twelve of the tribes and four counsellors chosen by the tribe of the nobles to these are added twenty counsellors elected by the sovereign council and all these with the two burgomasters make fifty members Half of this little council administer the office during six months at the end of which they are succeeded by the other half the president of each division is one of the burgomasters who are both chosen by the sovereign council and confirmed annually They have jurisdiction in all causes civil and  criminal in the former when the demand is of a certain importance an appeal lies from the senate to the council of two hundred but in criminal their sentence is final and when once passed there is no possibility of obtaining any reversal or mitigation An excellent maxim provided the judges are cautious and circumspect and the laws mild for there is no greater encouragement to the commission of crimes than the frequency of pardons Such an institution however ought necessarily to exclude severity of punishment and could never be admitted in a state where by the letter of the law the same punishment is inflicted upon him who steals a sheep as upon the man who murders his father  Great therefore is the power of the senate considered in their collective capacity being absolute judges in all criminal causes guardians of the police and the select body of men from  whom the principal magistrates are chosen But as too great a power of individuals is dangerous in a republic the several members of this assembly are liable to be changed and a revision or confirmation is annually made in some instances by the sovereign council in others by the particular tribes to which the senators belong This annual revision is a great check to maladministration and at the same time prevents the senate from gaining so great an influence as to be detrimental to the liberties of the people A burgess is qualified to vote at twenty is eligible into the sovereign council at thirty and into the senate at thirtyfive By these wise regulations a man must have had some experience in public affairs before he is capable of holding a charge of any consequence The revenues of government are more than proportionate to the expences which are regulated with the strictest oeconomy The  state is not only without debts but a saving is yearly made and deposited in the public treasury for a resort upon any sudden emergency It was from this fund that the government supported the whole expence of the war in against the Catholic cantons without imposing any additional tax  Sumptuary laws as well as those against immorality are here well observed The former indeed may exist and be carried into execution even among a people much corrupted for it may be the policy of government to enforce their observance But the severest penalties will not be sufficient to prevent crimes of an immoral tendency amidst a general dissoluteness of manners it is the popular principles that can alone invigorate such laws and give them their full operation Among the Romans the laws against adultery were severe and yet where was adultery more practised than at Rome In Zuric it  is rigorously punished without any distinction of rank by fine by expulsion from office and by imprisonment but the frequency of this crime is not so much restrained by the penalty annexed to it as from the general good morals of the inhabitants Secret crimes cannot be prevented but it is an evident proof of public virtue when open breaches of immorality are discountenanced Among their sumptuary laws the use of a carriage in the town is prohibited to all sorts of persons except strangers and it is almost inconceivable that in a place so very commercial and wealthy luxury should so little prevail  At Zuric there is more of the original Swiss spirit of independence than in any of the large towns of this country The magistrates less influenced by foreign courts and above corruption consult always the real advantage of their canton and of the Helvetic confederacy  Zuric still preserves in the general diet a very considerable sway which she derives more from the opinion entertained of her integrity than from her power she is looked up to as one of the most independent and upright of the thirteen cantons  The city of Zuric stands upon a gentle eminence on the northern extremity of the lake a beautiful situation and advantageous for commerce For by means of the river Limmat which issues from the lake and dividing the town falls into the Aar there is a communication with the Rhine And this advantage has not been neglected as the trade of the town is very extensive The inhabitants are exceedingly industrious and carry on with success several different branches of manufacture the principal is that of crape Their chief traffic is with France Russia Italy and Holland  Since the reformation many persons  have flourished here eminent for their learning in all branches of literature and there is no town in Swisserland where letters are more encouraged or where they are cultivated with greater success I waited this morning upon the celebrated Gesner author of the death of Abel and of several idyls which for their delicate and elegant simplicity are justly esteemed They abound with those nice touches of exquisite sensibility which discover a mind warmed with the finest sentiments and love is represented in the chastest colouring of innocence virtue and benevolence Nor has he confined his subjects merely to the tender passion paternal affection and filial reverence gratitude humanity in short every moral duty is exhibited and inculcated in the most pleasing and affecting manner He has for some time renounced poetry in order to take up the pencil and painting is at present his favourite amusement  A treatise which he has published on landscapepainting shews the elegance of his taste and the versatility of his genius while his compositions in both kinds prove the resemblance of the two arts and that the conceptions of the poet and of the painter are congenial I prefer his drawings in black and white to his paintings for although the ideas in both are equally beautiful or sublime his colouring is inferior to his design He is preparing an handsome edition of his writings in quarto in which every part of the work is carried on by himself he prints them at his own private press and is at once both the drawer and engraver of his plates It is to be lamented that he has renounced poetry for while ordinary writers spring up in great plenty authors of real genius are rare and uncommon His drawings are seen only by a few and will scarcely be known to posterity  but his writings are dispersed abroad translated into every language and will be admired by future ages as long as there remains any relish for true pastoral simplicity or any taste for original composition He is plain in his manners open affable and obliging in his address and of singular modesty he has nothing of the poet in his appearance except in his eye which is full of sense fire and expression  We waited also on Mr Lavater a clergyman of Zuric and celebrated physiognomist who has published a famous treatise on that fanciful subject He expressed himself badly in French but there was an agreeable warmth and vivacity in his countenance and manner while he conversed upon his favourite subject That particular passions have a certain effect upon particular features is evident to the most common observer and it may be conceived that an habitual indulgence of these passions may  possibly in some cases impress a distinguishing mark upon the countenance but that a certain cast of features constantly denotes certain passions and that by contemplating the former we can infallibly discover also the mental qualities of the owner is an hypothesis liable I should think to so many exceptions that no general and uniform system could be justly formed upon it Nevertheless Mr Lavater like a true enthusiast carries his theory much farther for he not only pretends to discover the characters and passions by the features by the complexion by the form of the head and by the motion of the arms but he also draws some inferences of the same kind even from one's handwriting And indeed his system is formed upon such universal principles that he applies the same rules to all animated nature extending them not only to brutes but even to insects That the temper of a horse may be discovered  by his countenance will not strike you as any thing absurd but did you ever hear before that any quality could be inferred from the physiognomy of a Bee or of an Ant While I give you my opinion thus freely concerning Mr Lavater's notions you will readily perceive that I am not one of those who are initiated into the mysteries of his art Nor do I mean to censure indiscriminately the system of that celebrated writer for notwithstanding the extravagance of some of his tenets the severest critics allow that there is a fund of good sense and a variety of fine observations dispersed throughout his treatise and that it is one of those works which to be admired needs only to be read with attention  The clergy of Zuric are in general better paid than in the other Protestant cantons and among that body there are some who are very decently provided for a circumstance rather uncommon in the Reformed or Presbyterian churches  The public granary on account of its admirable institution deserves to be particularly mentioned Corn is purchased by government and given out to those who choose to buy it at the common prize but in seasons of scarcity it is sold considerably cheaper than it can be bought at the market The use of this institution appeared in the late dearth when bread from the dearness of corn was sold at ten pence the pound government delivered the same quantity for four pence  The arsenal is well supplied with cannon arms and ammunition and contains a reserve of muskets for thirty thousand men We saw there and admired some of the twohanded swords and weighty armour of the old Swiss warriors as also the bow and arrow with which William Tell is said to have shot the apple off the head of his son  This canton has a regiment and some companies in France a regiment in  Holland and some companies in the service of the King of Sardinia It has long been a question how far Swisserland has been benefited by enlisting her subjects in foreign armies But without entering into that enquiry I shall only observe that Zuingle violently declaimed against this practice as introducing a corruption of morals and he had interest sufficient to prevent Zuric from joining in the general alliance which all the Swiss cantons entered into with Francis I Since that period Zuric continued firm in her refusals until the reign of Henry IV when this canton finally acceded to the treaty with that monarch  I am c  LETTER IX  Zug  August  WE walked yesterday to Albis a small village about three leagues from Zuric situated upon the summit of a steep mountain which commands a fine view of that town the lake and its environs We were lucky in escaping a violent shower of rain accompanied with a storm of thunder and lightning which had threatened for some time and began immediately upon our arrival but we were well housed and our host gave us a good supper and an excellent bottle of Muscat wine We were abroad this morning by five and had a very agreeable walk to this place the weather which had of late been very sultry being cooled by the lightning and rain We passed over the field of battle at Cappel where  Zuingle was killed and continued our way along the fields through a pleasant country so thickly planted with fruittrees that I could hardly distinguish any other sort Indeed we had before remarked the prodigious number of those trees in several other parts of Swisserland the country being in many places almost one continued orchard  Zug the capital of this canton and the only walled town among all the popular ones stands delightfully upon the edge of a beautiful lake in a fertile valley abounding with corn pastureground and fruittrees This canton formerly belonged to the House of Austria and it continued faithful to that family when the other neighbouring states had formed themselves into independent republics As it lies between Zuric and Schweitz the communication between those two cantons was kept up with difficulty and by this means frequent opportunities were afforded to the house of Austria  of invading and harrassing the Swiss Under these circumstances the six allied cantons in laid siege to Zug which was resolutely defended by the inhabitants but as Albert duke of Austria was in no condition to send them any assistance the town at length surrendered upon the most honourable conditions The generosity of the conquerors was equal to the courage and magnanimity of the vanquished for in consequence of this submission the inhabitants of the canton of Zug were delivered from the yoke of a foreign master obtained the most assured liberty and independence and were admitted into the Helvetic confederacy upon equal terms  The government of this little canton is exceedingly complicated and the inhabitants of this town have somewhat more influence and enjoy a greater share in the administration of affairs than those of the capital burghs in the  five other democratical cantons The supreme power resides in the inhabitants of the four districts of Zug Bar Egeri and Meutzingen who assemble yearly like those of Glaris and Appenzel to enact laws and to choose their magistrates The Landamman is elected by the suffrages of the whole collective districts but is taken alternately from each of the four communities abovementioned he continues three years in office when taken from the district of Zug and but two years when chosen from each of the three others And there is this peculiar difference between the five other cantons and that of Zug that whereas in the former the Landamman upon the expiration of his office always retains a considerable preeminence in the council of regency in the latter when he quits his charge he has not the least distinction above any other counsellor The general administration of affairs is entrusted to the council of regency  composed of forty members of which the district of Zug furnishes thirteen and the others are taken equally from the three remaining communities This council as well as the Landamman resides always in the capital town  Oswald one of our old British kings is the titular Saint of this place and in the church is his statue with the following inscription  Sanctus Oswaldus Rex Angliae Patronus hujus Ecclesiae  This Oswald was if I remember right a king of Northumberland in the seventh century and is much renowned among the monkish writers for his chastity piety and power of working miracles I have been endeavouring to make out what connection a British king under the heptarchy could have had with a small canton of Swisserland without reflecting how fruitless is the attempt to give any reason for absurd  customs In the church of Rome saints are easily transplanted into any soil and caprice as well as superstition may have inclined the inhabitants of Zug to adore a saint whose name is barely known in his own country  I am c  LETTER X  Lucerne  August  WE took boat at Zug and being rowed across the lake which is about three leagues long and one broad were landed at a small village in the canton of Schweitz From thence we walked to Kussnacht and in our way passed by a small chapel sacred to William Tell erected on the spot where it is said he shot the Austrian governor At Kussnacht we embarked upon the lake of Lucerne and were much struck  upon our approach with the fine view of that town which we thought superior even to Zuric in the beauty of its situation  Lucerne originally subject to the house of Austria was continually exposed to the inroads of Uri Schweitz and Underwalden after those cantons had secured their own liberty and independence All her commerce to Italy was by this means interrupted her fairs unfrequented and her citizens compelled to be ever in arms in order to protect their territory from incessant depredations Under these circumstances the house of Austria instead of giving the citizens any effectual assistance imprudently loaded them with additional taxes as exorbitant as they were unjust The consequence was that Lucerne made her peace with the confederate cantons and having soon after driven out the Austrian party entered into a perpetual alliance with Uri Schweitz  and Underwalden and became a member of the Helvetic confederacy  The accession of Lucerne gave additional credit and power to the confederacy and enabled it in to resist all the efforts of a great and implacable enemy In that year Leopold duke of Austria invaded the canton with a numerous army when the combined troops gained a bloody victory at Sempach in which Leopold lost his life In the accounts of this battle an instance of private valour in an individual is recorded which would have done honour to a Grecian or a Roman name and only wants the pen of a Thucydides or a Livy to be equalled in fame to the exploits of the most admired heroes of antiquity The Austrian army far superior in number was drawn up in firm battalion accoutred in heavy armour and furnished with long pikes which they presented before them The Swiss troops were led on to the attack  in the form of a wedge in order to open their way into the ranks of the enemy and to break the solidity of the battalion The latter nevertheless continuing for some time impenetrable Arnold de Winkelried a native of Underwalden rushed alone upon the enemy to certain death and seizing as many pikes as he could grasp endeavoured to force through the ranks but he was killed in the attempt His patriotic valour however was not exerted in vain it inflamed the Swiss with new courage and taught them the best method of penetrating into the battalion which they at length effected after the most desperate efforts of invincible resolution  Leopold himself might have escaped when his troops first began to give way but with a magnanimity worthy of a better fate he determined after having been a witness to the total rout of his army not to survive so ignominious  a day accordingly he rushed into the thickest of the enemy and was slain In the arsenal of this place are still preserved his armour together with a large quantity of cords which according to the tradition of the country he is said to have brought with him in order to bind the citizens of Lucerne The keeper of the arsenal displayed them to us with the same kind of triumph as the man who shews the Tower of London points out the chains that were taken on board the Spanish armada which he tells you Philip II destined for the principal nobility of England  The government of Lucerne is entirely aristocratical or rather indeed oligarchical There are five hundred citizens in the town from whom a council of one hundred comprising the senate or council of state are chosen The former is the nominal sovereign but the whole power actually resides in the latter  consisting of thirtysix members who are formed like that of Zuric into two divisions which exercise the office by rotation But the members of this senate are far from being subject to the same controul as at Zuric for they are neither confirmed by the sovereign council nor by the citizens but are only dependent upon themselves the division which retires at the end of six months confirming that which comes into office Besides the vacant places in the senate are filled up by their own body so that the power remains in the possession of a few patrician families and as the son generally succeeds his father or the brother his brother the senatorial dignity may be considered in some measure as hereditary  The administration of the current affairs the care of the police the management of the finances and the whole executive power resides in the senate which sits constantly whereas  the supreme council is assembled only upon particular occasions for the purposes of legislation and the like The senate has cognizance of criminal causes but in case of capital condemnation the sovereign council is convoked in order to pronourice the sentence a practice worthy of imitation for the condemnation of a criminal cannot be too maturely weighed and the more solemnity is used in pronouncing the sentence the greater effect it must have upon the minds of the people In civil causes an appeal lies from the senate to the sovereign council but this must be a mere formality as in effect it is an appeal from the senators in one court to the same senators in another Indeed their influence over the sovereign council must necessarily be absolute for they themselves constitute above a third of that body chuse their own members are in possession of the principal charges of government  and confer most of them and have the nomination to the vacant ecclesiastical benefices which are very considerable near two thirds of the revenues of the canton belonging to the clergy  The chiefs of the republic are two Avoyers who are chosen from the senate by the council of one hundred and are confirmed annually In all elections whatsoever the relations of the candidates to the third degree are excluded from voting and neither the father and the son nor two brothers can be members of the senate at the same time Excellent institutions one should think to prevent the too great influence of familyconnections excellent indeed in theory but useless in practice and this circumstancce proves that when the spirit of the constitution is purely oligarchical any laws passed in order to counteract the power of the nobles are mere cyphers In some few instances however the exorbitant authority  of the nobles is checked for in case of declaring war and peace forming new alliances or of imposing new taxes the citizens must be assembled and give their consent  As Lucerne is first in rank and power among the Catholic cantons all affairs relative to religion are treated of in the diet which assembles in this town every year composed of the deputies of those cantons and the pope's nuncio resides here The town contains scarcely three thousand inhabitants has no manufactures of any consequence and little commerce and as to learning it no where meets with less encouragement and consequently is less cultivated What a contrast to Zuric The population of the canton has considerably encreased within this century a sure proof of a mild and equitable government The inhabitants are as I am informed almost totally engaged in agriculture The southern parts of the canton are  chiefly mountainous and furnish for exportation cattle hides cheese and butter all the northern part is fruitful in corn the crops of which being more than sufficient for the consumption of the whole canton there is a constant exportation of this article from the weekly market held in the town to which the inhabitants of the neighbouring democratical cantons resort in order to purchase that and other necessaries in which their own country is deficient The overplus that is wanted to supply this market is drawn from Suabia and Alsace This commerce which together with the passage of the merchandise for Italy is the chief support of the town might be exceedingly improved and augmented considering its advantageous situation for the Reuss issues from the lake passes through the town and having joined the Aar falls into the Rhine  The whole of what is remarkable in  the town may be comprised in a very short description The cathedral and the Jesuits' church are the only public buildings worth observing but they are too much loaded with rich ornaments and disgraced by bad paintings In the cathedral is an organ of a fine tone and of an extraordinary size of the latter you may judge by the dimensions of the center pipe which as the priest assured me is forty feet in length and near three in breadth and weighs eleven hundred pounds The bridges which skirt the town round the edge of the lake are the fashionable walks of the place and are remarkable for their length They are covered at top and open at the sides by which means one has a constant view of this delightful and romantic country They are decorated with wretched paintings consisting of the histories of the Old Testament the battles of the Swiss and the dance of Death  Upon our arrival here yesterday we sent a letter of recommendation to general Pfiffer who received us immediately with his usual civility We had heard so much of a topographical representation he has formed of part of Swisserland that we were anxious to get a sight of it as indeed it well deserves particular notice and merits the most accurate attention of the curious traveller The ingenious artist is a native of Lucerne and general in the French service and has devoted his leisure time to the compleating of this work It is a model in relief and what is at present finished contains about sixty square leagues of the most mountainous parts of Swisserland namely part of the cantons of Lucerne Zug and Berne together with the whole of Uri Schweitz and Underwalden and the general has taken elevations and drawings for above as much more The model of what is completed is twelve  feet long and nine and a half broad The principal part is composed of wax the mountains of stone and the whole is coloured but what deserves more particular observation is that not only the woods of beech of pine c are differently marked but also the outward strata of the several mountains as well as their form are distinguished General Pfiffer has already been employed in this work about ten years with the utmost patience and assiduity he has himself raised the plans upon the spots taken the elevations of the mountains and laid them down in their several proportions The plan is so minutely exact that it takes in not only all the mountains lakes rivers towns villages and forests but every cottage every torrent every bridge and even every cross is distinctly and accurately represented In the prosecution of this laborious performance he has been twice arrested for a spy and in  the popular cantons has frequently been forced to work by moonlight in order to avoid the jealousy of the peasants who think their liberty would be endangered should so exact a plan be taken of their country As he is obliged to remain some time upon the tops of the Alps where no provision can be procured he generally carries with him a few shegoats whose milk supplies him with nourishment Indeed his perseverance in surmounting all the difficulties that necessarily have arisen in the course of this undertaking is almost inconceivable When he has finished any particular part he sends for the peasants who reside near the spot especially those who hunt the chamois and bids them examine accurately each particular mountain whether it corresponds as far as the smallness of the scale will admit with its natural appearance and then by frequently retouching he corrects the deficiencies  He takes all his elevations from the level of the lake of Lucerne which according to Mr De Saussure is about fourteen hundred and eight feet above the Mediterranean  This model exhibiting the most mountainous parts of Swisserland conveys a sublime picture of an immense body of alps piled one upon another as if the story of the Titans were realized and they had succeeded at least in one part of the globe in heaping an Ossa upon a Pelion and an Olympus upon an Ossa The general informed me and it is somewhat remarkable that the tops of the alps which cross Swisserland in the same line are nearly of the same level or in other words there are continued chains of mountains of the same elevation rising in progression to the highest range and from thence gradually descending in the same proportion towards Italy  He is exceedingly polite and affable to strangers and ever ready to be of any service to travellers in pointing out to them the best roads and in acquainting them with the places most worthy of observation From what I saw of him he seemed to be a man of a more lively imagination than one should have expected considering the indefatigable patience and laborious precision necessary for the execution of a work of this nature  Near Lucerne is Mount Pilate formerly called Mons  Pileatus  from the Latin word  pilea  its top being generally covered with a cloud or cap This word has been corrupted into  Pilatus  and from this alteration a thousand ridiculous stories have been invented among others that Pontius Pilate after having condemned our Saviour to death was seized with remorse made a little excursion into Swisserland and drowned himself in a lake which  is at the top of this mountain This corruption of a word and this absurd legend fabricated from its alteration will naturally remind you of several others of similar absurdity which are seriously related by the Greek writers a circumstance which my very worthy and learned friend Mr Bryant has so amply and ably discussed in his  Analysis of ancient Mythology  I am c  LETTER XI  Altdorf  August  THE Waldstaer See or the lake of the four cantons is by far the most beautiful and diversified body of water of this kind I have yet seen The upper branch or the lake of Lucerne is in the form of a cross the sides of which stretch from Kussnacht to Dallenwal a small village near Stancz  the capital of the canton of Underwalden It is bounded towards the town of Lucerne which forms a fine object upon its northwestern extremity by cultivated hills sloping gradually to the water contrasted on the opposite side by an enormous mass of barren and craggy rocks Mount Pilate rises boldly from the lake and is perhaps one of the highest mountains in Swisserland if estimated from its base and not from the level of the sea According to general Pfiffer its elevation above the lake is more than six thousand feet nevertheless its heighth above the Mediterranean is nothing in comparison with that of the alps we are going to visit nor indeed does the snow continue all the year upon its summit It is a single insulated mountain and is divided at its top into two rugged points which when not covered with clouds form a most majestic appearance  Towards the end of this branch the  mountains that border the lake approach and form an exceeding narrow creek scarcely a mile across soon after the lake widens again and we entered the second branch or the lake of Schweitz on the western side the canton of Underwalden on the eastern that of Schweitz Here the mountains are more lofty and infinitely varied some covered to their very summits with the most lively verdure others perpendicular and craggy here forming vast amphitheatres of wood there jutting into the water in bold promontories  On the eastern side of this branch is the small village or town of Gersaw situated at the foot of the Rugi it is the smallest republic in Europe Its territory is about a league in breadth and two in length consisting partly of a small neck of land at the edge of the lake and the remainder lying upon the rapid declivity of the Rugi In the village and scattered cottages there may  perhaps be about a thousand inhabitants they have their general assembly of burgesses their Landamman their council of regency their courts of justice and their militia I was told though I will not absolutely answer for the truth of it that there is not a single horse in the whole territory of the republic as indeed one might well suppose for the only way of getting to the town is by water excepting a narrow path down the steep sides of the mountain which is almost impassable This little republic is under the protection of the four cantons Lucerne Uri Schweitz and Underwalden and in case of war furnishes its quota of men To the ambitious politician who judges of governments by extent of dominion and power such a diminutive republic thrown into an obscure corner and scarcely known out of its own contracted territory must appear unworthy of notice but the smallest spot of earth  on which civil freedom is cultivated and flourishes cannot fail of being interesting to those who know the true value of liberty and independence and are convinced that political happiness does not consist in great riches and extensive empire  Towards the end of this branch the lake forms a considerable bay in the midst of which lies the village of Brunnen celebrated for the signing of the treaty in between Uri Schweitz and Underwalden From this point we had a glimpse of Schweitz the capital burgh of the canton about two miles from Brunnen it stands farther within the land at the bottom of two very high sharp and rugged rocks  Here we turned short to our righthand and entered the third branch or the lake of Uri the scenery of which is so amazingly grand and sublime that the impression it made upon me will never  be erased from my mind Imagine to yourself a deep and narrow lake about nine miles in length bordered on both sides with rocks uncommonly wild and romantic and for the most part perpendicular with forests of beech and pine growing down their sides to the very edge of the water indeed the rocks are so entirely steep and overhanging that it was with difficulty we could observe more than four or five spots where we could have landed On the righthand upon our first entrance a detached piece of rock at a small distance from the shore engaged our attention It rises to about sixty feet in heighth is covered with brushwood and shrubs and reminded me in some degree of those that shoot up in the middle of the fall of the Rhine near Schaffhausen but here the lake was as smooth as chrystal and the silent solemn gloom which reigned in this place was not less awful and affecting than the tremendous  roaring of the cataract in the other Somewhat farther upon the highest point of the Seelisberg we observed a small chapel that seemed inaccessible and below it the little village of Gruti near which the three heroes of these cantons are said to have met and to have taken reciprocal oaths of fidelity when they planned the famous revolution  See page    On the opposite side but farther on appears the chapel of William Tell erected in honour of that hero and upon the very spot where it is said he leaped from the boat in which he was carrying prisoner to Kussnacht It is built upon a rock that juts out into the lake under a hanging wood a situation amid scenes so strikingly awful as cannot fail of strongly affecting even the most dull and torpid imagination On the inside of this chapel the several actions of William Tell are badly painted While we were viewing them we observed  the countenances of our watermen glistened with exultation and they related to us with much spirit and sensibility the cruelties and tyranny of Gesler governor of Uri and the intrepid behaviour of their glorious deliverer Indeed I have frequently remarked with pleasure the national enthusiasm which so generally prevails in this country and have greatly admired the fire and animation with which the people discourse of those famous men among their ancestors to whom they are indebted for that happy state of independence which they now enjoy This laudable spirit is continually kept up and encouraged by the number of statues and other memorials of the antient Swiss heroes which are so common in every town and village throughout Swisserland Among these Tell is the most distinguished and he seems to be the peculiar favourite of the common people the reason is obvious for his  story partakes greatly of the marvellous  A man of letters at Berne has written a treatise entitled  Fable Danoise  in which he calls in question the history of William Tell His arguments in general are by no means conclusive he mentions however two circumstances which if true are convincing proofs that much fiction is interwoven with the whole account for the author asserts that the incident of Tell's shooting the apple off the head of his son is not recorded in any of the contemporary historians although they give the minutest accounts of the governor's tyranny and that the first writer who takes notice of it is Petermann Etterlin of Lucerne who lived in the latter end of the fifteenth century near two hundred years after the fact is supposed to have happened Besides a story of the same kind is related in the Danish annals of Saxo Grammaticus with no other difference  than that of names Herald king of Denmark supplying the place of the governor of Uri and Tocco that of William Tell and this event which is said to have happened in is attended also with nearly the same incidents as those recorded in the Swiss accounts  As Saxo Grammaticus is an author but little known and the passage in question being exceedingly curious the reader will find it inserted in the Appendix  Nevertheless it is far from being a necessary consequence that because the authenticity of the story concerning the apple is liable to some doubts  therefore  the whole tradition relating to Tell is fabulous Neither is it a proof against the reality of a fact that it is not mentioned by any contemporary historians The general history of William Tell is repeatedly celebrated in several old German songs so remarkable for their antient dialect and simplicity as almost  to raise the deeds they celebrate above all reasonable suspicion add to this the constant tradition of the country together with two chapels erected some centuries ago in memory of his exploits  The three cantons were so much offended with the author for throwing any doubt upon the actions of their antient hero that they presented a remonstrance to the sovereign council of Berne in consequence of which the pamphlet in question was publicly burnt at Uri In this instance their national prejudices if they really deserve that name become in some sort meritorious and respectable  The cross bow is still much used in these parts as I had an opportunity of observing upon our landing at Fluellen where I saw several very young boys each with a cross bow in his hand There happened to be a butt at a small distance from the place and I gave them  to understand that those who hit the mark should receive a penny for their dexterity Upon this intimation three boys took aim successively two of whom hit the very centre of the butt and obtained the prize accordingly but the third missing I made him shoot till he touched the mark which after two or three trials he at length performed  From Fluellen we walked to Altdorf the capital burgh of the canton of Uri situated in a narrow vale almost intirely surrounded by stupendous mountains It contains several neat houses the tops whereof are covered with large detached stones placed there in order to prevent the roofs being carried away by those violent storms that frequently rush down from the neighbouring mountains into this valley  When the greatest part of Helvetia was subject to the empire the inhabitants of Uri Schweitz and Underwalden had long enjoyed the most considerable  privileges particularly the right of being governed by their own magistrates the clergy and many of the nobles indeed had fiefs and subjects in those respective territories but the bulk of the people formed several communities almost totally independent During the twelfth century various disputes which these three cantons had with the emperors united them more firmly than ever and they were accustomed every ten years to renew formally their alliance with each other Such was their situation at the death of Frederic II in From this period or soon afterwards commences the interregnum in the empire during which time of anarchy and confusion the nobles and bishops endeavouring to extend their power and to encroach upon the privileges of the people Uri Schweitz and Underwalden put themselves under the protection of Rhodolph of Habsbourg who in being chosen  emperor terminated the interregnum Rhodolph had a revenue assigned to him by these cantons and he appointed a governor who had cognizance in all criminal causes the rights however and privileges of the people were expressly reserved  Rhodolph some time after his accession to the throne of the empire listened to the ambitious schemes of his son Albert duke of Austria who was desirous to form Helvetia into a dutchy For this purpose the emperor purchased the domains of several abbeys and other considerable fiefs in Swisserland as well in the canton of Schweitz as in the neighbouring territories The great increase of power which the emperor gained by this acquisition induced the three cantons to renew their alliance and to demand a confirmation of their privileges and their demands were granted Upon the death of Rhodolph Adolphus of Nassau succeeded him from  whom they obtained the same confirmation But when Albert was afterwards chosen emperor he refused to ratify it and in order totally to subdue the people he placed over them two governors who were guilty of many flagitious acts of tyranny and oppression  Under these circumstances Werner de Staffach of Schweitz Walther Furst of Uri and Arnold de Melchtall of Underwalden planned the famous revolution which took place January and restored liberty to the three cantons Albert while he was preparing to attack them was  The occasion of this assassination and the circumstances attending it were as followAlbert as guardian to his nephew John of Habsbourg had taken possession of his hereditary dominions in Suabia and refused to deliver them up to him under various pretences At length wearied with repeated solicitations to no purpose John entered into a conspiracy against his uncle with Rhodolph de Warth Ulric de Palme Walther d'Eschenbach and Conrad de Tagerfeld  The emperor dined at Baden in his way to Rheinfelds a town in the circle of Suabia where was the empress his wife with a considerable body of troops with which he proposed attacking the three cantons Contemporary historians who have recorded the minutest circumstances of this assassination relate that Albert was in very high spirits during the repast and that upon his nephew again entreating to be put into possession of his hereditary dominions the emperor with an air of banter placed a garland of flowers upon his head adding at the same time  "This will be more agreeable to you for the present than the cares of a troublesome government"  This taunt had such an effect upon the young man that he burst into tears flung away the flowers and could not be prevailed upon to sit down to the table  After dinner Albert continued his journey on horseback accompanied by his son Leopold the conspirators and the rest of his usual attendants and came near the town of Windisch in the canton of Berne to the Reuss Over this river there was no bridge but passengers were usually ferried upon a raft The conspirators passed over first and immediately after them Albert who rode gently on waiting for his son Leopold and the remainder of his suite As he was riding through a field not far from the castle of Habsbourg and opposite to the town of Brugg which lies on the other side of the Aar the assassins suddenly beset him One of them seizing his horse's bridle John of Habsbourg reproached him for his injustice in detaining his dominions and without waiting for an answer struck him on the neck with his sword Rhodolph de Warth wounded him in the side and Ulric de Palme clove his head with his sabre In this condition they left him expiring upon the ground  This assassination was committed the st of May in the open day and in the sight of his son Leopold and the rest of his court who had not as yet passed the river and though they were witnesses to the murder it was not in their power to give the emperor any assistance The field lies between the Aar and the Reuss not far from the junction of those two rivers and the very spot where he was massacred is marked by a convent erected by his wife Elisabeth and his daughterinlaw Agnes the widow of his son Rhodolph king of Bohemia the place was called Konigsfeld or King's field a name it retains to this day The remains of the emperor were buried in the convent of Witterling from whence they were afterwards transported to Spiol and there interred  The assassins escaped without being pursued and retired into the cantons of Uri Schweitz and Underwalden expecting to find a sure asylum in a nation which Albert was preparing to invade But those generous people detesting a crime of so atrocious a nature although committed upon the person of their greatest and most formidable enemy refused to give the murderers any protection D'Eschenbach concealed himself in the disguise of a common labourer during thirty years nor was his rank discovered till he confessed it upon his deathbed De Palme destitute of common necessaries died of extreme poverty and De Warth tied to a horse's tail like a common malefactor and dragged to the place of execution was broken upon the wheel Some historians relate that he was the first person who ever suffered that species of torture that he remained three days in the most dreadful agonies and that his wife such was the strange proof she gave of her affection attended him to the place of execution nor could be prevailed upon to withdraw herself till he expired John of Habsbourg commonly distinguished by the appellation of  parricide  from this assassination did not reap the benefit from his crime that he expected for by order of the emperor Henry VII he retired into a monastery of Augustin friars at Pisa where he died in  The widow of Albert turned her whole thoughts towards revenging the death of her husband and in this pursuit involved the innocent no less than the guilty for all who had  any  connection with the assassins suffered the same punishment and were sacrificed with undistinguishing cruelty to the manes of the deceased emperor Mean while the three cantons were left for a short time to the undisturbed enjoyment of their liberties and to strengthen themselves against any future attack and thus they innocently reaped the fole advantage which was derived from this assassination  assassinated by his nephew John of Habsbourg In Leopold  duke of Austria marched against the confederate cantons with an army of  twenty thousand men and endeavouring to force his way into the canton of  Schweitz at the streights of Morgarten received a total defeat from thirteen  hundred Swiss who were posted upon the mountains If we may believe contemporary historians the confederate  troops lost but fourteen men in this memorable engagement which insured their independence for ever This same year the three cantons entered into a perpetual alliance which was ratified at Brunnen and this alliance is the grand foundation of the Helvetic confederacy Such were the feeble beginnings of a league which has since become so formidable by the accession of ten more cantons and by the additional strength of its numerous allies and it is remarkable that Swisserland is the only country which on the  one side  has confined the limits of the German empire and on the  other  has set bounds to the French monarchy which it has never dared to transgress  Schweitzerland or as we term it Swisserland originally comprehended only the three cantons of Uri Schweitz and Underwalden but that name was afterwards extended to all Helvetia It derived that appellation either from the canton  of Schweitz as having particularly distinguished itself in the revolution of and also at the battle of Morgarten or from the Austrians calling all those who inhabited these mountainous parts by the general denomination of Schweitzers  Swisserland was the rock which the house of Austria split upon during more than a century Blinded with resentment against their former subjects and anxious to recover their lost domains in these parts the several dukes led on in person considerable armies to subdue a nation whose spirit was unconquerable and to get possession of a country which from its situation was easily defended by an handful of men against the most numerous troops Within the period above mentioned Austria neglected several opportunities of aggrandizing herself in other parts and slighting what was more feasible bent her whole efforts to obtain what in its  very nature was unattainable The consequence of this mistaken policy was a continued succession of defeats attended with a prodigious expence and the loss of their bravest troops until at length convinced of their error they totally relinquished an attempt which had cost them so much fruitless blood and treasure But although several emperors of that house occasionally made alliances with the Swiss cantons yet it was not till the treaty of Westphalia that their independence was fully and finally acknowledged by Ferdinand III and the whole empire  The government of these three cantons is entirely democratical and nearly the same The supreme power resides in the people at large who are in each of these cantons divided into several communities from which are chosen equally the councils of regency In the general assembly the Landamman and the principal magistrates are  elected and every burgher at the age of fourteen in the canton of Uri and of fifteen in Schweitz and Underwalden has a right to vote The councils of regency of Uri and Schweitz consist each of sixty members and reside at the capital burghs In this council the executive power is vested and from this body the principal magistrates are chosen Underwalden is divided into the inferior and superior valley and each of these divisions has its own peculiar government and administration Formerly the whole canton was under the same administration but the two districts separated upon some dispute and have since formed two distinct governments which have each their general assembly their Landamman and their council of regency but for the management of external affairs there is a joint council formed of the two divisions  These three cantons contain about eighty thousand souls and in case of  necessity could furnish above twenty thousand militia All the Catholic cantons enjoy considerable subsidies from France Every burgher of the age of fourteen receives six livres five shillings of our money annually the Landamman and the magistrates more in proportion The canton of Schweitz has had for some time a quarrel with France and accordingly withdrew its troops from that service but this year the matter has been accommodated and the king pays every male child of a burgher four livres annually reckoning from the time of his birth I cannot help thinking that the acceptance of these subsidies derogates in some measure from that spirit of absolute independence which the cantons of Swisserland profess and that it would be far more honourable to enter into an alliance with France upon terms of the most perfect equality than to receive from that kingdom paltry subsidies  which give an air of venality to their several treaties  The same kind of soil and the same sort of productions are common to the three cantons the whole country being rugged and mountainous consists chiefly of excellent pasture but raises little corn and has no vines One cannot but observe with astonishment to what a degree of fertility they have improved a land naturally the most barren and for which they fought with as much zeal and intrepidity as if they had been contending for the richest plains of Sicily or Asia Minor In these little democratical states sumptuary laws are not necessary for they scarcely know even in idea what luxury is Such indeed is the purity or as some perhaps would call it the austerity of morals which still prevails among these people as cannot easily be imagined by the inhabitants of great and opulent cities and I cannot reflect on that affectionate  patriotism which so strongly attaches them to their country without calling to mind that beautiful description of the Swiss peasant in Goldsmith's Traveller  " Dear is that shed to which his soul conforms  " And dear that hill which lifts him to the storms  " And as a child when scaring sounds molest  " Clings close and closer to the mother's breast  " So the loud torrent and the whirlwind's roar  " But bind him to his native mountains more"  Every step we now advance is treading as it were upon sacred ground as monuments continually occur of those memorable battles by which the Swiss rescued themselves from oppression and secured the enjoyment of their invaluable freedom I am now indeed in the very center of civil liberty would I could add of religious too but the church of Rome exclusively is established here and the people are in general bigotted superstitious and intolerant It must be acknowledged however  that this intolerant spirit is not wholly confined to the Catholic cantons for in those where the Protestants prevail Calvinism is alone admitted and thus a nation who prides herself upon her freedom denies the free exercise of religion to every other sect except that which predominates Is not this striking at the first principle and most valuable privilege of genuine liberty  Long as my letter already is I cannot forbear mentioning before I conclude it a peculiar custom observed in some of these democratical states every person who is chosen for a bailliage or any office in the least lucrative is obliged to pay a certain stipulated sum into the public fund This practice is attended with one ill consequence at least as the successful candidate is in some measure authorised to stretch his prerogatives in order to make the most of the profits of his charge Accordingly  it is a general remark that in the common bailliages the bailiffs appointed by the popular cantons are more apt to be guilty of exactions than those of the aristocratical  I am c  LETTER XII  St Gothard  August  SWISSERLAND is a most delightful country and merits the particular observation of the traveller as well for the diversity of the several governments as for the wonderful beauties of nature but the impositions of the innkeepers the difficulty of procuring horses and the exorbitant price one is obliged to pay for the hire of them are the taxes one must inevitably be subject to for the enjoyment of these its  delights  These little inconveniences  however should be borne with patience and goodhumour and I will not trouble you with any spienetic complaints of those unpleasant circumstances which all travellers must necessarily meet with  We quitted Altdorf after dinner having with difficulty hired two horses besides one for the baggage we procured however another upon the road so that what with riding and tying we got on very well About nine miles from Altdorf we began ascending The road winds continually along the steep sides of the mountains and the Reuss in many places entirely fills up the bottom of the valley which is very narrow that river sometimes appeared several hundred yards below us  here  rushing a considerable way through a forest of pines  there  falling down in cascades and losing itself in the valley We passed it several times over bridges of a single arch and beheld it tumbling under our  feet in channels which it had forced through the solid rock innumerable torrents roaring down the sides of the mountains which were sometimes bare sometimes finely wooded with here and there some fantastic beeches hanging on the sides of the precipice and half obscuring the river from our view The darkness and solitude of the forests the occasional liveliness and variety of the verdure immense fragments of rock blended with enormous masses of ice that had tumbled from the mountains above rocks of an astonishing heighth piled upon one another and shutting in the valesuch are the sublime and magnificent scenes with which this romantic country abounds and which enchanted us beyond expression  We set out this morning early from Wasen a small village where we passed the night and continued advancing for some way on a rugged ascent through the same wild and beautiful tract of  country which I have just mentioned We could scarce walk an hundred yards without crossing some of those torrents that precipitated with violence from the tops of the mountains in different forms the water clearer than chrystal The road exceedingly steep and craggy is chiefly paved in many places it is carried upon arches under a high mountain and overhangs a deep precipice the river roaring and foaming below This being one of the great passages into Italy we met a considerable number of packhorses laden with merchandise and as the road in particular parts is very narrow it required some dexterity in the horses to pass one another without jostling These roads hanging as they do over the precipice cannot fail of inspiring terror to those travellers who are unaccustomed to them and more particularly as the mules and horses have a singular method of going on They do not keep in the middle of the track  but continue crossing from the side of the mountain towards the edge of the precipice then turn aslant abruptly and thus form if I may so express myself a constant zigzag  Thus far the valley of St Gothard appeared to be well peopled and we passed through several villages situated towards the bottom and less narrow part of the valley the sides of the mountains were occasionally strewed thick with cottages covered with forests or enriched with pastures Still continuing to ascend the country a little beyond Wasen suddenly changed It now became more wild and perfectly desert there were no traces of any trees except here and there a stubbed pine the rocks were more bare craggy and impending not the least sign of any habitation and scarce a blade of grass to be seen We then came to a bridge thrown across a very deep chasm over the Reuss which here forms a  considerable cataract down the shagged sides of the mountain and over immense fragments of rock which it has undermined in its course This bridge is called  Teufelsbruck  or the devil's bridge the common people always attributing works of any difficulty to the devil As we stood upon the bridge admiring the cataract we were covered with a kind of drizzling rain the river throwing up the spray to a considerable heighth These are sublime scenes of horror of which those who have not been spectators can form no idea neither the powers of painting nor poetry can give an adequate image of them  Not far from this wonderful landscape the country still continuing solitary and desolate the road led us into a subterraneous passage of about eighty paces in length cut through a rock of granite which opened at the opposite entrance into the serene and cultivated  valley of Urseren the objects that presented themselves to us were a village backed by an high mountain on the sides of which was a wood of pines peasants at work in the fields cattle feeding in the meadows and the river which when we last saw it loudly dashed over rude fragments of rock in a continual cataract now flowed silently and smoothly along while the sun which had been hidden from us when we were in the deep valley here shone forth in its full splendor In general we had hitherto always found a gradual advance from extreme wildness to high cultivation but in the present instance the change was so abrupt and instantaneous that it seemed like a sudden enchantment  In this valley are four villages Urseren Hopital Realp and Zundorf forming a small republic under the protection of the canton of Uri The territory of this little commonwealth is  about nine miles in length and two in breadth and contains thirteen hundred souls The people elect in their general assembly their Talamman or chief as also some other magistrates and there is a permanent council of fifteen members who meet alternately in the different districts The inhabitants of this valley enjoy very great privileges but the republic is not absolutely independent for in civil causes an appeal lies from their courts of justice to Altdorf and in criminal ones although the trial is in the courts of the valley and before the judges of the country yet two deputies from the government of Uri are present at the decision and deliver in to the judges the opinion of the council of Altdorf  Notwithstanding the considerable elevation of this valley and the coldness of the air even at this season of the year it produces excellent pasture and some barley The only wood they  have is the small plantation of pines I just now mentioned rising behind the village of Urseren and which is preserved with uncommon care and reverence in some parts indeed along the banks of the Reuss there is here and there a small quantity of brushwood and stubbed willows but these do not supply the inhabitants with a thousandth part of the fuel necessary for consumption in this climate In the adjacent country there are several mines of chrystal of which a considerable quantity is exported to Milan as well from hence as from Altdorf The language of the country still continues a kind of SwissGerman but almost every person speaks Italian  The valley of Urseren is a small plain entirely surrounded on all sides by high and barren rocks the tops whereof are covered with snow This plain is commonly said to form the base of the mountain of St Gothard though the  latter is more properly an enormous mountain piled upon the shoulders of other mountains which rise rapidly from the lake of Lucerne Near the middle of this beautiful plain we turned to the left and again entered a valley filled with the ruins of broken mountains the Reuss bursting through it with a most rapid and vehement torrent on each side immense shattered blocks of granite of a beautiful greyish colour and of which the summits of these alps are composed confusedly piled together It is about three leagues from Urseren to this place and the ascent all the way as steep as a horse can well mount but the road considering the ruggedness of the rocks is not so incommodious as one might expect  We are now lodged at a house inhabited by two Italian friars from the convent of Capuchins at Milan who receive all strangers that pass through these inhospitable regions where there  is no other house for a considerable way One of the friars is absent so that I am in possession of his bedchamber it is a snug little room where a man may sleep very well without being an anchorite and which after the fatigues of our journey I enjoy with a satisfaction much too sensible to envy the luxury of a palace Our host has just given us a dinner consisting of delicious trout with which some of the lakes and the neighbouring torrents abound eggs and milk together with a desert composed of excellent butter and cheese both which were made in this dreary spot the pasture being peculiarly exquisite  Upon our arrival we were rejoiced to find a good fire the weather being so exceedingly cold that I who was only clad in a thin camlet coat came into the convent half frozen It is singular to find at the distance of only a day's journey the climate so different from what it was at Altdorf the air is absolutely  in a freezing state and I just now passed by a boy at work who was blowing his fingers to warm them If the cold be such in the midst of summer how intolerably piercing must it prove in December The snow begins to fall here the latter end of September and the lakes about this spot are frozen during nine months in the year  I am just returned from visiting the sources of the Tesin and the Reuss which rise within two miles of each other The former in the state I saw it flowed from under a mass of ice but the friar who accompanied us told me that when the ice is melted it is seen bursting from the rock from thence it takes its course towards the south is joined in its passage by several torrents traverses the lake of Locarno and part of the Milanese and at length unites with the Po The latter river issues from the lake Loacendro which is about two miles in circumference flows towards  the north into the lake of Lucerne and from thence throws itself into the Aar and the Rhine It was from the different courses of these two rivers that Mr de Boufflers said that upon the top of the St Gothard a man might spit into the Ocean and the Mediterranean These lakes of which kind there are a considerable number in these parts are equally deep in winter and summer and always preserve the same level They are probably formed by the melting of the snows with which the circumjacent mountains are covered although in several there is no appearance of their being supplied by any torrent For the snows thus melted force themselves channels in the rocks and flowing through subterraneous passages issue out at some distance and by this means the true sources of these great bodies of water lie concealed Within a day's journey is the source of the Rhine in the Grisons and about the distance of three leagues that of the  Rhone in the Furca which mountain we shall pass tomorrow We are still surrounded by very high rugged rocks and inaccessible glaciers so that our view is much confined and though I walked above a league towards Italy in hopes of having an extensive prospect of part of that delightful country yet I could see nothing but rocks precipices and torrents  I am at this instant near  According to Mr de Saussure the spot upon which the house of the Capuchin friars is built is French toises above the sea  seven thousand feet perpendicular above the level of the sea no inconsiderable heighth most certainly Nevertheless if I were to give credit to those who assert that this mountain is the highest point of Europe I should raise myself in idea above twice as high But as I have reason to think that this opinion is founded upon false calculations I will not flatter myself that I am more  exalted  above the rest of mankind than I really am Mikeli who measured the principal mountains of Swisserland but who is very inaccurate in his calculations considers this as the highest of all and he estimates its elevation above the sea as equal to feet But the truth is St Gothard so far from being of that elevation is by no means the highest mountain of Swisserland and there is probably not one mountain either in Europe Asia or Africa of that heighth According to general Pfiffer the most elevated part of the St Gothard rises above the sea feet an heighth considerably less than that of Aetna and of Teneriff and still more inferior to that of several in this great chain of alps which separate Italy from Swisserland  I am c  LETTER XIII  Munster in the Vallais  August  I Arrived here late yesterday evening and so fatigued that I could not have written a line for any consideration whatsoever but I am this morning quite refreshed with a comfortable sleep and in spirits to continue my journal I took leave of our host of St Gothard after having wished him a pleasant winter in that dreary situation and walked on alone for about two leagues down the vale of St Gothard Indeed I frequently quit my company and either go on before or stay behind that I may enjoy uninterrupted and with a sort of melancholy pleasure these sublime exhibitions of Nature in her most awful and tremendous forms I entered the valley of Urseren at Hopital and was again struck with the strong contrast between that cultivated  vale and the desolate country I had just quitted We passed through the small village of Zundorf and stopt at that of Realp to get some refreshment and bait our horses From thence we soon arrived at the extremity of the valley of Urseren where we began ascending a path so narrow steep and rugged that I could not forbear suspecting we had missed our way as it seemed almost impracticable for horses upon their arrival however I mounted being a little fatigued with my walk from St Gothard to Realp It was a single path up a steep mountain where an horse with some dexterity could just put one leg before the other and this path sometimes lay upon the edge of a precipice very craggy and stony where if my steed had happened to stumble we must both inevitably have perished But as I knew he had no more fancy than myself to take a roll down the precipice I had nothing to do but to  trust entirely to his discretion fling the bridle upon his mane and let him pick out his own road Nor had I any reason to repent of my confidence for in the bad and dangerous parts of the roads he never once tripped where it was smoother and safer indeed he knew he had a licence to be more careless  We came at length to a torrent which we passed by means of a plank that was thrown across after having got our horses over with some difficulty a little way farther we arrived at another deeper and more violent than the former over which there was no bridge not the least appearance of any track on the other side a considerable distance from any habitation and our guide unacquainted with the road After some observation however we discovered that the mountain had lately fallen down and had carried away the path leaving only a very faint narrow track that was  broken off on the side of the precipice along which my companions scrambled as well as they could upon their hands and knees While I was crossing on horseback the torrent which was filled with shattered fragments of rock I heard a scream and turning round saw one of our servants seized with a panic on the very edge of the precipice and vehemently exclaiming that he could neither get backwards or forwards Nevertheless with some assistance he got safe over declaring at the same time that he would take care never to put himself again in a similar situation We now regained a kind of path but so extremely difficult and dangerous that we thought it most prudent to dismount and leave the horses to make their way as well as they could With much difficulty and after having crossed several large drifts of ice and snow the torrents at the same time rumbling under our feet we reached by a very steep ascent the  summit of the valley A number of rugged and forked rocks piled one above another have occasioned it is said this chain to be called the Mount  Furca  The country immediately around us was more dreary and desolate than any we had yet seen not excepting even the valley of St Gothard all vegetation seemed to have ceased lower down the mountains were covered with herbage and sweetscented flowers near us but higher on the left lay a large body of ice from which issued a torrent probably one of the first sources of the Rhone rushing towards the Vallais In a word the several majestic objects that presented themselves to our view formed a scene inconceivably astonishing and sublime  From hence we descended scrambling down broken rocks and craggy precipices for a considerable way By this time I was sufficiently tired to be glad to sit down and take some refreshment  consisting of bread cheese and hard eggs the only provision we could procure at Realp We were seated by a stream of clear water gliding along the side of the mountain which indeed was so exceedingly steep that our humble repast would have rolled away from us if it not had been well supported In full view before us was the glacier of the Furca an immense mass of ice extending in the form of an amphitheatre between two rocks more shagged if possible than any of the neighbouring mountains it stretches from their feet fills up the chasm between them and reaches almost even with their summits The sun shone directly upon it and made it glisten like chrystal while the blue tints that were occasionally dispersed over the ice appeared inexpressibly beautiful The ice seemed to break in several parts as we heard some loud and deep cracks the torrent of the Rhone at the same time roaring beneath  That river is chiefly formed by this glacier the small torrent I mentioned above which bursts out from the upper body of ice is joined by several others then loses itself under the vast arch of ice that forms the bottom of the glacier of the Furca issues from thence considerably augmented and is the great and principal source from whence this famous river takes its rise The range of mountains on which we were sitting were spread over with brushwood and herbage and some cattle were feeding along the heighths a fine contrast to the sterility of the opposite chain which appeared for some extent nothing but bare and rugged rock except where it was covered with ice and frozen snow  After we had finished our banquet and reposed ourselves for a short time contemplating the singularity of the scene before us we descended close to the bottom of the glacier where we admired  the Rhone breaking forth with violence from the bed of ice near the tremendous fragments of a fallen rock We now followed the course of that river and proceeded down a mountain so exceedingly steep that the several parts of the road which was there paved winding along its sides were frequently parallel to each other The scenery of the vale which we now entered was of the same kind but more sublime if possible than that of St Gothard the Rhone foaming along with amazing rapidity as it falls in a continual cataract at the foot of some irregular alps of an immeasurable heighth Indeed this cataract is the most considerable of any we have yet seen except that of Schaffhausen We travelled through this vale above two leagues perpetually ascending or descending the rugged sides of rocks one moment close to the river and the next some hundred yards above it The grandeur of these scenes continued  with infinite variety for a considerable way and which added greatly to the magnificence and liveliness of the landscape I counted in less than a quarter of a mile twenty torrents at least which we crossed At first the rocks were either bare or studded here and there with some straggling pines but as we advanced they became more and more cloathed with wood and rich verdure still no traces of any habitation and we had now gone at least fifteen miles from our first quitting the valley of Urseren without having seen even a shed I was here so struck with the beauty of the forests through which we passed and the luxuriance of the pasture that I could not help expressing my astonishment that I saw no appearance of any habitation in these delightful spots I had scarce made the remark when four or five hamlets situated on the other side of the Rhone upon a beautiful declivity announced our approach  to the Vallais Not long afterwards we unexpectedly came to an opening which gave us an extensive view of that rich and fertile country with several villages here and there dispersed In this very spot some peasant either by a lucky hit of mere chance or the happy choice of instinctive taste has built his cottage Here we quitted the bad road and descended into the Vallais  We had proposed passing the night at Oberwald and I was very glad to arrive there after the fatigues of the day but upon enquiry we found it could supply us with no refreshment The master of a little hovel which was called an inn pointed to a large cheese and told us That was all the provision he had it was his bread his fish and his meat Meeting with no better reception at Obergestlen we continued on to Munster where we did not arrive till late here we found however an excellent inn for this country which  afforded us some good bread and even some meat but what was far more comfortable to me a quiet room and a clean bed  As we are going to quit this country immediately and propose returning into it by the Gemmi I will defer giving you any account of the government until I shall be better informed  I am c  LETTER XIV  Spital upon the Grimsel  August  THE Vallaisans are remarkably attached to their liberty Upon our quitting Munster this morning we walked on and joined company with a peasant with whom we had a long conversation The countryman asked us how we liked the country and pointing to the mountains said  "These  are our bulwarks and they are strong ones too Constantinople is not so strongly fortified"  This upper part of the Vallais I should imagine is not much frequented by travellers if we may judge from the curiosity of the people who all came out to gaze upon us and when they discovered that we were Englishmen they observed us with still more attention But what particularly surprised us was that the peasant abovementioned asked us  "How our war with the Americans went on"  It seemed indeed somewhat extraordinary that a common peasant of the Vallais should know there was such a place as Constantinople but it was more surprising still that he should ever have heard of the present contest between Great Britain and her American Colonies  After returning about a league the same way we came yesterday through this fertile and wellcultivated country  we left the plain and ascended the Grimsel one of those alps which separate the Vallais from the canton of Berne We were near four hours climbing up a steep and craggy road to the summit and we should have considered the attempt to gain it as scarcely possible to succeed had we not been encouraged by the experience of yesterday We crossed the several shades of vegetation in the valley and the lower parts of the mountain corn and rich meadows then forests of larch and pine next short grass together with several species of herbs that afford exquisite pasture to the cattle to these succeeded the various tribe of mosses and then bare rock and snow It would be curious to construct or at least to imagine a scale of vegetation according to the idea of a French writer whose name I have forgotten It would appear from thence that excessive cold and excessive heat are equally pernicious The tops of these  high mountains are barren and produce no plants and at certain heighths nothing but mosses will vegetate the same is observed in climates where the heat is intolerable as no other vegetable productions are seen in the burning sands of Africa The  mosses  then which support the cold better than other plants would form the first degree of a scale adjusted to determine how far vegetation accords with the  temperature  of the atmosphere The same family of plants as it supports also the heat much better than any other would occupy the last degree in the scale abovementioned Thus the two extremes touch one another surprisingly  From the top of the Grimsel we descended about two miles and arrived at a small plain or hollow in the midst of the mountains containing one solitary hovel and from this hovel I am now writing to you It made so bad  an appearance at first sight that we concluded we should get nothing to eat we were however very agreeably disappointed as we have found in this desart spot all the accommodations we could wish for except beds and these are the less necessary after the sound sleep we had last night Not to mention excellent cheese butter and milk our ordinary fare we got some good wine a small portion of kid and a boiled  marmote  which we have just devoured although at another time we should have revolted at the very idea The landlord is stationed in this forlorn region by the canton of Berne and he resides in it about four months the roads being almost impassable the remaining eight his business is to receive all travellers but upon condition however that they pay for their accommodations When he quits the place he leaves a certain quantity of cheese hard bread salted provision and  fuel in case any unfortunate wanderer should happen to come this way when the winter has set in and we observed long poles fixed on both sides of the track at small distances from each other in order to point out the path to passengers who may chance to pass this mountain after the snows have begun to fall Near the house upon the top of a small rock our host has made a kind of little garden by bringing some earth from the neighbouring pastures and this small bit of ground supplies him tolerably well with turnips cabbages and some other vegetables although on account of the heighth of the circumjacent mountains it does not long enjoy the warmth of the sun  Numerous herds of goats are kept during the summer months upon these mountains they are let out every morning to feed upon the rich pastures and return every evening before sunset to be milked and housed  It was a pleasing sight to observe them all marching homeward in the same herd and following one another down the broken precipices and along the rugged sides of the rocks their milk is delicious  This hovel besides the storehouses for the cheeses of which they make here a large quantity and of a most excellent sort contains only a small kitchen and one room in which we are now sitting We occupy nearly one side of it the other is taken up by our servants the landlord and his wife and half a dozen honest labourers the latter are eating their homely supper with all the relish that wellearned hunger can give and are enjoying a short respite from their toil with that noisy mirth which characterises the gaiety of this class of people  The sources of the river Aar are in these mountains Near our hovel are two lakes and farther on a larger  one from each of these flow cascades that fall into the Aar which rolls down in an impetuous torrent from the neighbouring glaciers I walked by the side of that river while dinner was getting ready searching for chrystals which are very common in these parts we picked up pieces of divers colours white black yellow and green Not far from hence are several very curious mines of chrystal I regretted much that I had not time to visit them These mountains certainly abound also in rich veins of gold and other metals a considerable quantity of golddust being found in the bed of the Aar and in the various torrents I can conceive nothing more fatal to the interests of Swisserland nor more repugnant to the liberties of the people than to have these mines of gold or silver traced and opened A sudden overflow of riches would effectually change and corrupt their manners and it is an incontestable  truth that the real power of a country not ambitious of making conquests is derived less from the wealth than from the industry of its subjects the happiness of a people as well as of an individual consisting in being contented  What a chaos of mountains are here heaped upon one another a dreary desolate but sublime appearance it looks like the ruins and wreck of a world  I am c  LETTER XV  Meyringen  August  I Found the cold upon the Grimsel more piercing than I had experienced upon the top of St Gothard and last night I suffered so much from it as scarcely to sleep one minute But then circumstances were somewhat different  in the two lodgings for at the Capuchin's I had a comfortable bed whereas last night I lay in the hayloft and could not get any covering I declare my blood has hardly yet recovered its circulation Take notice this is the th of August  We are now in the district of Hasli which makes a part of the canton of Berne it is enclosed on all sides by the mountains Grimsel Wetterhorn Shereckhorn Brunig c the highest alps of Swisserland and of these the Shereckhorn is the most elevated We passed through an uninterrupted chain of alps following the course of the Aar all around us for some way was wild and uninhabitable The whole surface of what little vale there was between the ranges of mountains was strewed thick with vast fragments of rock while those which still hung on the sides of the mountains seemed threatning to tumble upon our heads  the river the whole way thundering along in a continual fall This valley exhibits the same kind of scenes we have been long accustomed to except that the Aar rushes with more impetuous rage even than the Rhone or the Reuss and is frequently so swelled with the torrents it receives in its course as to ravage all the adjacent country we saw many marks of these terrible devastations We crossed it in several places in one of which the landscape was very much of the same dreary kind as that of the Devil's Bridge  See page  Near the small village of Hundeck about three leagues from Spital we had a glimpse through the trees of the Aar falling from a considerable heighth In order to gain a nearer view of it we climbed along the sides of a rock which happened very luckily to be well covered with moss otherwise from its steepness it would not have  been practicable I leaned against a tree that hung over the precipice and saw the river rushing all at once as if from a crevice of the rock and then spreading into a kind of semicircular expansion in its descent It fell with fury into a deep and narrow channel and then lost itself in the midst of the forest The river was very full and its perpendicular fall as far as I could judge by the eye might be about feet The scenery also was solemnly majestic the rocks on each side rising perpendicularly and totally bare except their tops which were crowned with pines  Great part of this land of Hasli is extremely fertile and well wooded we traversed in our way to Meyringen large forests of beech and pines the Aar roaring along the vale and the road which was as craggy and as rugged as usual incessantly ascending and descending We now passed through several  small villages which afforded us a pleasing sight after the desolated country we had so lately been accustomed to and came into a beautiful little vale of a most lively verdure and delightfully planted All here was calmness and repose neither rapid river nor roaring torrent to interrupt the unusual stillness and tranquillity of the scene This short interval of silence made us the more sensibly affected by the turbulence of the Aar and the loud clamour of the cataracts  We have now seen the three greatest rivers in Swisserland the Rhine excepted issuing from their respective sources and have traced them in all their violence through a tract of country in which Nature has exhibited some of the grandest and most august of her works But how impossible have I found it to convey to you an adequate idea of these her majestic variegated and astonishing scenes They must all of them upon paper necessarily appear much the same  yet in fact every river and cataract every rock mountain and precipice are respectively distinguished from each other by an infinite diversity of modifications and by all the possible forms of beauty or magnificence of sublimity or horror But these discriminating variations though too visibly marked to escape even the least observing eye elude every kind of representation and defy the strongest powers both of the pen and the pencil In a word you must not judge of the beauties of this romantic country from the faint sketches I have attempted to delineate for upon the whole they can no more convey to you a complete and perfect idea of these wonderful scenes than if I were to aim at giving you some notion of the pictures of Raphael and Corregio by telling you they are composed of paint and canvas  Meyringen is a large neat village being the capital burgh of this land of  Hasli a district which enjoys considerable privileges There is no bailiff appointed by the government of Berne over any part of this territory but the people are governed by their own magistrates the former however as well as the latter are obliged to take oaths of fidelity to the sovereign council of Berne All the authority which the bailiffs in the other parts of this canton enjoy is possessed in a great measure by the Landamman with this reserve however that he is subject to the inspection of the bailiff of Interlaken to whom he delivers in his accounts He resides here and is appointed by the sovereign council from among the inhabitants he continues in charge six years All the other magistrates except the judge and the secretary are elected by the people who assemble every four years These privileges are the more remarkable in an aristocracy like that of Berne where the council of two  hundred are in possession of sovereign and unlimited power In this district there are about men capable of bearing arms and about souls  The inhabitants are a very fine race of people the men in general remarkably strong lusty and well made the women tall and handsome The latter have an elegant manner of wearing their hair which is commonly of a beautiful colour it is parted from the top of the forehead from thence brought round and joined to the locks behind which either hang down their back in long tresses braided with ribband or are woven round the head in a simple plait But the other part of the dress does not in the least correspond with this elegance as their shapes naturally fine are spoiled by an absurd fashion of wearing their petticoats so high that they all appear as if they were roundshouldered and bigbellied  Meyringen is situated near the Aar  in a very romantic valley surrounded by meadows of a most luxuriant verdure sprinkled with cottages which are occasionally separated from each other by huge intervening stones and deep channels the remaining effects of storms and torrents Close to the village the Alpbach a torrent so called falls from the mountain Housli in two beautiful perpendicular cascades but with so much violence and in so large a body of water as to cause frequent inundations indeed the burgh itself has been in danger of being overwhelmed and destroyed by its repeated ravages against which however it is now protected by a wall of a considerable heighth and solidity Near this torrent is another fall of water that glides gently down the bare rock which is there more sloping and farther on a third glistened as it descended through a hanging grove of pines that feather the sides of the mountain  The following is the ordinary price of provisions throughout the mountainous parts of Swisserland I have reduced the price to the value of our money     s  d  Butcher's meat  per  pound    ½  BreadD  o    ½  ButterD  o    ¾  CheeseD  o    ½  SaltD  o    ½  Milk  per  quart    ½  Worst wine  per  D  o    ½  Pays de Vaud wine      By this you will perceive that in proportion bread is much dearer than the other articles and the reason is obvious for all these mountainous parts consist almost entirely of pasturages and produce little corn The peasants of Swisserland I mean those who inhabit the mountainous districts live chiefly upon milk and what results from it together with potatoes which are here much  cultivated According to the price of provisions in England the above list will appear exceedingly cheap but then it ought at the same time to be considered that money is very scarce in these parts Nor indeed is it so much necessary in a country where there is no luxury where all the peasantry have within themselves more than sufficient for their own consumption and are tolerably well provided with every necessary of life from their own little demesnes I had today a long conversation with one of the lads who came with us from Altdorf and takes care of the horses He lives upon the mountains of Uri and as their winter lasts near eight months of the year during some part of which time there can be little communication between the several cottages every family is of course obliged to lay in their provision for the whole winter His own it seems consists of seven persons and is provided with the  following stores seven cheeses each weighing twentyfive pounds an hundred and eight pounds of hard bread twentyfive baskets of potatoes each weighing about forty pounds seven goats and three cows one of which they kill The cows and horses if they keep any are fed with hay and the goats with the boughs of firs which in a scarcity of hay they give also to their other cattle During this dreary season the family are employed in making linen shirts c sufficient for their own use and for this purpose a small patch of the little piece of ground belonging to every cottage is generally sown with flax The cultivation of the latter has been much attended to and with increasing success in these mountainous parts of Swisserland  The houses as I observed to you before in my letters relating to Appenzel and Glaris are generally built of wood and it was a natural remark of one of  our servants as we passed through such a continued chain of rocks that as there was stone enough to build all the cottages in the country it was wonderful they should use nothing but wood for that purpose a remark that has been made by many travellers But it should seem that these wooden houses are much sooner constructed and are easily repaired that they are built in so solid and compact a manner the rooms small and the ceilings low as to be sufficiently warm even for so cold a climate The chief objection to them arises from the danger of fire as the flames must rage with great rapidity and communicate easily from one to the other This inconvenience however is in a great measure obviated by the method of building their cottages apart all their villages consisting of detached and scattered hamlets This observation however does not hold with respect to some of their largest burghs  and these must consequently be exposed to the ravages of this most dreadful of all calamities  I am c  LETTER XVI  Grindelwald  August  WE left Meyringen this morning crossed the Aar and mounted the Scheideck through a beautiful forest of beech poplars mountainash and pines in our way we passed by the Reichenbach a torrent celebrated for the beauty and impetuosity of its fall it glides for some way down the sides of the mountain then rushes perpendicularly into a deep gulph it has scooped for itself in a quarry of black marble and from thence after forming in its course several smaller cascades flows into the Aar  After ascending about three hours we refreshed ourselves and our horses in a delightful vale strewed with hamlets a sloping hill adorned with variegated verdure on one side vast impending rocks lifting their heads into the clouds on the other and a beautiful pyramidical mountain covered with snow rising before us As we were taking our repast we were suddenly startled by a noise like the sound of thunder we soon found that it was occasioned by the falling of a large body of snow from the top of the mountain which in its precipitate descent had very much the appearance of a torrent of water reduced almost into spray These  lavanges  as they are called are sometimes attended with the most fatal consequences for when they consist of enormous masses they destroy every thing in their course and there have been instances of their overwhelming even a whole village The one we saw  was very trifling but it was sufficient however to give us some idea of those which are more considerable The best preservative against the effects of these  lavanges  being the forests with which the alps of Swisserland so remarkably abound there is scarce a village if situated at the foot of a mountain but what is sheltered by one of them and the inhabitants preserve them with peculiar reverence as their common protector Thus what constitutes one of the principal beauties of the country affords also the greatest security to the people  The descent from hence to Grindelwald was long and tedious that village consisting of a number of cottages scattered over the plain and upon the rising hills exhibits a scene wonderfully agreeable and picturesque heightened at the same time by a view of the glacier The latter stretching from the summit of the mountain to the extremity  of the plain in a regular curve is beautifully skirted with wood and within a few paces of it on each side are fields of oats barley and rich meadowsbut I am going to anticipate the description I purpose to give you upon a nearer view and so good night  August  Dare I confess to you that I am somewhat disappointed and that a nearer view of the glacier has not sufficiently compensated for the fatigue and trouble of the expedition But I have promised to write from my own feelings and not to send you an account taken from the exaggerated descriptions of othersWe sallied out this morning full of impatience and expectation and arrived at the bottom of the glacier forming a vast majestic arch of ice from whence issued a most loud torrent of snowwater just melted This glacier is composed of an infinite  number of pyramids rising from the bed of ice which are more elevated towards the plain being from about to feet high and shortening as you ascend until they terminate in a broad surface broken into deep and wide clefts We were above two hours in mounting a very difficult path at the edge of the frozen region occasionally passing over the steep and craggy parts of rock almost perpendicular along the very sides of the precipice the danger of which makes me shudder even now This glacier as we were informed joins to a very extensive valley of ice about leagues in length and situated between two chains of elevated alps  After having ascended thus far we were stopped by almost impassable mountains and a rising hill of ice our guide who by the way was very stupid and did not seem to understand his profession assuring us at the same time that it was impossible to proceed any farther  Of this we were by no means convinced but not having any conductor with us who could lead us the way and not daring to explore these unknown regions by ourselves we descended with heavy hearts much chagrined that what we had seen though certainly a very curious and sublime sight did not come up to what we had been taught to expect and yet every one here as well as our guide assures us that no travellers have penetrated farther One reason I believe why this glacier is more particularly spoken of than others is that a very good view may be had of it without the trouble of ascending In that part between the mountains now occupied by this glacier there was formerly a road which communicated with the Vallais but is at present impassable and we were shewn a spot now covered with ice where some years ago there stood a small chapel  What peculiarly distinguishes the  glacier I have been mentioning from that of the  Furca  is that the latter lies amidst barren and craggy rocks in a most desolate dreary and uninhabited country whereas this joins to a very fertile plain and borders upon cultivation in other respects the  Furca  considered independently of its situation was a more striking object Not far from this glacier pines willows ash and oaks grow and come to perfection potatoes also together with beans beetroot and turnips are here produced and near the borders of the ice I gathered some strawberries and wild cherries and observed hazel nuts barberries and mulberry trees The valley of Grindelwald is extremely fertile it produces barley rye hay hemp and fruittrees in great abundance above head of large cattle and near of small are here fed  It has frequently been observed that on considerable elevations and more  particularly upon the glaciers one finds a difficulty of breathing a circumstance which has been imputed to the rarefaction of the air This however was so far from being confirmed by our own experience that I can venture to deny the fact For in all our expeditions upon the Swiss alps as well as in this of today upon the glacier neither I nor any of the company ever felt the least difficulty of breathing but on the contrary seemed to enjoy a more easy respiration we all appeared more free in our motions more light and not in the least sensible of any inconvenience except what arose from the piercing cold Indeed in mounting the sides of a steep and craggy rock the fatigue is so great that one is soon exhausted and obliged to stop occasionally in order to take breath but this is only the effect of violent exertion and so far from being caused by the elevation that we found the higher we ascended the more  we became refreshed It is certain that were this pretended difficulty of respiration produced by any subtlety of the air that cause would at least act uniformly and occasion the same effects on all considerable heighths But as we did not experience these effects we may fairly conclude it to be an error advanced hastily by some travellers and adopted by others who had never been out of the plain  I am c  LETTER XVII  Lauterbrunnen  August  THE road from Grindelwald to this place is singularly good and we met what to us is become a remarkable object a cart in our way as we have not seen any thing that moves upon wheels since we left Lucerne The country was  most supremely delightful beautiful hanging woods immense rocks deep precipices and violent torrents But I suppose you are by this time as much accustomed to rocks precipices and torrents as the readers of Fingal to blue mists and hollow winds  This vale of Lauterbrunnen is inclosed between two chains of high perpendicular alps the highest of which is called the  Jungfrauhorn  or the virgin's horn The etymology usually given of this word is that it takes its name of  virgin  from its top being inaccessible but this circumstance is by no means peculiar to this particular mountain and I much suspect that its appellation is derived from very high antiquity For it is a wellknown fact that mountains and promontories preserve their original names while towns and even tracts of country frequently change theirs with new inhabitants It is therefore from the former as well  as from the latter that the antiquarian should endeavour to trace the antiquity of any country It must however be confessed that if these etymologies are not in some measure corroborated by collateral historical evidence they are generally vague and uncertain more calculated to display the ingenuity of the etymologist than to throw any satisfactory light upon his researches In short it is only when history and etymology go hand in hand that they serve to strengthen and support each other It is thus that my very learned and worthy friend Mr Bryant in his late admirable performance has rendered his etymological enquiries subservient to and corroborated by history and with so much clearness as to carry the fullest conviction to his reader Were he now with me I am persuaded he would give me a much better etymology of the names of the Swiss mountains than those which I have hitherto met with  such as the  Jungfrauhorn  abovementioned or that of the  Gemmi  which is generally deduced from  Gemo  to groan because from its steepness the traveller groans as he ascends or from  Gemini  because there are two rocks in that chain of mountains which resemble each other Whereas it is more probable that the mountain in question was thus called long before the existence of the Latin language  We are now lodged at the house of the clergyman of Lauterbrunnen a little village or rather collection of cottages sprinkled like those of Grindelwald about the valley and accessible parts of the hills Near the house is the celebrated fall of the  Staubbach  which I am just returned from viewing This torrent precipitates perpendicularly from a considerable heighth and resolves itself into fine spray the greatest part of it falls clear of the overhanging mountain during its whole  descent but the remainder dashes about half way against a projection from the rock and flies off with inconceivable violence The clergyman measured a short time ago the perpendicular heighth of this fall and found it feet The sun shining full upon it formed towards the bottom of the fall a miniature rainbow extremely bright while I stood at some distance the rainbow assumed a semicircular figure as I approached the extreme points gradually coincided and formed a complete circle of the most lively and brilliant colours In order to have a still finer view I ventured nearer and nearer the circle at the same time becoming smaller and smaller and as I stood quite under the fall it suddenly disappeared When I looked up to the torrent in this situation it resembled a cloud of dust and from this circumstance indeed it takes its name  Staubbach  signifying in the German language a spring of dust  I paid for my curiosity by getting wet to the skin but then I had the  singular  satisfaction at the same time of seeing a rainbow in miniature no uncommon phaenomenon you know as it may be observed in any cascade upon which the sun shines directly in a certain position In the present instance however it was some consolation to me under my  dripping  circumstances that the object happened to be peculiarly striking We are this instant going to set out for the Lauterbrunnen glaciers  August  We rode yesterday morning to the extremity of the vale in which there are some points of view as fine as any I have yet seen in Swisserland In our way we had a glimpse of a superior fall of the Staubbach divided into two streams which afterwards uniting form the second perpendicular cascade just mentioned In this valley there  are several fountains of the clearest water that gush from the earth and numberless torrents which precipitate themselves from the mountains two in particular which fall from a greater heighth than even the Staubbach but as their descent is not so direct they are less beautiful  The ascent to these glaciers is not altogether so dangerous as that at Grindelwald though upon the whole it is more steep and more fatiguing After mounting above three hours we arrived at a small hut which in summer is inhabited by herdsmen who make there most excellent cheeses and have numerous herds of cows goats and swine Here we feasted upon cold chamois which our host had provided for us not to mention a delicious desert of admirable cream and cheese From hence we ascended still farther with considerable difficulty until we were surrounded by mountains  which we were told were absolutely impassable We wished to proceed but our host assured us we had but just time to return before night and that no strangers except four of our countrymen had ever gone so far Here then we sat down close to the ice and enjoyed a fine view of the glacier and mountains before us  One of these mountains the  Grosshorn  is pyramidical and covered with frozen snow another the  Breithorn  is conical of a stupendous heighth and crowned with an enormous mass of pure transparent ice from which the reflection of the sun's beams was inexpressibly beautiful The hollows between these mountains were filled with a large body of ice broken into the greatest variety of shapes imaginable and several torrents of which the Schmadibrunnen is the most considerable bursting from the snow and uniting in their course form the Gletcher a river which  flows through the vale of Lauterbrunnen receives the Staubbach and falls into the Aar  The whole scenery was exceedingly magnificent and exhibited a most curious and singular picture especially to one not accustomed to see ice and snow in the midst of summer bordering upon verdant groves and rich meadows But yet the ideas we had conceived of this wonderful landscape from the exaggerated descriptions of others have not been sufficiently answered nor was it much worth the trouble of climbing so far as we had almost as perfect a view of the glacier from the hut abovementioned Every thing in Swisserland has more than gratified our expectations except the  glaciers  and yet these are certainly the most sublime and the most interesting natural phaenomena in the whole country The truth is from the accounts we had heard and read of them our imaginations had been raised  too high and we were led to suppose that what we had seen in the Furca was much inferior in extent or magnitude to what we should see in these parts whereas in fact the latter was in all respects equal to whatever of the same kind we have since visited I am apt however to believe that our disappointment in some measure arose from the ignorance of our guides and indeed I have no doubt if it had been our good fortune to have been better conducted we might with some perseverance have penetrated farther into the upper regions of these mountains and have found our most sanguine expectations in no respect disappointed  The higher and more inaccessible parts of these alps are inhabited by the  bouquetin  and the  chamois  whose activity in scouring along the steep and craggy rocks and in leaping over the precipices is by all accounts scarcely conceivable  The blood of both these animals is of so hot a nature that the inhabitants of these mountains who are all of them subject to pleurisies take a few drops of it mixed with water as a remedy for that disorder The flesh of the chamois is much esteemed here and to us it appeared delicious seasoned as it was with hunger  These mountains are covered to a considerable heighth with a rich and delightful verdure and we saw upon their tops at some distance several little villages the access to which must have been almost as difficult as to these glaciers  Upon our return from our expedition our host feasted us with a most excellent supper among other articles there was the best ham I ever tasted The swine in these parts are uncommonly fat in summer they feed entirely upon the grass and wild herbs they find on the mountains and never taste any milk  The clergyman and his wife with whom we are lodged are very singular characters both of them immoderate talkers but each strongly marked with goodnature and benevolence and so very desirous to oblige and to furnish us with every possible convenience that their civility is absolutely embarrassing Indeed we were much concerned upon being informed that the good woman who is big with child had sat up all night to make bread and cakes and to prepare some other provision to carry with us in our excursion to the glacier and what was still more distressing she would wait upon us at supper notwithstanding all our entreaties to the contrary This good couple have several children and their circumstances cannot be very easy as the livings in the canton of Berne are extremely moderate and this is not one of the best From this consideration those travellers who are lodged in their  house always make them a handsome present as a recompence for the trouble they have been the occasion of giving them  I am now going to take a last look at the Staubbach before I bid farewell to our honest hosts and the vale of Lauterbrunnen  I am c  LETTER XVIII  Baths of Leuk  August  WHEN we were upon the Lauterbrunnen glaciers we were within three leagues of this place but the mountains being as we were informed impassable we were obliged to make a circuit of forty miles I have no objection however to these roundabout ways as by that means we have an opportunity of seeing more of the sublime scenery of this wonderful country  We had quitted the Aar at Meyringen and now joined it again about two leagues from Lauterbrunnen flowing through a fertile plain which lies between the two lakes of Brientz and Thun and issuing from the former We followed its course until it entered the lake of Thun so called from a town of that name situated upon its northwestern extremity This lake is about four leagues long and one broad and if we may judge from the steepness of the mountains with which it is bounded must be very deep the borders are richly variegated and present several fine points of view greatly heightened by some pyramidical rocks rising boldly from the edge of the water We coasted this lake through a delightful country to the small village of Leisingen mounted up to another called Aeschi from whence we looked down upon the whole lake of Thun and part of the lake of Brientz at a  small distance then entered the rich vale of Frutigen parallel to that of Lauterbrunnen and enjoyed for a considerable way a prospect of those glaciers we had visited the day before  This vale ends at the town of Frutigen from thence commences that of Kander with a river of the same name running through it towards the lake of Thun and bounded by an exceeding high mountain called Kandersteg In all these vales the rudeness and heighth of the mountains which almost shut in upon them contrasted with the beauty and fruitfulness of the plains which are always watered by some lively torrent form a thousand picturesque scenes ever changing and impossible to be described and they are still farther embellished by the number of ruined castles perched upon points seemingly inaccessible  The road continued good as far as the small village of Kandersteg and  from thence delicate travellers who do not chuse to mount a rugged ascent either on foot or on horseback are carried in a kind of armchair placed by means of poles upon men's shoulders We proceeded however on horseback having before rode up steeper and more difficult paths After having ascended above two hours we came to a single house not far from the top of the mountain where we got some refreshment here we saw nothing but immense rocks piled upon one another with no appearance of vegetation and the weather was exceedingly cold We then passed over a large drift of snow and came to a lake called the Dauben See about a league in circumference supplied by a considerable torrent from a neighbouring glacier This lake has no visible outlet but it evidently finds a passage under ground into the  Vallais  about six leagues off as that current ceases to flow when the lake is frozen  This chain of mountains which separates the canton of Berne from the Vallais is called the Gemmi from the point of which overlooking and almost overhanging the Vallais we had at once a most extensive prospect of that country and of the Savoy glaciers but what principally attracted our admiration was the  Mont Blanc  rising above the rest in the most stately and majestic form It is a conical mountain of stupendous heighth and seemed to have a glittering crown of pure ice upon its summit The mountain which we descended is in many places almost absolutely perpendicular and yet a horseroad has been cut out of the hard rock down this very formidable descent This road was begun in and finished in at the joint expence of the Vallais and the canton of Berne an astonishing work and proves that nothing is impracticable to human industry More than a  league of the hard rock has been blown up with gunpowder and a way formed which seems dangerous to those who are unused to mountainous countries or whose heads are apt to turn giddy It is about nine feet broad and quite hangs over the precipice in some parts for a considerable space it is a hollow way open only at one side the rock above projecting over it of the same breadth and in the same direction The appearance is peculiarly singular for as the road winds continually the scene also continually changes so that one moment we commanded an extensive view and the next were totally inclosed with barren rock From the beginning of the steep descent we all dismounted and the horses were left to themselves it was somewhat curious to see them picking out their way and frequently venturing to the very edge of the precipice to crop a straggling blade of grass  The descent from the top to the plain is about two leagues when you are arrived at the bottom and look up you cannot see the smallest traces of a road so that a stranger would hardly believe it possible that there really is one until convinced by his own experience  This place is famous for its hot medicinal springs and accordingly is much frequented by invalids of various kinds during this season of the year the patients either bathe or drink the waters As far as I can judge from the accounts which I have received concerning their warmth their analysis the method of using them and their efficacy in curing the gout rheumatism obstructions cutaneous disorders c they seem nearly to resemble those of Bath There are several springs of different warmth and of different qualities according to the most accurate experiments the Mercury in Reaumur's thermometer stands  at degrees when plunged into the warmest source and it is somewhat remarkable that a stream of cold water issues from the ground within a few yards of this lastmentioned spring  The accommodations for the company are very bad each person having for his own use a small apartment not more than a few feet square in which there is just room for a bed a table and two chairs The public diningroom is as you may suppose upon rather a larger scale as is also a kind of assemblyroom where the company who are very sociable meet occasionally Formerly the accommodations were tolerably good but unfortunately in a  lavange  fell with such impetuosity from one of the neighbouring glaciers upon the village as to overwhelm the greatest part of the houses and the baths and to destroy a considerable number of the inhabitants  The company here consisting of a large collection of persons from different  quarters of Swisserland are exceedingly affable and obliging insomuch that several of them have invited us to their respective houses at Berne Neuchatel c and this invitation was made with all that openness and unaffected frankness so peculiarly characteristic of the Swiss Accordingly we propose profiting of their hospitable offers fully persuaded that by so doing we shall give them an unfeigned pleasure and indeed it is not difficult to distinguish an unmeaning invitation of mere formal civility from one which is tendered with a real desire of being accepted We dined this morning at eleven the bell for supper is now ringing and it is scarce seven These are primitive hours but we have travelling appetites and provided we can but meet with refreshment it matters little at what hour or in what place  You are now probably drinking tea in your withdrawingroom from whence  you are enjoying that beautiful prospect I have so often admired The situation of this spot is far more romantic than that of Bath and the waters perhaps are full as efficacious yet this village contains only a few miserable houses while Bath is one of the finest towns in Europe I had a conversation today upon this topic among others with a very ingenious and wellinformed gentleman of this country I observed to him that considering the great credit and efficacy of these waters I could not forbear wondering that the chiefs of the republic had not thought the improvement of the accommodations an object worthy of their attention as the rendering them more convenient for the reception of invalids would undoubtedly be the means of drawing hither a great number of strangers and consequently could not fail of being highly beneficial to the country He assured me it had more than once been in their contemplation  but that there were some persons of great credit and authority who opposed it upon a principle similar to the policy of Lycurgus as they thought that a concourse of strangers would only serve to introduce luxury among the inhabitants and insensibly destroy that simplicity of manners for which the  Vallaisans  are so remarkably distinguished  How far the ignorance of a people contributes to their true felicity or how far a simplicity of manners may be corrupted by  national  improvement are questions which have been much agitated and will never be decided so long as it shall be held just reasoning to argue from the abuse to the use But I should think it will readily be allowed that superstition is ever the companion of ignorance and that a people who are both ignorant and superstitious must necessarily be benefited by an intercourse with nations more  improved and enlightened than themselves  Not far from hence a communication has been made between this place and the village of Alpen down a steep rock Where the mountain inclines ever so little towards a slope a footpath has been cut but in those parts where the rock is directly perpendicular ladders are placed not unlike those by which one goes down into mines and upon these the peasants ascend and descend with heavy burdens upon their shoulders I mention such circumstances as these not as being objects in themselves so remarkable perhaps as they are represented by some travellers but as they will give you a stronger idea of the extreme ruggedness and singularity of the country  I am c  LETTER XIX  Sion  August  IBEGIN now to feel myself much less constrained in conversation than I have lately been as the people in this part of the Vallais all talk a kind of French patois for this town being nearly the point where the German patois terminates and where the French begins the inhabitants consequently speak both languages Nothing is more curious or interesting to those who have entered into inquiries of this nature than to observe the gradations of language but as I own my ignorance in this branch of literature I can only mention the simple fact  We set out this morning at five and came down a very steep valley to Leuk a small town built upon an eminence near the Rhone that river is here very  rapid and if we may judge by the breadth of its channel often overflows its banks We crossed it at this place and continued for some way through a forest of firs till we again passed the river to Sider from thence along its banks to Sion the capital of this  dizain  and of the whole Vallais This tract of country called the Vallais stretches from east to west about an hundred miles and is divided into the upper and lower Vallais The former reaches from the eastern extremity to the river Morge below Sion and the latter from that river to St Gingol situated upon the lake of Geneva the whole containing about souls all Catholics  The upper district is sovereign of the lower and is divided into seven independent dizains or commonwealths six  The names of these six dizains are Coms Brieg Raren Visp Leuk and Sider  of which are democratical and that of Sion aristocratical The bishop of  Sion was formerly absolute sovereign over the greatest part of the Vallais at present his authority is extremely limited and he is little more than a kind of nominal prince However all the public acts are issued out in his name he has the power of pardoning criminals and the money is coined in his name and with the arms of the republic He is styled prince of the German empire and count or praefect of the Vallais  The seven dizains or communities abovementioned form conjointly with the bishop one republic and all the general affairs are regulated in an assembly called Landsrath or council of the country which meets twice every year at Sion This assembly consists of nine voices namely the bishop who has but one vote the landshauptmann or chief of the republic and each of the seven communities and all their resolutions are decided by the majority In this assembly the bishop presides  and the landshauptmann collects the votes The latter is chosen or confirmed by this assembly every two years and upon the death of the bishop the chapter of Sion choose four candidates from their own body and out of these the assembly nominates Each dizain although it has but one vote sends to this diet as many deputies as it pleases they generally consist of foura judge a banneret a captain and a lieutenant The judge and the lieutenant are appointed every two years the two others are for life The democratical dizains are exceedingly jealous of their liberties and very vigilant to prevent the deputies from gaining too great an influence Accordingly in each commonwealth before the meeting of the diet a general assembly of the people is summoned in which every one of the age of fourteen has a vote and instructions concerning all affairs of importance are by them given to their several deputies  which the latter are obliged strictly to follow By these means the several votes in the general diet do not depend upon the caprice or inclination of the deputies when assembled but the matter is first laid before the particular assemblies of each commonwealth and according to their decision the judge delivers in the vote  In all causes of a certain importance an appeal lies to this assembly in the last resort from the inferior courts of justice in the several dizains as well as from those of the bishop and of the landshauptmann Thus by the institution of this supreme council all the several communities in this country are firmly united and form in conjunction one body politic or republic for the general affairs of the nation at large In other cases each of the commonwealths is governed by its own particular laws and customs and the constitution of the six popular ones resembles in a great  measure the little democratical cantons of Swisserland  Both the upper and lower Vallais were formerly dependent upon the bishop of Sion but the inhabitants of the two districts united together in order to limit his power and having succeeded in the attempt they quarrelled among themselves for the superiority A bloody war ensued which terminated in by the total defeat of the lower Vallaisans Since that period they have continued subject to the others enjoying however some very considerable privileges The lower district is divided into six departments over which bailiffs are appointed by the general assembly  The republic of the Vallais is one of the allies of the thirteen cantons and besides this general alliance a particular treaty subsists between them and the seven Catholic cantons for the defence of their common religion They have entered likewise into treaties with France  and other powers with a reserve however in all of them respecting their general alliance with the thirteen cantons of Swisserland  The bishops of Sion had formerly a considerable influence over the political affairs of Swisserland and Matthew Schaner the cardinal bishop is famous in history for his great abilities his daring spirit of intrigue and his turbulent and restless ambition It was entirely owing to his representations and influence that the Swiss troops gave the only instance perhaps of infidelity to their public engagements of which they were ever guilty by breaking a treaty they had just concluded with Francis I When that monarch marched into Italy to attack the Milanese he endeavoured to gain over the Swiss who having taken the duke of Milan under their protection were the only obstacles to the progress of his arms After much hesitation they were at length prevailed  upon by the subsidies he offered to enter into a treaty with him but the alliance was no sooner concluded than the cardinal of Sion persuaded them to break it and continue the war The Swiss historians however record with triumph the patriotic conduct of two of their officers upon this occasion who remonstrating against this breach of faith drew off eight thousand of their troops and returning with them to their country in some measure retrieved the honour of their nation  The remainder of the army instigated by the plausible and artful eloquence of the cardinal attacked Francis I near Marignano which brought on one of the most furious and obstinate battles that was fought during the bloody wars of Italy Night alone put a stop to the engagement without separating the combatants both armies remaining blended together upon the field of battle Francis slept upon the carriage of a  cannon at no great distance from a battalion of the enemy At daybreak the Swiss renewed the charge with their usual courage and were received with equal bravery At length the intrepidity of the king and the desperate valour of the French rose superior to the furious and repeated attacks of the Swiss and the latter retired in good order to Milan leaving Francis in possession of the field of battle an advantage however which he gained by the loss of the bravest of his troops  The same cardinal of Sion who always entertained the most inveterate enmity to the French occasioned also by his sole intrigues the loss of the Milanese to Francis Lautrec in the year commanded a body of Swiss who formed the principal strength of his army On the other side the cardinal had obtained by his influence over his countrymen a secret levy of the  like number to join the army of the confederates and thus for the first time the Swiss were seen combating under opposite banners and ready to commit hostilities against each other Upon this occasion the cantons immediately dispatched messengers with peremptory orders for the Swiss in both armies to return to their country The cardinal bribed the messengers to conceal these orders from the Swiss in the service of the confederates and to deliver them only to those who were in the French army The latter obeyed accordingly and this desertion so weakened the army of Lautrec that he was no longer able to make head against the enemy in consequence of which Milan and the principal towns surrendered to the confederates  The inhabitants of this part of the Vallais are very much subject to  goiters  or large excrescences of flesh that grow  from the throat and often encrease to a most enormous size but what is more extraordinary idiocy also remarkably abounds among them I saw many instances of both kinds as I passed through this town of the latter some few were basking in the sun with their tongues out and their heads hanging down exhibiting the most affecting spectacle of intellectual imbecillity that can possibly be conceived The causes which produce a greater frequency of these phaenomena in this country than in any other is a curious question which very much excites my inquiry but I shall defer sending you my present opinion until I shall have gained all the farther information in my power to procure  The weather in this inclosed vale is exceedingly hot I am at this instant although it is late in the evening scarce able to bear the intolerable sultriness  This languid heat is probably one of the causes which occasion the inconceivable laziness and indolence of the inhabitants although something at the same time must be attributed to the richness of the soil which is so wonderfully fertile as almost to prevent labour and spontaneously produce the fruits of the earth And indeed the people assist nature very little we passed several vineyards in which we observed the vines were suffered to trail upon the ground whereas if at the expence of but little additional pains the branches had been properly raised and supported the owner would have been well rewarded by the superior quantity and quality of their produce  The dirt and nastiness of the common people is disgusting beyond all expression of which I have had some unpleasant proofs from entering into several houses as well in the town itself as on my way  to it I have just been holding a conversation upon this subject with my landlord who though much the nastiest fellow I ever saw was complaining of the uncleanliness of the people and seemed to assign that circumstance as one cause of the  goiters  This induced me to cast my eyes upon the person of my host with somewhat more attention in order to discover how it stood with himself in that respect and I was rather disappointed to find that he proved an exception to his own remark Let me not however be understood as insinuating that all the inhabitants in general are either goitrous idiots indolent or dirty like that traveller who asserted that all the women of a certain town were crooked redhaired and pitted with the smallpox because his landlady happened to be so Indeed I look upon national reflections in general to proceed from the narrowest and most illiberal turn of mind and I have  always been cautious not to judge of the physical or moral character of any people from a partial and superficial view But as to the singular prevalency among these people of the two natural defects I have mentioned it is a fact which I can venture to affirm both from my own experience and from various conversations I have had with several men of learning and observation of this country and with respect to the general dirtiness and indolence of the common people it is too notorious to escape the observation of the most careless traveller  Sion is situated near the Rhone at the foot of two insulated mountains that rise immediately from the plain upon these are several palaces belonging to the bishop particularly that called  May  ria  which is his principal residence and where the general assembly is held This town is very antient and was formerly the capital of the Seduni who inhabited  this part of the country in the time of Julius Caesar There are still remaining some inscriptions that prove its antiquity and among others that were so obliterated I was not able to decypher them I observed one which was more legible it is in honour of the emperor Augustus and was put up during his eleventh consulship In this inscription the town is called  Civitas Sedunorum  I am c  LETTER XX  St Maurice  August  AT Sion we parted with our horses and guides who had accompanied us from Altdorf and procured a piece of luxury to which we had been for some time unaccustomed I mean a coach But notwithstanding the concentrated  heat of the climate and the great sultriness of the air I prefer riding or walking as by that means one enjoys a more unobstructed view of the country and indeed the scenes are so beautiful and so perpetually changing that one's attention is called upon every moment by a variety of new objects that strongly demand admiration  Upon entering the lower Vallais I thought I perceived a greater appearance of industry than in the environs of Sion and I am informed that these people are not altogether so indolent as the latter  This imputation of indolence will not hold good with respect to all the inhabitants of the upper Vallais for in the eastern part of that district which we entered after having crossed the Furca the soil though far inferior in richness and fertility was much better cultivated and the people seemed more industrious than any we have yet seen in this country Some physical reasons may be assigned for this difference for there the weather is not so sultry the water is not unwholesome and the air is remarkably salutary Accordingly upon our first entering the Vallais we did not observe any of those goitrous persons or idiots which struck us so much in the midland parts  But as to dirt they by no means yield to those of Sion  We stopped at the village of Martinac which according to antiquarians was the ancient  Octodurum  It is said that near this place may be traced the site of Sergius Galba's camp one of Julius Caesar's lieutenants who was sent by that general to subdue the Veragri the Pantuates and the Seduni the antient inhabitants of these districts It seems evident indeed from Caesar's description in the third book of his commentaries that  Octodurum  could not be far from the present situation of Martinac placed as it is in a small plain encircled by high mountains and divided by the small river Dranse which falls not far from thence into the Rhone  I cannot however ascertain from my own observation whether there are in fact any traces still remaining of a Roman encampment nor could I get any information concerning it from the inhabitants so that what I have mentioned is only upon the faith of antiquarians and from the general position of the country  Near Martinac we were much pleased with the majestic appearance of the ruins of an old castle built upon the summit of a craggy rock and hanging over the torrent beneath it was formerly a castle belonging to the bishop of Sion and his principal residence The road lies from thence to St Maurice under a chain of rocks with the Rhone flowing at a small distance through the midst of a rich vale In our way we passed close to the  PisseVache  a waterfall that descends from the glacier above but which seems to burst from the middle of the rock I have  seen higher falls but none more beautiful There is a cleft in the rock at top on each side of this opening are shrubs and from the midst of these shrubs the torrent rushing in a vast body of water with amazing violence falls perpendicularly into the valley These torrents are my great delight but perhaps they recur a little too often in my letters to continue to be yours  Towards the extremity of the lower Vallais the two chains of mountains that bound this country approach towards the Rhone which almost entirely fills up the space between them In this spot is situated the town of St Maurice built almost totally upon the rock at the foot of a range of steep mountains at a small distance from the river Its antient appellation was  Agaunum  it takes that of St Maurice from an abbey erected in the beginning of the sixth century by Sigismond king of Burgundy in honour of a saint so called who it is pretended suffered  martyrdom in this place This saint was the leader of the famous Theban legion which consisting of above six thousand men was massacred as it is said by order of the emperor Maximian for not renouncing Christianity Various have been the disputes concerning the authenticity of this history for while some authors have treated it as a mere forgery others have contended for its being genuine with as much warmth and zeal as if the truth of Christianity depended upon the decision Without entering into the merits of the question I cannot but remark that the cause of Christianity has suffered more from weak and imprudent defenders than from the sharpest attacks of its most inveterate adversaries Indeed the question concerning the number and sufferings of the martyrs has occasioned much idle controversy for reduce the popular accounts of both as low as probability can reasonably carry them there will still remain  sufficient evidence of the wonderful constancy and calm resolution of those primitive victims and whether an hundred thousand or only fifty suffered for the cause of Christianity it will equally stand upon the same firm and immoveable foundation Nor is the inquiry more material concerning the motives that actuated their powerful and cruel adversaries It matters not whether Decius ordered the Christians to be persecuted because they had been favoured by his predecessor Philip or from his attachment to the Pagan rites whether Maximin persecuted them from political motives Dioclesian as introducing innovations in his government or whether they were favoured by Constantine from conviction or from policy For the truth of Christianity is in no respect affected either by the imprudence of its early professors if with any they were justly chargeable or the political reasons that influenced the conduct of those emperors  towards them But I am running into a digression so it will be best to stop here and bid you good night  August  A few Roman inscriptions and those chiefly sepulchral as also two antient columns defaced and plaistered together with the bridge over the Rhone which still subsists entire are the only visible marks remaining of the antiquity of this town This is the chief entrance into the Vallais and so wonderfully is this country fortified by nature that a handful of men might defend it against a very considerable army  Today we made an excursion into the canton of Berne in order to see the saltworks near Bex We crossed the Rhone over the antient and beautiful stonebridge I have just mentioned consisting of a single arch and esteemed by the most judicious and bestinformed  antiquarians to be undoubtedly Roman Half of this bridge belongs to the Vallais and the remainder to the canton of Berne From hence commences the bailliage of Aigle which reaches to the Pays de Vaud and was formerly when under the dominion of the house of Savoy comprised within that district at present it is classed under the German division of the canton although the inhabitants talk French  Upon our arrival at the saltsprings I put on a workman's jacket and went into the mountain about feet almost horizontally The gallery is about eight feet high and six broad and is as nicely hollowed as if it had been cut with a chissel it is by far the most commodious subterranean passage I ever entered The salt is procured from some springs which are found within a solid rock perforated at a great expence the richest source  yields twelve pound of salt in an hundred weight of water and the poorest but one pound in the same quantity Near these are several warm springs strongly impregnated with sulphur some of which contain also a mixture of salt and will flame if a lighted candle be put into the pipe through which they flow Not far from the richest of the saltsprings some pieces of rocksalt in cubical forms have been found but the quantity hitherto discovered is so very inconsiderable that no advantage arises from it  The water is conveyed by pipes to Bevieux where the salt is extracted If the whole quantity of the impregnated water which contains so small a proportion of salt were to be boiled immediately and at once the consumption of wood requisite for that purpose would amount to a great expence In order to save this cost they make use of what is called a  graduationhouse  constructed in the following mannerIt is a long building open at the sides  within  are ranged layers of faggots piled up to a considerable heighth The water in question is conveyed by pumps into reservoirs above from whence it falls down upon the faggots after having been resolved into rain by the current of air in filtering through these faggots it deposes a certain portion of its earthy and selenitical particles and is received at bottom into other reservoirs from whence it is pumped up again This process is repeated as often as is found necessary after which it is then boiled and the salt chrystalises upon the sides and at the bottom of the cauldron  These saltworks and those of Aigle are the only ones in Swisserland and they are of great consequence to this country as it must otherwise depend entirely upon foreign nations for a supply of so essential an article These works  are supposed to bring in jointly a neat yearly profit to government of above seventeen thousand pounds sterling and they furnish nearly one third of the whole annual consumption of the canton The remainder is procured chiefly from France which is obliged by treaty to provide the Swiss states with this commodity at a moderate price and indeed so high is the tax upon salt in that kingdom that even the French salt is sold two thirds cheaper in Swisserland than in many parts of France  At Paris where it is the dearest a pound of salt is sold for about sols or about sixpence of our money in some other parts of France for instance in Franche Comtè a pound costs only or sols but it is furnished to the Swiss at the rate of ½ sols  The ordinary price of common salt throughout the canton is at the rate of three halfpence per pound  In our excursion to these mines we passed through a most delightful country  richly variegated and abounding in hanging groves of Spanish chesnuts inexpressibly beautiful  I am c  LETTER XXI  Trient  August  I AM now writing to you from the little village of Trient in the Vallais on my way to the glaciers of Savoy From the mountain of the Furca its eastern boundary two vast ranges of alps enclose the Vallais the southern chain separates it from the Milanese Piedmont and part of Savoy the northern divides it from the canton of Berne These two chains in their various windings form several small valleys through which a number of torrents rush into the Rhone as it traverses the whole country from the  Furca to St Maurice A country thus entirely enclosed within high alps and consisting of plains elevated valleys and lofty mountains must necessarily exhibit a great variety of situations climates and productions Accordingly the Vallais presents to the curious traveller a quick succession of prospects as beautiful as they are diversified Numberless vineyards rich pasturegrounds covered with cattle corn flax fruittrees and wild forests and these occasionally bordered by naked rocks whose summits are crowned with everlasting snow and inaccessible glaciers This strong and striking contrast between the pastoral and the sublime the cultivated and the wild cannot but affect the mind of an observer with the most pleasing emotions  As to the productions of the Vallais they must evidently vary in different parts according to the great diversity of climates by which this country is so  peculiarly distinguished It supplies more than sufficient wine and corn for the interior consumption and indeed a considerable quantity of both are yearly exported the soil in the midland and lower parts being exceedingly rich and fertile In the plain where the heat is collected and confined between the mountains the harvest is so very forward that it has already for some time been carried in whereas in the more elevated parts barley is the only grain that can be cultivated with any success and the crop is seldom cut before November About Sion the fig the melon and all the other fruits of Italy ripen to perfection in consequence of this singular variety of climates I tasted in the same day what is usually to be had only in gradual succession strawberries cherries plumbs pears and grapes each of them the  natural  growth of the country  With respect to manufactures there  are none of any consequence and indeed the general ignorance of the people is no less remarkable than their indolence so that they may be considered in regard to knowledge and improvements as some centuries behind the Swiss who are certainly a very enlightened nation The peasants seldom endeavour to meliorate those lands where the soil is originally bad nor to make the most of those which are uncommonly fertile having few wants and being satisfied with the spontaneous gifts of nature they enjoy her blessings without much considering in what manner to improve them  The beauties and varieties of this country you will find amply and faithfully delineated in that elegant letter of the  Nouvelle Heloise  where St Preux relates his excursion into the upper Vallais As to the truth of the description he gives in the same letter of the manners of the people I can hardly be  supposed to be a competent judge from the little time I have passed among them But as far as I have had an opportunity to observe and inquire the picture although in some parts not entirely devoid of resemblance is upon the whole considerably heightened  Before I take leave of the Vallais you will probably expect that according to my promise I should send you some informations concerning the causes which are supposed to occasion or to contribute to render goitrous persons and idiots so remarkably common in many parts of this country I have indeed made all possible researches in order to gain some satisfactory intelligence upon so curious a subject but I have the mortification to add that the very faint lights I have been able to obtain have left me almost as much in the dark as I was before you must rest contented therefore with mere conjectures  I shall begin however with undoubted fact The Vallaisans are not all equally  subject to the above infirmities but those chiefly who live in or near the lower parts of the Vallais as about Sider Sion Martinac c The people in general are a robust and hardy race as well those who dwell in the places lastmentioned as those who inhabit the more mountainous parts of this country  It is a common notion that snowwater occasions goiters but I have some reason to think the contrary For I have been at several places where the inhabitants drink no other water than what they procure from those rivers and torrents which descend from the glaciers and yet are not subject to this malady indeed I have been assured though I will not venture to answer for the truth of the assertion that snowwater so far from being a cause is esteemed even a preventive The air of the mountains is also a strong preservative against them and goiters have been known to diminish upon elevated  situations whereas in the lower parts of the Vallais if this excrescence once begins to shew itself it always continues to encrease  This difference however may be occasioned by the different quality of the water as well as by the superior purity of the air  Some districts are more particularly remarkable for this disorder than others thus in a little village near Sion almost all the inhabitants are goitrous  From these facts it seems reasonable to conclude that goiters are derived from certain local circumstances and that several causes both physical and moral may jointly contribute to their production Among the physical bad water and bad air may perhaps be justly assigned but chiefly the former which near the particular districts abovementioned is stagnant and loaded with particles of  tufo  The torrents also which are formed by the melting of the snows dissolve this substance or similar ones in their passage and probably  this circumstance has given rise to the notion that snowwater simply in itself occasions these goiters but whereever it has that effect it is strongly impregnated with certain stony particles I was shewn several pools of these stagnant waters which I should have supposed no human being to have been capable of drinking Among the moral causes which may be supposed to concur in occasioning these guttural protuberances the inconceivable laziness and negligence of these people may be mentioned For they rarely take the least precaution to guard against or to remedy the ill effects of their unwholesome water indolently acquiescing in its consequences they use no sort of means either to prevent or remove them  The same causes which seem to produce the goiters probably operate in the case of idiots for wherever in this country the former abound the latter are also in great numbers Such indeed  is the nice and inexplicable connection between our bodies and our minds that the one ever sympathises with the other we see that the body suffers whenever the mind is deeply affected by any strong impression of melancholy and distress and in return that whenever the corporeal frame is impaired and shattered by long pain and sickness the understanding also is equally out of order Hence it is by no means an illgrounded conjecture that in the case before us the same causes which affect the body should also affect the mind or in other words that the same waters c which create obstructions and goiters should also occasion mental imbecillity and disarrangement But in conjunction with causes of a physical nature there is a moral one likewise to be taken into the account for the children of the common people are totally neglected by their parents and with no more education than the  meanest brutes are like those suffered to wallow in the dirt and to eat and drink whatever comes in their way  I saw several idiots with goiters but I do not mean to draw any certain conclusion from that circumstance For though in general they are the children of goitrous parents and have frequently those swellings themselves yet the contrary often happens and they are sometimes the offspring even of healthy parents whose other children are all properly organized So that it seems the causes abovementioned operate more or less upon some constitutions than upon others as indeed is observable in all epidemical disorders whatsoever  I was told by a physician of the Vallais that children are sometimes  born  with goiters and I saw several scarce ten years old who had very large ones These swellings when they encrease to a considerable magnitude check respiration and render those who have them exceedingly languid and indolent During my expedition through the Vallais I observed some of all proportions from the size of a walnut to the bigness of a peck loaf  The species of idiots I have mentioned above and who are deemed by many authors as peculiar to the Vallais are called  cretins  Among these I also observed a kind of sensible gradation namely from those who being totally deaf and dumb and incapable of helping themselves give no proof of their existence but the mere animal sensations to others who are a little more animated and possess some faint dawnings of reason    I was informed at Sion that the number both of goitrous persons and of idiots have considerably decreased within these few years and two reasons were assigned one is the laudable care which the magistrates have taken to dry up the stagnant waters in the neighbourhood and the other the custom which now generally prevails of sending the children to the mountains by which means they escape the bad effects of the unwholesome air and water  It is to be presumed that a people accustomed to see these excrescences daily  will not be at all shocked at their deformity but I do not find as some writers assert that they consider them as beauties I cannot believe that a Vallaisan poet would venture to address a copy of verses to his mistress in praise of her goiter To judge by the accounts of some travellers one might suppose that all these people without exception were gifted with the above appendage whereas in fact as I have before remarked the Vallaisans in general are a robust hardy race of people and all that with truth can be affirmed is that goitrous persons and idiots are more abundant here than perhaps in any other part of the globe  It has been asserted also by some that the people very much respect these idiots and even consider them as blessings from Heaven an assertion which is as strongly contradicted by others I made many inquiries in order to get at the truth of this matter Upon my questioning  some gentlemen of this country whom I met at the baths of Leuk they treated the notion as absurd and false but whether they spoke their real sentiments or were unwilling to confirm what they thought might lower their countrymen in the opinion of a stranger will admit perhaps of some doubt For I have since that time repeatedly enquired among the lower sort and am convinced that the common people esteem them as blessings They call them  "Souls of God without sin"  and there are many parents who prefer these idiotchildren to those whose understandings are perfect because as they are incapable of intentional criminality they consider them as more certain than the others of happiness in a future state Nor is this opinion entirely without some good effect as it disposes the parents to pay the greater attention to those unhappy beings who are incapable of taking care of themselves These  idiots are suffered to marry as well among themselves as with others and thus the breed is in some measure prevented from becoming extinct  Since I wrote the above letter I have met with an account of these Cretins in the "Recherches Philosophiques sur les Americains" The ingenious author compares them with the  blafards  of the isthmus of Darien a species of beings who resemble the white negroes He refers to a memoir written expressly upon these  Cretins  by the count of Mogiron and read to the Royal Society of Lyons I am sorry that I have not been able to procure this memoir because from the character given of it by the author of the  Recherches Philosophiques  it must contain some very curious remarks I shall here subjoin his account of the Cretins as being in many respects more ample than mine premising at the same time that it by no means appears these  Cretins  are universally  goitres  "On ne sauroit mieux comparer les Blafards quant a leurs facultés à leur degeneration et à leur état qu'aux  Cretins  qu'on voit en assez grand nombre dans le Valais et principalement à Sion capitale de ce pays ils sont sourds muets presque insensibles aux coups et portent des goîtres prodigieux qui leur descendent jusqu' à la ceinture ils sont ni furieux ni malfaisants quoiqu'absolument ineptes et incapables de penser ils n'ont qu'une sorte d'attrait assez violent pour leurs besoins physiques et s'abandonnent aux plaisirs de sens de toute espece sans y soupçonner aucune crime aucune indécence Les habitans du Vallais regardent ces Crètins comme les anges tutélaires des familles comme des saints on ne les contrarie jamais on les soigne avec assiduité on n'oublie rien pour les amuser et pour satisfaire leurs gouts et leurs appetits les enfants n'osent les insulter et les vieillards les respectent Ils ont la peau très livide et naissent Crètins c'estàdire aussi stupides aussi simples qu'il est possible de l'être les années n'apportent aucun changement à leur état d'abrutissement ils y persistent jasqu' à la mort et on ne connoit point de remede capable de les tirer de cet assoupissement de la raison et de cette defaillance du corps et de l'esprit Il y en a des deux sexes et on les honore également soit qu'ils soient hommes ou femmes Le respect qu'on porte à ces personnes atteintes du Cretinage est fondé sur leur innocence et leur foiblesse ils ne sauroient pécher parce qu'ils ne distinguent le vice de la vertu ils ne sauroient nuire parce qu'ils manquent de force de vaillance ou d'envie et c'est justement le cas des Blafards dont la stupidité est aussi grande que celle des Cretins"  In another part he says  "Mr De Maugiron attribue les causes du Cretinage des Vallaisans à la malprop eté à l'education aux chaleurs excessives des vallées aux eaux et aux goitres qui sont communs à tous les ensans de ce pays mais il y existe probablement une autre cause specifique que l'on sera plus à portée de connoitre quand on sera parvenu à obtenir la permission de dissequer un de ces Cretins"  See  Recherches Philosophiques sur les Americains c Par Mr De P Quatrieme Partie Section I    I am c  LETTER XXII  Geneva  August  UPON quitting Trient we went along some narrow vallies through forests of pines by the side of the torrent of Trient and soon afterwards entered  the valley of Orsina which led us to the small village of that name a little way  from Trient we entered the dutchy of Faucigny which belongs to the king of Sardinia Our road was very rugged till we arrived at the vale of Chamouny the great mountains and glaciers of Savoy rising majestically before us  There are five glaciers which extend almost to the plain of the vale of Chamouny and are separated by wild forests cornfields and rich meadows so that immense tracts of ice are blended with the highest cultivation and perpetually succeed to each other in the most singular and striking vicissitude All these several vallies of ice which lie chiefly in the hollows of the mountains and are some leagues in length unite together at the foot of Mont Blanc the highest mountain in Europe and probably of the antient world  According to the calculations of Mr De Luc by whose improvement of the barometer elevations are taken with a degree of accuracy before unattainable  the heighth of this mountain above the level of the sea is ⅓ French toises Mr de Saussure professor of natural philosophy at Geneva has made use of the above barometer in measuring the elevation of several very considerable mountains This great improvement of the barometer marks a distinguished aera in the history of natural philosophy as before it was rectified by that ingenious naturalist Mr de Luc its uncertainty was so great that there was no relying upon the mensurations which had been taken by that instrument  It was by this means that Mr de Luc found the altitude of the glacier of  Buet  and from thence he took geometrically the elevation of  Mont Blanc  above the Buet The labours of this celebrated naturalist and his rules for computing heighths by the barometer are to be found in his very valuable treatise "  Sur les Modifications de l' Atmosphère  " These rules are explained and his tables reduced to English measure by Dr Maskelyne R A and still more fully by Dr Horsley secretary to the Royal Society both these treatises are published in the Philosophical Transactions for the year  The accuracy of the barometrical measurements made by Mr de Luc was verified by Sir George Schuckborough in a number of ingenious experiments towards ascertaining the elevation of some of the mountains of Savoy a short time before I arrived at Geneva He followed Mr de Luc's method took the heighths of several mountains reciprocally by barometrical and geometrical observations and he perceived that the former coincided almost exactly with the latter  Having found the elevation of the summit of the  Mole  a neighbouring mountain above the surface of the lake of Geneva he took from thence the geometrical altitude of  Mont Blanc  During the course of these experiments he was enabled to correct some trifling errors that had crept into Mr de Luc's computations to improve still farther the discoveries of the latter and has facilitated the means of taking elevations by simplifying the tables and rules necessary for that purpose  The heighth of  Mont Blanc  according to Sir George Schuckborough is feet perpendicular above the level of the sea according to Mr de Luc ⅓ French toises which reduced to our measure gives feet if the proportion of the French to the English foot be nearly as to without considering the fraction The difference is only feet  See  Sir George Schuckborough's Observations made in Savoy      I am convinced from the situation of Mont Blanc from the heighths of the  mountains around it from its superior elevation above them and its being seen at a great distance from all sides that it is higher than any mountain in Swisserland which beyond a doubt is next to Mont Blanc the highest ground in Europe That it is more elevated than any part of Asia and Africa is an assertion that can only be made good by comparing the judicious calculations of modern travellers with the exaggerated accounts of former ones and by shewing that there is no mountain in those two quarters of the globe the altitude  whereof when accurately taken amounts to toises  General Pfiffer indeed computes the heighth of the  Schereckhorn  the most elevated of the alps in the canton of Berne as equal to toises above the level of the sea a calculation however which is probably somewhat exaggerated For although as I am informed his method of taking elevations is in itself exact yet as he does not correct the difference occasioned by the refractions of the atmosphere he consequently assigns too great an heighth Nevertheless as he accurately preserves the different proportions this exaggeration may be easily reduced to the true standard Probably the  Shereckhorn  will be found to be the highest mountain of the old world excepting  Mont Blanc    Perhaps in no instance has the imagination of man been more creative or more given to amplification than in ascertaining the heighths of mountains I have been considerably amused today with considering this article in Gruner's description of the Swiss glaciers In one of the chapters he has given the altitude of some of the most remarkable  mountains of the globe agreeably to the calculations of several famous geographers and travellers both antient and modern     Toises  According to Strabo the highest mountain of the antient world was about    According to Riccioli    According to Father Kircher who took the elevations of mountains by the uncertain method of measuring their shadows     Aetna is    The Pike of Teneriff    Mount Athos    Larissa in Egypt    But these several calculations are evidently so extravagant that their exaggeration cannot but strike the most common observer If we consult the more  In order to determine with absolute certainty that Mont Blanc is the highest point of the old world it would be necessary to estimate by the same mode of mensuration Mont Blanc the Schereckhorn the Pike of Teneriff the mountains of the Moon in Africa the Taurus and the Caucasus  The latter have long been deemed the highest mountains of Asia and some philosophers upon considering the great superiority which the eastern rivers have over the European both in depth and breadth have drawn from thence a presumptive argument that the Asiatic mountains are much more elevated than those of Europe But conjectures are now banished from natural philosophy and till some person of sufficient ability shall shew from undoubted calculations that the highest part of the Caucasus rises more than feet above the level of the sea  Mont Blanc  may be fairly considered as more elevated  N B Throughout the text I have made use of the French toise consisting of six French feet  modern and rational accounts  it appears that the Pike of Teneriff and Aetna have been frequently supposed to be the highest mountains of the globe The former is estimated by some natural philosophers to be toises above the level of the sea but according to Feuillée this elevation is  reduced to toises and this measurement too is probably somewhat beyond the truth whereas Aetna by the accurate computations of Mr De Saussure rises only  About English feet According to Sir George Schuckborough who says  "I have ventured to compute the heighth of this celebrated mountain from my own tables though from an observation of Mr De Saussure in which that gentleman obligingly communicated to me It will serve to shew that this volcano is by no means the highest mountain of the old world and that Vesuvius placed upon mount Aetna would not be equal to the heighth of Mont Blanc which I take to be the most elevated point in Europe Asia and Africa"  I am happy to find my conjectures corroborated by that ingenious and accurate observer     Feet  Heighth of Aetna according to Sir George    Of Vesuvius according to Mr De Saussure    Of both together    Heighth of Mont Blanc according to Sir George    Differenceor the heighth of Mont Blanc above that of Aetna and Vesuvius taken together    toises above the  sea So that from these observations as well as from those which have been made by other travellers whose skill may be depended upon it will appear that there are few mountains except those in America the elevation whereof reaches according to Condamine to above toises which are equal in heighth to  Mont Blanc  The access to Mont Blanc has been hitherto found impracticable About two months ago four inhabitants of Chamouny attempted to reach it and set out from that village at ten in the evening After above fourteen hours most violent fatigue employed in mounting rugged and dangerous ascents in crossing several vallies of ice and large plains of snow which was in some parts  so loose that they sunk in it down to the waist they found themselves upon the summit next to Mont Blanc At first sight it appeared scarce a league distant however they soon discovered that the clearness of the air the extraordinary whiteness of the snow and the heighth of that mountain made it seem nearer than it was in reality and they perceived with regret that it would require at least four hours more to arrive at it even supposing it were practicable But as the day was now far advanced and the vapours towards the summit of Mont Blanc began to gather into clouds they were obliged to return without having accomplished their enterprise They had no time to lose and as they were returning in great haste one of the party slipped down in attempting to leap over a chasm of ice He had in his hand a long pole spiked with iron which he had struck into the ice on the other side of the  opening and upon this he hung dreadfully suspended for a few moments until he was taken out by his companions The danger he had just escaped made such an impression upon him that he fainted away and continued for some time in that situation he was at length however brought to himself and though considerably bruised he sufficiently recovered to be able to go on They did not arrive at Chamouny till eight that evening after having passed two and twenty hours of inconceivable fatigue and being more than once in danger of losing their lives in those desolate regions but as some sort of recompence for so much danger and fatigue they have the satisfaction at least to boast of having approached nearer to Mont Blanc than any former adventurers  According to Sir George Schuckborough the summit to which they arrived is more than feet above the Mediterranean These persons however do not seem to have taken sufficient precautions for so perilous an enterprize for the expedition was not only hazardous to a great degree but it was also too fatiguing and too difficult to be accomplished within twentyfour hours They ought to have set out in the morning have taken furs with them and if possible have found some proper place in which to have passed the night If that could have been accomplished and if by any means they could have guarded themselves against the piercing cold they would have been sufficiently refreshed the next morning to have pursued their expedition and would not have found themselves after having advanced within four hours of Mont Blanc so fatigued and terrified as to be unable to proceed nor the day so far advanced that had they gone on they must have been overtaken by darkness and would probably have either fallen down one of the precipices or have perished with cold  See an account of this expedition in  Description des aspects du Mont Blanc  by Mr Bourrit    I am c  LETTER XXIII  Geneva  August  AUGUST d the day of our arrival at Chamouny we mounted by the side of the glacier of Bosson in order to see  les Murailles de glace  so called from their resemblance to walls they consist of large ranges of ice of prodigious thickness and solidity rising abruptly from their base and parallel to each other Some of these ranges appeared to us about an hundred and fifty feet high but if we may believe our  guides they are four hundred feet above their real base Near them were pyramids and cones of ice of all forms and sizes and shooting up to a very considerable heighth in the most beautiful and fantastic shapes imaginable From this glacier which we crossed without much difficulty we had a fine view of the vale of Chamouny  The th We had proposed sallying forth this morning very early in order to go to the valley of ice in the glacier of Montenvert and to penetrate as far  as the time would admit but the weather proving cloudy and likely to rain we deferred setting out till nine when appearances gave us the hope of its clearing up Accordingly we procured three excellent guides and ascended on horseback some part of the way over the mountain which leads to the glacier abovementioned we were then obliged to dismount and scrambled up the rest of the mountains chiefly covered with pines along a steep and rugged path called  "the road of the  chrystalhunters  "  From the summit of the Montenvert we descended a little to the edge of the glacier and made a refreshing meal upon some cold provision which we brought with us A large block of granite called  "  La pierre des Anglois  "  served us for a table and near us was a miserable hovel where those who make expeditions towards Mont Blanc frequently pass the night The scene around us was magnificent  and sublime numberless rocks rising boldly above the clouds some of whose tops were bare others covered with snow Many of these gradually diminishing towards their summits end in sharp points and from this circumstance they are called the  Needles  The names of the principal ones are Aiguille de Dreux Aiguille de Moine Aiguille de Tacul Aiguille de Charmeaux and those of the five glaciers that stretch towards the plain of Chamouny and unite at the foot of Mont Blanc are Tacona Boisson Montenvert Argentiere and Tour  Between these rocks the valley of ice stretches several leagues in length and is nearly a mile broad extending on one side towards Mont Blanc and on the other towards the plain of Chamouny  After we had sufficiently refreshed ourselves we prepared for our adventure across the ice We had each of us a long pole spiked with iron and in order to secure us as much as possible from slipping the guides fastened to  our shoes  crampons  consisting of a small bar of iron to which are fixed four small spikes of the same metal The difficulty of crossing these valleys of ice arises from the immense chasms They are produced by several causes but more particularly by the continual melting of the interior surface this frequently occasions a sinking of the ice and under such circumstances the whole mass is suddenly rent asunder in that particular place with a most violent explosion We rolled down large stones into several of them and the great length of time before they reached the bottom gave us some conception of their depth our guides assured us that in some places they are five hundred feet deep I can no otherwise convey to you an image of this immense body of ice consisting of continued irregular ridges and deep chasms than by resembling it to a raging sea that had been instantaneously frozen in the midst of a violent storm  We began our walk with great slowness and deliberation but we gradually gained more courage and confidence as we advanced and we soon found that we could safely pass along those parts where the ascent and descent were not very considerable much faster even than when walking at the rate of our common pace in other parts we leaped over the clefts and slid down the steeper descents as well as we could In one place where we descended and stepped across an opening upon a narrow ridge of ice scarce three inches broad we were obliged to tread with peculiar caution for on each side were chasms of a great depth We walked some paces sideways along this ridge stept across the chasm into a little hollow which the guides made on purpose for our feet and got up an ascent by means of small holes which we made with the spikes of our poles All this sounds terrible but at the time we  had none of us the least apprehensions of danger as the guides were exceedingly careful and took excellent precautions One of our servants had the courage to follow us without  crampons  and with no nails to his shoes which was certainly dangerous on account of the slipperiness of the leather when wetted He got along however surprisingly well though in some places we were alarmed lest he should slip upon the edge of one of those chasms for had that accident happened to any of us we must inevitably have been lost having neglected to provide ourselves with long ropes in case of such an event This man was probably the first person who ever ventured across the valley of ice without either  crampons  or nails to his shoes  We were now almost arrived at the other extremity when we were stopped by a chasm so broad that there was no possibility of passing it and we were  obliged to make a circuit of above a quarter of a mile in order to get round this vast opening This will give you some idea of the difficulty attending excursions over some of these glaciers and our guides informed us that when they hunt the  chamois  and the  marmottes  in these desolate regions these unavoidable circuits generally carry them six or seven miles about when they would have only two miles to go if they could proceed in a straight line A storm threatening us every moment we were obliged to hasten off the glacier as fast as possible for rain renders the ice exceedingly slippery and in case of a fog which generally accompanies a storm in these upper regions our situation would have been extremely dangerous And indeed we had no time to lose for the tempest began just as we had quitted the ice and soon became very violent attended with frequent flashes of lightning and loud peals of thunder which being reechoed within  the hollows of the mountains added greatly to the awful sublimity of the scene  We now descended a very steep precipice and for some way were obliged to crawl upon our hands and feet down a bare rock the storm at the same time roaring over us and rendering the rock extremely slippery we were by this time quite wet through but we got to the bottom however without much hurt Upon observing the immense extent of these glaciers I could not help remarking and it is a circumstance which many other travellers have observed before what a fund is here laid up for the supply of rivers and that the sources which give rise to the Rhine the Rhone and the Po will never fail I returned at length to the inn as dripping wet as if I had been plunged into water but perfectly satisfied with my expedition At Grindelwald and at Lauterbrunnen I had scarcely seen a glacier owing to the ignorance of the guides  and this induced me to suspect that all which had been said of them was greatly exaggerated  See pages and  But I now change my tone and am vexed that we were so pressed for time that we could not continue any longer at Chamouny for I should have had great pleasure in making different excursions towards Mont Blanc and in penetrating further into those desolate but magnificent regions  I cannot conceive any subject in natural history more curious than the formation and progress of these glaciers running far into fields of corn and rich pasture and lying without being melted in a situation where the sun has power sufficient to ripen the fruits of the field it is literally true that with one hand we could touch ice and with the other ripe corn But as this is a subject too important to be treated superficially and requires much accurate  observation and repeated experimental investigation I shall not attempt to enter into it I will beg leave however to trouble you with one observation which I made and it will serve to prove the occasional encrease and diminution of the glaciers contrary to the opinion of some philosophers who advance that they remain always the same and of others who assert that they are continually encreasing I think I may venture to assert that both these positions are equally untenable and it happens in this as in many other subjects that experience and truth are sacrificed to the supporting of a favourite hypothesis Indeed the fact seems to be that these glaciers in some years encrease considerably in extent while in others they recede and of this I am perfectly convinced from the following circumstances  The borders of the valley of ice of the glacier of Montenvert are mostly  skirted with trees towards its foot a vast arch of ice rises to near an hundred feet in heighth from under which the continued droppings from the melting of the ice and snow are collected together and form the Arveron which rushes forth with considerable force and in a large body of water As we approached the extremity of this arch we passed through a wood of firs those which stand at a little distance from the ice are about eighty feet high and are undoubtedly of a very great age Between these and the glacier the trees are of a later growth as is evident as well from their inferior size as from their texture and shape Others which resemble the latter have been overturned and enveloped in the ice in all these several trees respectively situated in the spots I have mentioned there seems to be a kind of regular gradation in their age from the largest size to those that lie prostrate  These facts fairly lead it should seem to the following conclusionsthat the glacier once extended as far as the row of tall firs that upon its retiring a number of trees have shot up in the very spots which it formerly occupied that within some years the glacier has again begun to advance and in its progress has overturned the trees of later date before they have had time to grow up to any considerable heighth  To these circumstances another fact may be added which appears to me convincing There are large stones of granite which are found only at a small distance from the extremities of the glacier These are vast fragments which have certainly fallen down from the mountains upon the ice have been carried on by the glacier in its encrease and have tumbled into the plain upon the melting or sinking of the ice which supported them These stones which the inhabitants call  Mareme  form a kind of border towards the foot of  the valley of ice and have been pushed forward by the glacier in its advances they extend even to the place occupied by the larger pines  As we proceeded from Chamouny the heighth of the mountains gradually diminished and the several valleys through which we passed were diversified in their figures and productions in a very agreeable manner These scenes to travellers who come from the more cultivated and less romantic parts of Swisserland must appear infinitely astonishing but with respect to ourselves who are lately arrived from the wildest country and the most barren rocks they made but little impression  We followed the course of the Arve which takes its rise from the glacier of Argentiere and rushes along in a sonorous torrent great part of the way Not far from Salenche we came to a descent where on our righthand was a small lake formed by a stream that bursts  from the rock and from this lake issues a current which falls into the Arve the situation was picturesque and the borders of the little lake skirted with wood were extremely pleasing and variegated From hence we descended into the plain which continues almost perfectly level to Geneva Salenche lies at the bottom of a broad valley which here contracts to a narrow pass Tradition says that this little plain was once a lake and indeed its form and the quality of the soil seem to justify tradition great part is laid waste by the unruly Arve which frequently overflows its banks and the rest is mostly covered with fruittrees  Not far from Magland we stopped to admire a beautiful fall of water called the cascade of Arpenas it is a torrent which rushes like the Staubbach from an impending rock When I saw it there was a considerable wind which drove the torrent soon after its leaving the rock at  least an hundred yards out of the perpendicular direction into an almost imperceptible spray I then beheld it trickling down the sides of the mountains in a thousand little streams which united at a ridge of the rock and from thence formed three cascades all different from each other The body of water was much more considerable than that of the Staubbach and the fall appeared to me altogether as high Between Magland and Cluse we took a guide to conduct us to the cave of  Baume  of which we had read a most magnificent description Though the ascent was not very high yet it was so steep that we were nearly an hour in reaching it we then scrambled along an ugly precipice from which we mounted a ladder and by the aid of the branches of a nuttree growing out of the rock at the mouth of the cave we pulled ourselves into a natural cavern more than a quarter of a mile in length and forming various  branches that led into lofty vaults and spacious openings A man of a very warm imagination might perhaps have discovered a magnificent chapel with a natural cupola an arsenal the ruins of a sumptuous palace c but as for my part I saw only a spacious cave covered with stalactites spars and petrifactions which shone beautifully enough but which I have seen in almost all the natural caverns I ever entered nor was this so transcendently beautiful as to answer the trouble it cost us to get into it  We passed the night at Cluse which is situated in a rich plain by the side of the Arve and the next morning came down the banks of that river to Bonneville the capital of the dutchy of Faucigny it stands also upon the Arve at the bottom of a chain of rocks which from this place diminish into hills All this part of Faucigny as also a small strip of the Chablais through  which we passed is a rich plain that produces wine and corn in great plenty but it is neither very populous nor perfectly well cultivated By the little village of Chene we entered into the territory of Geneva the sudden change from the poverty of the Savoyards to the neatness and ease of these people the populousness of the country the richness of its cultivation and the number of countryhouses scattered about the fields like ours in England were circumstances that affected me with the most pleasing admiration  I am c  LETTER XXIV  AS I propose visiting Geneva again in my way to the south of France I will defer sending you any account of that interesting town until my return  when as I intend passing a short time there I hope to get some farther information concerning the government c which I will not fail of communicating to you  We went from Geneva to Crassi a small village in the Pays de Vaud where we passed a day with one of our countrymen who has taken a house for the summer in that delightful spot In our way to Crassi we went through Versoi a little village in the French territories upon the lake of Geneva it goes by the name of  Choiseul's folly  Geneva having fallen under the displeasure of France that minister endeavouring to take advantage of the late troubles in laid a plan to ruin that town and to monopolise the whole trade of the lake Accordingly he fixed upon Versoi as a situation the most proper upon which to build a large town For this purpose he began by sinking a pier and making an harbour he constructed also  a frigate marked out the streets sent a considerable quantity of stone to build the houses ordered a garrison and erected huts for them in which they continued some time In short the borders of the lake for some way are strewed with all kinds of materials for building Nevertheless when the harbour was nearly finished and government had expended near three millions of livres the whole scheme was given up But the harbour the huts and the materials for building still remain disgraceful monuments of his illconcerted project  This  Pays de Vaud  is a country of which all historians and travellers who have had occasion to mention it speak with rapture particularly of that part which borders upon the lake of Geneva and indeed a more delightful country cannot well be imagined It is almost the whole way a gradual ascent from the edge of the lake richly laid out in vineyards  cornfields and luxuriant meadows and checkered with continued hamlets villages and towns the shores are generally of the cleanest gravel and the water is of so fine a transparency that you may see the bottom to a very considerable depth  We passed through Nyon which stands upon the edge of the lake and in the very point where it begins to widen It was formerly called  Colonia Equestris Novidunum  and as a proof of its antiquity several Roman inscriptions and other antient remains have been frequently dug up in the outskirts of the town Between St Pres and Morges the lake forms a beautiful bay these towns are situated upon the two points which jut out into the water the whole forming an amphitheatre gently rising to the Jura  All the possessions in this country which belonged to the duke of Savoy were wrested from him in the war which the canton of Berne declared  against him in in defence of Geneva and the same year the reformation was introduced From that period all the Pays de Vaud excepting the common bailliages of Grandson Orbe and a small portion of it which was ceded to Fribourg has been subject to Berne and makes part of that canton  Lausanne is built upon an ascent so steep that in some places it is with great difficulty the horses can draw up a carriage and footpassengers mount towards the upper part of the town by flights of steps which lean against the rock But these inconveniences are amply compensated by the sublimest views in nature the principal object is the lake of Geneva shaped like a bow the  arc  of which is formed by the Pays de Vaud and the  cord  by the coast of Chablais From Geneva to Villeneuve the two extremities of this lake may be an extent of above forty miles it varies  in its breadth the narrowest part is scarce three miles across and from Rolles to Thonon about fifteen It is not altogether so large as that of Constance but the scenery is far more grand and picturesque  The same year in which part of the Pays de Vaud was conquered from the house of Savoy the inhabitants of this town expelled the bishop and put themselves under the protection and sovereignty of the canton of Berne which confirmed all their privileges and added others At present Lausanne is governed by its own magistrates has its own courts of justice and what is very singular the citizens who inhabit the principal street have the privilege of pronouncing sentence in criminal causes The criminal is tried by the civil power if he is found and acknowledges himself guilty for his own confession is necessary otherwise he is put to the torture until  he confesses the burghers of this street assemble an advocate pleads in defence of the prisoner and another against him the court of justice give their opinion upon the point of law and the majority of the burghers in question determine the penalty If the punishment be capital there is strictly speaking no pardon except it be obtained within twentyfour hours from the sovereign council of Berne although it generally happens that eight days are granted for that purpose When the criminal is seized within the jurisdiction of the town the prosecution is tried and the burghers pronounce their sentence in the townhall and in this case there is no appeal But when he is taken within the district of the bailiff they assemble in his house and an appeal lies from their determination to Berne I have been the more particular in my enquiries concerning the mode of this criminal process from  the strong resemblance it bears in many respects to our trial by juries  Here is a celebrated academy for the students of this country as there is another at Berne for those of the German district professors in every science are appointed by government and there is a tolerable library for the use of the public The  manage  of Mr De Mezery is by far the best of a great number we have seen his skill in horsemanship and judicious manner of conveying his instructions deserves the highest encomiums His position and figure are firm and elegant and the horses which are reserved for his own riding are dressed with great taste and precision His method of disciplining them is mild because from his perfect knowledge of the nature of the animal he forces them to nothing which they are not well qualified to perform  I have had the good fortune several times to meet Tissot the celebrated physician  of this place well known in the literary world for his excellent writings upon several medical subjects His conversation is uncommonly interesting as besides his skill in his profession he is well versed in every branch of polite literature His private character is no less respectable than his public and he is as much esteemed for his great humanity as for his superior knowledge  Lausanne at present contains scarcely seven thousand inhabitants whereas a few years ago there were at least ten thousand and indeed the whole Pays de Vaud is much less peopled than it was during the last century This depopulation is owing to the encrease of luxury which prevents the gentry from entering into matrimonial engagements so generally as they were heretofore accustomed and induces numbers of them continually to emigrate in order to engage in foreign services For although the government of Berne is  certainly very mild and never lays on any additional taxes nor ever encroaches upon the privileges of their subjects yet as the gentry are totally excluded from any share in the administration of public affairs and commerce is reckoned degrading they have no other resource but in foreign services For this reason many of them are malecontents and would gladly exchange the mild republican form under which they live for a monarchical mode of government  The road from hence to Vevay is most delightful it lies along the sides of the mountains between continued ranges of beautiful vineyards The industry of the Swiss is no where more observable than in these parts the mountains in many places though naturally consisting of a bare steep rock are covered thick with vines The soil has been brought from other grounds and is supported by rows of little stone walls  raised from the edge of the lake to the heights above This district between Lausanne and Vevay is called  La Vaux  and contains the two pleasant little towns of Lutry and Cully as also the two villages of St Saphorin  In the church of St Saphorin is an antient Roman milestone found near that village with the following inscription  TI CLAVDIVS DRVSI F  CAES AVG GERM  PONT MAX TRIB POT VII  IMP XII P P COS IIII  F A  XXXVII  This inscription ascertains two circumstances which have been frequently called in question namely that the banks of the lake of Geneva which border this part of Swisserland were comprised within a Roman province even so early as the time of Claudius and also that  Aventicum  was the chief town of this part of Helvetia for the milestones always referred to the capital town of the province in which they were placed From St Saphorin to  Avenches  is exactly paces which answer to the th milestone  and Corsier it is entirely hilly rising abruptly  from the lake Above the vineyards are rich meadows and a continued forest  Vevay is the principal town of the bailliage of that name it is clean and wellbuilt stands at the foot of the mountains on the edge of the water and is one of the few towns in the canton of Berne which carries on any considerable trade The borders of this part of the lake are much more contrasted wild and picturesque than those about Geneva the alps of Savoy boldly jut out into the water and form a semicircular chain of mountains that enclose the lake except where they are divided by the Rhone which flows into it a few leagues from Vevay  Near Vevay is Clarens and opposite is Meillerie these are the scenes of Rousseau's Heloise Accordingly I hired that novel at a circulating library in Lausanne and continued all the way I passed examining the position of the  country and comparing it with the descriptions by that celebrated author Little things may be magnified but no pencil however animated can come up to the wonderful and sublime works of nature and even the warm colouring of Rousseau has not equalled the beauty of the situation I read with attention the principal parts of that admirable performance and now that I had the scenery as it were before my eyes I enjoyed in the perusal sensations which I had never felt before I dwelt more particularly and with infinite pleasure upon that fine letter in which St Preux relates his expedition to Meillerie across the lake I consider it as the masterpiece of the whole composition where the passions of love and despair are worked up almost to madness I observed the dark gloomy rocks of Meillerie and am convinced from the appearance of the opposite shore that had I been on the other side I could have  discovered the very place to which St Preux led his Julia and of which he gives so enchanting a description For although there are no traces of any history like that of Julia in these parts yet the scenery is strongly marked and I am satisfied that almost every spot which is mentioned in the letters actually exists in this romantic country For Rousseau himself passed some time at different parts on the borders of the lake and particularly at Meillerie about that period of his life when he may be supposed to have written his Heloise Open that performance read that letter and consider that part of it where St Preux points out the number of towns and villages the continued fertility and high cultivation of the  Pays de Vaud  and then contrasts it with the barren rocks of Chablais exhibiting here and there a few insulated towns which lie upon the very edge of the water you will see at once and in the same  point of view the fatal influence of despotism and the happy effects which arise from the most assured liberty under a mild and equitable government  I am c  Lausanne  Sept  LETTER XXV  Yverdun  Sept  THE chain of mountains called the  Jura  begins in the canton of Zuric from thence extends along the Rhine into the canton and bishopric of Basil stretches into the canton of Soleure and the principality of Neuchatel branches out towards the Pays de Vaud separates that country from Franche Comtè and Burgundy and continues beyond the frontiers of the Genevois as far as the Rhone In various parts this chain of mountains  forms numberless small vallies upon the heighths several of which are contained within the district of the Pays de Vaud  The valley of the lake of  Joux  is so called from a lake of that name upon the top of that part of the Jura called Mount Joux and which lies in the bailliage of Romain Motier It is about twelve miles by five of which a circuit of above twelve miles is occupied by two lakes close to each other and which formerly without doubt made but one the largest of these is called the lake of Joux This valley contains several small villages considerably peopled and the whole is beautifully checkered with fine forests rich meadows or flourishing fields of barley and oats Besides these two lakes a little farther is a third which lies in Franche Comtè One shore of the largest of these lakes is high rock covered with wood the opposite shore is a gentle ascent well cultivated and  producing grain backed by an abrupt ridge adorned with pines beech and oak The small lake close to it is in its shape more oval richly bordered with cornfields and cottages  Near the small village of Abbaye a rivulet gushes from the bottom of the rock and loses itself in the largest lake the water whereof has no apparent outlet but has certainly a subterraneous communication with the smaller lake On the opposite shore of the latter a stream issues out turns some mills and then is lost in a hollow gulph formed I suppose by the force of the current in a perpendicular rock About two miles farther on the other side of the mountain the river Orbe bursts forth and is probably produced by the lastmentioned stream here ingulphed  This little vale is very populous containing about three thousand inhabitants all of them remarkably industrious Some few make watches but  the greatest part are employed in polishing crystals granites marcasites c In the small village of Pont where we lodged all the inhabitants except one family bear the surname of Rochat a name which also runs through the whole village of Charboniere with the exception of only two families and is prevalent likewise in that of Abbaye the whole number of these Rochats amounts to above a thousand I enquired whether they took the appellation from any chief as the Scottish clans do or whether they were supposed to be descendents of the same family I was assured that the latter is the fact and that their ancestors came originally from France  In our ascent to this delightful vale and as we descended through a variety of hill valley wood and lawn we had a most extensive prospect comprehending great part of the Pays de Vaud the lake of Geneva with its mountainous  boundary and that of Neuchatel These two lakes appear from that high point of view to be nearly upon the same level  According to Mr de Luc the lake of Neuchatel is French feet above that of Geneva  with no considerable swell of the country intervening  We passed through the beautiful valley of Romain Motier to Orbe which according to antiquarians was the most antient town and once the most powerful of all Helvetia It was called  Urba  and was the capital of the  Pagus Urbigenus  no remains however exist at present of its antient splendour Some antique fortifications an old castle and a round tower are works probably of later and more turbulent times they were erected perhaps when this country was divided into a number of petty sovereignties  Orbe is an old town placed in a very romantic situation the country which  lies round it is chiefly planted with vines The town which is governed by its own magistrates is comprised within the bailliage of Echalens belonging to Berne and Fribourg these two cantons alternately send a bailiff who resides at Echalens and remains in office during five years When Berne appoints the bailiff an appeal lies from his decisions to the sovereign council of Fribourg as it does to the government of Berne when he is nominated by Fribourg By these means a great check is laid upon the exactions of the bailiff and I am informed that justice is no where more equally administered than in these common bailliages of the two cantons abovementioned  From Orbe we descended into the plain which stretches to the lake of Yverdun This plain was formerly covered as far as Entreroches three leagues from its present position and probably farther by that lake it is  now for a considerable part a great swamp We have taken up our lodgings at the baths of Yverdun within a quarter of a mile of the town these baths are strongly sulphureous and much frequented during the summer months  Yverdun is large airy and wellbuilt with stone like all the towns I have hitherto seen in the  Pays de Vaud  it stands not far from the lake in a small island formed by the two branches of the river Thiele Between the town and the lake there is a pleasant lawn extending to the water and planted with avenues of limetrees As one looks from this plain along the lake it is skirted with high land except on the opposite northern shore the middle part of which is quite flat and has much the appearance of a sea view  Yverdun carries on some trade has a few manufactures of muslin and linen and is one of the passages for the merchandise which is brought from Piedmont  to Germany Literature flourishes to a very great degree in this town which is celebrated also for its printingpress This press was established the beginning of the present century but was entirely neglected until some years ago when it was renewed with more success and with higher reputation than ever by  Felice  a Neapolitan of great learning and abilities  The lake of Yverdun or of Neuchatel stretches from south to north about twenty miles in length and in some places about five in breadth The southeast part of it where we now are is covered with countryhouses belonging chiefly to the inhabitants of Berne Today we dined with a gentleman of that town a member of the sovereign council whose acquaintance we made at the baths of Leuk his countryhouse stands close to the water at the village of Clendy commanding a pleasant prospect of the lake and of the adjacent country  It is somewhat extraordinary that the Swiss whose country abounds with situations inconceivably noble and picturesque and where Nature wantons in all the luxuriant variety of her most striking beauties that the Swiss should have adopted the dull and tasteless uniformity of the French gardens I have frequently observed in the midst of these romantic scenes a majestic forest sliced out into little regular allies and at the very borders of the fine lakes artificial pools of water edged with sunburnt parterres  I am c  LETTER XXVI  Neuchatel  Sept  WE skirted the west side of the lake through  Grandson  the principal town of a bailliage of that name belonging  to Berne and Fribourg and remarkable for the battle in which Charles the Bold duke of Burgundy was defeated by the Swiss in We entered the principality of Neuchatel about six miles from that town and passed through St Aubin Boudri Colombier c each of them pleasant villages upon the borders of the water The road runs along the side of the Jura with the lake lying below it through a country that resembled in some measure the district of La Vaux between Lausanne and Vevay the sides of the Jura are almost the whole way covered with vines supported in many parts by low stone walls The borders of the lake are more uniform than those of the lake of Geneva and do not rise into such high irregular and grotesque alps as the coast of Chablais Towards Grandson and St Aubin the country is more diversified with meadows and cornfields but nearer to  Neuchatel the upper parts of the mountains are cloathed with forest and the midland and lower parts entirely planted with vines  Between the lake and the Jura there are several rivers which burst out from the rock in very considerable streams and after turning several mills fall into the lake at a little distance from their source most of the rivers in this country are formed in the same manner The largest of these is that of La Serriere near a small village of the same name which we crossed today in our way to Colombier where we dined with a family whose acquaintance we made at the baths of Leuk We passed a very agreeable day with these amiable persons by whom we were received with that frankness and unaffected ease which characterises true politeness Indeed I cannot speak too highly of that genuine and unartful goodbreeding which in general distinguishes the Swiss gentry  After dinner some musicians of the country gave us the  Renz des vaches  that famous air which was forbidden to be played among the Swiss troops in the French service as it awakened in the soldiers such a longing recollection of their native country that it often produced in them a settled melancholy and occasioned frequent desertion The French call this species of patriotic regret  la maladie du pays  There is nothing I think peculiarly striking in this tune but as it seems to be composed of the most simple notes the powerful effect its melody has been found to have upon the Swiss soldiers in a foreign land is the less surprising Nothing indeed revives so lively a remembrance of former scenes as a piece of favourite music which we were accustomed to hear amidst our earliest and dearest connections upon such an occasion a long train of associated ideas will necessarily arise in the mind and if not totally  selfish melt it into tenderness It is observable that those who inhabit mountainous countries are more subject to this  maladie du pays  than others and no wonder as their habits of life are essentially different from what they find in other parts Accordingly the Scotch highlanders and the Biscayans as well as the Swiss when absent from their country are peculiarly apt to be affected with every thing that recalls it to their minds  Under the general name of Swisserland as understood by foreigners the principality of  Neuchatel  and  Vallengin  together with the  Grisons  the  Vallais  and the republic of  Geneva  are all comprised but strictly speaking these are only allies of the Swiss and do not form any part of that district which is called Swisserland by the natives The principality of Neuchatel and Vallengin are in alliance with the four neighbouring cantons Berne Lucerne Fribourg and  Soleure but besides this general confederacy the town of Neuchatel has a particular connection with the canton of Berne the inhabitants of the former being considered as comburghers or fellowcitizens with those of the lastmentioned canton The whole principality contains near forty thousand inhabitants of which there are three thousand in the capital it is there the governor resides and the general administration of public affairs is carried on  The town of Neuchatel is small It lies partly upon the little plain between the lake and the Jura and partly upon the declivity of that mountain in consequence of which situation some of its streets are rather steep At the commencement of the present century commerce was almost wholly a stranger here as the ridiculous pride of its being deemed degrading generally prevailed among them This senseless prejudice is now however wellnigh worn out and a  considerable trade is carried on The chief article of their exportation is wine produced from the neighbouring vineyards and much esteemed Several manufactures also of cotton and muslin have been established with success and within these few years the merchants of this town have raised large fortunes  I am c  LETTER XXVII  Neuchatel  Sept  I AM charmed with an expedition we have just been making to the summit of the Jura and I will give you a short account of it while the impression remains warm upon my mind  The principality of Neuchatel and Vallengin stretches from the lake to the limits of Franche Comtè containing in length from north to south about  twelve leagues and about six in its greatest breadth The principality of Neuchatel occupies all the plain together with the lower parts of the mountains while Vallengin is totally enclosed within the Jura Parallel chains of the Jura run from east to west and form in the most elevated parts several valleys The lower grounds of this chain are partly laid out in arableland but principally in vineyards the higher consists of a large tract of forest which in many parts has been cleared away and converted into considerable pasturelands intermixed with some fields of barley and oats But what particularly deserves the attention of every curious traveller in these valleys is the singular genius and industry of the very populous inhabitants  We passed through  Vallengin  the capital of the district of that name a small open burgh with a modern castle built on the ruins of an antient one  We then crossed the  Val de Ruz  which contains above twenty villages mostly situated on both sides at the foot of the mountains which terminate the valley the inhabitants in general are employed in agriculture some few excepted who follow occasionally the mechanical arts  We arrived about midday at La Chaux de Fond a large handsome village lying in a broad valley which borders upon Franche Comtè from thence we proceeded to Locle in the same valley through a continued range of pleasing cottages which skirt both sides of the road and such are scattered likewise all over the country As these two little towns or villages carry on the same commerce I shall comprehend them both under one common description  In the two burghs of La Chaux de Fond and Locle together with the districts belonging to them there may be in the whole about six thousand souls The genius and industry which so remarkably  distinguish these sequestered people is wonderful as in this retired corner of the world the mechanical arts flourish in their greatest perfection The inhabitants carry on an extensive commerce in lace stockings cutlery and other different kinds of merchandise of their own manufacture but watchmaking and every branch of clockwork are the articles in which they particularly and eminently excel They not only make every utensil employed in those arts but have invented several and all sorts of workmen necessary for the completion of that branch of business such as painters enamellers engravers gilders c are found in these villages where it is supposed that upon an average about forty thousand watches are yearly made The genius and industry indeed observable upon these mountains exhibit a scene uncommonly pleasing and no where perhaps except in Geneva  are there such a number of people apparently so much at their ease Accordingly as every individual is sure not only of obtaining a comfortable maintenance for himself but of soon placing his children also in a way of getting their own livelihood they all marry very early for women and children are employed in some of the branches of watchmaking and a child but of ten years old may earn tenpence a day by giving the last polish to steel instruments with the hand And as to the men there are few who do not get halfcrown a day and some nine shillings  Not many years ago the greatest part of these valleys was almost one continued forest but the wonderworking powers of industry have happily changed the scene into flourishing villages and fertile pastures Population has encreased of course and the following fact will give you some idea how much  it has encreasedFormerly the produce of the country was more than sufficient for the consumption of the inhabitants at present although it is considerably more cultivated they draw seveneighths of their provision from Franche Comtè And no wonder for besides the natural effect of their frequent and early marriages every stranger who brings a certificate of his good behaviour is at liberty to settle here and to carry on any trade he thinks proper without the least restriction Here no apprenticeship is necessary nothing is contraband and industry exerts herself untaxed  Besides those particular arts I have already mentioned some of the inhabitants of Locle and La Chaux de Fond are well skilled likewise in other branches of mechanical science and have invented several useful mathematical and astronomical instruments Among those who have eminently distinguished themselves  in this way is the famous Jaquet Droz who is now at Paris and whose son if I am rightly informed is at present in England exhibiting to the public several automatical figures of a very singular and surprising construction one of these plays upon the harpsichord another draws landscapes and what is still more extraordinary a third copies any word presented to it or writes down whatever the company shall please to dictate These are certainly wonderful inventions and seem to carry the powers of mechanism to a high pitch but still they are mere toys and surely an unworthy waste of great genius it is Swift making riddles How much more laudably and with equal success might the same talents and application have been employed in improving or adding to those instruments and apparatus which are necessary to assist and facilitate the purposes of the astronomer and natural philosopher  The origin of watchmaking in this part of Swisserland as related by Mr Osterwald antient banneret of Neuchatel the historiographer of these mountains is extremely curious and the truth of his account was confirmed to me by several artists both of Locle and La Chaux de Fond In one of the inhabitants brought with him from London a watch the first that had been seen in these parts which happening to be out of order he ventured to trust it in the hands of one Daniel John Richard of La Sagne Richard after examining the mechanism with great attention conceived himself capable and was determined to attempt to make a watch from the model before him but to this end he was destitute of every other assistance than the powers of his own native genius Accordingly he employed a whole year in inventing and in finishing the several instruments previously necessary for executing his purpose and in six months from that  period by the sole force of his own penetrating and persevering talents he produced a complete watch But his ambition and industry did not stop here besides applying himself successfully to the invention of several new instruments useful for the perfection of his work he took a journey to Geneva where he gained considerable information in the art He continued for some time the only man in these parts who could make a watch but business encreasing he took in and instructed several associates by whose assistance he was enabled to supply from his single shop all the demands of the neighbouring country Towards the beginning of the present century he removed to Locle where he died in leaving five sons who all of them followed their father's occupation From these the knowledge and practice of the art gradually spread itself till it at length became almost the universal business of  the inhabitants and the principal cause of the populousness of these mountains  But it is not merely in the articles abovementioned that the inventive genius of this mechanical people is observable it discovers itself upon all occasions where it can be applied to the purposes of their convenience and accommodations To give you an instance the rocks in most parts of the alps being exceedingly hard and solid the water can only make its way along their sides and rush down in perpetual torrents but the strata which compose the Jura being less firm and compact the rains and melted snow penetrate with impetuosity into the crevices and only discover themselves by breaking out into rivulets at the bottom of the mountains Now the peasants in order to avail themselves of this peculiarity have erected mills at a great expence and with inconceivable labour some yards under the rock which are  turned by those internal torrents of water that force their way through the crevices abovementioned And for this purpose the builders have constructed wheels in places where it seemed scarcely practicable and have invented new modes of scaffolding and a great variety of other ingenious contrivances in order to facilitate their work  The inhabitants of these several districts are exceedingly courteous and ready to give every assistance in their power to strangers who visit their country They are in general very well informed in several branches of knowledge and as they usually employ their leisure hours in reading there are circulating libraries to be found in many of the villages  Their houses are in general small but handsome and wellbuilt several of these which we entered were furnished with a degree of neatness and even elegance peculiarly striking Indeed luxury or what according to  the simplicity of manners is here called so the neverfailing attendant upon successful industry has made no inconsiderable progress in these mountains of which I had a curious proof from an inhabitant of Locle who seriously complained to me that it was now no uncommon circumstance for a master of a family to carry his wife to see a play at Besançon and that there were at this time at least ten hairdressers established at Locle whereas some few years ago there was but one to be found in the town and in its whole district  The rock which forms the base of the Jura is mostly composed of calcarious stone and perhaps there is no spot in Europe where one finds in so small a space so large a quantity of petrified shells and marine plants Near Locle I saw a whole ridge of hills that seemed to consist entirely of what are called  pierres arborisées  or stones with the impression of plants upon them  In returning we had a most sublime prospect of the lakes of Neuchatel Bienne and Morat with several high and rugged chains of alps rising one above another and stretching from the cantons of Berne and Fribourg as far as the Vallais and the mountains of Chablais  The most perfect ease and plenty reigns throughout these mountains and I scarcely saw one object of poverty during our expedition the natural effects of industry under a mild and equitable government It is of these vallies and of their inhabitants that Rousseau gives so enchanting a description in his letter to Mr D'Alembert to which I refer you  I am c  LETTER XXVIII  NEUCHATEL and Vallengin once formed two distinct principalities each having a separate and independent government but for some time past they have been united into one By the death  of the dutchess of Nemours in the sovereignty of Neuchatel and Vallengin became vacant to which as heir to the prince of Orange Frederic I king of Prussia amongst many others put in his claim and his right was acknowledged by the states of the country After his death it descended to his son Frederic William who transmitted it with his other dominions to the present monarch Frederic II  The constitution of Neuchatel is a limited monarchy The machine of this government is indeed actuated by such nice springs and its wheels are so exceedingly complicated that it is very difficult for a stranger to distinguish with any degree of accuracy the prerogatives of the sovereign and the franchises of the people particularly as some even of their most important privileges depend upon mutual acquiescence and immemorial custom and not upon any written laws I shall endeavour however as well as I am able to trace the principal features of this government the result  of my best enquiries during the short time I continued in the country and which I have since compared with all the printed accounts I have been able to collect  Upon the accession of Frederic I certain general articles were drawn up which in a great measure marked out the prerogatives of the prince and the liberties of the subject and these articles were signed and ratified by the king But besides these general articles which his present majesty upon his accession promised to preserve inviolate others were afterwards added at the pacification of and these put an end to the dispute between the sovereign and his subjects of this principality By this pacification the king not only renewed his assent to the  general  articles but also explained them wherever the tenor of them had been mistaken expressly confirming also several other privileges in favour of the people which had hitherto been equivocal or not duly observed  The most important of these general articles are  That the sovereign promises to  maintain the reformed religion as by law established and to tolerate no other sect except within the districts of  Landeron  and  Crossier  where the catholic religion is dominant  That no person but a native of the country although he may be naturalised is capable of holding any charge civil or military excepting that of governor who may be a foreigner and the same incapacity is extended even to natives who are in the service of any foreign prince whatsoever  That all the subjects have a right to enter into the service of any foreign power whatsoever provided that power whom they serve be not in actual war against the prince as sovereign of  Neuchatel  and that in case the sovereign be engaged in any war which no way concerns Neuchatel that state shall continue neuter except the Helvetic body take part in it  The latter clause of this article is not so clearly worded as it might have been from a delicacy I suppose of not expressly stipulating that the state of Neuchatel and Vallengin may oppose their sovereign by arms in case the Swiss should be engaged in any war against him It is evident however that they consider their connection with the Helvetic body as of superior obligation to that with their prince as sovereign of Neuchatel and Vallengin  The remarkable clause in question is as follows  Et qu'en outre et conformèment à des articles exprès et formels des franchises tant de la bourgeoisie de Neufchâtel que de celle de Vallengin cet Etat ne puisse étre engagé dans aucune guerre ni les sujets d'icelui obligés d'y marcher que ce ne soit pour la propre guerre du Prince c'est à dire pour la defence de l'Etat et pour les guerres que le Prince pourroit avoir en tant que souverain de Neufchâtel et non autrement en sorte que s'il avoit guerre pour raison de quelque autre Etat terres et seigneuries l'Etat de Neufchâtel ne soit point obligé d'y entrer mais en ce cas devra demeurer dans la neutralité à moins que tout le corps Helvetique en général n'y prit part et intérêt    That justice be equitably administered and for this purpose that the three estates of Neuchatel and Vallengin shall be assembled yearly  That the magistrates and officers of justice instead of holding their employments during pleasure shall enjoy them during their good behaviour And by the late pacification it was farther agreed that the prince is not himself the judge of their good behaviour but that in order to be deprived of their places they must be fully  convicted of malversation in office by certain judges at Neuchatel appointed for that purpose  That the sovereign shall take the accustomed oath upon his accession and promise to maintain all the rights liberties franchises and customs written or unwritten  It is remarkable that one of the most essential laws of this constitution depends entirely upon immemorial usage for that  "the sovereign shall be considered as resident only at Neuchatel"  is in the number of their unwritten laws Now it is this law in conjunction with the third article just cited that forms the whole basis of their civil liberty By the former the prince when absent can only address his subjects through his governor and the council of state and no subject can be tried out of the country or otherwise than by the judges appointed by the constitution by the latter should the king of Prussia be at war with all Germany the people of Neuchatel and Vallengin are by no means obliged to take up arms in his defence but individuals may even serve against him so  long as the powers whom they serve are not engaged in hostilities against their country  This right they still preserve notwithstanding all the attempts of the king of Prussia to deprive them of it The following anecdote I had from a gentleman of Neuchatel who was personally acquainted with the officer concerned  At the celebrated battle of Rosbach when the Prussian monarch gained a complete victory over the French army an officer in that service was taken prisoner He had behaved in so gallant a manner that the king struck with his valour asked him his name and his country the officer replying that he was of Neuchatel  "You are my subject" said that monarch "and yet you serve against me"  "I make use of the privilege" returned the officer "which I enjoy as a native of Neuchatel"  Soon after this the king sent a letter to his resident at Neuchatel in which he remonstrated against this right the letter was laid before the people The three communities of Neuchatel Landeron and Boudry positively refused to renounce this privilege that of Vallengin on the contrary issued out orders to all the officers of their district who were in the French army immediately to quit that service under pain of being deprived of their burghership The officers to a man remained firm in their refusal at length the subject of dispute was dropped and the recusants continued to hold unmolested their rights of burghership    Besides these general articles that comprehend the privileges of the people at  large there are others which the sovereign is equally bound to maintain relating to the town of Neuchatel and the district of Vallengin in particular  The prince confers nobility and nominates to the principal offices of state both civil and military except some few which the people have a right to appoint the  chatelains  and mayors who preside in the several courts of justice are also of his nomination His revenues are very moderate scarcely amounting to £ a year They arise from certain domains belonging to the sovereign from a small land tax and from the tythes of wine and corn which are mostly paid according to an antient and consequently very low valuation With regard to commerce no subject pays any duties either of importation or exportation except for foreign wines imported into the town of Neuchatel  During the absence of the prince he is represented by a governor of his own appointing who enjoys considerable honours indeed but his authority is very limited He convokes the three estates  presides in that assembly and has the casting vote in case of an equality of voices he has the power also in criminal cases of pardoning or of mitigating the sentence In his absence his place is supplied by the senior counsellor of state  The three estates of Neuchatel form the superior tribunal of this country and to them lies an appeal from the inferior courts of justice They are composed of twelve judges divided into three estates the  first  consists of the four senior counsellors of state who are noble the  second  of the four  chatelains  of Landeron Boudry Valde Travers and Thielle  The principality of Neuchatel is divided into a certain number of districts some of which are denominated  chatellanies  and others  mayoralties  The chiefs of the former are called  chatelains  and of the latter  mayors  in every other respect their office and their power is the same  and in case these cannot sit in person their place is supplied by the respective mayors of the principality of Neuchatel according to a certain order expressly regulated the  third  estate is composed of four counsellors of the town of Neuchatel The judges in the first  and second division hold their places for life those in the third are appointed annually This body ordinarily assembles every year in the month of May but is convoked extraordinarily upon particular occasions the town of Neuchatel is always the place of their meeting  These three estates are not as several authors have supposed the representatives of the people nor do they possess the legislative authority They are properly speaking the supreme court of judicature which receives all appeals and decides finally all causes even those relating to the sovereignty of the country a power which they exercised in the year upon the extinction of the direct line in the person of the dutchess of Nemours  It may be here worth remarking that the three estates decided the famous cause of the succession in as a process between the several claimants of the sovereignty But if in case of failure of claimants a new sovereign were to be chosen or a new form of government to be established this would no longer be considered as the affair of a court of judicature the question would come before the people assembled by means of their representatives the deputies of the four communities of Neuchatel Landeron Boudry and Vallengin    The council of state is invested with the ordinary administration of government has the superintendence of the general police and is entrusted with the execution of the laws The members are nominated by the sovereign and are not limited to any particular number The prince has no power but in conjunction with this council in which he is always considered as personally presiding and the power of the president is only to convoke the assembly to propose the subject of their consideration to collect the votes and to decide when the voices are equal Previous to the issuing of any ordinance by this council it is laid before a committee from the council of the town and the deputies of Vallengin who are to certify that it contains nothing contrary to law  The town of Neuchatel enjoys very considerable privileges it has the care of the police within its own district and is governed by its own magistracy consisting of a great and little council I will not trouble you with a detail of the several departments but I cannot omit mentioning the  ministraux  because the members  of that body form the third estate whenever it is proposed to frame new laws or to amend old ones The  ministraux  are a kind of committee from the council of the town and are entrusted with the administration of the police They consist of the two presidents of that council four masterburghers drawn from the little council and the  banneret  or guardian of the liberties of the people The six former are changed every two years the banneret is chosen by the general assembly of the citizens and continues in office six years  The legislative authority is divided in so complicated a manner that it would be difficult to say precisely where it absolutely resides perhaps the following account of the persons concerned and of the forms observed in enacting and in promulgating new laws may somewhat assist in clearing the difficulty  As soon as the causes are decided by the three estates assembled as I mentioned above in the month of May the four judges who form the third estate retire and their place is supplied by the four  ministraux  who represent the council  of the town The attorneygeneral then desires the members of the three estates to take into consideration whether it be necessary to frame any new laws or to make any amendments in the old ones If any new ordinance is proposed a declaration is drawn up and delivered to the council of state for their deliberation whether any thing therein is contrary to the prerogatives of the prince or to the interest of the public from thence it is communicated to the council of the town to be examined whether it infringes the privileges of the citizens of Neuchatel If it be adopted by the council of state and the council of the town it is proposed to the prince for his approbation or rejection in the former case it is again carried before the three estates and publicly read after which the governor or president declares the approbation of the sovereign It is then promulgated or as the expression is passed into a law by the three estates  Since the accession of the house of Brandenbourg the people of Vallengin are always consulted upon the framing of any new laws For this purpose the three  masterburghers of Vallengin examine whether it contains any thing inconsistent with the franchises of the people of that district and in that case they have the power of remonstrating to the governor in council  From all this detail it should seem that the legislative authority resides conjunctively in the prince the council of state and the town that the people of Vallengin have a kind of negative voice and that the three estates propose and promulgate the laws  Every year after the breakingup of the assembly of the three estates of Neuchatel the three estates of Vallengin as constituting the supreme court of judicature for that country meet at their capital burgh and decide finally on all appeals from the inferior courts of justice The  first  of these three estates consists of the same four noble counsellors of state who sit in the first of the three estates of Neuchatel four mayors of the county of Vallengin compose the  second  estate and four members of the court of justice of Vallengin nominated by the mayor of that burgh constitute the  third  The  governor or in his absence the senior counsellor presides as in those of Neuchatel These three estates of Vallengin have no interference in the framing of the laws but after they have been enacted or amended at Neuchatel in the manner abovementioned they are simply remitted to them by the sollicitorgeneral and publicly read before them  The people of the district of Vallengin assemble every three years in an open plain in order to elect their three  masterburghers  as they are styled who are respectively chosen from among the inhabitants of the burgh of Vallengin of the Val de Ruz and of the mountains The function of these masterburghers is to watch over the general interests of the people they are also in some cases their deputies and appear at Neuchatel in their name whenever they are summoned by the governor and council of state in relation to any affair which particularly concerns their country  The principality of Neuchatel is divided into a certain number of districts each of which has its criminal courts  of justice in the county of Vallengin there is but one for the whole district The spirit of their criminal laws is uncommonly mild and the penalty annexed to each transgression is marked out with a precision which leaves no part of the sentence to the arbitrary determination of the judges The great circumspection observed in their judicial proceedings may sometimes indeed favour the escape of the criminal but the very few instances which occur of atrocious crimes is a proof that this humane caution is no encouragement to transgressors as it is a strong presumption also of the general good morals of the people In a word and to speak of the temper of their legislation in the highest terms of encomium as well as with the strictest truth personal liberty is as tenderly and as securely protected by the laws of this country as by those of our own most invaluable constitution  When the criminal is arrested he is immediately brought to trial after which the sentence is read to him in prison The next morning the prisoner  is again brought before the judges assembled in the  open air  the whole former proceedings on the trial are read aloud and the judges once more deliver their opinion by these means time is given for farther deliberation In case the sentence is capital the governor is made acquainted without delay with the circumstances of the crime and if he does not remit or soften the punishment the sentence is immediately put in execution I am sorry to add that  torture  though seldom made use of is not absolutely abolished it is the only circumstance wanting to render their code of penal laws an admirable model of justice tempered with humanity  Such are the general outlines of this remarkable constitution by which the liberties of the people are as well and perhaps better secured than even in the democratical cantons for although the most despotic prince in Germany is sovereign his power is exceedingly limited Among those circumstances with which I was more particularly struck in this government I cannot but mention the very liberal encouragement given to  all strangers who choose to settle in the country They enjoy every possible privilege of trade and commerce and one can scarce meet with any state where fewer essential distinctions are made between these and the natives I have already observed to you the good effects which this enlarged policy has had within the present century on the population of Neuchatel and Vallengin whereas a narrower and more contracted principle in some of the neighbouring Swiss cantons unwisely withholding them from giving encouragement to the settling of strangers among them has occasioned and continues to occasion a very manifest decrease of their people  I am c  LETTER XXIX  Morat  Sept  IN our way to Avenches we crossed the river Thiele which issues from the lake of Neuchatel and discharges itself into that of Bienne this river separates the principality of Neuchatel  from the canton of Berne Thiele is a district of the province of Neuchatel and contains several villages in a tract of level country which produces wine corn and fruit a spirit of industry prevails among the inhabitants particularly those of the villages of Thiele and St Blaise  Morat is a bailliage belonging to Berne and Fribourg the reformation was introduced here in by the majority of voices in presence of the deputies of Berne and Fribourg The free spirit of the Swiss governments is in no instance more remarkably apparent than by the mode they observed in embracing or rejecting the reformation as in many other towns besides Morat the question was fairly put to the vote and the minority generally submitted to the decision of the greater number with perfect acquiescence  This town stands upon the edge of a small lake about six miles long and two broad in the midst of a wellcultivated country The lakes of Morat and Neuchatel are parallel to each other and separated only by a small hill the former  is the highest for it discharges itself by means of the river Broye into the latter According to Mr de Luc the lake of Morat is fifteen French feet about sixteen of our measure above the level of that of Neuchatel Both these lakes as well as that of Bienne formerly extended much farther than their present limits and I have little doubt from the position of the country that they were once united  Morat is celebrated for the obstinate siege it sustained in against Charles the Bold duke of Burgundy which was followed by the battle of Morat in this famous engagement the duke was routed and his whole army almost entirely destroyed by the confederate Swiss troops Not far from the town and close to the high road there still remains a monument of this victory it is a square building filled with the bones of the soldiers belonging to the duke of Burgundy's army who were slain at the siege and in the battle and indeed by the quantity of these bones it appears that the number of the slaughtered was considerable Over the building are several inscriptions  in Latin and German relative to that memorable victory I transcribed the following on account of its elegant conciseness  Deo Opt Max  Caroli Inclyti et Fortissimi  Burgundiae Ducis Exercitus  Muratum obsidens ab Helvetiis  Caesus hoc sui Monumentum reliquit  Ann  This war which Charles the Bold carried on against the Swiss with a temerity peculiar to himself forms a memorable aera in the history of this country and was attended with some very extraordinary circumstances From the time of the famous revolution in which gave rise to the Helvetic confederacy to the end of the following century the Swiss republics stripped the house of Austria of all their territories that lay within Swisserland and continued in possession of them notwithstanding the various attempts made by the different dukes to recover their lost domains Among these Sigismond the Simple archduke of Austria of the branch  of Tyrol was more particularly engaged in perpetual hostilities with the Swiss cantons and their allies for his hereditary dominions in Suabia and Alsace bordered upon Swisserland and induced him to enter more frequently into these quarrels than the other branch of that house which was in possession of the imperial throne  In the course of these hostilities Sigismond was compelled to cede a considerable part of his territories to the Swiss republics particularly the rich country of Thurgaw was yielded to the seven cantons which at that period composed the Helvetic league  Berne obtained the coregency of Thurgaw at the peace of Araw  These repeated losses and the humiliating conditions of peace he was constrained to accept in filled him with resentment and he endeavoured to engage some of the neighbouring powers to join with him in a confederacy against the Swiss cantons For this purpose he first applied to Louis XI king of France but not succeeding he addressed himself to Charles the Bold duke of Burgundy  That prince having succeeded to the possession of Franche Comtè Burgundy Artois and Flanders together with the greatest part of the now United Provinces his revenues were as ample and his territories as extensive as those of the most potent sovereign of his time Magnificent impetuous and enterprising he set no bounds to his restless ambition nor neglected any opportunity of enlarging his domains and aggrandising his power He had formed the plan of erecting his dominions into a monarchy and had already in imagination appropriated to himself Lorraine and part of Swisserland which he proposed to conquer and annex to his hereditary territories  A prince of such a character could not but be welldisposed to listen to any overtures or to undertake any war that might advance his projected schemes Accordingly Charles received with eagerness the propositions which Sigismond made him flattered him with the hopes of bestowing upon him in marriage his daughter Mary heiress of his extensive dominions and prevailed upon that credulous  prince to surrender to him Sundgaw Alsace Brisgaw and the four Foresttowns as a pledge for the security of eighty thousand florins upon the repayment of which sum the provinces in question were to be restored  By this treaty Sigismond acquired a sum of money to assist him in his preparations against the Swiss protected as he thought his hereditary dominions from their enterprises and secured a powerful ally against the antient enemies of his family The reverse however proved to be the event for by a strange fatality this treaty which was to cement the union of the two princes and to engage them to attack conjointly that formidable people served only to divide the contracting parties and occasioned the first perpetual alliance between the Swiss cantons and a prince of the house of Austria  Charles upon the conclusion of this alliance informed the Swiss cantons that he had taken Sigismond under his protection and would defend him to the utmost of his power Meanwhile the bailiffs whom he placed over his newacquired  territories in Alsace oppressed the people laid embargoes upon the commerce of Mulhausen a small town confederated with the cantons and withheld the rents of the estates belonging to the Swiss in Sundgaw and Alsace  These grievances were laid before Charles in an embassy which Berne dispatched to his court in the name of the allied cantons The duke received it with haughtiness and after having obliged the deputies to kneel down while they delivered in their remonstrance dismissed them without an answer This disdainful and ignominious treatment was ill brooked by a free people unaccustomed to crouch before the insolence of power and the warmth of their just indignation was still more inflamed by the artful policy of Louis XI who jealous of the duke of Burgundy's power now entered into a defensive alliance with the eight cantons in conjunction with the republics of Fribourg and Soleure in order to counteract the dangerous designs of that ambitious prince  But Louis still farther strengthened the Swiss by effecting a reconciliation between  them and Sigismond for the latter had no sooner surrendered to Charles those towns which he had mortgaged to him upon the terms abovementioned than he began to be sensible of the error he had committed The duke of Burgundy not only oppressed those people but seemed determined even should the florins be repayed to keep possession of these conditional territories and he avoided also the fulfilling of the promise he had made of bestowing his daughter upon the archduke From these considerations the latter was easily induced through the mediation of Louis to throw himself under the protection of the Swiss and he concluded with them the famous treaty which was confirmed the twentieth of January in the general diet assembled at Lucerne  This alliance is called the  hereditary union  an appellation appropriated to the treaties made with the house of Austria as those contracted with France are denominated treaties of  perpetual peace  By the alliance in question Sigismond renounced all right to the provinces which the Swiss had conquered from the house  of Austria the two contracting parties entered into a defensive alliance and engaged to guarantee reciprocally each other's territories Thus the Swiss after having stripped Sigismond of all his possessions in their country stipulated with him to support his right to those very provinces which he had mortgaged in order to strengthen his arms against themselves and Sigismond was under the mortifying necessity of accepting the guarantee of the most inveterate enemies of his family  This treaty which entirely changed the designs and altered the policy of the Swiss republics was solely brought about by the artful intrigues of Louis XI and the jealousy of that designing monarch turned into another channel the vast preparations of the duke of Burgundy preparations which would probably have been attended with more success had they been directed against France  Charles perceived when it was too late the imprudence of his behaviour towards the Swiss republics and he now tried every method to engage them in a neutrality but they rejected his proposals of reconciliation with firmness prepared for  a war which now appeared inevitable with their usual vigour and even advanced the florins to Sigismond who demanded the restitution of his lands and which the duke of Burgundy evaded under various pretexts The latter having concluded a separate peace with Louis who generally duped every state with which he entered into alliance and kept the most solemn treaties no longer than they were subservient to his own interest entered Swisserland with an army of sixty thousand men and laying siege to Grandson carried it by assault But his success ended here for at the subsequent battles of Grandson and Morat he was totally defeated and his attempts upon Swisserland entirely foiled  Charles entered Swisserland confident of subduing that country The effect which this unexpected and humiliating disappointment had upon his spirits and constitution is related by Philip de Comines with his usual minuteness in his Memoirs addressed to Angelo Cattho archbishop of Vienne in Dauphiné His account is curious and will give some idea of the violent and impetuous character of Charles  "His concern and distraction for his first defeat at Grandson was so great and made such deep impression on his spirits that it threw him into a violent and dangerous fit of sickness for whereas before his choler and natural heat was so great that he drank no wine only in the morning he took a little tisane sweetened with conserve of roses to refresh himself this sudden melancholy had so altered his constitution he was now forced to drink the strongest wine that could be got without any water And in order to draw the blood from his heart some burning tow was put into the cuppingglasses and applied to his side But this my lord of Vienne you know better than I for your lordship attended on him during the whole course of his illness and spared no pains that might contribute to his recovery and it was by your persuasion that the duke was prevailed upon to cut his beard which was of a prodigious length In my opinion his understanding was never so perfect nor his senses so sedate and composed after this fit of sickness as before"  Uvedale's Trans Vol I p  Nevertheless  his restless and ambitious spirit remained still unsubdued and it impelled him to attack the duke of Lorraine But that prince having engaged a body of eight thousand Swiss in his pay had the good fortune for which he was very much indebted to the valour of those troops to obtain a complete victory near  Nancy over Charles who lost his life in the battle  The death of Charles at the battle of Nancy was attended with some very extraordinary circumstances for the particulars of which see the curious account extracted from Philip de Comines and the Chronique Scandaleuse of John de Troyes in Wraxal's interesting Memoirs of the Kings of France of the House of Valois    His death put an end to this bloody war from which although the Swiss gave indeed the most distinguishing proofs of their invincible valour and spread the fame of their military virtues throughout all Europe they derived no solid advantage  "And what" says Comines "was the occasion of this war It was begun on account of a waggon of sheepskins which the lord of Romont took from a Swiss who was passing through his territories If God had not abandoned the duke it is not probable that he would have put himself into so much danger for so trifling a circumstance considering the offers that were made to him against what sort of people he was engaged and from whence neither profit nor glory could accrue to him For the Swiss were not in such repute as they are in at present and nothing could be poorer insomuch that one of their embassadors as he was endeavouring to prevent the duke from engaging in that war remonstrated that he could gain nothing by attacking them for their country was so barren that the spurs of his troops and the bits of their horses were worth more than could be furnished by all the Swiss territories in case they were conquered"  In fact the principal  and almost sole benefit resulting from it accrued to Louis XI as by the death of Charles he not only got rid of a dangerous and enterprising rival but also annexed the rich provinces of Burgundy and Artois to the crown of France  But notwithstanding the immediate advantages to the Swiss by the death of the duke of Burgundy were in themselves unimportant yet the consequences of it operated very considerably on their future politics Mary of Burgundy the only surviving child and heiress of Charles married the archduke Maximilian eldest son of the emperor Frederic III and afterwards emperor himself By this marriage the house of Austria acquired the possession of the LowCountries and having frequent disputes to settle with France relating to those territories which border upon that kingdom the alliance of the  Swiss was strenuously courted by both parties And thus this country being secured from all enterprises from without acceded as occasion offered to the two rival powers assisting each party by turns as the intrigues or rather as the subsidies of the one or the other prevailed  These intrigues gave rise to different alliances contracted with the house of Austria the kings of France the pope and the dukes of Savoy and MilanBut not to enter more minutely into their history I will only observe in general that hitherto the Swiss had acted with great disinterestedness in all their treaties and had never taken the field but either to secure their liberties or to drive their enemies out of Swisserland It was about the period of the Burgundian war that the subsidies which they obtained from Louis XI taught them the disgraceful arts of mercenary politics as the rich plunder which they took from the duke of Burgundy gave in some measure the first taint to that wonderful simplicity of manners for which they had before been so happily  distinguished till at length  Swiss venality  has become a kind of proverbial expression  I am c  LETTER XXX  Avenches  Sept  THERE is scarcely any antient town that has occasioned more controversy among antiquarians or that has given rise to such variety of conjectures concerning its original and importance as Avenches the principal burgh of a bailliage in the Pays de Vaud Some contend that it was the capital of all Helvetia because Tacitus calls it  Aventicum gentis caput  while others have endeavoured to prove that by this expression the historian meant only to denote the capital town of its particular  pagus  or district Agreeably to some accounts the city was built and a Roman colony founded there by Vespasian according to others and with more probability it was only repaired and beautified by that emperor after it had  been laid waste and almost ruined by Vitellius  Without entering however into discussions of this dry and uninteresting kind this much at least is certain that it was formerly a very considerable town and under the dominion of the Romans This appears not only from several milestones found in many parts of the Pays de Vaud most of which are numbered from  Aventicum  as the principal place of reference and also from various other inscriptions but more particularly from the ruins still existing I shall slightly mention a few of the latter merely to shew you it is not without evidence that these good people boast of their antiquity  We traced the ruins of the antient walls which appear to have enclosed a space near five miles in circumference The present town occupies but a very inconsiderable part of this ground the remainder is covered with cornfields and meadows One of the antient towers still exists it is a semicircular building with the convex side turned towards the town  We were shewn a very curious mosaic pavement discovered some years ago in ploughing up a field It is now inclosed by a barn which being let to some peasants the ignorant occupiers are taking the most effectual method to destroy this elegant piece of antiquity as fast as possible We found it strewed all over with tobaccoplants and indeed they not only cover it with damp herbs which deaden the colours and rot the pavement but suffer every person who enters to take away bits Even the Messrs of Berne were so insensible of the value of this admirable relic of antient genius that they permitted the count of Caylus to take up one of the pannels upon which the figures of two satyrs represented as embracing were greatly admired for the exquisite beauty of the execution The count designed to have conveyed them to Paris but was disappointed for by the unskilfulness of the persons employed in removing them the pannel was broken to pieces  This fine mosaic was the floor of an antient bath and is about sixty feet in  length and forty in breadth the general form is perfect and although several parts are broken off and lost yet from what remains we could easily trace the configuration of the whole  The pavement consists of three general compartments those at each extremity are regularly divided into fifteen octagons eight small squares and sixteen small triangles Five of these octagons in each compartment represented human figures in various attitudes but chiefly Bacchanalian men and women the remaining octagons were composed of three different patterns answering to each other with great exactness The vacant parts between the octagons are filled with the small squares and towards the outward border with the small triangles abovementioned The middle compartment is divided into oblong pannels in the largest of which is an octagon bath of white marble of about six feet in diameter and a foot and an half deep the sides of the bath are ornamented with dolphins Of these three compartments one is almost perfect the two others are very much defaced  Each of the pannels are encircled with several borders prettily diversified and a general border encloses the whole  Schmidt in his  Recueil d' Antiquités de la Suisse  ingeniously conjectures from a  glory  which encircles a head of Bacchus in this mosaic that it was wrought during some part of the intervening age between Vespasian and Marcus Aurelius because that mark of divinity is never seen upon any monuments of Roman antiquity prior to that period He adds that the same kind of  glory  is observed upon the head of Trajan in an antient painting at Rome upon that of Antoninus Pius on a medal and on the arch of Constantine He strengthens this conjecture by farther remarking that the headdress of one of the Bacchanalian women represented in this mosaic resembles the headdress on the medals of the empresses Plotina and Sabina  The curious reader will find in the  Recueil  cited in the text a very accurate description and engraving of this mosaic    From thence we were conducted to the ruins of an antient amphitheatre  within the walls of the bailiff's garden The general form and size of this building remain tolerably perfect as also some parts of the walls which enclosed it The diameter of the arena might be about eighty yards as far as we could judge by pacing it which must necessarily indeed have been a very uncertain estimate for one of the former bailiffs filled up the hollow with a considerable quantity of earth in order to plant it with fruittrees wisely conceiving I suppose that to have good fruit was of more value than to be able to determine the precise extent of all the antient amphitheatres that ever existed Under a tower part of which is built of Roman materials is a cell of about feet by eighteen and nearly in heighth from whence the animals were probably let loose upon the combatants On the outside are still to be seen the remains of five dens and all over the walls which are formed of brick and mortar there are several pieces of rude sculpture considerably defaced  Not far from these ruins stands a large column of white marble about feet in heighth composed of immense  masses nicely joined together without cement and near it lies scattered a considerable fragment of defaced sculpture it has much the appearance of having been once the portal of some magnificent temple At a small distance from this column in the high road we observed a cornice consisting of a large solid block of white marble which probably belonged to the same building the sculpture which is not without merit represents urns and griffins As we walked through the town we remarked several other enormous masses of cornice ornamented with seahorses and urns as also some marble columns of beautiful proportions  About a mile from Avenches near the village of Coppet are the remains of a small aqueduct it is on the other side of a little stream which separates the canton of Fribourg from that of Berne It was discovered about fifteen years ago by the accidental falling of a hill of sand which covered the aqueduct and in its fall demolished a part of it The outside is formed of stones and mortar and the inside of a red cement as hard as the old Roman tile  the vault of the arch may be about two feet and an half high and one and an half broad This aqueduct has been traced to the eastside of the town and also to near the high marble column before mentioned We were informed that it extends to the tower of Gausa between Vevay and Lausanne and that between Villarsel and Marnaw about four leagues from Coppet the solid rock is cut through in an arch of nea  ly the same dimensions But whether these several parts actually communicated with each other or indeed whether they really exist are facts which having only viewed those remains that are visible near this town I must be contented to rest on the credit of my informers  I am c  LETTER XXXI  Fribourg  September  THE town of Fribourg was built in by Berchtold IV duke of Zaeringen who endowed it with considerable  privileges Upon the extinction of the male line of the house of Zaeringen in  The house of Zaeringen was descended from the antient counts of Alsace by Berchtold count of Brisgaw His grandson Berchtold II built the castle of Zaeringen from which Berchtold III took the title of duke That castle was situated near a village of the same name not far from the present town of Freyburg capital of the Brisgaw Berchtold V the last duke was chosen emperor in in opposition to the house of Suabia but resigned in favour of Philip Upon his death his territories were divided between his collateral heirs the dukes of Teck and his two sisters Agnes and Anne The former married Egeno count of Urach by which marriage he obtained possession of Freyburg in the Brisgaw and his posterity were called counts of Freyburg Anne married Ulric count of Kybourg their daughter Hedwige was wife of Albert count of Habsbourg and mother of the emperor Rodolph I  Ulric of Kybourg obtained the sovereignty of the town in right of his wife Anne sister of the last duke Berchtold V It came by marriage into the possession of Eberhard count of HabsbourgLauffenbourg who sold it to his cousin Rhodolph of Habsbourg afterwards emperor and founder of the house of Austria During this period a continual rivalship subsisting between  Berne and Fribourg they were frequently engaged in mutual hostilities at length however all differences were composed and the two cities in entered into a perpetual alliance  Fribourg continued under the dominion of the house of Austria and was a party in all the quarrels in which that family were engaged with the Swiss republics until the middle of the fifteenth century when by a very singular revolution it renounced all allegiance to Albert archduke of Austria and brother to the emperor Frederic III and put itself under the protection of the duke of Savoy From this aera it occasionally assisted the cantons against the house of Austria and in the war between the Swiss and Charles the Bold the troops of this republic had a share in the victories of Grandson and Morat Soon after the last of these battles the house of Savoy at the intercession of Berne renounced all right and title to the town of Fribourg By this means she became a free and independent republic and in was admitted together with Soleure a member of the Helvetic confederacy  The government of Fribourg is entirely aristocratical the sovereign and legislative authority being vested in the great council consisting of the members of which are chosen by that council and from a few patrician families The little council of in which resides the executive power and the secret council consisting of members are subdivisions of the great council I shall not enter into a minute detail of this government which resembles some inconsiderable differences excepted the other aristocratical states of Swisserland The most remarkable circumstance that distinguishes it is the mode of electing the members of the secret and of the little council The names of the candidates are placed privately in a box containing as many divisions as there are persons who solicit the charge Into each of these partitions the suffrages are thrown and the several electors put in their ballots as chance directs without knowing to which of the candidates they may happen to give their vote and he who has the most of these casual ballots is chosen This method has the appearance of effectually guarding against family  influence nevertheless if it be considered that the candidate can only be taken from certain families and under certain restrictions it may well be questioned whether it sufficiently answers the purpose for which it was intended  This canton is entirely catholic It is supposed to contain above souls without including the town in which there are about Its territory consists chiefly of excellent pasture produces some corn and but little wine The commerce here is too inconsiderable to be mentioned and literature is by no means in a more flourishing state The town stands on a hill in a very singular situation half encircled by the river Sane the banks whereof are formed by naked perpendicular rocks but the adjacent country exhibits a beautiful variegated scene of rising grounds rich meadows and fine forests  This republic draws considerable subsidies from France both in money and salt and it is computed that in proportion to its size none of the other cantons have so many troops in that service It has long been a controverted  question whether Swisserland gains or loses by furnishing such numbers of her natives to serve in foreign armies That the fidelity of these troops is so well recognised as to be chosen above all others to be the lifeguards of several sovereigns is a circumstance which in that respect undoubtedly redounds much to the honour of the national character of the Swiss but on the other hand to traffic with the blood of their subjects and let them out for paltry subsidies to fight the battles of any king in any cause seems to betray a mercenary spirit uncontrouled by considerations of justice and humanity It has been urged that were it not for their furnishing these supplies to foreign nations Swisserland would be overstocked with inhabitants and that the people would be obliged like the northern hives of old to emigrate for subsistence for in many parts there is no commerce and the mountainous tracts of this country cannot supply sufficient provision for such a numerous people In reply to this reasoning it may be alledged that they do not make use of all the resources in their  power commerce might be more generally cultivated and encouraged as there is no part of Swisserland which is far removed from some of the principal rivers and great lakes all of which have a direct communication with the sea  But to be convinced that they have not exhausted all the advantages to which they might resort let them look back on antient Greece and the immense populousness in so confined a country or what is more open to their observation let them consider the present state of the United Provinces and the abundance those industrious people enjoy on a tract of land snatched from an element perpetually reclaiming its prior occupancy But the Swiss need not be sent to antient or foreign nations for examples they have them much nearer home Geneva and St Gallen are for their extent exceedingly populous and yet the natural productions of their lands are by no means sufficient to support all the inhabitants Appenzel is entirely mountainous as well as the district of Vallengin nevertheless both those countries are remarkably well peopled and they derive from the neighbouring  nations by means of their commerce and industry all the necessaries of life in great abundance Indeed Swisserland is so far from being overstocked with people that in most of the great towns there is a manifest want of inhabitants Nor is this depopulation confined to the towns alone for several parts of this country and more particularly the Pays de Vaud are considerably less peopled than they were in the last century insomuch that hands are frequently wanting for the common purposes of agriculture  These reflections seem to prove the mistaken policy of Swisserland in letting out her troops to foreign states but the evil is too deeply rooted to admit of a speedy cure Individuals it is true make fortunes by this kind of traffic but the public suffers Some circumstances however may be remarked in its favour as by this practice the several cantons not only have in constant reserve without the least expence a body of welldisciplined forces which they can recall at a moment's warning but it becomes the interest for that reason of those foreign  powers whom they furnish with these troops not to foment any divisions among the United States which might render the presence of their troops necessary at home Add to this that the privileges which the Swiss enjoy in France and the very advantageous articles relating to commerce secured to them in all their treaties seem to strengthen the argument for continuing their connections of this kind with that kingdomHaving thus stated the principal topics which are urged by the opposite partizans of this controverted question I will leave you to determine on which side the balance prevails  We are now at the small village of Neuneck in our way to Berne we made a little circuit to this place in order to see an hermitage that lies about a league from the town of Fribourg and which has been much talked of on account of the singularity of its construction It is formed in the solid rock and the chief curiosity consists in its having been the work of two men as such it is an astonishing performance but in any other respect it is hardly worth visiting In  the last century an hermit scooped out a hollow in this rock just sufficient for him to lie at his full length but his successor desiring a more commodious mansion hewed in the heart of the mountain a chapel several apartments staircases c The length of the whole is above feet One room is feet long and broad the steeple of the chapel if it may be so called is So feet high and the chimney of the kitchen The hermit who perforated this dwelling in the rock was near thirty years at the work What a wretched waste of time and industry But such is the folly of sequestered superstition that for want of better occupations to employ the mind it frequently has recourse to laborious trifles The situation of this hermitage is beautiful the rock in which it is cut hangs over the river Sane which meandring through two chains of hills covered with wood fills up all the valley beneath The present hermit is a German and with him lives an old soldier his friend  From this hermitage to Neuneck at which place the canton of Berne commences  the country is rich and finely wooded on our right we had a distant but sublime view of a range of rude rocks with some glaciers rising above them and closing the prospect The sun was now going down the various tints of the eveningthe purple gleam upon the naked rocksand the rays of the settingsun upon the glaciers which seemed to glow almost into transparencycast such a mild and beautiful radiance over this magnificent scene as even the luminous pencil of that celebrated Grecian artist who is said to have painted  "quae pingi non possunt fulgura fulgetra  Apelles vid Plin H N lib c  "  would in vain have attempted to imitate  I am c  LETTER XXXII  FROM the first formation of the Helvetic union additional cantons were from time to time admitted into it until at length the reception of Appenzel finally closed the confederacy During these intervals several of those republics which  afterwards became members of the general league were only allies of some of the particular cantons enjoying the same privileges and standing in the same relation as the present allies and associates of the United States Among these Fribourg and Soleure having upon the conclusion of the war with Charles the Bold entered into an alliance with Zuric Berne and Lucerne demanded to be admitted into the Helvetic union This alliance was considered by the five other combined cantons as a breach of their antient treaty accordingly they refused to receive them The dispute grew warm hostilities were upon the point of breaking out when a native of the canton of Underwalden singly effected a reconciliation and saved his country from all the impending horrors of a civil war  The name of this celebrated person was Nicholas de Flue he had formerly filled the office of landamman of the canton of Underwalden with the highest advantage to his reputation but suddenly retiring from the world in a fit of gloomy superstition unworthy of his virtues and character he turned hermit  and practised all the severities of that austere mode of life with the strictest observance But although the flame of patriotism was smothered in his breast by an illdirected zeal for mistaken duties it was not extinguished and he no sooner heard in the depth of his solitude of those public animosities which threatened a fatal breach between the confederate cantons than his patriotism prevailed over his superstition and he quitted his unprofitable hermitage in order to exert those active and public virtues the very lowest of which singly outweighs whole years of useless and unrequired mortifications Accordingly this extraordinary man presented himself before the deputies assembled at Stantz and so forcibly represented to them by his conciliating and persuasive eloquence the destructive consequences that would attend their disunion that they chose him arbiter of the dispute The consequence was that by his sole mediation all differences between the contending parties were amicably settled and Fribourg and Soleure were received into the Helvetic confederacy Upon this occasion the eight antient cantons entered  into a covenant called the  Convention of Stantz  by which the several articles of union and mutual protection were permanently fixed  Nicholas de Flue after having so happily composed the public dissensions returned to his hermitage and there died He is buried at Saxelen a small village in the canton of Underwalden and on his tomb is inscribed the following epitaph  "Nicolas de Flue quitted his wife and children to go into the desert he served God nineteen years and an half without eating any fleshmeat He died "  This frivolous epitaph strongly marks the bigotted spirit of that dark age in which it was composed the narrowminded author totally overlooking the patriot in the hermit saw nothing so truly meritorious in the life of the deceased as his having suppressed those social and public energies which dignify human nature in order to practise the debasing austerities of a superstitious and cloistered religionist    The articles to which Fribourg and Soleure acceded upon their admission into the league together with the abovementioned convention are considered by all the best historians of Swisserland as the great basis of the federal union between these celebrated states The subsequent reception of the three other cantons Basil Schaffhausen and Appenzel made no change therein they having subscribed to  the same terms which Fribourg and Soleure had accepted Not to enter however into a minute detail of this particular convention I will endeavour to lay before you a short but clear view of the general Helvetic confederacy  The code of public law if I may so express it between the combined republics of Swisserland is founded upon the treaty of  This treaty regulates the articles of war and was contracted between the eight antient cantons in conjunction with the republic of Solcure It ordains that no Swiss soldier shall quit his ranks in time of action even although he should be dangerously wounded  "Nous entendons aussi que si quelqu'un s'est  blesse en quelque façon que ce fust en combatant ou en assaillant de sorte qu'il seroit inutile pour se deffendre il demeurera non obstant aussi avec les autres jusques a ce que la bataille soit expirée et pour cela ne sera estime suyard et ne  en fascheraton en sa personne ny en son bien aucunement"  Sempach in upon that of Stantz and upon the treaty of peace concluded at Araw between the protestant and catholic cantons It appears from these several treaties which include or enlarge those which preceded that the Helvetic union is a perpetual  defensive  alliance between  the thirteen independent contracting powers to protect each other by their united forces against all foreign enemies whatsoever Accordingly if any member of the union should be attacked that particular canton has a right to demand succours from the  The respectable author of the  Account of Swisserland  the only English publication of merit concerning Swisserland that I have met with has fallen into a mistake in his description of the Helvetic union and his error has been adopted by the Abbè Mably in his  Droit Public de l'Europe  by the compilers of the  Encyclopedic  and by several other writers of distinction  After having given a description of the Helvetic union he concludes the relation as follows  "So far are they the thirteen cantons from making one body or one commonwealth that only the three old cantons are directly allied with every one of the other twelve There is indeed such a connection established between them that in case any one canton were attacked all the other twelve would be obliged to march to its succour but it would be by virtue of the relation that two cantons may have to a third and not of any direct alliance subsisting between every one of them As for example of the eight old cantons Lucerne has a right of calling but five to its succour in case of attack but  some of those five have a right of calling others with whom they are allied though Lucerne be not so that at last all must march by virtue of particular alliances and not of any general one amongst them all"  The abovecited account of the Helvetic union would better have suited the league of the eight cantons before the convention of Stantz when the confederate states were not so absolutely and directly united together as they are at present and their alliance did not perhaps totally exclude every treaty of the same kind with other powers It was only by the articles of that celebrated convention and the alliance of the eight cantons with Fribourg and Soleure that the union became absolutely fixed and general It must be confessed however that several Swiss historians have given the same idea of the Helvetic union as that abovementioned and that even now authors differ considerably upon some important articles of the league  whole confederate  body and in case of war the several forces to be supplied by each canton are precisely specified It appears however from the stipulations to which the five later cantons agreed that they do not in every respect enjoy equal prerogatives with the eight antient ones For the latter reserved to themselves a right in case the question for declaring war against any foreign state should be  unanimously  carried in their assembly to require the assistance of the other cantons  without assigning the motive of such their resolution whereas the former cannot commence hostilities without the consent of the confederates and if the enemy should be willing to enter into a negotiation concerning the matter in dispute it must be referred to the arbitration of the eight antient cantons It is farther stipulated that if a war should break out between the lastmentioned cantons the others are to observe a strict neutrality  The next essential object of the league is to preserve peace and good order among the several cantons It is therefore covenanted that all public discords of this nature shall be finally settled between the contending parties in an amicable manner and for this purpose particular judges and arbiters are expresly appointed and empowered to compose the dissensions that may happen to arise To this is added a reciprocal guarantee of the forms of government established in the respective commonwealths for by the convention of Stantz it was agreed in order to prevent internal factions and revolts in any of the allied cantons that in case of rebellion  the magistracy of such canton should be assisted by the forces of the others Accordingly the history of Swisserland affords many instances of protection and assistance reciprocally given between the confederates in defence and support of the constitution of particular cantons  No separate engagement whatsoever which any of the cantons may enter into can be valid if inconsistent with the fundamental articles of this general union or in other words the reciprocal contract between the members of the league supersedes every other species of public obligation With the foregoing exceptions the several combined states are distinct from and independent of each other they may contract alliances with any power or reject the same although all the others have acceded to it  The five cantons which agreed not to conclude any treaty without the consent of the eight are necessarily excluded from this power together with those particular cantons which have bound themselves by private treaties not to contract any foreign alliance without the reciprocal consent of the others as for instance Uri Schweitz and Underwalden by the alliance at Brunnen in But this depends upon particular treaties and has no relation to the general union In fact every canton is restrained by the general articles of the Helvetic union but conforming to those no one republic is controuled by the resolutions of the majority of the confederate cantons in any other instance whatsoever  may grant auxiliary troops to foreign  princes may prohibit the money of the other cantons from being current within their own territories may impose taxes and in short perform every other act of absolute sovereignty  The public affairs of the Helvetic body and their allies are discussed and determined in the several diets and these are  I The general diets or general assemblies of the thirteen cantons and of their allies  II The particular diets as those of the eight antient cantons those of the protestant cantons with the deputies of the protestants of Glaris and Appenzel of the towns of St Gallen Bienne and Mulhausen called the  evangelical conferences  those of the Roman catholic cantons with the deputies of the catholics of Glaris and Appenzel of the  abbot of St Gallen and of the republic of the Vallais called the  golden alliance  as also several others of particular cantons which besides being members of the general confederacy have distinct and separate alliances with each other  The ordinary meetings of the  general  diet are held once a year and continue sitting one month the extraordinary ones are summoned upon particular occasions This diet is principally convened to deliberate upon the best measures for the security of the Helvetic body The canton of Zuric appoints the time and place of the metting and convokes the deputies by a circular letter The deputy of the lastmentioned canton also presides unless the diet is holden in the territory of any of the other cantons in which case the deputy of that canton in which the assembly meets is president  This diet formerly assembled at Baden but since the conclusion of the civil war in between Zuric and Berne on one side and Lucerne Uri Schweitz Underwalden and Zug on the other  when the five latter renounced the coregency of Baden the diets have been holden at Frauenfield in Thurgaw Each canton sends as many deputies as it thinks proper  It would be descending into a tedious detail and trespassing too much on your patience were I to enter into the particular connections which the several allies have either with the whole Helvetic body or with some of the cantons and the different nature of these respective alliances Suffer me only to remark in general that the allies may be divided into associate and into confederate states of the former are the abbot and town of St Gallen the towns of Bienne and Mulhausen of the latter are the Grisons and the republic of the Vallais the town and republic of Geneva the principality of Neuchatel and the bishop of Basil  The states thus comprised under the general denomination of associates and confederates enjoy by virtue of this union a total independence on all foreign dominion and partake of all the privileges and immunities granted to the  Swiss in other countries And notwithstanding some of these states are allied only with some particular cantons yet in case any of them should be attacked those cantons with whom they are in alliance would not only supply them with succours but would also require the joint assistance of the other cantons so that by these means should any one member of the whole body be attacked all the others would come to its defence either as guarantees themselves or as auxiliaries of the actual guarantees  If the reader should be desirous of a more distinct information concerning the Helvetic league he is referred to Stannyan's account of Swisserland published in but more particularly to the article  Corps Helvetique  in the  Dictionaire de la Suisse  last edition which article as well as those of Berne Geneva and Neuchatel are admirably well drawn up  It is chiefly from the lastmentioned work as also from Watteville's  Histoire de la Confederation Helvetique  from Fasis's  Staats und ErdBesehreibung der ganzen Heivetischen Eidgenosenchaft  and from the several treaties between the cantons in Du Mont's  Corps Diplomatique  that the above general account of the Helvetic union has been extracted The truth of those relations have been confirmed to the author by some Swiss gentlemen well versed in the general constitution of their country    I am c  LETTER XXXIII  Berne  Sept  I Was very much struck upon my entrance into Berne with its singular neatness and beauty I do not remember to have seen any town Bath alone excepted the first appearance whereof had so pleasing an effect The principal street is broad and long the houses are mostly uniform built of a greyish stone upon arcades which are admirably well paved Through the middle of the street runs a lively stream of the clearest water in a channel constructed for its reception but besides this stream it abounds with fountains not less ornamental to the place than beneficial to the inhabitants The river Aar flows close by the town and indeed almost surrounds it winding its serpentine course over a rocky bottom much below the level of the streets and for a considerable way forming by its banks which are very steep and craggy a kind of natural rampart The cathedral church is a noble piece of Gothic architecture it stands upon a platform  that has been raised at a great expence from the bed of the river and which commands as fine a view as any I have seen in Swisserland  The country around is richly cultivated and agreeably diversified with hills lawns wood and water the river flows rapidly below and an abrupt chain of high and rugged alps appear at some distance whose tops are covered with eternal snow Such an assemblage of beautiful objects would in any view present a most striking prospect but its effect becomes greatly heightened when seen from the midst of a large town  All the public buildings are in a most noble simplicity of style and announce the riches and grandeur of the republic The arsenal contains arms for sixty thousand men besides a considerable quantity of cannon which were cast here The granary is an excellent institution similar to that of Zuric but it differs from that of Geneva as the expence does not fall chiefly upon the poor for the bakers are not compelled by government to purchase their corn from the public magazine This reservoir if I may be  allowed the expression always contains a large provision of that commodity which is supplied in consequence of particular agreements for that purpose by France Sardinia and Holland and out of which they partly furnish Geneva Neuchatel and Basil The hospitals which are large airy and well built are excellently regulated both with respect to the care and attention paid to the sick and to the cleanliness of the several wards The town is kept neat by a number of felons who are sentenced to this drudgery during a certain time according to the nature of their offences and as capital condemnations are very rare this is the most usual manner of punishing their criminals These culprits are distinguished by an iron collar with a hook projecting over their heads  The library is a small but wellchosen collection and contains some very curious manuscripts of these Mr Sinner a man of great erudition has published a very satisfactory and judicious catalogue He has not only set forth their titles and ascertained their age but has also given a general and succinct account of their respective subjects and from many  of them has published extracts equally curious and interesting Among these MSS are some of the thirteenth century consisting of several songs and romances of the Troubadours written in that and the preceding ages which merit the attention of those who are conversant in that species of antient poetry  I have been much disappointed in not seeing the great Haller his very infirm state of health would not admit of his receiving a visit from us  He died the beginning of the present year  I need not tell you how eminently that celebrated author has distinguished himself in every species of polite literature and in several branches of natural philosophy Unlike certain minute philosophers of the present age whose atheistical and infidel writings are too well known and too widely disseminated this great man is so unfashionable as to have followed the steps of a Locke and a Newton and to have proved himself both in his life and his writings a zealous friend and able advocate of christianity When literature and philosophy instead of being employed as they too often have been in supporting sceptical  tenets by artful sophistry thus lend their joint assistance to the cause of religion it is then only that they become an honour to the possessor and a benefit to society  Learning is neither so universally encouraged nor so successfully cultivated here as at Zuric the academical studies are almost solely directed to those branches of knowledge more essentially necessary for entering into the church The society for the promotion of agriculture is almost the only establishment that directly tends to the progress of the arts and sciences and even this meets with no great countenance from government There is but little commerce in the capital some few manufactures indeed chiefly of linen and silk have been established but they are carried on by those only who have no prospect of being admitted into the sovereign council For those families who have any influence in public affairs would hold themselves degraded were they to engage in any branch of commerce and as offices of the state except bailliages are in general not very profitable nor indeed numerous many of  them enter as their sole resource into foreign armies With respect to those among them who have sufficient interest to be chosen into the sovereign council as they must have attained the full age of twentynine before they are eligible and in the mean while as very few of them apply their minds to literary pursuits they usually from mere want of employment waste the interval in an idle and dissipated course of life Nevertheless there are several members of the sovereign council who are justly distinguished for their political abilities and being thoroughly acquainted with the respective interests of the different powers of Europe they know perfectly well how to avail themselves of every conjuncture which may be turned to the advantage or the glory of their own republic  The inhabitants of Berne value themselves much upon their politeness to strangers and indeed it is but doing them strict justice to acknowledge that they have shewn us with that peculiar frankness and unaffected affability I have so often had occasion to admire in the Swiss every civility in their power  According to the historians of Berne this town was built by Berchtold V duke of Zaeringen and was from its foundation an imperial city Upon the death of the duke in the emperor Frederic II conferred upon the inhabitants considerable privileges and drew up also a code of legislation which forms the basis of their present civil laws The liberty which this town enjoyed attracted great numbers of inhabitants from the adjacent country who found here a sure asylum from the oppression of the nobles From its first foundation Berne was engaged in perpetual wars with its neighbours and for some time with the house of Austria notwithstanding which the town continued to aggrandise itself by degrees and considerably to enlarge its territory In the year Berne acceded to the Helvetic confederacy and so great was its power even at that early period that it obtained the second rank after Zuric among the allied states Since the acquisition of the Pays de Vaud the domains of this canton form nearly the third part of Swisserland and about the fourth of its actual population it contains about three hundred and fifty  thousand souls besides about eleven thousand in the capital By the introduction of the reformation into the town in the government acquired a large encrease of its revenues arising from the ecclesiastical possessions which were very considerable Not long after that period the whole canton followed the example of the capital and the reformed religion was universally established throughout its extensive dominions  The Pays de Vaud having been conquered from the house of Savoy as the German division of the canton was from the states of the empire justice is administered and the taxes regulated in those two provinces by a set of laws and customs peculiar to each for they have respectively preserved the several distinct usages which were in force among them before they came into the possession of Berne Each of these divisions has its treasurer and its chamber of appeal resident at Berne the chamber of appeal belonging to the Pays de Vaud judges in the last resort but the inhabitants of the German district may again appeal from theirs to the sovereign council  I am c  LETTER XXXIV  WERE I to attempt entering into an exact disquisition concerning the government of Berne my letter would not only exceed its proper limits but would hardly be contained within the extent of an ordinary pamphlet I am persuaded therefore you will readily excuse me from putting your patience to so tedious a trial but you would probably think me very inconsistent indeed if after having already in the course of our correspondence descended too minutely perhaps into less interesting details I should totally pass over in silence a government the wisdom of whose administration is so generally and so justly admired Let me endeavour then sensible as I am of my inability to treat the subject as it deserves to sketch at least the general outlines of this constitution  The sovereign power resides in the great council of two hundred which when compleat consists of members They are chosen from the  burghers of the town from whom they are considered as deriving their power and as acting by deputation The authority with which they are invested is in some respects the most absolute and uncontrouled of any of the aristocratical states of Swisserland The government of Lucerne is called indeed the most aristocratical of all the cantons and it may be so perhaps with respect to the small number of families to which the administration of affairs is entrusted but no war can be declared no peace concluded no alliance made no taxes imposed without the consent of their burghers in a general assembly At Fribourg and Soleure the burghers are likewise convened upon particular occasions Whereas the sovereign council of Berne and it is a peculiarity which distinguishes it from all the other similar republics in the confederate cantons is restrained by no constitutional check of this kind as a general assembly of the burghers is never convened for any purpose whatsoever  The executive powers of government are delegated by the sovereign council to the  senate or smaller council chosen by themselves out of their own body the former assembles ordinarily three times a week and extraordinarily upon particular occasions the latter every day Sundays excepted  The senate comprising the two advoyers or chiefs of the republic is composed of twentyseven members and from this select body are taken the principal magistrates of the commonwealth When a vacancy happens in this senate the mode of election is as followsTwentysix balls three of which are golden are put into a box and drawn by the several members those who draw the three golden ones nominate three electors out of their body In the same manner of balloting seven members are chosen from the great council who also nominate seven electors out of their own body These ten electors fix upon a certain number of candidates not exceeding ten nor less than six and those among these candidates who have the fewest votes in the sovereign council retire till their number is reduced to four then four balls two golden and two silver  are drawn by the four remaining candidates the two who draw the former are put in nomination and he who has the greatest number of suffrages in the sovereign council is chosen But in order to be eligible the candidate must have been a member of the great council ten years and must be married  The sovereign council is generally filled up every ten years as within that period there is usually a deficiency of eighty members to complete the whole number of two hundred and ninetynine and this council determines the time of election by vote That point being settled each advoyer nominates two of the new members each seizenier and each member of the senate one apiece two or three other officers of state have likewise the same privilege There is also a certain number of persons who claim by virtue of their offices a right of being elected and their claim is generally admitted These several nominations and pretensions commonly amount in the whole to about fifty of the new members the remaining vacancies are filled up by the suffrages of the senate and the seizeniers  The  Seizeniers  are sixteen members of the great council drawn yearly from the abbayes or tribes two from each of the four great ones and one from each of the remaining eight The candidates are generally  I say  generally  because it is not absolutely fixed that all the seizeniers must have been bailiffs for if it happen that in one tribe there are two persons one of whom has been a bailiff and the other is a member of the great council they draw lots for the charge And should a member of the great council be the only one of his tribe he becomes seizenier of course provided he be eligible In order to be seizenier the candidate must be married and have neither his father or brother in the senate  taken from those who have exercised the office of bailiffs and they are elected not by a plurality of voices but by lot Every year during three days at Easter all other employments in the state are supposed to cease except those of the bannerets and the seizeniers who during this suspension are invested with a power similar to that of the Roman censors and in case of maladministration may deprive any member of the great council or of the senate of his seat but it is a power which they never exercise However should they think proper  to exert it their sentence must be confirmed by the sovereign council  The principal magistrates are the two advoyers the two treasurers and the four bannerets they are each of them chosen by a majority of voices in the sovereign council and are yearly confirmed in their respective offices The advoyers hold their post for life the treasurers six years and the bannerets four At Easter the advoyer in office delivers up his authority in full council to his colleague The  reigning  advoyer as he is called has a particular seat assigned to him in the councilchamber somewhat elevated under a canopy the seal of the republic lies upon the table before him He never delivers his opinion except it is demanded and he has no vote unless the numbers are equal and in that case he has the casting voice The advoyer out of office is the first senator in rank and president of the secret council  The two treasurers one for the German district and the other for the Pays de Vaud form in conjunction with the four bannerets an oeconomical chamber  or council of finances this council examines and passes the accounts of the bailiffs and receives the revenues of all others that are accountable to government The four bannerets together with the advoyer out of office as also the senior treasurer and two members of the senate compose a committee or secret council in which all state affairs that require greater secrecy than is likely to be observed in so numerous a body as the sovereign council are discussed and they have the power of determining upon points of very considerable importance  I have only described and as concisely as I was able consistently with giving you a general idea of their nature these eight magistracies as being the chief offices of the state and exercised by members of the senate But notwithstanding that the general form of this constitution is entirely aristocratical and though the senate possesses a very considerable influence yet it does not enjoy that almost exclusive authority which is observable in the governments of Lucerne Fribourg and Soleure For by several wise and wellobserved regulations the sovereign council  although it delegates the most important concerns of government to the senate yet assembles at stated times and superintends the administration of public affairs In short the sovereign council of Berne constantly convene and exercise their authority independent of the senate  The administration is carried on throughout the several departments of government with a wonderful precision and every ordinance is executed with as much dispatch as in a monarchical state The aristocratical form is frequently of all modes of government the most oppressive to the people as instead of one despot they are liable to suffer under the tyranny of many But this objection will not hold with respect to Berne or any other of the aristocratical states of Swisserland they are each of them administred with great wisdom and moderation and the respective rulers are particularly cautious not to encroach upon the privileges of the subject  The canton of Berne is divided into a certain number of districts called bailliages over which bailiffs are chosen from the sovereign council and as these  are the most profitable posts under the government they are the great objects of general pursuit Formerly the bailiffs were elected by the majority of voices in the council but as this method rendered the members entirely dependent upon those who had the chief credit and influence in the commonwealth a law passed in which altered the mode of election and they are now chosen by lot No competitor however can be received as a candidate in opposition to one who has been longer a member of the sovereign council than himself for instance he who was admitted a member in cannot stand against one who was chosen in None but married men are capable of being elected into this office nor can any person be chosen more than once for the principal bailliages those of a less valuable kind may be possessed three times  The several bailiffs are representatives of the sovereign power in their respective districts Accordingly they put in force the edicts of government collect the public revenues act as justices of the peace and are judges in civil and criminal  causes except where there is any local jurisdiction However in civil causes beyond a certain value an appeal lies to the courts of Berne and in criminal ones the process after it is made out in the bailiff's court undergoes a revision in the senate who refer it to the criminal chamber and having received the report pass sentence finally unless in capital cases when their sentence must be confirmed by the sovereign council The bailiff delivers in his accounts to the oeconomical chamber to which court an appeal lies in case of exaction either on the part of the bailiff or of his officers and with respect to those misdemeanors that are punishable by fine and of which the bailiff is entitled to a share the quantum of the respective penalties is settled by the legislature with the most scrupulous exactness and not left to the arbitrary decision of an interested judge  From all these considerations it should seem that every possible precaution has been taken by government to prevent the extortions of the bailiffs but instances  have not been wanting to prove that these laws and regulations wise and strict as they are may be eluded Indeed there appears to be one circumstance which must render appeals for redress against the exactions of the bailiffs unless of the most notorious and flagrant kind not always to be heard with impartiality the council of two hundred before whom these appeals are finally brought consisting of members who either have been who are or who expect to be bailiffs and thus the judges are in some measure interested to screen the offenders It must be acknowledged that this is one of the greatest defects in the administration of justice nevertheless its ill consequence in the government of Berne has been much exaggerated by some writers as it is certain that where bailiffs have been guilty of oppressions frequent examples occur of their being impartially and severely punished  The profits of this office arise from a certain portion of the different taxes and duties paid to government in the respective bailliages In the German division  of the canton the bailiff is entitled upon the death of every peasant to a certain determinate part of the inheritance his share it is true is very inconsiderable nevertheless in some situations it may prove a very distressing and oppressive tax upon the family However this is the only instance I have met with where the peasants are liable to any imposition which can justly be deemed grievous  Sumptuary laws are in force throughout this canton and the wearing of gold silver lace c and even of silk is expressly prohibited The  chamber of reform  however has found it necessary upon some occasions to relax the rigour of these laws Indeed the vast strides which luxury has made within this century is very perceivable throughout Swisserland and there is no place where its progress has been more rapid than at Berne The attention of government has not been wanting to restrain it as appears by the laws that have repeatedly been enacted for that purpose an attention however which in many instances has not proved altogether as successful as it  was well directed notwithstanding the sovereign council has given the several fines incurred by those persons who transgress these ordinances to the members of the  chamber of reform  In one respect however their laudable endeavours have been more effectual Not long ago the spirit of gaming had arisen in Berne to such an extravagant heighth as to have overwhelmed several families in total ruin Upon this occasion the sovereign council interposed its authority by very salutary regulations and in order to enforce the observance of them the more strictly every member of that council is obliged to take an oath by which he swears that he will inform against any transgressor that comes within his observation By this law all public games of hazard are expressly prohibited and in other kind of games the parties are restrained from playing for more than a certain sum particularly specified  Although there are no standing armies in Swisserland yet in many of the cantons and particularly in this the militia is so well regulated that government could assemble a very considerable body  of men at a moment's warning To this end every male towards the age of sixteen is enrolled in the militia and about a third of the whole number are formed into particular regiments composed of fusileers and electionaries the former consisting of batchelors and the latter of married men Every person thus enrolled is obliged to provide himself at his own expence with an uniform a musket and a certain quantity of powder and ball and no peasant is allowed to marry unless he produces his uniform and his arms Every year a certain number of officers who are called Land Majors are deputed by the council of war throughout the canton to inspect the arms of the soldiers to complete the regiments and to exercise the militia and upon their return they make their report to that council Besides this annual review the regiments are occasionally exercised by particular veteran soldiers appointed for that purpose  Besides the arms which are kept in the arsenal of Berne there is also a certain quantity in the arsenal of each bailliage sufficient for the militia of that  district and likewise a sum of money amounting to three months pay which is appropriated to the electionaries in case of actual service The dragoons are chosen from the substantial framers as each person is obliged to provide his own horse and accoutrements In time of peace the advoyer out of office is president of the council of war and a member of that council is commander of the militia of the Pays de Vaud but in time of war a general in chief is nominated who commands all the forces of the republic  A certain number of regiments being thus always in readiness signals are fixed on the highest part of each bailliage for the assembling of the militia at a particular place appointed for that purpose in each district and there they receive orders where to march  Swelled as my letter already is to an immoderate size and much more so than I intended yet I cannot forbear trying your patience a little longer just to mention an institution which strikes me as well for its singularity as for its utility I mean what is called the  exterior state  It is a model in miniature if I may so  express myself of the sovereign council and resembles its prototype in every circumstance This exterior state is composed of those burghers who have not attained the age requisite for entering into the council of two hundred they assemble frequently and go through all the regular forms of government They have their great council their senate their two advoyers regent and nonregent their treasurers their bannerets their seizeniers in short every magistrate and officer of state which belong to the constitution all of whom are chosen in the usual manner and with the accustomed ceremonies The post of advoyer in this mimic community is solicited with great assiduity and sometimes obtained at a considerable expence as the successful candidate is sure of being admitted into the great council of two hundred without any farther recommendation This body possesses a certain number of bailliages which consist of several ruined castles dispersed over the canton it has also its common treasure and its debts In this latter article however it by no means resembles the actual government of  Berne which is not only free from debts but possessed of a very considerable fund in reserve  This remarkable institution may be considered as a political seminary for the youth of Berne It renders them acquainted with the constitution of their country and as in their frequent assemblies the several members debate upon all kinds of political subjects it affords them an opportunity of exercising and improving their talents and by that means of becoming more capable of serving the public whenever they may be admitted to a share in the administration of government  I am c  LETTER XXXV  Langenau  Sept  YOU have heard perhaps of Michel Schuppach the famous Swiss doctor of whose intuitive sagacity in discovering the seat of disorders and applying suitable remedies to them many wonderful stories are recounted by travellers  and which generally I suppose have encreased in the marvellous like Virgil's Progress of Fame in proportion as they receded from the scene of action I am now lodged in the house of this celebrated Aesculapius it is situated above the village of Langenau on the side of a steep mountain and from that circumstance he is generally known by the appellation of  the physician of the mountain  Upon our arrival here we found the doctor in his apartment surrounded by a number of peasants who were consulting him upon their respective complaints each having brought with him a small bottle containing some of his water for it is by inspecting the urine that this medical sage pretends to judge of the state of the patient His figure is extremely corpulent he has a penetrating eye and one of the besthumoured countenances I ever saw He sets himself opposite to the person who consults him one moment examining the water and the next the patient and continues regarding alternately the one and the other for some time always whistling during the intervals He then opens  the state of the case acquaints the consultant with the nature of his complaints and has often the good fortune to hit upon the true cause In a word his knack of discovering disorders by urine has gained such implicit faith in his skill that one might as well doubt of the Pope's infallibility before a zealous catholic as of the doctor's in the presence of his patients He has certainly performed several great cures and the rumour of them hath brought him patients from all quarters of Europe There are at this time in his house and in the village several English and French people together with many Swiss who are come hither for his advice  The doctor was formerly it seems a village surgeon has a slight tincture of anatomy and is esteemed a proficient in botany and chemistry but his reputation as a physician has now been established some years He is said to have but little acquaintance with the theory of physic the greatest part of his knowledge being derived from his extensive practice notwithstanding he never stirs a quarter of a mile from his own house  for he would not take the trouble of going to Berne even to attend the King of France  It is more than probable that much of this extraordinary man's success in his practice is owing to the great faith of his patients to the benefit they receive from change of climate to the salubrious air of this mountain and to the amusement arising from that constant succession of different company which assemble in this place in order to apply to him for assistance But whatever may have been the causes of his celebrity it has come to him as all accounts agree unsought for by himself He has certainly many excellent qualities humane and charitable to the highest degree he not only furnishes the indigent peasants who consult him with medicines gratis but generally makes them a present in money besides and he always appropriates a certain portion of his gains to the poor of his parish His wife as also his granddaughters who live with him are dressed like the peasant women of the country and he has shewn his good sense in giving the latter no better than a plain education  the eldest he bestowed in marriage when she was but fifteen upon one of his assistants and gave with her l no inconsiderable portion for this country He procured a match for her so early he said to prevent her being spoiled by the young gentlemen telling her she was pretty and inspiring her with the ambition of marrying above her rank  If domestic harmony and the most perfect simplicity of manners have any pretensions to please you would be highly delighted with this rural family The wife is a notable active woman and not only superintends all the houshold affairs with remarkable cleverness but even performs great part of the business with her own hands she assists her husband likewise in making up his medicines and as he talks no other language than the SwissGerman she serves occasionally as his interpreter And as a proof of his confidence in her administration of his affairs she acts also as his treasurer and receives all his fees which in the course of a year amount to a considerable sum for although he never demands more  than the price of his medicines yet no gentleman consults him without giving him an additional gratuity Many presents have likewise been made to herself from persons who have reaped benefit by her husband's prescriptions several of these consist of valuable trinkets with which on days of ceremony she decks herself forth to the best advantage in the simple dress of the country  The family sit down to table regularly at twelve o'clock there are always some strangers of the party consisting not only of a certain number of persons who are under the doctor's care but of travellers like ourselves who are led hither by motives of mere curiosity When the weather is fine and their guests more numerous than usual dinner is served out of doors in an open shed that looks upon one side of the mountain and the adjacent country with a distant view of the glaciers beyond the lake of Thun Yesterday some peasants whom the doctor had invited formed part of our company after dinner he gave some money to those that sate near him and ordered one of his granddaughters to distribute  his bounty to the others The benevolence of the old man his gaiety and goodhumour the chearfulness of his family the gratitude of the poor peasants the beauty of the prospect and the fineness of the weather formed all together the most agreeable and delightful scenes I ever beheld and I do not remember in my whole life to have partaken of any meal with a more sensible and heartfelt satisfaction  This singular man is very often employed in giving his advice from eight in the morning till six in the evening with no other intermission than during the time he is at table His drugs are of the best kind for he collects the simples as well as distills them himself His house like those of the peasants is constructed of wood and though always full of people is remarkably neat and clean In short every thing about him has the appearance of the pleasing simplicity of former ages  I had almost forgotten to tell you that I consulted him this morning myself and assuredly I have reason to be highly satisfied with his prescription for he told me I was in such good health that the  only advice he had to give me was  "to eat and drink well to dance be merry and take moderate exercise"  It is now Langenau fair and the village is crowded with the neighbouring peasants Great numbers of the men have long beards and many of them cover their heads with a woman's straw hat extremely broad which gives them a very grotesque appearance their dress is chiefly a coarse brown cloth jacket without sleeves with large puffed breeches of ticking The women wear their hair plaited behind in tresses with the riband hanging down below the waist a flat plain straw hat which is very becoming a red or brown cloth jacket without sleeves a black or blue petticoat bordered with red and scarcely reaching below the knees red stockings with black clocks and no heels to their shoes their shifts fastened close round the throat by a black collar with red ornaments the better sort have chains of silver between the shoulders brought round under each arm and fastened beneath the bosom the ends hanging down with some silver ornaments  I am so charmed with the situation of  this village the chearfulness and singularity of this rustic and agreeable family and the uncommon character of the humane doctor that I could with pleasure continue here some days more but I am pressed for time and have a long journey before me  I am c  LETTER XXXVI  Geneva  Sept  I TOOK leave of my friends at Langenau in order to proceed to Avignon where I am going to pay a visit to the  Abbé de Sade  author of the interesting memoirs of the life of Petrarch A respectable and knowing old gentleman of Soleure one of the members of their sovereign council with whom I had the good fortune to fall into acquaintance during my stay at the doctor's offered me a place in his carriage to Berne and as my principal object in travelling is to acquire all the useful intelligence I can by any means obtain I very gladly embraced this opportunity of  leading my worthy and wellinformed companion into a conversation not only concerning the government of Soleure in particular but in relation also to Swisserland in general I found him exceedingly welldisposed to give me all possible satisfaction in answer to the several questions he very obligingly allowed me to propose to him  In the afternoon I saw a most curious collection in natural history belonging to Mr Springling of Berne it consisted of about specimens in fine preservation of birds both local and migratory that are found in Swisserland Amongst others I observed the common eagle the golden vulture the emberiza nivalis of Linnaeus and the snow hen whose feathers in winter are perfectly white and in summer spotted  The next day I repassed through Morat and Avenches and slept at Payerne a town in the canton of Berne which enjoys considerable privileges Upon the bridge over the Broye is an antient Roman inscription as I was endeavouring to decypher it a plainlooking man accosted me in a very solemn tone of voice  and said he had often tried to make out the inscription and though he could read very well and had a smattering in Latin he could never make any thing of it  "For" added he "what can be the meaning of N and I and O and all those great letters which seem to have no connection with each other Give me a page of plain Latin and I know what I am about I will translate it you from the beginning to the end but for these Ns Is and Os take my word for it notwithstanding all your pains you will never be a jot the wiser"  However as I did not seem disposed to follow his advice but continued decyphering the inscription which was by no means a difficult task he appeared astonished at my obstinacy and left me with an apparent air of pity to my hopeless fortune  Moudon is an handsome town the principal burgh of a bailliage of the same name and formerly the capital of all that part of the Pays de Vaud which belonged to the Duke of Savoy It was also the ordinary residence of his chief bailiff and the place where the assembly of the states  were accustomed to meet at present it contains nothing remarkable The bailiff appointed by the sovereign council of Berne resides in the castle of Lucens built upon the summit of a mountain in a situation exceedingly picturesque This castle formerly belonged to the bishops of Lausanne and was one of their favourite seats before the reformation was introduced into these parts  At Lausanne I had proposed to cross the Lake of Geneva to Meillerie intending to go in quest of that romantic spot described by St Preux in Rousseau's Eloise and which a countryman of ours assured me he had discovered from thence I meant to coast along the southern side of the lake and touch upon the several towns of Chablais Every thing was prepared for this expedition but unfortunately a sudden change of weather put an end to these amusing projects no waterman would undertake to carry me The lake indeed was vehemently agitated with a most violent storm similar to that which is described in the letter I have mentioned and as I had no Julia to induce me to hazard the danger  I felt no inclination to risk it for the sake of satisfying a mere fanciful curiosity Accordingly I made the best of my way by land to Crassi through the same beautiful variety of country I had passed before and which cannot be reviewed too often  In my way to Geneva the day following I dined with an Englishman at Genthoud where I expected to have had the permission of waiting upon Mr Bonnet the celebrated naturalist to whom I was very ambitious of being known Unfortunately however his wife was taken ill and I was debarred the great satisfaction I had proposed to myself of seeing and conversing with so deservedly eminent a philosopher whose indefatigable industry in searching into the several phaenomena of nature is equalled only by his ingenuity in explaining them  The town of Geneva lies upon the narrowest part of the extremity of the lake where the Rhone issues out in two large and rapid streams which soon afterwards unite That river divides the town into two unequal parts receives the muddy Arve in its course and flows  through part of France into the Mediterranean  Here  its waters are of a most beautiful transparent green like those of the Rhine when it flows from the lake of Constance The adjacent country is uncommonly picturesque and I could not sufficiently admire the magnificent views it exhibits the several objects which composed this enchanting prospect were the town the lake the numerous hills and mountains particularly the Saleve and the Mole rising suddenly from the plain in a wonderful variety of fantastic forms backed by the glaciers of Savoy with their frozen tops glistening in the sun and the majestic Mont Blanc lifting up its head far above the rest  The town which lies partly in the plain upon the borders of the lake and partly upon a gentle ascent is irregularly built the houses are high and most of those which stand in the trading part of the city have arcades of wood which are carried up to their tops These arcades which are supported by pillars obstruct the streets and give them a gloomy appearance but they are useful to the inhabitants in protecting them from the  sun and the rain Geneva is by far the most populous town in Swisserland for Zuric which comes next to it in respect of population contains scarcely thirteen thousand souls whereas the inhabitants of this place amount to twentyfour thousand This superiority is undoubtedly owing to the greater industry and activity of the inhabitants to its more extensive commerce to the facility of purchasing the burghership and to the privileges which government allows to all foreigners who settle here The members of this city are distinguished into citizens and burghesses inhabitants and natives The citizens and burghesses are alone admitted to a share in the government the  inhabitants  are strangers who are allowed to settle in the town with certain privileges and the  natives  are the sons of those inhabitants who possess certain additional advantages The two last classes form a large majority of the people  The liberal policy of this government in receiving strangers and conferring the burghership is the more remarkable as it is contrary to the spirit of most of the other states of Swisserland It is here  indeed more necessary the territory of this republic being so exceedingly small that its very existence depends upon the number and industry of the people for exclusive of the inhabitants of the town there are scarcely sixteen thousand souls in the whole district of the Genevois  To a man of letters Geneva is particularly interesting as every branch of science is here cultivated in the most advantageous manner learning is divested of pedantry and philosophy united with a knowledge of the world The pleasures of society are here mixed with the pursuits of literature and elegance and urbanity give a zest to the profoundest disquisitions Nor are letters confined in this city merely to those who engage in them as a profession or to those whose fortune and leisure enable them to follow where genius leads and enter into a studious life by voluntary choice even the lower class of people are exceedingly well informed and there is no city in Europe where learning is so universally diffused among the inhabitants I have had great satisfaction in conversing with several of the shopkeepers upon topics both of  literature and politics and was astonished to find in this class of men so uncommon a share of knowledge But the wonder ceases when we are told that they have all of them received an excellent education at the public academy where the children of the inhabitants are taught under the inspection of the magistrates and at the expence of government  There is one circumstance in this seminary which particularly contributes to the exciting of the industry and emulation of the students prizes are annually distributed to those who have distinguished themselves in each class These rewards consist of small medals and they are conferred with such solemnity as cannot fail of producing great effect A yearly meeting is held at the cathedral of all the magistrates professors and principal inhabitants of the town when the first syndic himself distributes in the most public manner the several honorary retributions to those who have deserved them I met this morning one of the scholars and seeing his medal asked him what it meant  "Je la porte" replied the little man scarce eight years old  "parce que j'ai fait mon devoir"  I wanted no stronger proof to convince me of the beneficial influence upon young minds of these encouraging and judicious distinctions than appeared from the sprightly specimen before me  The inhabitants enjoy the advantage also of having free access to the public library and by this privilege they not only retain but improve that general tincture of learning which they imbibe in their early youth when I visited this library it happened to be crowded with students who were returning the books they had borrowed and demanding others As I passed only an hour in this room I am ill qualified to give you a just idea of its contents I requested however the librarian to point out to me what was most worthy of particular notice Accordingly among other books and manuscripts he shewed me several folio volumes containing letters and other writings of Calvin which have never been published  Although Zuingle Aecolampadius and Haller had reformed the greatest part of Swisserland some years before Calvin  made his appearance at Geneva yet the latter as Voltaire justly observes has given his name to the sectaries of the reformed religion in the same manner as the new continent took its appellation from Americus Vespasius although the original discovery was made by Columbus Neither was Calvin indeed the first reformer even of Geneva but as he gave additional strength and solidity to the new establishment and laid the foundation of that ecclesiastical form of government which has ever since been invariably oserved he totally eclipsed the fame of his friend William Farel who scattered the first seeds of reformation which the other brought to maturity In truth so great was the ascendancy which this extraordinary man although a stranger in Geneva acquired over the citizens that he possessed no inconsiderable influence even in civil matters and bore a large share in settling the political constitution of the republic But his care and attention was not wholly confined to ecclesiastical and political concerns he promoted to the utmost of his power the cultivation of the liberal  arts and sciences and the study of elegant literature To this end as well as for the encouraging of theological erudition he prevailed upon the government of Geneva to establish a public academy In this new seminary himself together with his colleagues eminent for their superior knowledge read lectures with such uncommon reputation and success that the youth from all quarters flocked to receive the benefit of them and it has sent forth from its bosom men of the greatest distinction for their learning and abilities  There is such a striking splendor in the brighter parts of this disinterested and celebrated reformer's character that renders one at the first glance almost insensible of those dark spots in it which have so justly sullied its glory But when one reflects a moment on the asperity the arrogance the presumptuous opiniatrety of his temper and conduct and above all on his cruel persecution of his former friend the unhappy Servetus one laments with abhorrence the mortifying instance this famous man exhibited that the noblest qualities sometimes mix with the basest  in the composition of human nature With regard however to his intolerant principles it must be acknowledged that the same uncharitable spirit prevailed also among some others of the most celebrated reformers who seemed to think by a strange inconsistency and unaccountable blindness not only to the genius but to the clearest precepts of the gospel that persecution for conscience sake was unchristian in every ecclesiastical establishment except their own This absurd and dangerous opinion gave great advantage to their adversaries of the papal hierarchy for it is obvious to the meanest understanding that if persecution is justifiable in any particular church it must be so universally  The republic of Geneva is however at present the most tolerating of all the reformed states of Swisserland being the only government in this country which permits the Lutheran religion to be publicly exercised In this respect the clergy no less wisely than suitably to the spirit as well as the letter of the Christian revelation have renounced the principles of their great patriarch Calvin for although  they still hold that able reformer in high veneration yet they know how to distinguish his virtues from his defects and to admire the one without being blindly partial to the other  I am c  LETTER XXXVII  October  I Write to you a third time from Geneva desirous of gaining as much information concerning its history and the nature of its government as possible I visited this town again in my return from Avignon  See the beginning of the former letter  into Swisserland I will now therefore endeavour to throw together from my notes relating to the subject all that appears worth communicating to you premising at the same time that I find them such an indigested mass as to have reason to fear I shall not be able to reduce them into so clear an order as not to stand much in need of your candour when you peruse the following observations  The town of Geneva and its territory were formerly united to the German empire under the successors of Charlemain but as the power of the emperors feeble even in Germany was still weaker in the frontier provinces the bishops of Geneva like several other great vassals of the empire gradually acquired very considerable authority over the city and its domains which the emperors had no other means of counterbalancing than by encreasing the liberties of the people During these times of confusion constant disputes subsisted between the bishops and the counts of the Genevois for the latter although at their first institution merely officers of the emperor and considered as vassals of the bishops yet they claimed and asserted a right to the exclusive administration of justice The citizens took advantage of these quarrels and by siding occasionally with each party obtained an extension of their privileges from both  But the house of Savoy having purchased the county of the Genevois and succeeded to all the prerogatives of the counts with additional power the bishops  and the people firmly united together in order to oppose the encroachments of the former which were no less prejudicial to the authority of the one than to the liberties of the others During this period the respective pretensions of the counts the bishops and the citizens were so various as to form a government equally singular and complicated This harmony however between the bishops and citizens was at length broken by the artful management of the counts of Savoy who had the address to procure the episcopal see for their brothers and even for their illegitimate children By these methods their power in the city became so enlarged that towards the commencement of the sixteenth century Charles III duke of Savoy although the form of the government was entirely republican obtained an almost absolute authority over the citizens and he exercised it in the most unjust and arbitrary manner Hence arose perpetual struggles between the duke and the citizens the latter continually opposing either by open violence or secret measures his tyrannical usurpation thus  two parties were formed the zealots for liberty were called  eidgenossen  or confederates while the partisans of the duke were branded with the appellation of  mammelucs  or slaves  The treaty of alliance which the town entered into with Berne and Fribourg in may be considered as the true aera of its liberty and independence for not long after the duke was despoiled of his authority the bishop driven from the city a republican form of government firmly established and the reformation introduced From this time Charles and his successors waged incessant war against the town but his hostilities were rendered ineffectual by the intrepid bravery of the citizens and the assistance of the canton of Berne  In Geneva entered into a treaty of perpetual alliance with Zuric and Berne Fribourg having renounced their alliance when the town embraced the reformation by which treaty it is allied with the Swiss cantons  The last attempt of the house of Savoy against Geneva was in when Charles Emanuel treacherously attacked  the town during a profound peace Two hundred of his soldiers scaled the walls in the night when the inhabitants were reposed in unsuspecting security but being timely discovered they were repulsed by the desperate valour of a few citizens who gloriously sacrificed their lives in defence of the liberties of their country In memory of this event an inscription is fixed upon the townhouse and some of the scalingladders which the enemy made use of to enter the town are preserved in the arsenal This perfidy occasioned a war which was terminated the year following by a solemn treaty since which uninterrupted peace has been maintained between the house of Savoy and Geneva but it was not till that the king of Sardinia acknowledged by a formal act the independence of this republic  No sooner was peace concluded with the house of Savoy than the flames of internal discord so apt to kindle in popular governments and which had been smothered by their common danger from a foreign enemy began to appear Accordingly during the greatest part of the  last century to the present period the history of Geneva contains little more than a narrative of contentions between the aristocratical and the popular party These mutual struggles have occasionally been exerted with so much violence and animosity as to have threatened for a moment a total revolution in the state but happily however they have always been compromised without producing any fatal effects  About the beginning of the present century the power of the council of two hundred was become almost absolute In order to restrain their authority the popular party in procured a law by which it was enacted that every five years a general council of all the citizens and burghers should be holden to deliberate upon the affairs of the republic Agreeably to this law a general assembly was convened in and the very first act exerted by the people in this their collective capacity was the total abolition of the abovementioned ordinance An event of so singular a nature can hardly be accounted for upon the general principle of p pular fickleness and inconsistency  accordingly Rousseau in his  Lettres ecrites de la Montagne  imputes it to the artifices of the magistrates and to the equivocal terms marked upon the billets then in use For the question proposed to the people being  "Whether the opinion of the councils for abolishing the periodical general assemblies should pass into a law"  the words employed on the billets delivered for that purpose were  approbation rejection  so that whichever side was taken it came to the same point If the billet of  approbation  were chosen the opinion of the councils which rejected the periodical assembly was approved if that of  rejection  then the periodical assembly was rejected of course Accordingly several of the citizens afterwards complained that they had been deceived as they never meant to reject the general assembly but only the opinion of the councils  Miscellaneous Works of Rousseau Vol iv p    In consequence of this extraordinary repeal the power of the aristocracy continued encreasing till within these few years when the citizens by a singular conjunction of favourable circumstances joined to an uncommon spirit of union  and perseverance have procured several changes to be made in the constitution of Geneva by which the authority of the magistrates has been limited and the privileges of the people have been enlarged Happy if they know where to stop lest continuing to extend the bounds of their own prerogatives they shake the foundations of civil government by too much restraining the power of the magistrates  The present constitution of Geneva may be considered as a mean between that of the other aristocratical and popular cantons of Swisserland more democratical than any of the former inasmuch as the sovereign and legislative authority entirely resides in the general assembly of the citizens and burghers and more aristocratical than the latter because the powers vested in the great and little councils are very considerable  The members of the senate or little council of twentyfive enjoy in their corporate capacity several prerogatives almost as great as those which are possessed by that of the most aristocratical states They nominate half the members  of the great council the principal magistrates are taken from their body they convoke the great council and the general assembly of the citizens and burghers they previously deliberate upon every question which is to be brought into the great council and from thence into the general assembly in other words in them is lodged the power of proposing consequently as every act must originate from them no law can pass without their approbation In this senate is vested also the chief executive power the administration of the finances and to a certain degree jurisdiction in civil and criminal causes They nominate likewise to most of the smaller posts of government and enjoy the sole privilege of conferring burghership They compose moreover in conjunction with thirtyfive members of their own choosing the secret council which never assembles but by their convoking and only upon extraordinary occasions  These considerable prerogatives however are counterbalanced as well by the privileges of the great council as by the franchises of the general assembly The  prerogatives of the former consist in choosing the members of the senate from their own body in receiving appeals in all causes above a certain value in pardoning criminals in disposing of the most important charges of government those excepted which are conferred by the general assembly and in approving or rejecting whatever is proposed by the senate to be laid before the people  The sovereign council or general assembly of the people is composed of the citizens and burghers of the town their number in general amounts to about but it is seldom that more than convene the remainder being either settled in foreign countries or are usually absent I ought to have explained to you sooner the distinction between  citizens  and  burghers  the latter are either the sons of citizens or burghers  The children of those who are employed in foreign countries in the service of the state although born out of Geneva are entitled to all the privileges of citizens  born out of Geneva or have obtained the burghership by purchase the former are the sons of citizens or burghers born within the town of Geneva The burghers  may be chosen into the council of two hundred but the citizens can alone enter into the senate and possess the charges appropriated to that body  The general assembly meets twice a year chooses the principal magistrates assents to or rejects the laws and regulations proposed by the councils imposes taxes contracts alliances declares war or peace and nominates one half of the members of the great council All questions that come before them are decided by the majority of voices and each member delivers his vote without having the liberty of debating The restriction is certainly reasonable for in a popular assembly like this of Geneva composed of citizens the meanest of whom is well versed in the constitution of the commonwealth and where the people in general have a strong propensity to enter into political discussions if every voter were permitted to support and enforce his opinion by argument there would be no end of debate and the whole time would be consumed in petulant declamation  But the principal check to the power  of the little council arises from the method of electing the syndics and from the right of  representation  With respect to the former the four syndics or chiefs of the republic are chosen annually out of the little council by the general assembly and there must be an interval of three years before the same members can be again elected The usual mode of election is as followsThe little council nominate eight of their members for candidates who must be approved by the great council and out of these eight the general assembly choose the four syndics They have it in their power however not only to reject these eight proposed candidates but also all the other members of the senate successively and in that case four members are taken from the great council and proposed to the general assembly If these are appointed syndics they immediately become members of the senate and an equal number of that body are at the same time degraded and retire into the great council No instance however has yet occurred of the general assembly having exerted  this power of expelling four members from the senate  Since the above was written I have been informed that the citizens and burghers expelled four members from the senate at the election of magistrates for the year    With respect to the other restraint I mentioned upon the power of the little council viz the right of  representation  every citizen or burgher either singly or in a body has the privilege of applying to the senate in order to procure some new regulation or of remonstrating against any act of the magistracy These representations have proved one of the principal means perhaps of securing the liberties of the people from the respective encroachments of the two councils as they have frequently prevented the magistrates from stretching their authority to the same arbitrary extent that has been practised in some of the other commonwealths of Swisserland The magistrates are obliged to give an explicit answer to these representations for if the first is not considered as satisfactory a second remonstrance is presented According to the nature and importance of the complaint the representation is made by a  greater or less number of citizens and it has sometimes happened that each remonstrance has been accompanied by several hundred in different bodies  The salaries of the several magistrates are so inconsiderable as not to offer any temptation on the side of pecuniary emolument a sense of honour a spirit of ambition the desire of serving their country together with that personal credit which is derived from exercising any office in the administration are the principal motives which actuate the candidates to solicit a share in the magistracy Accordingly the public posts are generally filled with men of the first abilities and of the most respectable characters The revenues of government at the highest calculation scarcely amount to pounds a year a sum however which by a wellregulated oeconomy is more than sufficient to defray the current expences so that this republic is enabled to provide for the security of its subjects from an income which some individuals both in England and France squander in vain pomp and vicious dissipation  It is very remarkable that in a republic  so free as this of Geneva and where the true principles of liberty are so well and so generally understood there should be no precise code of penal laws for although the form of the process is settled with great precision yet the trial of the criminal is private and the punishment left to the arbitrary decision of the magistrate Nor are the franchises of the people ascertained with that accuracy one might well have expected Indeed under Ademar Fabri bishop of Geneva in the fourteenth century a certain number of political regulations both civil and criminal together with several particular customs and liberties were drawn up in form and the bishop took an oath to observe them These statutes if they may be so called were also confirmed by Amadeus VIII duke of Savoy In all cases of controversy the people appeal to this code but it is not only compiled in a very inaccurate and confused manner but the magistrates refuse to be governed by it because it was published before the independence of the republic was confirmed With respect to the several laws which have since been enacted in the general  assembly some few of them indeed are printed and in the hands of the public but the rest remain in the archives of the senate for there being no particular secretary belonging to the general assembly all the laws which they pass are taken down by the secretary to the senate so that the latter are the sole depositaries of those edicts which ought to be laid open to the inspection of the whole community The people have repeatedly demanded a precise code of municipal and penal laws so express and determinate that nothing may be left to the arbitrary decision of the magistrate but the senate has always found means of evading this very reasonable and just requisition  Their code of civil law is the most perfect part of this constitution all matters concerning commerce are well regulated by it and private property securely guarded It is unnecessary to trouble you with a particular detail of the sumptuary laws they are much the same as those in most of the other states of Swisserland where restrictions of that kind are enforced But there is one law relating to bankrupts too singularly severe not to be mentioned If a member of either  council becomes a bankrupt he is immediately degraded and from that moment is rendered incapable of holding any post under government until he shall have discharged all the just demands of his creditors even his children are subjected to the same disgrace and no citizen can exercise any public employment whatsoever while the debts of his father remain unpaid  In this city as in all the other principal towns of Swisserland a public granary is established Magazines of this kind are useful in all states but are more particularly necessary in so populous a place as Geneva which if the neighbouring powers were to prohibit the exportation of corn into the territory of the republic might be exposed to all the horrors of a general famine The benefit of this institution has been frequently experienced in times of scarcity and all authors who have published observations upon the government of Geneva have agreed in mentioning it with the praises it deserves But they have overlooked one great defect in its regulation and which is not imputable to the management of those public granaries which are  established in Berne and Zuric The  chamber of corn  as it is here called is a committee from the great council of two hundred empowered to supply the granary with that commodity at the expence of government This corn is dried by means of machines well contrived for that purpose retailed out to the innkeepers and bakers a considerable profit accrues to government and there is always in case of necessity a sufficient quantity in reserve to support the inhabitants during a year and an half Thus far all is right but then the burden of this institution falls upon the poor For as the directors buy the corn at the cheapest rate retail that part of it which has been kept the longest and vend it at an higher price than it is sold in the neighbouring territories the bakers must consequently sell their bread dearer and not of so good a quality as that which may be purchased on the frontiers of Savoy But the importation of bread is strictly prohibited those families therefore who can afford it lay in a provision of corn for their own use while the poorer sort suffer by being obliged to purchase at an advanced price their daily  provision from the bakers Perhaps however the government is not sufficiently rich to put their granary upon the same footing with those of Berne and Zuric by sacrificing the profit arising from the chamber of corn  The town is strongly fortified on the side of Savoy and a garrison of about nine hundred men constantly maintained but these fortifications and this garrison are only sufficient to guard them from any sudden attack they could not defend them long against a regular siege The great security of the republic consists in its alliance with the Swiss cantons by means of Zuric and Berne and as it is the interest both of the king of France and the king of Sardinia to keep well with the Swiss and to preserve the independence of Geneva it derives its greatest security from what in some cases would be its greatest danger namely that its territory borders upon the dominions of such powerful neighbours  This republic is the only commonwealth in Swisserland that has no regular companies in any foreign service wisely prohibiting the enlisting of mercenaries in every part of its territory  I am c  LETTER XXXVIII  Bienne  October  THE small territory of Bienne containing scarcely six thousand inhabitants lies between the lake and a chain of the Jura mountains it is surrounded by the cantons of Berne and Soleure the bishoprick of Basil and the principality of Neuchatel The town is situated at the foot of the chain abovementioned and at a little distance from the lake which is here about nine miles in length and four in breadth the borders are pleasing and picturesque and the town of Nidau forms a very beautiful object upon its eastern side In the midst of the lake is an island belonging to the canton of Berne in which the persecuted Rousseau resided some months after he had renounced all the rights of a citizen of Geneva and until the government of Basil compelled him to quit their territory I cannot forbear observing upon this occasion that the fate of this very ingenious philosopher seems to have been no less singular than his  doctrine for after having been driven out of two republics he found an asylum in the capital of an absolute government and what is more extraordinary of that very government too which is supposed to have instigated the magistrates of Geneva to exert an act of arbitrary power against him which in its consequence produced a diminution of their own authority  The bishop of Basil is the sovereign of this little state his power formerly was considerable but at present is exceedingly limited Indeed the constitution of Bienne is of so very peculiar a nature that I know not well by what name to distinguish it it cannot properly be called either a limited monarchy or an independent republic it seems rather to be a certain mixed government partaking somewhat of both  The bishop of Basil or the prince of Porentru as he is called by the protestant cantons receives upon his promotion to the bishoprick the homage of the citizens and militia of this town with all the apparent ceremonials of the most absolute submission but at the same time  he confirms in the strongest manner all their privileges and franchises He is represented by a mayor of his own appointing whose power and office consist in convoking and presiding in the little council as the chief court of justice in collecting the suffrages and declaring the sentence but without giving any vote himself And although justice is carried on and executed in the name of the prince yet neither himself nor the mayor has the prerogative of pardoning criminals or of mitigating the sentence All causes civil as well as criminal are brought before this council in the first instance and in the more important ones an appeal lies to the sovereign council in both cases each party chooses a member of the council to act as his advocate which office the member is obliged to discharge without fee or recompence To this species of lawyers Martial's severe imputation that  iras verba locant  is by no means applicable it must be owned however that they are of a kind extremely uncommon  The sovereign's revenue amounts only to about £ a year but mean as his civil  list is it is still more considerable than his authority for he does not possess the least share of the administration The regency of the town is jointly vested in the great and little councils the former in which the legislative power resides consists of forty members and the latter in which the executive is lodged is composed of twentyfour the members of each must be married men Both these councils elect their respective members and so far the constitution is entirely aristocratical The burgomaster is chief of the regency is chosen by the two councils and presides at their meetings whenever they are assembled together in their joint capacity He continues in his office during life in which however he must be confirmed annually by the two councils as are also the several magistrates in their respective posts The salaries annexed to these offices are exceedingly moderate and indeed the general expences of the government are so very small that in proportion to them its revenues may well be considered as abundantly ample  It appears therefore that this protestant republic notwithstanding the sovereignty  of its catholic bishop enjoys in the fullest extent the power of imposing taxes contracting alliances declaring war and peace and in short of exercising every other act of absolute and independent legislation This singular constitution is guarantied by Berne Fribourg and Soleure with whom the town is closely allied in consequence of which it becomes a member of the Helvetic confederacy And what is somewhat remarkable this alliance between those cantons and the town of Bienne is of a superior nature to that of the same cantons with the bishop of Basil for the town enjoys the right of sending deputies to every general diet ordinary and extraordinary whereas the bishop is not allowed the same privilege  The language of the country is a kind of provincial German but as the territory borders upon the principality of Neuchatel the inhabitants speak also a kind of corrupted French They are a very active and industrious people several manufactures are established in the town which considering its size carries on a large trade  I have often had occasion to observe to you that the common people of Swisserland are far more intelligent than the same rank of men in any other country Accordingly I invited my landlord last night to sup with me and I found him by no means disposed to be a silent guest He gave me a long account of the ceremony that was lately performed here when the citizens did homage to their new bishop I was pleased to hear him expatiate with all the enthusiasm of national pride upon the beauty and grandeur of the scene the magnificence of the procession the number of spectators as well strangers as natives who were assembled together with the entertainments and the balls that were given upon that occasion By the lofty terms in which he spoke of this procession you would have thought at least that he had been describing the coronation of the emperor of Germany or the king of France and in truth to an inhabitant of Bienne whose government is administered without the least degree of external pomp and where luxury has not yet made any progress the ceremony  must necessarily have appeared a very striking spectacle My host's narrative recalled to my remembrance the accounts of those ancient feudal sovereignties when the great vassals of the crown did homage to their liege lord and while in  terms  they promised him unlimited obedience maintained in  fact  every essential of independence  I have just been amusing myself in some pleasant walks that lie by the side of the lake which is here prettily skirted with country houses In my way I passed over a plain between the town and the lake which the sovereign council by a kind of agrarian law that does honour to the legislature allotted long ago in distinct portions to each burgher for his own particular use it is entirely laid out in little neat kitchengardens The general government indeed of this miniature state is well administred It has lately adopted the liberal policy of conferring the burghership at an easy rate a wise regulation which cannot fail of encreasing the population of the town and extending its commerce  I know your sentiments much too well my dear sir to apologize for calling your  attention in the present instance as in some others to these diminutive commonwealths The various modifications of government into which civil society is divided is a speculation that will always afford matter both of entertainment and reflection to a philosophic mind and I am persuaded that you consider the meanest spot of this globe consecrated by liberty to be an object worthy not only of your curiosity but your veneration  I am c  LETTER XXXIX  Soleure  October  THE road from Bienne to Soleure lies through a rich and cultivated valley enclosed within the Jura mountains The town is pleasantly situated upon the Aar which here expands its banks and opens into a broad and fine river flowing at the foot of some high and steep hills the circumjacent country is exceedingly pleasing and diversified  I will not exert the privilege of a traveller and tell you what some extravagant  antiquarians do not scruple to assert that Soleure was built by the patriarch Abraham but you will have no difficulty perhaps in believing what others maintain that it was one of the twelve towns which were destroyed upon the emigration of the original inhabitants into Gaul But at what time and upon what occasion soever its destruction happened it appears probable from a great number of inscriptions medals and other antiquities that have been found in the neighbourhood that it was repeopled by a Roman colony and certainly was a Roman fortification as its antient appellation  Castrum Salodurense  necessarily implies  Little more of its history is known during that period of ignorance and barbarism which succeeded the downfall of the Roman empire than that it was sacked and destroyed by those northern nations who overran the greatest parts of Europe From the time of its reestablishment until its admission into the Helvetic confederacy in its state was similar to that of many other imperial towns which acquired a gradual accession of  territory and after various struggles finally secured to themselves an absolute independence  The canton of Soleure is nearly twelve leagues in length and seven in its greatest breadth stretching partly through the plain and partly along the ridges of the Jura Its population may amount to between forty and fifty thousand souls of which the capital contains about five thousand all the inhabitants of the canton are catholics  The government is aristocratical upon much the same plan as that of Lucerne and of Fribourg the patrician families are in possession of all the public employments The sovereign council consists of an hundred and twenty members in which the senate or council of thirtyfive is comprised the latter consists of two advoyers eleven altraths or senior counsellors and twentytwo jungraths or junior counsellors Upon the death of one of the altraths the senior of the jungraths succeeds to his place and the vacancy occasioned by that removal is filled up by the eleven altraths out of the great council It is from the altraths  that the four principal magistrates are chosen namely the two advoyers the banneret and the treasurer and upon the death of one of the advoyers the banneret succeeds to his place of course after having gone through the formality of being nominated by the general assembly of the burghers When a vacancy happens in the great council it is supplied by the eleven altraths who always choose the new member from the same tribe or  company  of the citizens to which the last member belonged The whole body of burghers assemble every year and confirm the advoyers and the banneret in their respective offices at the same time the twentytwo jungraths confirm the eleven altraths who in their turn confirm in the same manner the former But all these several confirmations are matters of mere formality No person can be elected into the great council before he has attained the age of twenty nor into the senate sooner than twentyfour  Excepting the treasurer who is elected by the sovereign council and the advoyers and banneret who are chosen by the  burghers all the other public employments are at the disposal of the senate which body has jurisdiction likewise in all civil and criminal causes without appeal The revenues of this government and the stipends of the numerous places held under it are the circumstances of these states considered by no means small so that the chief families derive from the several posts they possess very profitable emoluments  The soil of this canton is exceedingly fertile and those districts which lie within the Jura abound in excellent pastures but there is a great want of hands for all the purposes of agriculture and the defect sensibly encreases Nevertheless the ground is so particularly favourable to corn that a third part of the yearly produce may be exported without the least detriment to the public The trade both of the town and of the canton is of little value although they are very commodiously situated for carrying on an extensive commerce  The French embassador to the Helvetic body resides in this town and distributes from hence those annual pensions or  subsidies which the king his master has stipulated by treaty to pay the catholic cantons they amount to about pounds a year Louis XI was the first French monarch who employed Swiss troops in his service and granted subsidies to the states These have since been considerably augmented by his successors and the perpetual alliance which Francis I concluded with the Swiss cantons soon after the battle of Marignano is considered as the basis of every subsequent treaty that has been made between the two contracting powers Several of the successors of that king derived considerable advantages from the Swiss infantry in their service they aided Henry IV in establishing himself upon the throne of his ancestors and assisted both Louis XIII and his son in the several wars in which they were engaged No troops indeed have ever been more justly distinguished for their fidelity their valour and the excellence of their discipline  The last general alliance between France and the whole Helvetic union was concluded by Louis the XIVth in and to remain in force during  the joint lives of that monarch and his son the dauphin and for eight years after the death of either of them Towards the end of his reign when that monarch on account of his son's death proposed to renew the alliance in his and his successor's name the protestant cantons refused their consent accordingly it was concluded only with the catholic cantons and the republic of the Vallais  This alliance differed from the former treaties in some very essential articles particularly as it stipulatedthat in case the kingdom of France should be invaded the Swiss republics in question should permit an additional levy to be raised at his majesty's expence not exceeding sixteen thousand men that in case the Helvetic body or any particular canton should be attacked by a foreign power the king engaged to assist them with as many forces as should be thought necessary and finally that if any dissensions should arise between the contracting cantons his majesty should at the request of the aggrieved party try all gentle methods of bringing about a reconciliation but if these should fail the king agreed  both in his own name and in that of his successor to compel the aggressor to abide by the treaties contracted between the cantons and their allies This last article seemed in some measure to authorize the interference of the king of France with the politics of Swisserland and in that view appeared dangerous to many of the Swiss and inconsistent with that absolute independence which they had hitherto prized above all other advantages  The court of France is at present endeavouring to persuade the protestant cantons to accede to the alliance in order that a general treaty may be renewed and it is expected that a diet will soon be holden at Soleure  The alliance in question was actually concluded at Soleure in May between the king of France on one side and the thirteen cantons and their allies on the other to continue in force during fifty years By this treaty it is agreed that in case the kingdom of France should be invaded the cantons and their allies are to furnish an additional levy of six thousand men and if the Swiss cantons or any of their allies are attacked the king if required engages to send to them at his own expence such succours as may be thought necessary  That article of the treaty concluded with the catholic cantons in which related to the mediation of the king of France in case of any disputes arising between the thirteen cantons is very properly and wisely omitted  Before this alliance none of the protestant states of Swisserland ever received any pensions from France but by the sixteenth article the protestants of Glaris and Appenzel and the town of Bienne have agreed to accept  les argents de paix et d'alliance  as these subsidies are here called  for that purpose  I am c  LETTER XL  Basil  November  THE road from Soleure to this town lies through the midst of the Jura mountains along the vale of Balstal remarkable for its richness and fertility and though the country in general is exceedingly romantic and rocky yet in many places it is highly cultivated  I turned a little out of the direct way to this place in order to view the ruins of  Augusta Rauricorum  formerly a large town under the dominion of the Romans now a small village in the canton of Basil  close to the Rhine Its ancient remains are very inconsiderable consisting of a few pillars of marble still standing and some scattered fragments of others together with a kind of semicircular range of walls upon a rising ground the greatest part of which has tumbled down and is almost entirely overgrown with brushwood From the present appearance of the lastmentioned ruins I should hardly have guessed that they once composed part of a theatre capable of containing above twelve thousand spectators But the celebrated Schaefflin has given in his  Alsatia Illustrata  a particular description of this theatre and its dimensions as also of the temple to which the marble columns I mentioned formerly belonged Besides these there are likewise the remains of some small aqueducts which conveyed water to the town from the distance of above twelve miles but none of these relics of antiquity have any thing so very remarkable in them as to merit the trouble of a particular visit  The peasants in turning up the ground where these ruins are situated frequently find medals of the Roman emperors from  Augustus to Constantine and are become by repeated experience able to distinguish with some degree of precision those that are rare from the more common ones I purchased of a labourer two medals which he had just found a Trajan and an Albinus and though the former was by far the most perfect yet he made me pay three times as much for the latter because he had never seen it he said before  I arrived here the day before yesterday and as I had good reason to be assured about twelve at noon but was much surprized to find that all the clocks in the town agreed to make me suppose I was mistaken and actually struck one the fact is that every one of them go an hour faster than those of the rest of Europe Different reasons have been assigned for this singularity some assert that it was first practised during the council of Basil in order to assemble the cardinals and bishops the earlier who being a very lazy and indolent set of mortals always came too late Others tell you that a conspiracy being formed to enter the town at midnight and to assassinate the magistrates one of the  burgomasters who had notice of the design put the town clock an hour forwards by which means the conspirators imagining they had missed the appointed time retired and that the clocks are still kept forwards as a perpetual memorial of this happy deliverance But there is a third reason given for this strange custom which seems by far the most probable It is well known that the choirs of cathedrals and churches are constructed towards the east that of Basil declines somewhat from this direction and the sundial which is placed upon the outside of the choir and by which the town clock is always regulated partakes of this declination a circumstance which according to the celebrated Bernouli occasions a variation from the true time of above five and forty minutes  But whatever may have been the original of this whimsical custom the inhabitants of Basil are so strongly attached to it that as often as it has been proposed in the sovereign council to have their clocks properly regulated the motion has constantly been rejected  In reality the people would think their liberties invaded if their clocks were to go like the rest of the world's A few years ago it was secretly agreed upon by some of the leading men of the town to have the sundial turned half a minute a day until the shadow should imperceptibly point to the true hour This expedient was accordingly put in practice and the town clock had already lost near three quarters of an hour when an accident discovered the plot and the magistrates were compelled to place the sundial in the same position it stood before and to have the town clock regulated by it as usual Indeed longestablished customs however indifferent or ridiculous are apt to lay so strong a hold upon vulgar minds as to become sometimes dangerous and always difficult to be altered especially among a people like those of this country who are averse to any change even in the minutest articles I need not remind you how long it was before we could be persuaded in England to reckon our years according to the general mode of computation received by the rest of Europe  Basil is beautifully situated upon the banks of the Rhine near the point where that river which here becomes very broad deep and rapid after flowing for some way from east to west turns suddenly to the north It consists of two towns joined together by an handsome bridge the largest of which towns lies on the side of Swisserland and the smallest on the German side of the river It stands very advantageously for commerce and it is an advantage which the inhabitants have by no means neglected for they have established a great variety of manufactures of all sorts and a very extensive and lucrative trade is carried on by the principal merchants of the place  The cathedral is an elegant gothic building but strangely disfigured by a daubing of rosecoloured paint spread over the whole edifice In this cathedral are deposited under a marble tomb the venerable remains of the great Erasmus That distinguished writer joined to superior learning and a peculiar elegance of style the keenest wit which he pointed not only against the vices and ignorance of  the monks but the general corruptions and disorders of the church of Rome He was indeed the forerunner of Luther in his first attacks upon the catholics respecting the sale of indulgences but afterwards when the controversy appeared to be taking a more serious turn and an open breach with the church of Rome seemed inevitable he condemned the proceedings of that bold reformer He considered them indeed as altogether unwarrantable and although he had himself censured and exposed the corruptions that infected the catholic religion yet he zealously inculcated submissive obedience to the decrees of what he called the  "universal church"  Agreeably to these sentiments he advised the protestants to endeavour at obtaining by mild and patient measures what they might indiscreetly lose by a warmer and more violent opposition  Such temperate counsels were ill suited to the daring and impetuous spirit of Luther Accordingly while Erasmus was acting the part of a mediator and endeavouring to moderate and allay the flame on each side he drew upon himself the displeasure of both  parties by the one he was reproached for having gone too far and by the other for not having gone much farther In allusion to this trimming conduct one of his adversaries not unaptly applied to him that line in Virgil  " Terras inter caelumque volabat"  The impartial truth seems to be that he was by no means disposed to become a martyr in the cause and the natural timidity of his temper together with a too great deference to persons of superior rank and power and perhaps also the fear of losing his pensions probably entered into the prevailing motives that induced him to take a decided part against the reformers and condemn their separation from the church of Rome as an apostacy  But it would be uncandid to impute his conduct wholly to selfish considerations something may fairly be ascribed to the powerful impressions of early prejudices and something to that rooted love of peace and studious tranquillity which seems to have been the governing principle of most of his actions But whatever imperfections may be discovered in some particular parts of his character his memory  must ever be revered by every friend of genius learning and moderation Liveliness of imagination depth and variety of erudition together with great sagacity of judgment were in him eminently united He infused a spirit of elegance even into theological controversies and contributed to disencumber literature of that scholastic jargon with which it was disgraced in a word he wanted nothing but a little more courage to have been confessedly one of the first characters of the age in which he flourished Erasmus reflected much honour upon this town by choosing it as the favourite place of his residence and publishing from hence the greatest part of his valuable works In the public library are preserved with great veneration several of his letters and his last testament written with his own hand as also his hanger and his seal  The library contains some very valuable manuscripts the most curious of which are those relating to the council of Basil together with several volumes of letters written to and from the first reformers and from several men of letters of the fifteenth sixteenth and seventeenth  centuries The collection of books though not very considerable is chiefly remarkable for many rare and valuable editions particularly of those which were printed in the fifteenth century  In a suite of rooms belonging to this library is a cabinet of natural curiosities some antient medals and gems a few antiquities found at Augst a large collection of prints and some fine drawings and paintings consisting chiefly of originals by Holbein who was a native of this town These pictures are most of them in the highest preservation and what renders them the more valuable is that the connoisseur can here trace all the different manners of Holbein and compare the productions of his youth with those of his more mature age The most valuable of these pieces is the passion of our Saviour in eight compartments a performance in which this admirable artist has carried to the highest perfection that singular brilliancy of colouring so peculiar to all his compositions I was much struck with a profile of his friend and patron Erasmus writing  his commentary upon St Matthew there is a spirit and animation in the countenance wonderfully expressive of the great author's sagacious and penetrating talents  The dance of death in the churchyard of the predicants of the suburbs of St John is always shewn to strangers as being of Holbein's pencil It is painted in oilcolours upon a wall and guarded by an iron railing but as it has several times been retouched no traces are discoverable of that great master's hand In fact Mr Horace Walpole and other unquestionable judges have shewn beyond a doubt that it was painted not only before Holbein was born and as a memorial of the plague which raged at Basil during the sitting of the celebrated council appointed by Pope Eugenius IV in but that he was not even employed in retouching it It is probable however that from this antient performance he took the first hint towards composing his famous drawings of the dance of death In treating this subject he has discovered such wonderful richness of imagination and shewn  so much judgment in the disposition of the figures and so much spirit in the execution of them that Rubens studied them with particular attention and took drawings from them himself  The originals were purchased by Mr Fleichman of Strasbourg at the sale of the famous collection of Crozat at Paris of which Mariette has given a catalogue They are now in the possession of prince Gallicin ambassador from the empress of Russia to the court of Vienna They consist of fortyfour small drawings the outlines are sketched with a pen and they are slightly shaded with Indian ink I had frequent opportunities of seeing them during my continuance at Vienna and particularly admired the amazing variety of attitudes and characters in which death is represented    There are prints taken of some of these drawings by Hollar which are very scarce Mr de Mechel a celebrated artist of this place is now employed in engraving them after the original designs  They have been published since this letter was written Mr de Mechel has added four which are not in the prince's collection and which that artist has taken from the engravings of Hollar But he has omitted several delightful groupes of bacchanalian children as having no connection with the subject which are equal in nature and in beauty to any thing I ever saw of Rubens Mr de Mechel ingeniously conjectures from the dresses and characters of several of the figures in the dance of death that the author sketched them while he was in England They were probably in the Arundelian collection when Hollar copied them  a work  which cannot fail of being highly acceptable to the admirers of the fine arts He has nearly finished also a set of prints from the fine paintings of the Dusseldorf gallery and likewise the engravings of the famous Hedlinger's medals This able engraver has himself a small but wellchosen collection of paintings and his magazine of prints in which article he carries on a very considerable trade is perhaps the largest and most complete in Europe I am acquainted with no person to whom the curious traveller can address himself with greater advantage than to Mr de Mechel nor from whom he can receive more useful information To a particular knowledge of the physical beauties of Swisserland he joins a thorough acquaintance with the different governments customs and manners of the several cantons As he is intimately connected with the principal men of learning in this country his letters of recommendation are the most desirable and the  most beneficial that can be procured and he has as much satisfaction in conferring as can be received by accepting his good offices He is indeed possessed of a great fund of goodhumour an amiable frankness of disposition and a certain originality of manner which together with his other valuable qualities recommend him as a no less pleasing than useful acquaintance  I am c  LETTER XLI  THE town of Basil was formerly under the dominion of its bishops but their power was gradually diminished till at length and even before the reformation it was almost reduced to nothing In the canton joined the Helvetic confederacy and had the ninth rank assigned to it From that period the bishops quitted the town established their residence at Porentru and soon intirely lost what little authority and inconsiderable prerogatives remained to them Upon the introduction of the reformation  the constitution was in some measure changed the power of the aristocracy was much limited and the government took a more republican form than before  It would seem in theory scarce possible to divide the aristocratical and democratical commonwealths into so many different species as are to be found in Swisserland for in this country every republic has its peculiar modification which distinguishes it from all others of the same kind and there is none more singular than that of Basil To view the general outlines only of the constitution it has the appearance of being an absolute aristocracy  An aristocracy strictly speaking means that form of government which places the supreme power in the nobles exclusively of the people but here I mean by it the confining of the sovereign authority to a certain limited number of persons without considering whether they are patricians or plebeians nobles or commons for at Basil every citizen who is noble and who chuses to retain his title of nobility is excluded from all possibility of being elected a member of the sovereign council  but upon considering it in detail it will be found to incline towards a democracy The supreme legislative  power resides in the great and little councils consisting of about three hundred members and the authority of these two councils combined is without controul They enact laws make war and peace contract alliances and impose taxes they elect the several magistrates appoint their own members nominate to all employments and confer the right of burghership The general administration of government is committed by the sovereign council to the senate or little council that is to a part of its own body This senate is composed of sixty members together with the four chiefs of the republic two burgomasters and two tribunes these are divided into two bodies which act by rotation The acting division continues in office one year they decide finally in all criminal causes superintend the police and exercise several other powers subordinate to the sovereign council The collective body of citizens assembles only once a year when the magistrates publicly take an oath to maintain the laws and preserve the liberties and immunities of the people inviolate The  reciprocal oath of allegiance to the magistrates is administred to the citizens in their respective tribes  But notwithstanding the great and boundless prerogatives of the sovereign council yet the meanest citizen is legally capable of being admitted a member and by the singular method of election may possibly be chosen For the members of the two councils are drawn from all the several ranks of citizens one class only excepted  viz  the members of the university These citizens are divided into eighteen tribes fifteen of which belong to the larger town and three to the smaller each of the firstmentioned fifteen tribes returns four members to the senate and each of the whole eighteen sends twelve to the great council Formerly these elections were determined by a plurality of voices but as by this means the richest candidate was always certain of being chosen a  ternaire  as it is called was established that is three candidates were put in nomination and it was decided by lot which of the three should succeed to the vacant post  Although this mode of election put a  stop in some measure to corruption yet it was not sufficient to counteract entirely the influence of the wealthy and as the tradesmen of whom the greatest part of the sovereign council is composed could seldom or never succeed to the most honourable or lucrative employments they procured an act to be passed by which the  ternaire  was changed into a  senaire  that is to say six candidates instead of three were put in nomination and drew lots for the charge The names of these six are put into one bag and six tickets upon one of which the employment in question is written are put into another Two persons are appointed one to each bag to be the drawers of this  official  lottery and the candidate against whose name the ticket marked with the employment is drawn obtains the post  It would be too tedious and indeed too uninteresting a detail to enter into a minute account of the forms and circumstances requisite to be observed in selecting the several candidates to be put in nomination To give you however some general idea of this matterUpon a vacancy  in the great council for instance the six persons who are named for candidates must be taken from the citizens of that tribe to which the person who occasioned the vacancy belonged and must be nominated by such of the members of the sovereign council who are of the same tribe The candidates for the senate are in some instances nominated by the sovereign council at large and in others by those members only of the sovereign council who belong to the tribe in which the vacancy happens but in both instances the candidates put in nomination must be members of the great council There is but one case in which the  senaire  is not practised for upon the death of a burgomaster one of the tribunes succeeds of course to his office  It should seem that a variety of evils must necessarily flow from this absurd method of filling up vacant posts in the government as they are left intirely to the capricious disposal of fortune In fact it has not unfrequently happened that a candidate whose knowledge and abilities rendered him capable of being serviceable  to the state has never had the good luck to obtain the successful ticket while fortune has bestowed it upon another by no means qualified to fulfil the duties of the employment However notwithstanding the ill effects that occasionally must result from this casual method of election the management of public affairs is in general tolerably well conducted and there are few if any instances of civil justice being unwisely administred or of innocence being sacrificed to superior wealth or power  But it is not the counsellors of state and the several magistrates that are alone chosen by lot even the professors in the university are elected in the same manner The three candidates however for in this instance the  ternaire  is still in use must be nominated from among those who have taken their doctor's degrees Hence nothing is more common than to solicit the being chosen one of the candidates for the professorship of a science which the party has never made the peculiar object of his studies if the chair of that particular branch of literature in  which he excels is already occupied for under these circumstances the respective unqualified professors change places with each other Thus to mention an instance from a family well known to all who are conversant in mathematical learning John Bernouli the famous mathematical professor in this university who died in left two sons James and John still living who are justly celebrated for their skill in that science in which both their father and grandfather so eminently excelled John after having been several times an unsuccessful candidate for different professorships was at length chosen by lot professor of  rhetoric  but upon his father's death he changed with Mr Rumspeck to whom fortune with her usual judgment had thought proper to assign the chair of mathematics A similar circumstance happened to his brother Daniel chance conferred upon him the professorship of  botany  and  anatomy  which he some years afterwards had an opportunity of happily exchanging for that of natural philosophy  The sumptuary laws are very strict at Basil besides those which are common  to some other of the Swiss republics the jealousy of the democratical party has procured additional ones The use of coaches in the town is not prohibited here as at Zuric but what is more singular no citizen or inhabitant who keeps his carriage is allowed to have a servant behind it Their laws of this kind may perhaps be carried in some instances to a scrupulous and even ridiculous minuteness upon the whole however they are excellent regulations and not only useful but necessary in a small republic They have certainly operated with great advantage in this town for although it contains several families who are considerably rich yet a happy simplicity of manners is still so predominant that you would smile if I were to particularise those articles which pass here under the opprobrious denomination of  luxury  And notwithstanding the neighbourhood of France the French modes and fashions which are so universally spread among the principal inhabitants of Fribourg and Soleure are totally unknown at Basil  The lower rank of citizens are in general  so strongly prejudiced in favour of their own country that they seem to be well convinced true felicity is only to be found at Basil and indeed that class of people are in no part of the world more happy Every person boasts that he is free and in reality is so and as the citizens not only possess very considerable privileges and immunities but each individual may also indulge the hope of being one day chosen into the sovereign council he enjoys a certain degree of respect and consideration extremely  flattering  to his selfimportance In fact there are several among the magistrates who exercise the meaner trades one of the present members of the little council is a baker He is indeed a man of distinguished knowledge and merit and has had a chance even of being chief of the republic for he has been twice nominated one of the six candidates for the tribuneship of the people  The conduct of magistrates is no where more freely nor more severely criticised than at Basil The people may sometimes no doubt extend this privilege beyond its proper limits but they can never be totally restrained from exercising  it without striking at the vitals of their liberty it is essential to its existence and no free government can long survive its extinction  Basil is by far the largest and seems formerly to have been one of the most populous towns of Swisserland its extent is capable of containing with ease above an hundred thousand inhabitants whereas it can scarcely number eleven thousand Many particular causes may have concurred to occasion this remarkable decrease of people but I will mention only one or two of the general reasons to which it may be assigned  It is proved from undoubted calculations that in all great cities the number of burials exceeds that of births consequently unless this unequal proportion of the latter to the former be compensated by a constant accession of new inhabitants every great town in process of time must necessarily become depopulated Now the citizens of Basil are so jealous of the right of burghership and pride themselves so much upon the privileges which accompany it that they seldom deign to confer it upon foreigners a  supply therefore to ballance that gradual waste of people I have mentioned can never be had by an influx of strangers where they are not permitted to carry on any commerce or to follow any trade A few years ago indeed some of the magistrates sensible of the impolicy of this unlimited prohibition procured a law by which the freedom of the town and the right of burghership was allowed to be conferred upon strangers but it was clogged at the same time with so many restrictions as by no means to answer the purpose for which it was intended Every principle indeed of private interest and ambition concurred to prevent its efficacy and no wonder for bodies of men are seldom actuated by so generous a spirit as to sacrifice their personal and immediate advantages to the future welfare and prosperity of their country  I am c  LETTER XLII  CURIOSITY led me during my continuance at Basil to visit the hospital and buryingground of St James not  far from the town and near the small river Birsch celebrated for a most remarkable and desperate combat which was fought in between the Swiss and the dauphin of France afterwards Louis XI and never was Swiss valour and intrepidity so signally displayed as by a few battalions of their troops on that memorable day  This famous battle was in consequence of some disputes which arose between the canton of Zuric and those of Schweitz and Glaris The former refusing to abide by the mediation of the five neutral cantons who had decided in favour of the two latter a civil war ensued upon which occasion Zuric entered into an alliance with the emperor Frederic III The seven lastmentioned cantons in order to force the canton of Zuric to renounce this alliance with the house of Austria which they justly considered as an infringement of their league laid siege to that town Frederic unable to send a sufficient body of troops to its relief applied for additional succours to Charles VII king of France who as well with a view of dissolving the council of Basil as for the particular purpose  required ordered a considerable army of mercenary troops to march under the command of his son Louis Accordingly the dauphin entered with his forces into Alsace and after laying waste and harrassing the adjacent provinces appeared before Basil Upon this occasion a detachment of fifteen hundred Swiss from the army of the confederates at that time employed in besieging Farnsberg were ordered to throw themselves into the town of Basil which was but thinly garrisoned  This handful of men advanced without interruption to the plain of Brattelen where they charged with such determined and wellconducted valour eight thousand of the enemy's cavalry that the latter were driven back as far as Mutleez at which place the repulsed were joined by another corps but notwithstanding this reinforcement the Swiss attacking them again with the same intrepidity as before forced them to repass the river Birsch where the main body of the army was chiefly drawn up Such was the firmness and solidity of the Swiss in these several rencounters that to use  the expression of an old French chronicle when the cavalry charged  "they could make no more impression than if they had attacked a rock or an impenetrable wall"  The Swiss encouraged by this wonderful success and exasperated with the most spirited indignation against the invaders of their country disregarding the remonstrances of their officers rashly attempted to force their passage over a bridge which was guarded by a large body of the enemy but this effort of inconsiderate valour proving ineffectual every man of these gallant soldiers throwing himself into the river where it was fordable gained the opposite shore in the face of a battery of cannon that was playing against them  But what could the desperate courage of so small a number of troops avail against an army of men advantageously posted in an open plain They had no alternative but either to throw down their arms or gloriously expire with them in their hands They bravely chose the latter accordingly five hundred of them took possession of a small island near the bridge where after resolutely defending  themselves to the last extremity they were all of them cut to pieces A like number forced their way through the ranks of the enemy and were making towards Basil when they were opposed by a large body of horse who were posted there to prevent the inhabitants of the town from sallying out and coming to the relief of their countrymen Being now surrounded on all sides they threw themselves into the hospital of St James and lining the walls of the buryingground resisted for some time the united assaults of the whole French army At length the hospital being set on fire and the cannon having battered down the walls of the buryingground they fought no longer in hopes of victory but still resolving that it should cost their enemies as dear as possible they continued to defend their lives to the last gasp  Aeneas Sylvius afterwards pope Pius II relates among other actions of singular valour exerted by this heroic troop a particular instance which I cannot forbear mentioning Four of the French attacked a single Swiss and having killed and stripped him proceeded to insult the  dead body being observed by a companion of the slain he seized a battleax rushed upon the four killed two of them and put the others to flight then flinging the dead body of his friend upon his shoulders carried it to a place of security and returning to the attack was killed  Of the whole number but sixteen escaped from the field of battle and these agreeably to the old Spartan discipline were branded with infamy for not having sacrificed their lives in defence of their country Among those who were desperately wounded and left upon the field of action thirtytwo only were found still alive The names of many of these glorious combatants were carefully registered and still remain upon record  It is not easy to ascertain the number of forces on both sides in this ever memorable engagement As far as one can judge by comparing the several relations of the French and German historians the army of the dauphin amounted at least to Charles VII and his son Louis in their letters to the German princes on this occasion represent  the total loss of the Swiss to have been about and perhaps that account is not much exaggerated With respect to the slain on the side of the dauphin the amount is still more uncertain his loss however must have been very considerable for he remained three days upon the field of battle and the better to conceal the number of the killed he ordered the dead bodies to be secretly buried in different parts of the neighbourhood Add to this that he was effectually prevented from prosecuting his designs upon Swisserland and compelled to retire with his shattered army into Alsace That prince himself indeed declared that such another victory would ruin his army and generously confessed that he derived no other advantage from it than to know and esteem the valour of the Swiss Accordingly this combat may be considered as forming a remarkable aera in the history of the Swiss for it gave rise to their treaty with Charles VII and was the first alliance they ever entered into with France  The war however between the house of Austria and Zuric on one side and  the seven cantons on the other continued until the year when a peace was concluded by the mediation and decision of the arbiters chosen for that purpose Zuric renounced its alliance with the house of Austria and the Helvetic confederacy was again solemnly renewed and confirmed between the eight cantons Upon this occasion two very important articles of the public law of Swisserland were finally settled First that all disputes between any of the particular cantons shall be decided by the mediation of the neutral ones and in case either of the two contending parties refuse to acquiesce under their judgment the neutral cantons are empowered to have recourse to arms in order to compel the republic in question to abide by their determination Secondly notwithstanding the right which either of the cantons might have reserved to itself of contracting alliances with foreign powers yet the other confederates are to judge whether such alliance is contradictory to or incompatible with the articles of the general union and if it should appear to be so it is declared utterly null and void  I cannot close this letter without adding that the Swiss still talk of this famous action with the warmest enthusiasm Accordingly the inhabitants of Basil form parties every year to an inn situated near the hospital and buryingground abovementioned in order to commemorate in a red wine produced from some vineyards planted on the field of battle the heroic deeds of their brave countrymen who so gloriously sacrificed their lives upon the occasion This wine which they call  "the blood of the Swiss"  is highly prized by the Basilians though it has little to recommend it in point of flavour nevertheless I am much mistaken if that famous line of Horace  Non missura cutem nisi  plena cruoris    was more applicable to the teazing poet he mentions than it is to those jovial patriotic parties at their anniversary potations of the  "  Sang des Suisses  "  I am c  LETTER XLIII  HAVING in the course of my former letters communicated to you such observations as I was able to make during my tour through Swisserland concerning the laws government state of literature c of each canton in particular I will now request from you the same candid indulgence I have so repeatedly experienced whilst I lay before you a few concluding remarks in relation to the state of Swisserland in general  There is no part of Europe which contains within the same extent of region so many independent commonwealths and such a variety of different governments as are collected together in this remarkable and delightful country and yet with such wisdom was the Helvetic union composed and so little have the Swiss of late years been actuated with the spirit of conquest that since the firm and complete establishment of their general confederacy they have scarcely ever had occasion to employ their arms against a foreign enemy and  have had no hostile commotions among themselves that were not soon happily terminated Perhaps there is not a similar instance in antient or modern history of a warlike people divided into little independent republics closely bordering upon each other and of course having occasionally interfering interests having continued during so long a period in an almost uninterrupted state of tranquillity And thus while the several neighbouring kingdoms have suffered by turns all the horrors of internal war this favoured nation hath enjoyed the felicity described by Lucretius and looked down with security upon the various tempests that have shaken the world around them  But the happiness of a long peace has neither broken the spirit nor enervated the arm of this people The youth are diligently trained to all the martial exercises such as running wrestling and shooting both with the crossbow and the musket a considerable number of welldisciplined Swiss troops are always employed in foreign services and the whole people are enrolled and regularly  exercised in their respective militia By these means they are capable in case it should be necessary of collecting a very respectable body of forces which could not fail of proving formidable to any enemy who should invade their country or attack their liberties Thus while most of the other states upon the continent are tending more and more towards a military government Swisserland alone has no standing armies and yet from the nature of its situation from its particular alliances and from the policy of its internal government is more secure from invasion than any other European power and full as able to withstand the greatest force that can be brought against it  But the felicity of Swisserland does not consist merely in being peculiarly exempted from the burdens and miseries of war there is no country in which happiness and content more universally prevail among the people For whether the government be aristocratical democratical or mixed absolute or limited a general spirit of liberty pervades and actuates the several constitutions so that even the oligarchical states which of all  others are usually the most tyrannical are here peculiarly mild and the property of the subject is securely guarded against every kind of violation  But there is one general defect in their criminal jurisprudence which prevails throughout this country For although the Caroline code as it is styled or the code of the Emperor Charles the Vth forms in each of the republics the principal basis of their penal laws with particular modifications and additions in different districts yet much too great a latitude is allowed to the respective judges who are less governed in their determinations by this code or any other written law than by the common principles of justice How far long experience may have justified the prudence of trusting them with this extraordinary privilege I cannot say but discretionary powers of this kind are undoubtedly liable to the most alarming abuse and can never without the greatest hazard be committed to the hands of the magistrate  I cannot forbear reflecting upon this occasion on the superior wisdom in the present instance as well as in many others  of our own most invaluable constitution and indeed it is impossible for an Englishman to observe in his travels the governments of other countries without becoming a warmer and more affectionate admirer of his own In England the life and liberty of the subject does not depend upon the arbitrary decision of his judge but is secured by express laws from which no magistrate can depart with impunity This guarded precision it is true may occasionally perhaps be attended with some inconveniences but they are overbalanced by advantages of so much greater weight as to be scarcely perceptible in the scales of justice I do not mean however to throw any imputation upon the officers of criminal jurisdiction in Swisserland as far as I could observe they administer distributive justice with an impartial and equitable hand  I remarked with peculiar satisfaction the excellent state of the prisons throughout this country and the humane precautions which the several legislatures have taken with respect to felons a circumstance which could not fail of  striking me the more forcibly as the contrary is but too visible in England In Swisserland the criminals are confined in wholesome and separate wards and instead of languishing long in prison to the great injury of their health or total waste of their little remnant of money they are almost immediately brought to trial In England a criminal or one suspected to be such may be confined six months before his fate shall be determined and if he happen to be proved innocent and should be in low circumstances the loss of his time together with the expences of the gaolfees may probably occasion his utter ruin while his morals are in no less danger by being compelled to associate with a set of abandoned wretches lost to all sense of shame and encouraging each other in their common profligacy How much is it to be lamented that while our code of criminal jurisprudence is in general formed upon principles which distinguish us with honour among the nations of Europe that our courts of justice are thrown open to the view of all the world and that we enjoy the inestimable and almost peculiar privilege of being tried by  our equals how much I cannot forbear repeating is it to be lamented that the same equitable and humane spirit should be found wanting in so important an article of our penal laws  For a more particular account of the prisons in Swisserland the reader is referr'd to a treatise concerning  "  The state of the prisons in England and Wales and an account of some foreign prisons by John Howard  Esq  "  In this treatise which merits the attention of every friend to humanity the worthy author has produced many melancholy proofs of the sad state of the English prisons and how very inferior they are to those abroad in every circumstance relating to the health and good government of the unhappy persons confined in them And it cannot but afford him the most sensible satisfaction to find that his benevolent and persevering labours have already been productive of some very advantageous regulations particularly concerning the fees of prisoners who shall be acquitted and the prevention of the gaol distemper As Mr H still continues his laudable researches through all the most considerable prisons upon the continent and intends submitting the result of them to the consideration of Parliament it may justly be hoped that he will be rewarded with the happiness of having become the means of effectually fixing the attention of the British Senate upon an object so highly deserving the care of every wise and humane legislature    One cannot but be astonished as well as concerned to find that in a country  where the true principles of civil government are so well understood and so generally adopted as in Swisserland that the trial by torture is not yet abolished for in some particular cases the suspected criminal is still put to the rack The inefficacy no less than the inhumanity of endeavouring to extort the truth by the several horrid instruments which too ingenious cruelty has devised for that purpose has been so often exposed by the ablest writers that it would be equally impertinent and superfluous to trouble you with any reflections of mine upon the subject and indeed the whole strength of the several arguments that have been urged upon this occasion is comprised in the very just and pointed observation of the admirable Bruyere that  la question est une invention merveilleuse toutàfait sûre pour perdre un innocent qui a la complexion foible sauver un coupable qui est né robuste  Caracteres Vol ii p  I cannot however but add in justice to the Swiss that zealous advocates have not been wanting among them for the total abolition of torture but arguments  of reason and sentiments of humanity have been found even in this civilised and enlightened country to avail little against inveterate custom and longconfirmed prejudices  Criminal justice is here as in the greatest part of Europe administred agreeably to the rules of the civil law According to the maxims of that code the criminal's confession is absolutely requisite in order to his suffering capital punishment and consequently all those nations who have not established a new code of criminal jurisprudence retain the use of torture  The present king of Prussia it is well known set the example in Germany of abolishing this inhuman practice but few perhaps are apprised that the first hint of this reformation was suggested to him by reading the History of England For one of the principal arguments in support of this method of extorting confession being that it affords the best means of discovering plots against government the sagacious monarch remarked that the British annals fully confuted the fallacy of that reasoning Few kingdoms he observed had abounded more in conspiracies and rebellions than England and yet that the leaders and abettors of them had been more successfully traced and discovered without the use of torture than in any country where it was practised "From thence" added this wise politician speaking upon the subject  "I saw the absurdity of torture and abolished it accordingly"  The above anecdote which I had from very respectable authority bears the most honourable testimony to the efficacy as well as the mildness of our penal laws and to the superior excellency of the process observed in our courts of criminal justice    Learning is less generally diffused among the catholic than the protestant states but in both a man of letters will find abundant opportunities of gratifying his researches and improving his knowledge To the natural philosopher Swisserland will afford an inexhaustible source of entertainment and information as well from the great variety of physical curiosities so plentifully spread over the country as from the considerable number of persons eminently skilled in that branch of science Indeed in every town and almost in every village the curious traveller will meet with collections worthy of his attention  If the reader should be desirous of particular information concerning the several lastmentioned articles he will find his curiosity gatified in the most satisfactory manner in Bernouli's  Letters sur different sujets  c which contain not only a very accurate description of all the various cabinets and collections of natural history to which I have alluded but also an account of the several men of letters who have distinguished themselves in Germany Swisserland and the south of France The ingenious author proposes favouring the world with two additional volumes upon the same subjects relating to Italy    With respect to agriculture there is perhaps no country in the world where the advantageous effects of unwearied and persevering industry are more remarkably conspicuous In travelling over the mountainous parts of Swisserland I was struck with admiration and astonishment to observe rocks that were formerly barren now planted with vines or abounding in rich pasture and to mark the traces of the plough along the sides of precipices so steep that it must be with great difficulty that a horse could even mount them In a word the inhabitants seem to have surmounted every obstruction which soil situation and climate had thrown in their way and to have spread fertility over various spots of the country which nature seemed to have consigned to everlasting barrenness In fine a general simplicity of manners an open and unaffected frankness together with an invincible spirit of freedom may justly be mentioned in the number of those  peculiar qualities which dignify the public character of this people and distinguish them with honour among the nations of Europe  I have now laid before you the principal observations which occurred to me in my journey through Swisserland happy if they may in any respect have contributed to your information or amusement They were originally intended merely as a private memorial of friendship but I have an additional satisfaction in the very unexpected opportunity they now afford me of more openly testifying the sincere esteem
