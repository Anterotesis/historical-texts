 THE TRIUMPH of ISIS A POEM OCCASIONED BY ISIS an ELEGY  Quid mihi nescio quam proprio cum Tybride Romani  Semper in ore geris referunt si vera Parentes  Hanc Urbem insano Nullus qui Marte petivit  Laetatus violâsse redît Nec numina sedem  Destituunt  CLAUDIAN  LONDON Printed for W OWEN at  Homer  's  Head  near  TempleBar  THE TRIUMPH OF ISIS  ON closing flow'rs when genial gales diffuse  The fragrant tribute of refreshing dews  When chaunts the milkmaid at her balmy pail  And weary reapers whistle o'er the vale  Charm'd by the murmurs of the quiv'ring shade  O'er ISIS' willowfringed banks I stray'd  And calmly musing thro' the twilight way  In pensive mood I fram'd the Doric lay  When lo from opening clouds a golden gleam  Pour'd sudden splendours o'er the shadowy stream  And from the wave arose its guardian queen  Known by her sweeping stole of glossy green  While in the coral crown that bound her brow  Was wove the Delphic laurel's verdant bough  As the smooth surface of the dimply flood  The silverslipper'd virgin lightly trod  From her loose hair the dropping dew she press'd  And thus mine ear in accents mild address'd  "No more my son the rural reed employ  Nor trill the trifling strain of empty joy  No more thy loveresounding sonnets suit  To notes of past'ral pipe or oaten flute  For hark▪ high thron'd on you majestic walls  To the dear Muse afflicted Freedom calls▪  When Freedom calls and OXFORD bids thee sing  Why stays thy hand to strike the sounding string  While thus in Freedom's and in Phoebus' spite  The venal sons of slavish CAM unite▪  To shake you tow'rs when malice rears her crest  Shall all my sons in silence idly rest  Still sing O CAM thy fav'rite Freedom's cause  Still boast of Freedomwhile you break its laws  To pow'r your songs of  gratulation  pay  To courts address soft flatt'ry's soothing lay  What tho' your gentle MN's plaintive verse  Has hung with sweetest wreaths MUSAEUS' herse  What tho' your vaunted bard's ingenuous woe  Soft as my stream in tuneful numbers flow  Yet strove his Muse by fame or envy led  To tear the laurels from a Sister's head  Misguided youth with rude unclassic rage  To blast the beauties of thy whiter page  A rage that sullies ev'n thy guiltless lays  And blasts the vernal bloom of half thy Bays  Let GRboast the patrons of her name  Each pompous fool of fortune and of fame  Still of preferment let her shine the queen  Prolific parent of each bowing Dean  Be her's each Prte of the pamper'd cheek  Each courtly Chaplain sanctify'd and sleek  Still let the Drones of her exhaustless hive  On fat pluralities supinely thrive  Still let her senates titled slaves revere  Nor dare to know the patriot from the peer  For tinsel'd courts their laurel'd mount despise  In stars and strings superlatively wise  No longer charm'd by virtue's golden lyre  Who sung of old amid th' Aonian choir  Where CAM slowwinding thro' the breezy reeds  With kindly wave his groves of laurel feeds  'Tis ours my son to deal the sacred bay  Where honour calls and justice points the way  To wear the wellearn'd wreath which merit brings▪  And snatch a gift beyond the reach of kings  Scorning and scorn'd by courts yon Muses bow'r  Still nor enjoys nor asks the smile of pow'r  Tho' wakeful vengeance watch my chrystal spring  Tho' persecution wave her iron wing  And o'er yon spiry temples as she flies  "These destin'd feats be mine" exulting cries  On ISIS▪ still each gift of fortune waits  Still peace and plenty crown my beauteous gates  See Science walks with freshest chaplets crown'd  With songs of joy my festal groves resound  My Muse divine still keeps her wonted state  The front erect and high majestic gait  Green as of old each oliv'd portal smiles  And still the Graces build my Parian piles  My Gothic spires in ancient grandeur rise  And dare with wonted pride to rush into the ski  Ah should'st thou fall forbid it heav'nly pow'  Dash'd into dust with all thy hundred tow'rs  Who but would mourn to British virtue dear  What patriot could refuse the manly tear  What British  Vid Vell Paterc Lib  ii  Plutarch in Vit Marii  MARIUS would refuse to weep  O'er mighty CARTHAGE fall'n a prostrate heap  E'en late when RADCLIFFE'S delegated train  Auspicious shone in ISIS' happy plain  When you proud ‖  ‡ The Radcliffe Library  dome fair Learning's amplest shrine  Beneath its Attick roofs receiv'd the Nine  Mute was the voice of joy and loud applause  To RADCLIFFE due and ISIS' honour'd cause  What freeborn crouds adorn'd the festive day  Nor blush'd to wear my tributary bay  How each brave breast with honest ardours heav'd  When SHELDON'S fane the patriot band receiv'd  While as we loudly hail'd the chosen few  Rome's awful senate rush'd upon our view  O may the day in latest annals shine  That made a BEAUFORT and an HARLEY mine  That bade them leave the loftier scene awhile  The pomp of guiltless state the patriot toil  For bleeding Albion's aid the sage design  To hold short dalliance with the tuneful Nine  While music left her golden sphere on high  And bore each strain of triumph from the sky  Swell'd the loud song and to my chiefs around  Pour'd the full Paeans of mellifluous sound  My Naiads blythe the floating accents caught  And list'ning danc'd beneath their pearly grot  In gentle eddies play'd my wanton wave  And all my reeds their softest whispers gave  Each lay with brighter green adorn'd my bow'rs  And breath'd a fresher fragrance on my flow'rs  But lo at once the swelling concerts cease  And crouded theatres are hush'd in peace  See on yon sage how all attentive stand  To catch his darting eye and waving hand  Hark he begins with all a TULLY's art  To pour the dictates of a CATO's heart  Skill'd to pronounce what noblest thoughts inspire  He blends the Speaker's with the Patriot's fire  Bold to conceive nor timorous to conceal  What Britons dare to think he dares to tell  'Tis his alike the ear and eye to charm  To win with action and with sense to warm  Untaught in flow'ry diction to dispense  The lulling sounds of sweet impertinence  In frowns or smiles he gains an equal prize  Nor meanly fears to fall nor creeps to rise  Bids happier days to ALBION be restor'd  Bids ancient justice rear her radiant sword  From me as from my country wins applause  And makes an OXFORD's a BRITANNIA's cause  While arms like these my stedfast sages wield  While mine is Truth's impenetrable shield  Say shall the PUNY CHAMPION fondly dare  To wage with force like this  scholastic  war  Still vainly scribble on with pert pretence  With all the rage of pedant impotence  Say shall I foster this domestic pest  This parricide that wounds a mother's breast  Thus in some stately ship that long has bore  Britain's victorious cross from shore to shore  By chance beneath her close sequester'd cells▪  Some lowborn worm a lurking mischief dwells  Eats his blind way and saps with secret toil  The deep foundation of the watry pile  In vain the forrest lent its stateliest pride  Rear'd her tall mast and fram'd her knotty side  In vain the thunder's martial rage she stood  With each fierce conflict of the stormy flood  More sure the reptile's little arts devour  Than waves or wars or Eurus' wintry pow'r  Ye venerable bow'rs ye seats sublime  Clad in the mossy vest of fleeting time  Ye stately Piles of old munificence  At once the pride of Learning and defence  Where ancient Piety a matron hoar  Still seems to keep the hospitable door  Ye cloisters pale that lengthening to the sight  Still step by step to musings mild invite  Ye high arch'd walls where oft the bard has caught  The glowing sentiment the lofty thought  Ye temples dim where pious duty pays  Her holy hymns of everechoing praise  Lo your lov'd ISIS from the bord'ring vale  With all a mother's fondness bids you hail  Hail OXFORD hail of all that's good and great  Of all that's fair the guardian and the seat  Nurse of each brave pursuit each generous aim  By truth exalted to the throne of fame  Like Greece in science and in liberty  As Athens learn'd as Lacedaemon free  Ev'n now confest to my adoring eyes  In awful ranks thy sacred sons arise  With ev'ry various flow'r thy temples wreath'd  That in thy gardens green its fragrance breath'd  Tuning to knightly tale his British reeds  Thy crowding Bards immortal CHAUCER leads  His hoary head o'erlooks the gazing choir  And beams on all around caelestial fire  With graceful step see ADDISON advance  The sweetest child of Attic elegance  To all but his belov'd embrace deny'd  See LOCKE leads Reason his majestic bride  See sacred HAMMOND as he treads the field  With goldlike arm uprears his heav'nly shield  All who beneath the shades of gentle peace  Best plan'd the labours of domestic ease  Who taught with truth or with persuasion mov'd  Who sooth'd with Numbers or with sense improv'd  Who told the pow'rs of reason or refin'd  All all that strengthen'd or adorn'd the mind  Each priest of health who mix'd the balmy bowl  To rear frail man and stay the fleeting soul  All crowd around and echoing to the sky  Hail OXFORD hail with filial transport cry  And see yon solemn band with virtuous aim  'Twas theirs in thought the glorious deed to frame  With pious plans each musing feature glows  And wellweigh'd counsels mark their meaning brows  "  Vid the ELEGY Pag  Lo these the leaders of thy patriot line"  HAMDEN and HOOKER HYDE and SIDNEY shine  These from thy source the fires of Freedom caught  How well thy sons by their example taught  While in each breast th' hereditary flame  Still blazes unextinguish'd and the same  Nor all the toils of thoughtful peace engage  'Tis thine to form the hero as the sage  I see the sablesuited prince advance  With lillies crown'd the spoils of bleeding France  EDWARDthe Muses in yon hallow'd shade  Bound on his tender thigh the martial blade  Bade him the steel for British freedom draw  And OXFORD taught the deeds that CRESSY saw  And see great father of the laureat band  The  Alfred Regis Romani V Virg Aen    BRITISH KING before me seems to stand  He by my plentycrowned scenes beguil'd  And genial influence of my seasons mild  Hither of yore forlorn forgotten maid  The Muse in prattling infancy convey'd  From Gothic rage the helpless virgin bore  And fix'd her cradle on my friendly shore  Soon grew the maid beneath his fost'ring hand  Soon pour'd her blessings o'er th' enlighten'd land  Tho' rude the dome and humble the retreat  Where first his pious care ordain'd her seat  Lo now on high she dwells in Attic bow'rs  And proudly lifts to heav'n her hundred tow'rs  He first fair Learning's and Britannia's cause  Adorn'd with manners and advanc'd with laws  He bade relent the Briton's savage heart  And form'd his soul to social scenes of art  Wisest and best of Kingswith ravish'd gaze  Elate the long procession he surveys  Joyful he smiles to find that not in vain  He plan'd the rudiments of Learning's reign  Himself he marks in each ingenuous breast  With all the founder in the race exprest  With rapture views fair Freedom still survive  In yon bright domes illfated fugitive  Such scene as when the
