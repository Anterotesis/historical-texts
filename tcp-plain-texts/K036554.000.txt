 THE Countess of Salisbury  A TRAGEDY  As it is performed at the THEATRE ROYAL IN THE HAYMARKET  BY HALL HARTSON ESQR  LONDON Sold by W GRIFFIN in CatharineStreet  Pr  d  TO ELIZABETH COUNTESS OF MOIRA  MADAM  THE attention you have vouchsafed to the Countess of Salisbury and the Author ever since they have had the honour of being known to your Ladyship persuades me that you will take pleasure in hearing it has been favourably received on the English Theatre Stript now of all stage decoration and the assistance which it has hitherto received from the most animated performance it is to undergo a stricter scrutiny that of the closet a scrutiny for which it is indeed but little provided I know your Ladyship will make a tender allowance for want of experience in the Author and such errors as are incident to human inperfection but this is an indulgence which I doubt the critic will not so readily shew him But however he may censure I must ever think myself happy in having already acquired your Ladyship's good opinions I am also flattered as often as I think of the near resemblance my Heroine has of your Ladyship Had I been earlier honoured with your Ladyship's acquaintance I think I could have much enlarged the  character And yet there are many virtues many delicacies which it would have been impossible for me to have preserved in the picture of which those only can be truly sensible who have the happiness of being acquainted with the Original  Please Madam to accept the following attempt as an offering of my gratitude for many favours an imperfect indeed but honest proof of the esteem which is due from  MADAM  Your LADYSHIP's Most respectful Most obliged Humble Servant H HARTSON  ADVERTISEMENT  THE COUNTESS OF SALISBURY made her appearance about two years ago in Ireland where she was received with very singular marks of favour the Author there had many friends and with all the partiality they might be supposed to have for him those friends did not hesitate to declare that the excellent performance of Mrs Dancer and Mr Barry contributed largely to the success of the Piece written in his early youth without having much knowledge of the stage or dramatic performances the Author is sensible what his Tragedy must be notwithstanding the smiles with which it has been indulged England agreeable to the character of good nature and generosity which it has established through all the world has kindly followed the example of its sister nation and received with an indulgence the attempt of a young Writer who is indeed ambitious of pleasing but dare not aspire to excellence He attributes in great measure his good fortune now to what his friends attributed it before the animated performance of Mrs Dancer and Mr Barry it is theirs to endeavour to support a reputation already gained his to aim at improvement in order to acquire one  PROLOGUE SPOKEN BY Mr WESTON in the CHARACTER of a TEAGUE  MY jewels I'm come to spake in the behalf  Hoot Devil burn you all you makes me laugh  Upon my soul now I don't take it well in you  Arra be easy till I'm after telling you  Smit with the love of glory and of pelf  To night a bard from Dublin its ownself  Has brought a play here for your approbation  A very pretty thing by my salvation  If you'll trust Irish evidence I mean  I can't the story very well explain  But it's about a Countess and an Earl  The Countess is a mighty honest girl  But there's a villain with a damn'd cramp'd name  Makes such proposhals'tis a burning shame  Another tooa Knightbekeys as why  But hould you know you'll see it by and by  And then 'tis time enough to tell the plot  O but that's true I'd like to have forgot  The dresses'Pon my conscience in my days  I never saw their peer they're all a blaze  Then there's a child the sweetest little rogue  Only excuse a trifling spice of brogue  He'll make you cry your eyes out I'll be bound  'Tis Ireland is the true poetic ground  The MusesPhoebus heath'nish cant I loath  What's Mount Parnassus to the Hill of Howth  Or all the scenes each foolish poet paints  O bub bubboo give me the Isle of Saints  Turn up your noses cavil now and carp  Musha I'm sure our emblem is the harp  But stop the bell rings Fait they'll soon begin  'Tis time for me to be a going in  I take my lave thenbut dear craters mind  Pray to our Irish poetry be kind  'Tis a new manufacture in effect  And yours my sowls t' encourage and protect  No critic custom then exacted be  Pass it like Irish linen duty free  EPILOGUE Spoken by Mrs DANCER  THIS virgin author's such a blushing rogue  What no gay lively laughing epilogue  "Madam says he and look'd so wise in Greece"  Greece that's their cant "no jesting clos'd the piece  "Play epilogue and all were grave and solemn"  Then Sir the town were fools that did not mawl 'em  Nolet your heroine in this laughing age  Come thus as Bayes says souse upon the stage  Then with a jaunty air half smile half grin  Curtsey quite round the boxes and begin  A spark from court and no one to detect him  A pretty fellow too and yet reject him  Now Ladies let me die but it was silly  You'll not approve such horrid pruderywill ye  I shou'd have bless'd the occasion and receiv'd him  He shou'd have kneel'd and vow'd and Ibeliev'd him  Laugh'd danc'd and sported it till spouse came over  Then kiss'd my dearwhile Betty hid my lover  But here again our Poet checks my flight  "Nay Madam you mistake the matter quite  "My heroine liv'd in ancient honest times  "Cards were unknown and gallantries were crimes"  'Psha what if females then were seldom rovers  Husbandsaye there's the cause were warm as lovers  Their warlike days indeed were spent in killing  But then at nightno turtles were so billing  Welltho' he gives me no smart

Grey  I am even weary of the vain pursuit  GREY  It is in truth my lord an irksome labour  RAYMOND  But now I cast me at the fair one's feet  Pleaded my passion with whatever arts  Might best the gentle purpose aid but she  Instead of such return as I might hope  Repaid me with an eye of cold contempt  Of her late gallant lord she spoke his merits  In opposition hateful plac'd to mine  Urg'd then with recollection of her wrongs  Like the loud torrent with steep winter rains  O'ercharg'd in all the loose ungovern'd sway  Of wrath and indignation she assail'd me  GREY  And did my lord in

succour then  No generous hand to vindicate my wrongs  Oh Salisbury Salisbury why if yet thou liv'st  Fond hope he lives not else with speed of thought  Would he repair to his afflicted Ela  ELEANOR  Why dearest lady will you yield you up  A prey to purpos'd sorrow Time is fruitful  And the next hour perhaps may bring thee comfort  Lady SALISBURY  Day after day I have watch'd the joyless hours  Night after night when some fleet courier sent  Before perchance or letter fraught with sweet  Assurance of his safety might appear  Five tedious moons have pass'd since first were told  The dismal

Despair thus weigh thee down I yet have hope  Lady SALISBURY  Away with hope away No no full loud  As I remember and outrageous blew  The storm that even the solid fabric shook  Of yonder walls

plated armour wont  T' oppose my fond embraceSweet times farewel  These tender offices are now no more  Lord WILLIAM  Mother why do you speak so You make me sad  Lady SALISBURY  It is too soon my child for thee to know  What sadness is  Lord WILLIAM  Will not my father come home soon Eleanor told me he wou'd she wou'd not tell a lye  Lady SALISBURY  No love  Lord WILLIAM  Then he will come

passions turbulent  And rude a baleful crew unnumber'd as  The forest leaves that strew the earth in autumn  When happiness is round thee when thou art on  The lap of downy ease when thou art cherish'd  In the fair bosom of unruffl'd joy  Comes a fell hand dashes thee rudely down  And leaves thee to despair  ELEANOR  Cease  Cease lady to afflict thee Raymond may  I trust he will e'er long

kind  I dare not must not bear my lord  Lady SALISBURY  Must not  GREY  'Tis cruel toward the man who loves so fondly  Lady SALISBURY  Doth he assume the specious name of love  Love is a bright a generous quality  Heaven gave to noble minds pure and unmix'd  With every grosser stuff a goodly flower  Shoots up and blossoms in great souls alone  GREY  The mind th' exalted soul thou nam'st is his  Lives there a youth more gentle of condition  In fair accomplishments more grac'd admir'd  If beauty sway thy fond regards if wealth  I know not in fair England one with him  Can vie  Lady SALISBURY

weaponBe firm and prosper  Morton  receives a dagger and goes out  Thou too unthinking fool must this hour bleed  Wou'd it were overthey may chance to wake  Thou Sleep still child of sablehooded Night

 Supplant them both the lover and the husband  He comes  Reenter MORTON  MORTON  Oh that the earth wou'd yawn and cover me  Or that Heaven's quickdevouring fires had shrunk  And wither'd up this arm when it was rais'd  Eyes eyes why clos'd you not e'er you beheld  The ghastly ruin  GREY  Speak direct are they dispos'd  MORTON  Awaythou hast destroy'd my peace for ever  Had you beheld him as he lay struggling  In the cold gripe of death his cheek o'erspread  With livid pale those eyes that late shot forth  So radiant now quite sunk their burning lamps  Extinct while from the deepmouth'd wound  As from a copious fountain issued forth  Life's purple springs  I wou'd have fled but horror for a space  Suspended every power  GREY  'Tis well  Hast thou then slain Lord Salisbury  At thy own

gav'st him credit  MORTON  This is strange  RAYMOND  Approve  I did not by the pow'rs of Truth I did not  Remorseless villainWhere where shall I hide  Me whither shall I flyOh deed of horror  Thy blood detested hireling shall in part  Compensate  MORTON  HoldHe cannot sure dissemble  Wish you my lord this deed were yet undone  RAYMOND  What wou'd the monsterOh cou'd I recall  His life by killing twenty thousand slaves  Like thee it were a comfort  MORTON  I believe  That you are innocent know then my lord  He liveshe sleeps and sleeps secure of harm  RAYMOND  Take heed thou dost not trifle  MORTON  I will confess  Me true and Heav'n forgive my foul intent  I undertook to slay this innocent  Approach'd him as a friendI saw his sufferings  Saw his distracted wife at length I curs'd  And in my heart abjur'd the wicked purpose  RAYMOND  Had'st thou the goodness Then perhaps  MORTON  I thought  Haply that you yourself might soon relent  This instrument of purpos'd cruelty  I took and with a fairdevised tale  Of Salisbury's death amus'd the guilty wretch  That would ensnare your quiet  RAYMOND  Is this honest  MORTON  Approach my lord approach and let your eye  Be witness of my truthIn doing thus  I thought I should be deem'd Lord Raymond's friend  RAYMOND  Thou wert the best of friendsRetire thou now  Exit  MOR  One way there yet remains to reconcile  This double war and

accumulated wrongs  That I do bleed withal Nor sea nor earth  Tho' thou should'st traverse her remotest climes  Shall shelter thee from my determin'd fury  RAYMOND  Think not that I shall fly thee or that I  Have sought thee now but on such terms as even  May challenge thy applause I come a foe  Indeed but I do come a generous foe  Lord SALISBURY  A generous foeThe brave indeed aspire  To generous acts their every thought looks up  And honour's dictates are their only function  But thouwhat terms woud'st thou propose What act  Of that essential virtue that may raze  The ignoble stains wherewith thou art polluted  RAYMOND  The ignoble▪ and the brave alike have err'd  And he that reascends to virtue's height  D  e  often snatch a wreath which never bloom'd  On safer wisdom's browFirst let me loose  Those ignominious bonds which have indeed  My own dishonour'd not the wearer's arm  Takes off his chains  Lord SALISBURY  Say to what purpose tends this honest seeming  RAYMOND  That I have wrong'd thee I confesstake this  Gives him a sword and draws another  The only restitution I have left  I know thou never canst forgive nor I  Forget the sword then judge between  Lord SALISBURY  Indeed  Lives there so much of honour then within thee  Spite of the mighty wrongs which thou hast done  Me I do thank thee  RAYMOND  Now Fortune mark her favourite  Loses his sword in the encounter  Then she is partial and I must submit  Lord SALISBURY  Take up thy sword again my fair revenge  Disdains too cheap a conquest  RAYMOND  'Tis too much  Oh generous generous even to cruelty  Some way I wou'd repay theeOh that I  Takes up his sword  Had never seen thy wifeIt may not be  Then let me tear for ever from my breast  The guilty passion thus I thank theethus  Wounds himself  Atone the mischiefs thatoh  Falls  Lord SALISBURY  This indeed  Atones for all Thou muchmisguided youth  What tempted thee to stray so wide from honour  RAYMOND  Ask ask that villain he will answer all  That
