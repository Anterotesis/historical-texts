 THE LIFE OF SIR THOMAS POPE FOUNDER OF TRINITY COLLEGE OXFORD CHIEFLY COMPILED FROM ORIGINAL EVIDENCES  WITH AN APPENDIX OF PAPERS NEVER BEFORE PRINTED  THE SECOND EDITION CORRECTED AND ENLARGED  BY THOMAS WARTON BD FELLOW OF TRINITY COLLEGE AND FSA  LONDON PRINTED FOR THOMAS CADELL IN THE STRAND MDCCLXXX  PREFACE  BIOGRAPHERS in the pursuit of information are naturally betrayed into minute researches The curiosity of the reader is seldom proportioned to that of the writer in this species of composition Every incident relating to a favourite character which the mind has long contemplated with attention acquires importance On these principles we may venture to found a plausible excuse for the many trifling discoveries and intricate discussions of insignificant circumstances with which personal history so much abounds  To this apology which every biographer has a right to plead the writer of the following memoirs presumes he possesses a peculiar  claim arising from his situation and connections He describes the life of a person whom the strongest principles of gratitude implanted in early years have habitually taught him to regard with united veneration and affection Under these circumstances the slightest events appear interesting and the most frivolous anecdotes of such a life are investigated with a pleasing enthusiasm  In the mean time a want of materials might have justly been here alledged in extenuation of an objection so constantly urged against works of this kind It will readily be granted that to record the lives of men who have adorned their country by monuments of munificence is a tribute indispensably due to public merit and which cannot without public injustice be witheld But to discharge this duty even imperfectly and by those means however inadequate which the utmost exertions of diligent enquiry can afford is less unpardonable than to neglect  it entirely When we cannot recover a perfect portrait of our friend and our benefactor we must be contented with a few faint outlines Abundance only implies rejection and where but little can be collected it is necessary to retain every thing We must acquiesce in anecdotes of inconsiderable consequence while those of more importance cannot be procured  These inconveniencies might have easily been prevented But our ancestors had no regard for futurity They trusted the remembrances of their heroes to chance and tradition or rather to the laborious investigation of a distant posterity For it is the task of modern times to commemorate if they cannot imitate the conspicuous examples of antiquity and to compose the panegyric of those virtues which exist no more Inquisitive leisure is not the lot of earlier eras Ages of action are succeeded by ages of enquiry  But that species of enquiry which properly belongs to the biographer seems in point of time to be posteriour to that which forms the province of the historian It does not grow fashionable till late it begins to be the favourite amusement of cultivated nations at their most polished periods When the more important and extensive stores of historical information have been exhausted the growing spirit of curiosity which increases in proportion as it is gratified still demands new gratifications it descends to particularities and delights to develope circumstances of a subordinate nature After many general histories have been written inquisitive minds are eager to explore the parts of what they have hitherto surveyed at large The ardour of research which gathers strength from contraction is exerted on distinct periods and at length personal history commences Characters before only represented in the gross and but incidentally exhibited  or superficially displayed now become the subject of critical disquisition and a separate examination Occurences neglected or omitted by the historian form materials for the biographer and men of superiour eminence are selected from the common mass of public transactions in which they were indistinctly grouped and delineated as detatched figures in a single point of view  Nor was it till late after the restoration of literature that biography assumed its proper form and appeared in its genuine character The Lives which were compiled at some distance after that period are extremely jejune and defective performances The first which approached to perfection were those of Peireskius by Peter Gassendus and of Melancthon by Camerarius It was long before the perseverance of investigation connected with precision the patient toil of tracing evidences authenticating facts and digesting scattered notices grew into a science in a  word before the accuracy of the antiquarian was engrafted on the researches of the biographer The masterly Life of William of Wykeham will best explain and illustrate these reflections a work which I chuse to produce as an example on this occasion not only because it is here produced as an example with a peculiar degree of propriety but because it is a pattern of that excellence in this mode of writing which I mean to characterise and recommend  As sir Thomas Pope bore some share in the national transactions of his time to relieve the dryness of personal and local incidents I have endeavoured to render these pages in some measure interesting to general readers by dilating this part of my performance and by sometimes introducing historical digressions yet resulting immediately from the tenour of my subject Amongst these I flatter myself that my relation of the persecutions of the princess Elizabeth may merit  some attention of which I have thrown together a more uniform and circumstantial detail than has yet appeared with the addition of several anecdotes respecting that transaction not hitherto published  On the whole I may venture to affirm that I have at least attempted to make my work as entertaining as possible My materials have not always been of the most brilliant kind but they are such as have often enabled me to enliven and embellish my narrative by presenting pictures of antient manners which are ever striking to the imagination  I have before hinted that my resources for compiling this history were slender and insufficient From books I could obtain scarce any information Indeed my chief assistance has been derived from manuscript authorities I have not however in this respect found the success I wished Yet I have carefully consulted every record that seemed  likely to illustrate my subject and my references will shew that I have searched a variety of authentic instruments preserved in the British Museum the chapel of the Rolls and other repositories of valuable originals Of these the more important are printed at large in the Appendix  Among my references to manuscript authorities two sometimes occur which require explanation These are  MSS Cotton Vitellius  F  MSS Strype  And  MSS F Wise  In the year that industrious and accurate annalist Mr John Strype communicated to doctor Arthur Charlett master of University college originally fellow of Trinity college an account of the Funeral of sir Thomas Pope  See Ballard's Coll of Letters MSS Bibl Bodl fol xv pag Letter from Strype to Charlett dated Lowlayton Essex Apr See LIFE infr p  This account Strype had transcribed from a manuscript of the  Cotton library which he perpetually cites in in his ECCLESIASTICAL MEMOIRS marked  Vitellius  F  In a letter from Strype to Charlett dat ibid Apr MSS ut supr vol xv p  "The kindness you bear to the foundation of Trinity college makes me inquisitive into the Founder's place of burial which you find mentioned in my ANNALS p edit i Though I cannot easily recollect every manuscript and particular place in them whence I have compiled every part of the history Yet it occurs to me that sir THOMAS POPE's Funeral with the time and place as also the rest of pages viz the funerals in those pages mentioned were taken from the volume VITELLIUS F in the Cotton library which is a certain brief journal of funeral  and as well of divers other occurrences beginning at the year written as it seems by some herald or other diligent observer of his own times There the writer sets down all the particular ceremonies the solemnities and mourners at that knight's interment Which if you have any desire to know I will transcribe out of my notes and send you"  This is an original Then follows the letter before referred to which is not the original but a transcript by the late Mr Rawlins of Pophills in Gloucestershire who became possessed of Charlett's extensive correspondence See APPEND p infr  Soon afterwards it appears that Strype sent to Charlett perhaps at his request a few other notices relating to sir Thomas Pope extracted from the same manuscript  The late learned Mr Francis Wise keeper of the archives Radclivian librarian and fellow of Trinity college at Oxford copied all the transcripts about four or five in number which Strype on this occasion had made from the Cotton manuscript by permission of Charlett among whose curious and numerous papers they were kept and by Mr Wise they were thus communicated to me Fortunately for the present undertaking the extracts had been made by Strype before the fire happened in the Cotton library then placed in Ashburnham house at Westminster by which fatal accident this valuable volume was particularly damaged and as far as I can judge from a cursory inspection most of the leaves if not all containing Strype's extracts were either destroyed or obliterated  But see APPEND Numb xxviii  The reader is therefore desired to observe that the reference viz  MSS Cotton Vitell  F  MSS Strype  signifies  Strype's transcripts from thence  See pp  But whenever this Cotton manuscript is cited without the addition of  MSS Strype  the reader will remember that such citations were faithfully transcribed by myself from that manuscript volume now belonging to the British Museum  Mr Wise also transcribed and communicated to me two or three other papers from doctor Charlett's collections beside those of Strype which I have just mentioned  See pp And APPEND Numb xxix  These I have called  MSS F Wise  Since my first edition among the manuscript papers of the Rev Thomas Wilkes DD fellow of Trinity college Oxford and who died rector of Rotherfield Greys in Oxfordshire in I have met with other notices by Mr Wise which are now first inserted in this edition and are also styled MSS F Wise These Mr Wise seems to have had chiefly from Dr Charlett's collections and the familypapers of the late sir Harry PopeBlount  As to Charlett's collections I learn that he derived many of his notices and informations on this subject from Mr Josiah Howe a fellow of the college a short account of whom will not be superfluous as it may tend to establish their credit He was born at Crendon in Bucks and elected Scholar of Trinity

cathedral Oxford The sermon was printed and in red letters by the king's special command Only thirty copies were printed One was purchased in by Hearne from Dr Charlett's library the same and that

soon afterwards ejected from his Fellowship by the presbyterians but not in the general expulsion in according to Walker SUFF CLERG p Being one of the Bursars of the college and foreseeing its fate having resolved at the same time never to acknowledge the authority of Cromwell's visitors he retired in the beginning of the year to a collegeestate in Buckinghamshire carrying with him many rentals rolls papers and other authentic documents belonging to his office He was invited to return to the college by Dr Harris the new presbyterian President on a promise that if he would quietly give up the official books his submission to the visitors should be dispensed with and he should be permitted to retain his fellowship without molestation Harris by this artifice having recovered the books immediately signed an order for Howe's expulsion pretending to have received an unexpected injunction from the visitors and professing his regret at being obliged to remove so valuable a member from the foundation Hearne MSS COLL vol p He was restored to his fellowship in He has a Copy of recommendatory English verses prefixed to the folio edition of Beaumont and Fletcher printed in Another to Thomas Randoph's POEMS reprinted at Oxford in Another to Cartwright's COMEDIES and POEMS at Oxford These pieces in the witty epigrammatic style which then prevailed have uncommon acuteness and highly deserve to be revived Some others have perhaps escaped me In those I have mentioned he appears in company with Denham Waller Jonson Corbett Brome Shirley Mayne and others the most ingenious men of those times who were of his intimate acquaintance Wood says that he wrote a copy of Englishe verses which were much applauded spoken before the duke and duchess of York in at Trinity college MSS Mus

Yate of Stanford Berks which place Wood seems to have confounded with  Sandford  a village in Woottonhundred Many of the family of Yate appear to have lived in and about the villages of Charney Buckland and Stanford Berks and Stanlake Oxfordshire places all of the same neighbourhood What still further confirms my supposition that Wood is mistaken and that the said Edmund Yate of Stanlake was Margaret Pope's father is that Peter Yate of Stanlake whom Sir Thomas Pope in a letter dat calls his cousin appears to have been a tenant to Trinity college Oxford In indentur dat Jul I find likewise one Barthol Yate co Berks who I presume was of some of the places abovementioned or from that neighbourhood elected scholar of the said college in Ex registr prim dicti coll fol But it would be

hereafter  concerning all which I shall speak more at large hereafter  William and Margaret Pope seem to have lived in a decent and creditable condition as may be collected from the bequests of William's will which also partly shews the circumstances in which his eldest  See Append I  son was left He bequeathes his land to be divided between  his wife and his son THOMAS  I find that Sir Thomas Pope sold the manor of Dedington with other possessions in the neighbourhood to K Henry viii by indent dat Mar an reg But the premisses were nopaternal estate of the Popes having been granted

college at Oxford  "Ex scholis Etonensi vel Banburiensi in quibus Ipse olim in grammaticae rudimentis educatus eram"  Cap vii  but I do not find that he completed his education at either of our universities  It seems most probable that he was immediately sent from Eton school to some of the inns of court I believe to Gray'sinn That he was bred to the law is certain and there is undoubted evidence that he was employed while very young in some of the inferior offices of the court of chancery  Apud Lit pat Hen vii an reg inf citat viz  "Grandes labores laudabiliaque obsequia quae dilectus nobis THOMAS POPE attendens negociis nostris in Cancellaria nostra predicta multipliciter impendebat indiesque impendere intendebat merito contemplantes c"  See Append No V  And that he was originally destined and regularly trained to this profession may be conjectured from his handwriting many specimens of which remain in his college at Oxford Nor is it improbable that he might be placed in his youth for some time at least under the superintendence and instruction of some skilful practitioner in the law perhaps a master in chancery as in his will he bequeathes to his  old

Sir Thomas More for the satisfaction of the judges and his own justification to make a docquet of all the Injunctions which he had given to the law courts during the time of his chancellorship  More's Life by M T M p to    But whatever was our young adventurer's situation in early life it is remarkable that a person of his obscure family and inconsiderable fortune should so soon recommend himself to public notice and gain access even to the royal favour Vigorous abilities and an active mind easily surmounted all obstacles and he quickly became a successful candidate in the pursuit of riches and honour  What was the first step to his advancement in life and whether it arose from the friendship of some private patron from any distinguished merit in his profession a peculiar cast for business in general or a lucky concurrence of all these causes cannot be precisely determined although from what follows it may be partly conjectured He was not much more than twentyseven years of age when he had sufficient address or interest to procure an appointment to offices which seem to have been alternately bestowed upon Henry's most eminent favourites and the most popular characters of those times  Fuller in his quaint manner observes concerning him  "I behold him as fortunae suae fabrum the smith who by God's blessing hammered out his own fortune without any patrimonial advantage"  Worthies of England Article London p edit    Having been early initiated as I before observed in the business of chancery on the fifth day October he was constituted by letters patent of Henry the eighth clerk of the briefs in the starchamber at Westminster  See Append No IV  On the fifteenth day of October in the same year he received by letters patent of the same king a reversionary grant of the office of clerk  of the crown in chancery Of this post very soon afterwards he became actually possessed with an annual fee of twenty pounds from the hanaper and also a robe with fur at the feasts of Christmas and Pentecost from the king's great wardrobe  Pat Hen viii par See Append No V    On the thirteenth day of November he was constituted by the king's letters patent warden of the mint exchange and coinage in the tower of London on the voluntary resignation in his favour of John Coppynger page of the great wardrobe  Pat Hen viii par See Append No III See more of John Coppynger ibid in the Notes  How long he continued in this office I have not learned It seems however that he had quitted it within eight years and as I suppose for some more valuable consideration  For in the British Museum there is  "Compotus Johannis Browne custodis Cambii c a primo die Jul an reg Hen viii "  MSS Harl  On the twentythird day of December he was likewise by letters patent appointed to exercise jointly with William Smythe the office of clerk of all the briefs in the starchamber at Westminster  Pat Hen viii par Append No IV    On February the twentyeighth he obtained at his own instance a new royal licence for exercising the office of clerk of the crown in conjunction with John Lucas  Pat Hen viii ut supr  who was afterwards in the reign of Edward the sixth an eminent crownlawyer and employed by that prince in many important commissions  Strype Eccl Mem ii And ibid B ii Ch xxix pass  The first of these grants he perhaps obtained by the recommendation of Sir Thomas More who presiding as Lord Chancellor in the court abovementioned where Sir Thomas Pope was employed when a young man might have taken particular notice of his promising diligence and abilities and from which circumstance a lasting friendship and intimacy between them both as will be shewn hereafter seems to have originally commenced Although there is equal reason to suppose as it will likewise appear in its proper place that he was in no less favour and esteem with Sir Thomas More's successor the Lord Chancellor Thomas lord Audley under whose immediate inspection and authority he exercised the office of clerk of the crown and clerk of the briefs in the starchamber and to both of which  departments as I presume he must have been appointed by Lord Chancellor Audley's nomination  Lord Audley was appointed Lord Keeper May on the resignation of Sir T More And Lord Chancellor Jan Rym Foed xiv Dugd Chron Ser pag Both offices I apprehend were in the appointment of the Chancellor as the clerk of the crown is at present although they passed in the king's name The starchamber was a branch of chancery Among Tanner's manuscripts there is an instrument without date but while Audley was chancellor relating to the monastery of Furness in Sir T Pope's handwriting MSS TANNER f Bibl Bodl    But these appointments were soon succeeded by one of much greater consequence For in the year he was constituted by the king Treasurer of the Court of augmentations of the king's revenue on its first establishment by act of parliament  Statut Hen viii An Cap xxvii See STATUTES by Berthelette in two vol Lond See vol ii ibid fol xli b    The principal design of this court was for estimating the lands of the dissolved monasteries vested in the Crown and for receiving their revenues It had moreover full power and authority to sell the monastic possessions for the king's service  From the act  It was so called from the encrease which the royal revenue received  by this new acquisition of property All persons holding leases and pensions by former grants from any convent exhibited their titles before this court and their pretensions were allowed in proportion to their validity And although the governors of the religious houses foreseein their fate often contrived immediately before the dissolution of their respective societies to forge new contracts or indentures in favour of their friends or kindred few frauds of this kind took effect For the court seems to have been very vigilant in preventing and exposing such specious impostures  Fuller Ch Hist B vi p    The officers of this court were a Chancellor it's superior a Treasurer abovementioned who was the second officer a sollicitor ten auditors seventeen recievers with others belonging to the inferior departments It was a court of record and possessed of two seals  From the Act of parl ut sup    The Treasurer's office appears to have been a post of considerable profit and distinction and of equal trust and importance He was ranked with the principal officers of state in the reign of Henry the eighth For by statute of the same he was privileged together with  the chancellor of the said court the chancellor of the dutchy of Lancaster the treasurer of the king's chamber the chancellor of the court of first Fruits and Tenths the master of the king's wards and liveries the groom of the stole the warden of the cinque ports and other honourable personages respectively to retain in his house one chaplain having a benefice with cure of souls who should not be compelled to residence  Statut Hen

annuity granted under the seal of the court and also for such disbursements as he made to any other persons by virtue of the king's warrant or bill assigned or by bill assigned and subscribed by the chancellor and one other officer  These fees were regulated according to the practice of the court of the dutchy of Lancaster  Ex Statut ut supr  The allowance of Sir John Williams afterwards Lord Williams of Tame Treasurer of this court in the reign of Edward the sixth was l A sum which I presume was  then the full value of this place  Fuller Ch Hist b vi p edit In lieu of this salary queen

dissolved monasteries concerning which he accounted annually before the chancellor and two auditors The chaneellor Treasurer attorney and sollicitor or any two of them were entrusted with power or licence to act without the king's warrant  Ex Statut ut supr    On the dissolution of any greater abbey some of the auditors who were employed in riding to survey the manors and lands of the court

the honor of knighthood  Brit Mus MSS Cotton Claudius C fol b    A few years after the erection of the court of augmentations abovementioned the king perceiving that his exigencies required more expeditious returns of money than the annual revenues of the dissolved monasteries could produce was necessitated to sell by one extensive commission a very considerable part of their lands for the purpose of raising present supplies By this step the court of augmentations was soon diminished The causes depending in it became few and inconsiderable and the crownprofits arising from thence decreased it's officers were numerous and their pensions ample On these considerations he was induced to dissolve it which he did by letters patent only and on the second of January created by the same letters patent a new court of augmentations on a different and more confined plan  In an original rough draught of this new establishment  In the British Museum MSS Harl  Sir Thomas Pope is nominated by the king master of the woods of the court  on this side the river Trent and Sir John Williams Treasurer The other principal patentofficers recited in the instrument are Sir Edward North who is appointed chancellor Sir Walter Mildmay and Sir Thomas Moyle general surveyors Robert Henneage master of the woods beyond Trent Richard Goodricke attorney and John Gosnold sollicitor The rest are Geoffry Gates and John Arnscott surveyors of the woods on each side Trent and Richard Duke The two masters of the woods on each side Trent are styled the fourth officers At this time Sir Thomas Pope was one of the king's privycounsellors  He is styled in the said instrument  "our trustie and well belovyd counsaillor"  fol b The first notice I have found of his being a privy counsellor occurs

amounted to l s d  Fuller Ch hist vi p    In the year the last of the reign of Edward the sixth the first effort was made for the actual abolition of this court which by degrees was become burthensome

volumes fol MSS Harl They are the originals  which the learned and accurate Wanley supposed to have belonged to the court of augmentations But this could not be the case as the first of them was made

Exchequer where the augmentationrecords are at present reposited is not the same Which was the court of wards and consequently which was the augmentation court will appear by comparing the following passage of Stowe who wrote in the reign of queen Elisabeth  "At the upper end of the great Westminster hall by the  King's Bench  is a going up to a great chamber called the  Whitehall  wherein is now

for dissolving the religious houses It is indeed true that he was one of those into whose hands the seal of the magnificent and opulent abbey of Saint Alban's was surrendered on the fifth day of December by the last abbot Richard Stevenache  Stevens's Monasticon i Weever's Fun mon p edit  This however is the only instance I can find that he was ever concerned in this sort of business His name does not appear among the persons specially appointed by Cromwell for this purpose whose names are recited by Dugdale  Warwickshire p seq  from an authentic manuscript in the  Cotton Library Nor does his name occur in the private commissions which after a diligent search I have seen relating to this matter nor in any instruments of resignation letters of advice to the visitor general memorials or other authentic papers concerning the visitation or suppression of any monastery My opinion is therefore that he was only occasionally employed at Saint Alban's as being one of the principal officers in the court of augmentations as the place was in the neighbourhood of London and as the surrender of so famous an abbey was an affair of some importance Thus we find that the priory now the dean and chapter of Canterbury was not dissolved in the ordinary way it being thought necessary that the archbishop of Canterbury the master of the rolls Walter Henley attorney and Nicholas Bacon sollicitor of the augmentationcourt with four others should be sent thither to take the resignation of the prior and monks  Somner's CANTERBURY by Batteley Append p It was Hen viii  However if it can be proved that he was ever engaged on other occasions in these violent proceedings of an avaricious and arbitrary prince it may at the same time be fairly presumed that in an employment which afforded so many obvious temptations to fraud oppression and rapacity  he behaved with singular decency moderation and honour Of this we have the impartial evidence of a prejudiced historian For Fuller who is remarkably severe on the visitors in general and who is seldom sparing of his invectives wherever he can discover the slightest foundation for abuse mentioning Sir Thomas Pope as an agent in these affairs immediately subjoins  "However by all the printed books of that age he appeareth one of a candid carriage and in this respect stands sole and single by himself That of the abbeylands which he received he refunded a considerable proportion for the building and endowing Trinity college in Oxford  Worthies London p  "  And in another place he mentions him with honour on the same subject  "But the most pleasant object to entertain us at this time in England is the beholding of two fair and fresh foundations in Oxford the one Trinity college built by Sir Thomas Pope  principal visitor  at the dissolution of abbies  This is a mistake as we have before seen  Now as none were losers employed in that service so we find few refunding back to charitable uses and perchance this man alone the

architecture remaining in England  It was built by Paulin the fourteenth abbot a Norman about the Year    On the whole the circumstance of his having received grants of the lands of the monasteries seems to have occasioned the mistaken supposition that he was frequently and professedly concerned as a Commissioner in the dissolution of their foundations That his prodigious property was accumulated in consequence of the destruction of the religious houses is not denied and the lucky oportunity of raising an estate from this grand harvest of riches which now lay open before him seems to have diverted his thoughts from making a fortune by the law a profession which he most probably would have otherwise continued to cultivate with the greatest success and in which he might have undoubtedly claimed the most opulent and distinguished stations I could give a minute detail from the most authentic evidences of the grants of abbeyland which he  recieved during the reign of Henry the eighth but it may suffice to observe in more general terms that before the year he appears to have been actually possessed of more than thirty manors in Oxfordshire Gloucestershire Warwickshire Derbyshire Bedfordshire Herefordshire and Kent beside other considerable estates and several advowsons Some of these possessions were given him by Henry the eighth but the greatest part was acquired by purchase while he was connected with the court of augmentations  See Dugdale's Warwickshire And from the patents  Many of his estates were bought of Queen Mary  Ex muniment coll praedict And lib

Cap vi Afterwards he made other acquisitions    But let us suppose what indeed cannot be proved that Sir Thomas Pope was one of Cromwell's visitors in the affair of the monasteries For although I have insinuated above that these visitors were not on all occasions entirely justifiable in their proceedings I am yet  inclined to think that their conduct and behaviour were in general less blameable than has been commonly represented  It is no wonder that the monks should load those whom they esteemed the instruments of their ruin with many calumnies all which were studiously propagated and heightened by their advocates of the catholic persuasion And it should at the same time be remembered that the king's injunctions under which they acted were extremely severe insomuch that many fraternities desired their houses might be rather entirely suppressed than reformed under such rigorous conditions  With regard to the vices and disorders  Even in the Nunneries where among the softer sex some degree of delicacy at least of decorum might have justly been expected the lowest vices not to insist on the more criminal irregularities were too often practised In the Benedictine convent of Rumsey in Hamshire at a visitation by Bishop Fox held in the year Joyce Rows the abbess is accused of immoderate Drinking especially  "tempore nocturno"  and of inviting the nuns to her chamber every evening for the purpose of these excesses  "post completorium"  The nuns are also forbidden to have such frequent and familiar access at undue times to the house of the bailiff or chief hind of the monastery whence unfavourable suspicions have arisen and the said bailiff himself is ordered no more to frequent the chambers of the abbess or nuns Some of them are enjoined to abstain  "a societate sacerdotum"  and the abbess in particular is commanded to avoid all communications with Seculars especially with some whose names are expressly mentioned and who are known to have  "accessum et recursum ad Eam"  One of the injunctions to the nuns in general is  "  Quòa sint  sobriae  et se abstineant a  potu  post Completcrium  "  Apud Registr Fox Episc Wint Lib i fol b This was a rich convent and filled with ladies of the best families  which they pretended to have detected in the  monasteries their reports sometimes perhaps deserve credit as those enormities are too naturally and unavoidably connected with the monastic institution In this as in all other cases of that sort mutual opposition produced mutual obloquy  Nor should it be forgotten that the visitors gave a favorable report of some houses They interceded earnestly for the nunnery of Godstowe in Oxfordshire declaring that the nuns were strict in their lives and alledging that the suppression of this house would prove an irreparable inconvenience as most of the young ladies of the best families of that county were sent thither for education  Burnet Reformat i This was common in other nunneries Tanner from the accounts of the cellaress of Carhow near Norwich gives us a curious specimen of what was received  "pro perhendinationibus"  or the board of young ladies and their servants for education  "  Rec  de

the strongest terms for the absolute continuance of the monastery of Woolstrope in Lincolnshire I will insert the words of his letter to Cromwell not only because they contain an unexpected instance

been summoned and examined by the privy council concerning certain treasonable expressions which had dropped from Thomas duke of Norfolk afterwards condemned with lord Surrey but not executed in reference to the Act of Uses  Herbert's Hist Hen viii p edit The historian says  "  One  Thomas Pope informed the council c"  It may therefore be doubted whether he means sir Thomas Pope But it is the same in Masters's  Text  of this history in Jesus college library MSS No vol  He was a singular and most intimate friend of sir Thomas More who seems to have taken early notice of him as I before hinted when a young man in the court of chancery and was sent by the king to notify to that illustrious sufferer in the cause of mistaken conscience the hour appointed for his execution  As the interview between these two friends on this important occasion is memorable and interesting I shall insert it at length  On the fifth day of July  See More's WORKES fol pag  he waited on sir Thomas More then under condemnation in the Tower early in the morning and acquainted him that he came by command of the king and council to bring his unfortunate friend the melancholy news that he must suffer death before nine of the clock the same morning and that therefore he should immediately begin to prepare himself for that aweful event Upon this message More without the least surprize or emotion chearfully replied  "Master Pope I most heartily thank you for your good tidings I have been much bound to the king's highness for the benefits of his honors that he hath most bountifully bestowed upon me yet am I more bound to his grace I assure you for putting me here where I have had convenient time and space to have remembrance of my end And so help me god Most of all am I bound unto him that it hath pleased his majesty so shortly to rid me out of the miseries of this wicked world"  Then Pope subjoined that  it was the king's pleasure that at the place of execution he should not use many words To this More answered that he was ready to submit to the king's commands and added  "I beseech you good Mr Pope to gett the king to suffer my daughter Margaret to be present at my burial"  Pope assured him that he would use his utmost interest with the king for this purpose and having now finished his disagreeable commission he solemnly took leave of his dying friend and burst into tears More perceiving his concern said with his usual composure  "Quiet yourself good Mr Pope and be not discomforted for I trust that we shall one day in heaven see each other full merrily where we shall be sure to live and love together in joyful bliss eternally  Roper's Life of More by T Hearne  "  But this method of consolation proving ineffectual More to divert the melancholy of his friend and to dismiss him in better spirits called for a glass and applying it as an urinal he held it up to the light and with the prophetic air of a sagacious physician gravely declared  "This man might have lived longer if it had pleased the king  Thomae Mori Vita et Exitus by J H gent Lond pag  "  In consequence of sir Thomas Pope's intercession with the king agreeably to More's earnest and dying request his favorite daughter Margaret Roper and others of his family were permitted to be present at his interment which was performed immediately after the execution in the chapel of the Tower But Margaret afterwards and probably by the same interest begged the body of the king and deposited it on the southside of the choir of the church of Chelsea where a monument with an inscription written by himself had been erected some time before This affectionate daughter whose resolution equals her pity also found means to procure her father's head after it had remained ignominiously stuck on a pole on London bridge for fourteen days For this daring fact she was apprehended and imprisoned but declaring in her defence before the privy council that she had bought it that it might not in

of Edward the sixth when the religious and political affairs of the kingdom took another turn and all public business fell into the hands of new ministers and managers sir Thomas Pope did not comply with the times He was appointed to no office nor enjoyed any favor in this reign He received indeed some grants of land from the crown about the first year of this king with Cranmer archbishop of Canterbury the duke of Somerset the earl of Warwick the marquis of Northampton and several other principal persons of the court But these grants were made for past services and in consideration of other claims due from the deceased king  Strype Eccl Mem ii Some of the particulars may perhaps be seen in pat Edw vi test Jul par Likewise in this reign sir Richard Leigh is licenced to alienate a manor to sir T Pope pat Edw vi test Maii par Sir T Pope is licenced to alienate a pasture in Bermondsey to Will Gerrard pat Edw vi test Jan par Sir T Pope is licenced to alienate the manor of Broughton co Oxon to William Godolphin and Henry Boothe pat Edw vi test Sept par These are all the patents of any sort which he received in this reign    The unlimited authority and arbitrary dominion of Henry had kept both protestants and papists in subjection Under such a government they both acted uniformly and neither party presumed to claim any apparent superiority But upon the decease of that uncontroulable monarch the people discovered their real sentiments without reserve and protestantism manifestly began to be the prevailing religion The protector Somerset who had long been a secret partisan of the reformers on the accession of young Edward publicly declared his intention of forwarding and establishing the reformation In this scheme he was happily seconded by most of the privy council who after the fall of Southampton seem entirely to have deserted the catholic communion The protector wisely took care that all persons to whom he entrusted the education of the young king should be attached to these rational principles and preferred and encouraged those alone that appeared active in this profession  Thus most of the courtiers yet more perhaps in general from lucrative views than from real conviction became converts to the predominant party amongst which however I do not find sir Thomas Pope This at least  shews a steadiness and uniformity of mind in those days of change which afford such frequent instances of occasional compliance  Nor let it be deemed any inconsistency of character that he though a rigid papist should have been in the preceding reign an agent for suppressing the monasteries and a receiver of their possessions For the demolition of these houses was not an act of the church but of the state It was prior to the reformation of religion and effected by a king and parliament of the popish communion It was even confirmed by the parliament of queen Mary  Statut Phil Mar cap viii inf citat    Very few papists wrote or remonstrated against the destruction of these societies Without the least impeachment of their principles or suspicion of apostacy several others the strictest members of the catholic persuasion and the most respectable characters of those times among which to mention no more was the duke of Norfolk accepted grants of the conventual estates  Even the clergy thought it no sacrilege to share in these acquisitions The

bishops of the protestant church proved afterwards in the reigns of Edward the sixth and Elizabeth The bishop of Chichester in opening the disputation of Henry the eighth  with Lambert in Westminsterhall ranked the king's disincorporation of the monks with his rejection of the see of Rome his abolition of idolatrous adoration and the introduction of the English bible as a matter of an external nature and in no respect interfering with the essentials of the catholic communion  See MSS C C C C cxxvii  The monastic institution was no part of the papistic theology Undoubtedly the suppression of the convents facilitated the admission of protestatism but it was evidently undertaken on other principles  When queen Mary succeeded to the throne sir Thomas Pope was again taken into favour and soon afterwards constituted one of the queen's privy counsellors  Hollingshead iii Speed  He is likewise said to have been appointed cofferer to the houshold  MSS Rawlins bibl Bodl History of Oxfordshire  Wroxton  But it does not appear by the patents And Richard Freston is made cofferer pat Phil Mar par    But before I proceed further in this reign it may be proper to obviate some seeming difficulties and inconsistences by premising on what security sir Thomas Pope together with many others held his churchrevenues under  a bigotted catholic queen and upon the restoration of the popish religion By way of procuring new concessions in favour of Rome and to prevent unseasonable alarms at the beginning of this reign both the queen and the pope had given repeated assurances that the church and abbey lands should remain forever unreclaimed in the hands of their present possessors  Heylin Eccle rest p  But that the tenure of these possessions should not be fixed on so precarious a foundation as that of mere promises in an act of parliament was passed which while it restored the pope's authority gave absolute security to the proprictors of the ecclesiastical estates entirely confirmed their title beyond the power of resumption and at the same time exempted them from the danger of spiritual censures  Statut Phil Mar cap viii  In the mean time that this measure might receive the fullest sanction cardinal Pole who was invested by the pope with legantine jurisdiction ratified the parliament's decree and that the dispensation might be still more ample and effectual in consequence of his master's commission the legate ensured even the property of future acquisitions of church lands to the present receivers  Ibid And Strype Eccl Mem iii seq See also Harl miscell vii p    Thus an equivalent was granted on both sides The nobility and gentry were settled in the quiet enjoyment of their estates and the pope although most essentially weakened by the alienation of that wealth on which his power so much depended was reinstated in his supremacy over the church  During this reign sir Thomas Pope was often employed in commissions of consequence On the twentyninth day of July he was commissioned by the council together with sir Arthur Darcy and others  Burghley's State papers by Haynes p  to apprehend lord Russel Anthony Browne of Essex and several accomplices concerned in the duke of Northumberland's insurrection who on the death of Edward had raised an army with an intent to place the lady Jane Gray on the throne before Mary was proclaimed

discretion either of monies taken up for Edward the sixth or for the present queen For this business sir Thomas Pope was admirably qualified from that knowledge and experience in stating extensive and complicated accounts which he must have acquired while he was concerned in the court of Augmentations And for the same reason in the succeeding reign sir Walter Mildmay was deputed by the lords to make a general inquisition of the royal revenue  Strype Ann Ref i sect ii    This expedient of borrowing money at an exorbitant interest of the merchants of Antwerp was a measure which Mary was obliged to put in practice more than once  Councilbook MSS Brit Mus ut supr  And it had been to her honor if she had used no worse For indeed the chief object of government which for some time engaged her attention was to raise large sums by the most irregular methods or to extort money from her subjects She sometimes endeavoured to recruit her exhausted exchequer by retrenching the public expences at home She demolished several forts on the river below Gravesend which were filled with superfluous garrisons she broke all the body guards half the band of pensioners the gentlemen of the stables and the pages of honor and proposed to disband the hundred archers of the guard But to frugality she added oppression and her unhappy necessities frequently compelled her to the most violent and unjustifiable experiments She levied sixty thousand marks from seven thousand yeomen and thirtysix thousand pounds from the merchants This was exacted because they had not contributed to a former loan of sixty thousand pounds levied on a thousand persons in  whose compliance either on account of their loyalty or their riches she firmly confided But that tax not being found sufficient she exacted a general loan of an hundred pounds each on all who possessed an annual income of twenty pounds This imposition obliged many of the gentry to reduce their domestic expences and to dismiss many of their servants that they might at least more prudently comply with her commands And as these servants having no means of subsistence by too common a transition from that state of idleness betook themselves to theft and robbery the queen knew no better method of redressing the grievance than to publish a proclamation obliging their former masters to take them back to their services In order to gratify the city of London for past favors and to engage them to assist her with future supplies she issued an edict at their instance prohibiting for four months the exportation of English clothes into Flanders By this iniquitous combination a good market was procured in that country for such as had already sent thither large quantities of that sort of merchandise  Carte iii    Her extravagancies proved a perpetual obstruction to the commercial interests of the  kingdom Her own bigottry was not always a sufficient restraint on her conscience to prevent her from exposing to sale the revenues  See supr pag  of that church in defence of which she had sacrificed in the flames so many victims But it would be endless and impertinent here to mention at large her multiplied extortions and the various imprudent or fraudulent schemes which her exigencies invented for obtaining money It may be sufficient to add that these expedients were employed not to carry on an expensive war for she was in profound peace with all the world nor to promote the national welfare by any new establishments or improvements but to satisfy the unjust demands of a husband who slighted her love neglected her interests and solely consulted his own convenience  On this occasion one cannot help observing the weakness of the human mind under the most powerful and importunate of passions Mary regarded her husband Philip with all the fondness and sollicitude of an uncertain lover This attachment produced strange contradictions in her sentiments and behaviour She was naturally too phlegmatic to be profuse yet from a penurious and economical habit  of mind she suddenly became rapacious and expensive She persecuted the reformed with the most barbarous severities yet alienated the riches assigned to support her favorite superstitions In this situation she was at once deserted by that cold and stoical inflexibility which distinguishes her character and the sedate and gloomy queen suffered herself to be betrayed into greater inconsistencies of conduct than even the most unaccountable caprice of her father Henry could have dictated  Before the reign of queen Mary it was the common practice with our English princes to have recourse to the city of Antwerp for voluntary loans and we generally find their credit so low that they were obliged to engage the city of London to join in the security But this business seems never to have been so effectually conducted as by that publicspirited and enterprizing merchant sir Thomas Gresham who began to be employed in this agency by Edward the sixth  See Burghley's State papers by Haynes p And Ward's Life of Gresham p  He was likewise employed by queen Elizabeth for the same purpose one of whose first steps at her accession was to procure money She  sent Gresham to Antwerp to borrow two hundred thousand pounds in order to enable her to reform the coinage at that time extremely debased But as a most sensible and acute historian observes  Hume hist Eliz p edit  she was so impolitic as to make herself an innovation in the coin by dividing a pound of silver into sixtytwo shillings instead of sixty the former standard  In the year on the eighth of February sir Thomas Pope was joined by the queen in a famous commission for the more effectual suppression of heretics  Burner's Reformation Coll of records part ii b ii p  "Having special trust and confidence in your fidelities wisdoms and discretions c"  in concert with Bonner bishop of London Thirlby bishop of Ely the Lords Windsor and North secretary Bourne sir John Mordaunt sir Francis Englefield sir Edward Waldegrave sir Nicholas Hare sir Roger Cholmeley sir Richard Read sir Thomas Stradling sir Rowland Hill serjeant Rastall Cole dean of saint Paul's William Cooke Thomas Martin John Story and John Vaughan doctors of law and William Roper and Ralph Cholmeley esquires These commissioners were empowered to enquire after all persons suspected of heretical  opinions to search for and seize seditious and heterodox books either exposed to sale or secreted in private houses to investigate and examine concealments contempts conspiracies and calumnies against the government They were ordered to detect those persons who refused to preach the sacrament of the altar to hear mass to take holy bread or holy water to frequent their respective public churches and to assist in the solemn processions They were likewise privileged to summon what witnesses they judged most proper and to tender oaths to the parties prosecuted for answering such questions as might be deemed most convenient for discovering the truth In this injunction however there is a remarkable clause of restraint upon the commissioners For it is expressly commanded that if any person brought before them for heretical doctrines or opinions should still obstinately persist in his error  "He should immediately be committed to his ordinary there to be used according to the spiritual and ecclesiastical laws"  Bishop Burnet whose imagination was perpetually haunted with the horrors of popery supposes that something more dreadful was intended by this commission than appears at first sight and that it was undoubtedly designed  as the tribunal of an Inquisition in England  Hist Ref ii  But a superficial reader may plainly perceive that there is nothing of the form process or power of an Inquisition contained in this instrument The commissioners receive no authority to try heterodoxy nor to put the offenders upon  making an act of faith  On the contrary they are directed to deliver up all delinquents to the ordinary And even here the process is to be regulated by the laws of the church These circumstances seem sufficiently to exclude the idea of an inquisitorial tribunal For the proceedings of the commissioners however rigorously they might have been conducted were not unlimited and arbitrary but finally determinable by the proper ecclesiastical officer who was himself controlled by the spiritual constitutions of the land which did not at least on this occasion receive any degree of extension The zealous bishop makes the matter still more alarming where he tells us that in support of such measures  "he finds it said that some advised that courts of inquisition like those in France and Spain might be set up in England  Ubi supr p  "  But he does not inform us by whom this is said nor can I find this advice  in any of our historians Even Fox who omits nothing that can expose the papists who has studiously recorded all the idle reports of the times and who supposed that the papists worshipped one god and the protestants another  He thus rallies the devotion of the people for praying for Mary's happy delivery of a child  "Cry up louder you priests peradventure YOUR GOD IS ASLEEP  Vol iii p  is silent on this important subject And indeed if we consider the queen's late expostulation with the pope in which she declared her resolution of maintaining the prerogative and the constitution  When the Pope would have obtruded a new legate in the place of cardinal Pole and while he was actually on his journey to England the queen absolutely refused his admission into the kingdom Collier Eccl Hist ii  if we recollect that Philip's confessor Alphonsus expressly declaimed against persecutions in the pulpit by the king's own desire  Neal's Hist Pur i Strype Eccl Mem iii Heylin p Burnet Ref ii  and if to these reasons we add the distinguished lenity moderation and candor of cardinal Pope this project of an English inquisition must appear altogether improbable  But whatever was the real state of the case we find that the commissioners sensible that persecution naturally counteracts its own purpose  and averse to measures which might probably end in the most inhuman punishments did little or nothing in this business  Heylin ubi supr  especially as to the detection of prohibited books For so inactive were they that on the sixth of June the queen was obliged to publish a proclamation  Heylin ubi supr Strype Eccl Mem iii  in which she complains that not only numberless seditious and treasonable treatises were printed at home and dispersed without controul but even imported from abroad As the provocation was great so the proclamation is conceived in the most despotic and unconstitutional terms It sets forth amonst other extraordinary menaces that if those persons who find such unlawful books do not immediately destroy them they shall be reputed rebels and executed accordingly by martial law The queen indeed had some reason for complaint and for substituting somewhat more effectual in the place of her former commission by this recent injunction For during the actual subsistence and authority of that commission Knox and Goodman printed and imported from Geneva a piece entitled  The first Blast of the Trumpet against the monstrous Regimen of Women  Genev vo  In  this performance which is full of paradox and enthusiasm they call the queen  Traitress Bastard Proserpine  with other terms of illiberal and ridiculous abuse Goodman also published about the same time  How superior Powers ought to be obeyed of their Subjects and wherein they may be lawfully by God's Word disobeyed and resisted  Genev to printed by John Crispin Unluckily Mary herself while princess in yet certainly without any heretical intention had published a piece which of course fell under the censure of this commission It was a translation of Erasmus's paraphrase on St John and done by desire of queen Catharine Parr The preface is written by Udall master of Etonschool in which he much extolls and I believe not without reason Mary's proficience in literature  But these treatises written chiefly for the gratification of Calvin then living at Geneva were not more invectives against the invincible bigottries of Mary and the gross absurdities of popery than they were openly subversive of all established government and religion

counsellors and even dropped in the queen's own chamber  Amongst other pasquinades there were prints or pictures representing her majesty naked meager withered and wrinkled with every aggravated circumstance of deformity that could disgrace a female figure seated in a regal chair a crown on her head surrounded with M R and A in capital characters In the first of these was written in small letters  Maria  in the second  regina  and in the third  Anglioe  The additional figures were a great number of Spaniards sucking her Underneath in Italian characters were legends signifying that the Spaniards had sucked her to skin and bone as also specifying minutely the money rings jewels and other presents with which she had secretly gratified her husband Philip The queen was highly incensed at this insolent and popular piece of ridicule especially as she suspected some of her own council who alone were privy to these transactions and acquainted with her secrets  Carte iii    With regard to the persecutions of this reign which occasioned the commission in which Sir Thomas Pope was concerned relating to the suppression of heretics we will allow that the queen and her friends had suffered what they thought the most injurious treatment and no doubt when power returned into their hands were but too naturally disposed to retaliate in their own way These oppressions perhaps injudiciously conducted prepared the way for popery just as the severities of Mary at the succession of Elisabeth made the protestants more violent against the papists In the reign of Henry the eighth the monasteries were destroyed and the wealth of the church in which it's strength consisted was dissipated Three of the abbots in the course of that transaction were unjustly put to death  Collier Eccl Hist ii  Six bishops amongst which were Mary's favorites and the great champions of her religion Bonner and Gardiner were deprived insulted and imprisoned during the reign of Edward the sixth  See Heylin Eccles Rest sub ann  In the same reign the queen while princess was absolutely forbidden to hear mass a misfortune in her ideas almost equal  to the loss of life  See MSS Harl Brit Mus  "Mary had rather loss her life than part with the mass"  and her friends who privately interposed to defeat the execution of this dreadful interdiction were sent to the Tower  Strype Eccl Mem iii seq    But as no religion can expiate so no provocation can justify no resentment can excuse that uninterrupted series of deliberate barbarity which marks every page of her unprosperous annals with martyrdoms hardly to be paralleled in the pagan persecutions of primitive christianity If in the two preceding reigns many venerable prelates of Mary's communion had been injuriously treated or even put to death for conscientious disobedience yet none of them were inhumanly dragged to the flames like the meek Latimer or the learned Ridley It is also allowed that to burn heretics was an established doctrine of the catholic religion But in what age of the same religion or in what country were these punishments ever executed with so many circumstances of cruelty Her attempt to restore the monasteries however conformable to her system was a measure which tended only to bring back national poverty with national superstition for  it is certain that Henry's distribution of the monastic revenues into private hands although dictated by selfish and fordid motives founded the present greatness of England In the mean time it will be but charitable to grant that her private life was confessedly blameless and unblemished I will not say whether it was her fault or her unhappiness that the constancy of her attachments seldom met with suitable returns of gratitude and affection In this at least some goodness of heart appears that nothing affected her so much as the unkindness of those whom she best loved She possessed a firmness of mind which deserved better times and a vigour of understanding which was impeded by religious prejudices Her merits whatever they were seem to have been overlooked in her misfortunes and as the latter were aggravated so the former were obliterated by that blaze of prosperity which surrounded the succeeding reign  SECT III  IN the year the princess Elizabeth afterwards queen having been before treated with much insolence and inhumanity was placed under the care and inspection of sir Thomas Pope  Fox edit iii Speed c  Mary cherished that antipathy to the certain heiress of her crown and her successor which all princes who have no children to succeed naturally feel But the most powerful cause of Mary's hatred of the princess with whom she formerly lived in some degree of friendship  Strype Eccl Mem iii At queen Mary's

himself to the princess whose youth and lively conversation had more prevailing charms than the pomp and power of her sister  Burnet Ref ii Collier Eccl Hist ii  This preference not only produced a total change in Mary's sentiments which regard to the earl but forced her openly to declare war against Elizabeth  The ancient quarrel between their mothers remained deeply rooted in the malignant heart of the queen  Camden Eliz per Hearne i  Apparatus  pag  and she took advantage from the declaration made by parliament in favor of Catharine's marriage  Statut Mar i cap i  to represent her sister's birth as illegitimate Elizabeth's inclination to the protestant religion still further heightened Mary's aversion it offended her bigottry disappointed her exspectations  and disconcerted her politics These causes of dislike however might perhaps have been forgotten by degrees or at least would have ended in secret disgust But when the queen found that the princess had obstructed her designs in a matter of the most interesting nature female resentment founded on female jealousy and exasperated by pride could no longer be suppressed  So much more forcible and of so much more consequence in public affairs are private feelings and the secret undiscerned operations of the heart than the most important political reasons Monsieur Noailles however the French embassador at the court of England during this period with the true dignity of a mysterious statesman seems unwilling to refer the queen's displeasure to so slight a motive and assigns a more profound intrigue as the foundation of Courtenay's disgrace Domestic incidents operate alike in every station of life and often form the greatest events of history Princes have their passions in common with the rest of mankind  Elizabeth being now become the public and avowed object of Mary's aversion was openly treated with much disrespect and insult She was forbidden to take place in the  presence chamber of the countess of Lenox and the dutchess of Suffolk as if her legitimacy had been dubious  Goodwyn  This doctrine had been insinuated by the chancellor Gardiner in a speech before both houses of parliament  Sess sec ann prim Mar  Among other arguments enforcing the necessity of Mary's marriage he particularly insisted on the failure of the royal lineage artfully remarking that none of Henry's descendants

day drew the attention of the young nobility and rendered her universally popular the malevolence of the vindictive queen still encreased The princess therefore thought it most prudent to leave the court and before the begining of retired to her house at Ashridge in Hertfordshire  "Wherein our most worthie and ever famous queen Elisabeth lodged as in her owne beinge then a more stately house at the time of Wyatt's attempte in queen Maryes daye"  Norden's  Discription of Hartfordshire  written pag edit    In the mean time Sir Thomas Wyat's rebellion abovementioned broke out in opposition  to the queen's match with Philip of Spain It was immediately pretended that the princess Elisabeth together with lord Courteney was privately concerned in this dangerous conspiracy and that she had held a correspondence with the traitor Wyat Accordingly  See Hollingshed's Chron iii seq From Fox  sir Edward Hastings afterwards lord Loughborough sir Thomas Cornwallis and sir Richard Southwell attended by a troop of horse were ordered to bring her to the court They found the princess sick and even confined to her bed at Ashridge  Amb de Noailles whose papers are cited by Carte calls this a  favorable illness  "Since he adds it seems likely to save Mary from the crime of putting her sister to death by violence"  Carte iii  Notwithstanding under pretence of the strictness of their commission they compelled her to rise and still continuing very weak and indisposed she proceeded in the queen's litter by slow journies to London  Her manner of coming to London is thus described in a manuscript chronicle often cited hereafter  "The same tyme and daye between four and fyve of the cloke at night my lady Elisabeth's grace came to London through Smithfielde untoo Westminster with c velvet cotts after her grace And her grace rod in a charytt opyn on both sydes and her grace had ryding after her a in cotts of fyne redde gardyd with velvett and so through fletstrete unto the court

predominant disposition to cabal and intrigue with nineteen others of the council attended to examine her concerning the rebellion of which she was accused She positively denied the accusation However they informed her it was the queen's resolution the should be committed to the Tower till further enquiries could be made  Hollingshead ut supr  The princess immediately wrote to the queen earnestly entreating that she might not be imprisoned in the Tower and concluding her letter thus  "As for that Traytor Wiat he might paraventur write me a letter but on my faith I never receved any from him And as for the copie of my letter sent to the Frenche king I pray  God confound me eternally  if ever I sent him word message token or letter by any menes  Camden's Eliz per Hearne vol i editor praefat p  "  Her oaths and her repeated protestations of innocence were all ineffectual She was conveyed to the tower and ignominiously conducted through the Traitor's gate  May As MSS Cott Vitell F    At her first commitment only three men and three women of the queen's servants were  appointed for her attendants But even these were forbidden to bring her meat and she was waited on for this purpose by the lieutenant's servants or even by the common soldiers But afterwards two yeomen of her chamber one of her robes two of her pantry and ewry one of her buttery one of her cellar another of her larder and two of her kitchen were allowed by permission of the privy council to serve at her table No stranger or visitor was admitted into her presence The constable of the tower sir John Gage treated her very severely and watched her with the utmost vigilance Many of the other prisoners committed to the same place on account of the rebellion were often examined about her concern in the conspiracy and some of them were put to the rack by way of extorting an accusation Her innocence however was unquestionable for although Wyat himself had accused her in hopes to have saved his own life by means of so base and scandalous an artifice yet he afterwards denied that she had the least knowledge of his designs and lest those denials which he made at his examinations might be insidiously suppressed and his former depositions alledged against her adopted in their stead he continued to make the same declarations  openly on the scaffold at the time of his execution  Hollingshead ut supr    There was a pretence much insisted on by Gardiner that Wyat had conveyed to her a bracelet in which the whole scheme of the plot was inclosed But Wyat acquitted her of this and all other suspicions  Strype Eccl Mem iii  After a close imprisonment of some days by the generous intercession of lord Chandois lieutenant of the tower it was granted that she might sometimes walk in the queen's lodgings  Concerning these apartments in the Tower see the very judicious and ingenious Mr Walpole's  Historic Doubts concerning Richard the Third  in the presence of the constable the lieutenant and three of the queen's ladies yet on condition that the windows should be shut She then was indulged with walking in a little garden for the sake of fresh air but all the shutters which looked towards the garden were ordered to be kept close  Such were their jealousies that a little boy of four years old who had been accustomed every day to bring her flowers was severely threatened if he came any more and the child's father was summoned and rebuked by  the constable But lord Chandois being observed to treat the princess with too much respect he was not any longer entrusted with the charge of her and she was committed to the custody of sir Henry Bedingfield of Oxburgh in Norfolk  He was firmly attached to the queen's interests Beside his Government of the Tower he was knight marshal of the queen's army captain of her guards vicechamberlain to the queen and a privy counsellor She also granted him a yearly pention of l for life and part of the forseited estate of sir Thomas

at the towerwharffe and so to Rychmond and from thens unto Wyndsor and so to Wodstoke"  The first night of her journey she lay at Richmond where being watched all night by the soldiers and all access of her own private attendants utterly prohibited she  began to be convinced that orders had been given to put her privately to death The next day she reached Windsor where she was lodged in the Dean's house near saint George's collegiate chapel She then passed to lord Williams's seat at Ricot in Oxfordshire where she lay and  "was verie princelie entertained both of knights and ladies"  But Bedingfield was highly disgusted at this gallant entertainment of his prisoner During their journey lord Williams and another gentleman playing at chess the princess accidentally came in and told them she must stay to see the game played out but this liberty Bedingfield would not permit  Hollingshead ut supr    Arriving at Woodstock she was lodged in the gatehouse of the palace in an apartment remaining complete within these fifty years with it's original arched roof of Irish oak curiously carved painted blue sprinkled with gold and to the last retaining it's name of  Queen Elizabeth's chamber  The old royal manor or palace at Woodstock was besieged in the grand rebellion and much damaged in the siege The furniture was afterwards sold and the buildings portioned out by Cromwell or his agents to three persons Two of them about pulled down their portions for the sake of the stone The third suffered his part to stand which consisted of the gatehouse in which the princess Elizabeth was imprisoned and some adjoining ruinous buildings After the rebellion lord Lovelace turned this gatehouse into a dwelling house and lived in it for many years As to its adjoining ruins persons now living remember standing a noble porch and some walls of the hall the walls and magnificent window of the chapel several turrets at proper dista ces and could trace out many of the apartments Sir John Vanbrugh while Blenheim palace was building had taste enough to lay out l in keeping up the ruins But afterwards lord treasurer Godolphin observed to Sarah dutchessdowager of Marlborough that a pile

the heroine of the British throne the favorite of her people and the terror of the world contrived to relieve the tedious hours of her pensive and solitary confinement She had however little opportunity for meditation or amusement She was closely guarded yet sometimes suffered to walk into the gardens of the palace In this situation says Hollingshead  "no marvell if  she hearing upon a time out of hir gardin at Woodstocke a certaine milkmaide singing pleasantlie wished herself to be a milkmaide as she was saying that her case was better and life merrier  This circumstance has given occasion to an elegant ballad by Shenstone  "  After being confined here for many months she procured a permission to write to the queen but her importunate keeper Bedingfield intruded and overlooked what she wrote  Hollingshead ut supr  At length king Philip interposed and begged that she might be removed to the court  When she came to the crown says Hollingshead she discharged Bedingsield from the court telling him that whenever she should happen to have a stateprisoner who required to be  "hardlie handled and strictlie kept"  she would send for him Hollingshead p col But there is some reason to suspect that Fox from whom Hollingshead transcribes has aggravated in his account sir Henry's usage of the princess After she was queen he was very often at court and her majesty visited him in a progress And though she frequently called him her  Jaylor  yet this seems rather to have been a term of royal familiarity than of contempt Though I doubt not that he treated the princess with no great compassion or delicacy a circumstance which reslects honor on her forgiveness See Blomesield's Norfolk iii  But this sudden kindness of Philip who thought Elisabeth a much less obnoxious character than his father Charles the fifth had conceived her  to have been did not arise from any regular principle of real generosity but partly from an affectation of popularity  He affected to treat the princess with much respect In an examination cited by Hollingshead it appears that accidenttally passing her in a chamber of the palace he paid her such obeisance as to fall with one knee to the ground notwithstanding his usual state and solemnity Chron iii col  and partly from a refined sentiment of policy which made him foresee that if Elisabeth was put to death the next lawful heir would be Mary queen of Scots already betrothed to the dauphin of France whose succession would for ever join the sceptres of England and France and consequently crush the growing interests of Spain

and the attire of her head were twice or thrice blown off On this she begged to retire to a gentleman's house then at hand but Bedingfield's absurd and superabundant circumspection refused even this insignificant request and constrained her with much indecorum  to replace her headdress under a hedge near the road The next night they came to Mr Dormer's at Winge in Buckinghamshire and from thence to an inn at Colnebroke where she lay At length she arrived at Hamptoncourt where the court then resided but was still kept in the condition of a prisoner Here bishop Gardiner with others of the council frequently persuaded her to make a confession and submit to the queen's mercy Dissimulation appears to have been a conspicuous feature in Elisabeth's character One night when it was late the princess was unexpectedly summoned and conducted by torch light to the queen's bedchamber where she kneeled down before the queen declaring herself to be a most faithful and true subject She even went so far as to request the queen to send her some catholic treatises which might confirm her faith and inculcate doctrines different from those which she had been taught in the writings of the reformers

she presented her with a ring worth seven hundred crowns  Catte iii    But before I proceed further in this part of my narrative I stop to mention a circumstance unnoticed by our historians which is that sir Thomas Pope in conjunction with others had some concern about the person of the princess Elizabeth even when she first retired from the court in disgrace to her house at Ashridge and before her troubles commenced occasioned by Wyat's rebellion all which I have already related at large When that rebellion broke out Mary wrote to the princess then sick at Ashridge artfully requesting her immediate attendance at the court Elizabeth's governors at this time whose names are no where particularly mentioned waiting every day for her recovery  very compassionately declared it unsafe yet to remove her And the princess herself in the mean time signified by letter her indisposition to the queen begging that her journey to the court might be deferred for a few days and protesting her abhorrence of Wyat's seditious practices Her governors likewise on their parts apprehending that this tenderness towards their mistress might be interpreted in a bad sense dispatched a letter to bishop Gardiner lord chancellor acquainting him with her condition and avowing their readiness to receive the queen's commands An original draught or copy of this letter in Sir Thomas Pope's own hand

princess Elisabeth's domestics or attendants was John Astley one of Roger Ascham's literary friends and to whom many of his Latin letters are written Prefixed to Ascham's very sensible English political tract on the AFFAIRES OF GERMANIE and addressed to Astley is an English letter dated from Astley to Ascham in which the latter speaks feelingly of their frequent agreeable conversations on learned subjects at Hatfieldhouse Ascham was preceptor to the princess Sir Thomas Pope in a fragment of a letter to the president of Trinitycollege Oxford and dated Hatfield says that he had procured an Office in the Tower of London for  Maister Asteley  Probably this is the same person Ascham in some of his Epistles complains that he was unjustly driven from his tuition of Elisabeth in a consequence of a party formed against him in the family of the princess My principal reason for mentioning these particulars is to shew that sir Thomas Pope could not have been one of Ascham's enemies on this occasion for had that been the case it is not very probable that he should promote Ascham's friend He was husband of Catharine Asteley the governess of the princess See below p Ascham mentions this Catharine Asteley in very respectable terms in a Letter to the princess on the death of her tutor Grindall  "Hunc dolorem magis apud te renovando augere quam consolando lenīre vererer nisi

queen Elisabeth's accession with a salary of fifty pounds Decembr LIT PAT i Eliz He wrote a treatise on HORSEMANSHIP printed without his name in to By the way it appears from what has been said that the princess before her final settlement at Hatfield under sir Thomas Pope's care was occasionally shifted about to various royal seats of which Hatfield was one  from which circumstance it is manifest that he was at this time one of these  governors or attendants but in what department or capacity I know not However it  is evident that he was removed from this charge when the princess notwithstanding her infirm state of health was hurried up to the court by Southwell Cornwallis and Hastings nor do we find that from that time he had the least concern with her during her imprisonment in the tower and at Woodstock and the rest of those undeserved persecutions which preceded her enlargement and final removal to Hatfield  To this lady sir Thomas Pope behaved with the utmost tenderness and respect residing with her at Hatfield rather as an indulgent and affectionate guardian than as an officious or rigorous governor Although strict orders were given that the mass alone should be used in he family yet he connived  at many protestant servants whom she retained about her person  British View of the State of the church of England c Written in the year Lond mo p He adds that when his mother was dismissed her own father durst not take her into his house p  Yet Sir John Harrington says that his father a protestant was imprisoned in the tower for twelve months and fined one thousand pounds for carrying a letter to the princess and expressing his good wishes for her prosperity and that as if the heresy of a maid of honor could do any great harm his mother who was one of her favorite attendants was removed from that situation as a professed heretic by the command of bishop Gardiner  Strype Eccl Mem iii    Nor was sir Thomas Pope wanting on proper occasions in studiously shewing her such marks of regard and deference as her station and quality demanded This appears from the following anecdote which also marks his character  See Append Numb XV    Two of the fellows of Trinity college in Oxford just founded by him had violated one of it's strictest statutes and were accordingly expelled by the president and Society Upon  this they repaired to their founder then at Hatfield with the princess Elisabeth humbly petitioning a readmittance into his college Sir Thomas Pope probably was not a little perplexed on this occasion for although disposed to forgiveness yet he was unwilling to be the first who should openly countenance or pardon an infringement of laws which himself had made But perceiving a happy opportunity of adjusting the difficulty by paying at the same time a handsome compliment to the princess with much address he referred the matter to her gracious arbitration and she was pleased to order that they should immediately be restored to their fellowships In consequence of this determination he wrote the following letter to the President of the college  Maister President with my hertie commendations  Albeit Sympson and

Nor did sir Thomas Pope think it inconsistent with his trust to gratify the princess on some occasions with the fashionable amusements of the times even at his own expence and at the hazard of offending the queen This we learn from a passage in a curious manuscript chronicle  MSS Cotton fol Vitellius F Brit Mus MSS Strype See Append Numb XXVIII    "In Shrovetide sir Thomas Pope made for the

plates all at the chardgis of sir Thomas Pope And the next day the play of HOLOPHERNES But the queen percase mysliked these folliries as by her letters to sir Thomas Pope hit did appear and so their disguisinges were ceased"  The princess was notwithstanding sometimes suffered to make excursions partly for pleasure and partly for paying her compliments at court and on these occasions she was attended in a manner suitable to her rank Strype tells us from the same manuscript journal of memorable occurrences written  about those times  Strype Eccl Mem iii  that on February the twentyfifth  "The lady Elizabeth came riding from her house at Hatfield to London attended with a great companie of lords and nobles and gentlemen unto her place called Somersetplace beyond Strondbridge to do her duty to the queen And on the twentyeighth she repaired unto her grace at Whitehall with many lords and ladies"  And again in March the same year  "Aforenoon the lady Elizabeth's grace took her horse and rode to her palace of Shene with many lords knights ladies and gentlemen and a goodly companie of horse  Strype Eccl Mem iii  "  In April the same year she was escorted from Hatfield to Enfieldchase by a retinue of twelve ladies clothed in white sattin on  ambling palfries  and twenty yeomen in green all on horse back that  her grace  might  hunt the hart  At entering the chase or forest she was met by fifty archers in scarlet boots and yellow caps armed with gilded bows one of whom presented her a silverheaded arrow winged with peacock's feathers Sir Thomas Pope had the  devising  of this show By way of closing the sport or rather the ceremony the princess was gratified  with the privilege of cutting the throat of a buck  Vitell F MSS Cotton MSS Strype ut supr  In the same month she was visited by the queen at Hatfield when the great chamber was adorned with a sumptuous suit of tapestry called the  Hanginge of the siege of Antioch  and after supper a play was performed by the choirboys of Saint Paul's  MSS Ibid See HIST ENG POETRY ii    In the summer of the same year the princess paid a visit to the queen at Richmond She went by water from Somersetplace in the queen's barge which was richly hung with garlands of artificial flowers and covered with a of canopy green sarcenet wrought with branches of eglantine in embroidery and powdered with blossoms of gold In the barge she was accompanied by sir Thomas Pope and four ladies of her chamber Six boats attended on this procession filled with her highness's retinue habited in russet damaske and blue embroidered sattin tasselled and spangled with silver with bonnets of cloth of silver plumed with green feathers She was received by the queen in a sumptuous pavilion made in form of a castle with cloth of gold and purple velvet in the labyrinth of the gardens The walls or  sides of the pavilion were chequered into compartments in each of which was alternately a lily in silver and a pomegranate in gold Here they were entertained at a royal banquet in which was introduced a  sottletie  A curious devise in cookery or confectionary  of a pomegranatetree bearing the arms of Spain There were many

and king Philip at Hamptoncourt On Christmaseve the great hall of the palace was illuminated with a thousand lamps curiously disposed The princess supped at the same table in the hall with the king and queen next the cloth of state and after supper and served with a perfumed napkin and plates of confects by the lord Paget But she retired to her ladies before the revels masking and disguisings began On saint Stephen's day she heard mattins in the queen's closet adjoining to the chapel where she was  attired in a robe of white sattin strung all over with large pearls On the twenty ninth day of December she sate with their majesties and the nobility at a grand spectacle of justing when two hundred spears were broken Half of the combatants were accoutred in the Almaine and half in the Spanish fashion  Vitell F Cotton MSS Strype ut supr  Thus our chronicler who is fond of minute description But these and other particularities insignificant as they seem which he has recorded so carefully are a vindication of Queen Mary's character in the treatment of her sister they prove that the princess during her residence at Hatfield lived in splendor and affluence that she was often admitted to the diversions of the court and that her present situation was by no means a state of oppression and imprisonment as it has been represented by most of our historians  We have before seen that sir Thomas Pope during his attendance on this lady was engaged in the foundation of his college An undertaking of such a nature could not fail of attracting the attention of the young Elisabeth whose learned education and present situation naturally interested her in the progress of a work so beneficial to the increase  of her favorite pursuits and carried on by one with whom she was so nearly connected Accordingly this subject was often matter of conversation between them as appears from part of a letter written by sir Thomas Pope which also still further proves the friendly terms on which they lived together  "The princess Elisabeth her grace whom I serve here often askyth me about the course I have devysed for my scollers and that part of myne estatutes respectinge studie I have shewn to her which she likes well She is not only gracious but most lerned as ye right well know  Dat Hatfield To the President Ex Autograph ubi supr Ascham in one of his Latin Epistles gives the following interesting account of Elisabeth's progress in literature when she was very young under the year Among the learned daughters of Sir Thomas More he says the princess Elisabeth saines like a star of distinguished lustre deriving greater glory from her virtuous disposition and literary accomplishments than from the dignity of her exalted birth I was her preceptor in Latin and Greek for two years She was but little more than sixteen when she could speak French and Italian with as much fluency and propriety as her native English She speaks Latin readily justly and even critically She has often conversed with me in Greek and with tolerable facility When she transcribes Greek or Latin nothing can be more beautiful than her handwriting She is excellently skilled in music although not very fond of it She has read with me all Cicero and great part of Livy It is chiefly from those two authors alone that she has acquired her knowledge of the Latin langnage She begins the day with reading a portion of the Greek testament and then studies some select Orations of Isocrates and the tragedies of Sophocles From these authors I was of opinion that she would adorn her style with the most elegant diction enrich her mind with the most suitable precepts and frame her high station of life to every fortune For her religious instruction after the Scriptures she adds to the classics Saint Cyprian and the Common Places of Melancthon with other writers of that school who teach purity of doctrine with elegance of expression In every composition she is very quick in pointing out a farfetched word or affected phrase She cannot endure those absurd imitators of Erasmus who mince the whole latin Language into proverbial maxims She is much pleased with a Latin Oration naturally arising from its subject and written both chastly and perspicuously She is most fond of translations not too free and with that agreeable clash of sentiment which results from a judicious comparison of opposite or contradictory passages By a diligent attention to these things her taste is become so refined and her judgment so penetrating that there is nothing in Greek Latin and English composition either extravagant or exact carless or correct which she does not in the course of reading accurately discern immediately rejecting the one with disgust and receiving the other with the highest degree of pleasure Ascham EPISTOL Lib i p a edit Lond  "  While sir Thomas Pope was concerned in this superintendance of the princess he received a letter from Heath archbishop of York and lord chancellor the bishops of Rochester and Ely lord Arundel and sir Henry Jernegan dated July the thirtieth by which it appears that the privy council placed much confidence in his penetration and address and greatly depended on  his skilful management of her highness at this critical period  In consequence of Wyat's unsuccessfull attempt new efforts were made to foment a second insurrection Many of Wyat's adherents of which the principal was one Dudley Ashton had fled into France where they were well entertained Ashton being connected with both kingdoms sent over from France one Cleyberye a condemned person who pretended to be the earl of Devonshire The conspirators at the same time in the letters and proclamations which they dispersed made use of the lady Elisabeth's name and propagated many scandalous insinuations against her reputation and honour  Strype Eccl mem iii  They proceeded so far as at Ipswich to proclaim lord Courteney and the princess king and queen of England  Carte iii  In how licentious a manner her character was abused appears from a curious manuscript paper preserved in the British Museum entitled  "A relation how one Cleber proclaimed the ladie Elisabethe quene and her beloved bedfellow lord Edwarde Courtneye kynge  MSS Harl  "  It was thought proper  that the truth of this affair should be made known to the princess and as the communication of it was a matter of some delicacy and that misrepresentations might be prevented the council abovementioned order sir Thomas Pope  "Because this matter is spread abroad and that paradventure many constructions and discourses will be made thereof we have thought meet to signifie the whole circumstances of the case unto you to be by you opened to the ladie Elisabeth's grace at such time as ye shall thinke most convenient To the end it may appear unto her how little these men stick by falshood and untruthe to compass their purpose not letting for that intent to abuse the

queen herself wrote a letter to  the princess in which she expressed her abhorrence and disbelief of these infamous forgeries It was answered by the princess who declared her detestation of the conspirators and disclaimed the least knowledge of their malicious designs Undoubtedly having suffered so severely and perhaps unjustly in the affair of Wyat she judged it expedient to clear her character even from the most improbable suspicions Commissioners were immediately appointed for examining into this conspiracy sir Francis Englefield the comptroller sir Edward Waldegrave sir Henry Jernegan sir Edward Hastings and Cordall the queen's sollicitor and several of the parties were apprehended and condemned at Guildhall  Strype Eccl Mem iii  When war was next year proclaimed against France this secret concurrence of the French court with the machinations of Dudley Ashton and his accomplices was expressly specified amongst other articles in the declaration  Camden Eliz per Hearne i  Apparat  pag    Soon afterwards Eric king of Sweden sent by his ambassador a message secretly to the princess at Hatfield with a proposal of marriage King Philip had just before proposed  to the queen to marry her to the duke of Savoy  Strype Eccl Mem iii  with a view perhaps of retaining the duke who was an able general in his interests against France with which Philip was at this time engaged in open hostilities This proposal of the king of Sweden she wisely rejected because it was not conveyed to her by the queen's directions But to this objection the embassador answered that the king of Sweden his master as a man of honor and a gentleman thought it most proper to make the first application to herself and that having by this preparatory step obtained her consent he would next as a king mention the affair in form to her majesty But the final answer of princess was an absolute denial and she desired the messenger to acquaint his master that as she could not listen to any proposals of that nature unless made by the queen's advice or authority so she could not but declare that if left to her own will she would always prefer a single condition of life The affair soon came to the queen's ears who sending for sir Thomas Pope to court received from him an entire account of this secret transaction ordering sir Thomas at the same time to write to the princess and acquaint her  how much she was satisfied with this prudent and dutiful answer to the king of Sweden's proposition Sir Thomas Pope very soon afterwards returned to his charge at Hatfield when the queen commanded him not only to repeat this approbation of the conduct of the princess relating to the proposed match from Sweden but to receive from her own mouth the result of her sentiments concerning it and at the same time to take an opportunity of sounding her affections concerning the duke of Savoy without mentioning his name The imperial ambassadors Mountmorency lord of Courieres and Bouchard were still in England waiting for the event of the latter negociation  Carte iii  For the Emperor Charles the fifth  See Hume Hist iii seq Ed to And Dr Robertson's masterly History of Charles the fifth  who was now become her friend and had before interested himself in her favor was anxious by such an important connection to form a potent and lasting alliance between the British and Imperial crowns But I shall insert sir Thomas Pope's letter written in consequence of this commission to the queen or council by which he seems perfectly to have understood Elisabeth's real thoughts and disposition  First after I had declared to her grace how well the quene's majestie liked of her prudent and honorable answere made to the same messenger I then opened unto her grace the effects of the sayd messengers credence which after her grace had hard I sayd the queenes highnes had sent me to her grace not onlie to declare the same but also to understande how her grace liked the sayd motion

that time as appears from many curious anecdotes of her early coquetry with lord Thomas Seymour high admiral who married Catharine Parr widow of Henry viii Burghley's State Papers vol i by Haynes p  "

to propose to her in person a marriage with Philibert Emanuel the duke of Savoy which sir Thomas Pope by the queen's commands had before hinted at a distance as we have seen in the preceding letter This proposal the princess declined but disguised her refusal with the same earnest professions of her unchangeable devotion to a state of virginity which she had before made to sir Thomas Pope on account of the Swedish match Great court was paid to the princess during her abode at Somersethouse  Carte iii  Her amiable condescension obliging address and agreeable conversation procured her new interests and attachments and even engaged the best part of the lords of the council in her favor  Her beauty perhaps had no great share in these acquisitions such as it was it still retained some

inclinations and although she had been invited to pass the whole winter in London after a short stay of one week only she returned to her former situation at Hatfield  "Hir grace did loge at hir plase

a match recommended by Philip and so convenient to his purposes But it appears that the queen was extremely backward in promoting her husband's desire of marrying Elisabeth to the duke of Savoy On this account Philip employed Alphonsus a franciscan frier his confessor to confer with her majesty on the subject of this marriage She told him that she feared without consent of parliament neither her husband Philip nor the nation would be benefited by this alliance She added that she could not in point of conscience press this match upon her sister  meaning perhaps that it would be unjust to force the princess to be married after her resolute declarations against wedlock or improper and dishonorable to match her beneath the dignity of a crowned head The theological reasonings of Alphonsus were too refined for the understanding or too weak for the conscience of the queen who still remained inflexible in her former opinion Upon this Philip wrote to her in his usual authoritative style advising her to examine her own conscience and to consider whether her opinion was founded in truth or in obstinacy adding that if the parliament opposed his request he should lay the blame upon her  Strype Eccl Mem iii seq  The queen in her answer begged that he would at least defer the matter till he returned into England and that then he might have a better opportunity of judging what attention her reasons deserved That otherwise she should live in jealousy of his affections a state of mind to her worse than death but which to her great disquietude she had already began to feel She observed with many expressions of deference to his superior judgment and authority that whatever her conscience might have determined the matter could not be  possibly brought to any speedy conclusion as the duke would be immediately ordered into the field  This letter which is in French and printed by Strype  Strype Eccl Mem iii Append Numb LVI  is no less a specimen of her implicit submission to Philip than the whole transaction is at the same time an instance of that unconquerable perseverance which the queen exerted on certain occasions Philip persisted in his design and with a view to accomplish it more effectually dispatched into England the duchess of Parma and the duchess of Lorraine whom he commissioned to bring back with them the princess Elisabeth into Flanders Philip was in love with the duchess of Lorain and the splendor of her table and retinue which she was unable to support of herself made the queen extremely jealous She was therefore whatever her companion might have been a very improper suitress on this occasion The queen would not permit the two duchesses to visit the princess at Hatfield and every moment of their stay gave her infinite uneasiness But they both soon returned without success  Carte iii    Perhaps the growing jealousy of the queen a passion which often ends in revenge against the beloved object might at least have some share in dictating this opposition to Philip  Philip while abroad had shewn her so many marks of indifference and had trifled with her so frequently about his return to England that once in a fit of rage she tore his picture Carte ibid  At length the remonstrances of the queen and the repeated disapprobation of the princess prevailed and it is certain whatever Mary's real motives might be that the proposal was suddenly laid aside But Mary so far concurred with Philip's measures as the next year to declare war against France  Yet the public finances were at this time so low that she could not procure a single vote from her privycouncil for the declaration of war and she therefore threatened to dismiss them all from the board and to appoint counsellors more obsequious Hume iii ed to  in which the duke of Savoy

of London had published prints of her majesty Elisabeth and the king of Sweden in one piece This liberty as it was called gave great offence to the queen who ordered secretary Cecil to write to the

reign which the princess Elisabeth passed at Hatfield with sir Thomas Pope were by far the most agreeable part of her time during that turbulent period For although she must have been often disquieted with many secret fears and apprehensions yet she was here perfectly at liberty and treated with a regard due to her birth and expectations In the mean time to prevent suspicions she prudently declined interfering in any sort of business and abandoned herself entirely to  books and amusements  Burnet Hist Ref ubi supr p  The pleasures of solitude and retirement were now become habitual to her mind

mentioned by which he secured immortality to his name and conferred a perpetual emolument on his country I mean the foundation of Trinity college in Oxford His good sense and good disposition led him to reflect that he could not bestow a competent proportion of those riches which he had so largely received with greater propriety utility and generosity than in the service of the public I shall therefore make no apology for delivering at large a history of his proceedings in forming and completing this liberal design  And perhaps there are some of my readers who will be more pleased to view him in the milder and more amiable light of the father of ingenuous education dispensing rewards to science and virtue than in the more active yet turbulent scenes of public life diversified only  by the vain vicissitudes of human affairs or fraught with the crimes and misfortunes of mankind  About the year Richard de Hoton prior and the monks of the cathedral convent of Durham erected a college in the northern suburbs of Oxford for the education of the novices of their monastery to which it was considered as an appendage  See grant in the Appendix Numb VI Which as it probably contains the first and early separation of the ground on which Trinity college now stands with its precincts or of the greatest part of these to the purposes of learning was thought too curious to be omitted among the original papers  This was afterwards increased with the addition of revenues and books by Richard of Bury bishop of Durham in the year It was at length entirely rebuilt more effectually established and more amply endowed for eight benedictine monks and eight secular students in the year by the munificence of Thomas Hatfield bishop of the same see  The monks were allowed annually ten pounds each and the seculars five mar  s It is remarkable that the stipend of these monks is treble to most of the fellowships then in Oxford  About the year this college was dissolved by Henry the eighth  See Stevens's Monast vol i p from MSS A Wood  at which time all its estates its site precinct chapel bellfry buildings of all sorts  with the entire appurtenances of the same were granted by the king to his new dean and chapter of Durham cathedral which as I presume they now possess  See Append Numb *VII*  Its site only reverted to the crown for Edward the sixth in the seventh year of his reign by letters patent dated February the fourth  See Append Numb VIII  granted the site of this college to George Owen of Godstowe the king's physician and William Martyn gentleman  On this ground sir Thomas Pope determined to found his intended college Accordingly by indenture dated February the twentieth  See Append Numb IX  he purchased the premises of the said Owen and Martyn In the same year he obtained from Philip and Mary a royal licence or charter dated March the eigthth  See Append Numb X  empowering him to create and erect a certain college within the university of Oxford consisting of one president a priest twelve fellows four of whom should be priests and eight scholars  This Number he afterwards encreased to  twelve  and liberally and sufficiently to endow the same and their successors with certain manors lands and revenues In the same  charter and with the estates and possessions therein recited he likewise obtains licence of the king and queen to found and endow a school at Hokenorton in the county of Oxford to be called  Jesus Scolehouse  and to give statutes as well to the college as to the first and second masters of the said school  "Ac eciam

rebuilding the public schools at Oxford  "gave encouragement to two worthy gentlemen to add two new colleges to the former Trinity and saint John's Had it not been for these Foundations there had been nothing in this reign to have made it memorable but only the misfortunes and calamities of it  Eccles Restaurat Hist of Q Mary p  "  He might have added that this liberality  could not have been conferred at a more seasonable time on the university And of this sir Thomas Pope was very sensible as we have before seen when he substituted an additional number of academical students in the place of a grammarschool  But that it may further appear how much these encouragements were now wanted it will be necessry to look backwards upon the state of learning in England particularly at Oxford and from thence to trace its progress and the causes of its decline down to the times with which we are concerned An enquiry not less instructive than entertaining and naturally connected with the present subject  About the close of the fifteenth century a taste for polite letters under the patronage of the popes began to be revived in Italy But these liberal pontiffs did not consider at the same time that they were undermining the papal interest and bringing on the Reformation This event is commonly called the Restoration of Learning but it should rather be styled the restoration of good sense and useful knowledge Learning there had been before but barbarism still remained The  most acute efforts of human wit and penetration had been exerted for some centuries in the dissertations of logicians and theologists yet Europe still remained in a state of superstition and ignorance What philosophy could not perform was reserved to be completed by classical literature by the poets and orators of Greece and Rome who alone could enlarge the mind and polish the manners Taste and propriety and a rectitude of thinking and judging derived from these sources gave a new turn to the general system of study mankind was civilized and religion was reformed The effects of this happy revolution by degrees reached England  We find at Oxford in the latter end of the fifteenth century that the university was filled with the jargon and disputes of the Scotists and Thomists and if at that time there were any scholars of better note these were chiefly the followers of Wicliffe and were consequently discountenanced and persecuted The latin style then only known in the university was the technical language of the schoolmen of casuists and metaphysicians At Cambridge about nothing was taught but Alexander's  Parva Logicalia  the trite axioms of Aristotle which were never rationally explained and the profound  questions of John Scotus  Erasm Epist H Bovillo dat Roffae  At length some of our countrymen the principal of which were Grocyn Latymer Lillye Linacer Tunstall Pace and sir Thomas More ventured to break through the narrow bounds of scholastic erudition and went over into Italy with a design of acquiring a knowledge in the Greek and Latin languages  Leland ENCOM pag edit to viz  Omnes Italiam petierunt sydere fausto  Et nituit Latiis terra Britanna Scholis  The Greek in particular was taught there with much perfection and purity by many learned Greeks who had been driven from Constantinople In Grocyn and Linacer left Oxford and studied Greek at Florence under the instruction of Demetrius Chalcondylas and Politian and at Rome under Hermolaus Barbarus  Wood Ath Oxon i See Stapleton de tribus THOMIS cap i  Grocyn returned an accomplished master in the Greek and became the first lecturer of that language at Oxford but without any settled endowment  Wood Hist Antiq univ Oxon i  Elegance of style began now to be cultivated and the study of the most approved antient writers became fashionable  In Alcock bishop of Ely founded Jesus college in Cambridge partly for a certain number of scholars to be educated in grammar  See Lit Pat Hen vii quod Johannes Episcopus Eliens fundare possit quoddam collegium de uno magistro et sex sociis et certo numero scholarium in  Grammatica  erudiendorum Rymer Foed xii and Knight's Life of Colet p  Degrees in grammar or rhetoric had been early established at Oxford But the pupils of this class studied only systems of grammar and rhetoric filled with empty definitions and unnecessary distinctions instead of the real models  Walter de Merton in the statutes of Merton college at Oxford appoints a grammarian in that society  "Sit etiam in ipsa congregatione grammaticus unus qui studio grammaticae totaliter vacetEt eorum qui studio grammaticae fuerint applicati curam habeat et ad ipsum etiam provectiores in dubiis suae facultatis sine rubore habeant regressum c"  Statut coll Mert cap ii These statutes were given in August AD  In Lillye the famous grammarian who have learned Greek at Rhodes and afterwards improved himself in latin at Rome under Johanes Sulpitius and Pomponius Sabinus was the first teacher of greek at any public School in England This was at saint Paul's school in London then newly established and of which Lillye was the first Master  Knight's Life of Colet p  And that ancient prejudices  were subsiding apace and a national taste for critical studies and the graces of composition began to be diffused appears from this circumstance alone that from the year to the reformation within the space of thirty years there were more grammar schools founded and endowed in England than had been for three hundred years before  Knight ubi supr p  Near twenty grammar schools were instituted within this period before which most of your youth were educated at the monasteries  It is not to be doubted that William of Wykeham's ample foundation at Winchester formed on a plan perfectly original and that of Henry vi at Eton its transcript were very conducive although distant instruments in preparing and facilitating this great work And indeed long before the period at which we began William of Wainflete sensible of the expediency of grammar learning had founded two considerable schoolsJohn Leland or Leilont taught grammar in Peckwaterinn at Oxford of which he was principal about the reign of Henry vi He wrote a  Grammar  which I have seen in the black letter entitled GRAMMATICA NOVA Prefixed are some recommendatory epigrams  "  Carmeliani poctae  "  One of these is entitled  "  In reverendum dominum Gulielmum episcopun Wintoniensem  "  That is William of Waynflete It is closed with this distich  Hoc opus auctor enim  te persuadente  Joannes  Edidit c  Whence it appears that John Leland the author wrote this  Grammar  by the advice and encouragement of William of Waynflete probably while the latter was master of Winchester school as Leland died in the year    In that wise prelate and bountiful patron Richard Fox founded his college  Statut C C C Oxon dat Jun xx Cap xx fol Bibl Bodl MSS Laud I  at Oxford in which he constituted with competent salaries two lectures for the latin and greek languages  Beside a third in theology  This was a new and noble departure from the narrow plan of academical education  It is not however to be forgotten here that at the foundation of Christ's college in Cambridge a lecturer was established who together with logic and philosophy is ordered to read  "vel ex poetarum vel oratorum operibus"  Cap xxxvii These statutes were given in the year In the statutes of King's at Cambridge and New college at Oxford both much more antient an instructor is appointed by the general name of  Informater  only who taught all the learning then in vogue  The course of the latin lecturer was not confined to the college but open to the students of Oxford in general He is expressly directed to drive  barbarism  from the new college  "Lector seu professor artium humaniorum  barbariem  e nostro alveario extirpet"  And at the same time it is to be remarked that Fox does not appoint a philosophylecturer in his college as had been the practice in most of the previous foundations perhaps thinking that such an institution would not have coincided  with his new system of doctrine and that it would be encouraging that species of science which had hitherto blinded mens understandings and kept them so long in ignorance of more useful knowledge The greek lecturer is ordered to explain the best greek classics and those which the judicious founder who seems to have consulted the most capital scholars of his age prescribes on this occasion are the purest and such as are most esteemed at this day  These happy beginnings were seconded by the munificence of cardinal Wolsed About the year he founded a public chair at Oxford for rhetoric and humanity and soon afterwards another for the greek tongue endowing both with ample stipends  Wood Hist Antiq univ Oxon i  But these innovations in the plan of study were greatly discouraged and opposed by the scholastic bigots who called the greek language heresy Even bishop Fox when he founded the greek lecture abovementioned was obliged to cover his excellent institution under the venerable mantle of the authority of the church lest she should seem to countenance a dangerous novelty For he gives it as a reason or rather as an apology for this new  lectureship that the sacred canons had commanded that a knowledge of the greek tongue should not be wanting in public seminaries of education  "Quem praeterea in nostro alveario collocavimus quod sacrosancti canones commodissime pro bonis literis et imprimis christianis instituerunt ac jusserunt eum in hac universitate Oxon perinde ac paucis aliis celeberrimis gymnasiis nunquam desyderari Nec tamen eos  hac ratione  excusatos volumus qui Graecam lectionem in ea suis impensis sustentare bebent"  Statut C C C ut supr By these  sacri canones  he means a decree of the council of Vienne which enjoined that professors of Greek Hebrew and Arabic should be instituted in the universities of Oxford Paris Bononia Salamanca and the court of Rome Gregory Typhernas one of the learned greek fugitives about the year offered to teach greek in the university of Paris and asked a stipend for his labour under this canon Naud apud Hod de Graec illustr lib ii c pag See also Hod ibid pag  The university of Oxford was rent into factions on account of these attempts and the defenders of the new erudition from disputations often proceeded to blows with the rigid champions of the schools But these animosities were soon pacified by the persuasion and example of Erasmus who was about this time a student in saint Mary's college at Oxford opposite to NewInn  Wood Hist Antiq univ Oxon i  At Cambridge however which in imitation of Oxford had adopted greek Erasmus found greater difficulties He tells us himself that at Cambridge he read the  greek grammar of Chrysoloras to the bare walls  Epist cxxiii Ammonio dat tom iii p Opp  and that having translated Lucian's dialogue called Icaromenippus he could find no person in the university able to transcribe the greek with the latin  Epist cxxxix dat Ibid p  His edition of the greek testament was entirely proscribed there and a decree was issued in one of the most considerable colleges ordering that if any of the society was detected in bringing that impious and fantastic book into the college he should be severely fined  Epist cxlviii H Bovillo

free from these contracted notions In a preacher at saint Mary's church harangued with much violence against these pernicious teachers and his arguments occasioned no small ferment among the students  But Henry the eighth who was luckily a patron of these improvements being then resident at the neighbouring royal manor of Woodstock and having received a just state of the case from Pace and More immediately transmitted his royal mandate to the university ordering that these studies shoud not only be permitted but encouraged  Erasm epist ccclxxx ut inf  Soon afterwards one of the king's chaplains preaching at court took an opportunity to censure the new but genuine interpretations of scripture which the grecian learning had introduced The king when the sermon was ended which he heard with a smile of contempt ordered a solemn disputation to be held in the presence of himself at which the preacher opposed and sir Thomas More defended the use and excellence of the greek tongue The divine instead of answering to the purpose fell upon his knees and begged pardon for having given any offence in the pulpit After some little altercation the preacher by way of a decent submission declared that he was now better reconciled to the greek tongue because it was derived from the hebrew The king amazed at his ignorance dismissed him with a charge that he should never again presume to preach  at court  Erasm epist P Mosellano dat ccclxxx pag tom iii  In the grammarschools established in all the new cathedral foundations of this king a master was appointed with a competent skill not only in the latin but likewise in the greek language  "Statuimus praeterea ut per Decanum c unu    Ardididas  eligatur latine et  Gr  e  doctus bo  ae famae c"  Statut eccles cathedr Roffens cap xxv They were given Jun In the same statute the second master is required to be only  Latine  doctus It is remarkable that cardinal Wolsey does not order greek to be taught in his school at Ipswich founded See Strype's Eccl Mem i Append xxxv pag seq  This was an uncommon qualification in a schoolmaster  At length ancient absurdities universally gave way to these encouragements and at Oxford in particular these united efforts for establishing a new system of rational and manly learning were finally consummated in the magnificent foundation of Wolsey's college to which all the Learned of Europe were invited  But these auspicious improvements in the state of learning did not continue long A change of the national religion soon happened  and disputes with the Lutherans ensued which embroiling the minds of learned men in difference of opinion disunited their endeavours in the cause of literature and diverted their attention to other enquiries  Many of the abuses in civil society are attended with some advantages In the beginnings of reformation the loss of these advantages is always felt very sensibly while the benefit resulting from the change is the slow effect of time and not immediately percieved or enjoyed Scarce any institution can be imagined less favorable to the interests of mankind than the monastic Yet a great temporary check given to the progress of literature at this period was the dissolution of the monasteries For although these seminaries were in general the nurseries of illiterate indolence and undoubtedly deserved to be destroyed yet the still contained invitations and opportunities to studious leisure and literary pursuits On this important event therefore a visible revolution and decline in the state of learning succeeded Most of the youth of the kingdom betook themselves to mechanical or other illiberal employments the profession of letters being now supposed to be without support and reward  By the abolition of the religious houses many towns and their adjacent villages were utterly deprived of their only means of instruction What was taught in the monasteries was perhaps of no great importance but still it served to keep up a certain degree of necessary knowledge Hence provincial ignorance became almost universally established  Nor should we forget that several of the abbots were persons of public spirit by their connection with parliament they became acquainted with the world and knowing where and how to chuse proper objects and having no other use for the superfluity of their vast revenues encouraged in their respective circles many learned young men  It is generally thought that the reformation of religion the most happy and important event of modern times was immediately succeeded by a flourishing state of learning But this in England at least was by no means the case and for a long time afterwards an effect quite contrary was produced Yet in the king's visitors ordered lectures in humanity to be founded in those societies at Oxford where they were yet wanting and  these injunctions were so warmly seconded and approved by the scholars in the largest colleges that they seized on the venerable volumes of Duns Scotus and other irrefragable logicians and tearing them in pieces dispersed them in great triumph about their quadrangles or gave them away as useless lumber  See Dr Layton's Letter to Cromwell Strype's Eccl Mem i  The king himself also established some public lectures with large endowments  Wood Hist Antiq univ Oxon i col ii col  Notwithstanding the number of

at Cambridge under the instruction of Cheke and Smyth  Strype's Lives of Cheke and Smyth  notwithstanding the unreasonable interposition of their chancellor bishop Gardiner about pronunciation But Cheke being soon called up to court both universities seem to have been reduced  to the same deplorable condition of indigence and illiteracy  Roger Ascham acquaints us that about this time the

liberal donations the interests of learning She not only contributed  large sums for rebuilding the public schools but moreover granted the university three considerable impropriations In her charter

more important benefactors by their respective foundations Without all these favors although they did not perhaps produce an immediate improvement the university would still have continued to decay and they were at least a balance at that time on the side of learning against the pernicious effects of returning popery  In the beginning of the reign of Elisabeth which soon followed when protestantism might have been expected to produce a speedy change for the better puritanism began to prevail and for some time continued to retard the progress of ingenuous and useful knowledge The English reformed clergy who during the persecutions of queen Mary had fled into Germany now returned in great numbers' and in consideration of their sufferings and learning many of them were preferred to eminent stations in the church They brought back with them those narrow principles about churchgovernment and ceremonies which they had imbibed and which did well enough in the petty states and republics  abroad where they lived like a society of philosophers but which were inconsistent with the genius of a more extended church established in a great and magnificent nation and requiring a settled system of policy and the observance of external institutions However they were judged proper instruments to be employed at the head of ecclesiastical affairs by way of making the reformation at once effectual But unluckily this measure specious as it appeared at first tended to draw the church into the contrary extreme In the mean time their reluctance or absolute refusal to conform in many instances to the established ceremonies and their speculative theology tore the church into violent divisions and occasioned endless absurd disputes unfavorable to the progress of real learning and productive of an illiterate clergy at least unskilled in liberal and manly science  In fact even the common ecclesiastical preferments had been so much diminished by the seizure and alienation of impropriations in the late depredations of the church which were not yet ended that few persons were regularly bred to the church or in other words received a learned education Hence almost any that offered themselves  were without distinction admitted to the sacred function Insomuch that in an injunction was directed to the bishop of London from his metropolitan ordering him to forbear ordaining any more artificers and other unlearned persons who had exercised secular occupations  Strype's Life of Grindal b i ch pag  But as the evil was unavoidable this caution took but little effect About the year there were only two divines the dean of Christ Church and the president of Magdalene college who were capable of preaching the public sermons at Oxford  Wood ut supr i  Many proofs have been mentioned of the extreme ignorance of our clergy at this time to which I shall add one which is curious and new In Horne bishop of Winchester enjoined the Minor canons of his cathedral to get by memory every week one chapter of saint Paul's epistles in latin and this task beneath the abilities of an ordinary schoolboy was actually repeated by some of them before the bishop dean and prebendaries at a public episcopal visitation of that church  Registr Horne Episcop Winton sol b    The taste for latin composition and it was fashionable both to write and speak in that  language was much worse than in the reign of Henry the eighth when juster models were studied One is surprized to find the learned archbishop Grindal in the statutes of a school which he founded and amply endowed prescribing such strange classics as Palingenius Sedulius and Prudentius to be taught in the new seminary  Strype's Life of Grindal B ii ch pag This was AD  Much has been said about the passion for reading Greek which prevailed in this reign But this affectation was confined to the queen and a few others and here it went no farther than ostentation and pedantry It was by no means the national study nor do we find that it improved the taste or influenced the writings of that age But I am wandering beyond the bounds which I first prescribed to this necessary digression  Yet I must add an observation or two In government many shocks must happen before the constitution is perfected In like manner it was late in the reign of Elisabeth before learning after its sinews had been relaxed by frequent changes and commotions recovered its proper tone and rose with new vigor under the genial influence of the  protestant religion And it may be further remarked that as all novelties are pursued to excess and the most beneficial improvements often introduce new inconveniencies so this influx of polite literature destroyed philosophy On this account sir Henry Savile in the reign of James the first established professors at Oxford for astronomy and geometry because as he declares in the preamble of his statutes mathematical studies had been totally deserted and were then almost unknown in England  See Rym Foed xvii It is observable that he entirely interdicted the teaching of judicial astrology to his professor of Astronomy Statut Savil cap ii These statutes are dated Aug  Logic indeed remained but that science was still cultivated as being the basis of polemical theology and a necessary instrument for conducting our controversies against the church of Rome  SECT V  IN

his house to dinner  "being as my manuscript says a very great dinner and plenty of all thinges"  Then followed a great dole of almes distributed among the Poor  Stowe insinuates that he was interred in  the north ile of the choir of Wallbrook church Here was a vault in which before had been buried his wife Margaret his daughter Alice and Anne Pope his sister in law Stowe adds the following

dame Margaret aforesaid were removed from saint Stephen's Wallbrook to the chapel of Trinity college in Oxford where they were again interred on the north side of the altar under a stately tomb of good gothic workmanship on which are the recumbent figures of sir Thomas Pope in complete armour and of his second wife Elisabeth large as the life in alabaster with this inscription  Hic jacent

originally stood within a grate of iron  Arms c  by Lee ut inf f The greatest part of its elegant workmanship is now concealed and the effect of the whole destroyed by an alcove corresponding to another on the opposite side both which considered in a general view are most injudiciously introduced and are perhaps the only blemishes of the present beautiful chapel    That the body of the founder was actually removed hither appears unquestionably from the Will of Elizabeth his second wife who desires expressly to be buried in a vault or tomb in Trinity college chapel in Oxford  "wherein lieth the corps of my late good husband sir Thomas Pope  Infra citat  "  This is also further confirmed from the testimony of Anthony Wood who in the Appendix subjoined to his History of the University of Oxford containing omissions and mistakes of the translator in the Text of that elaborate work observes that notwithstanding the inscription in saint Stephen's Wallbrook his Translator according to the original English copy ought to have expressly inserted in the place  where sir Thomas Pope's burial is mentioned  "Sed sepultus fuit in capella coll SS Trinitatis  In Appendic Hist

no mention should be recorded of this Removal of the founder's body in any register of the college That this tomb in the college chapel was standing in the year at least that the founder was then removed thither may be fairly concluded from the two following entries in the computus of the Bursars of that year and they are the only notices that any where occur concerning it viz  "Sol  Mar

inaccurately represented the affecting story of his death  Artic APOLLONIUS TYANAEUS The true story is this Mr Blount on the death of his wife fell in love with her sister a lady of great beauty and accomplishments she was not insensible to his attachment but was scrupulous about the legality of marrying her sister's late husband On his application to the most learned civilians and the archbishop of Canterbury he was informed that such a match could not take place On this the lady positively refused her consent and Mr Blount in a fit of despair shot himself through the head The wound not immediately proving mortal he lived five days during which time he received no fustenance or medicines but from the hands of the lady who attended him with the most sympathetic tenderness till his last moments This account I received from the late sir Harry PopeBlount baronet the last of the family and a diligent and faithful antiquary    I close my account of Dame Elizabeth Powlett and her nearer relations with a few words concerning the antiquity and dignity of her family Its ancestor was Le Blound lord of Guisnes in Normany whose sons Robert and William le Blound both entered England with William the conqueror William was one of the captains in that expedition and quartered with other Norman knights on the monks of Ely Robert was created by the conqueror baron of Ixworth in Suffolk in which county he received a grant of thirteen lordships Gilbert his son founded an Augustine priory at Ixworth in the reign of William Rufus which he endowed with fourteen knights fees One of Gilbert's descendants was killed at the battle of Lewes  in the reign of Henry the third where he was standardbearer to Mountford earl of Leicester In the progress of it's descent this family numbers many persons of singular eminence and high station  See Peacham's COMPLEAT GENTLEMAN edit pag And Eng Baronet iv And ii  and is besides nobly connected by marriages On the sides of the tomb in Trinity college chapel abovementioned are two coats Pope impaling Quarterings of Blount viz Barry Nebule of six Or and sable And of Roger de Sutton ancestor of Elizabeth's mother viz A lyon rampant This is one coat The other consists of quarterings of Blount Of the said Roger de Sutton and Of Nicholas de Wichard lord of the manor of Osberston aforesaid in the reign of Henry the third marrying into the said Roger viz Azure a cheveron Argent between three martlets  See Burton's Leicestershire p  Or These arms are an additional and evident proof that Dame Elizabeth Powlett erected this monument in decorating which she was so studious to introduce the ensigns and honors of her own family  There is an old portrait of lady Powlett in the Bursary at Trinity college painted as I judge from the drapery and the age of the countenance about the middle of Q Elisabeth's reign by which she appears to have been handsome This picture was in the college at least before It is mentioned in Comp Burss coll I have been told that this picture was painted by sir Antonio More portrait and history painter to Philip and Mary Several of his pictures were in the collection of king Charles the first and at sir Philip Sydenham's at Brympton in Somersetshire a family as we have seen nearly related to Lady Powlett More had one hundred ducats for his common portraits He died in I rather think this picture is a copy of an original by More    SECT VII  IT may be necessary to speak of sir Thomas Pope's friends and of those with whom he seems to have maintained any particular intimacy connection or intercourse notwithstanding most of their names have before occurred incidentally These were sir Thomas More lord Audley sir Richard Southwell sir Thomas Stradling sir Nicholas Bacon sir Thomas Cornewallys sir Francis Englefield sir Robert Southwell sir Edward Waldegrave William Cordall esquire Richard Gooderick John Wyseman sir Arthur Darcy sir Gilbert Gerrard lord Vaulx sir Thomas Brydges cardinal Pole Thirlby bishop of Ely sir Thomas Whyte lord Williams of Thame Whyte bishop of Winchester and Thomas Slythurste president of Trinity college so often mentioned  I need not repeat his last interview with sir THOMAS MORE of whom it will be sufficient to add here that he was the greatest ornament of the English nation at the restoration of polite literature that he was a  man whose life and death are equal prodigies and whose valuable virtues and untimely fate are alike admired and lamented  Erasmus who always preserved the highest opinion of More has with great elegance and truth drawn his character at full length EPIST See also More was among Erasmus's most intimate friends  THOMAS lord AUDLEY made lord high chancellor of England on sir Thomas More's resignation in was probably sir Thomas Pope's particular patron and perhaps not a little instrumental towards his rise in the world as has been already hinted In how great confidence and esteem sir Thomas was held by lord Audley is further manifested from his being appointed with sir Edward North and two others an executor of lord Audley's will  Registr Allen Cur Praerog qu i dat April xix  in which among several other directions they are requested to deliver the next new year's day after his decease one hundred pounds to the king from whom the testator professes to have received  all his reputations

"the sum of cclj  l  to either of the said sir Edward and sir THOMAS"  Few of the favorites of Henry the eighth appear to have more successfully recommended themselves to their sovereign than  lord Audley But although by his perseverance in the business of the Divorce and the dissolution of the monasteries he so gratified the kings private views as  "to sustain according to his own declaration much damage and infamy"  yet the best historians admit that he opposed the dangerous designs of his arbitrary master in a matter of the highest importance In many severe acts were made in which those styled the six bloody articles were included and the prerogative was carried to such an enormous height that the king's proclamation was allowed to attain the force of a law It does not very plainly appear who were his majesty's principal counsellors in this affair but we are assured by concurrent and undoubted authorities that the rigorous execution of those laws which the king had at first intended was prevented by the spirited interposition of lord Audley  See BIOGRAPH BRIT Vol i AUDLEY  But I forbear entering further into the history of this distinguished statesman and lawyer who bore

connected with CARDINAL POLE appears from passages in his letters I have before mentioned his application to the cardinal for obtaining a licence for three of his fellows to preach Sir Thomas Pope in a letter to the president of his college  speaks of procuring a prebend for one Heywood and adds  "my lord cardinalls Grace and my lord of Elie Thirlby are both willing"  In another letter to the same dated he says  "Towching Mr Heywood's recompens I wold be glad to understonde what he wold have and theruppon wold make my sute to my lord cardinall's Grace and my lord of Elie accordinglie  This Mr Heywood was  Richard Hayward  rector of Garsington in Oxfordshire to which he was presented by the crown about August Rym Foed xv p The next year sir Thomas Pope purchased the said rectory of Philip and Mary and annexed it to the presidentship of Trinity college This application to cardinal Pole and the bishop of Ely was undoubtedly to dispossess Hayward by procuring him some equivalent that the president might immediately succeed to the rectory Which appears to have been done yet not without some difficulty nor in consequence of these applications Registr prim coll Trin fol b Arthur Yeldard President was instituted to this rectory on the resignation of R Haywood Sept REGISTR Episcopat Oxon SEDE VACANT fol  "  In another to the same and on the same business without date he says  "my lord

Trinity college should prove a good proficient  in the latin tongue  "I will not fail to sue to my lord cardinall's grace for him"  in order that he  "might as is said in another letter attende uppon his grace"  Of the cardinal's character it will be sufficient to observe that he is more endeared to posterity by private virtues and amiable qualifications than ennobled by birth and dignities Instead of imbruing his hands in the blood of martyrs and loading the consciences of mankind with arbitrary decrees and unnatural edicts he corresponded with learned men and introduced into England the pure and useful elegancies of classical composition  I have before referred the reader to Wood's HISTORY and ANTIQUITIES of the university of Oxford for an account of Pole's visitation of the university I will here add an anecdote relating to that transaction not mentioned by Wood The cardinal finding saint Mary's college where Erasmus had studied but which had been dissolved as a seminary for various monasteries of augustine canons although very ruinous a place which might be made convenient for the reception of students ordered it to be repaired and fitted up for that purpose Sept Accordingly a principal was appointed to it yet on condition that he should resign his office in case the cardinal should ever be disposed to convert the said college into a house of religious The principal's name was Alexander Elcocke AM But John Wayte  lord of the soil  of the said college refused entry to the new principal into the premisses  "ut paret cubicula studiosis"  Registr Cur Cancell Oxon GG fol in Archiv Univ Oxon I know not what was the immediate consequence of this proceeding but it is certain that neither of the cardinal's schemes took effect Erasmus in some of hi  Epistles speaks feelingly of the repose which he enjoyed and the felicity with which he prosecuted his studies for two years in this retired house The chapel no inelegant fabric containing the curious monuments of the founder Thomas Holden and his wife together with the cloister was not completely demolished till the year Nothing now remains but a part of the gatehouse which fronts westward    Sir Thomas Pope submitted to the cardinal the statutes of his college as appears from a letter to the President which while it pays a compliment to the cardinal's taste likewise illustrates what has been before observed about the state of literature at this period  "My lord cardinall's grace has had the overseeinge of my statutes He much lykes well that I have therein ordered the latin tonge  The classics  to be redde to my schollers But he advyses me to order the greeke to be more taught there than I have provyded This purpose I well lyke but I fear the tymes will not bear it now  Vid supr p

cited likewise inform us how far  sir Thomas Pope was connected with THIRLBY bishop of Ely  See also Append Numb xix  He was constituted the first and only bishop of Westminster by Henry the eighth  Burnet Ref  Records  i  He was by Edward the sixth translated to Norwich and afterwards by queen Mary to Ely by whom he was also appointed a privy counsellor  Goodwyn ut supr p  and joined in commission with sir Thomas Pope and others for the suppression of heretics  See supr p  By all these princes he was much esteemed for his experience in political affairs and frequently employed as an envoy to foreign courts In the reign of Elizabeth he was ejected and imprisoned for persevering in popery but was afterwards received into the family of archbishop Parker who not more on account of his former dignity than of his learning candor and affability treated him with due respect and humanity  Goodwyn ubi supr  WHYTE bishop of Winchester became the first visitor of Trinity college in Oxford It is reasonable to suppose that sir Thomas Pope's real motive for appointing the bishops of Winchester to be visitors of his college  originated from Gardiner who was the bishop of Winchester when the foundation was projected and who moreover had been governor of a college at Cambridge was now chancellor of that university a learned civilian a scholar of the first rank an eminent patron of literature  Gardiner's literary character has been commonly overlooked in his political and is rarely regarded or acknowledged He was admirably skilled in the Greek language at a time when it was cultivated in England only by a few neglected scholars His ideas of pure Latinity were refined to a fault and he carried his notions of the chaste Roman phraseology to such a nicety as to be esteemed a Ciceronian by his cotemporaries Leland the most polite classical writer in England at that period congratulates some of his elegant friends on their being educated in the college over which Gardiner presided at Cambridge and which under such a governor had become the seat of eloquence and of the choir of the Muses Leland also characterises Gardiner by the epithet DISERTUS or the master of genuine Latinity and calls him the restorer of classical composition and the study of philology at Cambridge EXCOM p edit Leland paid these compliments before Gardiner was a bishop and when there were no temptations to flattery Many of Ascham's terse Latin epistles are addressed to this prelate in which his distinguished learning his sollicitude for the revival of ancient letters and his general patronage are repeatedly displayed in the highest yet unaffected terms of panegyric In one of these Ascham expresses his great satisfaction that Gardiner who excells all others in critical discernment had so warmly approved his TOXOPHILUS then just published and written with a view to teach a just English style and desires that the bishop  pro eo amore quo literas et earum cultores unice amplecteris  would recommend that book to the king Lib ii p b edit In another he thanks the bishop for honouring him with so many marks of notice and attention when he came an unknown and obscure academic to court He recommends a tutor to the duke of Norfolk's nephew and wishes that Gardiner who is so eminent a judge and protector of literary merit would ratify the choice Ibid p a In a third lamenting the untimely death of king Edward the sixth he petitions Gardiner among other requests to intercede with queen Mary for the continuance of his pension originally granted by king Henry the eighth as a reward for his TOXOPHILUS professing his confidence in the bishop's known erudition authority liberality prudence and activity to quiet the distractions which not only the civil but literary state of the kingdom would probably suffer from that unexpected and calamitous event Ibid p b Dat In the next he presents the bishop then just released from imprisonment in the TOWER at the accession of Mary with a Greek TRANSLATION of the PSALMS probably the METAPHRASE of APOLLINARIUS enforcing the propriety of his present by observing that it was written in a language in which the bishop so much delighted and that poetry had been his chief amusement during the tedious hours of his late confinement Ibid p b See also p a With the next dated as a slender remembrance of the numerous favors he had recently received he sends the bishop an antient golden Roman coin Ibid p a In three or four others evidently written during the reign of Mary he complains of many unjust taxations and oppressive exactions imposed by some late innovators on the university of Cambridge supplicating the assistance of Gardiner as their CHANCELLOR and expatiating largely on his accustomed indefatigable endeavours to support the rights and promote the honour of the university Ibid p b seq In another letter to one of Margaret Roper's learned daughters dated Ascham speaks of being called from Cambridge by the special favour and appointment of bishop Gardiner to serve the queen in the very liberal office of Latin secretary Ibid p b In a letter to the learned Sturmius dated at Greenwich he declares  "I would not exchange the Office of Latin Secretary for any situation in life Bishop Gardiner has treated me with the greatest kindness and indulgence in this affair and I can hardly say whether Lord Pagett has shewn more readiness in naming me to the queen or the bishop in pleading my cause and recommending my character There are some who have endeavoured to stop the course of the bishop's benevolence on account of my religious principles but without effect I therefore am deeply indebted to his humanity and it is a debt which I willingly owe I am indeed but one among many who have experienced his generosity I have often thought of talking to him about your noble work of the ANALYTICS For I well know his predilection to polite letters and think his patronage would be of service on this occasion c"  Ibid p b seq It appears also that Gardiner procured from queen Mary for Ascham a renewal of the royal pension for his TOXOPHILUS with the annual addition of ten pounds

that unhappy period he permitted Sir Thomas Smith one of the restorers of Greek and secretary of state in the reign of Edward the sixth to enjoy the comforts of a studious retirement with a pension of one hundred pounds Strype's SMITH p seq I forbear to enlarge on Gardiner's high celebrity as a civilian and canonist and shall only add on that head that Henry the eighth would take no step in the business of his divorce however eager for a decision till Gardiner could be consulted who was absent at Rome I suspect he was but moderately skilled in scholastic theology  and bore the greatest  sway

Hist ii Goodwyn de Praesul ut supr  the founder by this unexpected change of circumstances was not so far reduced to a state of indetermination and indifference as to wish to depart from his

spiritual matters"  had promised to grant him for the college In another letter dated the same year to the same he says  "my lord of Wynchester has bene sycke with me at Tyttenhanger but now returns

while lord mayor of London  Hollinshed Chron iii  in consequence of which he was knighted by the queen  MSS Rawlins Bibl Bodl  But a similitude of undertakings for the propagation of letters might otherwise have naturally produced a friendship between sir Thomas Whyte and sir Thomas Pope as they were both at the same  time employed in the same acts of public and literary beneficence Lord WILLIAMS of THAME generously concurred with sir Thomas Pope in treating the princess Elizabeth amidst her unmerited and oppressive persecutions with proper regard  See supr p  He is mentioned in a letter of sir Thomas Pope to the president of Trinity college  It is without date Lord Williams is mentioned in another of his letters concerning a purchase    "I wold be glad to lerne whether my lord Williams and Mr Ashfeld  Probably sir Edmund Ashfield of Tame co Oxon  gave the ii Buckes to my college at the act commensement"  Lord Williams having enjoyed many eminent favors from Henry the eighth and Edward the sixth was by queen Mary created a baron in reward for his faithful services at her accession He continued to receive fresh honors from queen Elizabeth and was appointed president of the council in the principality of Wales  Dugd Bar ii  Bishop Ridley when bound to the stake requested lord Williams then present to sollicit queen Mary that the episcopal leases which he had granted while bishop of London to many poor tenants might remain and be confirmed This was  the sole anxiety that disquieted the composure of the dying martyr But lord Williams promised to recommend this petition to the utmost of his power and it was accordingly performed  Fuller's Worthies p Fox Martyrolog    It is natural to suppose that sir Thomas Pope was nearly connected with several other persons of eminence and distinction in the courts of Henry the eighth and queen Mary That he was in high confidence and esteem with the latter may beside many other arguments be concluded from a passage in the statutes of his college by which it appears that he expected her majesty who professed herself so zealous a patroness to the university together with king Philip would honor the college with a royal visit  Statut coll Trin Oxon  "Nisi quando forsan Angliae Reges et Reginae eorumve primogeniti Collegium invisere dignabuntur quos sic quidem advenientes cum omni honore et obsequio excipiendos praecipio et statuo"  cap xxvi    But among his friends I must not forget to mention THOMAS SLYTHURSTE  See more of him in Append Numb XXV  whom he appointed the first President of his college and had before probably preferred by  his interest with the queen to a canonry of Windsor He seems to have conceived a high opinion of Slythurste's learning and prudence whom from the trust committed to his charge we reasonably may imagine to have been a person of distinguished worth and abilities In a general Address to the new society annexed to the statutes of the college he particularly compliments the president for his remarkable moderation of temper his eminent learning experience prudence and probity observing moreover in justification of his choice that he should have acted in vain if he had not added to the benefit of his foundation such a governor so properly qualified in every requisite accomplishment one completely fitted for the difficult and critical task of conducting the first beginnings of a recent institution and to whom therefore borrowing the character of a father in that of a founder he with pleasure entrusted the education of his children On various occasions sir Thomas Pope appears to have placed the greatest confidence in his friendship advice and judgement Many of the founder's letters to Slythurste contain free consultations about adjusting the  endowment amending the statutes  In the first copy of the statutes dated signed by the founder are several erasures and interlineations in the hand of Slythurste made by the consent and authority of the founder and the text of this copy thus corrected is that which is now in use Many of these alterations appear to have been made in this book between them both at Tyttenhanger or Clerkenwell as I collect from a letter from the founder to the vicepresident dat Jan in which he says that he shall send by the president an altered and improved copy of his statutes which he had ordered to be forthwith ingrossed in parchment In another letter to the president dat Feb the founder tells him  "I trust ye will not forget to make an INDEX CAPITULORUM STATUTORUM which we forgott when we were together"  In this copy corrected by Slythurste's hand  London  the place from which they were originally dated is struck out for TYTTENHANGER The  altered and improved copy  mentioned above ingrossed on parchment and signed with his own hand throughout with the ADDITAMENT annexed appears to have been delivered to the society but with the original date of preserved in or soon after April See his letter Append Numb XXV Under JOHN PERTE  and regulating other articles of his young society and sometimes relate to the domestic concerns of his own family I find him frequently visiting the founder at Clerkenwell and Tyttenhanger The sudden revolution however of religion at the accession of queen Elizabeth prevents us from knowing much more of his chaaracter and behaviour in this situation for in September he  was ejected from his headship by the Queen's visitors and committed a prisoner to the Tower of London where he died of grief partly for the death of his honored friend and munificent patron the founder and partly for the loss of his preferments  SECT VIII  AN anecdote equally ridiculous and scandalous has been propagated by Antony Wood highly injurious to the honor of sir THOMAS POPE which notwithstanding it appears at first sight strongly to confute itself I shall here examine and disprove  Although possessed of the proper information and evidence I had long ago and for many reasons resolved never to enter into a particular discussion of this idle calumny But as since the appearance of my first edition of this work it has been circulated both in conversation and by more biographers than one as a pleasant ancedote I could no longer forbear using the means in my power of exposing its falsity and futility  It originated from Henry Cuffe the famous secretary of the unfortunate earl of Essex who was executed soon after his master in  Cuffe being a boy of the most promising abilities and uncommon proficiency in literature was sent at fifteen years of age by Lady Elizabeth Powlett often mentioned above from Hinton saint George in Somersetshire to Trinity college in Oxford where he was elected scholar on the twentyfifth of May    REGISTR PRIM fol b  Within five years he was admitted fellow May  Ibid fol  But even in this situation the same discontented and arrogant spirit which afterwards hurried him to an ignominious end could not be suppressed Soon after his admission when he was now not more than twenty years of age and in the year of his probation he endeavoured to defame his founder by a false insinuation which savored alike of petulance and ingratitude and which had it been true deserved animadversion The matter being reported to Lady Powlett the foundress she transmitted a mandate to the college ordering him to be instantly removed from his fellowship This we learn from the words of the college register  "  Resignante  CUFFO  et locum Litteris Fundatricis dante  Ibid fol b  "  The cause of his amotion is twice mentioned by the Oxford antiquary In the ATHENAE he says that Cuffe  "was forced to resign his fellowship of Trinity college for speaking certain matters though true which redounded to the  great discredit  of the FOUNDER  ATHEN OXON vol i col edit  "  In another place however he tells the whole story without  reserve and produces his authority  "Doctor Bathurst told me that our Cuffe was of Trinity college and expelled from thence upon this account the founder sir Thomas Pope would whersoever he he went visiting his friend  steal  one thing or other he could lay his hands on put it in his pocket or under his gown This was supposed rather an  humour  than of  dishonesty  Now Cuffe upon a time with his fellows being merry said a pox this is a poor beggarly college indeed the plate that our founder stole would build such another which coming to the President's ears he was thereupon ejected  See Hearne's LIB NIG SCAC p  "  The reader must have already noticed the glaring inconsistency of these two curious narratives In the first sir Thomas Pope is by implication at least represented as a thief in the next his dishonesty is softened into humour and jocularity That the whole is a misrepresentation and a jumble of circumstances appears from an original paper in the handwriting of Doctor Bathurst  "Secretary Cuffe was expelled from a fellowship of Trinity college on this account Our founder when upon a visit would often carry away a silver cup under  his gown for the jokesake sending it back the next day to laugh at his friend Cuffe being merry at ANOTHER COLLEGE with some of his boon companions said  A pox this is a beggarlie college indeed the plate that our founder stole would build another as good  These words being told to the President he was ejected This I have often heard from my predecessour doctor president Kettell who was contemporarie with Cuffe  BATHURST PAPERS MSS In the possession of the late Mr Payne canon of Wells  "  In the margin Bathurst has recorded the name of the other college which Cuffe was pleased to treat in such terms of contempt and which needs not here to be mentioned Indeed it was no part of the accusation against Cuffe that as Wood's context insinuates his pleasantry led him to depreciate the buildings of his founder but that he wantonly converted one of his practical jokes a species of humour not uncommon among our festive ancestors into a petty larceny On the whole we now perceive that Wood has inaccurately related this story from a casual conversation with Bathurst which he remembered as imperfectly As to Cuffe I know not whether he still continued at Oxford after this ejection But  having great address and much real merit about three years afterwards that is in the year he was chosen fellow of Merton college Being an admirable Grecian he was about the same time made professor of Greek in the university It was in this department that he assisted Columbanius in the first edition of Longus's elegant PASTORAL ROMANCE which was printed at Florence in  COLL MSS T Hearne vol xiii p Columbanius says in the Dedication p ii  "Qua in re operam mihi suam non ingratam iliam quidem navarunt viri omnium literatissimi atque officiosissimi Herricus CUFFUS Anglus c"  He was no less eminent as a logician and a disputant His intimate friend Camden to whose BRITANNIA at its first appearance he prefixed an excellent Greek epigram characterizes Cuffe as a man of exquisite learning and genius but of a factious and perverse temper  Camd ELIZ p edit Hearn  Notwithstanding the severe check he received at Trinity college he generously presented to the library there several volumes Perhaps some readers will be candid enough to think that his expulsion from this society was rather owing to an unguarded vivacity of disposition than to any malignity of mind Our historians say that the earl of Essex who began after a  tedious confinement to feel the dangers of his situation dismissed Cuffe from his service and family for turbulence and insolence  Camden ubi supr p  Essex was unfortunate in not having before perceived these qualities in a man who shared so much of his confidence  SECT IX  FROM a recapitulation of what has been said the following character of sir THOMAS POPE arises He appears to have been a man eminently qualified for business and although not employed in the very principal departments of state he possessed peculiar talents and address for the management and execution of public affairs His natural abilities were strong his knowledge of the world deep and extensive his judgment solid and discerning His circumspection and prudence in the conduct of negociations entrusted to his charge were equalled by his fidelity and perseverance He is a conspicuous instance of one not bred to the church who without the advantages of birth and patrimony by the force of understanding and industry raised himself to opulence and honorable employments He lived in an age when the peculiar circumstances of the times afforded obvious temptations to the most abject desertion of principle and few periods of our history can be found which exhibit more numerous examples of occasional compliance  with frequent changes Yet he remained unbiassed and uncorrupted amid the general depravity Under Henry the eighth when on the dissolution of the monasteries he was enabled by the opportunities of his situation to enrich himself with their revenues by fraudulent or oppressive practices he behaved with disinterested integrity nor does a single instance occur upon record which impeaches his honor In the succeeding reign of Edward the sixth a sudden check was given to his career of popularity and prosperity he retained his original attachment to the catholic religion and on that account lost those marks of favor or distinction which were so liberally dispensed to the sycophants of Somerset and which he might have easily secured by a temporary submission to the reigning system At the accession of Mary he was restored to favor yet he was never instrumental or active in the tyrannies of that queen which disgrace our annals He was armed with discretionary powers for the suppression of heretical innovations yet he forbore to gratify the arbitrary demands of his bigotted mistress to their utmost extent nor would he participate in forwarding the barbarities of her bloody persecutions In the guardianship of the princess Elizabeth  the unhappy victim of united superstition jealousy revenge and cruelty his humanity prevailed over his interest and he less regarded the displeasure of the vigilant and unforgiving queen than the claims of injured innocence If it be his crime to have accumulated riches let it be remembered that he consecrated a part of those riches not amid the terrors of a deathbed nor in the dreams of old age but in the prime of life and the vigour of understanding to the public service of his country that he gave them to future generations for the perpetual support of literature and religion  FINIS  APPENDIX CONTAINING Original EVIDENCES and PAPERS NEVER BEFORE PRINTED  CONTENTS OF THE APPENDIX  NUMB I THE last will

and its appurtenances together with a part called  half  of Durham college grove to his new cathedral of Christ church This part or  half  I presume was  that  which had been rented as above by Bernard college and was therefore considered at the time of this donation as its usual appendage In the year sir Thomas Whyte purchasing from Christchurch the said Bernard college purchased likewise of the same the part or  half  of Durham college grove abovementioned This part or  half  is what now makes the outer grove and perhaps much more of saint John's college See Wood Hist Ant ii Stevens Monast ii Wood MSS Mus Ashm And especially Numb VII Append Thus the outlet or  grove  in the text included only what remained to Durham college after the aforesaid aliena ion made by Henry the eighth When Trinity college and saint John's were founded the two founders jointly erected the stone wall which now separates the groves or gardens of the two colleges That this was done by agreement between them both I collect from the words of a letter from sir Thomas Pope to the president dat Jul xxiv in which he desires the president to bespeak for him a certain large quantity of stone  "for so much I think I shall occupie  for my part  of Mr sir Thomas White's wall"  Afterwards sir T Pope surrounded the whole grove of Trinity college with a stonewall and I find expended thereon cxx  l  The stone

Oriel college and about the year appointed Principal of saint Mary's HALL and elected one of the proctors of the university of Oxford Upon the accession of queen Elisabeth he retired to Louvain where he wrote his famous book on PURGATORY and PRAYERS FOR THE DEAD which abounds in rhetoric more than argument and contains much ingenious declamation and sophistry Soon afterwards he returned to England where he published many specious apologies for his religion which he dispersed with great art and industry But the treatise just mentioned  was the basis of his polemical reputation As he wrote chiefly for the conviction of his countrymen most of his compositions are in English and are not inelegant specimens of style at a time when the state of our language was rude and unsettled A solid

in whose hand are many notes in the margins Grosthead gave it to the convent of Friars Minors at Oxford These Friars gave it to the famous theologist Thomas Gascoigne under their seal about the year Gascoigne presented it to Durham college at Oxford and at length Allen placed it in the Bodleian library At the end of this manuscript there is a long note written by Gascoigne which Tanner has printed Bibl p All the books belonging to the library of Richard de Bury in Durham college were dispersed soon after the dissolution of that house Some were removed to the Humfredian library and others to Baliol college but the greater part became the property of Doctor Owen to whom Durham college was granted Archbishop Parker procured many Saxon manuscripts of Doctor Owen In the Cotton library there is a volume consisting of a collection of charters and other antient writings transcribed by Jocelyn Parker's chaplain who has inserted this note at many of the pieces  The archbishop of Canterbury had this charter from Dr Owen  At some others  The copy of this Dr Tallot had of Dr Owen  VITELL D Robert Talbot the annotator on Antoninus was employed by the archbishop to collect antient

spoken at large in the SECOND DISSERTATION prefixed to the first volume of the HISTORY OF ENGLISH POETRY He held some of the highest offices both in church and state under Edward the third whose education he had superintended In the year he was sent by that king to Avignon to negotiate some business with the pope Rymer FOED ii He there lodged in the house of cardinal Colonne where Petrarch at that time also resided Petrarch embraced the fortunate opportunity of consulting this learned Englishman then only a private ecclesiastic about the situation of the antient Thule supposed to be one of the British islands for the geography of antiquity was one of Petrarch's favorite studies Being without his books of which he had amassed a prodigious collection he promised to transmitt to Petrarch the best information he could obtain on this subject after his return to England What had immediately given rise to Petrarch's curiosity about this island probably was Giraldus's fabulous account of Thule in his MIRABILIA HIBERNIAE a work just published and recently translated into French by John of Meun author of the  Romaunt de la Rose  Petrarch wrote frequently to Richard of Bury to know the result of his promised enquiries about Thule but perhaps in consequence of Bury's important occupations never received any answer See Petrarchae EPISTOL iii In this epistle Petrarch calls Bury  "Virum ardentis ingenii nec literarum inscium abditarumque rerum supra fidem curiosum"  The ingenious author of LA VIE DE PETRARQUE thinks that Petrarch's letters to Bury are now in some library of England Tom i Liv ii p Amst to I have searched for this treasure but without success See Wharton ANGL SACR i Leland and his transcriber Trithemius are mistaken in what they have asserted about Petrarch's

restored after a long intermission by queen Mary it was difficult to procure instrumental practitioners properly qualified to assist at the solemnities of the mass Under these circumstances in order to facilitate and secure so precarious an acquisition Sir Thomas Pope found it necessary to provide in his statutes that there should be constantly one person admitted into the society competently skilled in music who might be able to execute the office of organist to the college That this was the case the provision itself seems to imply as well as the reason which the founder expressly suggests for it and the manner in which it is worded  "Hic autem quoniam opus est et maxime convenit ut per hanc electionem  provideatur  nequando dictum Collegium ORGANORUM PULSATORE sit  destitutum

learning to sing Not to mention the vast revenues which the church squanders away in the stipends of singingmen who are commonly great drunkards buffoons and chosen from the lowest of the people These fooleries are become so agreeable that the monks especially in ENGLAND think of nothing else To this end even in the Benedictine MONASTERIES OF ENGLAND many youths boys and other vocal performers are

Clarendon's HIST vol iii p edit fol  Thus by the death of male issue and marriage of the female this family and name at least in this branch became extinct soon after the restoration of Charles the second  For from what is here collected on this subject it must appear that our great poet ALEXANDER POPE was related to this family only by some collateral branch I have mentioned all the male issue and their marriages except the marriages of John  and William two younger sons of sir William Pope knight of Cogges both which I suspect died young but if ever married either of them may reasonably be supposed rather too young  The eldest of them John was born Nov If it can be proved that he was the father of the elder Alexander Pope it will follow that Thomas Pope second earl of Downe was his uncle and consequently that sir Thomas Pope the founder of Trinity college was the poet's uncle to a high degree It may perhaps be trifling to mention that ALEXANDER POPE occurs twice as a name in this family in and about Temp Edw iiiMSS Pedigr penes honoratiss com de Guildford  to have been the father of the elder Alexander Pope who was born  Ex Epitaphio  Besides had the poet been descended from either of these two younger sons the title of earl of Downe could not have failed during his own and his father's lifetime Mr Pope tells us that his  "Father Alexander was of a gentleman's family in Oxfordshire the head of which was the earl of Downe whose sole heiress married the earl of Lindsey His mother was the daughter of W Turnor of York She had three brothers one of whom was killed anothes died in the service of king Charles"  Notwithstanding what I have here said I imagine that Mr Pope alludes to Thomas Pope the second earl of Downe whose epitaph I have given no less than to his mother's brothers in the following lines  Of gentle blood part shed in  honour's cause  While yet in Britain honour had applause  EACH PARENT sprung  Warb POPE iv ed    And on the whole from my

University of Oxford tom ii fol Dr Ralph Kettel was president of Trinity college and an excellent governor for near fifty years He had been fellow and scholar of the college for fourteen years during the lifetime of this lady His family lived in her neighbourhood at King's Langley in Hertfordshire She probably sent him to the college where he was admitted scholar Jun Registr prim fol He was chaplain to Bilson bishop of Winchester and to lady Walsingham widow of the Secretary A good old portrait of him in a brown furred gown is in the college Aubrey says that his picture was drawn by Mr Bathurst one of the foundation of Trinity college from memory three years after his death which was a strong likeness SURREY tom v p His Life but with many mistakes and absurdities is among Aubrey's manuscript LIVES in the Ashmolean Museum  The following anecdote is recorded of Dr Kettel which I relate because it is imperfectly told by Aubrey and as it marks the times While president it was his custom to attend daily the DISPUTATIONS in the collegehall on which occasion he constantly wore a large blackfurred muff Before him stood an hourglass brought by himself into the hall and placed on a table for ascertaining the time of the continuance of the exercise which was to last an hour at least One morning after Cromwell's soldiers had taken possession of Oxford a halberdier rushed into the hall during this ceremony and plucking off our venerable doctor's muff threw it in his face and then with a stroke of his halberd broke the hourglass in pieces The doctor though old and infirm instantly seized the soldier by the collar who was soon overpowered by the assistance of the disputants The halberd was carried out of the hall in triumph before the doctor but the prisoner with his halberd was quickly rescued by a party of soldiers who stood at the bottom of the hall and had enjoyed the whole transaction  MS Papers of Dr Bathurst    "ELIZABETHA inter clarissimas foeminas ob
