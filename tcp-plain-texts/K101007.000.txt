their various Employments  Nancy  discovered at her Father's Door on one Side near the Front making Lace  Launch  is seen walking about among the Men    CHORUS  CHEAR my lads and work away  Joyous jolly brisk and gay  Freely toiling through the day  Chear my lads and work away  Launch  advancing from his house  Hark the hammer's welcome sound  Ev'ry stroke  British oak  Makes the British heart rebound  Exit  Nancy  at work  With what joy my thread I'd seize  With what joy my fingers wear  Could I thus with so much ease  Weave a net to hold my dear  Winds and waves now bear him far  Far from Nancy doom'd to rove  Where amidst the din of war  He perhaps forgets his love  Launch  reentering  Hark the hammer strikes again  Ev'ry blow  Britain's foe  Hears reecho'd o'er the main  Chorus repeated  Chear my lads  c c c  Launch  to some of the workmen who advance  That's right my boys always sing while you work a song in my mind makes labour easy  in spite of  mine  and his Majesty's enemies      st Workman    So it had need master Launch for we have enough of it these cursed French Monsieurs find us constant employment  Launch  True but the harder you are drove now the faster we shall drive them byandby  Bell rings  Come come get to your dinners I fancy your stomachs have struck twelve You must recollect too my lads that you are hereby insuring the defence of your country against mine and his  Majesty's enemies      d Workman    Damn your and his Majesty's enemiesfor my part I don't care a chip for 'em and I dare say we shall give them such a welcome if they do come as will make them wish they had staid in their own countrytho'f I'm told it's a bitter bad one  Launch  Why that's the reason they are so desirous to visit ours But lose no time my lads I expect our chief lord down every instant and as he is a great friend to harmony I beg we may have no discord    st Work  How can we help it master Launch when our wives are always complainingit's  unpossible  to keep them in tune for we hav'n't time to wind them up  Launch  But consider I'm a man of consequence principal storekeeper to his Majesty's yard here at Portsmouth and know all the King's secrets and let me tell you if the French should come they'll take your wives away from you think of that    st Work  Why if that's all they'll take away there's no such great matter because why we know the worst of it and I am told as how the French are civil enough to every body's wives but their own    Exit    st Workman      d Workman    Yes yes if that's the worst there's no harm done but damn 'em I was afraid for my religion I was afraid they would have taken away our religion and left us their own and be damned to them    Exit  Launch  to his daughter  Come here Nancy you look gloomy child I hope you are not afraid of the French taking  you  away  Nancy  advancing  No papa I have no such fears I assure you but can you wonder at my being pensive when one I hold so dear is now encount'ring the dangers of the sea or the attacks of the enemy  Launch  I'll tell you what child I'm a man of consequence and I could wish you to think no more of that midshipman that Frederick so mark my words I'm a man of consequence  Nancy  But my dear papa what objection can you possibly have Isn't he son to his worship the Mayor and of equal consequence with ourselves  Launch  Why there now is one part of my objectionquaking tottering neighbour Tremor equal to a man of my consequence who am the King's Officer for life and respected by all his Majesty's workmen whereas the Mayor as you call him is only worshipped by vagrants and loses his honour in a twelvemonth  Nancy  But sir  Launch  Besides isn't he a republican tallowchandler who sells candles to the mob and forces us to light up for liberty and am not I on the other side the question and don't wish to have any hand in such stuff  Nancy  Stuff papa  Launch  Yes child kitchenstuff fit only for such fellows to deal in  Nancy  But sure sir my Frederick is not to answer for his father's folly he is himself a slave to no party and is he not bravely venturing his life in the service of his King  Launch  But what would you think if he should return from that service with only half an eye and a couple of wooden legs peeping through his pocketholes  Nancy  Why love him the better for preferring his country's welfare to his own safetyWhat would the world say if the daughters of England withheld their tenderness from those who most deserved it  SONG  Sure 'twould make a dismal story  If when honour leads him on  Love should slight the cause of glory  Or disdain its wounded son  If his country's rights defending  He should some disaster prove  Pity with affection blending  Will but more increase my love  Launch  Well child I like your spirit but you know I have somebody else in my eye who agrees to every thing I say and thinks just as I do about mine and his Majesty's enemiesmy friend Ambuscade I mean a man after my own heart  Nancy  He may be after your heart papa but he's very opposite to minea capering strutting impudent fencing master always teizing one to death with scraps of old songsI neither like his looks nor his mannersin short sir I wish you don't find him impose upon you very materially  Launch  Impose upon me childa man of my consequence Yes I should like that amazinglyupon me indeed who have the care of his Majesty's Royal Dock and know all the state secrets  Nancy  Yes sir and that I take it is the reason of his seeming attachment that he may get some knowledge of you  Launch  Get knowledge out of me No damn me I defy him to get knowledge out of menobody would ever imagine that I knew any thing  Nancy  But let me beg of you to listen to my Frederick consider sir good men are scarce  Launch  Then learn to be content girlyou have got one good man already for your father hav'n't you would you have a couple to your own share you unconscionable baggage  Nancy  Dear sir you are entirely out of the question but isn't it very natural for a young girl to wish to be settled and  Launch  To be sure it is and so you shall but the men have something else to think of now the country's up in arms at present therefore let me intreat you to keep your's quiet for a time  SONG  When we sound and we thump it  The Drum and the Trumpet  When Britain for vengeance and victory tries  Do you think that our youth  To indulge a colt's tooth  Will abandon their truth  And their country forsooth  To mine and his Majesty's Enemies  When our statesmen and heroes  Like Caesars and Neros  Have carried our arms and our fame to the skies  Then my girl if your mind  Is for wedlock inclin'd  You may say something kind  To all that you find  But mine and his Majesty's enemies    Exeunt  SCENE  The Street    Enter  Tremor  looking cautiously about him    All's safe I thinkyesIcod this French invasion puts one into such a panic that one hardly dare to peep one's head outone's functions are all in a quakescarce eat and drink as we used to donot a feast in the town hall these two monthsdripping will be very scarce What noise is that  starts  oh nobodythen as I'm his Right Worshipful the Mayor the French would be very glad to catch me no doubt well what a dangerous thing it is to be in power I should certainly be thrown into the Bastile they would take no ransom for such a precious captivenozounds what noise is that  Enter  Frederick  Lord who have we here  retiring to the side of the stage  Fred  Hah my father what can be the matter with him  Trem  Oh dear sir I beg pardon for being a little surpriz'dbut pray good kind sir what news fromwhat is it you you dog how came you from sea  Fred  In an open boat sir and just landed this instant  Trem  Why you hav'nt deserted from the ship's crew have you I hope you were not afraid for I hate fear as much as I do the French don't disgrace your family Frederick I hope you'll shine as much as your father has done  Fred  Never doubt it sir I like the rest of my countrymen only wish the French would lay aside their running fights and try a few broadsides with us and we'll convince them an Englishman's heart like his climate though often overcast will soon clear again and shew the world a glorious day  Trem  Give me your handwell son you are a fine longsix I'm glad to see you burn so fierceI knew you were cast in a good mould but I hate fear  Fred  And so do I tootho' I bring rather alarming newsthe combin'd fleet is actually in the channelI was order'd on shore on purpose to give you information  Trem  Zounds you don't say so O lud what shall I dowhat shall I do  Fred  And they are bearing down as fast as they can  Trem  Dear me dear me and I shall be laid hold of first for being in power and who knows but my very friends may turn against meattacked in my own mansion house I may be knocked down by my own macebearer or run through the body with myown sword of state  Fred  Don't be so alarm'd sir you should think of putting the place in a state of defence  Trem  So I willO gracious what a situation Well I will put the town in a state of defenceZounds I'll embody the whole corporationand to encourage them order them two gallons of porter with an allowance of bread and cheese and a pint of wine for the officersDon't you think they will make a good stand  Fred  Doubtless sir if you don't go to fislycuffs yourselvesyou should never smite one another because it gives the public an opportunity of having so many strokes at  you    Trem  Ha ha ha a good hit i'faithbut mumyou know we must not touch up the great whatever we think However if some folks above had done some things below why some things would not have been so middling  Fred  Don't deceive yourself my dear father believe me every nerve of Britain is exerted nor need we fear while our veteran commanders feel all the fire of youth and our infant prince the intrepidity of manhood  SONG  The hardy sons of Britain's isle  Undaunted yield their breath  And chear their country with a smile  In danger and in death  When peace with soften'd brow invites  And ev'ry hour's serene  They seek fair virtue's calm delights  And court the tranquil scene  When hostile troops invade their shores  They move in dread aray  Resentment all its fury pours  And terror marks their way  Trem  Well I'm alive againthere's nothing like a good heart and now for the French  shout without  lord what's that noise  Fred  It's only the shout of the sailors in the harbour  Trem  Is that all I was afraid the enemy was already landed but I'm glad they're not come yet becauseit gives one time for preparation to shew thatone is not afraid of them  SONG  If ever they venture to land on our coast  Myself I will march to attack 'em  And soon they shall learn to know who rules the roast  Odzooks how we'll cut 'em and hack em  Drum beats  Lord bless me they're coming  Good heaven preserve us  This piping and drumming  Has made me so nervous  Come son let's retire and fall into the rear  How I long to be at 'em you know I hate fear  Drum beats  Oh dear  I hate fear  Oh dear c  Exeunt  SCENE III  A Chamber belonging to  Sulphur  various Implements dark Lanthorns electrical Apparatus c c c  Sulphur  sitting at a Table in a Nightgown and Fur Cap Papers Plans c c  Here I am safely lodged without much fear of being discovered well  looking at a plan  this electrical stroke as the doctor said will most likely shake all Europe but I can't help however feeling some qualms in endeavouring to destroy my old native country but have not I more obligations to my new one Am not I sent here as a conductor charged with matter of the first consequenceWell Firebrand  Enter  Firebrand  all besmeared with powder in a dirty apron    Is the wildfire and all the combustible stuff ready  Fire  Yes yes master Sulphur San Benito may take 'em when he pleases they are all ready to light  Sulph  Then extinguish yourself good Firebrand  Fire  I'm out master    Exit Firebrand  Sulph  O that fellow is a man of my own kidney fire is his element a perfect salamander Before he was transported he had burnt down two Methodist Meetinghouses to prevent bigotry three prisons to promote the liberty of the subject and half a dozen of his own apartments to save trouble of moving furniture In another year he would have broke all the Fireoffices in town  Enter  San Benito  muffled in a cloak which he throws aside and discovers the dress of a Catholic Priest    San Ben  Well my dear Sulphur is every thing prepared for execution  Sulph  All is ready thank heaven my good father San Banito  San Ben  That's right that's rightfor from certain intelligence I hear the French are to land this afternoon and I hope ere tomorrow to see the Dockyard in a blaze  Sulph  That will be a bright prospect indeed but have you secured the families in our interest whose consciences you manage  San Benito  Why not entirely the Catholicks are grown more squeamishand will do nothing now to hurt their country for conscience sake  Sulph  How I hate such unconscientious dogs  San Ben  I have indeed prevailed over a married lady of some distinction to favour our plot by giving her absolution for past and indulgence for future intrigues but the husband though a good Catholic cannot be persuaded that he shall live better under any other government  Sulph  Why the man's no fooldamn his sense  San Benito  One thing however I have obtained he has promised me not to drive his cattle up 'till he can't help it  Sulph  Why that is something to be sure for the French will bring very voracious appetites from sea But have you been able to do any good at the camps  San Ben  Not much therethey are so cursed loyal to their country that I believe they wish for nothing better than an opportunity of dying in its defence  Sulph  Pray heaven they may but have you brought nobody over to your cause  San Ben  Yes a fewI have secured twenty Jacobite drummers five disaffected suttlers fifty raw recruits and all the contractors to a man  Sulph  How did you manage that  San Ben  By promising them the Pope's contract for salt fish every Lent season  Sulph  Well done father that was securing their  interest  by encouraging their  principle  but could you not have prevail'd upon them to poison the bread that would have done the business at once  San Ben  So it would but I thought it of no great consequence  Sulph  How so  San Ben  Because they say it's half poison already  Sulph  P'sha this doing things by  alves master Jesuit is doing nothing  San Ben    taking fire    Nothing do you call it hav'n't I made my sanctity the means of introducing me into families in order to betray their confidencehave not I  Sulph  Nonsense what signifies your sanctity it's not the fashion herethe appearance of it indeed was necessary among the saints at Bostonbut  San Ben  Butbut what sirhave not I expos'd my person for your sake hav'n't I written seditious paragraphs in the News Papers for these three months past in order to divide the peoplethe only way the English ever can fall  Sulph  Trifles  San Ben  Hav'n't I kept in pay all the foreign servants in town in order to betray their master's secrets S'blood did not my hairdresser bring over the heads of a plot in Papillotes  Sulph  Well my good father to serve your own purposes  San Ben  Your's Mr Sulphur to carry on your infernal schemes for a set of fellows who have neither gratitude nor recollection  Sulph  False by the Congress  San Ben  Congress senators in woollen nightcaps and flannel petticoatsand generals from shopboards greenstalls and night cellars  Sulph  Oh heavens what defamation  San Ben  A set of hypocriteswho are sending out emissaries to embroil the whole world  Sulph    seizing him by the collar    Zounds you dog I'll warm you however I'll make Europe feel America I will    shakes him they struggle    Enter  Firebrand  who runs in between them with two large lighted matches which he holds to both their faces    Fireb  Why masters you are both in a flame  Enter  Ambuscade  at the other door singing and lunging dressed as a fencing master with a foil c  Ambus  Ha ha    lunging    taking fire gentlemen before your time what an inflammable group you look like the pope the devil and the pretender on a bonfire night be so good Mr Lucifer as to leave us in the dark    Exit Firebrand    Wound me in the sword arm but this is a whimsical way to begin by cutting your own throats instead of other people's fie for shame "  Let the tempest of war  "  singing  ha ha    lunging    Sulph  Why he should not abuse the congress he knows it is a sore part can I help it if the members have not learned to dance  San Ben  And he should not undervalue my services are we not all embarked in the same cause  Ambus  So you are disputing about your gentility are you a very pretty employment for a mongrel American and a discarded Jesuit "  The priest calls the Lawyer a cheat  " Can't you be content to impose upon mankind and laugh at 'em too as I do "  For why should we quarrel for riches  "  ahah  Fencing  Sulph  Well but Mr Ambuscade how stand your affairs with old LaunchHave you play'd upon the weakness of his girl my little merry one  Ambus  What kiss and tell my Buck of Brimstone Hit me in the flanconade if I doWe Frenchmen for you know I was born in Paris tho' I don't choose to own it we Frenchmen I say are form'd for intrigue  For we've nothing more to do  But to swear we will be true  And then we may kiss but mum mum mum  Ha hahSa sa    lunging    San Ben  'Psha pox take love have you got us admission into the dock yard and storehouses can our plan be put in execution  Ambus  All will be ready at the time appointed the consequential old fool Launch and I are hand and glove as thick as mustard  Sulph  Then be sure to bite him hard  San Ben  Certainly always strike when the bosom is open  Ambus  Never fear  me  ha ha certain of my mark open or shut but be sure you be upon your guard gentlemen recollect that great man John the Painter and yet he was hang'd    sings    "  My Gilderoy was a bonny boy  "he was hang'd too  Sulph  A great man Heaven knows John was a pretty fellow if he had not been so indiscreet as to commit a few burglaries he would have merited canonization  San Ben  If you are so nice master Sulphur I'm afraid few of your countrymen will obtain that honour  Sulph  No more of your sarcasms good fatherIf I live I'll hang that Jesuit    aside    Ambus  Come come we must join against the common foe or we shall ruin the cause you are just like the English always quarrelling with their enemies or each other"  Kiss curse you curse kiss you and fight  "    sings    Ha ha    lunging    can't you follow my example are we not going to fire the whole town and do not I appear as happy as if I was going to make all the world so  San Ben  True but quarrelling you know is your profession  Ambus  Yes but there's nothing I dislike so much for all that  SONG  Though I practise the science of arms  Yet trust me I think it an evil  And fighting for me has such charms  That I'd rather shake hands with the devil  shakes hands with both  I aim the blow  At friend and foe  But still I look pleas'd all the while  I hit my mark  Secure in the dark  Retire and advance  Sing caper and prance  And stab all the world with a smile  Toll lol de rol c c  Ex arm in arm  SCENE IV  A View of  Portsmouth  Rampart with a great Gun or two in the back Scene The Sea behind  Nancy  and  Frederick  discovered sitting    SONG  Fred  To win my Nancy's early love  For soon my flame burst forth  In Honour's field I anxious strove  To give it humble worth  The poor desert she deign'd to prize  Approv'd my wellmeant toil  Chear'd my return with glist'ning eyes  And paid me with a smile  Nancy    rising after the Song    Ah my dear Frederick you see your power over me but I am so overjoyed to behold you returned safe from the enemy that I can't help expressing my tenderness  Fred  And believe me my charming Nancy when in pursuit of that enemy your idea would intrude itself and sometimes steal away my attention from duty but to remove every future apprehension give me your hand without delay  Nancy  So I would instantly my dear Frederick if we could only obtain my father's concurrence to place us a little above want for I cannot persuade myself in return for your affection to bring a beggar to your arms  BALLAD  For thee all the hardships of life I could bear  And brave the attacks of misfortune and care  But care and misfortune my mind would subdue  If the friend of my heart would partake of them too  Had Fate from its bounty propitiously lent  Enough but to furnish the cot of Content  The dictates of Love in that cot I'd pursue  For the friend of my heart would partake of it too  But Nancy with nought but her truth to endear  With nothing to lend to Distress but a tear  Can ne'er look for comfort with ruin in view  And the friend of her heart to partake of it too  Fred  The more I admire the generosity of your temper the more I regret your resolution But how are you certain my dear girl your father will not consent to our union  Nancy  I am convinced he will not not only from his inveteracy to yours but from his unaccountable attachment to Ambuscade who cajoles him just as he pleases  Fred  Well then let him keep his consent and his fortune to himself while my country wants a seaman or I have an arm to lift in her defence we can never want a support  Nancy  But let us not be rash my Frederick if we could but convince him that this Ambuscade was some designing fellow which I shrewdly suspect he is much might be done  Fred  You are right  Nancy  They say he is a Frenchman I have seen two strange persons frequently in his company and I cannot but think he has some bad intentions which he endeavours to conceal under the appearance of gaiety  Fred  True I'll watch his motions and probably  Nancy  Hush hush here he comes step behind there quick and you'll probably hear more  Frederick  hides himself behind one of the great guns    Enter  Ambuscade  Ha ha what alone my little love"  Despairing beside the clear stream  "You English girls are so fond of solitude that you are always flying from society  Nancy  No sir I fly from nothing but impertinence which I detest  Ambus  So do I too "None but the brave deserve the fair"    Sings    Ha hahowever tho' I do hate impertinence you look so charmingly today that I must kiss your fair handsDisarm me but I mustO I hate impertinence    Offers to kiss her  Nancy  Sir I must insist on your taking none of these liberties  Ambus  How an English girl and find fault with liberty why it is a rebellion against your constitution  Nancy  So it may sir but should I find myself inclined to make use of the freedom of my birthright you may assure yourself I shall not do it with a Frenchman  Ambus  A Frenchman how came you to think of that Do I carry any appearance of a Frenchman about me  Nancy  Yes the undeniable marks of your countrya fair outside and a false heart  Ambus  Ha ha ha easy and familiarbut that's a certain sign of love Well it's always the samesure of success wherever I go  "  With his  Veni Vidi Vici  came  "  And he conquer'd the world with his rowdowdow  "  I knew you could not

but at present I wish you would take yourself away  Ambus  Do you so sure miss you are not hankering after that sealubber Frederick oh if he was but here but he's now  for powder abroad  Fred    behind    You'll probably find him too hard for your digestion at home    aside    Ambus  Of one thing miss you may assure yourself that I shall never be jealous my jealousy shall sleep in the scabbard and that's a necessary quality in a husband nowadays  Nancy  Husband in the name of heaven  Ambus  Yes my sweet chicken I am in love with you up to the hilts and your father must give his consent soon or I shall fall to without saying grace    Attempts to kiss her they struggle  Fred  Coming forward  Hands off keep your distance fellow  Ambus  Distance zounds 'tis Frederick himself  Fred  What are you muttering there come sir to the right about march  Ambus  To the right about march I don't understand that you and I must have a little trial of skill I dare say he knows nothing of

deny nothing and I confess nothing  Launch  Yes you do both you confess yourself a coward and then deny that you're afraid  Fred  Come sir courage the French as open enemies are not to be dreaded I only fear 'em when they come under the character of friends what say you Mr Ambuscade  Ambus  I am like his worship I deny nothing and I confess nothing  Fred  Well gentlemen let private differences subside while we can wield a sword our country has a right to it and now is the time to show that intrepidity and valour which have always adorned the English annals  Launch  That's right and then a
