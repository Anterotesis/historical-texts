from mankind and had little relish for either the ribaldry or amusements  of the present timesMr Paulet was a clergyman unknowing in the world and unknown to all but men like himselfthe latter part of his life he read mankind chiefly in his study for it was his unhappy fate whenever he wished to take a wider range to experience little more than their falsehood or infidelityHis son by becoming a private  tutor in town for a while afforded him frequent opportunities of hearing what follies were most predominant and from his own letters perhaps it may not be incurious to trace the decent sobriety of the character of the old English gentleman when compared with the inflated maxims of the modern Indian innovatorThe daughter's correspondence likewise will not be totally uninstructive  as it may afford some remarkable instances of the great changes that in a short time may be brought about from the prevalence of Manners over Laws Principles and MoralityIt may be justly urged perhaps that Mr Paulet saw every thing through a contracted medium but however the mind is tempered by virtue or harmonized by religion  I fear there are few good men who can survey the scenes that are continually shifting before them without acrimony or disgustThe mind of man in solitude is torpid and inactive but when cast on the ocean of life it is dissipated and infirmrestless in the pursuit of some hidden good it wears out its sensibility by perpetual motion and confined within the limits of an  unextended empire it contracts itself and becomes gloomy and despondent  VILLAGE MEMOIRS  To Mr Paulet at Sir Wm Russell's CavendishSquare  Dear Charles  WE are all under the greatest anxiety about our friend and neighbour Mr Alringtonhis disorder rages more vehemently than ever and the physicians cannot perceive one favourable symptom of his amendmenthave no time to add further particulars but fear this is only a preface to worse intelligence  will write by tomorrow's postin the mean time your sister joins in all love with your affectionate father  Robert Paulet  Marleston  Feb  To the Same  Dear Charles  AT four o'clock this afternoon I was again sent for not to pray by him but at my own request to pay the last tribute to expiring friendshipHe had no orders to give about either his plumes or his monument"If I have lived well said he my deeds will be graven on the minds of men and I shall have the blessings of the deservinglet the poor be decently supplied on the occasion with all necessaries and if  they loved me they will not wish for superfluitiesI have ever been their protector and they would not I am sure convert my funeral into an hour of festivityI feel an awe but no grief at my dissolutionsome philosophers it is said have been above terrors but I fear they were below humanityto shudder is the part of the guilty to stand undismayed is the language of the Stoic to be humble is the duty of a manbefore the mortification took place I had need of all my resolution but I hope in those moments I confessed virtue on the rack and suffered torture only to refine my ore from its drossThere is I am convinced of it now a counterpoise to all human miserysome hidden resource which  the mind can best supply at its utmost exigencyI feel it now and should think it ill exchanged for all that titles wealth fortune or power could bestow upon me and tho' I am journeying apace to that undiscovered country from which I never shall return I would not wish for one hour of added life for aught but for my friends amongst whom my dearest Paulet I have ever principally esteemed youthus saying he pressed eagerly my hand looked fervently to heavensighedand expiredA scene like this awakened all my feelings and for some moments I experienced an awful something without a nametears and grief had nearly overwhelmed me but I have again recovered my tranquillity for it would  ill become me to fall a victim to distress when my life and my profession demand me to make use of its instructionI have gained by his death a trial of that fortitude which I hope I have not altogether disgracedwhat I have lost you can easily recount with meHe was a man for I must ever dwell on his character who though he had experienced all the falsehood of a bad world had never steeled his heart against the feelings of humanityhe was benevolent without vanity and generous without ostentationhe had a heart perhaps too susceptible of soft impressions which ever laid him open to the designs of the artful and disingenuous so that from the superiority of his understanding he derived a weakness  in his worldly conducthe was warm in his resentments but lest he should be behind hand in reparation paid always over pricehe was skilled in all the necessary truths of the religion he professed and it was no inferior branch of his knowledge that he was ever willing to remain ignorant of those deeper mysteries which its divine Author thought fit to conceal from himhe was to me a patron a benefactor and a friend a friend thatbut I will here close the subject entreating you my dearest Charles to withdraw frequently from the busy scenes of life to contemplate the character of a man which may add fervour to virtue zeal to religion and confidence to truth  I am your affectionate father Robert Paulet  Marleston  Feb  To Mr Paulet c  Dear Brother  FOR all what Mr Pope saysthat people never want to receive letters but from London I have the vanity to think you'll be glad to hear from me tho' confined in this gloom of solitudeWe have had a sad dull winter of it my father being still quite moped for the death of poor Mr Arlington indeed he is a great loss to us all but we hope soon to have ample amends made us by the great man that has just purchased his estatehe came down yesterday for the first time to view it for he bought it only from the fine description that was given of it by the great auctioneer in Londonhis name is Massemhe has a sister who is come to that time  of life when you say we women begin to cast long  Our shadows lengthen as the sun goes down  shadowsthere are a Mr and Mrs Clip who came with them two dependents and a Mr Layout a designer in taste in gardening and no end of servantsI have only seen them as they passed by for they stay but a day or two as Miss Massem says she is indispensibly engaged to go with some duchess or other to the masquerade on Thursday evening nextThe parish are quite delighted with their appearance but my father seems afraid that these great folks should contaminate his flock but I can't see why they should for they say that they will be vastly good and charitable to the poor and when they are down will almost entirely maintain  them without work out of their own kitchenI thought brother you would like to hear a little how we went on and as you will pay no tax for this intelligence I could not help scribbling a few lines tho' it was only to assure you that I remain ever your affectionate sister  Susan Paulet  Marleston  April  If you are not too much taken up with your new office I shall be glad to hear how you like London  To Miss Paulet at Marleston  Dear Sister  I Hope you would not suppose that either the diversions of town or the dignity of my new character as preceptor  would so entirely engross my attention as to make me forget my friendsIt is true this mode of life has not a little engaged both my attention and my wonderI wonder at every thing I see and then I wonder that I should wonder at any thingall here is one perpetual scene of tumult noise and dissipationmankind ever in pursuit of something which when found creates more wants than it suppliesa general siege is laid against an old offender called Time which though every one complains of the loss of yet every one is in league to kill it as fast as possiblethe old maid at Ranelagh may have hopes of making a conquest and the old matron at a rout may be enraptured with spadillebut believe me these are  only secondary considerationsto kill so much time is the principal point in viewfor how can the old maid experience any real pleasure from haunting those circles where she is conscious that she is considered but as the forlorn shadow of her departed beautyor how can the old matron receive any high gratification from returning to those tables where she must reflect if she has not stifled reflection that she can only afford new specimens of the acidity of her temper and the fraudulency of her intentionsindeed she has one consolation that the troops she is engaged with are generally full as corrupt and contaminated as herselfYou will say that the old can have but few prospects and amusementsit is true but they  can have real ones prospects ever brightening as attraction must ever encrease the nearer we approach the objectbut you will now exclaim that I appear already to write from my dictatorial chair and give laws in the true style of a schoolmaster but I can never help expatiating on this subject for it is not so much the comet itself as the tail of that comet that I am so much in care forthere is always some expecting niece or entrusted cousin who to be kept out of harm's way must be the watchful sentinel to all this scene of disordergood Heavens as if the mind could be more in harm's way or more dissipated than by sitting seven hours attendant on a cardtable now and then admiring work perhaps indulged by  introducing her knotting and storing her mind for to read would be ill manners with those remarks only that avarice ignorance and ill humour are continually suggestingand what are the fruits of this miserable farrago every day's experience too fatally evincesYou think I wish to deter you from coming hereindeed I dofor tho' the country I fear affords frequently no better examples yet it is impossible to drive quite so fast on crossroads as it is on a turnpike and there are numbers who can keep themselves afloat on a gentle stream whose strength is yet utterly insufficient to stem a torrentI do not doubt either the goodness of your heart or the firmness of your intentions but remember the wisest and  the best have found the inefficacy of reason against worldly seductionnor do I mean to stifle a generous endeavour or preclude that trial which is appointed to virtueI know both their value and rewardbut considertrue courage consists in combating an enemy nobly that attacks youit is the part of a bravado only to be affiduous for a contest  I see I have run out my letter to an unconscionable length so conclude myself abruptly with duty to my father  Your affectionate brother Charles Paulet  CavendishSquare  April  To Mr Paulet c  Honnurd Sir  HOPING as how your honnur will excuse my bouldnes I truble your honnur to tell you that I have lit of a mishap and am afeard my old measter should know ontI have Sr for a long time been after one Jane Felly the weelrites dawter and now sir she wants to be married to me seeing as how shes in a full condition for itto be sure sir I have savd a little monney in sarvice and if your honnur would but be so good as to get her a place in London if it was neer such a bad one I think the thing might be soon hushd upI dont at all mind what a place it is seeing as how it is  for nothing but a kiver indeed the worser the better as they say as it is only for a timeI have no friend on earth to ply to but your honnur and indeed I need not have one more cleverer for this or any thing else if your honnur would but be so kind as to sarve me int and say nothing ont to my old measterso hoping for your goodness I am your dutiful sarvant  to command John Cuttle  Marlston  Apr  To the Revd Mr Paulet at Marleston  Dear Father  I Now sit down to give you some account of the pupil who is entrusted to my careHe is a young man of rank and fortune and not totally devoid  of literary attainmentsfor a short time he has been at Westminster school but as too frequently is the case has been so much taken off by the diversions of the town that it was well if in the course of the week the Masters were able to remove that love of dissipation which the young man had imbibed the preceding days of ithowever before I came to him he could tolerably construe some of the easier classics and he is by no means deficient in point of natural abilitiesby the death of his mother he is now committed to the care of an uncle who for a year and a half has placed him under my directionwhat my mediocrity shall be able to impart I know not but attention will not be wanting and I have a father ever  able and willing to supply all my deficienciesmy present endeavour is to improve his taste by furnishing his mind with the best criticisms on ancient literature such as Warburton's on the th Book of Virgil and Hurd's on the Art of PoetryBy the aid of these books I perceive his mind to be wonderfully enlarged and he has already remarked that the fame of the commentators ought nearly to equal the glory of their respective authorsfrom hence you will gather that he has Feeling which in preference to every other consideration ought principally to be improvedHe has just asked my opinion of the Ramblers which says he I find are generally considered as pompous and pedanticI tell him that the Ramblers are my  manuals and I can more properly apply the words of bishop Burnet to them than to any other modern productions  "That they are the storehouse of all moral virtues"  I fear he thinks I have strong prejudices for he often observes that the world speaks quite otherwiseas to the world I tell him there are but few who are capable of judgingthose that are either through envy or other malignant passions will rarely do justice to living authorsJohnson would be more read was his matter as thinly spread as in other periodical publicationsthen he has written on party subjects and this can never be forgiven by his vanquished opponentsWarburton is not less obnoxious on the same accountindeed so far I will  accedethat the one by long dealing in words has too much encreased the vocabulary and the other by dealing too much with mankind has at length exceeded the decent limits of all sober satirebut truth and virtue were their guides and whilst these remain in the world such authors will ever be considered as their brightest ornamentsan old gentleman was by chance present at this dialogue between my pupil and me who hastily exclaimed "Good God sir why I never heard a syllable of all this in regard to either of them and I have resided the greatest part of my life  The bishop of Gloucester lived at Prior Park near Bath and the author of the Ramblers in Johnson's Court Fleetstreet Editor  at Bath except two months that I lived with my brother in Fleetstreet  I am c C Paulet  CavendishSquare  April  To Mr Paulet c  Honnurd Sir  NOT hearing from your honnur so soon as was expected we hope now that you will know nothing of the matter for we have gotten a lisense and are married and all is well agenshe thinks she shant be lighted of near three months and thats longer by two than her mother was and by all three than almost any other woman in the parishI am afeared of nobody saying ought about the matter but my old measter but you  know Sr he is very partickler this waybut if he should sir I must tell him that neighbour Snarles wife was church'd and married and the child cristned and all the same day and thof to be sure my old measter made a bogle ont yet you know he was blig'd to do it after all and the child for ought I can see was born in as good wedlock as mine will behowsomever I must do as well as I can by her now and hope God will prosper my honest endeavours thof to be sure I should be sorry if my old measter was disoblig'd by it  I am your dutiful sarvant to command John Cuttle  Marleston  May  To John Cuttle at Marleston  John  TO little purpose has my father explained to you the duties of religion both in and out of church if at your time of life you have made no better use of themtho' you ought not to desert the creature you have debauched yet there can be little prospect of happiness where the foundation is laid in iniquityit is not a number of bad people in a parish that can sanctify a bad action and whatever may be the opinion of your neighbours that will not or ought not at least to lighten the burden of your own consciencewhat you have done is in open violation of your duty and in  express disobedience to the laws of your Godyou and your guilty partner must repent of your errors and where you may have little hopes from the justice of the Almighty through his mercy you may have full assurance of pardon  I wish you well and subscribe myself your friend C Paulet  CavendishSquare  May  To Mr Paulet c  TO day I have paid a visit for the first time to our great neighboursOh Charlessuch a visitI was accosted with  "So Dr I reckon you'd be glad to wet your throat after talking so long to your parish  pray be free and call for any thing you like hereyou need not stand mearlymouthed as if you was with some of your halfstarved country 'squirescall about you man says hewe don't cupboard the bottoms of the bottles herewhy egad my servants in the kitchen live grander than all the gentry hereabouts put together"    "Gentrysays miss Massemrabble you mean brother"  I only replied that I rarely drank wine in an afternoonthe conversation then chiefly ran on their own grandeur and the ignorance and poverty of their neighboursafter teaMr Layout favoured us with Remarks on Taste in Gardening alas how different from poor Mr Arlington's which by the bye I shall select for  you from his papers and Miss Massem insisted on my looking at her Trou Madame table for tho' she knew she said that I would not be so wicked as to play of a Sunday yet she declared that I should look at itI told her that I supposed it might be as innocent as any other game but that I thought the Sabbath might be full as well enployed  "ay but how Dr says the 'squirefor there's no visiting hereabouts and we never go to church though in compliment to you we shall always send the servants"  I hoped they would come from a better motive  "ay ay says he those sort of people like to show their best clothes"  Mr Layout observed that Sunday was only fit to travel on and Miss Massem added that at best it  could only be considered as a horrid  Bore  "I would have it now says the nabob as in foreign parts all life and jollity and dancing and not keep it as they do here just as tho'f it was a Fast"Perhaps sir said I if limitations could be set to amusements it might be an improvementproper recreations are as necessary for the mind as the body and when seasoned with temperance keep both in equal harmony but the misfortune is that where no line could be drawn people would soon go from the fields to a playhouse from the playhouse to a rout and from a rout to a masquerate  "Well says Miss Massem and suppose they did it would be much better I think than to stay at home and be all out of humour with one  another"  I certainly agreed with her that it would if that must be the necessary consequenceThis short dialogue throws a strong light on their respective characters and when I consider what a total change such a family may bring about in a village I reason upwards and look with horror on an infected kingdomif time and reflection can work any improvement I shall gradually inculcate better notions at present it is in vain to attempt to sow good principles in a soil not formed for their receptionYour sister joins in all love with  Your affectionate father Robert Paulet  Marleston  May  Pray write oftener for old folks though they are thrown out of the world love to hear what is doing in it  To Mr Paulet c  Dear Brother  THO' my father seems to dislike this new family and to be sure they have some odd ways with them yet upon the whole they are vastly agreeableMiss Massem has taken great notice of me and was so kind as to send for me the other evening to make up a danceyesterday she took me with them to return Sir John Oldbury's visitOh Lord they are so queer and so formalto be sure we laughed immoderately all dinnertimeMiss Massem declared that if every thing had not been as awkward as it was she should never have refrained at the sight of poor sir John's periwig to say nothing of his antiquated wife  and his two full blown daughtersto be sure miss Massem said they meant to be very civil but they were almost too bad to visit however as they were her nearest neighbours she would always endeavour to make an annual sacrificeAs to Mr Massem he said it was much the same what places he visited at for most of our country gentry kept such bad cooks that he should always be obliged to get away as soon as possible that he might make an early supperand for the future if he must visit sir John he should always go out of principle on an AshWednesdayHowever they know nothing of all this and if they did not see us laugh I believe took the visit very kind and friendly  I am your affectionate sister Susan Paulet  Marleston  May  At the ball I had the honour to dance with captain Glanville who is reckoned one of the finest gentlemen in England he was most excessively complaisant to me tho' all the other ladies in the room were much my superiors  To Miss Paulet  Dear Sister  I Thank you for every remembrance of mebut if you won't take it quite ill I must rally you a little about  day visiting  to be sure it is considered as a mark of friendship and esteem but I believe in general that it proceeds from little more than a love of dissipation or to gratify an idle curiosityI remember paying a visit of the sort you speak of and  could not help reflecting how little amusement there could be either to the  entertainers  or the  entertainees  Those who are to  entertain  are anxious for the dignity or propriety of the treat and where there is much anxiety there can be little or no comfortthen if any awkward circumstances should occur as the world now goes they know they will be the talk of the whole neighbourhood and where servants are not always in trammels some will spill the beer and others trample on your favourite lapdogOn the other hand those who are to be  entertained  as soon as they have swallowed their dinners talked of the wine the weather and the roadsheard perhaps that sir John Strictly's hares are all snared or that Dr Meanwell  has got into a fresh dispute about tythesare absolutely told that the coach is at the doorthis is all the regalement unless perchance the ladies at tea have just had time enough to inform them that the Dr's daughters are grown as fat as porpoisesnothing more is to be done but to pack uprecall the coachman who has just stepped back for one more draught of aleto express great satisfaction for the entertainment they have receivedhope that the family will return the visit as soon as possible which will make them most inexpressibly happy and lo the last lagging footman is just come out to take his horseWellall ceremonies are now passedand as they are safely out of hearing it is high time to turn every thing into ridicule  or to recount the miseries of the day  "To think says one lady of all the trouble I had with my hair and to see no more companybut that is always the case whenever I am well dressedthe next time I declare I'll visit in my nightcap"    "Lord says another I knew very well what the visit would turn out and put on a last year's negligee on purposehowever we have certainly been of use to themwe have aired their plate reviewed their footmen and thinned their poultryyard"  Thus the badness of the roads is beguiled with low sneers and petty detraction till the party congratulate one another on their safe return to their own homefor awhile they sit mopeddiscontentedcall for the  cardtable one hates  whist  and another abominates  quadrille  are all killed with the fatigues of the day but as home is of all places the worst a servant is immediately dispatched to poor old lady Humdrum's to acquaint her that they will do themselves the honour of waiting upon her ladyship on the morrowThus is life wasted without either profit or amusement and people presume to thank their stars that they can lead useful and rational lives whilst Mr Pedant is poring over his books and Mrs Conserve is employed in writing out new receipts to preserve apricots  I am c c Charles Paulet  Cavendishsquare  May  To Mr Paulet  Dear Charles  MY time of late has been much taken up in assisting the executors to settle Mr Arlington's affairswe now find that from the very advantageous sale of the estate after paying off all the debts there will be something left very considerable for his relationsa circumstance which could he have known poor man would have greatly contributed to have brightened up the evening of his daysbut to wave this melancholy subject  So ignorant Charles was I of the world that I did not know it was one great instance of politeness to go up to town only just to come down again  and that with such rapidity that a bystander might fancy that the national welfare depended on their speed  We  have now brought down with us I assure you as part of  our  retinue a domestic chaplain Mr  Pliant  so silken so supple and so complying that I could almost fancy him to say to his patron  "Is it your pleasure sir to believe in God"  He is I find on enquiry a distant relation and seems thoroughly broke in to the office he is to fillyesterday as I was returning from my usual ride I met him like  Justice Overdo  in the comedy in quest of enormities and we really enjoyed a very pretty kind of a chitchat till at length some how or other I dropped out something about servilities  "Servilities" says he "now I reckon  you think that I am forced to submit to some servilities as you call themno sir let me tell you my mode of life is perfectly agreeable to meMr Massem keeps a good table has the choicest liquorsand though your country hereabouts to be sure is dull enough yet we have always company in the house to pass away the time withand as for business I have nothing to do but to dust the booksclean the birdcages and now and then make rebusses for the ladiesindeed if we had not some amusements amongst ourselves it would be dull enough here for I have been sauntering about" says he "for these two hours and cannot meet with any one thing worthy the least observation"    "Surely" says I "sir nature  to a mind capable of reflection like yours every where presents a fund of entertainmentto a man who knows how to take a ride this blade of grass or this declining hill affords an infinite scope for contemplationin this sequestered scene methinks I could say with Shakespeare that I  " Find tongues in trees books in the running brooks  Sermons in stones and good in every thing"  but if this retired prospect delights you not I will return with you to the top of the hill and present you with an object that may call forth all your attentionthat is at once a cure for pride and a lecture to ambition  that reminds philosophy of its true end and makes none but the ignorant tremble to behold itit leads the languid to hope allays the the thirst of avarice and places wealth on its true foundationto you and me sir it may be the vehicle to happiness a car more triumphant than ever graced the conquests of a Caesar or an Alexander"    "Good God sir" says my companion "what can you meanI can see nothing but a HEARSE"  In short Charles as I found the present delighted him not I thought it by no means unfair to raise his prospect to Futurity  I am dear Charles c c Robert Paulet  Marleston  June  To Mr Paulet c  Dear Father  I Intended by today's post to have sent you a string of political reports with some large extracts from speeches said to have been lately made in the house of commons but as I find the former are nothing but reports and the latter like dying confessions were printed beforehand I now sit down with an absolute determination to give you nothing but the truth  The grand vehicle of business in this metropolis appears to me to be a  Lie  it rises in the morning with the watchman bawling out  Half an hour past eleven o'clock  and accompanies the 'prentice home who pulls out his  watch with great eagerness to convince his master that it has not yet struck  twelve  through the regions of darkness its operations perhaps are better supposed than described for it stands not unveiled in open daylight till it is circulated through the Strand by paragraphs postcripts letters and advertisementsfame in the shape of a newscarrier sounding the trumpet before itBy its aid the tradesman and his wife are enabled to drink their coffee and by its aid the tradesman and his wife are enabled to drink that coffee comfortably for scandal like irreligion gives a relish to many enjoymentsBut now the whole city is in a ferment for there its mornings are monopolized and it is  exchanged  and  brokered  about to greater  or less advantage from its different degrees of sanctity in great wigs and its more or less solemnity in city facesindeed it is never a moment unemployed there but at dinnertime when it steals away to meet the statesman on his return from the gamingtable or the stewswith him it holds a levee where it is decked in smiles and graceswhat it has lost in weight it has gained in politenessand lends to expectation even the confidence of successthe veil indeed is never taken off for the promiser gives a hundred to strengthen one till time alone convinces you of the uncertainty of a future dayyou now plead loudly for admittance but tomorrow is called in to the juggler's aid for this afternoon he is engaged to vote  against  the Articles  and at night he must negociate with a Jew ere he dares to show his face again before the waiter at Almack'sbut his servants perhaps are townbred and are taught to descry want and necessity by intuitionLying is their professed science for what mischiefs might not ensue if through ignorance a stranger should be let in to see a patriot barter his integrity or a fair one her reputation and her virtueif mistakes like these should arise  Honour  must be called in as a safeguard here as  Goodness  is the security of the citybut the evening advances and it is now sold wholesale at theatres lectureshops and all other places of public diversionlike Scrub it may be said to be of all professions  "one day  it drives the coach another it drives the plough another it draws warrants and another it draws beer"  it seems to be the desideratum of the philosopher for it operates universally from the speech that is administered at noonday to the dark slander that is only launching into whisperhoodthe poet relies upon it for his dinner and the politician for his paythe divinebut holdhere it can be of no use except now and then to explain a texttill it openly stands confessed and by a  nolo episcopari  becomes a passport to a bishoprickin short where is it not of use except in the uncontrouled intercourse between a tender and indulgent father and an ever dutiful and affectionate son  I am c C Paulet  To Mr Paulet c  Dear Brother  I Am so angry at your last letter that I could almost resolve not to write to you any moreI told Miss Massem some of your Remarks on  Dayvisiting  and she says that if you give into a way of being so severe you will never be a favourite amongst the ladiesbesides brother I receive so many civilities from this family that I should tax myself with the height of ingratitude if I endeavoured to give you an opportunity of turning their foibles into ridiculehowever as I dare not trust you with my own remarks I have at my father's request transcribed some of Mr Arlington's which I doubt  not but you will find both valuable and entertainingthe next opportunity he has of conveying a packet too large for the post he will send you according to promise  Strictures on Landscape Gardening    I am c Susan Paulet  July d  Marleston  Remarks from the late Mr Arlington's Papers  I  Men are frequently most desirous of talking on those subjects they least understandfor the same reason perhaps as ladies at ninetynine affect to have the toothach  II  Addison  a man of great judgment in other branches of literature is  scarce ever right when he criticizes the old English language  III  No man can properly criticize Milton who has not carefully studied Euripides  Mr Arlington here probably alludes to  Sampson Agoniftes  many passages of which appear evidently to be borrowed from thence    IV  There ought to be an act of parliament against burying authors of eminence under their own ruinsSwift will soon be an example of this  V  It has been objected against studying Thucydides that he wrote a large folio comprising only a very short periodthe time indeed is short but the writer made ample amends by  the force of his descriptions and the sublimity of his styleand it is a sufficient encomium perhaps to say that he was studied by Demosthenes and imitated by Sallust  VI  Mr Pope's Essay on Man is certainly a very masterly performance in point of poetry but the philosophy contained in it is flimsy and unconnected  VII  Sterne will be immortal when Rabelais and Cervantes are forgotthey drew their characters from the particular genius of the timesSterne confined himself to nature only  VIII  Till my uncle Toby appeared I had used to assert that no character was  ever better drawn than that of sir Roger de Coverly  IX  A man may as well give himself the trouble to copy nature as Sterne  X  How much soever the ancients might abound in elegance of expressiontheir works are very thinly spread with sentiment  XI  Education should be the mirror of former prejudices  XII  I have frequently thought that the duty of visiting the sick should not be vested in the priest for who knows but the constant sights of dying persons may in time render their hearts  like those of butchers and surgeons callous and void of humanity  XIII  A man by swearing may draw down a curse upon himself but never one upon his neighbour  XIV  It is said by Tacitus that men lose their respect for you in proportion to the favours you bestowbut as few perhaps know how to give with delicacy as others to receive with proper gratitude  XV  The parliament of England is formed in a manner not totally dissimilar from that of the ancient council of  The general attention of this assembly and the invariable object of all its modellers and directors was to form a complete representative of all Greece as the good of each individual was subservient to that of his community so the good of each community was considered as subordinate to that of the whole nation Their  was the man who considered himself as a member of the state who submitted his conduct to the laws who acted intirely under their direction who gained popularity not by flattering the people but by procuring their good on the other hand the inhabitants did not confine their regards to their own private affairs they did not consider public difficulties merely as they affected their own tranquility or that of their families they were taught to regard their country as a common mother to whom they belonged no less than to their natural parents While these principles preserved their due vigour and influence Greece continued a really united body happy in itself and formidable to its enemies but as soon as the nation began to degenerate its representative of course shared in the corruptionand this degeneracy encreased so fast that at length we read the most of those who were deputed to fit in this once famous council of Amphictyons were so corrupt that they even came prepared to earn the wages of iniquityto devote themselves intirely to the service of the crafty and the enterprising who could pay them most liberally without regard to their own honour the interest of the community or the general good of Greece  Vid B of Meaux and Dr Leland c  Amphictyons or as it is called by Demosthenes the whole Hellenic body  XVI  The character of the king of Prussia in many of the most remarkable strokes of it strongly resembles that of

Because Plato  "reasoned well"  Cato is said to have fallen on his swordI fear it is because our modern infidels reason ill that they so frequently become Suicides  To Miss Paulet  Dear Sister  IT would be one of the most melancholy hours of my life if I could suppose myself capable of giving you any just grounds of offencethat you might not be caught with the glare of falsehood instead of reality I have ever endeavoured to give you all the caution in my powerfar would I be from debarring you of the least pleasures that are reasonable but wish you only to be moderate in the pursuit of themif caution of every kind comes not best from a brother from whom can it come He can have no interest but yours nor any struggle or competition but who shall make most happy the tenderest and most affectionate  of parentsbut I will not suffer myself to suppose that you have ever felt the least resentmenton all subjects let me speak the free sentiments of my heart as you must ever be convinced of my utmost sincerity and affection  I am c C Paulet  PS Pray tell my father that in his next I hope to receive his permission for my going into Orders that as soon as possible I may alleviate the burden of those expences which have already I fear fallen too heavy upon him  To Mr Paulet c  Dear Brother  I Received your last  kind  letter and now sit down to give you some little account of the jaunt I have just taken with my good friends into DerbyshireMy father for a long time was against my going but Miss Massem did every thing in her power to teaze him into itAt Derby we saw the Silk mills and what I liked much better the New assembly room and the China manufactory but we staid there only a short time for there was a low family who found out Mr Massem and was exceedingly troublesome and impertinent to him so in the evening we went to Kedleston where we  had a very tolerable dancenext day we saw lord Scarsdale's which is very fine to be sure but Miss Massem found great fault with the furniture of the house and Mr Layout who was with us allowed no part of the garden ground to be disposed in tasteMr Massem admired nothing but the large pillars and captain Glanville thought there was a great deal of idle money thrown away upon the libraryas for myself I liked every thing but particularly the sideboardfrom Kedleston we went to Matlock which if it was not for the company would if possible be ten times more dismal than Marlestonhowever we danced and went upon the water with music and drank tea at the boat house and upon the whole  passed our time very agreablyfrom thence we went to Chatsworthit proved a most charming day and we were all enraptured with the waterworksin some places cataracts of water fall down stairs twenty yards deep and in others the water is forced up into the air to the most incredible height to say nothing of the artificial tree which would have sprinkled us all over from its leaves if it had not been out of orderfrom Chatsworth we went to Buxton where we joined parties with lord Canvass and Dr and Mrs Grudgensat first they took no notice of us but as soon as they found out who Mr Massem was they were particularly complaisant and civilMy lord is most exceedingly engagingbut Dr Grudgens talks of  nothing but eating and prefermentand then so suspicious that in a morning when he played at  allfours  with captain Glanville if the hand was not out before the bell rung he was sure to keep the cards in his pocket all the while he knelt down to say his prayersindeed prayers here are merely made a farce offor people laugh and whisper the whole timetho' it would not signify much if they did not for what with the howling of dogs the bawling of footmen and the giggling of ladies maids in the passages it would be utterly impossible to hear one syllable that the parson saidpoor manI was really quite sorry for him and my father would have been absolutely shocked for the company had used to pay him  more or less just as they won or lost at cardsindeed I thought he seemed to have no advantage but that of saying grace at the head of the table whilst the ladies were fighting for the wings of the chickensBut I must tell you one circumstance that happened about Mrs Grudgensone day she was very busy in carving an immense goose that stood before her when captain Glanville desired her next neighbour to help him to some apple pyeMrs Grudgens with all the good nature in the world came immediately out of the goose and plunged directly into the pyeto be sure she was elbowdeep in sage and onionand the captain was so unlucky for he is a man of vast wit as to set all the company into a loud laugh  by calling out  "For heaven's sake madam stopI asked for apple pyeI did not mean a medley one"  Whether you are at all entertained with my letter or not you will see at least that my resentments are of no long continuanceand that I am as much as ever  Your affectionate sister Susan Paulet  To Mr Paulet c  Dear Charles  I Must still think you too young to go into ordersI may be particular in my notions perhapsbut I will chearfully streighten my own circumstances to approve my sincerityIt has been well observed that  "young men are apt to mistake the completion of their academic courses for the completion of their theologic studies"  a mistake which inclines them to aspire to teach others seeing the rather as St Paul expresses it that they ought to be taught themselves"Those who are appointed to explain the oracles of God should have attended to them most particularlyotherwise they may soon be caught in the delusive snares of modern infidelity or wax old in the pernicious system of not changing  "the posture of defence and of keeping to strong holds"  And I am sorry to observe that true religion has nearly suffered as much from the one as from the otherOur Saviour perhaps has confined the practice of  our duty within the limits of his own sermon on the mount nevertheless as a divine it will be required that you should be able to give a rational account of the faith that is in youa rational and a cautious one let it always be for the Scriptures in the hands of controvertists have generally been wrested to the most infamous purposeseach man insisting on that being irreligion which was only not consonant to his own prejudicesSt Augustine I know asserts that  Dictum est tamen non ut aliquid diceretur sed ne taceretur Aug de Trin lib vc  "when any enquiry is made it is not necessary that you should say any thing to the purpose but well or ill that you should always keep talking"  but none but  such a saint would have said it and this very assertion with me would invalidate his whole authorityIn regard to studying the Fathers in general I can only say that I hope they were sincere but by their strange interpretations to say no worse of them they have opened a door to ridicule and from their absurdities modern infidels have sought occasion to undermine the main fabrick of religion itself What can be said in excuse for writers where some endeavour to prove that it was necessary there should be only  Quatuor quoniam quatuor sunt partes orbis terrae c Aug de Cons Evang lib i it Vid Iren lib iiic Theophyl Prooem in Matth  four evangelists because there were only four elements four climates four cardinal  winds and four cardinal virtues and others  Si Filius sederet ad dextram Pater sederet ad sinistram  that Christ could not ascend to sit at the right hand of God for if he sat at the right God himself must sit at the left"These are not merely the testimonies that Voltaire Rousseau or even Dr Middleton may bear against them but the more certain testimony that they bear against themselvesfrom what I have said therefore think no scorn to trace the causes of their mistakes but by no means presume to determine essentials on their fallacious authority And let me require you never to raise scruples in the minds of well disposed people under the pretence of preaching against infidelity for if your arguments  are ever so cogent you cannot strike at any great number for very few infidels will ever be your hearersand there is no such thing as a Sect of Freethinkersit is just as ridiculous as Dr Bentley observes  Phil Lips  as to talk of a rope of sand  And let me particularly enjoin you never to take up ill opinions of or denounce against any man merely on account of his sect or partyfor as our Saviour says  "In his Father's house there are many mansions"  so I have no doubt but there are many ways that may lead to them  Enthusiasm is the growth of a narrow mind and a heated imagination infidelity is the result of false reasoning  and a wicked biassfrom the former we are empowered to believe  "a solid system of old wives stories"  and from the latter that though the history be ever so authentic we ought never to believe at allwhatever may be their difference in another world in this they equally tend to gloom madness and desperationby not calling in our reason we debase the religion we profess and by calling in too much we are apt to invalidate faith reject revelation and then our minds will extravagate through all the wilds of error and absurdity  I am ever your affectionate father Robert Paulet  PS In regard to the present dispute about the Articles my own opinion is that no other test should be required than the Apostles Creed but this opinion is not orthodox  To Mr Paulet c  Dear Father  I Am just returned from Sadlers Wells which does not only lower my idea of the times but even of human natureI do not so much reflect on the entertainment itself as it is called as on the cruel means that must have been made use of before the managers could have procured so dreadful an exhibitionwhence can arise the pleasure of seeing children suspended in the air or tossed about  at the utmost hazard of their lives to gratify the avarice of unnatural parents But indeed the country affords almost as strong instances of cruelty as town for wrestling singlestick or even football are never considered as diversions by the common people but as attended with danger mischief or bloodshedbut in town what shocks me most is that continual flocking to executionsin the country from the less frequency of them even butchers weep but here they are accounted the next diversions to Sadlers Wells and by use men can see a monkey dangling from a wire or a fellowcreature expiring at the gallows with equal unconcernhow much care therefore should be taken to inculcate the principles of humanity  in youth a term which in general I believe is mistaken for cowardice how little care indeed is taken even amongst the higher ranks of people who suffer their children unmercifully to treat the whole brutecreation and then wonder that in time they become cruel enemies and undutiful childrenthey think not how early these inhuman principles are imbibed they begin indeed in infancy only with torturing flies but they end in delighting to view the most horrid murders of the inquisition  At other places of great resort a dog shows you what it is o'clock bears dance minuets and sparrows countrydances but such exhibitions ought not to be allowed in a civilized country for no valuable discoveries  are likely to be made from them that can any ways atone for the tortures which the birds or animals must experience in the training  You find I am desirous of seeing every thing once and giving you my free thoughts as they flow without staying to marshal them in any order I return you my best thanks for the kind advice contained in your lastand wish to receive more hints on the same subject  remain c Charles Paulet  To Mr Paulet c  Dear Charles  THE alterations already made at Marleston are so great that I hardly know my own villageMr Massem every day makes purchases of ground no matter at what expence that Mr Layout may at least acknowledge he has scope enough for his invention I hear of nothing but Obelisks Statues Gazebos Terminations and a Laurelbeltthey talk of taste just as if it was to be brought down in a broadwheeled waggon and they had nothing to do but to scatter it at randomMr Layout thinks there should be a clump and there is one the 'squire thinks it would look pretty  to cut a vista through it and it is cut and his sister thinks she should like a dairyhouse near the spot and she builds itso that at last it will be an  Olio  a  Christmas Pie  a  Solomon Gundy  or perhaps a  Fool's Coat  I must own it rather grieves me to find that the grove on the right hand where the rustic seat was with the motto of  Hae latebrae dulces si jam credis amoenae  should be condemned to be cut down as well as the large one which Mr Arlington had used to call Shenstone's Grove for the urn to his memory was prettily executed and the placing of the statue of the Sibyl in front of it which seemed to exclaim  Procul O procul este profani  was in my opinion a very happy thoughthowever they are all to be swept away to make room  as the 'squire informs me for a fine Mercury  with his quiver  and a Hercules  with his trident  I fear some how or other these Latin mottoes have called down vengeance on the groves themselves for I am sure that neither he nor his chaplain can construe theminstead of these venerable shades a paltry shrubbery is to be planted which is to be decorated as the 'squire would say  "with all the monsters of the internal world"  By what I see of the intended alterations of the water it is destined to take any course but its own for the merit of every thing seems to consist only in the sum it is to costwhere the genius of the place is attended to I am as much delighted as any man with modern  improvementsbut where expence is only considered or mistaken as another name for real taste I feel so much disgust that I turn away my eyes from false ornament to contemplate nature herself in a simple farm unbrokein upon by a Mr Layout  Mr Massem has not only qualified himself to act as a Justice of the peace but has likewise bought a seat in parliamentfrom this latter acquisition to his dignity he will be enabled to do very little good or harm but from the former where some preparation is necessary much mischief may accrue to the neighbourhood if he should prove as I fear will be the case  "a law unto himself"  indeed I am far from wishing to circumscribe  the power of a justice for very few are willing to act as it is without pecuniary advantagesand this I partly attribute to the great encrease of attorniesthese sinful men in the flesh as the Quakers call them have stopped the free course of justice and turned that food which ought to have proved our nourishment and support into a diseaseWhat could be his motive for going into parliament  except the honour on't  I did not foresee but Miss Massem informs me that this will account for his civility in bowing to many of the shabbylooking people that he meets with in the streets of Londonhe may now call them his constituents but I believe in reality  they are no other than his own poor relations  Oh Charles this Miss Massem is I fear a woman of bad principles and though she is particularly kind and attentive to my daughter yet I heartily wish the girl had never been introduced to hershe is artful in her conduct violent in her prejudices and  "made up of passions"  Her friends pretend to excuse her by saying that she cannot curb herself and that she is always the same before every body but I should be apt to add except her brother from whom she has large expectations so that you see the God of Wealth has infinitely more influence over her than the God of Heaven  There is a captain continually with her whom I utterly detest but of him more hereafter  PS Mr Massem has just been with me and told me the price of his seat and I agree with him that he has bought in very dear for the stocks on that exchange are soon likely to fall  All your letters give me pleasure so pray write as often as you can  Your sister joins in all love with your affectionate father  Robert Paulet  Marleston  To Mr Paulet c  Dear Brother  MR Massem's family intend to go to town immediately after Christmas to stay only a very short time and they have been so kind as to offer to take me with them and bear all my expencesthis is a favour that I had no right in the world to expect from them but great as it is I fear I shall not be able to accept it unless you brother will be so good as to throw in your interest with my fatherMiss Massem has lain at him continually but let her say what she will he seems to have no inclination but to mew me up at Marlestonwhenever I urge any thing of the  necessity of my seeing more of the world he always says he does not wish itthat he had much rather see me married to a good man than a great one and I believe he is as likely to meet with the one as the other in this neighbourhood unless he can persuade poor old Dr Snore to make an offer or the ever amiable and charming master Patty Pipkin but perhaps he aspires so high as to think I may marry 'squire Homebrew'd or Parson Poacherif I should be honoured with the first my employment would be I suppose to make tea all day long to settle his stomach and if I take the other I should be constantly engaged in packing up hampers of hares and partridges to send to town to be exchanged by  his correspondents for oysters and brandyMy father seriously I believe means all for my good but I am every day more and more convinced that his not knowing the world will be my greatest misfortune for I am sure Marlestone is not the place if a woman as Miss Massem says is intended to make the most of herself In short brother all my comfort this winter depends upon you for there is nobody else can persuade my father if you can't and you must have a poor opinion indeed of me if you think both my safety and my prudence are at stake because I shall chance to breathe for a week or two the air of London  Let me hope soon to feel the effects of such a letter as you can write if  you please which will ever confer a most lasting obligation on your affectionate sister  Susan Paulet  Marleston  To Miss Paulet c  Dear Sister  BY all the affection I bear you let me entreat you not to urge this London journey too farmy father is convinced that it is absolutely improper or he never would deny you and I think you could not enjoy pleasures abroad that must be purchased with uneasiness at homeperhaps he wishes not to receive such obligations or perhaps he thinks that it will throw you into a mode of life  not calculated to promote your real happinesswhatever are his objections I should think his sentiments should be the rule of your conduct In regard to  "women making the most of themselves"  Miss Massem has borrowed that idea from her brother who has been used in India to make such purchases at a public market and indeed if the plan was as openly avowed here in my mind it would make but very little differencefor what is running from plays to concerts from concerts to routs and from routs to the Pantheon but being equally exposed to sale at a public marketand what is the preparation to it but the vilest prostitution of time reason and tranquilitythe mornings are passed in selecting ornaments  and the conquests of the evening depend on the skill of the hairdresser in adjusting themhow important He is considered can only be known by seeing the disappointment vexation and uneasiness that are occasioned when after two hours waiting the fatal message is brought that he cannot possibly wait on the lady till next dayand what are the conquests after all that are to be made hereof men perhaps chagrined at having lost their last guinea or of fops who have found out a new way to trim their frocks or tye their necklothsalas these men are too much taken up with themselves to be sufficiently attentive to the ladies and the Wise have long since known that where a woman's darling passion  is Vanity the first fruits of marriage can only be a Divorce  I have been obliged to speak out but I make no apology for I am certain that your future welfare depends entirely on your present caution  I am with more sincerity than complaisance  Your most affectionate brother Charles Paulet  Cavendish square  To Mr Paulet c  Dear Father  ALL the diversions I see here contribute to lower my respect for the publicwhether the national capacity is weakened or whether the encreasing numbers of the idle and the vain make it no longer necessary to consult propriety in entertainments I know not but certain I am that the taste of the town is as depraved as its principles  It was a complaint made some years ago that our Operas were disgraced with the lowest insipidity of composition and singsong and that there was nothing to be admired but the mere tricks of the performersthis must always be the case in a nation where a fidler is more estimated  than a composer but now the times are so far altered that neither the fidler nor the music are attended to at allif the eye is pleased the ear and understanding are supposed to be gratified of courseThose who chiefly frequent operas gape out this part of the performance and wake not till they are caught up with raptures at the unmeaning strut of a celebrated Dancer  Translations of that miserable dialogue which were heretofore thought only fit to be set to music are now received at the theatres with the greatest applause under the appellation  Mr Paulet surely forgets the West Indian which is undoubtedly one of the best Comedies in the language Editor  of Comedybewilder only the attention with a quick succession of  incidents and Scotticisms French jargon and Irish blunders in short a Babel of languages are sure to supply all deficiencies of wit and humour  In regard to Tragediesthose that I have seen are merely indebted to the quackery of a manager for their success indeed most of them appear to be made by the same receiptthe ingredients are a tyrant a marriage incest murder and a triumph the poetry once thought essential now seems to make the least part of the productiona scheme is laid between a manager a painter an author and a sceneshifter to fabricate a new piecethe action must be laid in a part of the world that will best suit the scenery of the house for by a little dexterity in the painter the  figure of a Colossus may be easily changed into an Egyptian idolthe next step is to consult the strength of the house in regard to the performersas there are no tolerable men the lady must recite at least half the playthey have an old man that can make a shift to whine out a small part a roaring tyrant and a dm your blood lover and then the sceneshifters may supply the restWhilst the work is perfecting the public is informed by the Newspapers that a gentleman of distinguished abilities now abroad will soon favour the town with a new tragedythe first night of the performance the house is crowded in every corner of it for mankind are not in quest of what is good but of any Hash that they mistake  to be a new onethe curtain rises to soft music the lady makes vows at the altar the tyrant and his trumpets alarm hershe faints and is ordered to be marriedA hermit secretes her from the tyrantdiscovers himself to be her father the lover finds out the hermitage and the second acts ends with their embracesThey must then embrace no morehe is her brothershe flies from him to an altar or a tomb this makes variety in the puppetshowthe tyrant sees her and would absolutely bear her off but she is rescued by her brotherIn the fourth act her brother is seized by the tyrant's guardsis imprisonedshe visits himthe guards drag her from her brother to the tyranthe then resolves  instantly to marry hershe screams and the hermit bursts in and promises to make an important discovery if he will only delay the nuptialsthe tyrant still persistshis guards seize the hermitshe rages prays and goes madthe noise encreases and the theatre is drowned with tearsExpectation is now big for the fifth actwhat a scene of distressshe is absolutely forced to the altar but there rather than marry the tyrant the murderer of her race she recovers her senses and murders him herselfthe guards take no notice of the matter and the house applauds her for near a quarter of an hourthe hermit then declares that her lover is not her brother but a young prince whom he has educated and  therefore with great piety gives his blessing on their nuptialsall then is joy and exultationand thus agreeable to all the rules of Tragedy ends this miserable happy catastropheSome half dozen in the theatre perhaps may be rather discontented but to keep them in humour a favourite actress takes off their attention from the play by giving them the news of the town by way of epilogue  This may not be the exact drama but  Sethona  which I have just now seen is if possible much more ridiculous and inconsistent  I am ever c Charles Paulet  PS The author of Sethona has sacrificed his own better judgment in compliance with the taste of the townhis tragedy of Zingis has infinite merit and his History of Hindostan intitles him to a high rank amongst the learned and ingenious  To Mr Paulet c  Dear Brother  MR Massem's family have been some time in town and I begin to think it full as well that I am left behind however I shall always submit my solicitudes to the prudence of my friendsMy father has been very kind in paying off all my expences on my Derbyshire tour though Mr Massem was very much against it and he says that as soon as ever he thinks it expedient he will give me leave to take another journeydo not think ill of me for the over anxiety I have shown about this but rather view me with an eye of  pity for though I share the caution of a father and the affection of a brother yet deprived of a mother's peculiar watchfulness and care what am I but a poor unsheltered bark exposed to every gale  I am in all sincerity your affectionate sister Susan Paulet  Marleston  To Mr Paulet c  Dear Charles  ACCORDING to your desire I shall now endeavour to point out to you some  Minutiae  as they are called which may serve as proper hints before you go into Holy OrdersMinutiae which not being sufficiently attended to always confirm me in the opinion that a minister is either ignorant of or indifferent to the service he is to performBy the Rubrick before the Common Prayer of the d of Edw VI it was ordered that the priest being in the quire that is in his own seat there should begin with the Lord's Prayer but early in the reign of queen Elizabeth  reading desks were set up in the body of the church and then the Sentences Exhortation Confession and Absolution were generally introduced  Vide Burn's Eccles Law  in regard to the Sentences I shall only observe that any of them are proper but if you begin with  "If we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us but if we confess our sins He c"  you must here supply the word  God  for  He  has no reference The exhortation which must be read with dignity and earnestness should close I think at  "heavenly Grace"  and the words  "saying after me"  should be pronounced as you are kneeling downThe absolution  should not be given as I have frequently heard it as if the minister had power to forgive sins but the voice must be carefully kept up till you come to  "He pardoneth and forgiveth" c  The Venite which must now be considered as another exhortation was formerly used to hasten people into church and Durandus I think mentions that some lazy Christians had always used to lie in bed till they heard the Venite sungThe Psalms  In point of composition the th Psalm is a finer ode than any in Horace  When Israel came out of Egypt and the house of Jacob from among strange people  Judah was his sanctuary and Israel his dominion  The sea saw that and fled Jordan was driven back  The mountains skipped like rams and the little hills like young sheep  What aileth thee O thou sea that thou fleddest and thou Jordan that thou wast driven back  Ye mountains that ye skipped like rams and ye little hills like young sheep  Tremble thou earth at the presence of the Lord at the presence of the God of Jacob  The following verse  "Who turned the hard rock into a standing water and the flintstone into a springing well"  in the Translation is an instance of the Bathos and I could  there  wish to have it omitted What a subject is this Psalm for setting to music if Boyce Howard or some other great composer was to undertake it  have been objected to  by many as being composed for particular occasions and not general enough in their use but they contain such energy such simplicity and elegance that the finest fervour of devotion must be borrowed from themthe stops you know are calculated for the chaunt and much absurdity  will arise if you do not minutely consider the sense and keep up your voice at the end of those verses where the sentence is not completenor is this allthe manner must be particularly attended toa penitential Psalm should be read very differently from that of an exultationin regard to the lessons there is a still greater scopethe manner of reading them should be as various as the matter for what can be more opposite than the commands of Pharaoh and the supplication of Judahthis is scarce ever attended to for most divines I am sorry to say read even the threatnings of Goliah with the meek voice of Davidthe New Testament demands that in the gospel you should plainly recite a  narrativein the fifteenth of Corinthians that you should triumph in your redemptionIn the Belief I confess that I am much hurt that most congregations should bow at the name of Jesus and not at that of God the Fatherthisif it has any meaning exalts the Son above the Father which is unnecessary in a Protestant countrybut the custom has crept in from taking a text in St Paul in the literal sense  "at the name of Jesus every knee shall bow" c  Then follow the Collectsand here I must particularly take notice of that on Advent Sunday which I hope you can repeat with the propriety it deserveswhen you come to that passage  "that at the last day when He shall come again in his  glorious Majesty" c  your own feelings will prompt you to throw in a suitable degree of solemnityweigh the whole of it I entreat you for it is one of the finest models of petitionary compositionWhen the Order for Morning and Evening Service began with the Lord's Prayer it ended with the third Collect for Gracethe Litany was then a separate service and I could almost wish that it had either remained so or that more prayers were omitted on those days that it is appointed to be readthe recital of it however requires particular attentionoh how frequently has it offended both my ear and understanding when a minister has made a full stop at  "all uncharitableness"  as if he had no need to be  delivered from it"In regard to the Communion Service I shall at present only observe that you should not give the Commandments from the altarthis is making the old law of more weight than the newthe code to be amended more sacred than the law explainedin short if it must be read at all it should be read at the beginning not at the end but I need not inform you that this likewise was originally a separate service These are the chief remarks which immediately occur and which being weighed may add propriety to the fervency of your devotionthe subject will improve upon you by attention for though I am not so zealous as some divines who assert that our service is perfect in the beauty of holiness yet  I am fully convinced that upon the whole it is a reasonable and a holy service  Controversy about the Trinity in my opinion is a disease that wants quiet rather than cureas to the Articles the divines must give up a few to save the restthey urge that such tests are necessary to keep out Arians Socinians  Evansonians  cwhy should they be kept out In the name of God I say let them all come in and be made here as I hope they will be hereafter one fold under one shepherd  In regard to sermons let me ask you the following questionshave you studied Dr Jeremy Taylor for matter and not for style have you read Dr Clarke for fine arguments and nice distinctionsSherlock for strength and persuasion  "Ask the sinner then whether the fears of futurity are all idle dreams And as you like his answer follow his example"  Sherlock's th Discourse th vol    and Jortin for plain reason and sober sensehave you felt the sublimity of Warburton  "Those specific attributes from which we deduce all our knowledge of the nature and will of God are formed on analogy and bear relation to ourselves But then we say such attributes are not on that account the less real or essential The light of the sun is not in the orb itself what we see it in the rainbow There it is one candid uniform perfect blaze of glory here we separate its perfection in the various attributes of red yellow blue purple and what else the subtile optician so nicely distinguishes But still the solar light is not less real in the rainbow where its rays become thus untwisted and each differing thread distinctly seen than while they remain united and incorporated with one another in the sun Just so it is with the divine nature it is one simple individual perfection in the Godhead himself but when refracted and divaricated in passing through the human mind it becomes power justice mercy which are all separately and adequately represented to the understanding"  Warburton's d Serm st vol  and admired the concise  elegance of HurdYou can answer I hope all these questions in the affirmativelet me then advise you to buy all the sermons that Manwaring has ever publishedwould his pamphlets were folios but for more common use attend tostudy Bourdalonethe length of your discourses should not exceed twenty minutes few hearers can keep up their attention so long but should you be dull heavy uninstructive nay I will say unentertaining half that time will be estimated an houra good sermon delivered with propriety and earnestness always attractseven the infidel keeps his snuffbox in his pocket and the ladies are silent about their fans but once lose their attention the whole air distils the dews of Morpheus  the 'prentice recollects his Saturday's fatigue and his mistress is forced to pinch her husband to prevent a snorein short though I hate both I think volatile essence is a better ingredient in a sermon than a downright opiateBut what subjects must you choose for discourseshere I should hesitateby no means introduce partynever preach  at  any body this is the fruit of private resentment not of Christian zealdon't pretend to expound very difficult textsexpositions of this kind become the press better than the pulpitsuch disquisitions should be read not heardaddress the senses and the heartquote not chapter and verse but give the substance and if you could the manner of St Paul for I am convinced  that he preached not likeorbut like Hinchliffe Porteus or Hurdnow and then take subjects from the Bible but most frequently from the New Testament a good comment on any sentence in our Saviour's sermon on the mount is of itself a full discourse but you may make excursionsI have read excellent discourses against gaming and very lately a most useful sermon against inhumanity to brutes But where are you to preachby no means for a constancy in a village where your principal auditors will be only a few overgrown farmers  It is well Mr Paulet has confined himself to the overgrown ones for I humbly conceive that the middling farmers like the middle ranks of people were the most attentive as well as the most intelligent of his audience Editor  it  is scarce possible to do much good amongst themthey will not regard you for your reasoning but for your revenue and I declare I would almost as willingly see you transported to live amongst the New Zealanders as after the education I have given you that you should fall at last a dupe to gross ignorance and low conceitthe soldier is brave and the sailor is generousthe mechanic in the course of his traffic has had opportunities of enlarging his ideas but the farmer having never burst the web thinks himself as wise as the parish clerk who is convinced of his own omniscience because he has never met with any one but the parson to tell him the contraryI allow that I speak here with some degree of acrimony  but I am clearly convinced that these men have greatly augmented the distresses of the inferior clergy and it is chiefly owing to them in conjunction with attornies that there is so much  "leading into captivity and such complaining in our streets"  These are the only men about us my dear Charles who have shown neither gratitude nor affection to the memory of poor Mr Arlington yet are ready on every occasion to bow the knee most servilely to the NabobThis brings on melancholy reflections adieu for the present and believe me ever  your affectionate father Robert Paulet  Marleston  PS Let me give you one more caution in regard to sermonsnever introduce any thing ludicrous in themit may be called preaching in the manner of South or Sterne but it is a bad manner and I pray you avoid itAtterbury has frequently disgusted me beyond measure with vulgar allusions and even the bishop of Gloucester when he talks of Hocus Pocus tricks in a sermon on the resurrection  To the Rev Mr Paulet  Dear Father  I Cannot forbear sending you my earliest acknowledgements for your kind remarksI will give them at least all the attention they deserve  I have not only seen your neighbour Mr Massem but have heard him speak in the house of commons on the booksellers petitionhe enlarged on the  nearness  and  dearness  of property in general  "that it was for that only that men had been enabled to risque every thing that was valuable to them in this lifethat he thought authors were a very pernicious race of men that they caused all that abuse on men of property that  appeared so frequently in the newspapers and that the booksellers were a pack of bloodhounds that set them on that he therefore hoped neither of them would have any relief under  this here  billthat he thoroughly understood this particular kind of property he had weighed it and viewed it in every light and was fully convinced that the whole was merely a dispute between the statute law and the common law of the land for his own part therefore he should always be for the former"  He spoke long and with great confidence and was much better heard on the subject of  property  than either a Burke or a Barré would have been had the  weight  and  circulation  of it been materially engaged against them  I write with a rapid pen which you must excuse c  I am your dutiful and affectionate son Charles Paulet  To Mr Paulet  Dear Charles  I Was in hopes to have found more Remarks of Mr Arlington's on Gardening c than I am at present able to send youhe evidently intended to have said more on Architecture which is absolutely necessary likewise to be thoroughly understood by the complete Master of modern Design  From these papers you will see what notions the ancients held of  gardening in general but should you ever wish to dive into further particulars I will shew you a most curious book on that subject which I have by me the title of it is  Stengel de Horto  mine is the second edition printed in There are a thousand different receipts to make paradises and his account of the gardens in Italy will much divert you indeed I suspect that the Italian gardens are not much improved since the days of  Phflaumeren  In regard to the French gardens you may look over a book entitled  Voyage Pittoresque des Environs des Paris par M D  He begins as you would suppose a Frenchman to begin with saying  "Ce n'est point un paradoxe d'avancer que les plus beaux jardins de l'Europe  sont ceux de France"  I was surprised to find in Maundrell's Travels that there was so much genuine taste amongst the Turks  Since lord Kamis and Mr Shenstone published their Remarks there has appeared a little Essay on Design in Gardening by a gentleman of the Temple and an octavo volume of Observations written by Mr Whley both of them books of merit but the latter I think is too full of technical terms for a novice to engage in  Mr Arlington differs in opinion from Mr Mason in regard to avenuesthis is combating great authority but if I was to decide I should be so oldfashioned as to give my verdict against the poet But  you will say what is all this to me who perhaps may never have ten acres of ground in my possession or ever cultivate any thing better than potatoes or cabbagesthis may be very true but I would be equally able to feel and to make proper remarks and to exclaim in the words of Goldsmith that lawns lakes towns fields and woods  " For me their tributary stores combine  " Creation's heir the world the world is mine"  I am your ever affectionate father Robert Paulet  Marleston  March  STRICTURES ON LANDSCAPE GARDENING From Mr ARLINGTON's Papers  Longinus  GARDENING says an ingenious author  Lord Kamis  was at first an useful art"but Eden  Sir Wm Temple  was calculated for pleasure and a life of labour succeeded not till after the fall  "In modern language the garden of Alcinous might be but a kitchengarden"  yet as Eustathius observes  "ornaments was sought for even there however unsuccessfully"  unless we suppose the description given by Homer  to be  "wholly poetical and made at the pleasure of the painter like the little island of Phaeacia"  It would not be of much importance to enquire whether the gardens of Babylon were brought into use by Semiramis Syrus or Beluswe find in general that they were terraces one above the other carried up to the height of the wall of the city and planted with stately trees in imitation of the hanging woods which Amyite had been accustomed to in the mountainous parts of Media  As the gardens of Solomon were chiefly calculated for magnificence and those of the Hesperides celebrated for the excellence of their fruit only I shall venture to suppose the dawn of taste to rise with the old Bard in his description of Calypso's bower  Without the grot a various sylvan scene  Appear'd around and groves of living green  Poplars and alders ever quiv'ring play'd  And nodding cypress form'd a fragrant shade  Four limpid fountains from the clifts distil  And every fountain pours a sev'ral rill  In mazy windings wand'ring down the hill  Where bloomy meads with vivid greens were crown'd  And glowing violets threw odours round  A scene where if a god should cast his sight  A god might gaze and wonder with delight  Pope's Odyssey  It is not improbable says Sir William Temple but that the most refined pleasures of invention descended earlier into Lower Asia from Damascus and Assyriabut as these nations abounded not with heroes the poets make little or no mention of them  It has been supposed that Epicurus was the first who introduced gardens into Greecebut Pliny assures us he was only the first who had a garden within the city of Athens whereas before his time they were without the walls like the  Horti Suburbani  of the Romans  In such retreats this great philosopher gave the most shining precepts of morality however misrepresented by the Stoics or mistaken by those gross pretenders to his sect who conceived pleasure to consist only in sensualitythey served the two purposes of assembling the philosopher's pupils for instruction and of furnishing them as Cowley well expresses it  "with cheap and virtuous luxury"  Nor was this luxury confined merely to the philosophersthe greatest warriours sought for hours of reflection in such retirements and the same hands were employed in the service of agriculture which had raised and supported the glory of their country  Though utility was chiefly sought for in the gardens of the philosophers yet Virgil's Description of the Elysian Fields affords a most beautiful specimen of bold imagery and rich design  "The full green of the woodsthe gayly illuminated lawn the grove with the rapid river issuing from it the dusky thickets the fresh meads watered with rills the sequestered vale rendered more solemn by the thick wood and placid stream"  His account likewise of the old Corycians gardens makes us greatly lament that haste should have deprived the world of his masterly instructions on a subject he so much admiredFather Harduin indeed in his Notes on Pliny thinks the loss is amply made up to us by his brother Jesuit's Poem on Gardening which  he puts in competition with the Georgicsan opinion which will be adopted by such critics as feel no difference between the feeble descriptions ofand the glowing pictures of a  Mason    In England we have ever till of late most servilely copied our methods of gardening from the Italians French Flemish or Dutch all of whom indeed seem to have offered nothing better in the construction of them than  "clipt hedges parterres squirting fountains truelove knots and flourishes"  Sir William Temple seems much delighted with the taste brought in by king William of which the evergreen quarter at Kensington remains a specimen and offers Moore Park in Hertfordshire as the perfectest  figure of a garden he ever sawindeed he allows there may be other forms admitted wholly irregular but they must owe their beauty to some extraordinary dispositions of nature  Lord Bacon does not like images cut out in juniper or other gardenstuff  "they be for children" says he"but can approve of little low hedges cut round like welts with some pretty pyramidsand in some places fair columns upon frames of carpenter's work"  Mr Pope severely ridicules the invasion of nature but proposes a place to be copied from which in his time partook largely of the old absurdities  A full detail of them may be found in Monsr de Phflaumeren c  and whose beauties were but  trifling and puerile  Stowe  when compared with Versailles might demand some share of admiration but immense would be the distance from that genuine taste which  Shenstone  Vide Letters on Chivalry and Romance  "and nature have brought us acquainted with"  Stowe indeed under its modern improvements may be considered as a very fine specimen of taste and design particularly by those who are unacquainted with the exquisite eleganceI had almost said the absolute perfection of lord Scarsdale's  "It seems to me says lord Kamis far from an exaggeration that good professors are not more essential to a college than a spacious garden which  ought to be tempered with simplicity rejecting sumptuous and glaring ornamentsin this respect the university of Oxford may be deemed a perfect model"  That the gardens of Oxford may be as useful and efficacious as those of ancient Rome for the purposes of study and application I will by no means presume to denybut they are certainly as artful as their buildingsthey are formal without unity of design and complex without variety  "Regularity" says the same author "is required in that part of a garden which joins the dwellinghouse"  The beauties of a dwellinghouse arise from regularity and proportion but the works of art and nature have a different destination  utility would suffer if the ground was not polished near the dwelling but this polish to speak philosophically should be I think inversely as the distance  Mr Burke doubts  "whether beauty be at all an idea belonging to proportion"  surely the effect produced by it in architecture strikes even a common eye with pleasurethe instance produced from vegetables is not much to the purpose for it will appear from an accurate survey that there is more regularity in the parts of flowers than is commonly imaginedtheir forms indeed are infinitely varied but in the same plant nature seldom deviates from the laws of proportion and some of our best botanists have actually founded much  of their systems upon the proportion of the partsso far therefore from supposing no beauty to result from proportion we may infer that some part at least of the beauty even of vegetables arises from it  It is supposed by modern rules that all avenues of course must be cut down but I am far from thinking that they may not frequently remain to great advantagethey must be long and wide and should properly lead to a Gothic castle tower or any other large and ancient buildingI know it has been said  Vide Essay on Sublime and Beautiful  "that avenues of a moderate length are far grander and that a true artist should always put a generous deceit on the  spectator"  but though perspective will lessen greatness in height as it gains in length  Burke  " yet I think it is equally certain that the duke of Montagu's avenues will be considered as far more grand than those in St James's Park  To remedy the ill effects of a straight line an uniform curve is now adoptedbut alteration is not always improvementand it reminds me of the conduct of the matron who to prevent her daughter from dropping her chin into her bosom threw it up into the air by the aid of a steel collarHogarth's Analysis has as yet been read to very little purpose  "Grandeur may possibly be enforced by surprize  Shenstone  "  but propriety  will suffer for ita magnificent building will certainly appear more magnificent after viewing a cottagebut where is the connection between a dairy and a Chinese temple a rustic seat and a Grecian altar  We rarely see the whole of a building with its furniture confined to one expressionsome minute article is for ever giving us disgustwe view an hermitage for instancefrom the gloomy entrance into itthe crucifix and other emblems placed in orderthe strawbed and old seatwe are so struck with the solemnity of the scene that we are even in expectation of seeing the saint himself approach to meet ustill all of a sudden a modern dining table presents itself to view and at once destroys all our enthusiasm  How different this from the taste of him who thought of only putting a few rude planks together and carving the signs of the zodiac upon them  * * * * * * * *  * * * * * * * *  * * * * * * * *  * * * * * * * *  Elevations of the different parts of Blenheimhouse when viewed separately on paper are not unworthy of the greatest architectbut when taken together the whole appears as a most heavy pile of buildingthere is no contrast no relief though Mr Pope perhaps made too severe a remark when he called it  "a quarry of stones above ground"  Many of our modern houses have been built from Italian models without the least reference or conformity to the change of countryon account of heat in Italy it is necessary to have but few windowsthis must ever make a building not only appear heavy but of course produce a contrary effect to that which ought to be sought for in a northern clime  It was not always a specimen of bad taste in our ancestors that they built their houses in a valley and moated them round aboutsafety in those times was principally to be consideredand improvements in mechanics had not then enabled them to live with equal convenience above hill as below  The common opinion at present is that a house cannot have too much prospect but I would carefully distinguish between looking at and overlooking objectsthe summit may be very proper for an observatory but not always for a dwellinghouse from which all objects I think should be seen distinctly without the aid of a telescope  * * * * * * * *  "A garden on a flat  Lord Kaims  it is said ought to be highly and  The ornaments must be very carefully suited for to dress up trifling subjects in grand and exalted expressions will in the end only make them appear the more contemptible  variously ornamented in order to occupy the mind and prevent its regretting the insipidity of a uniform plainartificial  mounts in this view are commonbut no person has thought of an artificial walk elevated high above the plain"  The effect of such a walk is most admirably exemplified in Mr Garrick's  But I cannot approve of the statue of Shakespearesurely it would have been time enough to have represented him in marble or stone when the very Genius of Shakespeare no longer presided there  polished ground at Hampton  There will always be a material difference where the master himself is possessed of a fine taste when compared with that of any hirelinghe will more cooperate with naturehe has a better opportunity of becoming intimately acquainted with the Genius of his own placea difference not to be explained on paper perhaps but strongly to be felt at the  Mr Shenstone's  Leasowesat  Mr Hamilton's  Cobhamat  Sir R Newdigate's  Arboryand  Lord Scardale's  Kedleston  No wonder that our taste in England is still to be condemned since most of ur largest gardens are laid out by some general undertaker who regardless of the peculiar beauties of each situation introduces the same objects at the same distances in all  "Art should ever be timid of overstepping the modesty of nature for any thing overdone is from the purpose and though it may make the unskilful admire cannot but make the judicious grievethe censure of which one as Shakespeare observes to the actors must in your allowance  youtweigh a whole theatre of others"  Gardening then in its highest stage of improvement is of the nature of an epic poemthe plan must be great entire and one  Dryden  "Even the least portions must have a reference to the wholeNothing of a foreign nature like the trifling conceits"  which bad poets or bad gardeners  "are always ready to introduce By which the observer is misled into another sort of pleasure opposite to that which is designed in the general plan One conduces to the designer's aim the completing of his workthe other slackens his pace diverts him from his way and locks him up like a knighterrant in an enchanted castle  when he should be pursuing his main adventure"  In short as Pope says  To build to plant whatever you intend  To rear the column or the arch to bend  To swell the terras or to sink the grot  In all let nature never be forgot  Still follow sense of every art the soul  Parts answ'ring parts shall slide into a whole  To the Rev Mr Paulet  Dear Father  I Have of late forborne to give you any account of my pupil as I could not give you a very favourable onehe is permitted by his uncle to sit up so late overnight that he is generally unfit for business all the next dayA circumstance has lately happened that has given me much uneasiness though I believe I had more reason to be concerned for his principles than his safetya dispute arose the other evening at cards I suspect and words ran so high that it was at length agreed to decide the important matter by single combatthe heroes met in form at the appointed timetheir  pistols missed fire and the seconds interposedand there it endedthis however with the initials of their namesin couched termswith distant observationsand short inuendoes makes out a very pompous paragraph for the newspapersI have often in my own mind attributed the great encrease of duelling to the accounts that are there insertedof this I am certain it is one cause at least if not a principal one but duelling will always be practised in every country  "where the dread of shame is greater than the love of glory"  for instance now we read that  "a great dispute happened the other day at a certain great assembly" the Robinhood perhaps or the Sixpenny Pantheon "which was  determined to be decided by single combaton the day appointed Mr A met captain B Mr D was second to Mr A and captain G was second to captain B Mr A received the first fire and asked captain B if he would then ask pardon who roughly answeredno his honour forbad himthen said Mr A I must fire though it will give me the most inexpressible concern to rob the public of so gallant and so respectable a characteron which he presented his pistol pulled the trigger and the ball grazed captain B's shoulderknot who instantly fell to the groundthe seconds interposed and Mr A called to a surgeon who stood at a small distance to assist captain B  who was immediately carried home in a chair"  Then comes  "We hear that the amiable Miss C was so alarmed at captain B's danger" she did not know we presume at what distance they were to fire "that she lay in fits the whole day and her life is even now despaired ofcaptain B's misery on this occasion is easier to be conceived than expressed but he was conscious that a man destitute of honour must be totally unworthy of Miss C's love"  Let your barber only read all this and he sleeps not

Rev Mr Paulet  Dear Father  MY situation is every day more and more disagreeable to memy pupil has formed connections that will ruin his peace and destroy my satisfactionhis fortune is come too soon and there are vulturs that already make a prey of himhis uncle says he disapproves of Gaming but is for ever speaking respectfully of the most abandoned characters of the times and the young man is taught in the world that to discharge any debts but those of honour is mechanicalto regard money is below a man of rank when so many men without any can cut so great a figure  it is not I find till men have played deep that they know the resourcesthen they can borrow money and get great names to be bound with them if one does not pay another mustbut if none canthey must bilk their creditors by going abroad unless some lady of great fortune will in the mean time make herself happy by marrying a man of fashion and of the worldThis year then the whole set are again established they contract new debts and find out new fools to become security for the payment of themWhilst our nobility and gentry are thus squandering away their estates what wonder is it that negociators and attorneys are purchasing all the principal seats about Londontheir incomes are made great by  annuities and their principal is established by premiumsthese usurers if they have not the impudence to take seats in parliament themselves can nevertheless carry on the sale of boroughs for their dependents and young men thus seduced are generally compelled to barter their dearest interests to gain petty places in the excise perhaps at the foot of the treasuryboard that they may satisfy the rapacious demands of an usurer's clerkInterest in the House arises from connections at Arthur's and popularity is gained

slavish subjection to the tyranny of fashion and will soon be irrevocably plunged into the deep and desperate gulph of gaminglast night however he gave me at least a serious hearing but informed me that it was utterly impossible that I should know any thing of life or of the world  "Gaming" says he "is as necessary a qualification for a young man of fashion as dress dancing fencing or a knowledge of modern languagesit is practised universally abroad and play here at a high stake is not only an introduction but become the only key of admittance into most of the best companieshow would Sir John Rouleau have ever got a seat in parliament if he  had not made a good acquaintance at Arthur's or Newmarketthese are the only schools of advancement and those fortunes" says he "which you call lost are only transferred for a night or two into other handsbesides if they never return the Great can easily make other compensations and where is the difference between receiving a large income from a place or from dirty farms except that the former is here considered as the more honourablethose who value the latter only can never be received into company at all except at countymeetings or raceballs and then they are only admitted like parsons to laugh at bad jokes or dance with ugly partners"  All this may be very true but I am yet to be convinced  that it is necessary to become a man of fashion if the title must be purchased at the expence of peace virtue honour and religion however no reply can be made to arguments which have no  "weak side"  of reason to be attacked upon but of this I am certain that such principles every day encrease in the kingdom and in a short time I fear will overwhelm it  From this curs'd fount what mighty evils flow

Charles  I Shoot this letter at randomif you have left town for Bath it will only for a while delay some uneasinessGlanville I had been informed  had taken such liberties with your sister that I was determined to intercept a letter which I supposed to have come from himit proved to be the enclosed which I send for your perusal in the mean time I have made no other comment but to forbid my daughter from ever having any more connections with  that  familyYou will see the use that is made of Lord Chesterfield's Letters which I have readhis mind poor man was a fine flowergarden overrun with weedsbut he is deadMr Stanhope is likewise deadthey are both deadto meditate on Death is to pass the severest censure on those epistleshad he reflected on Death as frequently as on the  "Graces"

MarlestonHall  Sunday Morn  My dear Susy  AFTER you left us last night you cannot think how captain Glanville laughed at your notions of everlasting constancy and that if once you had given your affections you was sure they could never be alienateddo you know that he swears no woman's affections ever yet served a regular apprenticeship and that you have arts and graces enough to make  any man wind about and serpentine just as you pleaseAproposyou must read Lord Chesterfield's Letters which I will send youhis advice to his son in regard to the world will hold exactly right as to any woman's management of a husbandhe says very justly  "that because man is a rational animal you must not suppose therefore that he always acts rationally you must watch his weak unguarded moments get into his secrets engage his heart and you will easily  dupe  his understanding"  Dissimulation is the virtue of the Great and as you will see from these excellent books the men not only practise it but profess it as a science how then shall we be able to cope with them if we do not fight with as good  weapons and play off their own arts against themselvesNow for instance suppose you was to marry an old bachelorI think you might overthrow all his little systems in a fortnightto be sure at times he would be restive and cross but then you must suppose he never speaks his real sentiments and at others he will quietly enough return to his shacklesthis is what Mr Pope means by  " If she rules him never shows she rules"  Why should she show it for her time to take advantage is only when alone before company she must always acquiesce or the world will not be of her side and as Lord Chesterfield  says the world is always the  dupe  of deceit and it is therefore much better  to seem  than  to be  "I knew a lady that adopted this mode of conduct exactly and was very successfulto be sure the man was very miserable and at last I believe died of a broken heart but the world to this day are almost

Have now been near a week at Bath with my pupilwe lodge at the new hotel called York house which is very commodiousindeed more so I think than the noble one just fitted  in CoventGarden as there are  more conveniencies under the same roofYou have heard so much of the neatness and regularity of the buildings here that it is unnecessary for me to expatiate upon themthe Circus and south front of the Square are beautiful beyond description but I cannot approve the Crescent though I must confess I never saw any building where so many rules of architecture were violated that altogether looked so wellTo describe the manners and fashions here would be far beyond my art though they have many peculiar to themselvesas in town people quarrel for places and preferments and where some great prize is held up to the aspirants so here for want of better employment they have been absolutely compelled  to quarrel for nothing at allnot whether one man should have more popularity or higher distinction than another but whether he should go up the hill or down to dance his minuet and whether the important place of master of the ceremonies should be filled by a native of Ireland or Englandnay to so great a degree has this fashion of quarrelling for nothing prevailed amongst the fair sex that not content merely with the war of the tongue they have even descended to blowsthis can be attributed to nothing but the extraordinary Fermentation of the waters  The numberless evils to which mankind are always by necessity exposed should make them one would think at all times endeavour to unite in  bands of mutual harmony and here especially where so many are in a perpetual state of sufferingyet here from mere fashion the strangest infatuation prevails even amongst invalids who fly as far as possible from the baths and the shelter of the lower town to brave the turbulency of the mountainsthe buildings are now extended so far that as the Irishman would say  "Bath is run away from itself it is absolutely gone out of its own town"  and it may do very well for the healthful to follow it but sure it is the greatest absurdity in the world that invalids should fly as far as possible from shelter and from all those advantages for which Bath is so peculiarly and so justly celebrated  The waters if you believe the Apothecaries are specifics for all disorders there is only one that you can possibly die of which is Obstinacythis becomes incurable from not taking advice enough about the use of them when present or by removing from the benefit of them too soonit is true lady  Skinandbone  has been coughing up her lungs here these two years but would certainly have recovered had she not  obstinately  refused to stay one fortnight longer and my lord  Lastlegs  would absolutely have relinquished his crutches in a few days more and hung them up in the pumproom as the most memorable trophies in ithad he not  obstinately  resolved to change these ever efficacious waters for those of Bristol  In regard to the diversions there is a playhouse here where the actors exclusive of Garrick are in general full as good as those in townin tragedy they do not always speak with  "a good accent and good discretion"  but I have seen some characters in comedy really supported with great humour and proprietyThe new rooms are elegantly fitted up and may be better calculated perhaps than any others for the purposes of dancing and gaming but as I never partake of the latter and not very frequently of the former they afford me but little or no entertainmentfor an evening or two I might have been delighted with the splendor of the appearance but soon as some one expresses it  " The gay idea palls upon the sense  " And coldly strikes the mind with feeble bliss"  In short if I was obliged to give you my opinion of Bath I should define it to be a place in which though life perhaps may not be passed most usefully it may nevertheless be wasted agreeablyamongst wanton widows and debauched wives  forsaken  Irishmen and  forsaking  men of quality  This place is so fertile of anecdote that I could send you volumes from it instead of epistles  I am ever c c Charles

bearing up against afflictions who have never felt themthere may be such situations that no principles can fortify the mind against and under which the greatest and the best must ever fallinto such a one is your unhappy father plungedI pursued my journey so much faster than I expected for man neither knows his weakness nor his strength that I thought by night I should even reach Dover but gaining no tidings I began to sink under my fatigue and to hope only from time for that aid which philosophy could not afford meAs I was passing through a small village I saw all the people running out with unfeeling  curiosity after a poor wretch who they told me was falling into labourthe officers I found were persecuting her to save expences to the next parish and had refused her not only harbour but reliefno situation can dispense with our humanityI determined therefore to allot some few shillings to succour at least if not to save this victim of distressas I came nearer the rabble stopped and for a while I even forgot my own miseries to contemplate hersI inveighed against their cruelty in the bitterest termsbroke through the crowd and insisted on their affording her some reliefthey told me  "there was no occasion for the woman entreated only for to die"  I demanded that they should convey her to the  next alehousethat I would leave my watchmy moneymy aid to carry her into it alas I was unable to give for she was now from agonies become an object too shocking for humanity to beholdI was at length responsible for her charges and the crowd were indifferent to her distressAs soon as they had borne her in I entreated her to take comfortbewailed her miseriesassured her that if either by leaving my watch or some money I could procure her cordial medicine or assistance I would relieve hershe looked up wistfully in my face and told me she wished me only to forgiveThink my dearest Charles what must be my feelings when I found this object of misery to be no other than my poor unhappy  daughter whom that villain Glanville had thus basely desertedfor a while I fear I was unable to yield that assistance as a father that she would have found from me as a friendbut recovering my tranquillityI assured her that all resentments were lost in her distress that I had even forgot she had offended me and that if she could recover  "Alas says she it is now too late for I have languished whole days from wantwithout friendwithout moneyand without that comfort that innocence could have afforded me"  but that to see me once again was more than her fondest wishes ever formed nor had she another hope than by the blessing of a father to look up for the forgiveness of her God"But here I pause for  the scene became too affecting and I believe I was carried away from her before death put a period to her distressFondly bewailing her untimely fate I sit by her faded corse and shed the tender tribute of unavailing tearsthinking that I still see her only as asleepthat I shall again enjoy the sweets of her converse and that we shall again be happyhappy indeed we may be in another world but never more in thisbut I blush to refer myself only to futurity when on earth I can feel no more comfortOh Charles think not that I mean to vindicate wrong or that my fondness gets the better of my principlesI know her errors but will not with a malicious world think this the only fault that a woman can never  expiateit is not believe me an horror at the crime but the pride of life that begets these distinctions Let the cold the selfish and the unfriendly speak rigidly of her offences a father could feel only for her distressWhen this first burst of my grief begins to subside I shall endeavour to take some measures for her removal for at all adventures I resolve to bury her at Marleston not with those honours perhaps as if adorned with virtue yet nevertheless with a decency that is due to the unfortunate and lest  "ill tongues should hereafter be too busy with her fame"  I will inscribe something like the following epitaph upon her tomb  Stopgentle maidwhoever thou art  She that lies buried here was once  as fair and amiable as Thyself  Whilst she was innocent she was happy  but by yielding to the seduction of Man  and of the Worldshe was cut off in  the early bloom of youth  to deter Thee  from following her  Example  THE END
