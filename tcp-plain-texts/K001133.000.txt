 THE CARPENTER Or the DANGER of EVIL COMPANY  THERE was a young Westcountry man  A Carpenter by trade  A skilful wheelwright too was he  And few such Waggons made  No Man a tighter Barn cou'd build  Throughout his native town  Thro' many a village round was he  The best of workmen known  His father left him what he had  In sooth it was enough  His shining pewter pots of brass  And all his household stuff  A little cottage too he had  For ease and comfort plann'd  And that he might not lack for ought  An acre of good land  A pleasant orchard too there was  Before his cottage door  Of cider and of corn likewise  He had a little store  Active and healthy stout and young  No business wanted he  Now tell me reader if you can  What man more blest cou'd be  To make his comfort quite compleat  He had a faithful Wife  Frugal and neat and good was she  The blessing of his life  Where is the Lord or where the Squire  Had greater cause to praise  The goodness of that bounteous hand  Which blest his prosp'rous days  Each night when he return'd from work  His wife so meek and mild  His little supper gladly dress'd  While he caress'd his child  One blooming babe was all he had  His only darling dear  The object of their equal love  The solace of their care  O what cou'd ruin such a life  And spoil so fair a lot  O what cou'd change so kind a heart  All goodness quite forgot  With grief the cause I must relate  The dismal cause reveal  'Twas EVIL COMPANY and DRINK  The source of every ill  A Cooper came to live hard by  Who did his fancy please  An idle rambling Man was he  Who oft had cross'd the seas  This Man could tell a merry tale  And sing a merry song  And those who heard him sing or talk  Ne'er thought the ev'ning long  But vain and vicious was the song  And wicked was the tale  And every pause he always fill'd  With cider gin or ale  Our Carpenter delighted much  To hear the Cooper talk  And with him to the Alehouse oft  Wou'd take his evening walk  At first he did not care for drink  But only lik'd the  un  But soon he from the Cooper learnt  The same sad course to run  He said the Cooper's company  Was all for which he car'd  But soon he drank as much as he  To swear like him soon dar'd  His hammer now neglected lay  For work he little car'd  Half finish'd wheels and broken tools  Were strew'd about his yard  To get him to attend his work  No prayers cou'd now prevail  His hatchet and his plane forgot  He never drove a Nail  His chearful ev'nings now no more  With peace and plenty smil'd  No more he sought his pleasing Wife  Nor hugg'd his smiling child  For not his drunken nights alone  Were with the Cooper past  His days were at the Angel spent  And still he stay'd the last  No handsome Sunday suit was left  Nor decent holland shirt  No nosegay mark'd the Sabbath day  But all was rags and dirt  No more his Church he did frequent  A symptom ever sad  Where once the Sunday is mispent  The week days must be bad  The cottage mortgag'd for its worth  The favourite orchard sold  He soon began to feel th'effects  Of hunger and of cold  The pewter dishes one by one  Were pawn'd till none was left  And wife and babe at home remain'd  Of every help bereft  By chance he call'd at home one nigh  And in a surly mood  He bade his weeping wife to get  Immediately some food  His empty cupboard well he knew  Must needs be bare of bread  No rasher on the rack he saw  Whence cou'd he then be fed  His wife  See B  rquin's Gardener  a piteous sigh did heave  And then before him laid  A basket cover'd with a cloth  But not a word she said  Then to her husband gave a knife  With many a silent tear  In haste he tore the cover off  And saw his child lay there  "There lies thy babe the mother said  "Oppress'd with famine sore  "O kill us both'twere kinder far  We cou'd not suffer more"  The Carpenter struck to the heart  Fell on his knees straitway  He wrung his handsconfess'd his sins  And did both weep and pray  From that same hour the Cooper more  He never wou'd behold  Nor wou'd he to the Alehouse go  Had it been pav'd with gold  His Wife forgave him all the past  And sooth'd his sorrowing mind  And much he griev'd that e'er he wrong'd  The worthiest of her kind  By lab'ring hard and working late  By industry and pains  His Cottage was at length redeem'd  And sav'd were all his gains  His Sundays now at Church were spent  His home was his delight  The following verse himself he made  And read it every night  The Drunkard Murders Child and Wife  Nor matters it a pin  Whether he stabs them with his knife  Or starves them
