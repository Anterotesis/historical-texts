 VOL I  The Second EDITION  A COLLECTION OF POEMS IN THREE VOLUMES  BY SEVERAL HANDS  LONDON Printed by J HUGHS For R DODSLEY at Tully'sHead in PallMall MDCCXLVIII  ADVERTISEMENT  THE intent of the following Volumes is to preserve to the public those poetical performances which seemed to merit a longer remembrance than what would probably be secured to them by the MANNER wherein they were originally published This design was first suggested to the Editor as it was afterwards conducted by the opinions of some Gentlemen whose names it would do him the highest honour to mention He desires in this place also to make his acknowledgments to the authors of several pieces inserted in these Volumes which were never before in print and which he is persuaded would be thought to add credit to the most judicious collection of this kind in our language He has nothing farther to premise but that the Reader must not expect to be pleased  with every particular poem which is here presented to him It is impossible to furnish out an entertainment of this nature where every part shall be relished by every guest it will be sufficient if nothing is set before him but what has been approved by those of the most acknowledged taste  A POEM To his EXCELLENCY The LORD PRIVYSEAL On the PROSPECT of PEACE  By Mr TICKELL  Sacerdos  Fronde super MITRAM foelici comptus oliva  VIRG  To The LORD PRIVYSEAL  COntending kings and fields of death too long  Have been the subject of the British song  Who hath not read of fam'd Ramillia's plain  Bavaria's fall and Danube choak'd with slain  Exhausted themes A gentler note I raise  And sing returning Peace in softer lays  Their fury quell'd and martial rage allay'd  I wait our heroes in the sylvan shade  Disbanding hosts are imag'd to my mind  And warring pow'rs in friendly leagues combin'd  While ease and pleasure make the nations smile  And heav'n and ANNA bless Britannia's isle  Well sends our Queen her mitred BRISTOL forth  For early counsels fam'd and longtry'd worth  Who thirty rolling years had oft withheld  The Suede and Saxon from the dusty field  Compleatly form'd to heal the Christian wounds  To name the kings and give each kingdom bounds  The face of ravag'd nature to repair  By leagues to soften earth and heav'n by pray'r  To gain by love where rage and slaughter fail  And make the crosier o'er the sword prevail  So when great Moses with JEHOVAH's wand  Had scatter'd plagues o'er stubborn Pharaoh's land  Now spread an host of locusts round the shore  Now turn'd Nile's fatt'ning streams to putrid gore  Plenty and gladness mark'd the priest of God  And sudden almonds shot from Aaron's rod  O thou from whom these bounteous blessings flow  To whom as chief the hopes of peace we owe  For next to thee the man whom kings contend  To stile companion and to make their friend  Great Strafford rich in every courtly grace  With joyful pride accepts the second place  From Britain's isle and Isis' sacred spring  One hour oh listen while the muses sing  Tho' ministers of mighty monarchs wait  With beating hearts to learn their masters' fate  One hour forbear to speak thy Queen's commands  Nor think the world thy charge neglected stands  The blissful prospects in my verse display'd  May lure the stubborn the deceiv'd persuade  Ev'n thou to Peace shalt speedier urge the way  And more be hasten'd by this short delay  A POEM ON THE PROSPECT OF PEACE  THE haughty Gaul in ten campaigns o'erthrown  Now ceas'd to think the western world his own  Oft had he mourn'd his boasting leaders bound  And his proud bulwarks smoaking on the ground  In vain with pow'rs renew'd he fill'd the plain  Made tim'rous vows and brib'd the saints in vain  As oft his legions did the fight decline  Lurk'd in the trench and sculk'd behind the line  Before his eyes the fancy'd javelin gleams  At feasts he starts and seems dethron'd in dreams  On glory past reflects with secret pain  On mines exhausted and on millions slain  To Britain's Queen the scepter'd suppliant bends  To her his crowns and infant race commends  Who grieves her fame with christian blood to buy  Nor asks for glory at a price so high  At her decree the war suspended stands  And Britain's heroes hold their lifted hands  Their open brows no threat'ning frowns disguise  But gentler passions sparkle in their eyes  The Gauls who never in their courts could find  Such temper'd fire with manly beauty join'd  Doubt if they're those whom dreadful to the view  In forms so fierce their fearful fancies drew  At whose dire names ten thousand widows press'd  Their helpless orphans clinging to the breast  In silent rapture each his foe surveys  They vow firm friendship and give mutual praise  Brave minds howe'er at war are secret friends  Their gen'rous discord with the battle ends  In peace they wonder whence dissention rose  And ask how souls so like could e'er be foes  Methinks I hear more friendly shouts rebound  And social clarions mix their sprightly sound  The British flags are furl'd her troops disband  And scatter'd armies seek their native land  The hardy veteran proud of many a scar  The manly charms and honours of the war  Who hop'd to share his friends' illustrious doom  And in the battle find a soldier's tomb  Leans on his spear to take his farewel view  And sighing bids the glorious camp adieu  Ye generous fair receive the brave with smiles  O'erpay their sleepless nights and crown their toils  Soft beauty is the gallant soldier's due  For you they conquer and they bleed for you  In vain proud Gaul with boastful Spain conspires  When English valour English beauty fires  The nations dread your eyes and kings despair  Of chiefs so brave till they have nymphs so fair  See the fond wife in tears of transport drown'd  Hugs her rough lord and weeps o'er ev'ry wound  Hangs on the lips that fields of blood relate  And smiles or trembles at his various fate  Near the full bowl he draws the fancied line  And marks feign'd trenches in the flowing wine  Then sets th' invested fort before her eyes  And mines that whirl'd battalions to the skies  His little list'ning progeny turn pale  And beg again to hear the dreadful tale  Such dire atchievements sings the bard that tells  Of palfrey'd dames bold knights and magick spells  Where whole brigades one champion's arms o'erthrow  And cleave a giant at a random blow  Slay paynims vile that force the fair and tame  The goblin's fury and the dragon's flame  Our eager youth to distant nations run  To visit fields their valiant fathers won  From Flandria's shore their country's fame they trace  Till far Germania shews her blasted face  Th' exulting Briton asks his mournful guide  Where his hard fate the lost Bavaria try'd  Where Stepney grav'd the stone to ANNA's fame  He points to Blenheim once a vulgar name  Here fled the Houshold there did Tallard yield  Here Marlb'rough turn'd the fortune of the field  On those steep banks near Danube's raging flood  The Gauls thrice started back and trembling stood  When Churchill's arm perceiv'd they stood not long  But plung'd amidst the waves a desp'rate throng  Crowds whelm'd on crowds dash'd wide the watry bed  And drove the current to its distant head  As when by Raphael's or by Kneller's hands  A warlike courser on the canvas stands  Such as on Landen bleeding Ormond bore  Or set young Ammon on the Granic shore  If chance a gen'rous steed the work behold  He snorts he neighs he champs the foamy gold  So Hocstet seen tumultuous passions roll  And hints of glory fire the Briton's soul  In fancy'd fights he sees the troops engage  And all the tempest of the battle rage  Charm me ye pow'rs with scenes less nobly bright  Far humbler thoughts th' inglorious muse delight  Content to see the horrors of the field  By ploughshares level'd or in flow'rs conceal'd  O'er shatter'd walls may creeping ivy twine  And grass luxuriant cloath the harmless mine  Tame flocks ascend the breach without a wound  Or crop the bastion now a fruitful ground  While shepherds sleep along the rampart laid  Or pipe beneath the formidable shade  Who was the man Oblivion blast his name  Torn out and blotted from the list of fame  Who fond of lawless rule and proudly brave  First sunk the filial subject to a slave  His neighbour's realms by frauds unkingly gain'd  In guiltless blood the sacred ermine stain'd  Laid schemes for death to slaughter turn'd his heart  And fitted murder to the rules of art  Ah curs'd ambition to thy lures we owe  All the great ills that mortals bear below  Curs'd by the hind when to the spoil he yields  His year's whole sweat and vainlyripen'd fields  Curs'd by the maid torn from her lover's side  When lest a widow though not yet a bride  By mothers curs'd when floods of tears they shed  And scatter useless roses on the dead  Oh sacred Bristol then what dangers prove  The arts thou smil'st on with paternal love  Then mix'd with rubbish by the brutal foes  In vain the marble breathes the canvas glows  To shades obscure the glitt'ring sword pursues  The gentle poet and defenceless muse  A voice like thine alone might then asswage  The warrior's fury and controul his rage  To hear thee speak might the fierce Vandal stand  And fling the brandish'd sabre from his hand  Far hence be driv'n to Scythia's stormy shore  The drum's harsh musick and the cannon's roar  Let grim Bellona haunt the lawless plain  Where Tartar clans and grisly Cossacks reign  Let the steel'd Turk be deaf to matrons' cries  See virgins ravish'd with relentless eyes  To death grey heads and smiling infants doom  Nor spare the promise of the pregnant womb  O'er wasted kingdoms spread his wide command  The savage lord of an unpeopled land  Her guiltless glory just Britannia draws  From pure religion and impartial laws  To Europe's wounds a mother's aid she brings  And holds in equal scales the rival kings  Her gen'rous sons in choicest gifts abound  Alike in arms alike in arts renown'd  As when sweet Venus so the fable sings  Awak'd by Nereids from the Ocean springs  With smiles she sees the threat'ning billows rise  Spreads smooth the surge and clears the louring skies  Light o'er the deep with flutt'ring Cupids crown'd  The pearly couch and silver turtles bound  Her tresses shed ambrosial odours round  Amidst the world of waves so stands serene  Britannia's isle the Ocean's stately queen  In vain the nations have conspir'd her fall  Her trench the sea and fleets her floating wall  Defenceless barks her pow'rful navy near  Have only waves and hurricanes to fear  What bold invader or what land oppress'd  Hath not her anger quell'd her aid redress'd  Say where have e'er her unioncrosses sail'd  But much her arms her justice more prevail'd  Her labours are to plead th' Almighty's cause  Her pride to teach th' untam'd barbarian laws  Who conquers wins by brutal strength the prize  But 'tis a godlike work to civilize  Have we forgot how from great Russia's throne  The king whose pow'r half Europe's regions own  Whose scepter waving with one shout rush forth  In swarms the harness'd millions of the north  Through realms of ice pursu'd his tedious way  To court our friendship and our fame survey  Hence the rich prize of useful arts he bore  And round his empire spread the learned store  T' adorn old realms is more than new to raise  His country's parent is a monarch's praise  His bands now march in just array to war  And Caspian gulphs unusual navies bear  With Runic lays Smolensko's forests ring  And wond'ring Volga hears the muses sing  Did not the painted kings of India greet  Our Queen and lay their scepters at her feet  Chiefs who full bowls of hostile blood had quaff'd  Fam'd for the javelin and invenom'd shaft  Whose haughty brows made savages adore  Nor bow'd to less than stars or sun before  Her pitying smile accepts their suppliant claim  And adds four monarchs to the Christian name  Blest use of pow'r O virtuous pride in kings  And like his bounty whence dominion springs  Which o'er new worlds makes heaven's indulgence shine  And ranges myriads under laws divine  Well bought with all that those sweet regions hold  With groves of spices and with mines of gold  Fearless our merchant now pursues his gain  And roams securely o'er the boundless main  Now o'er his head the polar bear he spies  And freezing spangles of the Lapland skies  Now swells his canvas to the sultry line  With glitt'ring spoils where Indian grottoes shine  Where fumes of incense glad the southern seas  And wafted citron scents the balmy breeze  Here nearer suns prepare the rip'ning gem  To grace great ANNE's imperial diadem  And here the ore whose melted mass shall yield  On faithful coins each memorable field  Which mix'd with medals of immortal Rome  May clear disputes and teach the times to come  In circling beams shall godlike ANNA glow  And Churchill's sword hang o'er the prostrate foe  In comely wounds shall bleeding worthies stand  Webb's firm plattoon and Lumly's faithful band  Bold Mordaunt in Iberian trophies dress'd  And Campbell's dragon on his dauntless breast  Great Ormond's deeds on Vigo's spoils enroll'd  And Guiscard's knife on Harley's Chili gold  And if the muse O Bristol might decree  Here Granville noted by the lyre should be  The lyre for Granville and the cross for thee  Such are the honours grateful Britain pays  So patriots merit and so monarchs praise  O'er distant times such records shall prevail  When English numbers antiquated fail  A trifling song the muse can only yield  And sooth her soldiers panting from the field  To sweet retirements see them safe convey'd  And raise their battles in the rural shade  From fields of death to Woodstock's peaceful glooms  The poet's haunt Britannia's hero comes  Begin my muse and softly touch the string  Here Henry lov'd and Chaucer learn'd to sing  Hail fabled grotto hail Elysian soil  Thou fairest spot of fair Britannia's isle  Where kings of old conceal'd forgot the throne  And beauty was content to shine unknown  Where love and war by turns pavilions rear  And Henry's bow'rs near Blenheim's dome appear  The weary'd champion lull in soft alcoves  The noblest boast of thy romantick groves  Oft if the muse presage shall he be seen  By Rosamonda fleeting o'er the green  In dreams be hail'd by heroes' mighty shades  And hear old Chaucer warble through the glades  O'er the fam'd echoing vaults his name shall bound  And hill to hill reflect the fav'rite sound  Here here at least thy love for arms give o'er  Nor one world conquer'd fondly wish for more  Vice of great souls alone O thirst of fame  The muse admires it while she strives to blame  Thy toils be now to chace the bounding deer  Or view the coursers stretch in wild career  This lovely scene shall sooth thy soul to rest  And wear each dreadful image from thy breast  With pleasure by thy conquests shalt thou see  Thy Queen triumphant and all Europe free  No cares henceforth shall thy repose destroy  But what thou giv'st the world thy self enjoy  Sweet solitude when life's gay hours are past  Howe'er we range in thee we fix at last  Toss'd through tempestuous seas the voyage o'er  Pale we look back and bless the friendly shore  Our own strict judges our past life we sean  And ask if glory hath enlarg'd the span  If bright the prospect we the grave defy  Trust future ages and contented die  When strangers from fardistant climes shall come  To view the pomp of this triumphant dome  Where rear'd aloft dissembled trophies stand  And breathing labours of the sculptor's hand  Where Kneller's art shall paint the flying Gaul  And Bourbon's woes shall fill the story'd wall  Heirs of thy blood shall o'er their bounteous board  Fix Europe's guard thy monumental sword  Banners that oft have wav'd on conquer'd walls  And trumps that drown'd the groans of gasping Gauls  Fair dames shall oft with curious eye explore  The costly robes that slaughter'd gen'rals wore  Rich trappings from the Danube's whirlpools brought  Hesperian nuns the gorgeous broid'ry wrought  Belts stiff with gold the Boian horseman's pride  And Gaul's fair flow'rs in human crimson dy'd  Of Churchill's race perhaps some lovely boy  Shall mark the burnish'd steel that hangs on high  Shall gaze transported on its glitt'ring charms  And reach it struggling with unequal arms  By signs the drum's tumultuous sound request  Then seek in starts the hushing mother's breast  So in the painter's animated frame  Where Mars embraces the soft Paphian dame  The little Loves in sport the fauchion wield  Or join their strength to heave his pond'rous shield  One strokes the plume in Tityon's gore embru'd  And one the spear that reeks with Typhon's blood  Another's infant brows the helm sustain  He nods his crest and frights the shrieking train  Thus the rude tempest of the field o'erblown  Shall whiter rounds of smiling years roll on  Our victors blest in peace forget their wars  Enjoy past dangers and absolve the stars  But oh what sorrows shall bedew your urns  Ye honour'd shades whom widow'd Albion mourns  If your thin forms yet discontented moan  And haunt the mangled mansions once your own  Behold what flow'rs the pious muses strow  And tears which in the midst of triumph flow  Cypress and bays your envy'd brows surround  Your names the tender matron's heart shall wound  And the soft maid grow pensive at the sound  Accept great ANNE the tears their mem'ry draws  Who nobly perish'd in their sov'reign's cause  For thou in pity bid'st the war give o'er  Mourn'st thy slain heroes nor wilt venture more  Vast price of blood on each victorious day  But Europe's freedom doth that price repay  Lamented triumphs when one breath must tell  That Marlb'rough conquer'd and that Dormer fell  Great Queen whose name strikes haughty monarchs pale  On whose just scepter hangs Europa's scale  Whose arm like mercy wounds decides like fate  On whose decree the nations anxious wait  From Albion's cliffs thy wideextended hand  Shall o'er the main to far Peru command  So vast a tract whose wide domain shall run  It's cirling skies shall see no setting sun  Thee thee an hundred languages shall claim  And savage Indians swear by ANNA's name  The line and poles shall own thy rightful sway  And thy commands the sever'd globe obey  Round the vast ball thy new dominions chain  The wat'ry kingdoms and controul the main  Magellan's streights to Gibraltar they join  Across the seas a formidable line  The sight of adverse Gaul we fear no more  But pleas'd see Dunkirk now a guiltless shore  In vain great Neptune tore the narrow ground  And meant his waters for Britannia's bound  Her giant Genius takes a mighty stride  And sets his foot beyond th' incroaching tide  On either bank the land it's master knows  And in the midst the subject ocean flows  So near proud Rhodes across the raging flood  Stupendous form the vast Colossus stood  While at one foot their thronging gallies ride  A whole hour's sail scarce reach'd the farther side  Betwixt his brazen thighs in loose array  Ten thousand streamers on the billows play  By Harley's counsels Dunkirk now restor'd  To Britain's empire owns her antient lord  In him transfus'd his godlike father reigns  Rich in the blood which swell'd that patriot's veins  Who boldly faithful met his sov'reign's frown  And scorn'd for gold to yield th' important town  His son was born the ravish'd prey to claim  And France still trembles at an Harley's name  A fort so dreadful to our English shore  Our fleets scarce fear'd the sands or tempests more  Whose vast expences to such sums amount  That the tax'd Gaul scarce furnish'd out th' account  Whose walls such bulwarks such vast tow'rs restrain  It's weakest ramparts are the rocks and main  His boast great LOUIS yields and cheaply buys  Thy friendship ANNA with the mighty prize  Holland repining and in grief cast down  Sees the new glories of the British crown  Ah may they ne'er provoke thee to the fight  Nor foes more dreadful than the Gaul invite  Soon may they hold the olive soon asswage  Their secret murmurs nor call forth thy rage  To rend their banks and pour at one command  Thy realm the sea o'er their precarious land  Henceforth be thine vicegerent of the skies  Scorn'd worth to raise and vice in robes chastise  To dry the orphan's tears and from the bar  Chace the brib'd judge and hush the wordy war  Deny the curs'd blasphemer's tongue to rage  And turn God's fury from an impious age  Blest change the soldier's late destroying hand  Shall rear new temples in his native land  Mistaken zealots shall with fear behold  And beg admittance in our sacred fold  On her own works the pious Queen shall smile  And turn her cares upon her fav'rite isle  So the keen bolt a warrior angel aims  Array'd in clouds and wrapt in mantling flames  He bears a tempest on his sounding wings  And his red arm the forky vengeance flings  At length heav'n's wrath appeas'd he quits the war  To roll his orb and guide his destin'd star  To shed kind fate and lucky hours bestow  And smile propitious on the world below  Around thy throne shall faithful nobles wait  These guard the church and those direct the state  To Bristol graceful in maternal tears  The church her tow'ry forehead gently rears  She begs her pious son t' assert her cause  Defend her rights and reinforce her laws  With holy zeal the sacred work begin  To bend the stubborn and the meek to win  Our Oxford's earl in careful thought shall stand  To raise his Queen and save a sinking land  The wealthiest glebe to rav'nous Spaniards known  He marks and makes the golden world our own  Content with hands unsoil'd to guard the prize  And keep the store with undesiring eyes  So round the tree that bore Hesperian gold  The sacred watch lay curl'd in many a fold  His eyes uprearing to th' untasted prey  The sleepless guardian wasted life away  Beneath the peaceful olives rais'd by you  Her antient pride shall ev'ry art renew  The arts with you fam'd Harcourt shall defend  And courtly Bolingbroke the muse's friend  With piercing eye some search where nature plays  And trace the wanton through her darksome maze  Whence health from herbs from seeds how groves begun  How vital stre ms in circling eddies run  Some teach why round the sun the spheres advance  In the fix d measures of their mystick dance  How tides when heav'd by pressing moons o'erflow  And sunborn Iris paints her show'ry bow  In happy chains our daring language bound  Shall sport no more in arbitrary sound  But buskin'd bards henceforth shall wisely rage  And Grecian plans reform Britannia's stage  Till Congreve bids her smile Augusta stands  And longs to weep when flowing Rowe commands  Britain's Spectators shall their strength combine  To mend our morals and our taste refine  Fight virtue's cause stand up in wit's defence  Win us from vice and laugh us into sense  Nor Prior hast thou hush'd the trump in vain  Thy lyre shall now revive her mirthful strain  New tales shall now be told if right I see  The soul of Chaucer is restor'd in thee  Garth in majestick numbers to the stars  Shall raise mockheroes and fantastick wars  Like the young spreading laurel Pope thy name  Shoots up with strength and rises into fame  With Philips shall the peaceful vallies ring  And Britain hear a second Spenser sing  That muchlov'd youth whom Utrecht's walls confine  To Bristol's praises shall his Strafford's join  He too from whom attentive Oxford draws  Rules for just thinking and poetick laws  To growing bards his learned aid shall lend  The strictest critick and the kindest friend  Ev'n mine a bashful muse whose rude essays  Scarce hope for pardon not aspire to praise  Cherish'd by you in time may grow to fame  And mine survive with Bristol's glorious name  Fir'd with the views this glitt'ring scene displays  And smit with passion for my country's praise  My artless reed attempts this lofty theme  Where sacred Isis rolls her antient stream  In cloyster'd domes the great Philippa's pride  Where learning blooms while fame and worth preside  Where the fifth Henry arts and arms was taught  And Edward form'd his Cressy yet unfought  Where laurel'd bards have struck the warbling strings  The seat of sages and the nurse of kings  Here thy commands O Lancaster inflame  My eager breast to raise the British name  Urge on my soul with no ignoble pride  To woo the muse whom Addison enjoy'd  See that bold swan to heav'n sublimely soar  Pursue at distance and his steps adore  To the RIGHT HONOURABLE the EARL of  WARWICK  c  By the Same  IF dumb too long the drooping Muse hath stay'd  And left her debt to Addison unpaid  Blame not her silence Warwick but bemoan  And judge oh judge my bosom by your own  What mourner ever felt poetick fires  Slow comes the verse that real woe inspires  Grief unaffected suits but ill with art  Or flowing numbers with a bleeding heart  Can I forget the dismal night that gave  My soul's best part forever to the grave  How silent did his old companions tread  By midnight lamps the mansions of the dead  Thro' breathing statues then unheeded things  Thro' rows of warriors and thro' walks of kings  What awe did the slow solemn knell inspire  The pealing organ and the pausing choir  The duties by the lawnrob'd prelate pay'd  And the last words that dust to dust convey'd  While speechless o'er thy closing grave we bend  Accept these tears thou dear departed friend  Oh gone for ever take this long adieu  And sleep in peace next thy lov'd Montagu  To strew fresh laurels let the task be mine  A frequent pilgrim at thy sacred shrine  Mine with true sighs thy absence to bemoan  And grave with faithful epitaphs thy stone  If e'er from me thy lov'd memorial part  May shame afflict this alienated heart  Of thee forgetful if I form a song  My lyre be broken and untun'd my tongue  My grief be doubled from thy image free  And mirth a torment unchastis'd by thee  Oft let me range the gloomy iles alone  Sad luxury to vulgar minds unknown  Along the walls where speaking marbles show  What worthies form the hallow'd mould below  Proud names who once the reins of empire held  In arms who triumph'd or in arts excell'd  Chiefs grac'd with scars and prodigal of blood  Stern patriots who for sacred freedom stood  Just men by whom impartial laws were given  And saints who taught and led the way to heav'n  Ne'er to these chambers where the mighty rest  Since their foundation came a nobler guest  Nor e'er was to the bowers of bliss convey'd  A fairer spirit or more welcome shade  In what new region to the just assign'd  What new employments please th' unbody'd mind  A winged virtue through th' ethereal sky  From world to world unweary'd does he fly  Or curious trace the long laborious maze  Of heav'n's decrees where wond'ring angels gaze  Does he delight to hear bold seraphs tell  How Michael battel'd and the Dragon fell  Or mix'd with milder cherubim to glow  In hymns of love not illessay'd below  Or dost thou warn poor mortals left behind  A task well suited to thy gentle mind  Oh if sometimes thy spotless form descend  To me thy aid thou guardian genius lend  When rage misguides me or when fear alarms  When pain distresses or when pleasure charms  In silent whisp'rings purer thoughts impart  And turn from ill a frail and feeble heart  Lead through the paths thy virtue trod before  'Till bliss shall join nor death can part us more  That awful form which so ye heav'ns decree  Must still be lov'd and still deplor'd by me  In nightly visions seldom fails to rise  Or rous'd by fancy meets my waking eyes  If business calls or crouded courts invite  Th' unblemish'd statesman seems to strike my sight  If in the stage I seek to sooth my care  I meet his soul which breathes in Cato there  If pensive to the rural shades I rove  His shape o'ertakes me in the lonely grove  'Twas there of just and good he reason'd strong  Clear'd some great truth or rais'd some serious song  There patient show'd us the wise course to steer  A candid censor and a friend severe  There taught us how to live and oh too high  The price for knowledge taught us how to die  Thou hill whose brow the antique structures grace  Rear'd by bold chiefs of Warwick's noble race  Why once so lov'd whene'er thy bower appears  O'er my dim eyeballs glance the sudden tears  How sweet were once thy prospects fresh and fair  Thy sloping walks and unpolluted air  How sweet the glooms beneath thy aged trees  Thy noontide shadow and thy evening breeze  His image thy forsaken bowers restore  Thy walks and airy prospects charm no more  No more the summer in thy glooms allay'd  Thy evening breezes and thy noonday shade  From other ills however fortune frown'd  Some refuge in the muse's art I found  Reluctant now I touch the trembling string  Bereft of him who taught me how to sing  And these sad accents murmur'd o'er his urn  Betray that absence they attempt to mourn  Oh must I then now fresh my bosom bleeds  And Craggs in death to Addison succeeds  The verse begun to one lost friend prolong  And weep a second in th' unfinish'd song  These works divine which on his deathbed laid  To thee O Craggs th' expiring sage convey'd  Great but illomen'd monument of fame  Nor he surviv'd to give nor thou to claim  Swift after him thy social spirit flies  And close to his how soon thy coffin lies  Blest pair whose union future bards shall tell  In future tongues each other's boast farewel  Farewel whom join'd in fame in friendship try'd  No chance could sever nor the grave divide  COLIN AND LUCY  By the Same  I  OF Leinster fam'd for maidens fair  Bright LUCY was the grace  Nor e'er did Liffy's limpid stream  Reflect a fairer face  II  'Till luckless love and pining care  Impair'd her rosy hue  Her dainty lip her damask cheek  And eyes of glossy blue  III  Ah have you seen a lily pale  When beating rains descend  So droop'd this slowconsuming maid  Her life now near it's end  IV  By LUCY warn'd of flatt'ring swains  Take heed ye easy fair  Of vengeance due to broken vows  Ye flatt'ring swains beware  V  Three times all in the dead of night  A bell was hear'd to ring  And at her window shrieking thrice  The raven flap'd his wing  VI  Full well the lovelorn maiden knew  The solemnboding sound  And thus in dying words bespoke  The virgins weeping round  VII  "I hear a voice you cannot hear  "That cries I must not stay  "I see a hand you cannot see  "That beckons me away  VIII  "Of a false swain and broken heart  "In early youth I die  "Am I to blame because the bride  "Is twice as rich as I  IX  "Ah COLIN give not her thy vows  "Vows due to me alone  "Nor thou rash girl receive his kiss  "Nor think him all thy own  X  "Tomorrow in the church to wed  "Impatient both prepare  "But know false man and know fond maid  "Poor LUCY will be there  XI  "Then bear my corse ye comrades dear  "The bridegroom blithe to meet  "He in his weddingtrim so gay  "I in my windingsheet"  XII  She spoke she dy'd her corse was borne  The bridegroom blithe to meet  He in his weddingtrim so gay  She in her windingsheet  XIII  What then were COLIN's dreadful thoughts  How were these nuptials kept  The bride'smen flock'd round LUCY dead  And all the village wept  XIV  Compassion shame remorse despair  At once his bosom swell  The damps of death bedew'd his brow  He groan'd he shook he fell  XV  From the vain bride a bride no more  The varying crimson fled  When stretch'd beside her rival's corse  She saw her lover dead  XVI  He to his LUCY's newmade grave  Convey'd by trembling swains  In the same mould beneath one sod  Forever now remains  XVII  Oft at this place the constant hind  And plighted maid are seen  With garlands gay and truelove knots  They deck the sacred green  XVIII  But swain forsworn whoe'er thou art  This hallowed ground forbear  Remember COLIN's dreadful fate  And fear to meet him there  AN IMITATION OF THE PROPHECY OF  NEREUS  From HORACE Book III Ode XXV  Dicam insigne recens adhuc  Indictum ore alio Non secus in jugis  Exsomnis stupet Evias  Hebrum prospiciens nive candidam  Thracen ac pede barbaro  Lustratam Rhodopen  HOR  By the Same  AS Mar his round one morning took  Whom some call earl and some call duke  And his new brethren of the blade  Shiv'ring with fear and frost survey'd  On Perth's bleak hills he chanc'd to spy  An aged wizard six foot high  With bristled hair and visage blighted  Walley'd barehaunch'd and secondsighted  The grizly sage in thought profound  Beheld the chief with back so round  Then roll'd his eyeballs to and fro  O'er his paternal hills of snow  And into these tremendous speeches  Broke forth the prophet without breeches  Into what ills betray'd by thee  This ancient kingdom do I see  Her realms unpeopled and forlorn  Wae's me that ever thou wert born  Proud English loons our clans o'ercome  On Scottish pads shall amble home  I see them drest in bonnets blue  The spoils of thy rebellious crew  I see the target cast away  And chequer'd plad become their prey  The chequer'd plad to make a gown  For many a lass in London town  In vain thy hungry mountaineers  Come forth in all their warlike geers  The shield the pistol durk and dagger  In which they daily wont to swagger  And oft have sally'd out to pillage  The henroosts of some peaceful village  Or while their neighbours were asleep  Have carry'd off a lowland sheep  What boots thy highborn host of beggars  Macleans Mackenzies and Macgregors  With Popish cutthroats perjur'd ruffians  And Forster's troops of raggamuffins  In vain thy lads around thee bandy  Inflam'd with bagpipe and with brandy  Doth not bold Sutherland the trusty  With heart so true and voice so rusty  A loyal Soul thy troops affright  While hoarsely he demands the fight  Do'st thou not gen'rous Ilay dread  The bravest hand the wisest head  Undaunted do'st thou hear th'alarms  Of hoary Athol sheath'd in arms  Douglas who draws his lineage down  From thanes and peers of high renown  Fiery and young and uncontrol'd  With knights and squires and barons bold  His noble housholdband advances  And on his milkwhite courser prances  Thee Forfar to the combat dares  Grown swarthy in Iberian wars  And Monroe kindled into rage  Sow'rly defies thee to engage  He'll rout thy foot though ne'er so many  And horse to bootif thou had'st any  But see Argyle with watchful eyes  Lodg'd in his deep intrenchment lies  Couch'd like a lion in thy way  He waits to spring upon his prey  While like a herd of tim'rous deer  Thy army shakes and pants with fear  Led by their doughty gen'ral's skill  From frith to frith from hill to hill  Is thus thy haughty promise pay'd  That to the Chevalier was made  When thou didst oaths and duty barter  For dukedom gen'ralship and garter  Three m ons thy Jemmy shall command  With highland scepter in his hand  Too good for his pretended birth  Then down shall fall the king of Perth  'Tis so decreed for GEORGE shall reign  And traitors be forsworn in vain  Heav'n shall for ever on him smile  And bless him still with an Argyle  While thou pursu'd by vengeful foes  Condemn'd to barren rocks and snows  And hinder'd passing Inverlocky  Shall burn thy clan and curse poor Joky  TO Sir GODFREY KNELLER at his COUNTRY SEAT  By the Same  TO Whitton's shades and Hounslow's airy plain  Thou KNELLER tak'st thy summer flights in vain  In vain thy wish gives all thy rural hours  To the fair villa and wellorder'd bowers  To court thy pencil early at thy gates  Ambition knocks and fleeting beauty waits  The boastful muse of others fame so sure  Implores thy aid to make her own secure  The great the fair and if ought nobler be  Ought more belov'd the arts solicit thee  How can'st thou hope to fly the world in vain  From Europe sever'd by the circling main  Sought by the kings of every distant land  And every hero worthy of thy hand  Hast thou forgot that mighty Bourbon fear'd  He still was mortal till thy draught appear'd  That Cosmo chose thy glowing form to place  Amidst her masters of the Lombard race  See on her Titian's and her Guido's urns  Her failing arts forlorn Hesperia mourns  While Britain wins each garland from her brow  Her wit and freedom first her painting now  Let the faint copier on old Tyber's shore  Nor mean the task each breathing bust explore  Line after line with painful patience trace  This Roman grandeur that Athenian grace  Vain care of parts if impotent of soul  Th' industrious workman fails to warm the whole  Each theft betrays the marble whence it came  And a cold statue stiffens in the frame  Thee nature taught nor art her aid deny'd  The kindest mistress and the surest guide  To catch a likeness at one piercing sight  And place the fairest in the fairest light  Ere yet thy pencil tries her nicer toils  Or on thy palette lie the blendid oyls  Thy careless chalk has half atchiev'd thy art  And her just image makes Cleora start  A mind that grasps the whole is rarely found  Half learn'd half painters and half wits abound  Few like thy genius at proportion aim  All great all graceful and throughout the same  Such be thy life O since the glorious rage  That fir'd thy youth flames unsubdu'd by age  Tho' wealth nor fame now touch thy sated mind  Still tinge the canvas bounteous to mankind  Since after thee may rise an impious line  Coarse manglers of the human face divine  Paint on till fate dissolve thy mortal part  And live and die the monarch of thy art  ON THE DEATH of the EARL of CADOGAN  By the Same  OF Marlb'rough's captains and Eugenio's friends  The last CADOGAN to the grave descends  Low lies each hand whence Blenheim's glory sprung  The chiefs who conquer'd and the bards who sung  From his cold corse tho' every friend be fled  Lo envy waits that lover of the dead  Thus did she feign o'er Nassau's herse to mourn  Thus wept infidious Churchill o'er thy urn  To blast the living gave the dead their due  And wreaths herself had tainted trim'd anew  Thou yet unnam'd to fill his empty place  And lead to war thy country's growing race  Take every wish a British heart can frame  Add palm to palm and rise from same to fame  An hour must come when thou shalt hear with rage  Thyself traduc'd and curse a thankless age  Nor yet for this decline the gen'rous strife  These ills brave man shall quit thee with thy life  Alive though stain'd by every abject slave  Secure of fame and justice in the grave  Ah nowhen once the mortal yields to fate  The blast of fame's sweet trumpet sounds too late  Too late to stay the spirit on its flight  Or sooth the new inhabitant of light  Who hears regardless while fond man distress'd  Hangs on the absent and laments the blest  Farewel then fame ill sought thro' fields and blood  Farewel unfaithful promiser of good  Thou musick warbling to the deafen'd ear  Thou incense wasted on the fun'ral bier  Through life pursu'd in vain by death obtain'd  When ask'd deny'd us and when given disdain'd  AN ODE Inscribed to the Right Honourable the EARL of  SUNDERLAND  at  WINDSOR  By the Same  I  THOU dome where Edward first enroll'd  His redcross knights and barons bold  Whose vacant seats by virtue bought  Ambitious emperors have sought  Where Britain's foremost names are found  In peace belov'd in war renown'd  Who made the hostile nations moan  Or brought a blessing on their own  II  Once more a son of SPENCER waits  A name familiar to thy gates  Sprung from the chief whose prowess gain'd  The garter while thy founder reign'd  He offer'd here his dinted shield  The dread of Gauls in Cressi's field  Which in thy higharch'd temple rais'd  For four long centuries hath blaz'd  III  These seats our sires a hardy kind  To the fierce sons of war confin'd  The flower of chivalry who drew  With sinewy arm the stubborn yew  Or with heav'd pollaxe clear'd the field  Or who in jousts and tourneys skill'd  Before their ladies' eyes renown'd  Threw horse and horseman to the ground  IV  In aftertimes as courts refin'd  Our patriots in the list were join'd  Nor only Warwick stain'd with blood  Or Marlb'rough near the Danube's flood  Have in their crimson crosses glow'd  But on just lawgivers bestow'd  These emblems Cecil did invest  And gleam'd on wise Godolphin's breast  V  So Greece e'er arts began to rise  Fix'd huge Orion in the skies  And stern Alcides fam'd in wars  Bespangled with a thousand stars  Till letter'd Athens round the pole  Made gentler constellations roll  In the blue heavens the  Names of Constellations  Lyre she strung  And near the Maid the Balance hung  VI  Then SPENCER mount amid the band  Where knights and kings promiscuous stand  What though the hero's flame repress'd  Burns calmly in thy generous breast  Yet who more dauntless to oppose  In doubtful days our homebred foes  Who rais'd his country's wealth so high  Or view'd with less desiring eye  VII  The sage who large of soul surveys  The globe and all its empires weighs  Watchful the various climes to guide  Which seas and tongues and faiths divide  A nobler name in Windsor's shrine  Shall leave if right the muse divine  Than sprung of old abhorr'd and vain  From ravag'd realms and myriads slain  VIII  Why praise we prodigal of fame  The rage that sets the world on flame  My guiltless muse his brow shall bind  Whose godlike bounty spares mankind  For those whom bloody garlands crown  The brass may breathe the marble frown  To him through every rescu'd land  Ten thousand living trophies stand  KENSINGTON  GARDEN  By the Same  Campos ubi Troja fuit  Virg  WHERE Kensington high o'er the neighb'ring lands  'Midst greens and sweets a regal fabrick stands  And sees each spring luxuriant in her bowers  A snow of blossoms and a wild of flowers  The dames of Britain oft in crowds repair  To groves and lawns and unpolluted air  Here while the town in damps and darkness lies  They breathe in sunshine and see azure skies  Each walk with robes of various dyes bespread  Seems from afar a moving tulipbed  Where rich brocades and glossy damasks glow  And chints the rival of the show'ry bow  Here England's Daughter darling of the land  Sometimes surrounded with her virgin band  Gleams through the shades She tow'ring o'er the rest  Stands fairest of the fairer kind confess'd  Form'd to gain hearts that Brunswick's cause deny'd  And charm a people to her Father's side  Long have these groves to royal guests been known  Nor Nassau first prefer'd them to a throne  Ere Norman banners wav'd in British air  Ere lordly Hubba with the golden hair  Pour'd in his Danes ere elder Julius came  Or Dardan Brutus gave our isle a name  A prince of Albion's lineage grac'd the wood  The scene of wars and stain'd with lovers' blood  You who through gazing crowds your captive throng  Throw pangs and passions as you move along  Turn on the left ye fair your radiant eyes  Where all unlevel'd the gay garden lies  If generous anguish for another's pains  Ere heav'd your hearts or shiver'd through your veins  Look down attentive on the pleasing dale  And listen to my melancholy tale  That hollow space where now in living rows  Line above line the yew's sad verdure grows  Was ere the planter's hand it's beauty gave  A common pit a rude unfashion'd cave  The landskip now so sweet we well may praise  But far far sweeter in its ancient days  Far sweeter was it when its peopled ground  With fairy domes and dazling tow'rs was crown'd  Where in the midst those verdant pillars spring  Rose the proud palace of the Elfin king  For ev'ry hedge of vegetable green  In happier years a crowded street was seen  Nor all those leaves that now the prospect grace  Could match the numbers of its pigmy race  What urg'd this mighty empire to its fate  A tale of woe and wonder I relate  When Albion rul'd the land whose lineage came  From Neptune mingling with a mortal dame  Their midnight pranks the sprightly fairies play'd  On ev'ry hill and danc'd in ev'ry shade  But foes to sunshine most they took delight  In dells and dales conceal'd from human sight  There hew'd their houses in the arching rock  Or scoop'd the bosom of the blasted oak  Or heard o'ershadow'd by some shelving hill  The distant murmurs of the falling rill  They rich in pilfer'd spoils indulg'd their mirth  And pity'd the huge wretched sons of earth  Even now 'tis said the hinds o'erhear their strain  And strive to view their airy forms in vain  They to their cells at man's approach repair  Like the shy leveret or the mother hare  The whilst poor mortals startle at the sound  Of unseen footsteps on the haunted ground  Amid this garden then with woods o'ergrown  Stood the lov'd seat of royal Oberon  From every region to his palacegate  Came peers and princes of the fairy state  Who rank'd in council round the sacred shade  Their monarch's will and great behests obey'd  From Thame's fair banks by lofty towers adorn'd  With loads of plunder oft his chiefs return'd  Hence in proud robes and colours bright and gay  Shone every knight and every lovely fay  Whoe'er on Powell's dazling stage display'd  Hath fam'd king Pepin and his court survey'd  May guess if old by modern things we trace  The pomp and splendor of the fairy race  By magick fenc'd by spells encompass'd round  No mortal touch'd this interdicted ground  No mortal enter'd those alone who came  Stolen from the couch of some terrestrial dame  For oft of babes they robb'd the matron's bed  And left some sickly changeling in their stead  It chanc'd a youth of Albion's royal blood  Was foster'd here the wonder of the wood  Milkah for wiles above her peers renown'd  Deepskill'd in charms and many a mystick sound  As through the regal dome she sought for prey  Observ'd the infant Albion where he lay  In mantles broider'd o'er with gorgeous pride  And stole him from the sleeping mother's side  Who now but Milkah triumphs in her mind  Ah wretched nymph to future evils blind  The time shall come when thou shalt dearly pay  The theft hardhearted of that guilty day  Thou in thy turn shalt like the Queen repine  And all her sorrows doubled shall be thine  He who adorns thy house the lovely boy  Who now adorns it shall at length destroy  Two hundred moons in their pale course had seen  The gayrob'd fairies glimmer on the green  And Albion now had reach'd in youthful prime  To nineteen years as mortals measure time  Flush'd with resistless charms he fir'd to love  Each nymph and little Dryad of the grove  For skilful Milkah spar'd not to employ  Her utmost art to rear the princely boy  Each supple limb she swaith'd and tender bone  And to the Elfin standard kept him down  She robb'd dwarfelders of their fragrant fruit  And fed him early with the daisy's root  Whence through his veins the powerful juices ran  And form'd in beauteous miniature the Man  Yet still two inches taller than the rest  His lofty port his human birth confess'd  A foot in height how stately did he show  How look superior on the crowd below  What knight like him could toss the rushy launce  Who move so graceful in the mazy dance  A shape so nice or features half so fair  What elf could boast or such a flow of hair  Bright Kenna saw a princess born to reign  And felt the charmer burn in ev'ry vein  She heiress to this empire's potent lord  Prais'd like the stars and next the moon ador'd  She whom at distance thrones and princedoms view'd  To whom proud Oriel and Azuriel sue'd  In her high palace languish'd void of joy  And pin'd in secret for a mortal boy  He too was smitten and discreetly strove  By courtly deeds to gain the virgin's love  For her he cull'd the fairest flowers that grew  Ere morning suns had drain'd their fragrant dew  He chac'd the hornet in his midday flight  And brought her glowworms in the noon of night  When on ripe fruits she cast a wishing eye  Did ever Albion think the tree too high  He show'd her where the pregnant goldfinch hung  And the wrenmother brooding o'er her young  To her th' inscription on their eggs he read  Admire ye clerks the youth whom Milkah bred  To her he show'd each herb of virtuous juice  Their powers distinguish'd and describ'd their use  All vain their powers alas to Kenna prove  And well sung Ovid  There's no herb for love  As when a ghost enlarg'd from realms below  Seeks its old friend to tell some secret woe  The poor shade shivering stands and must not break  His painful silence 'till the mortal speak  So far'd it with the little lovesick maid  Forbid to utter what her eyes betray'd  He saw her anguish and reveal'd his flame  And spar'd the blushes of the tonguety'd dame  The day would fail me should I reckon o'er  The sighs they lavish'd and the oaths they swore  In words so melting that compar'd with those  The nicest courtship of terrestrial beaus  Wou'd sound like compliments from country clowns  To redcheek'd sweethearts in their homespun gowns  All in a lawn of many a various hue  A bed of flowers a fairy forest grew  'Twas here one noon the gaudiest of the May  The still the secret silent hour of day  Beneath a lofty tulip's ample shade  Sate the young lover and th' immortal maid  They thought all fairies slept ah luckless pair  Hid but in vain in the sun's noontide glare  When Albion leaning on his Kenna's breast  Thus all the softness of his soul express'd  'All things are hush'd The sun's meridian rays  'Veil the horizon in one mighty blaze  'Nor moon nor star in heaven's blue arch is seen  'With kindly rays to silver o'er the green  'Grateful to fairy eyes they secret take  'Their rest and only wretched mortals wake  'This dead of day I fly to thee alone  'A world to me a multitude in one  'Oh sweet as dewdrops on these flowery lawns  'When the sky opens and the evening dawns  'Streight as the pink that towers so high in air  'Soft as the blowbell as the daisy fair  'Blest be the hour when first I was convey'd  'An infant captive to this blissful shade  'And blest the hand that did my form refine  'And shrunk my stature to a match with thine  'Glad I for thee renounce my royal birth  'And all the giant daughters of the earth  'Thou if thy breast with equal ardour burn  'Renounce thy kind and love for love return  'So from us two combin'd by nuptial ties  'A race unknown of demigods shall rise  'Oh speak my love my vows with vows repay  'And sweetly swear my rising fears away'  To whom the shining azure of her eyes  More brighten'd thus th' enamour'd maid replies  'By all the stars and first the glorious moon  'I swear and by the head of Oberon  'A dreadful oath no prince of fairy line  'Shall e'er in wedlock plight his vows with mine  'Wheree'er my footsteps in the dance are seen  'May toadstools rise and mildews blast the green  'May the keen eastwind blight my fav'rite flowers  'And snakes and spotted adders haunt my bowers  'Confin'd whole ages in an hemlock shade  'There rather pine I a neglected maid  'Or worse exil'd from Cynthia's gentle rays  'Parch in the sun a thousand summerdays  'Than any prince a prince of sairy line  'In sacred wedlock plight his vows with mine'  She ended and with lips of rosy hue  Dipt five times over in ambrofial dew  Stifled his words When from his covert rear'd  The frowning brow of Oberon appear'd  A sunflower's trunk was near whence killing sight  The monarch issu'd half an ell in height  Full on the pair a furious look he cast  Nor spoke but gave his buglehorn a blast  That through the woodland echo'd far and wide  And drew a swarm of subjects to his side  A hundred chosen knights in war renown'd  Drive Albion banish'd from the sacred ground  And twice ten myriads guard the bright abodes  Where the proud king amidst his demigods  For Kenna's sudden bridal bids prepare  And to Azuriel gives the weeping fair  If fame in arms with antient birth combin'd  A faultless beauty and a spotless mind  To love and praise can generous souls incline  That love Azuriel and that praise were thine  Blood only less than royal fill'd thy veins  Proud was thy roof and large thy fair domains  Where now the skies high Hollandhouse invades  And shortliv'd Warwick sadden'd all the shades  Thy dwelling stood nor did in him afford  A nobler owner or a lovelier lord  For thee a hundred fields produc'd their store  And by thy name ten thousand vassals swore  So lov'd thy name that at their monarch's choice  All Fairy shouted with a general voice  Oriel alone a secret rage suppress'd  That from his bosom heav'd the golden vest  Along the banks of Thame his empire ran  Wide was his range and populous his clan  When cleanly servants if we trust old tales  Beside their wages had good fairy vailes  Whole heaps of silver tokens nightly paid  The careful wife or the neat dairymaid  Sunk not his stores With smiles and powerful bribes  He gain'd the leaders of his neighbour tribes  And ere the night the face of heav'n had chang'd  Beneath his banners half the fairies rang'd  Meanwhile driven back to earth a lonely way  The chearless Albion wander'd half the day  A long long journey choak'd with brakes and thorns  Ill measur'd by ten thousand barlycorns  Tir'd out at length a spreading stream he spy'd  Fed by old Thame a daughter of the tide  'Twas then a spreading stream tho' now its fame  Obscur'd it bears the Creek's inglorious name  And creeps as through contracted bounds it strays  A leap for boys in these degenerate days  On the clear chrystal's verdant bank he stood  And thrice look'd backward on the fatal wood  And thrice he groan'd and thrice he beat his breast  And thus in tears his kindred gods address'd  'If true ye watery powers my lineage came  'From Neptune mingling with a mortal dame  'Down to his court with coral garlands crown'd  'Through all your grottoes waft my plaintive sound  'And urge the god whose trident shakes the earth  'To grace his offspring and assert my birth'  He said A gentle Naiad heard his prayer  And touch'd with pity for a lover's care  Shoots to the sea where low beneath the tides  Old Neptune in th' unfathom'd deep resides  Rous'd at the news the sea's stern sultan swore  Revenge and scarce from present arms forbore  But first the nymph his harbinger he sends  And to her care the fav'rite boy commends  As through the Thames her backward course she guides  Driven up his current by the refluent tides  Along his banks the pygmy legions spread  She spies and haughty Oriel at their head  Soon with wrong'd Albion's name the host she fires  And counts the ocean's god among his sires  'The ocean's god by whom shall be o'erthrown  'Styx heard his oath the tyrant Oberon  'See here beneath a toadstool's deadly gloom  'Lies Albion Him the fates your leader doom  'Hear and obey 'tis Neptune's powerful call  'By him Azuriel and his king shall fall'  She said They bow'd and on their shields upbore  With shouts their newsaluted emperor  Even Oriel smil'd at least to smile he strove  And hopes of vengeance triumph'd over love  See now the mourner of the lonely shade  By gods protected and by hosts obey'd  A slave a chief by sickle fortune's play  In the short course of one revolving day  What wonder if the youth so strangely blest  Felt his heart flutter in his little breast  His thick embattell'd troops with secret pride  He views extended half an acre wide  More light he treads more tall he seems to rise  And struts a strawbreadth nearer to the skies  O for thy muse  Mr Addison  great Bard whose lofty strains  In battle join'd the Pygmies and the Cranes  Each gaudy knight had I that warmth divine  Each colour'd legion in my verse should shine  But simple I and innocent of art  The tale that sooth'd my infant years impart  The tale I heard whole winter eves untir'd  And sing the battles that my nurse inspir'd  Now the shrill cornpipes echoing loud to arms  To rank and file reduce the straggling swarms  Thick rows of spears at once with sudden glare  A grove of needles glitter in the air  Loose in the winds small ribbon streamers flow  Dipt in all colours of the heavenly bow  And the gay host that now it's march pursues  Gleams o'er the meadows in a thousand hues  On Buda's plains thus formidably bright  Shone Asia's sons a pleasing dreadful sight  In various robes their silken troops were seen  The blue the red and prophet's sacred green  When blooming BRUNSWICK near the Danube's flood  First stain'd his maiden sword in Turkish blood  Unseen and silent march the slow brigades  Through pathless wilds and unfrequented shades  In hope already vanquish'd by surprize  In Albion's power the fairy empire lies  Already has he seiz'd on Kenna's charms  And the glad beauty trembles in his arms  The march concludes and now in prospect near  But fenc'd with arms the hostile towers appear  For Oberon or Druids falsely sing  Wore his prime Visir in a magick ring  A subtle spright that opening plots foretold  By sudden dimness on the beamy gold  Hence in a crescent form'd his legions bright  With beating bosoms waited for the fight  To charge their foes they march a glittering band  And in their van doth bold Azuriel stand  What rage that hour did Albion's soul possess  Let chiefs imagine and let lovers guess  Forth issuing from his ranks that strove in vain  To check his course athwart the dreadful plain  He strides indignant and with haughty cries  To single fight the fairy prince defies  Forbear rash youth th' unequal war to try  Nor sprung from mortals with immortals vie  No God stands ready to avert thy doom  Nor yet thy grandsire of the waves is come  My words are vainno words the wretch can move  By beauty dazled and bewitch'd by love  He longs he burns to win the glorious prize  And sees no danger while he sees her eyes  Now from each host the eager warriors start  And furious Albion flings his hasty dart  'Twas feather'd from the bee's transparent wing  And it's shaft ended in a hornet's sting  But toss'd in rage it flew without a wound  High o'er the foe and guiltless pierc'd the ground  Not so Azuriel's with unerring aim  Too near the needlepointed javelin came  Drove through the sevenfold shield and silken vest  And lightly ras'd the lover's ivory breast  Rous'd at the smart and rising to the blow  With his keen sword he cleaves his fairy foe  Sheer from the shoulder to the waste he cleaves  And of one arm the tott'ring trunk bereaves  His useless steel brave Albion wields no more  But sternly smiles and thinks the combat o'er  So had it been had aught of mortal strain  Or less than fairy felt the deadly pain  But empyreal forms howe'er in fight  Gash'd and dismember'd easily unite  As some frail cup of China's purest mold  With azure varnish'd and bedrop'd with gold  Tho' broke if cur'd by some nice virgin's hands  In it's old strength and pristine beauty stands  The tumults of the boiling Bohea braves  And holds secure the Coffee's sable waves  So did Azuriel's arm if fame say true  Rejoin the vital trunk whence first it grew  And whilst in wonder fix'd poor Albion stood  Plung'd the curs'd sabre in his heart's warm blood  The golden broidery tender Milkah wove  The breast to Kenna sacred and to love  Lie rent and mangled and the gaping wound  Pours out a flood of purple on the ground  The jetty lustre sickens in his eyes  On his cold cheeks the bloomy freshness dies  'Oh Kenna Kenna thrice he try'd to say  'Kenna farewel' and sigh'd his soul away  His fall the Dryads with loud shrieks deplore  By sister Naiads echo'd from the shore  Thence down to Neptune's secret realms convey'd  Through grots and glooms and many a coral shade  The sea's great sire with looks denouncing war  The trident shakes and mounts the pearly carr  With one stern frown the widespread deep deforms  And works the madding ocean into storms  O'er foaming mountains and through bursting tides  Now high now low the bounding chariot rides  'Till through the Thames in a loud whirlwind's roar  It shoots and lands him on the destin'd shore  Now fix'd on earth his tow'ring stature stood  Hung o'er the mountains and o'erlook'd the wood  To Brumpton's grove one ample stride he took  The valleys trembled and the forests shook  The next huge step reach'd the devoted shade  Where choak'd in blood was wretched Albion laid  Where now the vanquish'd with the victors join'd  Beneath the regal banners stood combin'd  Th' embattel'd dwarfs with rage and scorn he past  And on their town his eye vindictive cast  Its deep foundations his strong trident cleaves  And high in air th' uprooted empire heaves  On his broad engine the vast ruin hung  Which on the foe with force divine he flung  Aghast the legions in th' approaching shade  Th' inverted spires and rocking domes survey'd  That downward tumbling on the host below  Crush'd the whole nation at one dreadful blow  Towers arms nymphs warriors are together lost  And a whole empire falls to sooth sad Albion's ghost  Such was the period long restrain'd by fate  And such the downfal of the fairy state  This dale a pleasing region not unblest  This dale possess'd they and had still possess'd  Had not their monarch with a father's pride  Rent from her lord th' inviolable bride  Rash to dissolve the contract seal'd above  The solemn vows and sacred bonds of love  Now where his elves so brightly danc'd the round  No violet breathes nor daisy paints the ground  His towers and people fill one common grave  A shapeless ruin and a barren cave  Beneath huge hills of smoaking piles he lay  Stun'd and confounded a whole summer's day  At length awak'd for what can long restrain  Unbody'd spirits but awak'd in pain  And as he saw the desolated wood  And the dark den where once his empire stood  Grief chill'd his heart to his halfopen'd eyes  In every oak a Neptune seem'd to rise  He fled and left with all his trembling peers  The long possession of a thousand years  Thro' bush thro' brake thro' groves and gloomy dales  Through dank and dry o'er streams and flowery vales  Direct they fled but often look'd behind  And stop'd and started at each russling wind  Wing'd with like fear his abdicated bands  Disperse and wander into different lands  Part hid bencath the Peak's deep caverns lie  In silent glooms impervious to the sky  Part on fair Avon's margin seek repose  Whose stream o'er Britain's midmost region flows  Where formidable Neptune never came  And seas and oceans are but known by fame  Some to dark woods and secret shades retreat  And some on mountains chuse their airy seat  There haply by the ruddy damsel seen  Or shepherdboy they featly foot the green  While from their steps a circling verdure springs  But fly from towns and dread the courts of kings  Meanwhile sad Kenna loth to quit the grove  Hung o'er the body of her breathless love  Try'd every art vain arts to change his doom  And vow'd vain vows to join him in the tomb  What could she do the fates alike deny  The dead to live or fairy forms to die  An herb there grows the same old  Odyss l  Homer tells  Ulysses bore to rival Circe's spells  Its root is ebonblack but sends to light  A stem that bends with flow'rets milky white  Moly the plant which gods and fairies know  But secret kept from mortal men below  On his pale limbs it's virtuous juice she shed  And murmur'd mystick numbers o'er the dead  When lo the little shape by magick power  Grew less and less contracted to a flower  A slower that first in this sweet garden smil'd  To virgins sacred and the Snowdrop styl'd  The newborn plant with sweet regret she view'd  Warm'd with her sighs and with her tears bedew'd  It's ripen'd seeds from bank to bank convey'd  And with her lover whiten'd half the shade  Thus won from death each spring she sees him grow  And glories in the vegetable snow  Which now increas'd through wide Britannia's plains  It's parent's warmth and spotless name retains  First leader of the flowery race aspires  And foremost catches the sun's genial fires  'Mid frosts and snows triumphant dares appear  Mingles the seasons and leads on the year  Deserted now of all the pygmy race  Nor man nor fairy touch'd this guilty place  In heaps on heaps for many a rolling age  It lay accurs'd the mark of Neptune's rage  'Till great Nassau recloath'd the desart shade  Thence sacred to Britannia's monarchs made  'Twas then the greenrob'd nymph fair Kenna came  Kenna that gave the neighb'ring town it's name  Proud when she saw th' ennobled garden shine  With nymphs and heroes of her lover's line  She vow'd to grace the mansions once her own  And picture out in plants the fairy town  To farfam'd Wise her flight unseen she sped  And with gay prospects fill'd the craftsman's head  Soft in his fancy drew a pleasing scheme  And plann'd that landskip in a morning dream  With the sweet view the sire of gardens fir'd  Attempts the labour by the nymph inspir'd  The walls and streets in rows of yew designs  And forms the town in all it's ancient lines  The corner trees he lifts more high in air  And girds the palace with a verdant square  Nor knows while round he views the rising scenes  He builds a city as he plants his greens  With a sad pleasure the aerial maid  This image of her ancient realm survey'd  How chang'd how fallen from its primaeval pride  Yet here each moon the hour her lover dy'd  Each moon his solemn obsequies she pays  And leads the dance beneath pale Cynthia's rays  Pleas'd in these shades to head her fairy train  And grace the groves where Albion's kinsmen reign  AN EPISTLE from a Lady in ENGLAND TO A GENTLEMAN at AVIGNON  By the Same  TO thee dear rover and thy vanquish'd friends  The health she wants thy gentle Chloe sends  Though much you suffer think I suffer more  Worse than an exile on my native shore  Companions in your master's flight you roam  Unenvy'd by your haughty foes at home  Forever near the royal outlaw's side  You share his fortunes and his hopes divide  On glorious schemes and thoughts of empire dwell  And with imaginary titles swell  Say for thou know'st I own his sacred line  The passive doctrine and the right divine  Say what new succours does the chief prepare  The strength of armies Or the force of pray'r  Do's he from heav'n or earth his hopes derive  From saints departed Or from priests alive  Nor saints nor priests can Brunswick's troops withstand  And beads drop useless through the zealot's hand  Heav'n to our vows may future kingdoms owe  But skill and courage win the crowns below  Ere to thy cause and thee my heart inclin'd  Or love to party had seduc'd my mind  In female joys I took a dull delight  Slept all the morn and punted half the night  But now with fears and publick cares possess'd  The church the church forever breaks my rest  The postboy on my pillow I explore  And sift the news of ev'ry foreign shore  Studious to find new friends and new allies  What armies march from Sweden in disguise  How Spain prepares her banners to unfold  And Rome deals out her blessings and her gold  Then o'er the map my finger taught to stray  Cross many a region marks the winding way  From sea to sea from realm to realm I rove  And grow a mere geographer by love  But still Avignon and the pleasing coast  That holds Thee banish'd claims my care the most  Oft on the wellknown spot I fix my eyes  And span the distance that between us lies  Let not our James tho' foil'd in arms despair  Whilst on his side he reckons half the fair  In Britain's lovely isle a shining throng  War in his cause a thousand beauties strong  Th' unthinking victors vainly boast their pow'rs  Be theirs the musquet while the tongue is ours  We reason with such fluency and fire  The beaux we baffle and the learned tire  Against her prelates plead the church's cause  And from our judges vindicate the laws  Then mourn not hapless prince thy kingdoms lost  A crown tho' late thy sacred brow may boast  Heav'n seems through us thy empire to decree  Those who win hearts have giv'n their hearts to thee  Hast thou not heard that when profusely gay  Our welldress'd rivals grac'd their sov'reign's day  We stubborn damsels met the publick view  In loathsome wormwood and repenting rue  What whig but trembled when our spotless band  In virgin roses whiten'd half the land  Who can forget what fears the foe possess'd  When oaken boughs mark'd ev'ry loyal breast  Less scar'd near Medway's stream the Norman stood  When cross the plain he spy'd a marching wood  'Till near at hand a gleam of swords betray'd  The youth of Kent beneath it's wandring shade  Those who the succours of the fair despise  May find that we have nails as well as eyes  Thy female bands O prince by fortune cross'd  At least more courage than thy men may boast  Our sex has dar'd the mughouse chiefs to meet  And purchas'd fame in many a wellfought street  From Drurylane the region of renown  The land of love the Paphos of the town  Fair patriots sallying oft have put to flight  With all their poles the guardians of the night  And bore with screams of triumph to their side  The leader's staff in all its painted pride  Nor fears the hawker in her warbling note  To vend the discontented stateman's thought  Tho' red with stripes and recent from the thong  Sore smitten for the love of sacred song  The tuneful sisters still pursue their trade  Like Philomela darkling in the shade  Poor Trott attends forgetful of a fare  And hums in concert o'er his empty chair  Mean while regardless of the royal cause  His sword for James no brother sov'reign draws  The Pope himself surrounded with alarms  To France his bulls to Corfu sends his arms  And though he hears his darling son's complaint  Can hardly spare one tutelary saint  But lists them all to guard his own abodes  And into ready money coins his Gods  The dauntless Swede pursu'd by vengeful foes  Scarce keeps his own hereditary snows  Nor must the friendly roof of kind Lorrain  With feasts regale our garter'd youth again  Safe Barleduc within thy silent grove  The pheasant now may perch the hare may rove  The knight who aims unerring from afar  Th' advent'rous knight now quits the sylvan war  The brinded boars may slumber undismay'd  Or grunt secure beneath the chesnut shade  Inconstant Orleans still we mourn the day  That trusted Orleans with imperial sway  Far o'er the Alps our helpless monarch sends  Far from the call of his desponding friends  Such are the terms to gain Britannia's grace  And such the terrors of the Brunswick race  Was it for this the sun's whole lustre fail'd  And sudden midnight o'er the noon prevail'd  For this did heav'n display to mortal eyes  Aërial knights and combats in the skies  Was it for this Northumbrian streams look'd red  And Thames driv'n backward show'd his secret bed  False Auguries th' insulting victor's scorn  Ev'n our own prodigies against us turn  O portents constru'd on our side in vain  Let never Tory trust eclipse again  Run clear ye fountains be at peace ye skies  And Thames henceforth to thy green borders rise  To Rome then must the royal wand'rer go  And fall a suppliant at the papal toe  His life in sloth inglorious must he wear  One halfin luxury and one in pray'r  His mind perhaps at length debauch'd with ease  The proffer'd purple and the hat may please  Shall he whose ancient patriarchal race  To mighty Nimrod in one line we trace  In solemn conclave sit devoid of thought  And poll for points of faith his trusty vote  Be summon'd to his stall in time of need  And with his casting suffrage fix a creed  Shall he in robes on stated days appear  And English hereticks curse once a year  Garnet and Faux shall he with pray'rs invoke  And beg that Smithfield piles once more may smoak  Forbid it heaven my soul to fury wrought  Turns almost Hanoverian at the thought  From James and Rome I feel my heart decline  And fear O Brunswick 'twill be wholly thine  Yet still his share thy rival will contest  And still the double claim divides my breast  The fate of James with pitving eyes I view  And wish my homage were not Brunswick's due  To James my passions and my weakness guide  But reason sways me to the victor's side  Though griev'd I speak it let the truth appear  You know my language and my heart sincere  In vain did falshood his fair fame disgrace  What force had falshood when he show'd his face  In vain to war our boastful clans were led  Heaps driv'n on heaps in the dire shock they fled  France shuns his wrath nor raises to our shame  A second Dunkirk in another name  in Britain's funds their wealth all Europe throws  And up the Thames the world's abundance flows  Spite of feign'd fears and artificial cries  The pious town sees fifty churches rise  The hero triumphs as his worth is known  And sits more firmly on his shaken throne  To my sad thought no beam of hope appears  Through the long prospect of succeeding years  The son aspiring to his father's fame  Shows all his sire another and the same  He blest in lovely Carolina's arms  To future ages propagates her charms  With pain and joy at strife I often trace  The mingled parents in each daughter's face  Half sick'ning at the sight too well I spie  The father's spirit through the mother's eye  In vain new thoughts of rage I entertain  And strive to hate their innocence in vain  O princess happy by thy foes confess'd  Blest in thy husband in thy children blest  As they from thee from them new beauties born  While Europe lasts shall Europe's thrones adorn  Transplanted to each court in times to come  Thy smile celestial and unfading bloom  Great Austria's sons with softer lines shall grace  And smooth the frowns of Bourbon's haughty race  The fair descendents of thy sacred bed  Widebranching o'er the Western world shall spread  Like the fam'd Banian tree whose pliant shoot  To earthward bending of it self takes root  Till like their mother plant ten thousand stand  In verdant arches on the fertile land  Beneath her shade the tawny Indians rove  Or hunt at large through the wide echoing grove  O thou to whom these mournful lines I send  My promis'd husband and my dearest friend  Since heav'n appoints this favour'd race to reign  And blood has drench'd the Scottish fields in vain  Must I be wretched and thy flight partake  Or wilt not thou for thy lov'd Chloe's sake  Tir'd out at length submit to fate's decree  If not to Brunswick O return to me  Prostrate before the victor's mercy bend  What spares whole thousands may to thee extend  Should blinded friends thy doubtful conduct blame  Great Brunswick's virtues will secure thy fame  Say these invite thee to approach his throne  And own the monarch heav'n vouchsafes to own  The world convinc'd thy reasons will approve  Say this to Them but swear to Me 'twas love  THE FEMALE REIGN AN ODE  By Mr COBB  I  WHAT can the British senate give  To make the name of ANNA live  By future people to be sung  The labour of each grateful tongue  Can faithful registers or rhyme  In charming eloquence or sprightly wit  The wonders of her reign transmit  To th'unborn children of succeeding time  Can painter's oil or statuary's art  Eternity to her impart  No titled statues are but empty things  Inscrib'd to royal vanity  The sacrifice of flattery  To lawless Neros or Bourbonian kings  True virtue to her kindred stars aspires  Does all our pomp of stone and verse surpass  And mingling with etherial fires  No useless ornament requires  From speaking colours or from breathing brass  II  Greatest of princes where the wand'ring sun  Does o'er earth's habitable regions roll  From th' eastern barr'ers to the western goal  And sees thy race of glory run  With swiftness equal to his own  Thee on the banks of Flandrian Scaldis sings  The jocund swain releas'd from Gallic fear  The English voice unus'd to hear  Thee the repeating banks thee ev'ry valley rings  III  The sword of heav'n how pious ANNA wields  And heav'nly vengeance on the guilty deals  Let the twice fugitive Bavarian tell  Who from his airy hope of better state  By lust of sway irregularly great  Like an apostate angel fell  Who by imperial favour rais'd  I'th' highest rank of glory blaz'd  And had till now unrival'd shone  More than a king contented with his own  But Lucifer's bold steps he trod  Who durst assault the throne of GOD  And for contented realms of blissful light  Gain'd the sad privilege to be  The first in solid misery  Monarch of hell and woes and everlasting night  Corruption of the best is always worst  And foul ambition like an evil wind  Blights the fair blossoms of a noble mind  And if a seraph fall he's doubly curst  IV  Had guile and pride and envy grown  In the black groves of Styx alone  Nor ever had on earth the baleful crop been sown  The swain without amaze had till'd  The Flandrian glebe a guiltless field  Nor had he wonder'd when he found  The bones of heroes in the ground  No crimson streams had lately swell'd  The Dyle the Danube and the Scheld  But evils are of necessary growth  To rouze the brave and banish sloth  And some are born to win the stars  By sweat and blood and worthy scars  Heroick virtue is by action seen  And vices serve to make it keen  And as gigantick tyrants rise  NASSAUS and CHURCHILLS leave the skies  The earthborn monsters to chastise  V  If heav'nly muse you burn with a desire  To praise the man whom all admire  Come from thy learn'd Castalian springs  And stretch aloft thy Pegasean wings  Strike the loud Pindarick strings  Like the lark who soars and sings  And as you sail the liquid skies  Cast on  The Menapii were the ancient inhabitants of Flanders  Menapian fields your weeping eyes  For weep they surely must  To see the bloody annual sacrifice  To think how the neglected dust  Which with contempt is basely trod  Was once the limbs of captains brave and just  The mortal part of some great Demigod  Who for thrice fifty years of stubborn war  With slaught'ring arms the gun and sword  Have dug the mighty sepulchre  And fell as martyrs on record  Of tyranny aveng'd and liberty restor'd  VI  See where at Audenard with heaps of slain  Th' heroick man inspir'dly brave  Mowing across bestrews the plain  And with new tenants crowds the wealthy grave  His mind unshaken at the frightful scene  His looks as chearfully serene  The routed battle to pursue  At once adorn'd the Paphian queen  When to her Thracian paramour she flew  The gath'ring troops he kens from far  And with a bridegroom's passion and delight  Courting the war and glowing for the fight  The new Salmoneus meets the Celtic thunderer  Ah cursed pride infernal dream  Which drove him to this wild extream  That dust a deity should seem  Be thought as through the wond'ring streets he rode  A man immortal or a god  With rattling brass and trampling horse  Should counterfeit th' inimitable force  Of divine thunder horrid crime  But vengeance is the child of time  And will too surely be repay'd  On his profane devoted head  Who durst affront the pow'rs above  And their eternal flames disgrace  Too fatal brandish'd by the real Jove  Or  VICEM GERIT ILLA TONANTIS  Pallas who assumes and fills his awful place  VII  The British Pallas who as  Homer in his fifth  Iliad  because his hero is to do wonders beyond the power of man premises in the begin+ning that Pallas had peculiarly fitted him for that day's exploits  Homer's did  For her lov'd Diomede  Her hero's mind with wisdom fills  And heav'nly courage in his heart instils  Hence thro' the thickest squadrons does he ride  With ANNA's angels by his side  With what uncommon speed  He spurs his foaming fiery steed  And pushes on thro' midmost fires  Where France's fortune with her sons retires  Now here now there the sweeping ruin flies  Indomitas prope qualis undas  Exercit auster pleiadum choro  Scindente nubes impiger hostium  Vexare turmas frementem  Mittere equum medios per ignes  Sic tauriformis volvitur Aufidus  Qui regna D  uni praefluit Appuli  Cum saevit horrendam quo cultis  Diluviem meditatur agris  As when the Pleiades arise  The southern wind afflicts the skies  Then mutt'ring o'er the deep buffets th' unruly brine  'Till clouds and water seem to join  Or as a dyke cut by malicious hands  O'erflows the fertile Netherlands  Thro' the wide yawn th' impetuous sea  Lavish of his new liberty  Bestrides the vale and with tumultuous noise  Bellows along the delug'd plain  Pernicious to the rip'ning grain  Far as th' horizon he destroys  The weeping shepherd from an hill bewails the wat'ry reign  VIII  So rapid flows the unimprison'd stream  So strong the force of MINDELHEIM  In vain the woods of Audenard  Would shield the Gaul a fenceless guard  As soon may whirlwinds be withheld  As MARLBRO's footsteps o'er the foaming Scheld  In vain the torrent would oppose  In vain arm'd banks and hosts of foes  The foes with cowardhaste retire  Fly faster than the river flows  And swifter than our fire  Vendosme from far upbraids their shame  And pleads his royal master's fame  "By Condè's mighty ghost" he cries  "By Turenne Luxemburgh and all  "Those noble souls who fell a sacrifice  "At  Near this place the prince of Condè gave the Spaniards a very great overthrow  Lens at Fleurus and at Landen sight  "Stop I conjure your ignominious flight"  But fear is deaf to honour's call  Each frowning threat and soothing pray'r  Is lost in the regardless air  As well he may  The billows of the ocean stay  While CHURCHILL like a driving wind  Or high springtide pursues behind  And with redoubled speed urges their forward way  IX  Nor less EUGENIUS thy important care  Thou second thunderbolt of war  Partner in danger and in fame  The wind with MARLBOROUGH's shall bear  To distant colonies thy conqu'ring name  Nor shall my muse forget to sing  From harmony what blessings spring  To tell how death did enviously repine  To see a friendship so divine  When in a ball's destroying form she past  And mark'd thy threaten'd brow at last  But durst not touch that sacred brain  Where Europe's mightiest counsels reign  For strait she bow'd her ghastly head  She saw the mark of heav'n and fled  As cruel Brennus once insulting Gaul  When he at Allia's fatal flood  Had fill'd the plains with Roman blood  With conscious awe forsook the capitol  Where Jove revenger of profaneness stood  X  But where the good and brave command  What capitol what bulwark can withstand  Virtue approv'd of heav'n can pass  Thro' walls thro' tow'rs and gates of brass  Lisle like a mistress had been courted long  By all the valiant and the young  The fairest progeny of Vauban's art  'Till SAVOY's warlike prince withstood  Her frowning terrors and thro' seas of blood  Tore the bright darling from th' old tyrant's heart  Such  He bore a considerable share in the glory of that day on which Buda was taken  Buda saw him when proud  He was Bassau of the city and lost his life on the breach  Apti fell  Unhappy valiant infidel  Who vanquish'd by superior strength  Surrender'd up his haughty breath  Upon the breach measuring his manly length  And shun'd the bowstring by a nobler death  XI  Such  This was the fatal battle to the Turks in the year Prince Eugene with the regiments of his brigade was the first that enter'd the trenches and for that reason had the honour to be the first messenger of this happy news to the emperor  Harscam's field beheld him in his bloom  When victory bespoke him for her own  Her favourite immortal son  And told of better years revolving on the loom  How he should make the Turkish crescent wane  And choak  This battle was fought on the th of October where prince Eugene commanded in chief like which there never happen'd so great and so terrible a destruction to the Ottoman army which fell upon the principal commanders more than the common soldiers for no less than fifteen Bassaus five of which had been Viziers of the bench were killed besides the supreme Vizier  Tibiscus with the slain  While Viziers lay beneath the lofty pile  Of slaughter'd Bassaus who o'er Bassaus roll'd  And all his num'rous acts she told  From Latian Carpi down to Flandrian Lisle  XII  Honour with open arms receives at last  The heroes who thro' virtue's temple past  And show'rs down laurels from above  On those whom heav'n and ANNA love  And some not sparingly she throws  For the young eagles who could try  The faith and judgment of the sky  And dare the sun with steady eye  For Hanover's and Prussia's brows  Eugenes in bloom and future Marlboroughs  To Hanover to Brunswick's second grace  Descendent from a long imperial race  The muse directs her honourable flight  And prophesies from so serene a morn  To what clear glories he is born  When blazing with a full meridian light  He shall the British hemisphere adorn  When Mars shall lay his batter'd target down  And he since death will never spare  The good the pious and the fair  In his ripe harvest of renown  Shall after his great father sit  If heav'n so long a life permit  And having swell'd the flowing tide  Of fame which he in arms shall get  The purchase of an honest sweat  Shall safe in stormy seas Britannia's vessel guide  XIII  Britannia's vessel which in ANNA's reign  And prudent pilotry enjoys  The tempest which the world destroys  And rides triumphant o'er the subject main  O may she soon a quiet harbour gain  And sure the promis'd hour is come  When in soft notes the peaceful lyre  Shall still the trumpet and the drum  Shall play what gods and men desire  And strike Bellona's musick dumb  When war by parents curs'd shall quit the field  Unbuckle his bright helmet and to rest  His weary'd limbs sit on his idle shield  With scars of honour plow'd upon his breast  But if the Gallic Pharaoh's stubborn heart  Grows fresh for punishment and hardens still  Prepar'd for th' irrecoverable ill  And force th' unwilling skies to act the last ungrateful part  Thy forces ANNA like a flood shall whelm  If heav'n does scepter'd innocence maintain  His famish'd desolated realm  And all the sons of Pharamond in vain  Who with dishonest envy see  The sweet forbidden fruits of distant liberty  Shall curse their Salic law and wish a female reign  XIV  A female reign like thine  O ANNA British heroine  To thee afflicted empires fly for aid  Where'er tyrannick standards are display'd  From the wrong'd Iber to the threaten'd Rhine  Thee where the goldensanded Tagus flows  Beneath fair  The old name of Lishon said to be built by Ulysses  Ulyssippo's walls  The frighted Lusitanian calls  Thee they who drink the Sein with those  Who plow Iberian fields implore  To give the lab'ring world repose  And universal peace restore  Thee Gallia mournful to sruvive the fate  Of her fall'n grandeur and departed state  By sad experience taught to own  That virtue is a nobler way to rise  A surer passage to the skies  Than Pelion upon Ossa thrown  For they who impiously presume  To grasp at heav'n by JOVE's eternal doom  A prey to thunder shall become  Or sent in  One of the mountains where Jupiter lodged the giants  Aetna's fiery caves to groan  Gain but an higher fall a mountain for their tomb  SIX TOWN ECLOGUES  By the Right Hon L  M W M  MONDAY ROXANA or The DrawingRoom  ROXANA from

tatter'd ridinghoods alone could sin  The happier sinners now their charms put out  And to their manteaus their complexions suit  The opera queens had finish'd half their faces  And citydames already taken places  Fops of all kinds to see the Lion run  The beauties stay till the first act's begun  And beaux step home to put fresh linen on  No welldress'd youth in coffeehouse remain'd  But pensive PATCH who on the window lean'd  And SILLIANDER that alert and gay  First pick'd his teeth and then began to say  SILLIANDER  Why all these sighs ah why so pensive grown  Some cause there is why thus you sit alone  Does hapless passion all this sorrow move  Or dost thou envy where the ladies love  PATCH  If whom they love my envy must pursue  'Tis sure at least I never envy you  SILLIANDER  No I'm unhappy you are in the right  'Tis you they favour and 'tis me they slight  Ye I cou'd tell but that I hate to boast  A club of ladies where 'tis me they toast  PATCH  Toasting does seldom any favour prove  Like us they never toast the thing they love  A certain duke one night my health begun  With chearful pledges round the room it run  Till the young SYLVIA press'd to drink it too  Started and vow'd she knew not what to do  What drink a fellow's health she dy'd with shame  Yet blush'd whenever she pronounc'd my name  SILLIANDER  Ill fates pursue me may I never find  The dice propitious or

 And as for presentslook upon my shoe  These buckles were not forc'd nor half a theft  But a young countess fondly made the gift  PATCH  My countess is more nice more artful too  Affects to fly that I may fierce pursue  This snuffbox which I begg'd she still deny'd  And when I strove to snatch it seem'd to hide  She laugh'd and fled and as I sought to seize  With affection cram'd it down her slays  Yet hop'd she did not place it there unseen  I press'd her breasts and pull'd it from between  SILLIANDER  Last night as I stood ogling of her grace  Drinking delicious poison from her face  The soft enchantress did that face decline  Nor ever rais'd her eyes to meet with mine  With sudden art some secret did pretend  Lean'd cross two chairs to whisper to a friend  While the stiff whalebone with

my care and mitigate my pain  "If all my sighs my cares can fail to move  "Ah sooth me not with fruitless vows of love"  Thus STREPHON spoke DANCINDA thus reply'd  What must I do to gratify your pride  Too well you know ungrateful as thou art  How much you triumph in this tender heart  What proof of love remains for me to grant  Yet still you teaze me with some new complaint  Oh would to heav'nbut the fond wish is vain  Too many favours had not made it plain  But such a passion breaks thro' all disguise  Love reddens on my cheek and wishes in my eyes  Is't not enough inhuman and unkind  I own the secret conflict of my mind  You cannot know what secret pain I prove  When I with burning blushes own I love  You see my artless joy at your approach  I sigh I faint I tremble at your touch  And in your absence all the world I shun  I hate mankind and curse the cheering sun  Still as I fly ten thousand swains pursue  Ten thousand swains I sacrifice to you  I shew you all my heart without disguise  But these are tender proofs that you despise  I see too well what wishes you pursue  You wou'd not only conquer but undo  You cruel victor weary of your flame  Would seek a cure in my eternal shame  And not content my honour to subdue  Now strive to triumph o'er my virtue too  Oh LOVE a God indeed to womankind  Whose arrows burn me and whose fetters bind  Avenge thy altars vindicate thy fame  And blast these traytors that profane thy name  Who by pretending to thy sacred fire  Raise cursed trophies to impure desire  Have you forgot with what ensnaring art  You first seduc'd this fond uncautious heart  Then as I fled did you not kneeling cry  Turn cruel beauty whither wou'd you fly  Why all these doubts why this distrustful fear  No impious wishes shall offend your ear  Nor ever shall my boldest hopes pretend  Above the title of a tender friend  Blest if my lovely goddess will permit  My humble vows thus sighing at her feet  The tyrant love that in my bosom reigns  The God himself submits to wear your chains  You shall direct his course his ardour tame  And check the fury of his wildest slame  Unpractis'd youth is easily deceiv'd  Sooth'd by such sounds I listen'd and believ'd  Now quite forgot that soft submissive fear  You dare to ask what I must blush to hear  Cou'd I forget the honour of my race  And meet your wishes fearless of disgrace  Cou'd passion o'er my tender youth prevail  And all my mother's pious maxims fail  Yet to preserve your heart which still must be  False as it is for ever dear to me  This fatal proof of love I would not give  Which you'd contemn the moment you receive  The wretched she who yields to guilty joys  A man may pity but he must despise  Your ardour ceas'd I then shou'd see you shun  The wretched victim by your arts undone  Yet if I cou'd that cold indifference bear  What more wou'd strike me with the last despair  With this reflection wou'd my soul be torn  To know I merited your cruel scorn  Has love no pleasures free from guilt or fear  Pleasures less fierce more lasting more sincere  Thus let us gently kiss and fondly gaze  Love is a child and like a child it plays  O STREPHON if you wou'd continue just  If love be something more than brutal lust  Forbear to ask what I must still deny  This bitter pleasure this destructive joy  So closely follow'd by the dismal train  Of cutting shame and guilt's heartpiercing pain  She paus'd and fix'd her eyes upon her fan  He took a pinch of snuff and thus began  Madam if lovebut he cou'd say no more  For Mademoiselle came rapping at the door  The dangerous moments no adieus afford  Begone she cries I'm sure I hear my lord  The lover starts from his unfinish'd loves  To snatch his hat and seek his scatter'd gloves  The sighing dame to meet her dear prepares  While STREPHON cursing slips down the backstairs  THURSDAY The BASSETTETABLE  SMILINDA and CARDELIA  CARDELIA  THE bassettetable spread the tallier come  Why stays SMILINDA in the dressingroom  Rise pensive nymph the tallier stays for you  SMILINDA  Ah Madam since my SHARPER is untrue  I joyless make my once ador'd alpieu  I saw him stand behind OMBRELIA's chair  And whisper with that soft deluding air  And those feign'd sighs that cheat the list'ning fair  CARDELIA  Is this the cause of your romantick strains  A mightier grief my heavy heart sustains  As you by love so I by fortune cross'd  In one bad deal three Septlevas I lost  SMILINDA  Is that a grief which you compare with mine  With ease the smiles of fortune I resign  Wou'd all my gold in one bad deal were gone  Were lovely SHARPER mine and mine alone  CARDELIA  A lover lost is but a common care  And prudent nymphs against the change prepare  The queen of clubs thrice lost oh who cou'd guess  This fatal stroke this unforeseen distress  SMILINDA  See BETTY LOVEIT very à propos  She all the pains of love and play does know  Deeply experienc'd many years ago  Dear BETTY shall th' important point decide  BETTY who oft the pains of each has try'd  Impartial she shall say who suffers most  By cards' illusage or by lovers lost  LOVEIT  Tell tell your griefs attentive will I stay  Tho' time is precious and I want some tea  CARDELIA  Behold this equipage by MATHERS wrought  With fifty guineas a great pen'orth bought  See on the toothpick MARS and CUPID strive  And both the struggling figures seem to live  Upon the bottom see the Queen's bright face  A myrtle foliage round the thimble case  JOVE JOVE himself doe on the scissars shine  The metal and the workmanship divine  SMILINDA  This snuffbox once the pledge of SHARPER's love  When rival beauties for the present strove  At CORTICELLI's he the raffle won  There first his passion was in publick shown  HAZARDIA blush'd and turn'd her head aside  Her rival's envy all in vain to hide  This snuffboxon the hinge see diamonds shine  This snuffbox will I stake the prize is mine  CARDELIA  Alas far smaller losses than I bear  Have made a soldier sigh a lover swear  But oh what makes the disappointment hard  'Twas my own lord who drew the fatal card  In complaisance I took the queen he gave  Tho' my own secret wish was for the knave  The knave won  son ecart  that I had chose  And the next pull my  septleva  I lose  SMILINDA  But ah what aggravates the killing smart  The cruel thought that stabs me to the heart  This curs'd OMBRELIA this undoing fair  By whose vile arts this heavy grief I bear  She at whose name I shed these spiteful tears  She owes to me the very charms she wears  An aukward thing when first she came to town  Her shape unfinish'd and her face unknown  She was my friend I taught her first to spread  Upon her sallow cheeks enlivening red  I introduc'd her to the park and plays  And by my int'rest COSINS made her stays  Ungrateful wretch with mimick airs grown pert  She dares to steal my favourite lover's heart  CARDELIA  Wretch that I was how often have I swore  When WINNALL tallied I would punt no more  I know the bite yet to my ruin run  And see the folly which I cannot shun  SMILINDA  How many maids have SHARPER's vows deceiv'd  How many curs'd the moment they believ'd  Yet his known falshood could no warning prove  Ah what are warnings to a maid in love  CARDELIA  But of what marble must that breast be form'd  Can gaze on Bassette and remain unwarm'd  When kings queens knaves are set in decent rank  Expos'd in glorious heaps the tempting bank  Guineas halfguineas all the shining train  The winner's pleasure and the loser's pain  In bright confusion open rouleaus lie  They strike the soul and glitter in the eye  Fir'd by the sight all reason I disdain  My passions rise and will not bear the rein  Look upon Bassette you who reason boast  And see if reason may not there be lost  SMILINDA  What more than marble must that breast compose  That listens coldly to my SHARPER's vows  Then when he trembles when his blushes rise  When awful love seems melting in his eyes  With eager beats his Mechlin cravat moves  He loves I whisper to myself he loves  Such unfeign'd passion in his look appears  I lose all mem'ry of my former fears  My panting heart confesses all his charms  I yield at once and sink into his arms  Think of that moment you who prudence boast  For such a moment prudence well were lost  CARDELIA  At the groomporter's batter'd bullies play  Some dukes at Marybon bowl time away  But who the bowl or rattling dice compares  To Bassette's heavenly joys and pleasing cares  SMILINDA  Soft SIMPLICETTA doats upon a beau  PRUDINA likes a man and laughs at show  Their several graces in my SHARPER meet  Strong as the footman as the master sweet  LOVEIT  Cease your contention which has been too long  I grow impatient and the tea grows strong  Attend and yield to what I now decide  The equipage shall grace SMILINDA's side  The snuffbox to CARDELIA I decree  So leave complaining and begin your tea  FRIDAY The TOILETTE  LYDIA  NOW twenty springs had cloath'd the park with green  Since LYDIA knew the blossom of fifteen  No lovers now her morning hours molest  And catch her at her toilette half undrest  The thund'ring knocker wakes the street no more  Nor chairs nor coaches crowd the silent door  Now at the window all her mornings pass  Or at the dumb devotion of her glass  Reclin'd upon her arm she pensive sate  And curs'd th' inconstancy of man too late  "Oh youth O spring of life for ever lost  "No more my name shall reign the fav'rite toast  "On glass no more the diamond grave my name  "And lines misspelt record my lover's flame  "Nor shall sideboxes watch my wand'ring eyes  "And as they catch the glance in rows arise  "With humble bows nor whiteglov'd beaus encroach  "In crowds behind to guard me to my coach  "What shall I do to spend the hateful day  "At chapel shall I wear the morn away  "Who there appears at these unmodish hours  "But ancient matrons with their frizled tow'rs  "And grey religious maids my presence there  "Amidst that sober train would own despair  "Nor am I yet so old nor is my glance  "As yet fix'd wholly on devotion's trance  "Strait then I'll dress and take my wonted range  "Thro' India shops to Motteux's or the Change  "Where the tall jar erects its stately pride  "With antick shapes in China's azure dy'd  "There careless lies a rich brocade unroll'd  "Here shines a cabinet with burnish'd gold  "But then alas I must be forc'd to pay  "And bring no penn'orths not a fan away  "How am I curs'd unhappy and forlorn  "My lover's triumph and my sex's scorn  "False is the pompous grief of youthful heirs  "False are the loose coquet's inveigling airs  "False is the crafty courtier's plighted word  "False are the dice when gamesters stamp the board  "False is the sprightly widow's publick tear  "Yet these to DAMON's oaths are all sincere  "For what young flirt base man am I abus'd  "To please your wife am I unkindly us'd  "'Tis true her face may boast the peach's bloom  "But does her nearer whisper breathe perfume  "I own her taper shape is form'd to please  "But don't you see her unconfin'd by stays  "She doubly to fifteen may claim pretence  "Alike we read it in her face and sense  "Insipid servile thing whom I disdain  "Her phlegm can best support the marriage chain  "DAMON is practis'd in the modish life  "Can hate and yet be civil to his wife  "He games he drinks he swears he fights he roves  "Yet CLOE can believe he fondly loves  "Mistress and Wife by turns supply his need  "A miss for pleasure and a wife for breed  "Powder'd with diamonds free from spleen or care  "She can a sullen husband's humour bear  "Her credulous friendship and her stupid ease  "Have often been my jest in happier days  "Now CLOE boasts and triumphs in my pains  "To her he's faithful 'tis to me he feigns  "Am I that stupid thing to bear neglect  "And force a smile not daring to suspect  "No perjured man a Wife may be content  "But you shall find a Mistress can resent"  Thus lovesick LYDIA rav'd her maid appears  And in her faithful hand the band box bears  The Cestos that reform'd inconstant JOVE  Not better fill'd with what allur'd to love  "How well this ribband's gloss becomes your face"  She cries in rapture "then so sweet a lace  "How charmingly you look so bright so fair  "'Tis to your eyes the headdress owes its air"  Strait LYDIA smil'd the comb adjusts her locks  And at the playhouse HARRY keeps her box  SATURDAY The SMALLPOX  FLAVIA  THE wretched FLAVIA on her couch reclin'd  Thus breath'd the anguish of a wounded mind  A glass revers'd in her right hand she bore  For now she shunn'd the face she sought before  "How am I chang'd alas how am I grown  'A frightful spectre to myself unknown  'Where's my complexion where my radiant bloom  'That promis'd happiness for years to come  'Then with what pleasure I this face survey'd  'To look once more my visits oft delay'd  'Charm'd with the view a fresher red would rise  'And a new life shot sparkling from my eyes  'Ah faithless glass my wonted bloom restore  'Alas I rave that bloom is now no more  'The greatest good the Gods on men bestow  'Ev'n youth itself to me is useless now  'There was a time oh that I cou'd forget  'When operatickets pour'd before my feet  'And at the ring where brightest beauties shine  'The earliest cherries of the spring were mine  'Witness O Lilly and thou Motteux tell  'How much japan these eyes have made ye sell  'With what contempt ye saw me oft despise  'The humble offer of the raffled prize  'For at the raffle still each prize I bore  'With scorn rejected or with triumph wore  'Now beauty's fled and presents are no more  'For me the Patriot has the house forsook  'And left debates to catch a passing look  'For me the Soldier has soft verses writ  'For me the Beau has aim'd to be a wit  'For me the Wit to nonsense was betray'd  'The Gamester has for me his dun delay'd  'And overseen the card I would have pay'd  'The bold and haughty by success made vain  'Aw'd by my eyes have trembled to complain  'The bashful 'Squire touch'd by a wish unknown  'Has dar'd to speak with spirit not his own  'Fir'd by one wish all did alike adore  'Now beauty's fled and lovers are no more  'As round the room I turn my weeping eyes  'New unaffected scenes of sorrow rise  'Far from my sight that killing picture bear  'The face disfigure and the canvas tear  'That picture which with pride I us'd to show  'The lost resemblance but upbraids me now  'And thou my toilette where I oft have sate  'While hours unheeded pass'd in deep debate  'How curls should fall or where a patch to place  'If blue or scarlet best became my face  'Now on some happier nymph your aid bestow  'On fairer heads ye useless jewels glow  'No borrow'd lusture can my charms restore  'Beauty is fled and dress is now no more  'Ye meaner beauties I permit ye shine  'Go triumph in the hearts that once were mine  'But 'midst your triumphs with confusion know  ''Tis to my ruin all your arms ye owe  'Would pitying heav'n restore my wonted mein  'Ye still might move unthoughtof and unseen  'But oh how vain how wretched is the boast  'Of beauty faded and of empire lost  'What now is left but weeping to deplore  'My beauty fled and empire now no more  'Ye cruel chymists what withheld your aid  'Could no pomatums save a trembling maid  'How false and trifling is that art ye boast  'No art can give me back my beauty lost  'In tears surrounded by my friends I lay  'Mask'd o'er and trembled at the sight of day  'MIRMILIO came my fortune to deplore  'A goldenheaded cane well carv'd he bore  'Cordials he cry'd my spirits must restore  'Beauty is fled and spirit is no more  'GALEN the grave officious SQUIRT was there  'With fruitless grief and unavailing care  'MACHAON too the great MACHAON known  'By his red cloak and his superior frown  'And why he cry'd this grief and this despair  'You shall again be well again be fair  'Believe my oath with that an oath he swore  'False was his oath my beauty is no more  'Cease hapless maid no more thy tale pursue  'Forsake mankind and bid the world adieu  'Monarchs and beauties rule with equal sway  'All strive to serve and glory to obey  'Alike unpitied when depos'd they grow  'Men mock the idol of their former vow  'Adieu ye parksin some obscure recess  'Where gentle streams will weep at my distress  'Where no false friend will in my grief take part  'And mourn my ruin with a joyful heart  'There let me live in some deserted place  'There hide in shades this lost inglorious face  'Ye operas circles I no more must view  'My toilette patches all the world adieu  EPISTLE from ARTHUR GREY the Footman after his Condemnation for attempting a Rape  By the Same  READ lovely nymph and tremble not to read  I have no more to wish nor you to dread  I ask not life for life to me were vain  And death a refuge from severer pain  My only hope in these last lines I try  I would be pitied and I then would die  Long had I liv'd as sordid as my fate  Nor curs'd the destiny that made me wait  A servile slave content with homely food  The gross instinct of appetite pursued  Youth gave me sleep at night and warmth of blood  Ambition yet had never touch'd my breast  My lordly master knew no sounder rest  With labour healthy in obedience blest  But when I sawoh had I never seen  That wounding softness that engaging mein  The mist of wretched education flies  Shame fear desire despair and love arise  The new creation of those beauteous eyes  But yet that love pursued no guilty aim  Deep in my heart I hid the secret flame  I never hop'd my fond desire to tell  And all my wishes were to serve you well  Heav'ns how I flew when wing'd by your command  And kiss'd the letters giv'n me by your hand  How pleas'd how proud how fond was I to wait  Present the sparkling wine or change the plate  How when you sung my soul devour'd the sound  And every sense was in the rapture drown'd  Tho' bid to go I quite forgot to move  You knew not that stupidity was love  But oh the torment not to be express'd  The grief the rage the hell that fir'd this breast  When my great rivals in embroid'ry gay  Sate by your side or led you from the play  I still contriv'd near as I could to stand  The flambeau trembling in my shaking hand  I saw or thought I saw those fingers press'd  For thus their passion by my own I guess'd  And jealous fury all my soul possess'd  Like torrents love and indignation meet  And madness wou'd have thrown me at your feet  Turn lovely nymph for so I wou'd have said  Turn from those triflers who make love a trade  This is true passion in my eyes you see  They cannot nothey cannot love like me  Frequent debauch has pall'd their sickly taste  Faint their desire and in a moment past  They sigh not from the heart but from the brain  Vapours of vanity and strong champagne  Too dull to feel what forms like yours inspire  After long talking of their painted fire  To some lewd brothel they at night retire  There pleas'd with fancy'd quality and charms  Enjoy your beauties in a strumpet's arms  Such are the joys those toasters have in view  And such the wit and pleasure they pursue  And is this love that ought to merit you  Each operanight a new address begun  They swear to thousands what they swear to one  Not thus I sighbut all my sighs are vain  Die wretched ARTHUR and conceal thy pain  'Tis impudence to wish and madness to complain  Fix'd on this view my only hope of ease  I waited not the aid of slow disease  The keenest instruments of death I sought  And death alone employ'd my lab'ring thought  This all the nightwhen I remember well  The charming tinkle of your morning bell  Fir'd by the sound I hasten'd with your tea  With one last look to smooth the darksome way  But oh how dear that fatal look has cost  In that fond moment my resolves were lost  Hence all my guilt and all your sorrows rise  I saw the languid softness of your eyes  I saw the dear disorder of your bed  Your cheek all glowing with a tempting red  Your nightcloaths tumbled with resistless grace  Your flowing hair play'd careless round your face  Your nightgown fasten'd with a single pin  Fancy improv'd the wond'rous charms within  I fix'd my eyes upon that heaving breast  And hardly hardly I forbore the rest  Eager to gaze unsatisfy'd with sight  My head grew giddy with the near delight  Too well you know the fatal following night  Th' extremest proof of my desire I give  And since you will not love I will not live  Condemn'd by you I wait the righteous doom  Careless and fearless of the woes to come  But when you see me waver in the wind  My guilty flame extinct my soul resign'd  Sure you may pity what you can't approve  The cruel consequence of furious love  Think the bold wretch that cou'd so greatly dare  Was tender faithful ardent and sincere  Think when I held the pistol to your breast  Had I been of the world's large rule possess'd  That world had then been yours and I been blest  Think that my life was quite below my care  Nor fear'd I any hell beyond despair  If these reflections tho' they seize you late  Give some compassion for your ARTHUR's fate  Enough you give nor ought I to complain  You pay my pangs nor have I dy'd in vain  The LOVER A BALLAD To Mr C  By the Same  I  AT length by so much importunity press'd  Take C at once the inside of my breast  This stupid indiff'rence so often you blame  Is not owing to nature to fear or to shame  I am not as cold as a virgin in lead  Nor is Sunday's sermon so strong in my head  I know but too well how Time flies along  That we live but few years and yet fewer are young  II  But I hate to be cheated and never will buy  Long years of repentance for moments of joy  Oh was there a man but where shall I find  Good sense and good nature so equally join'd  Wou'd value his pleasure contribute to mine  Not meanly would boast nor would lewdly design  Not over severe yet not stupidly vain  For I would have the power tho' not give the pain  III  No pedant yet learned not rakehelly gay  Or laughing because he has nothing to say  To all my whole sex obliging and free  Yet never be fond of any but me  In publick preserve the decorum that's just  And shew in his eyes he is true to his trust  Then rarely approach and respectfully bow  But not fulsomely pert or foppishly low  IV  But when the long hours of publick are past  And we meet with champagne and a chicken at last  May ev'ry fond pleasure that moment endear  Be banish'd afar both discretion and fear  Forgetting or scorning the airs of the crowd  He may cease to be formal and I to be proud  Till lost in the joy we confess that we live  And he may be rude and yet I may forgive  V  And that my delight may be solidly fix'd  Let the friend and the lover be handsomely mix'd  In whose tender bosom my soul may confide  Whose kindness can sooth me whose counsel can guide  From such a dear lover as here I describe  No danger should fright me no millions should bribe  But till this astonishing creature I know  As I long have liv'd chaste I will keep myself so  VI  I never will share with the wanton coquet  Or be caught by a vain affectation of wit  The toasters and songsters may try all their art  But never shall enter the pass of my heart  I loath the lewd rake the dress'd fopling despise  Before such pursuers the nice virgin flies  And as OVID has sweetly in parables told  We harden like trees and like rivers grow cold  The LADY's RESOLVE Written Extempore on a Window  By the Same  WHilst thirst of praise and vain desire of fame  In ev'ry age is ev'ry woman's aim  With courtship pleas'd of silly toasters proud  Fond of a train and happy in a crowd  On each poor fool bestowing some kind glance  Each conquest owing to some loose advance  While vain coquets affect to be pursu'd  And think they're virtuous if not grossly lewd  Let this great maxim be my virtue's guide  In part she is to blame that has been try'd  He comes too near that comes to be deny'd  The GENTLEMAN's Answer  WHilst pretty fellows think a woman's fame  In ev'ry state and ev'ry age the same  With their own folly pleas'd the fair they toast  And where they least are happy swear they're most  No difference making 'twixt coquet and prude  And her that seems yet is not really lewd  While thus they think and thus they vainly live  And taste no joys but what their fancies give  Let this great maxim be my action's guide  May I ne'er hope tho' I am ne'er deny'd  Nor think a woman won that's willing to be try'd  An EPISTLE to Lord BT  By the Same  HOW happy you who varied joys pursue  And every hour presents you something new  Plans schemes and models all Palladio's art  For six long months have gain'd upon your heart  Of colonades of corridores you talk  The winding staircase and the cover'd walk  You blend the orders with Vitruvian toil  And raise with wond'rous joy the fancy'd pile  But the dull workman's slowperforming hand  But coldly executes his lord's command  With dirt and mortar soon you grow displeas'd  Planting succeeds and avenues are rais'd  Canals are cut and mountains level made  Bowers of retreat and galleries of shade  The shaven turf presents a lively green  The bordering flow'rs in mystick knots are seen  With studied art on nature you refine  The spring beheld you warm in this design  But scarce the cold attacks your fav'rite trees  Your inclination fails and wishes freeze  You quit the grove so lately you admir'd  With other views your eager hopes are fir'd  Post to the city you direct your way  Not blooming paradise could bribe your stay  Ambition shews you power's brightest side  'Tis meanly poor in solitude to hide  Tho certain pains attend the cares of state  A good man owes his country to be great  Should act abroad the high distinguish'd part  Or shew at least the purpose of the heart  With thoughts like these the shining courts you seek  Full of new projects for almost a week  You then despise the tinsel glittering snare  Think vile mankind below a serious care  Life is too short for any distant aim  And cold the dull reward of future fame  Be happy then while yet you have to live  And love is all the blessing heav'n can give  Fir'd by new passion you address the fair  Survey the opera as a gay paterre  Young Cloe's bloom had made you certain prize  But for a sidelong glance from Celia's eyes  Your beating heart acknowledges her pow'r  Your eager eyes her lovely form devour  You feel the poison swelling in your breast  And all your soul by fond desire possess'd  In dying sighs a long three hours are past  To some assembly with impatient haste  With trembling hope and doubtful fear you move  Resolv'd to tempt your fate and own your love  But there Belinda meets you on the stairs  Easy her shape attracting all her airs  A smile she gives and with a smile can wound  Her melting voice has musick in the sound  Her ev'ry motion wears resistless grace  Wit in her mein and pleasure in her face  Here while you vow eternity of love  Cloe and Celia unregarded move  Thus on the sands of Afric's burning plains  However deeply made no long impress remains  The lightest leaf can leave its figure there  The strongest form is scatter'd by the air  So yielding the warm temper of your mind  So touch'd by every eye so toss'd by wind  Oh how unlike the heav'n my soul design'd  Unseen unheard the throng around me move  Not wishing praise insensible of love  No whispers soften nor no beauties fire  Careless I see the dance and coldly hear the lyre  So num'rous herds are driven o'er the rock  No print is left of all the passing flock  So sings the wind around the solid stone  So vainly beat the waves with fruitless moan  Tedious the toil and great the workman's care  Who dare attempt to fix impressions there  But should some swain more skilful than the rest  Engrave his name upon this marble breast  Not rolling ages cou'd deface that name  Through all the storms of life 'tis still the same  Tho' length of years with moss may shade the ground  Deep tho' unseen remains the secret wound  EPILOGUE To  MARY  Queen of  SCOTS  Design'd to be spoken by Mrs  OLDFIELD  WHAT cou'd luxurious woman wish for more  To fix her joys or to extend her pow'r  Their ev'ry wish was in this Mary seen  Gay witty youthful beauteous and a queen  Vain useless blessings with ill conduct join'd  Light as the air and fleeting as the wind  Whatever poets write and lovers vow  Beauty what poor omnipotence hast thou  Queen Bess had wisdom council power and laws  How few espous'd a wretched beauty's cause  Learn hence ye fair more solid charms to prize  Contemn the idle flatt'rers of your eyes  The brightest object shines but while 'tis new  That influence lessens by familiar view  Monarchs and beauties rule with equal sway  All strive to serve and glory to obey  Alike unpitied when depos'd they grow  Men mock the idol of their former vow  Two great examples have been shown today  To what sure ruin passion does betray  What long repentance to short joys is due  When reason rules what glory does ensue  If you will love love like Eliza then  Love for amusement like those traytors men  Think that the pastime of a leisure hour  She favour'd oftbut never shar'd her pow'r  The traveller by desart wolves pursu'd  If by his art the savage foe's subdu'd  The world will still the noble act applaud  Tho' victory was gain'd by needful fraud  Such is my tender sex our helpless case  And such the barbarous heart hid by the begging face  By passion fir'd and not withheld by shame  They cruel hunters are we trembling game  Trust me dear ladies for I know 'em well  They burn to triumph and they sigh to tell  Cruel to them that yield cullies to them that sell  Believe me 'tis by far the wiser course  Superior art should meet superior force  Hear but be faithful to your int'rest still  Secure your heartsthen fool with whom you will  A RECEIPT to Cure the VAPOURS  Written to Lady JN  By the Same  I  WHY will Delia thus retire  And languish life away  While the sighing crowd admire  'Tis too soon for hartshorn tea  II  All those dismal looks and fretting  Cannot Damon's life restore  Long ago the worms have eat him  You can never see him more  III  Once again consult your toilet  In the glass your face review  So much weeping soon will spoil it  And no spring your charms renew  IV  I like you was born a woman  Well I know what vapours mean  The disease alas is common  Single we have all the Spleen  V  All the morals that they tell us  Never cur'd the sorrow yet  Chuse among the pretty fellows  One of humour youth and wit  VI  Prithee hear him every morning  At the least an hour or two  Once again at night returning  I believe the dose will do  THE SPLEEN AN EPISTLE TO MR C J  By Mr MATTHEW GREEN of the Customhouse  THIS motly piece to you I send  Who always were a faithful friend  Who if disputes should happen hence  Can best explain the author's sense  And anxious for the publick weal  Do what I fing so often feel  The want of method pray excuse  Allowing for a vapour'd muse  Nor to a narrow path confin'd  Hedge in by rules a roving mind  The child is genuine you can trace  Throughout the sire's transmitted face  Nothing is stol'n my muse tho' mean  Draws from the spring she finds within  Nor vainly buys what Gildon sells  Poetick buckets for dry wells  Schoolhelps I want to climb on high  Where all the antient treasures lie  And there unseen commit a theft  On wealth in Greek exchequers left  Then where from whom what can I steal  Who only with the moderns deal  This were attempting to put on  Rayment from naked bodies won  They safely sing before a thief  They cannot give who want relief  Some few excepted names well known  And justly laurel'd with renown  Whose stamp of genius marks their ware  And theft detects of theft beware  From Moore so lash'd example fit  Shun petty larceny in wit  First know my friend I do not mean  To write a treatise on the Spleen  Nor to prescribe when nerves convulse  Nor mend th' alarum watch your pulse  If I am right your question lay  What course I take to drive away  The daymare Spleen by whose false pleas  Men prove mere suicides in ease  And how I do myself demean  In stormy world to live serene  When by it's magick lantern Spleen  With frightful figures spread life's scene  And threat'ning prospects urg'd my fears  A stranger to the luck of heirs  Reason some quiet to restore  Shew'd part was substance shadow more  With Spleen's dead weight tho' heavy grown  In life's rough tide I sunk not down  But swam till fortune threw a rope  Buoyant on bladders fill'd with hope  I always choose the plainest food  To mend viscidity of blood  Hail watergruel healing power  Of easy access to the poor  Thy help love's confessors implore  And doctors secretly adore  To thee I fly by thee dilute  Thro' veins my blood doth quicker shoot  And by swift current throws off clean  Prolifick particles of Spleen  I never sick by drinking grow  Nor keep myself a cup too low  And seldom Cloe's lodgings haunt  Thrifty of spirits which I want  Hunting I reckon very good  To brace the nerves and stir the blood  But after no fieldhonours itch  Atchiev'd by leaping hedge and ditch  While Spleen lies soft relax'd in bed  Or o'er coalfires inclines the head  Hygeia's sons with hound and horn  And jovial cry awake the morn  These see her from her dusky plight  Smear'd by th' embraces of the night  With roral wash redeem her face  And prove herself of Titan's race  And mounting in loose robes the skies  Shed light and fragrance as she flies  Then horse and hound fierce joy display  Exulting at the Hark away  And in pursuit o'er tainted ground  From lungs robust fieldnotes resound  Then as St George the dragon slew  Spleen pierc'd trod down and dying view  While all the spirits are on wing  And woods and hills and vallies ring  To cure the mind's wrong biass Spleen  Some recommend the bowlinggreen  Some hilly walks all exercise  Fling but a stone the giant dies  Laugh and be well Monkeys have been  Extreme good doctors for the Spleen  And kitten if the humour hit  Has harlequin'd away the fit  Since mirth is good on this behalf  At some partic'lars let us laugh  Witlings brisk fools curs'd with half sense  That stimulates their impotence  Who buz in rhime and like blind flies  Err with their wings for want of eyes  Poor authors worshiping a calf  Deep tragedies that make us laugh  A strict dissenter saying grace  A lect'rer preaching for a place  Folks things prophetick to dispense  Making the past the future tense  The popish dubbing of a priest  Fine epitaphs on knaves deceas'd  Greenapron'd Pythonissa's rage  Great Aesculapius on his stage  A miser starving to be rich  The prior of Newgate's dying speech  A jointur'd widow's ritual state  Two Jews disputing tête à tête  New almanacks compos'd by seers  Experiments on felons ears  Disdainful prudes who ceaseless ply  The superb muscle of the eye  A coquet's Aprilweather face  A Queenb'rough mayor behind his mace  And fops in military shew  Are sov'reign for the case in view  If Spleenfogs rise at close of day  I clear my ev'ning with a play  Or to some concert take my way  The company the shine of lights  The scenes of humour musick's flights  Adjust and set the soul to rights  Life's moving pictures wellwrought plays  To other's griefs attention raise  Here while the tragick fictions glow  We borrow joy by pitying woe  There gaily comick scenes delight  And hold true mirrors to our sight  Virtue in charming dress array'd  Calling the passions to her aid  When moral scenes just action join  Takes shape and shews her face divine  Musick has charms we all may find  Ingratiate deeply with the mind  When art does sound's high pow'r advance  To musick's pipe the passions dance  Motions unwill'd it's pow'rs have shewn  Tarantulated by a tune  Many have held the soul to be  Nearly ally'd to harmony  Her have I known indulging grief  And shunning company's relief  Unveil her face and looking round  Own by neglecting sorrow's wound  The consanguinity of sound  In rainy days keep double guard  Or Spleen will surely be too hard  Which like those fish by sailors met  Fly highest while their wings are wet  In such dull weather so unfit  To enterprize a work of wit  When clouds one yard of azure sky  That's fit for simile deny  I dress my face with studious looks  And shorten tedious hours with books  But if dull fogs invade the head  That mem'ry minds not what is read  I sit in window dry as ark  And on the drowning world remark  Or to some coffeehouse I stray  For news the manna of a day  And from the hipp'd discourses gather  That politicks go by the weather  Then seek good humour'd tavern chums  And play at cards but for small sums  Or with the merry fellows quaff  And laugh aloud with them that laugh  Or drink a jocoserious cup  With souls who've took their freedom up  And let my mind beguil'd by talk  In Epicurus' garden walk  Who thought it heav'n to be serene  Pain hell and purgatory Spleen  Sometimes I dress with women sit  And chat away the gloomy fit  Quit the stiff garb of serious sense  And wear a gay impertinence  Nor think nor speak with any pains  But lay on fancy's neck the reins  Talk of unusual swell of waist  In maid of honour loosely lac'd  And beauty borr'wing Spanish red  And loving pair with sep'rate bed  And jewels pawn'd for loss of game  And then redeem'd by loss of fame  Of Kitty aunt left in the lurch  By grave pretence to go to church  Perceiv'd in hack with lover fine  Like Will and Mary on the coin  And thus in modish manner we  In aid of sugar sweeten tea  Permit ye fair your idol form  Which e'en the coldest heart can warm  May with its beauties grace my line  While I bow down before its shrine  And your throng'd altars with my lays  Perfume and get by giving praise  With speech so sweet so sweet a mien  You excommunicate the Spleen  Which fiendlike flies the magick ring  You form with sound when pleas'd to sing  Whate'er you say howe'er you move  We look we listen and approve  Your touch which gives to feeling bliss  Our nerves officious throng to kiss  By Celia's pat on their report  The graveair'd soul inclin'd to sport  Renounces wisdom's sullen pomp  And loves the floral game to romp  But who can view the pointed rays  That from black eyes scintillant blaze  Love on his throne of glory seems  Encompass'd with Satellite beams  But when blue eyes more softly bright  Diffuse benignly humid light  We gaze and see the smiling loves  And Cytherea's gentle doves  And raptur'd fix in such a face  Love's mercyseat and throne of grace  Shine but on age you melt its snow  Again fires longextinguish'd glow  And charm'd by witchery of eyes  Blood long congealed liquifies  True miracle and fairly done  By heads which are ador'd while on  But oh what pity 'tis to find  Such beauties both of form and mind  By modern breeding much debas'd  In half the female world at least  Hence I with care such lott'ries shun  Where a prize miss'd I'm quite undone  And han't by vent'ring on a wife  Yet run the greatest risk in life  Mothers and guardian aunts forbear  Your impious pains to form the fair  Nor lay out so much cost and art  But to deflow'r the virgin heart  Of ev'ry follyfost'ring bed  By quick'ning heat of custom bred  Rather than by your culture spoil'd  Desist and give us nature wild  Delighted with a hoyden soul  Which truth and innocence controul  Coquets leave off affected arts  Gay fowlers at a flock of hearts  Woodcocks to shun your snares have skill  You shew so plain you strive to kill  In love the artless catch the game  And they scarce miss who never aim  The world's great author did create  The sex to fit the nuptial state  And meant a blessing in a wife  To solace the fatigues of life  And old inspired times display  How wives could love and yet obey  Then truth and patience of controul  And housewifearts adorn'd the soul  And charms the gift of nature shone  And jealousy a thing unknown  Veils were the only masks they wore  Novels receipts to make a whore  Nor ombre nor quadrille they knew  Nor Pam's puissance felt at loo  Wise men did not to be thought gay  Then compliment their pow'r away  But lest by frail desires misled  The girls forbidden paths should tread  Of ign'rance rais'd the safe high wall  But we hawhaws that shew them all  Thus we at once solicit sense  And charge them not to break the fence  Now if untir'd consider friend  What I avoid to gain my end  I never am at Meeting seen  Meeting that region of the Spleen  The broken heart the busy fiend  The inward call on Spleen depend  Law licens'd breaking of the peace  To which vacation is disease  A gypsy diction scarce known well  By th' magi who lawfortunes tell  I shun nor let it breed within  Anxiety and that the Spleen  Law grown a forest where perplex  The mazes and the brambles vex  Where its twelve verd'rers every day  Are changing still the publick way  Yet if we miss our path and err  We grievous penalties incur  And wand'rers tire and tear their skin  And then get out where they went in  I never game and rarely bet  Am loth to lend or run in debt  No compterwrits me agitate  Who moralizing pass the gate  And there mine eyes on spendthrifts turn  Who vainly o'er their bondage mourn  Wisdom before beneath their care  Pays her upbraiding visits there  And forces folly thro' the grate  Her panegyrick to repeat  This view profusely when inclin'd  Enters a caveat in the mind  Experience join'd with common sense  To mortals is a providence  Passion as frequently is seen  Subsiding settles into Spleen  Hence as the plague of happy life  I run away from partystrife  A prince's cause a church's claim  I've known to raise a mighty flame  And priest as stoker very free  To throw in peace and charity  That tribe whose practicals decree  Smallbeer the deadliest heresy  Who fond of pedigree derive  From the most noted whore alive  Who own wine's old prophetick aid  And love the mitre Bacchus made  Forbid the faithful to depend  On halfpint drinkers for a friend  And in whose gay redletter'd face  We read goodliving more than grace  Nor they so pure and so precise  Immac'late as their white of eyes  Who for the spirit hug the Spleen  Phylacter'd throughout all their mien  Who their illtasted homebrew'd pray'r  To the state's mellow forms prefer  Who doctrines as infectious fear  Which are not sleep'd in vinegar  And samples of heartchested grace  Expose in shewglass of the face  Did never me as yet provoke  Either to honour band and cloak  Or deck my hat with leaves of oak  I rail not with mockpatriot grace  At folks because they are in place  Nor hir'd to praise with stallion pen  Serve the earlechery of men  And to avoid religious jars  The laws are my expositors  Which in my doubting mind create  Conformity to church and state  I go pursuant to my plan  To Mecca with the caravan  And think it right in common sense  Both for diversion and defence  Reforming schemes are none of mine  To mend the world's a vast design  Like theirs who tug in little boat  To pull to them the ship afloat  While to defeat their labour'd end  At once both wind and stream contend  Success herein is seldom seen  And zeal when baffled turns to Spleen  Happy the man who innocent  Grieves not at ills he can't prevent  His skiff does with the current glide  Not puffing pull'd against the tide  He paddling by the scuffling crowd  Sees unconcern'd life's wager row'd  And when he can't prevent foul play  Enjoys the folly of the fray  By these reflections I repeal  Each hasty promise made in zeal  When gl Ps say  We're bound our great light to display  And India darkness drive away  Yet none but drunken watchmen send  And scoundrel linkboys for that end  When they cry up this holy war  Which ev'ry christian should be for  Yet such as owe the law their ears  We find employ'd as engineers  This view my forward zeal so shocks  In vain they hold the moneybox  At such a conduct which intends  By vicious means such virtuous ends  I laugh off Spleen and keep my pence  From spoiling Indian innocence  Yet philosophick love of ease  I suffer not to prove disease  But rise up in the virtuous cause  Of a free press and equal laws  The press restrain'd nefandous thought  In vain our sires have nobly sought  While free from force the press remains  Virtue and freedom chear our plains  And learning largesses bestows  And keeps uncensur'd open house  We to the nation's publick mart  Our works of wit and schemes of art  And philosophick goods this way  Like watercarriage cheap convey  This tree which knowledge so affords  Inquisitors with flaming swords  From layapproach with zeal defend  Lest their own paradise should end  The press from her fecundous womb  Brought forth the arts of Greece and Rome  Her offspring skill'd in logick war  Truth's banner wav'd in open air  The monster Superstition fled  And hid in shade its Gorgon head  And lawless pow'r the longkept field  By reason quell'd was forc'd to yield  This nurse of arts and freedom's fence  To chain is treason against sense  And Liberty thy thousand tongues  None silence who design no wrongs  For those that use the gag's restraint  First rob before they stop complaint  Since disappointment galls within  And subjugates the soul to Spleen  Most schemes as moneysnares I hate  And bite not at projector's bait  Sufficient wrecks appear each day  And yet fresh fools are cast away  Ere well the bubbled can turn round  Their painted vessel runs aground  Or in deep seas it oversets  By a fierce hurricane of debts  Or helmdirectors in one trip  Freight first embezzled sink the ship  Such was of late a corporation  The brazen serpent of the nation  Which when hard accidents distress'd  The poor must look at to be blest  And thence expect with paper seal'd  By fraud and us'ry to be heal'd  I in no soulconsumption wait  Whole years at levees of the great  And hungry hopes regale the while  On the spare diet of a smile  There you may see the idol stand  With mirror in his wanton hand  Above below now here now there  He throws about the sunny glare  Crowds pant and press to seize the prize  The gay delusion of their eyes  When fancy tries her limning skill  To draw and colour at her will  And raise and round the figures well  And shew her talent to excel  I guard my heart lest it should woo  Unreal beauties fancy drew  And disappointed feel despair  At loss of things that never were  When I lean politicians mark  Grazing on aether in the park  Who e'er on wing with open throats  Fly at debates expresses votes  Just in the manner swallows use  Catching their airy food of news  Whose latrant stomachs oft molest  The deeplaid plans their dreams suggest  Or see some poet pensive sit  Fondly mistaking Spleen for Wit  Who tho' shortwinded still will aim  To sound the epick trump of Fame  Who still on Phoebus' smiles will doat  Nor learn conviction from his coat  I bless my stars I never knew  Whimseys which close pursu'd undo  And have from old experience been  Both parent and the child of Spleen  These subjects of Apollo's state  Who from false fire derive their fate  With airy purchases undone  Of lands which none lend money on  Born dull had follow'd thriving ways  Nor lost one hour to gather bays  Their fancies first delirious grew  And scenes ideal took for true  Fine to the sight Parnassus lies  And with false prospects cheats their eyes  The fabled goods the poets sing  A season of perpetual spring  Brooks flow'ry fields and groves of trees  Affording sweets and similes  Gay dreams inspir'd in myrtle bow'rs  And wreaths of undecaying flow'rs  Apollo's harp with airs divine  The sacred musick of the nine  Views of the temple rais'd to Fame  And for a vacant nitch proud aim  Ravish their souls and plainly shew  What fancy's sketching power can do  They will attempt the mountain steep  Where on the top like dreams in sleep  The Muses revelations shew  That find men crack'd or make them so  You friend like me the trade of rhime  Avoid elab'rate waste of time  Nor are content to be undone  And pass for Phoebus' crazy son  Poems the hopgrounds of the brain  Afford the most uncertain gain  And lott'ries never tempt the wise  With blanks so many to a prize  I only transient visits pay  Meeting the Muses in my way  Scarce known to the fastidious dames  Nor skill'd to call them by their names  Nor can their passports in these days  Your profit warrant or your praise  On poems by their dictates writ  Criticks as sworn appraisers sit  And mere upholst'rers in a trice  On gems and painting set a price  These tayl'ring artists for our lays  Invent cramp'd rules and with strait stays  Striving free nature's shape to hit  Emaciate sense before they fit  A common place and many friends  Can serve the plagiary's ends  Whose easy vamping talent lies  First wit to pilfer then disguise  Thus some devoid of art and skill  To search the mine on Pindus' hill  Proud to aspire and workmen grow  By genius doom'd to stay below  For their own digging shew the town  Wit's treasure brought by others down  Some wanting if they find a mine  An artist's judgment to refine  On fame precipitately fix'd  The ore with baser metals mix'd  Melt down impatient of delay  And call the vicious mass a play  All these engage to serve their ends  A band select of trusty friends  Who lesson'd right extol the thing  As Psapho taught his birds to sing  Then to the ladies they submit  Returning officers on wit  A crowded house their presence draws  And on the beaus imposes laws  And judgment in its favour ends  When all the pannel are its friends  Their natures merciful and mild  Have from mere pity sav'd the child  In bulrush ark the bantling found  Helpless and ready to be drown'd  They have preserv'd by kind support  And brought the babymuse to court  But there's a youth that you can name  Who needs no leadingstrings to fame  Whose quick maturity of brain  The birth of Pallas may explain  Dreaming of whose depending fate  I heard Melpomene debate  This this is he that was foretold  Should emulate our Greeks of old  Inspir'd by me with sacred art  He sings and rules the varied heart  If Jove's dread anger he rehearse  We hear the thunder in his verse  If he describe love turn'd to rage  The furies riot on his page  If he fair liberty and law  By ruffian pow'r expiring draw  The keener passions then engage  Aright and sanctify their rage  If he attempt disastrous love  We hear those plaints that wound the grove  Within the kinder passions glow  And tears distill'd from pity flow  From the bright vision I descend  And my deserted theme attend  Me never did ambition seize  Strange fever most inflam'd by ease  The active lunacy of pride  That courts jilt Fortune for a bride  This par'disetree so fair and high  I vew with no aspiring eye  Like aspine shake the restless leaves  And Sodomfruit our pains deceives  Whence frequent falls give no surprize  But fits of Spleen call'd growing wise  Greatness in glitt'ring forms display'd  Affects weak eyes much us'd to shade  And by its falslyenvy'd scene  Gives selfdebasing fits of spleen  We should be pleas'd that things are so  Who do for nothing see the show  And middlesiz'd can pass between  Life's hubbub safe because unseen  And 'midst the glare of greatness trace  A watry sunshine in the face  And pleasures fled too to redress  The sad fatigue of idleness  Contentment parent of delight  So much a stranger to our sight  Say goddess in what happy place  Mortals behold thy blooming face  Thy gracious auspices impart  And for thy temple chuse my heart  They whom thou deignest to inspire  Thy science learn to bound desire  By happy alchymy of mind  They turn to pleasure all they find  They both disdain in outward mien  The grave and solemn garb of spleen  And meretricious arts of dress  To feign a joy and hide distress  Unmov'd when the rude tempest blows  Without an opiate they repose  And cover'd by your shield defy  The whizzing shafts that round them fly  Nor meddling with the Gods' affairs  Concern themselves with distant cares  But place their bliss in mental rest  And feast upon the good possess'd  Forc'd by soft violence of pray'r  The blythsome goodess sooths my care  I feel the deity inspire  And thus she models my desire  Two hundred pounds halfyearly paid  Annuity securely made  A farm some twenty miles from town  Small tight salubrious and my own  Two maids that never saw the town  A servingman not quite a clown  A boy to help to tread the mow  And drive while t'other holds the plough  A chief of temper form'd to please  Fit to converse and keep the keys  And better to preserve the peace  Commission'd by the name of niece  With understandings of a size  To think their master very wise  May heav'n it's all I wish for send  One genial room to treat a friend  Where decent cupboard little plate  Display benevolence not state  And may my humble dwelling stand  Upon some chosen spot of land  A pond before full to the brim  Where cows may cool and geese may swim  Behind a green like velvet neat  Soft to the eye and to the feet  Where od'rous plants in evening fair  Breathe all around ambrosial air  From Eurus foe to kitchenground  Fenc'd by a slope with bushes crown'd  Fit dwelling for the feather'd throng  Who pay their quitrents with a song  With op'ning views of hill and dale  Which sense and fancy too regale  Where the halfcirque which vision bounds  Like amphitheatre surrounds  And woods impervious to the breeze  Thick phalanx of embodied trees  From hills thro' plains in dusk array  Extended far repel the day  Here stillness height and solemn shade  Invite and contemplation aid  Here nymphs from hollow oaks relate  The dark decrees and will of fate  And dreams beneath the spreading beach  Inspire and docile fancy teach  While soft as breezy breath of wind  Impulses rustle thro' the mind  Here Dryads scorning Phoebus' ray  While Pan melodious pipes away  In measur'd motions frisk about  'Till old Silenus puts them out  There see the clover pea and bean  Vie in variety of green  Fresh pastures speckled o'er with sheep  Brown fields their fallow sabbaths keep  Plump Ceres golden tresses wear  And poppytopknots deck her hair  And silver streams through meadows stray  And Naiads on the margin play  And lesser nymphs on side of hills  From plaything urns pour down the rills  Thus shelter'd free from care and strife  May I enjoy a calm thro' life  See faction safe in low degree  As men at land see storms at sea  And laugh at miserable elves  Not kind so much as to themselves  Curs'd with such souls of base alloy  As can possess but not enjoy  Debarr'd the pleasure to impart  By av'rice sphincter of the heart  Who wealth hard earn'd by guilty cares  Bequeath untouch'd to thankless heirs  May I with look ungloom'd by guile  And wearing virtue's liv'rysmile  Prone the distressed to relieve  And little trespasses forgive  With income not in fortune's pow'r  And skill to make a busy hour  Which trips to town life to amuse  To purchase books and hear the news  To see old friends brush off the clown  And quicken taste at coming down  Unhurt by sickness' blasting rage  And slowly mellowing in age  When fate extends its gath'ring gripe  Fall off like fruit grown fully ripe  Quit a worn being without pain  Perhaps to blossom soon again  But now more serious see me grow  And what I think my Memmius know  Th' enthusiast's hopes and raptures wild  Have never yet my reason foil'd  His springy soul dilates like air  When free from weight of ambient care  And hush'd in meditations deep  Slides into dreams as when asleep  Then fond of new discov'ries grown  Proves a Columbus of her own  Disdains the narrow bounds of place  And thro' the wilds of endless space  Born up on metaphysick wings  Chases light forms and shadowy things  And in the vague excursion caught  Brings home some rare exotick thought  The melancholy man such dreams  As brightest evidence esteems  Fain would he see some distant scene  Suggested by his restless spleen  And fancy's telescope applies  With tinctur'd glass to cheat his eyes  Such thoughts as love the gloom of night  I close examine by the light  For who tho' brib'd by gain to lie  Dare sunbeam written truths deny  And execute plain common sense  On faith's meer hearsay evidence  That superstition mayn't create  And club its ills with those of fate  I many a notion take to task  Made dreadful by its visormask  Thus scruple spasm of the mind  Is cur'd and certainty I find  Since optick reason shews me plain  I dreaded spectres of the brain  And legendary fears are gone  Tho' in tenacious childhood sown  Thus in opinions I commence  Freeholder in the proper sense  And neither suit nor service do  Nor homage to pretenders shew  Who boast themselves by spurious roll  Lords of the mannor of the soul  Preferring sense from chin that's bare  To nonsense thron'd in whisker'd hair  To thee Creator uncreate  O Entium Ens divinely great  Hold muse nor melting pinions try  Nor near the blazing glory fly  Nor straining break thy feeble bow  Unfeather'd arrows far to throw  Thro' fields unknown nor madly stray  Where no ideas mark the way  With tender eyes and colours faint  And trembling hands forbear to paint  Who features veil'd by light can hit  Where can what has no outline sit  My soul the vain attempt forego  Thyself the fitter subject know  He wisely shuns the bold extreme  Who soon lays by th' unequal theme  Nor runs with wisdom's Sirens caught  On quicksands swall'wing shipwreck'd thought  But conscious of his distance gives  Mute praise and humble negatives  In one no object of our sight  Immutable and infinite  Who can't be cruel or unjust  Calm and resign'd I fix my trust  To him my past and present state  I owe and must my future fate  A stranger into life I'm come  Dying may be our going home  Transported here by angry fate  The convicts of a prior state  Hence I no anxious thoughts bestow  On matters I can never know  Thro' life's foul ways like vagrant pass'd  He'll grant a settlement at last  And with sweet ease the wearied crown  By leave to lay his being down  If doom'd to dance th' eternal round  Of life no sooner lost but found  And dissolution soon to come  Like spunge wipes out life's present sum  But can't our state of pow'r bereave  An endless series to receive  Then if hard dealt with here by fate  We ballance in another state  And consciousness must go along  And sign th' acquittance for the wrong  He for his creatures must decree  More happiness than misery  Or be supposed to create  Curious to try what 'tis to hate  And do an act which rage infers  'Cause lameness halts or blindness errs  Thus thus I steer my bark and sail  On even keel with gentle gale  At helm I make my reason sit  My crew of passions all submit  If dark and blustring prove some nights  Philosophy puts forth her lights  Experience holds the cautions glass  To shun the breakers as I pass  And frequent throws the wary lead  To see what dangers may be hid  And once in seven years I'm seen  At Bath or Tunbridge to careen  Tho' pleas'd to see the dolphins play  I mind my compass and my way  With store sufficient for relief  And wisely still prepar'd to reef  Nor wanting the dispersive bowl  Of cloudy weather in the soul  I make may heav'n propitious send  Such wind and weather to the end  Neither becalm'd nor overblown  Life's voyage to the world unknown  An EPIGRAM On the Reverend Mr  Laurence Eachard  's and Bishop  Gilbert Burnet  's Histories  By the Same  GIL's history appears to me  Political anatomy  A case of skeletons well done  And malefactors every one  His sharp and strong incision pen  Historically cuts up men  And does with lucid skill impart  Their inward ails of head and heart  LAURENCE proceeds another way  And welldress'd figures does display  His characters are all in flesh  Their hands are fair their faces fresh  And from his sweetning art derive  A better scent than when alive  He waxwork made to please the sons  Whose fathers were GIL's skeletons  The SPARROW and DIAMOND A SONG  By the Same  I  I Lately saw what now I sing  Fair Lucia's hand display'd  This finger grac'd a diamond ring  On that a sparrow play'd  II  The feather'd plaything she caress'd  She stroak'd its head and wings  And while it nestled on her breast  She lisp'd the dearest things  III  With chizzel bill a spark ill set  He loosen'd from the rest  And swallow'd down to grind his meat  The easier to digest  IV  She seiz'd his bill with wild affright  Her diamond to discry  'Twas gone she sicken'd at the sight  Moaning her bird would die  V  The tonguety'd knocker none might use  The curtains none undraw  The footmen went without their shoes  The street was laid with straw  VI  The doctor us'd his oily art  Of strong emetick kind  Th' apothecary play'd his part  And engineer'd behind  VII  When physick ceas'd to spend its store  To bring away the stone  Dicky like people given o'er  Picks up when let alone  VIII  His eyes dispell'd their sickly dews  He peck'd behind his wing  Lucia recov'ring at the news  Relapses for the ring  IX  Meanwhile within her beauteous breast  Two different passions strove  When av'rice ended the contest  And triumph'd over love  X  Poor little pretty fluttering thing  Thy pains the sex display  Who only to repair a ring  Could take thy life away  XI  Drive av'rice from your breasts ye fair  Monster of foulest mien  Ye would not let it harbour there  Could but its form be seen  XII  It made a virgin put on guile  Truth's image break her word  A Lucia's face forbear to smile  A Venus kill her bird  JOVE and SEMELE  By the Same  Occasioned by a Lady's saying that none of the ancient poctical Stories reflect so much on the Vanity of Women as that of  Phaëton  does on the Ambition of Men  JOVE for amusement quitted oft his skies  To visit earth contracted to our size  And lov'd however things in heav'n might go  Exceedingly a game at romps below  Miss Semele he pick'd up as he went  And thought he pleas'd her to her heart's content  But minds aspiring ne'er can be at ease  Once known a god as man he ceas'd to please  In tenderest time which women know 'tis said  Thus she bespoke the loving god in bed  Thou who gav'st Daedalus his mazy art  And knowest all things but a woman's heart  Hear my request for something yet untry'd  And swear by Styx I shall not be deny'd  Fond Jove like men the better to succeed  Took any oath then bid the girl proceed  In human guise great Jove leave off to rove  Deceiving womankind and pilf'ring love  What are those joys which as a man you give  To what a god of thunder can atchieve  Such measure of love and might of limbs employ  As give immortal madams heav'nly joy  Jove came array'd as bound by cruel fate  And Semele enjoy'd the god in state  When flaming splendors round his beamy head  Divinely shone and struck the mortal dead  Faint from the course though we a while retreat  To cool and breathe before another heat  The gods can't know fresh with eternal prime  Love's stinted pause nor want recruits from time  But must with unabating ardours kiss  And bear down nature with excess of bliss  Learn hence each fair one whom like beauties grace  Possess'd of lawless empire by your face  Not to do what you list because you may  Let cool discretion warm desires allay  And itching curiosity believe  A lurking taint deriv'd from mother Eve  Spare then the men ye fair and frankly own  Your sex like ours has had its Phaëton  The SEEKER  By the Same  WHEN I first came to London I rambled about  From sermon to sermon took a slice and went out  Then on me in divinity batchelor try'd  Many priests to obtrude a Levitical bride  And urging their various opinions intended  To make me wed systems which they recommended  Said a letch'rous old fry'r skulking near Lincoln'sInn  Whose trade's to absolve but whose pastime's to sin  Who spider like seizes weak protestant flies  Which hung in his sophistry cobweb he spies  Ah pity your soul for without our church pale  If you happen to die to be damn'd you can't fail  The bible you boast is a wild revelation  Hear a church that can't err if you hope for salvation  Said a formal noncon whose rich stock of grace  Lies forward expos'd in shopwindow of face  Ah pity your soul come be of our sect  For then you are safe and may plead you're elect  As it stands in the Acts we can prove ourselves saints  Being Christ's little flock ev'ry where spoke against  Said a jolly church parson devoted to ease  While penal law dragons guard his golden fleece  If you pity your soul I pray listen to neither  The first is in error the last a deceiver  That ours is the true church the sense of our tribe is  And surely  in medio tutissimus ibis  Said a yea and nay friend with a stiff hat and band  Who while he talk'd gravely would hold forth his hand  Dominion and wealth are the aim of all three  Tho' about ways and means  ey may all disagree  Then prithee be wise go the quakers byway  'Tis plain without turnpikes so nothing to pay  On BARCLAY's Apology for the Quakers  By the Same  THESE sheets primaeval doctrines yield  Where revelation is reveal'd  Soulphlegm from literal feeding bred  Systems lethargick to the head  They purge and yield a diet thin  That turns to gospelchyle within  Truth sublimate may here be seen  Extracted from the parts terrene  In these is shewn how men obtain  What of Prometheus poets feign  To scripture plainness dress is brought  And speech apparel to the thought  They hiss from instinct at red coats  And war whose work is cutting throats  Forbid and press the law of love  Breathing the spirit of the dove  Lucrative doctrines they detest  As manufactur'd by the priest  And throw down turnpikes where we pay  For stuff which never mends

 Throw golden apples in his way  Place me O heav'n in some retreat  There let the serious deathwatch beat  There let me self in silence shun  To feel thy will which should be done  Then comes the spirit to our hut  When fast the senses doors are shut  For so divine and pure a guest  The emptiest rooms are furnish'd best  O contemplation air serene  From damps of sense and fogs of spleen  Pure mount of thought thrice holy ground  Where grace when waited for is found  Here 'tis the soul feels sudden youth  And meets exulting virgin truth  Here like a breeze of gentlest kind  Impulses rustle thro' the mind  Here shines that light with glowing face  The fuse divine that kindles grace  Which if we trim our lamps will last  Till darkness be by dying past  And then goes out at end of night  Extinguish'd by superior light  Ah me the heats and colds of life  Pleasure's and pain's eternal strife  Breed stormy passions which confin'd  Shake like th' Aeolian cave the mind  And raise despair

crows that brought him bread and meat  PREEXISTENCE  A POEM In Imitation of  MILTON  Has quoniam coeli nondum dignamur honore  Quas dedimus certè terras habitare sinamus  NOW had th' archangel trumpet rais'd sublime  Above the walls of heav'n begun to sound  All aether took the blast and hell beneath  Shook with celestial noise th' almighty host  Hot with pursuit and reeking with the blood  Of guilty cherubs smear'd in sulphurous dust  Pause at the known command of sounding gold  And first they close the wide Tartarian gates  Th' impenetrable folds on brazen hinge  Roll creaking horrible the din beneath  O'ercomes the roar of flames and deafens hell  Then through the solid gloom with nimble wing  They cut their shining traces up to light  Return'd upon the edge of heavenly day  Where thinnest beams play round the vast obscure  And with eternal gleam drive back the night  They find the troops less stubborn less involv'd  In crime and ruin barr'd the realms of peace  Yet uncondemn'd to baleful seats of woe  Doubtful and suppliant all the plumes of light  Moult from their shuddering wings and sickly fear  Shades every face with horror conscious guilt  Rolls in the livid eyeball and each breast  Shakes with the dread of future doom unknown  'Tis here the wide circumference of heaven  Opens in two vast gates that inward turn  Voluminous on jasper columns hung  By geometry divine they ever glow  With living sculptures that arise by turns  T'imboss the shining leaves by turns they set  To give succeeding argument their place  In holy hieroglyphicks on they move  The gaze of journeying angels as they pass  Oft looking back and held in deep surprize  Here stood the troops distinct the cherub guard  Unbarr'd the splendid gates and in they roll  Harmonious for a vocal spirit sits  Within each hinge and as they onward drive  In just divisions breaks the num'rous jarr  With symphony melodious such as spheres  Involv'd in tenfold wreaths are said to sound  Out flows a blaze of glory for on high  Tow'ring advanc'd the moving throne of God  Vast and majestick on each radiant side  The pointed rays slope glittering at the foot  Glides a full tide of day that onward pours  In liquid torrents through the black abyss  Sparkling among reluctant shades which thence  Retire confus'd as when Vesuvio shakes  With inward torments and disgorges flames  O'er the vast mountain's ridge the burning waves  Drive their refulgent curls and on they roll  Sweeping the glowing plains down to the sea  Th' affrighted sea leaps back with hideous roar  To give the fire its course thus Chaos wild  Hissing recoils to let in floods of light  Above the throne th' ideas heavenly bright  Of past of present and of coming time  Fix'd their immov'd abode and there present  An endless landscape of created things  To sight celestial where angelick eyes  Are lost in prospect for the shiny range  Boundless and various in its bosom bears  Millions of fullproportion'd worlds beheld  With stedfast eyes till more arise to view  And farther inward scenes start up unknown  Myriads of seraphs in long series wait  About the throne and as it moves proceed  In numerous order to celestial song  Above the symphony of mellow flutes  And harps by flying angels gently touch'd  Relieve the trumpet's rage and fitly blend  The solemn sounds in harmony divine  Such as might tune new worlds and give the laws  To globes on high and the just figure guide  Of planets forming all their airy dance  Below the blazing wheels drive bounding o'er  The starry pavement stars and hills of light  Double their glories where the chariot rolls  With rattling sound and th' empyraeum vast  Down to its stedfast axis groans throughout  Under the burning tracts till now it rests  Upon the gaping brink of heaven and there  With open pomp fills the vast empty space  Silence ensues a deep and awful pause  More terrible all expectation held  In horror now wrath imminent amaz'd  With dreadful precipice to all it seems  More formidable near then from the throne  A vocal thunder roll'd the sense of God  Majestically long repugnant all  To princes customs here their judgments flash  On guilt wi  h words concise and sudden blaze  Quite otherwise the Gods' enlarged speech  Set wide the fate of things that all around  Might take full prospects of their coming doom  Servants of God and Virtues great in arms  W' approve your faithful works and you return  Bless'd from the dire pursuit of rebel foes  Resolv'd obdurate they have try'd the force  Of this right hand and known Almighty pow'r  Transfix'd with light'ning down they sunk they fell  Into the fiery gulph and deep they plunge  Below the burning waves to hide their heads  In shelter from my vengeance bellowing hence  More fierce and scorching with more dreadful fires  There let 'em find their doom that durst defy  Omnipotence and slight his proffer'd grace  Rolling in flames and ne'er to feel a dawn  Of heavenly day instead the mind imbibes  Eternal gloom and sindg'd with constant flames  Can find no ease while fierce their boiling rage  Eats through th'impyreal mould and glows within  With endless pain not one repentant thought  Shall cool the breast but proud in horrid crime  The soul anheals and hardens in the fire  But you commission'd by commands divine  Have wisely fill'd your trust and clos'd 'em all  Within the fervid lake lest any roam  Into the dark abyss to shun their doom  And in the womb immense of things unborn  Should seek annihilation you must rise  Among the shining virtues more sublime  On lofty thrones preferr'd for lofty deeds  For you ye guilty throng that lately join'd  In this sedition since seduc'd from good  And caught in trains of guile by spirits malign  Superior in their order you accept  Trembling my heavenly clemency and grace  When the long aera once has fill'd its orb  You shall emerge to light and humbly here  Again shall bow before this favouring throne  If your own virtue second my decree  But all must have their manes first below  So stands th' eternal fate but smoother yours  Than what lost angels feel nor can our reign  Without just dooms the peace of heav'n secure  For forms celestial new erect in glory  Wou'd totter dazzled with the heights of power  Did not the nerves of justice fix their sight  See where below in Chaos wond'rous deep  A speck of light dawns forth and thence throughout  The shades in many a wreath my forming power  There swiftly turns the burning eddy round  Absorbing all crude matter near its brink  Which next with subtile motions takes the form  I please to stamp the seed of infant worlds  All now in embryo but ere long shall rise  Variously scatter'd in this vast expanse  Involv'd in winding orbs until the brims  Of outward circles brush these heavenly gates  The middle point a globe of curling fire  Shall hold which round it sheds its genial heat  Wheree'er I kindle life the motion grows  In all the endless orbs from this machine  And infinite vicissitudes shall roll  About this restless center for I rear  In those meanders turn'd a dusty ball  Deform'd all o'er with woods whose shaggy tops  Inclose eternal mists and deadly damps  Hover within their boughs to choak the light  Impervious scenes of horror 'till reform'd  To fields and grassy dales and flow'ry meads  By your continual pains the torrid zone  Here fries with constant heat the swarthy world  Parching the plains where hideous monsters glare  And dusty mountains tumbled by the winds  Stretch their uncertain heaps no less the frost  At either end shall rage and high shall raise  Firm promontories vast the ruins seem  Of desart nature and th'eternal piles  Load all the dreary coast and thick in ice  Arm either pole that yearly peeps ascance  On coming light but feels no gentle ray  Unbind the frozen chain Between these lie  The changeful climes alternately they burn  And chill again by turns for both extremes  Make their incursions here and this my will  Unchangeable ordains your doleful seat  Beneath mishapen Chaos and the field  Of fighting atoms where hot moist and dry  Wage an eternal war with dismal roar  The dismal roar breaks smoothly on the ground  Sacred to horror and eternal night  Here Silence sits whose visionary shape  In folds of wreathy mantling sinks obscure  And in dark fumes reclines his drowsy head  An urn he holds from whence a lake proceeds  Wide flowing gently smooth and Lethe nam'd  Hither compell'd each soul must drink long draughts  Of those forgetful streams 'till forms within  And all the great ideas fade and die  For if vast thought shou'd play about a mind  Inclos'd in flesh and dragging cumbrous life  Fluttering and beating in the mournful cage  It soon wou'd break its grates and wing away  'Tis therefore my decree the soul return  Naked from off this beach and perfect blank  To visit the new world and strait to feel  Itself in crude consistence closely shut  The dreadful monument of just revenge  Immur'd by heaven's own hand and plac'd erect  On fleeting matter all imprison'd round  With walls of clay th' aethereal mould shall bear  The chain of members deafen'd with an ear  Blinded by eyes and manacled in hands  Here anger vast ambition and disdain  And all the haughty movements rise and fall  As storms of neighbouring atoms tear the soul  And hope and love and all the calmer turns  Of easy hours in their gay gilded shapes  With sudden run skim o'er deluded minds  As matter leads the dance but one desire  Unsatisfy'd shall mar ten thousand joys  The rank of beings that shall first advance  Drink deep of human life and long shall stay  On this great scene of cares From all the rest  That longer for the destin'd body wait  Less penance I expect and short abode  In those pale dreary kingdoms will content  Each has his lamentable lot and all  On different racks abide the pains of life  The pensive spirit takes the lonely grove  Nightly he visits all the sylvan scenes  Where far remote a melancholy moon  Raising her head serene and shorn of beams  Throws here and there her glimmerings thro' the trees  To make more awful darkness Starry lights  Hung up on high shed round 'em as they burn  A pale sad influence and they gild the plains  With doubtful rays which strike within the shades  A trembling lustre and uncertain light  The SAGE shall haunt this solitary ground  And view the dismal landscape limn'd within  In horrid shades mix'd with imperfect light  Here JUDGMENT blinded by delusive SENSE  Contracted through the cranny of an eye  Shoots up faint languid beams to that dark seat  Wherein the soul bereav'd of native fire  Sits intricate in misty clouds obscur'd  Ev'n from itself conceal'd and there presides  O'er jarring images with reason's sway  Which by his ordering more confounds their form  And by decisions more imbroils the fray  The more he strives t'appease the more he feels  The struggling surges of the darksome void  Impetuous and the thick revolving thoughts  Encount'ring thoughts image on image turn'd  A Chaos of wild science where sometimes  The clashing notions strike out casual light  Which soon must perish and be lost again  In the thick darkness round it Now he tries  With all his might to raise some weighty thought  Of Me of fate or of th' eternal round  Which but recoils to crush the labouring mind  High are his reasonings but the feeble clue  Of fleeting images he draws in vain  To wond'rous length for still the turning maze  Eludes his art its end flies far away  And leaves him tracing round the toilsome path  Returning oft on the same beaten thought  For much of good he talks and life serene  Of happiness deny'd the dismal waste  Of wisdom's privilege and th' obdurate breast  Stubborn in anguish idle wisdom all  Weak sorcery to charm a real pain  Distasting crowds and business thus he seeks  Diversion in himself but with deep thoughts  He kindles doubt and while he strives to blow  The ashes off revives the brand of care  Hence far remov'd a different noisy race  In cities full and frequent take their seat  Where honour's crush'd and gratitude oppress'd  With swelling hopes of gain that raise within  A tempest and drove onward by success  Can find no bounds For creatures of a day  Stretch their wide cares to ages full increase  Starves the penurious soul while empty sound  Fills the ambitious  that  shall ever shrink  Pining with endless cares whilst  this  shall swell  To tympany enormous Bright in arms  Here shines the hero out he fiercely leads  A martial throng his instruments of rage  To fill the world with death and thin mankind  Ambition drives and round the world he roams  Marking his way with blood the dreadful noise  Begets a fame and all the breath he leaves  Is spent in his false praise and vainly bloats  The tyrant's soul while high his kingdoms rise  In fleeting pomp hovering their gaudy wings  Around the servile globe that tamely bends  Beneath his haughty reign and all his slaves  Under his yoke shall groan and scarce shall groan  Without a crime here torturing engines roar  With human voice disguis'd earth water fire  Are made dire elements of cruelty  Subservient to his lust and power to kill  Yet shall the herd endure and dare not break  United their imaginary chain  While their great monarch chills with equal fears  No less a slave than they Each rumour shakes  The haughty purple dark and cloudy cares  Involve the awful throne that stands erect  Balanc'd on the wild people's temper'd rage  And fortify'd with the dangerous arts of power  But death shall shift those scenes of misery  Then doubtful titles kindle up new wars  And urge on ling'ring fate the ensigns blaze  About the camp and drums and trumpets sound  Prepare a solemn way to griezly war  Javelins and bearded spheres in ghastly ranks  Erect their shining heads and round the field  A harvest's seen of formidable death  Then joins the horrid shock whose bellowing burst  Torments the shatter'd air and drowns the groans  Of men below that roll in certain death  These are the mortal sports and tragick plays  By man himself embroil'd the dire debate  Makes the waste desart seem serene and mild  Where savage nature in one common lies  By homely cots possess'd all squalid wild  And despicably poor they range the field  And feel their share of hunger care and pain  Cheated by flying prey and now they tear  Their panting flesh and now with nails unclean  They tug their shaggy beards and deeply quaff  Of human woe even when they rudely sip  The flowing stream or chew the savoury pulp  Of nature's freshest viands fragrant fruits  Enjoy'd with trembling and in danger sought  But where th' appointed limits of a law  Fences the general safety of the world  No greater quiet reigns for wanton man  In giddy frolick easily leaps o'er  His own invented bounds hence rapine fraud  Revenge and lust and all the hideous train  Of nameless ills distort the meagre mind  To endless shapes of woe Here misers mourn  Departed gold and their defrauded heirs  Dire perjuries complain the blended loads  Of punishment and crime desorm the world  And give no rest to man with pangs and throws  He enters on the stage prophetick tears  And infant cries prelude his future woes  And all is one continu'd scene of grief  'Till the sad sable curtain falls in death  But that last act shall in one moment close  Of doubt and darkness pain shall crack the strings  Of life decay'd no less the soul convuls'd  Trembles in anxious cares and shuddering stands  Afraid to leap into the opening gulph  Of future fate till all the banks of clay  Fall from beneath his feet in vain he grasps  The shatter'd reeds that cheat his easy wish  Reason is now no more that narrow lamp  Which with its sickly fires wou'd shoot its beams  To distances unknown and stretch its rays  Ascance my paths in deepest darkness veil'd  Is sunk into his socket inly there  It burns a dismal light th' expiring flame  Is choak'd in fumes and parts in various doubt  Then the gay glories of the living world  Shall cast their empty varnish and retire  Out of his feeble view and rising shade  Sit hovering o'er all nature's various face  Musick shall cease and instruments of joy  Shall fail that sudden hour nor can the mind  Attend their sounds when fancies swim in death  Confus'd and crush'd with cares for long shall seem  The drearyroad and melancholy dark  That leads he knows not where here empty space  Gapes horrible and threatens to absorp  All being yonder sooty demons glare  And dolorous spectres grin the shapeless rout  Of wild imagination dance and play  Before his eyes obscure till all in death  Shall vanish and the prisoner now enlarg'd  Regains the flaming borders of the sky  He ended Peals of thunder rend the heavens  And Chaos from the bottom turn'd resounds  The mighty clangor All the heavenly host  Approve the high decree and loud they sing  Eternal justice while the guilty troops  Sad with their doom but sad without despair  Fall fluttering down to LETHE's lake and there  For penance and the destin'd body wait  CHIRON to ACHILLES A POEM  By HILBERNARD JACOB  Esq  Res est severa voluptas  OLD CHIRON to his pupil thus began  When he beheld him rip'ning into man  "Accomplish'd youth well worthy of my pains  "You now are free and guide yourself the reins  "Yet hear Achilles hear before we part  "A few short precepts from a faithful heart  "What tho' the gods a Nestor's age deny  "Let management a longer life supply  "And learn at least to live before you die  "A little tract well till'd more profit yields  "Than realms of wild uncultivated fields  "'Tis not from length of years our pleasures flow  "Nor to the gods alone our bliss we owe  "Our happiness and pain depend on us  "Man's his own good or evil genius  "Great ills by art we lighten or remove  "And art our meanest pleasures may improve  "Much to our selves is due tho' much to Jove  "Think not young prince your elevated state  "Birth honours or the empty name of great  "Can fix your joys they're ill secur'd unless  "You know your self to form you happiness  "Which in the shepherd's humble hut is found  "While palaces with discord still resound  "Fortune to industry is ever kind  "And tho' by the blind vulgar painted blind  "Is still more equal than the croud suppose  "Who judge of happiness by outward shows  "She smiles on all conditions each may be  "A man of pleasure in his own degree  "Yet few with art their happiness pursue  "Tho' all mankind have happiness in view  "And ev'ry sense seems made by nature's skill  "For giving pleasure and avoiding ill  "Nature our common mother has been kind  "And for a race of joy her sons design'd  "Who long to reach the goal yet lazy lag behind  "Or wholly blind or doubtful how t'advance  "They leave the work of industry to chance  "And of those few who with more active strife  "Pursue this great important end of life  "Some too impatient know not how to wait  "Or aim at things beyond their human state  "These last thro' too much delicacy fall  "And by refining rob themselves of all  "Shun then Achilles shun the faults of such  "Who still propose too little or too much  "Stretch not your hopes too far nor yet despair  "But above all of indolence beware  "Attend to what you do or life will seem  "But a meer vision or fantastick dream  "Pass'd in ideas of delight at best  "While real pleasure's lost in doubtful rest  "In short learn when and how to bear in vain  "He pleasure seeks who is afraid of pain  "Pleasure's a serious thing and cheaply bought  "By labour patience management and thought  "But you aspiring youth by nature seem  "Addicted to an opposite extreme  "Impetuous and restless soon inflam'd  "And like a gen'rous courser hardly tam'd  "In all things violent but O disdain  "Brave prince to let usurping passion reign  "In one rash moment sacrificing more  "Than years of sad repentance may restore  "As Thracian winds the Euxine sea molest  "So wrath and envy from an human breast  "Drive Halcyon peace and banish kindly rest  "And no security for joy is found  "But in a mind that's tractable and sound  "Suppress the first emotions of your ire  "And smother in its birth the kindling fire  "Ere anger yet possesses all your soul  "Ere yet your bosom heaves and eyeballs roll  "Think on the useful precepts I have taught  "And meet the rising heat with wholsome thought  "Or seek the sacred muses with your lyre  "Who with sweet peace to lonely shades retire  "Gods and the sons of gods the heroes sing  "While hills and valleys with their praises ring  "These learn to imitate and those adore  "And sweetly to yourself yourself restore  "Musick and verse and solitude controul  "Impetuous fury and compose the soul  "For this I early taught you how to sing  "And form'd your fingers to the trembling string  "For 'tis not all sweet pleasure's path to show  "The arts of consolation man should know  "Our joys are short and broken and in vain  "To constant bliss would human race attain  "Be oft contented to be free from pain  "There is a deity ordain'd by fate  "To damp our joys immoderately great  "That none on earth from sorrow shou'd be free  "But ev'n our blessings taste of misery  "If fortune gives what rarely we obtain  "An equal share of pleasure and of pain  "Our portion is o'erpaid the rest you'll find  "But fond ideas of the wanton mind  "Which now vain scenes of godlike pleasure shows  "And now creates imaginary woes  "When sad your ills examine and compare  "Judge of your own by what another's are  "Consider greater wretches and the fates  "Of mighty heroes and of mighty states  "Thus real evils in their proper light  "Appear the false thus vanish'd out of sight  "Nor aim at pleasures difficult to gain  "Choose rather such you may with ease obtain  "Who scorns to trifle is by pride abus'd  "I pity him who ne'er can be amus'd  "But slighting pleasures moderate and small  "Must live in rapture or not live at all  "Great pleasures still are near ally'd to pain  "Who quits the peaceful shore and ploughs the main  "Big waves and mighty tempests must sustain  "Let not such fond ambition to be blest  "The humbler pleasures in your power molest  "Yet cherish hope for without hope there's none  "Taste hope but be not fed with that alone  "Some their whole lives in expection spend  "As life were not begun or ne'er wou'd end  "Fondly from day to day themselves deceive  "Not living but intending still to live  "While they neglect the joys they might possess  "For empty dreams of future happiness  "Let nature in your pleasures be your guide  "Nor suffer art her genuine charms to hide  "Her beauties with unwearied eyes we see  "The truth of beauty is simplicity  "Live not by imitation servile state  "Nor on the fashion for your pleasures wait  "Man otherwise so selfish and so proud  "Submits his taste to the fantastick croud  "And lives not for himself do you pursue  "Your own desires and to yourself be true  "As bees extract their sweets from ev'ry flow'r  "So you your joys from all things in your pow'r  "With industry and management produce  "The meanest trifles are sometimes of use  "Yet know well what you do and when 'tis done  "Nor at all hours to ev'ry pleasure run  "But mix with art your pleasures and your toils  "For pleasures have their seasons and their foils  "Thus when the earliest dawn of eastern light  "Proclaims the finish'd empire of the night  "Haste to the field Achilles nor disdain  "To chace the foaming monster o'er the plain  "Or teach the untam'd steed to feel the rein  "Or let your car and arms your nerves prepare  "Or for Olympick games or future war  "Then whether arts or glory fire your mind  "With thoughts more generous or more refin'd  "Aurora to the Muses still is kind  "At noon a simple short repast be made  "A shorter slumber in the cooling shade  "What's gay and light th' unbended mind employs  "Or sports or past delights or future joys  "But when the eveningstar begins to rise  "When Phoebus' fainting steeds forsake the skies  "Still chearful at the wellspread board be found  "Amidst bright friends and with fresh garlands crown'd  "While wine and Thais with her voice and lyre  "Banish old sorrows and new joys inspire  "Thus when from toils of empire you are free  "Nor camp nor council claim your liberty  "The morn to labour and the Muses give  "At noon with temperance and quiet live  "Ceres' and Bacchus' gifts at ev'ning prove  "Divide the night with Somnus and with love  "Thus thus Pelides drive your cares away  "Nor feel the evil till the evil day  "What tho' on Simois or Scamander's shore  "Far off from home the Greeks your death deplore  "No matter where or when it once must be  "And nothing can revoke the firm decree  "Tho' Thetis' son tho' third from mighty Jove  "Eternal monarch of the realms above  "Nor Jove nor Thetis can your days recal  "Or for an hour deser your destin'd fall  "Mean while a looser rein to pleasure give  "Time flies in haste be you in haste to live  "Seize on the precious minutes as they fleet  "Your life however short will be compleat  "If at the fatal moment you can say  "I've liv'd and made the most of ev'ry day  "One precept more I fain wou'd recommend  "And then old Chiron's tedious lessens end  "Learn gen'rous prince what's little understood  "The godlike happiness of doing good  "How glorious to defend and to bestow  "From nobler springs can human pleasure flow  "A solid good which nothing can destroy  "The best prerogative the great enjoy  "For this remember monarchs first were made  "For this young prince be lov'd and be obey'd  "At once your self and mighty nations bless  "And make humanity your happiness  "But now Aurora ushers in the day  "And fond expecting Peleus chides your stay  "Go then brave youth where'er the fates may call  "Live with design and fearless wait thy fall  "Whatever space of life the gods decree  "Thy name is still immortal for I see  "More than another Peleus rise in thee  "Thy same the

SELF  By the late Dr ARBUTHNOT  WHAT am I how produc'd and for what end  Whence drew I being to what period tend  Am I th' abandon'd orphan of blind chance  Dropt by wild atoms in disorder'd dance  Or from an endless chain of causes wrought  And of unthinking substance born with thought  By motion which began without a cause  Supremely wise without design or laws  Am I but what I seem meer flesh and blood  A branching channel with a mazy flood  The purple stream that through my vessels glides  Dull and unconscious flows like common tides  The pipes through which the circling juices stray  Are not that thinking I no more than they  This frame compacted with transcendent skill  Of moving joints obedient to my will  Nurs'd from the fruitful glebe like yonder tree  Waxes and wastes I call it mine not me  New matter still the mould'ring mass sustains  The mansion chang'd the tenant still remains  And from the fleeting stream repair'd by food  Distinct as is the swimmer from the flood  What am I then sure of a nobler birth  Thy parents right I own a mother earth  But claim superior lineage by my SIRE  Who warm'd th' unthinking clod with heavenly fire  Essence divine with lifeless clay allay'd  By double nature double instinct sway'd  With look erect I dart my longing eye  Seem wing'd to part and gain my native sky  I strive to mount but strive alas in vain  Ty'd to this massy globe with magick chain  Now with swift thought I range from pole to pole  View worlds around their flaming centers roll  What steady powers their endless motions guide  Thro' the same trackless paths of boundless void  I trace the blazing comet's fiery trail  And weigh the whirling planets in a scale  These godlike thoughts while eager I pursue  Some glitt'ring trifle offer'd to my view  A gnat an insect of the meanest kind  Erase the newborn image from my mind  Some beastly want craving importunate  Vile as the grinning mastiff at my gate  Calls off from heav'nly truth this reas'ning me  And tells me I'm a brute as much as he  If on sublimer wings of love and praise  My soul above the starry vault I raise  Lur'd by some vain conceit or shameful lust  I flag I drop and flutter in the dust  The tow'ring lark thus from her lofty strain  Stoops to an emmet or a barley grain  By adverse gusts of jarring instincts tost  I rove to one now to the other coast  To bliss unknown my lofty soul aspires  My lot unequal to my vast desires  As 'mongst the hinds a child of royal birth  Finds his high pedigree by conscious worth  So man amongst his fellow brutes expos'd  Sees he's a king but 'tis a king depos'd  Pity him beasts you by no law confin'd  Are barr'd from devious paths by being blind  Whilst man through op'ning views of various ways  Confounded by the aid of knowledge strays  Too weak to choose yet choosing still in haste  One moment gives the pleasure and distaste  Bilk'd by past minutes while the present cloy  The flatt'ring future still must give the joy  Not happy but amus'd upon the road  And like you thoughtless of his last abode  Whether next sun his being shall restrain  To endless nothing happiness or pain  Around me lo the thinking thoughtless crew  Bewilder'd each their diff'rent paths pursue  Of them I ask the way the first replies  Thou art a god and sends me to the skies  Down on this turf the next thou twolegg'd beast  There fix thy lot thy bliss and endless rest  Between these wide extreams the length is such  I find I know too little or too much  "Almighty pow'r by whose most wise command  "Helpless forlorn uncertain here I stand  "Take this faint glimmering of thyself away  "Or break into my soul with perfect day"  This said expanded lay the sacred text  The balm the light the guide of souls perplex'd  Thus the benighted traveller that strays  Through doubtful paths enjoys the morning rays  The nightly mist and thick descending dew  Parting unfold the fields and vaulted blue  "O truth divine enlighten'd by thy ray  "I grope and guess no more but see my way  "Thou clear'dst the secret of my high descent  "And told me what those mystick tokens meant  "Marks of my birth which I had worn in vain  "Too hard for worldly sages to explain  "Zeno's were vain vain Epicurus' schemes  "Their systems false delusive were their dreams  "Unskill'd my twofold nature to divide  "One nurs'd by pleasure and one nurs'd by pride  "Those jarring truths which human art beguile  "Thy sacred page thus bids me reconcile"  Offspring of god no less thy pedigree  What thou once wer't art now and still may be  Thy God alone can tell alone decree  Faultless thou dropt from his unerring skill  With the bare pow'r to sin since free of will  Yet charge not with thy guilt his bounteous love  For who has power to walk has power to rove  Who acts by force impell'd can nought deserve  And wisdom short of infinite may swerve  Borne on thy newimp'd wings thou took'st thy flight  Left thy creator and the realms of light  Disdain'd his gentle precept to fulfil  And thought to grow a god by doing ill  Though by foul guilt thy heav'nly form defac'd  In nature chang'd from happy mansions chac'd  Thou still retain'st some sparks of heav'nly fire  Too faint to mount yet restless to aspire  Angel enough to seek thy bliss again  And brute enough to make thy search in vain  The creatures now withdraw their kindly use  Some fly thee some torment and some seduce  Repast ill suited to such diff'rent guests  For what thy sense desires thy soul distastes  Thy lust thy curiosity thy pride  Curb'd or deferr'd or balk'd or gratify'd  Rage on and make thee equally unbless'd  In what thou want'st and what thou hast possess'd  In vain thou hop'st for bliss on this poor clod  Return and seek thy father and thy god  Yet think not to regain thy native sky  Borne on the wings of vain philosophy  Mysterious passage hid from human eyes  Soaring you'll sink and sinking you will rise  Let humble thoughts thy wary footsteps guide

Drurylane    By the Same  WHEN learning's triumph o'er her barb'rous foes  First rear'd the stage immortal SHAKESPEAR rose  Each change of manycolour'd life he drew  Exhausted worlds and then imagin'd new  Existence saw him spurn her bounded reign  And panting time toil'd after him in vain  His pow'rful strokes presiding truth impress'd  And unresisted passion storm'd the breast  Then JOHNSON came instructed from the school  To please in method and invent by rule  His studious patience and laborious art  By regular approach essay'd the heart  Cold approbation gave the ling'ring bays  For those who durst not censure scarce cou'd praise  A mortal born he met the general doom  But left like Egypt's kings a lasting tomb  The wits of Charles found easier ways to fame  Nor wish'd for JOHNSON's art or SHAKESPEAR's flame  Themselves they studied as they felt they writ  Intrigue was plot obscenity was wit  Vice always found a sympathetick friend  They pleas'd their age and did not aim to mend  Yet bards like these aspir'd to lasting praise  And proudly hop'd to pimp in future days  Their cause was gen'ral their supports were strong  Their slaves were willing and their reign was long  Till shame regain'd the post that sense betray'd  And virtue call'd oblivion to her aid  Then crush'd by rules and weaken'd as refin'd  For years the pow'r of tragedy declin'd  From bard to bard the frigid caution crept  Till declamation roar'd while passion slept  Yet still did virtue deign the stage to tread  Philosophy remain'd though nature fled  But forc'd at length her ancient reign to quit  She saw great Faustus lay the ghost of wit  Exulting folly hail'd the joyful day  And pantomime and song confirm'd her sway  But who the coming changes can presage  And mark the future periods of the stage  Perhaps if skill could distant times explore  New Behns new Durfeys yet remain in store  Perhaps where Lear has rav'd and Hamlet dy'd  On flying cars new sorcerers may ride  Perhaps for who can guess th' effects of chance  Here Hunt may box or Mahomet may dance  Hard is his lot that here by fortune plac'd  Must watch the wild vicissitudes of taste  With ev'ry meteor of caprice must play  And chase the newblown bubbles of the day  Ah let not censure term our fate our choice  The stage but echoes back the publick voice  The drama's laws the drama's patrons give  For we that live to please must please to live  Then prompt no more the follies you decry  As tyrants doom their tools of guilt to die  'Tis yours this night to bid the reign commence  Of rescu'd nature and reviving sense  To chase the charms of sound the pomp of show  For useful mirth and salutary woe  Bid scenic virtue form the rising age  And truth diffuse her radiance from the stage  Of ACTIVE and RETIRED LIFE AN EPISTLE to  H C  Esq  Meo quidem judicio neuter culpandus alter dum expetit debitos titulos alter dum mavult videri contempsisse  PLIN Ep  By WILLIAM MELMOTH  Esq    First printed in the Year MDCCXXXV  YES you condemn those sages too refin'd  That gravely lecture ere they know mankind  Who whilst ambition's fiercer fires they blame  Would damp each useful spark that kindles fame  'Tis in false estimates the folly lies  The passion's blameless when the judgment's wise  In vain philosophers with warmth contest  Life's secret shade or open walk is best  Each has its seperate joys and each its use  This calls the patriot forth and that the muse  Hence not alike to all the species heaven  An equal thirst of publick fame has given  Patrius it forms to shine in action great  While Decio's talents best adorn retreat  If where Pierian maids delight to dwell  The haunts of silence and the peaceful cell  Had fair Astraea been thy Talbot's choice  Could list'ning crowds now hang upon his voice  And thou blest maid might'st long have wept in vain  The distant glories of a second reign  In exile doom'd yet ages to complain  Were high ambition still the pow'r confess'd  That rul'd with equal sway in ev'ry breast  Say where the glories of the sacred nine  Where Homer's verse sublime or Milton thine  Nor thou sweet bard who "turn'd the tuneful art  "From sound to sense from fancy to the heart"  Thy lays instructive to the world hadst giv'n  Nor greatly justified the ways of heav'n  Let satire blast with every mark of hate  The vain aspirer or dishonest great  Whom love of wealth or wild ambition's sway  Push forward still regardless of the way  High and more high who aim with restless pride  Where neither reason nor fair virtue guide  And Him the wretch who labors on with pain  For the low lucre of an useless gain  Wise but to get and active but to save  May scorn deserv'd still follow to the grave  But he who fond to raise a splendid name  On life's ambitious heights wou'd fix his fame  In active arts or vent'rous arms wou'd shine  Yet shuns the paths which virtue bids decline  Who dignifies his wealth by gen'rous use  To raise th' oppress'd or merit to produce  Shall reason's voice impartial e'er condemn  The glorious purpose of so wise an aim  Where virtue regulates this just desire  'Twere dang'rous folly to suppress its fire  Say whence could fame supply its force unknown  Her roll illustrious of fai  renown  What laurels prompt the hero's useful rage  What prize the patriot's weighty toils engage  Each publick passion bound to endless frost  Each deed of social worth for ever lost  O may the muse inspire the love of praise  Raise the bright passion but with judgment raise  For this she oft has tun'd her sacred voice  Call'd forth the patriot and approv'd his choice  Bid him the steep ascent to honor take  Nor till the summit gain'd her paths forsake  Yet not success alone true fame attends  He too shall reach it who but well intends  See midst the vanquish'd virtuous  He was kill'd in the civil wars see his character at large in Clarendon's history  Falkland lies  His gen'rous efforts vain and vain his sighs  Yet true to merit faithful records tell  To distant ages how the patriot fell  Blest youth insur'd the sweetest voice of praise  Who lives approv'd in Pope's unrival'd lays  Grave precepts fleeting notions may impart  But bright example best instructs the heart  Then look on Patrius let his conduct shew  From active life what various blessings flow  In him a just ambition stands confess'd  It warms but not inflames his equal breast  See him in senates act the patriot's part  Truth on his lips the publick at his heart  There neither fears can awe nor hopes controul  The honest purpose of his steady soul  No mean attachments e'er seduc'd his tongue  To gild the cause his heart suspected wrong  But deaf to envy faction spleen his voice  Joins here or there as reason guides his choice  To one great point his faithful labors tend  And all his toils in Britain's interest end  To him each neighbor safe refers his claim  The right he settles and abates the flame  Nor arts nor worth to Patrius sue in vain  Nor unreliev'd the injur'd e'er complain  For him the hand unseen are pray'rs preferr'd  And grateful vows in distant temples heard  Like nature's blessings to no part confin'd  His wellpois'd bounty reaches all mankind  That insolence of wealth the pomp of state  Which crowds the mansions of the vainly great  Flies far the limits of his modest gate  Just what is elegantly useful's there  Of aught beyond he scorns th' unworthy care  Nor wou'd for all the trim that pride can show  One single act of social aid forego  For this he labors to improve his store  For this he wishes to enlarge his pow'r  This is his life's great purpose end and aim  Such true ambition is and worthy fame  How different Rapax spent his worthless hour  With treasure indigent a slave with pow'r  Large sums o'erlooking still intent on more  He wasted not enjoy'd his tasteless store  His growing greatness rais'd his hopes the high'r  And fan'd his restless pride's increasing fire  'Twas thus amidst prosperity he pin'd  For what can fill the falseambitious mind  With all the honors that his prince cou'd give  With all the wealth his avarice receive  'Midst outward opulence but inward care  Reproach and want was all he left his heir  'Tis true the patriot well deserves his fame  And from his country just applause may claim  But what avails it to the world beside  That Brutus bravely stab'd or Curtius dy'd  While Tully's merit unconfin'd to place  Diffuses blessings down thro' all our race  Remotest times his learned labors reach  And Rome's great moralist e'en now shall teach  Averse to publick noise ambition's strife  And all the splendid ills of busy life  Thro' latent paths unmark'd by vulgar eye  Are there who wish to pass unheeded by  Whom calm retirement's sacred pleasures move  The hour contemplative or friend they love  Yet not by spleen or superstition led  Forbear ambition's giddy heights to tread  Who not inglorious spend their peaceful day  Whilst science lovely star directs their way  Flows there not something good from such as these  No useful product from the men of ease  And shall the muse no social merit boast  Are all her vigils to the publick lost  Tho' noisy pride may scorn her silent toil  Fair are the fruits which bless her happy soil  There every plant of useful produce grows  There science sprang and thence instruction flows  There true philosophy erects her school  There plans her problem and there forms her rule  There every seed of every art began  And all that eases life and brightens man  'Twas hence great Newton mighty genius soar'd  And all creation's wond'rous range explor'd  Far as th' Almighty stretch'd his utmost line  He pierc'd in thought and view'd the vast design  Too long had darker ages sought in vain  The secret scheme of nature to explain  Too long had truth escap'd each sage's eye  Or feintly shone thro' vain philosophy  Each shapeless offspring of their feeble thought  A darker veil o'er genuine science brought  Still stubborn facts o'erthrew their fruitless toil  For truth and fiction who shall reconcile  But Britain's sons a surer guide pursue  Tread safe the maze since Newton gave the clue  Wheree'er he turn'd true science rear'd her head  While far before her puzzled ign'rance fled  From each blest truth these noble ends he draws  Use to mankind and to their god applause  Taught by his rules secure the merchant rides  When threat'ning seas roll high their dreadful tides  And either India speeds her precious stores  'Midst various dangers safe to Britain's shores  Long as those orbs he weigh'd shall shed their rays  His truth shall guide us and shall last his praise  Yet if so just the fame the use so great  Systems to poise and spheres to regulate  To teach the secret welladapted force  That steers of countless orbs th' unvaried course  Far brighter honors wait the nobler part  To balance manners and conduct the heart  Order  without  us what imports it seen

Deity supremely fair  Too ost delineated with looks severe  Resume their native smiles and graces here  Sooth'd into love relenting foes admire  And warmer raptures every friend inspire  Such are the fruits which from retirement spring  These blessings ease and learned leisure bring  Yet of the various tasks mankind employ  'Tis sure the hardest leisure to enjoy  For one who knows to taste this godlike bliss  What countless swarms of vain pretenders miss  Tho' each dull plodding thing to ape the wise  Ridiculously grave for leisure sighs  His boasted wish from busy scenes to run  Grant him that leisure and the fool's undone  The gods to curse poor Demea heard his vow  And business now no more contracts his brow  No real cares 'tis true perplex his breast  But thousand fancied ills his peace molest  The slightest trifles solid sorrows prove  And the long ling'ring wheel of life scarce seems to move  Useless in business yet unfit for ease  Nor skill'd to serve mankind nor form'd to please  Such spurious animals of worthless race  Live but the publick burthen and disgrace  Like mean attendants on life's stage are seen  Drawn forth to fill but not conduct the scene  The mind not taught to think no useful store  To fix reflexion dreads the vacant hour  Turn'd on itself its num'rous wants are seen  And all the mighty void that lies within  Yet cannot wisdom stamp our joys complete  'Tis conscious virtue crowns the blest retreat  Who feels not that the private path must shun  And fly to publick view t' escape his own  In life's gay scenes uneasy thoughts suppress  And lull each anxious care in dreams of peace  'Midst foreign objects not employ'd to roam  Thought sadly active still corrodes at home  A serious moment breaks the false repose  And guilt in all its naked horror shows  He who wou'd know retirement's joy refin'd  The fair recess must seek with cheerful mind  No Cynick's pride no bigot's heated brain  No frustrate hope nor love's fantastick pain  With him must enter the sequester'd cell  Who means with pleasing solitude to dwell  But equal passions let his bosom rule  A judgment candid and a temper cool  Enlarg'd with knowledge and in conscience clear  Above life's empty hopes and death's vain fear  Such he must be who greatly lives alone  Such Portio is in crowded scenes unknown  For publick life with every talent born  Portio far off retires with decent scorn  Tho' without business never unemploy'd  And life as more at leisure more enjoy'd  For who like him can various science taste  His mind shall never want an endless feast  In his blest ev'ning walk may'st thou may I  Oft friendly join in sweet society  Our lives like his in one smooth current flow  Nor swell'd with tempest nor too calmly slow  Whilst he like some great sage of Rome or Greece  Shall calm each rising doubt and speak us peace  Correct each thought each wayward wish controul  And stamp with every virtue all the soul  Ah how unlike is Umbria's gloomy scene  Estrang'd from all the cheerful ways of men  There superstition works her baneful pow'r  And darkens all the melancholy hour  Unnumber'd fears corrode and haunt his breast  With all that whim or ign'rance can suggest  In vain for him kind nature pours her sweets  The visionary saint no joy admits  But seeks with pious spleen fantastick woes  And for heav'n's sake heav'n's offer'd good foregoes  Whate'er's our choice we still with pride prefer  And all who deviate vainly think must err  Clodio in books and abstract notions lost  Sees none but knaves and fools in honor's post  Whilst Syphax fond on fortune's sea to sail  And boldly drive before the flatt'ring gale  Forward her dang'rous ocean to explore  Condemns as cowards those who make the shore  Not so my friend impartialman he views  Useful in what he shuns as what pursues  Sees different turns to gen'ral good conspire  The hero's passion and the poet's fire  Each figure plac'd in nature's wise design  With true proportion and exactest line  Sees lights and shades unite in due degree  And form the whole with fairest symmetry  GRONGAR HILL  By Mr DYER  SILENT nymph with curious eye  Who the purple ev'ning lie  On the mountain's lonely van  Beyond the noise of busy man  Painting fair the form of things  While the yellow Linnet sings  Or the tuneful Nightingale  Charms the forest with her tale  Come with all thy various hues  Come and aid thy sister muse  Now while Phoebus riding high  Gives lustre to the land and sky  Grongar Hill invites my song  Draw the landskip bright and strong  Grongar in whose mossy cells  Sweetlymusing Quiet dwells  Grongar in whose silent shade  For the modest Muses made  So oft I have the even still  At the fountain of a rill  Sate upon a flow'ry bed  With my hand beneath my head  And stray'd my eyes o'er Towy's flood  Over mead and over wood  From house to house from hill to hill  'Till contemplation had her fill  About his chequer'd sides I wind  And leave his brooks and meads behind  And groves and grottoes where I lay  And vistoes shooting beams of day  Wider and wider spreads the vale  As circles on a smooth canal  The mountains round unhappy fate  Sooner or later of all height  Withdraw their summits from the skies  And lessen as the others rise  Still the prospect wider spreads  Adds a thousand woods and meads  Still it widens widens still  And sinks the newlyrisen hill  Now I gain the mountain's brow  What a landskip lies below  No clouds no vapours intervene  But the gay the open scene  Does the face of nature show  In all the hues of heaven's bow  And swelling to embrace the light  Spreads around beyond the sight  Old castles on the cliffs arise  Proudly tow'ring in the skies  Rushing from the woods the spires  Seem from hence ascending fires  Half his beams Apollo sheds  On the yellow mountainheads  Gilds the fleeces of the flocks  And glitters on the broken rocks  Below me trees unnumber'd rise  Beautiful in various dyes  The gloomy pine the poplar blue  The yellow beech the sable yew  The slender fir that taper grows  The sturdy oak with broadspread boughs  And beyond the purple grove  Haunt of Phillis queen of love  Gawdy as the op'ning dawn  Lies a long and level lawn  On which a dark hill steep and high  Holds and charms the wand'ring eye  Deep are his feet in Towy's flood  His sides are cloath'd with waving wood  And ancient towers crown his brow  That cast an awful look below  Whose ragged walls the ivy creeps  And with her arms from falling keeps  So both a safety from the wind  On mutual dependence find  'Tis now the raven's bleak abode  'Tis now th' apartment of the toad  And there the fox securely feeds  And there the pois'nous adder breeds  Conceal'd in ruins moss and weeds  While ever and anon there falls  Huge heaps of hoary moulder'd walls  Yet time has seen that lifts the low  And level lays the lofty brow  Has seen this broken pile compleat  Big with the vanity of state  But transient is the smile of fate  A little rule a little sway  A sunbeam in a winter's day  Is all the proud and mighty have  Between the cradle and the grave  And see the rivers how they run  Thro' woods and meads in shade and sun  Sometimes swift and sometimes slow  Wave succeeding wave they go  A various journey to the deep  Like human life to endless sleep  Thus is nature's vesture wrought  To instruct our wand'ring thought  Thus she dresses green and gay  To disperse our cares away  Ever charming ever new  When will the landskip tire the view  The fountain's fall the river's flow  The woody vallies warm and low  The windy summit wild and high  Roughly rushing on the sky  The pleasant seat the ruin'd tow'r  The naked rock the shady bow'r  The town and village dome and farm  Each give each a double charm  As pearls upon an Aethiop's arm  See on the mountain's southern side  Where the prospect opens wide  Where the ev'ning gilds the tide  How close and small the hedges lie  What streaks of meadows cross the eye  A step methinks may pass the stream  So little distant dangers seem  So we mistake the future's face  Ey'd thro' hope's deluding glass  As you summits soft and fair  Clad in colours of the air  Which to those who journey near  Barren and brown and rough appear  Still we tread the same coarse way  The present's still a cloudy day  O may I with myself agree  And never covet what I see  Content me with an humble shade  My passions tam'd my wishes laid  For while our wishes wildly roll  We banish quiet from the soul  'Tis thus the busy beat the air  And misers gather wealth and care  Now ev'n now my joy runs high  As on the mountainturf I lie  While the wanton Zephyr sings  And in the vale perfumes his wings  While the waters murmur deep  While the shepherd charms his sheep  While the birds unbounded fly  And with musick fill the sky  Now ev'n now my joy runs high  Be full ye courts be great who will  Search for Peace with all your skill  Open wide the lofty door  Seek her on the marble floor  In vain you search she is not there  In vain ye search the domes of care  Grass and flowers Quiet treads  On the meads and mountainheads  Along with Pleasure close ally'd  Ever by each other's side  And often by the murm'ring rill  Hears the thrush while all is still  Within the groves of GrongarHill  THE RUINS of ROME A POEM  By the Same  Aspice

particulars in Spenser were imagin'd most proper for the author's imitation on  this occasion  are his  language  his  simplicity  his manner of  description  and a peculiar  tenderness  of  sentiment  remarkable throughout his works  I  AH me full sorely is my heart forlorn  To think how modest worth neglected lies  While partial Fame doth with her blasts aborn  Such deeds alone as pride and pomp disguise  Deeds of ill sort and mischievous emprize  Lend me thy clarion goddess let me try  To sound the praise of merit ere it dies  Such as I oft have chaunced to espy  Lost in the dreary shades of dull obscurity  II  In ev'ry village mark'd with little spire  Embow'r'd in trees and hardly known to Fame  There dwells in lowly shed and mean attire  A matron old whom we Schoolmistress name  Who boasts unruly brats with birch to tame  They grieven sore in piteous durance pent  Aw'd by the pow'r of this relentless dame  And ofttimes on vagaries idly bent  For unkempt hair or task unconn'd are sorely shent  III  And all in sight doth rise a birchen tree  Which Learning near Her little dome did stowe  Whilom a twig of small regard to see  Tho' now so wide it's waving branches flow  And work the simple vassals mickle woe  For not a wind might curl the leaves that blew  But their limbs shudder'd and their pulse beat low  And as they look'd they found their horror grew  And shap'd it into rods and tingled at the view  IV  So have I seen who has not may conceive  A lifeless phantom near a garden plac'd  So doth it wanton birds of peace bereave  Of sport of song of pleasure of repast  They start they stare they wheel they look aghast  Sad servitude such comfortless annoy  May no bold Briton's riper age e'er taste  Ne Superstition clog his dance of joy  Ne vision empty vain his native bliss destroy  V  Near to this dome is found a patch so green  On which the tribe their gambols do display  And at the door impris'ning board is seen  Lest weakly wights of smaller size shou'd stray  Eager perdie to bask in sunny day  The noises intermix'd which thence resound  Do Learning's little tenement betray  Where sits the dame disguis'd in look profound  And eyes her fairythrong and turns her wheel around  VI  Her cap far whiter than the driven snow  Emblem right meet of decency does yield  Her apron dy'd in grain as blue I trowe  As is the Harebell that adorns the field  And in her hand for sceptre she does wield  Tway birchen sprays with anxious Fear entwin'd  With dark Distrust and sad Repentance fill'd  And stedfast Hate and sharp Affliction join'd  And Fury uncontroul'd and Chastisement unkind  VII  Few but have ken'd in semblance meet pourtray'd  The childish faces of old Eol's train  Libs Notus Auster  These in frowns array'd  How then would fare or earth or sky or main  Were the stern god to give his slaves the rein  And were not she rebellious breasts to quell  And were not she her statutes to maintain  The cott no more I ween were deem'd the cell  Where comely peace of mind and decent order dwell  VIII  A russet stole was o'er her shoulders thrown  A russet kirtle fenc'd the nipping air  'Twas simple russet but it was her own  'Twas her own country bred the flock so fair  'Twas her own labour did the fleece prepare  And sooth to say her pupils rang'd around  Thro' pious awe did term it passing rare  For they in gaping wonderment abound  And think no doubt she been the greatest wight on ground  IX  Albeit ne flatt'ry did corrupt her truth  Ne pompous title did debauch her ear  Goody goodwoman gossip n'aunt forsooth  Or dame the sole Additions she did hear  Yet these she challeng'd these she held right dear  Ne would esteem him act as mought behove  Who should not honour'd eld with these revere  For never title yet so mean could prove  But there was eke a Mind which did that title love  X  One ancient hen she took delight to feed  The plodding pattern of the busy dame  Which ever and anon impell'd by need  Into her School begirt with chickens came  Such favour did her past deportment claim  And if Neglect had lavish'd on the ground  Fragment of bread she would collect the same  For well she knew and quaintly could expound  What sin it were to waste the smallest crumb she sound  XI  Herbs too she knew and well of each could speak  That in her garden sip'd the silv'ry dew  Where no vain flow'r disclos'd a gawdy streak  But herbs for use and physick not a few  Of grey renown within those borders grew  The tufted Basil punprovoking Tyme  Fresh Baum and Marygold of chearful hue  The lowly Gill that never dares to climb  And more I fain would sing disdaining here to rhime  XII  Yet Euphrasy may not be left unsung  That gives dim eyes to wander leagues around  And pungent Radish biting infant's tongue  And Plantain ribb'd that heals the reaper's wound  And Marj'ram sweet in shepherd's posie found  And Lavender whose spikes of azure bloom  Shall be erewhile in arid bundles bound  To lurk amidst the labours of her loom  And crown her kerchiefs clean with mickle rare perfume  XIII  And here trim Rosmarine that whilom crown'd  The dantiest garden of the proudest peer  Ere driven from its envy'd site it found  A sacred shelter for it's branches here  Where edg'd with gold it's glitt'ring skirts appear  Oh wastel days O customs meet and well  Ere this was banish'd from its lofty sphere  Simplicity then sought this humble cell  Nor ever would She more with thane or lordling dwell  XIV  Here oft the dame on Sabbath's decent eve  Hymned such psalms as Sternhold forth did mete  If winter 'twere she to her hearth did cleave  But in her garden found a summer seat  Sweet melody to hear her then repeat  How Israel's sons beneath a foreign king  While taunting foemen did a song intreat  All for the Nonce untuning ev'ry string  Up hung their useless lyressmall heart had they to sing  XV  For she was just and friend to virtuous lore  And pass'd much time in truly pious deed  And in those Elfins' ears would oft deplore  The times when truth by Popish rage did bleed  And tortious death was true devotion's meed  And simple faith in iron chains did mourn  That would on wooden image place her creed  And lawny saints in smould'ring flames did burn  Ah dearest Lord forefend thilk days should e'er return  XVI  In elbowchair like that of Scotish stem  By the sharp tooth of cank'ring eld defac'd  In which when he receives his diadem  Our sovereign prince and liefest liege is plac'd  The matron sate and some with rank she grac'd  The source of children's and of courtier's pride  Redress'd affronts for vile affronts there pass'd  And warn'd them not the fretful to deride  But love each other dear whatever them betide  XVII  Right well she knew each temper to descry  To thwart the proud and the submiss to raise  Some with vile copper prize exalt on high  And some entice with pittance small of praise  And other some with baleful sprig she 'frays  Ev'n absent she the reins of pow'r doth hold  While with quaint arts the giddy crowd she sways  Forewarn'd if little bird their pranks behold  'Twill whisper in her ear and all the scene unfold  XVIII  Lo now with state she utters the command  Eftsoons the urchins to their tasks repair  Their books of stature small they take in hand  Which with pellucid horn secured are  To save from finger wet the letter's fair  The work so gay that on their backs is seen  St George's high atchievements does declare  On which thilk wight that has ygazing been  Kens the forthcoming rod unpleasing sight I ween  XIX  Ah luckless he and born beneath the beam  Of evil star it irks me whilst I write  As erst the  Spenser  bard by Mulla's silver stream  Oft as he told of deadly dolorous plight  Sigh'd as he sung and did in tears indite  For brandishing the rod she doth begin  To loose the brogues the stripling's late delight  And down they drop appears his dainty skin  Fair as the furry coat of whitest Ermilin  XX  O ruthful scene when from a nook obscure  His little sister doth his peril see  All playful as she sate she grows demure  She finds full soon her wonted spirits flee  She meditates a pray'r to set him free  Nor gentle pardon could this dame deny  If gentle pardon could with dames agree  To her sad grief that swells in either eye  And wrings her so that all for pity she could dye  XXI  Nor longer can she now her shrieks command  And hardly she forbears thro' awful fear  To rushen forth and with presumptuous hand  To stay harsh justice in its mid career  On thee she calls on thee her parent dear  Ah too remote to ward the shameful blow  She sees no kind domestick visage near  And soon a flood of tears begins to flow  And gives a loose at last to unavailing woe  XXII  But ah what pen his piteous plight may trace  Or what device his loud laments explain  The form uncouth of his disguised face  The pallid hue that dies his looks amain  The plenteous show'r that does his cheek distain  When he in abject wise implores the dame  Ne hopeth ought of sweet reprieve to gain  Or when from high she levels well her aim  And thro' the thatch his cries each falling stroke proclaim  XXIII  The other tribe aghast with sore dismay  Attend and conn their tasks with mickle care  By turns astony'd ev'ry twig survey  And from their fellow's hateful wounds beware  Knowing I wist how each the same may share  Till Fear has taught them a performance meet  And to the wellknown chest the dame repair  Whence oft with sugar'd cates she doth 'em greet  And gingerbread yrare now certes doubly sweet  XXIV  See to their seats they hye with merry glee  And in beseemly order sitten there  All but the wight of bum ygalled he  Abhorreth bench and stool and fourm and chair  This hand in mouth yfix'd that rends his hair  And eke with snubs profound and heaving breast  Convulsions intermitting does declare  His grievous wrong his dame's unjust behest  And scorns her offer'd love and shuns to be caress'd  XXV  His face besprent with liquid crystal shines  His blooming face that seems a purple flow'r  Which low to earth it's drooping head declines  All smear'd and sully'd by a vernal show'r  O the hard bosoms of despotick pow'r  All all but she the author of his shame  All all but she regret this mournful hour  Yet hence the youth and hence the flow'r shall claim  If so I deem aright transcending worth and fame  XXVI  Behind some door in melancholy thought  Mindless of food he dreary caitiff pines  Ne for his fellow's joyaunce careth ought  But to the wind all merriment resigns  And deems it shame if he to peace inclines  And many a sullen look ascance is sent  Which for his dame's annoyance he designs  And still the more to pleasure him she's bent  The more doth he perverse her haviour past resent  XXVII  Ah me how much I fear lest pride it be  But if that pride it be which thus inspires  Beware ye dames with nice discernment see  Ye quench not too the sparks of nobler fires  Ah better far than all the muses' lyres  All coward arts is valour's gen'rous heat  The firm fix'd breast which Fit and Right requires  Like Vernon's patriot soul more justly great  Than craft that pimps for ill or flow'ry false deceit  XXVIII  Yet nurs'd with skill what dazling fruits appear  Ev'n now sagacious Foresight points to show  A little bench of heedless bishops here  And there a chancellour in embryo  Or bard sublime if bard may e'er be so  As Milton Shakespeare names that ne'er shall dye  Tho' now he crawl along the ground so low  Nor weeting how the muse shou'd soar on high  Wisheth poor starvling elf his paperkite may fly  XXIX  And this perhaps who cens'ring the Design  Low lays the house which that of cards doth build  Shall Dennis be if rigid fates incline  And many an Epick to his rage shall yield  And many a poet quit th' Aonian field  And sour'd by age profound he shall appear  As he who now with 'sdeignfull fury thrill'd  Surveys mine work and levels many a sneer  And furls his wrinkly front and cries "What stuff is here"  XXX  But now Dan Phoebus gains the middle skie  And Liberty unbars their prisondoor  And like a rushing torrent out they fly  And now the grassy cirque han cover'd o'er  With boist'rous revelrout and wild uproar  A thousand ways in wanton rings they run  Heav'n shield their shortliv'd pastimes I implore  For well may freedom erst so dearly won  Appear to British elf more gladsome than the sun  XXXI  Enjoy poor imps enjoy your sportive trade  And chase gay flies and cull the fairest flow'rs  For when my bones in grassgreen sods are laid  For never may ye taste more careless hours  In knightly castles or in ladies bow'rs  O vain to seek delight in earthly thing  But most in courts where proud ambition tow'rs  Deluded wight who weens fair peace can spring  Beneath the pompous dome of Kesar or of king  XXXII  See in each sprite some various bent appear  These rudely carol most incondite lay  Those saunt'ring on the green with jocund leer  Salute the stranger passing on his way  Some builden fragile tenements of clay  Some to the standing lake their courses bend  With pebbles smooth at Duck and Drake to play  Thilk to the huxter's sav'ry cottage tend  In pastry kings and queens th' allotted mite to spend  XXXIII  Here as each season yields a different store  Each season's stores in order ranged been  Apples with cabbagenet ycover'd o'er  Galling full sore th' unmoney'd wight are seen  And gooseb'rie clad in liv'ry red or green  And here of lovely dye the Cath'rinepear  Fine pear as lovely for thy juice I ween  O may no wight e'er pennyless come there  Lest smit with ardent love he pine with hopeless care  XXXIV  See cherries here ere cherries yet abound  With thread so white in tempting posies ty'd  Scatt'ring like blooming maid their glances round  With pamper'd look draw little eyes aside  And must be bought tho' penury betide  The plumb all azure and the nut all brown  And here each season do those cakes abide  Whose honour'd names th' inventive city own  Rend'ring thro' Britain's isle Salopia's praises known  Shrewsbury cakes  XXXV  Admir'd Salopia that with venial pride  Eyes her bright form in Severn's ambient wave  Fam'd for her loyal cares in perils try'd  Her daughters lovely and her striplings brave  Ah midst the rest may flow'rs adorn His grave  Whose art did first these dulcet cates display  A motive fair to Learning's imps he gave  Who chearless o'er her darkling region stray  'Till reason's morn arise and light them on their way  THE ART of POLITICKS In IMITATION of  HORACE  's ART of POETRY  By the Reverend Mr BRAMSTON  Humano capiti cervicem pictor equinam  Jungere si velit varias inducere plumas  Undique collatis membris ut turpiter atrum  Definat in piscem mulier formosa

gelding's mane and feathers of maccaw  A lady's bosom and a tail of cod  Who could help laughing at a sight so odd  Just such a monster Sirs pray think before ye  When you behold one man both Whig and Tory  Not more extravagant are drunkard's dreams  Than Lowchurch politicks with Highchurch schemes  Painters you'll say may their own fancies use  And freeborn Britons may their party chuse  That's true I own but can one piece be drawn  For dove and dragon elephant and fawn  Incoeptis gravibus plerumque magna professis  Purpureus late qui splendeat unus alter  Assuitur pannus cum lucus ara

their speeches blend  Begin like patriots and like courtiers end  Some love to roar the constitution's broke  And others on the nation's debts to joke  Some  ail they hate a commonwealth so much  Whate'er the subject be against the Dutch  While others with more fashionable fury  Begin with turnpikes and conclude with Fleury  Some when th'affair was Blenheim's glorious battle  Declaim'd against importing Irish cattle  But you from whate'er side you take your name  Like Anna's motto always be the same  Decipimur specie recti brevis esse laboro  Obscurus fio sectantem laevia nervi  Deficiunt

nigroque capillo  Outsides deceive 'tis hard the truth to know  Parties from quaint denominations flow  As Scotch and Irish antiquaries show  The low are said to take Fanaticks parts  The high are bloody Papists in their hearts  Caution and fear to highest faults have run  In pleasing both the parties you please none  Who in the house affects declaiming airs  Whales in Changealley paints in Fishstreet bears  Some metaphors some handkerchiefs display  These peep in hats while those with buttons play  And make me think it Repetition day  There knights haranguing hug a neighb'ring post  And are but quoram orators at most  Sooner than thus my want of sense expose  I'll deck out bandylegs with goldclock'dhose  Or wear a toupetwig without a nose  Nay I would sooner have thy phyz I swear  Surintendant des plaisirs d'Angleterre  All Mr Heydegger's letters come directed to him from abroad  A Monsieur Monsieur Heydegger surintendant des plaisirs d'Angleterre    Sumite materiam vestris qui

merit everlasting fame  If you can quibble on Sir Robert's name  In stateaffairs use not the vulgar phrase  Talk words scarce known in good queen Besse's days  New terms let war or traffick introduce  And try to bring persuadingships in use  Coin words in coining ne'er mind common sense  Provided the original be French  licuit semperque licebit  Signatum praesente not a procudere nomen  Ut sylvae

words at all  Did aught our predecessors genius cramp  Sure ev'ry reign may have its proper stamp  All sublunary things of death partake  What alteration does a cent'ry make  Kings and comedians all are mortal found  Caesar and Pinkethman are under ground  What's not destroy'd by Time's devouring hand  Where's Troy and where's the Maypole in the Strand  Pease cabbages and turnips once grew where  Now stands New Bondstreet and a newer square  Such piles of buildings now rise up and down  London itself seems going out of town  Our fathers cross'd from Fulham in a wherry  Their sons enjoy a bridge at Putneyferry  Think we that modern words eternal are  Toupet and Tompion Cosins and Colmar  Hereafter will be call'd by some plain man  A wig a watch a pair of stays a fan  To things themselves if time such change affords  Can there be any trusting to our words  Res gestae regumque ducumque tristia bella  Quo scribi possent numero monstravit Homerus  Versibus impariter junctis

a secret and the world's in doubt  Musa dedit fidibus Divos puerosque Deorum  Et pugilem victorem equum certamine primum  Et juvenum curas libera vina referre  Not long since parishclerks with saucy airs  Apply'd king David's psalms to state affairs  Some certain tunes to politicks belong  On both sides drunkards love a partysong  Descriptas servare vices operumque colores  Cur ego si nequeo

rhyme  An Act of Parliament's a serious thing  Begins with year of lord and year of king  Keeps close to form in every word is strict  When it would pains and penalties inflict  Soft words suit best petitioner's intent  Soft words O ye petitioners of Kent  Non satis est pulchra esse Poemata dulcia sunto  Ut ridentibus arrident ita flentibus adsunt  Humani vultus si vis me flere dolendum est  Primum ipse tibi tunc tua me infortunia laedent  Telephe vel Peleu male si mandata loquêris  Aut dormitabo aut ridebo  Whoe'er harangues before he gives his vote  Should send sweet language from a tuneful throat  Pultney the coldest breast with zeal can fire  And Roman thoughts by Attick stile inspire  He knows from tedious wranglings to beguile  The serious house into a chearful smile  When the great patriot paints his anxious fears  For England's safety I am lost in tears  But when dull speakers strive to move compassion  I pity their poor hearers not the nation  Unless young members to

to your God  Nor bully when in custody o'th'rod  Look grave and be from jokes and grinning far  When brought to sue for pardon at the bar  If then you let your illtim'd wit appear  Knights citizens and burgesses will sneer  Intererit multum Davusne loquatur an Heros  Mercatorne vagus cultorne virent's agelli  Colchus an Assyrius Thebis nutritus an Argis  For land or trade not the same notions

To likelihood your characters confine  Don't turn Sir Paul out let Sir Paul resign  In Walpole's voice if factions ill intend  Give the two universities a friend  Give Maidstone wit and elegance refin'd  To both the Pelhams give the Scipio's mind  To Cart'ret learning eloquence and parts  To George the second give all English hearts  Siquid inexpertum scenae committis audes  Personam formare

no member is debarr'd  But funds and national accounts are hard  Safer on common topicks to discourse  The malttax and a military force  On these each coffeehouse will lend a hint  Besides a thousand things that are in print  But steal not word for word nor thought for thought  For you'll be teaz'd to death if you are caught  When factious leaders boast increasing strength  Go not too far nor

hear a lion in the lobby roar  Say Mr Speaker shall we shut the door  And keep him there or shall we let him in  To try if we can turn him out again  Non fumum ex fulgore sed ex fumo dare lucem

Some Rufus some the Conqueror bring in  And some from Julius Caesar's days begin  A cunning speaker can command his chops  And when the house is not in humour stops  In falsehood probability imploys

Shippen or Sir William Yonge  If in one chase he can two horses kill  He cares not twopence for the landtax bill  Loud in his wine in women not o'er nice  He damns his uncles if they give advice  Votes as his father did when there's a call  But had much rather never vote at all  Conversis studiis aetas animusque virilis  Quaerit opes amicitias inservit honori  Commisisse cavet quod mox mutare

When the duke's grandson for the county stood  His beef was fat and his october good  His lordship took each ploughman by the fist  Drunk to their sons their wives and daughters kiss'd  But when

Sate thrice but spoke not once in parliament  Two good estates are goneWho'll take his word  Oh should his uncle die he'd spend a third  He'd buy a house his happiness to crown  Within a mile of some good boroughtown  Tag rag and bobtail to sir Harry's run  Men that have votes and women that have none  Sons daughters grandsons with his honour dine  He keeps a publickhouse without a sign  Coblers and smiths extol th' ensuing choice  And drunken taylors boast their right of voice  Dearly the freeborn neighbourhood is bought  They never leave him while he's worth a groat  So leeches stick nor quit the bleeding wound  Till off they drop with skinfuls to the ground  THE MAN of TASTE OCCASION'D by an EPISTLE Of Mr POPE's on that Subject  By the Same  WHoe'er he be that to a Taste aspires  Let him read this and be what he desires  In men and manners vers'd from life I write  Not what was once but what is now polite  Those who of courtly France have made the tour  Can scarce our English awkwardness endure  But honest men who never were abroad  Like England only and its Taste applaud  Strife still subsists which yields the better goût  Books or the world the many or the few  True Taste to me is by this touchstone known  That's always best that's nearest to my own  To shew that my pretensions are not vain  My father was a play'r in Drurylane  Pears and pistachionuts my mother sold  He a dramaticpoet she a scold  His tragick muse could countesses affright  Her wit in boxes was my lord's delight  No mercenary priest e'er join'd their hands  Uncramp'd by wedlock's unpoetick bands  Laws my Pindarick parents matter'd not  So I was tragicomically got  My infant tears a sort of measure kept  I squall'd in distichs and in triplets wept  No youth did I in education waste  Happy in an hereditary Taste  Writing ne'er cramp'd the sinews of my thumb  Nor barb'rous birch e'er brush'd my tender bum  My guts ne'er suffer'd from a college cook  My name ne'er enter'd in a butterybook  Grammar in vain the sons of Priscian teach  Good parts are better than eight parts of speech  Since these declin'd those undeclin'd they call  I thank my stars that I declin'd them all  To Greek or Latin tougues without pretence  I trust to mother wit and father sense  Nature's my guide all sciences I scorn  Pains I abhor I was a Poet born  Yet is my goût for criticism such  I've got some french and know a little Dutch  Huge commentators grace my learned shelves  Notes upon books outdo the books themselves  Criticks indeed are valuable men  But hypercriticks are as good agen  Tho' Blackmore's works my soul with raptures fill  With notes by bently they'd be better still  The BoghouseMiscellany's well design'd  To ease the body and improve the mind  Swift's whims and jokes for my resentment call  For he displeases me that pleases all  Verse without rhyme I never could endure  Uncouth in numbers and in sense obscure  To him as nature when he ceas'd to see  Milton's an universal blank to me  Confirm'd and settled by the nation's voice  Rhyme is the poet's pride and people's choice  Always upheld by national support  Of market university and court  Thompson write blank but know that for that reason  These lines shall live when thine are out of season  Rhyme binds and beautifies the poet's lays  As London ladies owe their shape to stays  Had Cibber's self the Careless Husband wrote  He for the laurel ne'er had had my vote  But for his epilogues and other plays  He thoroughly deserves the modern bays  It pleases me that Pope unlaurell'd goes  While Cibber wears the bays for playhouse prose  So Britain's monarch once uncover'd sate  While Bradshaw bully'd in a broadbrimm'd hat  Long live old Curl he ne'er to publish fears  The speeches verses and last wills of peers  How oft has he a publick spirit shewn  And pleas'd our ears regardless of his own  But to give merit due though Curl's the fame  Are not his brother booksellers the same  Can statutes keep the British press in awe  While that sells best that's most against the law  Lives of dead play'rs my leisure hours beguile  And Sessionspapers tragedize my stile  'Tis charming reading in Ophelia's life  So oft a mother and not once a wife  She could with just propriety behave  Alive with peers with monarchs in her grave  Her lot how oft have envious harlots wept  By prebends bury'd and by generals kept  T'improve in morals Mandevil I read  And Tyndal's scruples are my settled creed  I travell'd early and I soon saw through  Religion all ere I was twentytwo  Shame pain or poverty shall I endure  When ropes or opium can my ease procure  When money's gone and I no debts can pay  Selfmurder is an honourable way  As Pasaran directs I'd end my life  And kill myself my daughter and my wife  Burn but that Bible which the parson quotes  And men of spirit all shall cut their throats  But not to writings I confine my pen  I have a taste for buildings musick men  Young travell'd coxcombs mighty knowledge boast  With superficial smatterings at most  Not so my mind unsatisfied with hints  Knows more than Budgel writes or Roberts prints  I know the town all houses I have seen  From HighPark corner down to BednalGreen  Sure wretched Wren was taught by bungling Jones  To murder mortar and disfigure stones  Who in Whitehall can symmetry discern  I reckon Coventgarden church a barn  Nor hate I less thy vile cathedral Paul  The choir's too big the cupola's too small  Substantial walls and heavy roofs I like  'Tis Vanbrug's structures that my fancy strike  Such noble ruins ev'ry pile wou'd make  I wish they'd tumble for the prospect's sake  To lofty Chelsea or to Greenwich dome  Soldiers and Sailors all are welcom'd home  Her poor to palaces Britannia brings  St James's hospital may serve for kings  Buildings so happily I understand  That for one house I'd mortgage all my land  Dorick Ionick shall not there be found  But it shall cost me threescorce thousand pound  From out my honest workmen I'll select  A Bricklay'r and proclaim him architect  First bid him build me a stupendous dome  Which having finish'd we set out for Rome  Take a week's view of Venice and the Brent  Stare round see nothing and come home content  I'll have my Villa too a sweet abode  Its situation shall be London road  Pots o'er the door I'll place like Cits balconies  Which  Bentley's Milton Book ver  Bentley calls the Gardens of Adonis  I'll have my Gardens in the fashion too  For what is beautiful that is not new  Fair fourlegg'd temples theatres that vye  With all the angles of a Christmaspye  Does it not merit the beholder's praise  What's high to sink and what is low to raise  Slopes shall ascend where once a greenhouse stood  And in my horsepond I will plant a wood  Let misers dread the hoarded gold to waste  Expence and alteration shew a Taste  In curious paintings I'm exceeding nice  And know their several beauties by their price  Auctions and sales I constantly attend  But chuse my pictures by a skilful friend  Originals and copies much the same  The picture's value is the painter's name  My taste in sculpture from my choice is seen  I buy no statues that are not obscene  In spite of Addison and ancient Rome  Sir Cloudesly Shovel's is my fav'rite tomb  How oft have I with admiration stood  To view some citymagistrate in wood  I gaze with pleasure on a lordmayor's head  Cast with propriety in gilded lead  Oh could I view through London as I pass  Some broad Sir Balaam in Corinthian brass  High on a pedestal ye freemen place  His magisterial paunch and griping face  Letter'd and gilt let him adorn Cheapside  And grant the tradesman what a king's deny'd  Old coins and medals I collect 'tis true  Sir Andrew has 'em and I'll have 'em too  But among friends if I the truth might speak  I like the modern and despise th' antique  Tho' in the draw'rs of my japan bureau  To lady Gripeall I the Caesars shew  'Tis equal to her ladyship or me  A copper Otho or a Scotch baubeè  Without Italian or without an ear  To Bononcini's musick I adhere  Musick has charms to sooth a savage beast  And therefore proper at a sheriff's feast  My soul has oft a secret pleasure found  In the harmonious bagpipe's lofty sound  Bagpipes for men shrill Germanflutes for boys  I'm English born and love a grumbling noise  The stage should yield the solemn organ's note  And scripture tremble in the eunuch's throat  Let Senesino sing what David writ  And hallelujahs charm the pious pit  Eager in throngs the town to Hester came  And Oratorio was a lucky name  Thou Heideggre the English taste hast found  And rul'st the mob of quality with sound  In Lent if Masquerades displease the town  Call 'em Ridotto's and they still go down  Go on prince Phyz to please the British Nation  Call thy next Masquerade a Convocation  Bears lions wolves and elephants I breed  And Philosophical Transactions read  Next lodge I'll be FreeMason nothing less  Unless I happen to be F R S  I have a palate and as yet two ears  Fit company for porters or for peers  Of ev'ry useful knowledge I've a share  But my top talent is a bill of fare  Sir loins and rumps of beef offend my eyes  Pleas'd with frogs fricasseed and coxcombpies  Dishes I chuse though little yet genteel  Snails the first course and peepers crown the meal  Pigs heads with hair on much my fancy please  I love young collyflow'rs if stew'd in cheese  And give ten guineas for a pint of peas  No tatling servants to my table come  My grace is silence and my waiter dumb  Queer countryputs extol queen Bess's reign  And of lost hospitality complain  Say thou that do'st thy father's table praise  Was there mahogena in former days  Oh could a British barony be sold  I would bright honour buy with dazling gold  Could I the privilege of peer procure  The rich I'd bully and oppress the poor  To give is wrong but it is wronger still  On any terms to pay a tradesman's bill  I'd make the insolent mechanicks stay  And keep my ready money all for play  I'd try if any pleasure could be found  In tossing up for twentythousand pound  Had I whole counties I to White's would go  And set land woods and rivers at a throw  But should I meet with an unlucky run  And at a throw be gloriously undone  My debts of honour I'd discharge the first  Let all my lawful creditors be curs'd  My title would preserve me from arrest  And seising hired horses is a jest  I'd walk the morning with an oaken stick  With gloves and hat like my own footman Dick  A footman I wou'd be in outward show  In sense and education truly so  As for my head it should ambiguous wear  At once a periwig and its own hair  My hair I'd powder in the women's way  And dress and talk of dressing more than they  I'll please the maids of honour if I can  Without blackvelvet breeches what is man  I will my skill in buttton holes display  And brag how oft I shift me ev'ry day  Shall I wear cloaths in awkward England made  And sweat in cloth to help the woollen trade  In French embroid'ry and in Flanders lace  I'll spend the income of a treasurer's place  Deard's bill for baubles shall to thousands mount  And I'd outdi'mond even the di'mond count  I would convince the world by taudry cloaths  That Belles are less effeminate than beaux  And doctor Lamb should pare my lordship's toes  To boon companions I my time would give  With players pimps and parasites I'd live  I would with jockeys from Newmarket dine  And to roughriders give my choicest wine  I would caress some stableman of note  And imitate his language and his coat  My ev'nings all I would with sharpers spend  And make the thief catcher my bosom friend  In Fig the prizefighter by day delight  And sup with Colley Cibber ev'ry night  Should I perchance be fashionably ill  I'd send for Misaubin and take his pill  I should abhor though in the utmost need  Arbuthnot Hollins Wigan Lee or Mead  But if I found that I grew worse and worse  I'd turn off Misaubin and take a nurse  How oft when eminent physicians fail  Do good old women's remedies prevail  When beauty's gone and Chloe's struck with years  Eyes she can couch or she can syringe ears  Of graduates I dislike the learned rout  And chuse a female doctor for the gout  Thus would I live with no dull pedants curs'd  Sure of all blockheads scholars are the worst  Back to your Universities ye fools  And dangle arguments on strings in schools  Those schools which Universities they call  'Twere well for England were there none at all  With ease that loss the nation might sustain  Supply'd by Goodman'sfields and Drurylane  Oxford and Cambridge are not worth one farthing  Compar'd to Haymarket and Coventgarden  Quit those ye British youth and follow these  Turn players all and take your squires degrees  Boast not your incomes now as heretofore  Ye booklearn'd seats the theatres have more  Ye stiffrump'd heads of colleges be dumb  A single eunuch gets a larger sum  Have some of you three hundred by the year  Booth Rich and Cibber twice three thousand clear  Should Oxford to her sister Cambridge join  A year's rackrent and arbitrary fine  Thence not one winter's charge would be defray'd  For playhouse opera ball and masquerade  Glad I congratulate the judging age  The players are the world the world the stage  I am a politician too and hate  Of any party ministers of state  I'm for an Act that he who sev'n whole years  Has serv'd his king and country lose his ears  Thus from my birth I'm qualified you find  To give the laws of Taste to human kind  Mine are the gallant schemes of politesse  For books and buildings politicks and dress  This is true Taste and whoso likes it not  Is blockhead coxcomb puppy fool and sot  AN ESSAY ON CONVERSATION  By BENJAMIN STILLINGFLEET  Oderunt hilarem tristes tristemque jocosi  Sedatum celeres agilem gnavumque remissi  HORAT  THE art of converse how to sooth the soul  Of haughty man his passions to controul  His pride at once to humble and to please  And join the dignity of life with ease  Be now my Theme O thou whom nature's hand  Fram'd for this best this delicate command  And taught when lisping without reason's aid  At the same time to speak and to persuade  WYNDHAM with diligence awhile attend  Nor scorn th' instructions of an older friend  Who when the world's great commerce shall have join'd  The deep reflection and the strength of mind  To the bright talents of thy youthful state  In turn shall on thy better lessons wait  Whence comes it that in every art we see  Many can rise to a supreme degree  Yet in this art for which all seem design'd  By nature scarcely one compleat we find  You'll say perhaps we think we speak we move  By the strong springs alone of selfish love  Yet among all the species is there one  Whom with more caution than ourselves we shun  What is it fills a puppetshew or court  Go none but for the profit or the sport  If so why comes each soul fatigu'd away  And curses the dull puppets same dull play  Yet unconvinc'd is tempted still to go  'Tis that we find at home our greatest foe  And reason good why solitude we flee  Can wants with selfsufficiency agree  Yet such our inconsistency of mind  We court society and hate mankind  With some we quarrel for they're too sincere  With others for they're close reserv'd and queer  This is too learn'd too prudent or too wise  And that we for his ignorance despise  A voice perhaps our ear shall harshly strike  Then strait e'en wit itself shall raise dislike  Our eye may by some feature be annoy'd  Behold at once a character destroy'd  One's so goodnatur'd he's beyond all bearing  He'll ridicule no friend tho' out of hearing  Another warm'd with zeal offends our eyes  Because he holds the mirror up to vice  No wonder then since fancies wild as these  Can move our spleen that real faults displease  When Maevius spite of dullness will be bright  And teach ARGYLL to speak and SWIFT to write  When Flavia entertains us with her dreams  And Macer with his no less airy schemes  When peevishness and jealousy and pride  And int'rest that can brother hearts divide  In their imagin'd forms our eyesight hit  Of an old maid a poet peer or cit  Can then you'll say philosophy refrain  And check the torrent of each boiling vein  Yes She can still do more view passion's slave  With mind serene indulge him and yet save  But selfconceit steps in and with strict eye  Scans every man and every man awry  That reigning passion which thro' every stage  Of life still haunts us with unceasing rage  No quality so mean but what can raise  Some drudging driveling candidate for praise  E'en in the wretch who wretches can despise  Still selfconceit will find a time to rise  Quintus salutes you with forbidding face  And thinks he carries his excuse in lace  You ask why Clodius bullies all he can  Clodius will tell you he's a gentleman  Myrtilla struts and  udders half the year  With a round cap that shews a fine turn'd ear  The lowest jest makes Delia laugh to death  Yet she's no fool she has only handsome teeth  Ventoso lolls and scorns all humankind  From the gilt coach with four lac'd slaves behind  Does all this pomp and state proceed from merit  Mean thought he deems it nobler to inherit  While fopling from some title draws his pride  Meanless or infamous or misapply'd  Freemason rake or wit 'tis just the same  The charm is hence he has gain'd himself a name  Yet spite of all the fools that pride has made  'Tis not on man an useless burthen laid  Pride has ennobled some and some disgrac'd  It hurts not in itself but as 'tis plac'd  When right its view knows none but vertue's bound  When wrong it scarcely looks one inch around  Mark with what care the fair one's critick eye  Scan's o'er her dress nor lets a fault slip by  Each rebel hair must be reduc'd to place  With tedious skill and tortur'd into grace  Betty must o'er and o'er the pins dispose  'Till into modish folds the drapery flows  And the whole frame is fitted to express  The charms of decency and nakedness  Why all this art this labour'd ornament  To captivate you'll cry no doubt 'tis meant  True But let's wait upon this fair machine  From the lone closet to the social scene  There view her loud affected scornful sour  Paining all others and herself still more  What means she at one instant to disgrace  The labour of ten hours her muchlov'd face  Why 'tis the selfsame passion gratify'd  The work is ruin'd that was rais'd by pride  Yet of all tempers it requires least pain  Could we but rule ourselves to rule the vain  The prudent is by reason only sway'd  With him each sentence and each word is weigh'd  The gay and giddy can alone be caught  By the quick lustre of a happy thought  The miser hates unless he steals your pelf  The prodigal unless you rob yourself  The lewd will shun you if your wife prove chaste  The jealous if a smile on his be cast  The steady or the whimsical will blame  Either because you're not or are the same  The peevish sullen shrewd luxurious rash  Will with your vertue peace or interest clash  But mark the proud man's price how very low  'Tis but a civil speech a smile or bow  Ye who push'd on by noble ardour aim  In social life to gain immortal fame  Observe the various passions of mankind  General peculiar single or combin'd  How youth from manhood differs in its views  And how old age still other paths pursues  How zeal in Priscus nothing more than heats  In Codex burns and ruins all it meets  How freedom now a lovely face shall wear  Now shock us in the likeness of a bear  How jealousy in some resembles hate  In others seems but love grown delicate  How modesty is often pride refin'd  And vertue but the canker of the mind  How love of riches grandeur life and fame  Wear different shapes and yet are still the same  But not our passions only disagree  In taste is found as great variety  Sylvius is ravish'd when he hears a hound  His lady hates to death the odious sound  Yet both love musick tho' in different ways  He in a kennel she at opera's  A florist shall perhaps not grudge some hours  To view the colours in a bed of flowers  Yet shew him TITIAN's workmanship divine  He passes on and only cries 'tis fine  A rusty coin an old wormeaten post  The mouldy fragment of an author lost  A butterfly an equipage a star  A globe a fine lac'd head a china jar  A mistress or a fashion that is new  Have each their charms tho' felt but by a few  Then study each man's passions and his taste  The first to soften and indulge the last  Not like the wretch who beats down vertue's fence  And deviates from the paths of common sense  Who daubs with fulsom flattery blind and bold  The very weakness we with grief behold  Passions are common to the fool and wise  And all would hide them under art's disguise  For so avow'd in others is their shame  None hates them more than he who has the same  But taste seems more peculiarly our own  And every man is fond to make his known  Proud of a mark he fancies is design'd  By nature to advance him o'er his kind  And where he sees that character impress'd  With joy he hugs the favourite to his breast  But the main stress of all our cares must lie  To watch ourselves with strict and constant eye  To mark the working mind when passions' course  Begins to swell and reason still has force  Or if she's conquer'd by the stronger tide  Observe the moments when they first subside  For he who hopes a victory to win  O'er other men must with himself begin  Else like a town by mutiny oppress'd  He's ruin'd by the foe within his breast  And they alone who in themselves oft view  Man's image know what method to pursue  All other creatures keep in beaten ways  Man only moves in an eternal maze  He lives and dies not tam'd by cultivation  The wretch of reason and the dupe of passion  Curious of knowing yet too proud to learn  More prone to doubt than anxious to discern  Tir'd with old doctrines prejudic'd at new  Mistaking still the pleasing for the true  Foe to restraints approv'd by general voice  Yet to each foolborn mode a slave by choice  Of rest impatient yet in love with ease  When most goodnatur'd aiming how to teaze  Disdaining by the vulgar to be aw'd  Yet never pleas'd but when the fools applaud  By turns severe indulgent humble vain  A trifle serves to lose him or to gain  Then grant this trifle yet his vices shun  Not like to CATO or to  Alcibiades  CLINIAS' son  This for each humour every shape could take  Ev'n vertue's own tho' not for vertue's sake  At Athens rakish thoughtless full of fire  Severe at Sparta as a Chartreux fryar  In Thrace a bully drunken rash and rude  In Asia gay effeminate and lewd  While the rough Roman vertue's rigid friend  Cou'd not to save the cause he dy'd for bend  In him 'twas scarce an honour to be good  He more indulg'd a passion than subdu'd  See how the skilful lover spreads his toils  When eager in pursuit of beauty's spoils  Behold him bending at his idol's feet  Humble not mean disputing and yet sweet  In rivalship not fierce nor yet unmov'd  Without a rival studious to be lov'd  For ever chearful tho' not always witty  And never giving cause for hate or pity  These are his arts such arts as must prevail  When riches birth and beauty's self will fail  And what he does to gain a vulgar end  Shall we neglect to make mankind our friend  Good sense and learning may esteem obtain  Humour and wit a laugh if rightly ta'en  Fair vertue admiration may impart  But 'tis good nature only wins the heart  It molds the body to an easy grace  And brightens every feature of the face  It smooths th' unpolish'd tongue with eloquence  And adds persuasion to the finest sense  Yet this like every disposition has  Fixt bounds o'er which it never ought to pass  When stretch'd too far its honour dies away  Its merit sinks and all its charms decay  Among the good it meets with no applause  And to its ruin the malicious draws  A slave to all who force it or entice  It falls by chance in vertue or in vice  'Tis true in pity for the poor it bleeds  It cloaths the naked and the hungry feeds  It chears the stranger nay its foe defends  But then as oft it injures its best friends  Study with care politeness that must teach  The modish forms of gesture and of speech  In vain formality with matron mien  And pertness apes her with familiar grin  They against nature for applauses stra  n  Distort themselves and give all others pain  She moves with easy tho' with measur'd pace  And shews no part of study but the grace  Yet ev'n by this man is but half refin'd  Unless philosophy subdues the mind  'Tis but a varnish that is quickly lost  Whene'er the soul in passion's sea is tost  Wou'd you both please and be instructed too  Watch well the rage of shining to subdue  Hear every man upon his favourite theme  And ever be more knowing than you seem  The lowest genius will afford some light  Or give a hint that had escap'd your sight  Doubt till he thinks you on conviction yield  And with fit questions let each pause be fill'd  And the most knowing will with pleasure grant  You're rather much reserv'd than ignorant  The rays of wit gild wheresoe'er they strike  But are not therefore fit for all alike  They charm the lively but the grave offend  And raise a foe as often as a friend  Like the resistless beams of blazing light  That cheer the strong and pain the weakly sight  If a bright fancy therefore be your share  Let judgment watch it with a guardian's care  'Tis like a torrent apt to overflow  Unless by constant government kept low  And ne'er inefficacious passes by  But overturns or gladdens all that's nigh  Or else like trees when suffer'd wild to shoot  That put forth much but all unripen'd fruit  It turns to affectation and grimace  As like to wit as dullness is to grace  How hard soe'er it be to bridle wit  Yet mem'ry oft no less requires the bit  How many hurried by its force away  For ever in the land of gossips stray  Usurp the province of the nurse to lull  Without her privilege for being dull  Tales upon tales they raise ten stories high  Without regard to use or symmetry  So R till his destin'd space is fill'd  Heaps bricks on bricks and fancies 'tis to build  A story should to please at least seem true  Be a propos well told concise and new  And whensoe'er it deviates from these rules  The wise will sleep and leave applause to fools  But others more intolerable yet  The waggeries that they've said or heard repeat  Heavy by mem'ry made and what's the worst  At secondhand as often as at first  And can even patience hear without disdain  The maiming register of sense once slain  While the dull features big with archness strive  In vain the forc'd half smile to keep alive  Some know no joy like what a word can raise  Haul'd thro' a language's perplexing maze  Till on a mate that seems t' agree they light  Like man and wife that still are opposite  Not lawyers at the bar play more with sense  When brought to the last trope of eloquence  Than they on ev'ry subject great or small  At clubs or counsels at a church or ball  Then cry we rob them of their tribute due  Alas how can we laugh and pity too  While others to extremes as wild will run  And with sour face anatomize a pun  When the brisk glass to freedom does entice  And rigid wisdom is a kind of vice  But let not such grave fops your laughter spoil  Ne'er frown where sense may innocently smile  Cramp not your language into logick rules  To Rostrums leave the pedantry of schools  Nor let your learning always be discern'd  But choose to seem judicious more than learn'd  Quote seldom and then let it be at least  Some fact that's prov'd or thought that's well express'd  But lest disguis'd your eye it should escape  Know pedantry can put on e'ery shape  For when we deviate into terms of art  Unless constrain'd we act the pedant's part  Or if we're ever in the selfsame key  No matter of what kind the subject be  From laws of nations down to laws of dress  For statesmen have their cant and belles no less  As good hear By dictate on epistles  Or Brmn comment on the Graecian whistles  As old Obesus preach upon his belly  Or Phileunucha rant on Farinelli  Flirtilla read a lecture on a fan  Or Wd set forth the praise of KouliKan  But above all things raillery decline  Nature but few does for that task design  'Tis in the ablest hand a dang'rous tool  But never fails to wound the medling fool  For all must grant it needs no common art  To keep men patient when we make them smart  Not wit alone nor humour's self will do  Without good nature and much prudence too  To judge aright of persons place and time  For taste decrees what's low and what's sublime  And what might charm today or o'er a glass  Perhaps at court or next day wou'd not pass  Then leave to low buffoons by custom bred  And form'd by nature to be kick'd and fed  The vulgar and unenvied task to hit  All persons right or wrong with random wit  Our wise forefathers born in sober days  Resign'd to fools the tart and witty phrase  The motley coat gave warning for the jest  Excus'd the wound and sanctify'd the pest  But we from high to low all strive to sneer  Will all be wits and not the livery wear  Of all the qualities that help to raise  In men the universal voice of praise  Whether in pleasure or in use they end  There's none that can with modesty contend  'Tis a transparent veil that helps the sight  And lets us look on merit with delight  In others 'tis a kindly light that seems  To gild the worst defects with borrow'd beams  Yet 'tis but little that its form be caught  Unless its origin be first in thought  Else rebel nature will reveal the cheat  And the whole work of art at once defeat  Hold forth upon yourself on no pretence  Unless invited or in selfdefence  The praise you take altho' it be your due  Will be suspected if it come from you  For each man by experience taught can tell  How strong a flatterer does within him dwell  And if to selfcondemning you incline  In sober sadness and without design  For some will slily arrogate a vice  That from excess of virtue takes its rise  The world cries out why does he hither come  Let him do penance for his sins at home  No part of conduct asks for skill more nice  Tho' none more common than to give advice  Misers themselves in this will not be saving  Unless their knowledge makes it worth the having  And where's the wonder when we will obtrude  An useless gift it meets ingratitude  Shun then unask'd this arduous task to try  But if consulted use sincerity  Too sacred is the welfare of a friend  To give it up for any selfish end  But use one caution sist him o'er and o'er  To find if all be not resolv'd before  If such the case in spite of all his art  Some word will give the soundings of his heart  And why shou'd you a bootless freedom use  That serves him not and may his friendship lose  Yet still on truth bestow this mark of love  Ne'er to commend the thing you can't approve  Sincerity has such resistless charms  She oft the fiercest of our foes disarms  No art she knows in native whiteness dress'd  Her thoughts all pure and therefore all express'd  She takes from error its deformity  And without her all other vertues die  Bright source of goodness to my aid descend  Watch o'er my heart and all my words attend  If still thou deign to set thy foot below  Among a race quite polish'd into show  Oh save me from the jilt's dissembling part  Who grants to all all favours but her heart  Perverts the end of charming for the fame  To fawn her business to deceive her aim  She smiles on this man tips the wink on that  Gives one a squeeze another a kind pat  Now jogs a foot now whispers in an ear  Here slips a letter and there casts a leer  Till the kind thing the company throughout  Distributes all its pretty self about  While all are pleas'd and wretched soon or late  All but the wise who see and shun the bait  Yet if as complaisance requires to do  And rigid vertue sometimes will allow  You stretch the truth in favour of a friend  Be sure it ever aim at some good end  To cherish growing virtue vice to shame  And turn to noble views the love of fame  And not like fawning parasites unaw'd  By sense or truth be ev'ry passion's bawd  Be rarely warm in censure or in praise  Few men deserve our passion either ways  For half the world but floats 'twixt good and ill  As chance disposes objects these the will  'Tis but a seesaw game where virtue now  Mounts above vice and then sinks down as low  Besides the wise still hold it for a rule  To trust that judgment most that seems most cool  For all that rises to hyperbole  Proves that we err at least in the degree  But if your temper to extremes should lead  Always upon th' indulging side exceed  For tho' to blame most lend a willing ear  Yet hatred ever will attend on fear  And when a neighbour's dwelling blazes out  The world will think 'tis time to look about  Let not the curious from your bosom steal  Secrets where prudence ought to set her seal  Yet be so frank and plain that at one view  In other things each man may see you thro'  For if the mask of policy you wear  The honest hate you and the cunning fear  Wou'd you be well receiv'd wheree'er you go  Remember each man vanquish'd is a foe  Resist not therefore with your utmost might  But let the weakest think he's sometimes right  He for each triumph you shall thus decline  Shall give ten opportunities to shine  He sees since once you own'd him to excel  That 'tis his interest you shou'd reason well  And tho' when roughly us'd he's full of choler  As blustering By to a brother scholar  Yet by degrees inure him to submit  He's tame and in his mouth receives the bit  But chiefly against trifling contests guard  'Tis here submission seems to man most hard  Nor imitate that resolute old fool  Ctesipho    Who undertook to kick against his mule  But those who will not by instruction learn  How fatal trifles prove let story warn  Panthus and Euclio link'd by friendship's tie  Liv'd each for each as each for each wou'd die  Like objects pleas'd them and like objects pain'd  'Twas but one soul that in two bodies reign'd  One night as usual 'twas their nights to pass  They ply'd the cheerful but still temp'rate glass  When so a doubt is rais'd about a word  A doubt that must be ended by the sword  One falls a victim mark O man thy shame  Because their glossaries were not the same  Cou'd Baly's self more tenderness have shown  For his two tomes of words tho' half his own  For what remains of failings without end  Morals must some and some the laws must mend  While others in such monstrous forms appear  As tonguety'd sourness sly suspicion's leer  Freefisted rudeness dropsical pretence  Proteus' caprice and elbowing insolence  No caution to avoid them they demand  Like wretches branded by the hangman's hand  If faith to some philosophers be given  Man that great lord of earth that heir of heav'n  Savage at first inhabited the wood  And scrambled with his fellowbrutes for food  No social home he knew no friendship's tie  Selfish in good in ill without ally  Till some in length of time of stronger nerve  And greater cunning forc'd the rest to serve  One common purpose and in nature's spite  Brought the whole jarring species to unite  But might we not with equal reason say  That ev'ry single particle of clay  Which forms our body was at first design'd  To lie for ever from the rest disjoin'd  Can this be said and can it be allow'd  'Twas with its powers for no one end endow'd  If so we own that man at first by art  Was sooth'd to act in social life a part  'Tis true in some the seeds of discord seem  To contradict this alluniting scheme  But that no more hurts nature's general course  Than matter found with a repelling force  Turn we awhile on lonely man our eyes  And see what frantick scenes of folly rise  In some dark monastery's gloomy cells  Where formal selfpresuming vertue dwells  Bedoz'd with dreams of gracedistilling caves  Of holy puddles unconsuming graves  Of animated plaister wood and stone  And mighty cures by sainted sinners done  Permit me muse still farther to explore  And turn the leaves of superstition o'er  Where wonders upon wonders ever grow  Chaos of zeal and blindness mirth and woe  St Dominick vide Jansenius Nic  Visions of devils into monkeys turn'd  That hot from hell roar at a finger burn'd  Of our Saviour and others vide Ferrand  Bottles of precious tears that saints have wept  Of Joseph vide Molinaem  And breath a thousand years in phials kept  St Cathro's vide Colganum  Sunbeams sent down to prop one friar's staff  St Anthony  And hell broke loose to make another laugh  Vide life of St Colman by Colganus  Obedient fleas and  The same life by the same author  superstitious mice  Vide speculum vitae sancti Francisci

 Letters and houses by an angel carried  Maria de la visitation vide her life by Lusignam  And wondrous virgin nuns to JESUS married  One monk not knowing how to spend his time  Sits down to find out some unheard of crime  Increases the large catalogue of sins  And where the sober finish there begins  Of death eternal his decree is past  For the first crime as fix'd as for the last  While that as idle and as pious too  Compounds with false religion for the true  He courtly usher to the blest abodes  Weighs all the niceties of forms and modes  And makes the rugged paths so smooth and even  None but an illbred man can miss of heav'n  One heav'ninspir'd invents a frock or hood  The taylor now cuts out and men grow good  Another quits his stockings breeches shirt  Because he fancies vertue dwells with dirt  While all concur to take away the stress  From weightier points and lay it on the less  Anxious each paltry relique to preserve  Of him whose hungry friends they leave to starve  Harrass'd by watchings abstinence and chains  Stranger to joys familiar grown with pains  To all the means of virtue they attend  With strictest care and only miss the end  Can scripture teach us or can sense persuade  That man for such employments e'er was made  Far be that thought but let us now relate  A character as opposite as great  In him who living gave to Athens fame  And by his death immortaliz'd her shame  Great scourge of sophists he from heav'n brought down  And plac'd true wisdom on th' usurper's throne  Philosopher in all things but pretence  He taught what they neglected common sense  They o'er the stiff Lyceum form'd to rule  He o'er mankind all Athens was his school  The sober tradesman and smart petitmaitre  Great lords and wits in their own eyes still greater  With him grew wise unknowing they were taught  He spoke like them tho' not like them he thought  Nor wept nor laugh'd at man's perverted state  But left to women this to ideots that  View him with sophists fam'd for fierce contest  Or crown'd with roses at the jovial feast  Insulted by a peevish noisy wife  Or at the bar foredom'd to lose his life  What moving words flow from his artless tongue  Sublime with ease with condescension strong  Yet scorn'd to flatter vice or virtue blame  Nor chang'd to please but pleas'd because the same  The same by friends caress'd by foes withstood  Still unaffected cheerful mild and good  Behold one pagan drawn in colours faint  Outshine ten thousand monks tho' each a saint  Here let us fix our foot hence take our view  And learn to try false merit by the true  We see when reason stagnates in the brain  The dregs of fancy cloud its purest vein  But circulation betwixt mind and mind  Extends its course and renders it refin'd  When warm with youth we tread the flow'ry way  All nature charms and ev'ry scene looks gay  Each object gratifies each sense in turn  Whilst now for rattles now for nymphs we burn  Enslav'd by friendship's or by love's soft smile  We ne'er suspect because we mean no guile  Till flush'd with hope from views of past success  We lay on some main trifle all our stress  When lo the mistress or the friend betrays  And the whole fancied cheat of life displays  Stunn'd with an ill that from ourselves arose  For instinct rul'd when reason should have chose  We fly for comfort to some lonely scene  Victims henceforth of dirt and drink and spleen  But let no obstacles that cross our views  Pervert our talents from their destin'd use  For as upon life's hill we upwards press  Our views will be obstructed less and less  Be all false delicacy far away  Lest it from nature lead us quite astray  And for th' imagin'd vice of human race  Destroy our vertue or our parts debase  Since God with reason joins to make us own

whose powerful smiles alone  Command obedience and secure the throne  Contending parties and Plebeian rage  Had puzzled Loyalty for half an age  Conqu'ring our hearts you end the long dispute  All who have eyes confess you absolute  To Tory doctrines even Whigs resign  And in your person own the right divine  Thus sung the muse in her last moments fir'd  With CAROLINA's Praise and then expir'd  ADVICE to a Lady in AUTUMN  ASSES milk half a pint take at seven or before  Then sleep for an hour or two and no more  At nine stretch your arms and oh think when alone  There's no pleasure in bedMARY bring me my gown  Slip on that ere you rise let your caution be such  Keep all cold from your breast there's already too much  Your pinners set right your twitcher ty'd on  Your prayers at an end and your breakfast quite done  Retire to some author improving and gay  And with sense like your own set your mind for the day  At twelve you may walk for at this time o'the year  The sun like your wit is as mild as 'tis clear  But mark in the meadows the ruin of time  Take the hint and let life be improv'd in its prime  Return not in haste nor of dressing take heed  For beauty like yours no assistance can need  With an appetite thus down to dinner you sit  Where the chief of the feast is the flow of your wit  Let this be indulg'd and let laughter go round  As it pleases your mind to your health 'twill redound  After dinner two glasses at least I approve  Name the first to the king and the last to your love  Thus cheerful with wisdom with innocence gay  And calm with your joys gently glide thro' the day  The dews of the evening most carefully shun  Those tears of the sky for the loss of the sun  Then in chat or at play with a dance or a song  Let the night like the day pass with pleasure along  All cares but of love banish far from your mind  And those you may end when you please to be kind  On a Lady's drinking the BathWaters  THE gushing streams impetuous flow  In haste to DELIA's lips to go  With equal haste and equal heat  Who would not rush those lips to meet  Bless'd envy'd streams still greater bliss  Attends your warm and liquid kiss  For from her lips your welcome tide  Shall down her heaving bosom glide  There fill each swelling globe of love  And touch that heart I ne'er could move  From thence in soft meanders stray  And find at last the blissful way  Which thought may paint tho' verse mayn't say  Too happy rival dwell not there  To rack my heart with jealous care  But quit the blest abode tho' loth  And quickly passing ease us both  VERSES written in a LADY's SHERLOCK upon Death  MIstaken fair lay Sherlock by  His doctrine is deceiving  For whilst he teaches us to die  He cheats us of our living  To die's a lesson we shall know  Too soon without a master  Then let us only study now  How we may live the faster  To live's to love to bless be blest  With mutual inclination  Share then my ardour in your breast  And kindly meet my passion  But if thus bless'd I may not live  And pity you deny  To me at least your Sherlock give  'Tis I must learn to die  SONG  WHEN Fanny blooming fair  First caught my ravish'd sight  Struck with her shape and air  I felt a strange delight  Whilst eagerly I gaz'd  Admiring ev'ry part  And ev'ry feature prais'd  She stole into my heart  In her bewitching eyes  Ten thousand loves appear  There Cupid basking lies  His shafts are hoarded there  Her blooming cheeks are dy'd  With colour all their own  Excelling far the pride  Of roses newly blown  Her wellturn'd limbs confess  The lucky hand of Jove  Her features all express  The beauteous queen of love  What flames my nerves invade  When I behold the breast  Of that too charming maid  Rise suing to be press'd  Venus round Fanny's waist  Has her own Cestus bound  With guardian Cupids grac'd  Who dance the circle round  How happy must he be  Who shall her zone unloose  That bliss to all but me  May heaven and she refuse  SONG  WHenever Chloe I begin  Your heart like mine to move  You tell me of the crying sin  Of unchaste lawless love  How can that passion be a sin  Which gave to Chloe birth  How can those joys but be divine  Which make a heaven on earth  To wed mankind the priests trepann'd  By some sly fallacy  And disobey'd God's great command  Increase and multiply  You say that love's a crime content  Yet this allow you must  More joy's in heav'n if one repent  Than over ninety just  Sin then dear girl for heaven's sake  Repent and be forgiven  Bless me and by repentance make  A holy day in heav'n  INDEX to the First
