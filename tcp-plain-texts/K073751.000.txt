OPTIMUS  Lowth Praelecti      Ex Solonis Elegiis  BY WILLIAM HAYLEY ESQ  DUBLIN Printed by P BYRNE No COLLEGEGREEN opposite the Statue of King William  M DCC LXXXIII  ELEGY  MOURN Son of Amos mourn in accent sharp  Of angry sorrow strike thy heav'nly harp  Mourn thou sublimest of the sainted choir  Those lips that touch'd with thy coelestial fire  Clear'd from the gather'd clouds of many an age  The bright'ning flame of thy prophetic rage  Those lips thro' Learning's sacred sphere renown'd  Have stain'd their▪glory by a servile sound  Envy with ranc'rous joy these accents heard  And dwells with triumph on the fatal word  Waging against Renown eternal wars  Thus she insults the merit she abhors  See Isaiah chap xiv  "How has the radiance of the mitre ceas'd  "Oblivion's poppy shades the prostrate priest  "In dark servility's expanding cave  "Forgotten prelates hail thee from the grave  "O Lucifer of prophecy the star  "Rolling through Hebrew clouds thy radiant car  "Art thou too fall'n as we Can Flatt'ry's tide  "Drown thy free spirit and thy Attic pride  "Is this the man who spoke in language strong  "The praise of Liberty's Athenian song  "Blest are her notes but curst the sordid things  "That priestcraft offers to the pride of Kings  "For never never shall fair Freedom's hand  "Enroll one prelate in her sacred band"  Peace Envy peace nor deem with bigot rage  Long labours cancell'd by a hasty page  Nor if a word unweigh'd her lips escape  Paint injur'd Virtue in Corruption's shape  Shall sland'rous Prejudice with gen'ral blame  Plunge ranks unsifted in the gulph of Shame  If some be servile shall we madly rave  That ev'ry churchman is in soul a slave  Abhorr'd idea fraught with basest guile  Turn to the splendid annals of our isle  See mitred Langton lead the patriot van  And bear O Liberty thy sacred plan  Though lust of vengeance regal pride inflame  To brand his virtue with Rebellion's name  Still in the tented field from fear exempt  No menace shakes him and no offers tempt  Till England sav'd from tyrannous control  Owes her bright charter to his guardian soul  Let Freedom's eye our later story search  Her modern champion issues from the church  See Hoadley's persevering zeal withdraw  The veil of bigotry from heav'nly law  With decent truth expound with reason scan  God's gracious edict and the rights of man  To shield the dearest gift of Nature's hand  Was thine pure spirit and thy name shall stand  Engrav'd on Liberty's eternal rock  With ardent Sidney with the milder Locke  And guarded by the Muse of Glory shine  In manly Akenside's immortal line  But these examples rise from hallow'd earth  The church has models still of living worth  Though some grave bishops fond of dull repose  Without a dream of Learning's friends or foes  Enjoy their table or from thence withdrawn  Sink in soft slumber on their sleeves of lawn  Though one fierce pedant proud of ancient rule  Rashly mistook a senate for a school  Till angry nobles bid his fury cease  And lash'd the fiery pedagogue to peace  We boast a Shipley who with taste refin'd  Enjoys that richest treasure wealth of mind  Intent to pen in Leisure's learned hour  His just Philippic on oppressive pow'r  Or teach thy flow'rs Simplicity to bloom  With Attic sweetness o'er an English tomb  Nor you with honour can we fail to name  Law gen'rous guardian of that sage's name  See the preface to the new edition of Locke by the Bishop of Carlisle  Who made mild government with faith agree  And "stripp'd intolerance of every plea"  Nor dignity corrupts nor time subdues  Your spirit glowing with the noblest views  While your keen eyes undimm'd by age explore  The utmost depths of metaphysic lore  Still guard his fame whose genius you enjoy  And the dark sophist's baleful web destroy  That seeks to shroud with subtle falsehood spun  The praise of Freedom's scientific Son  O Lowth we saw thy radiant name on high  Amid the the purest lights of Learning's sky  And long if true to Freedom's guiding voice  Long in thy splendor shall that sphere rejoice  One passing vapour shall dissolve away  And leave thy glory's unobstructed ray  But while on Fame's high precipice you stand  Be nobly firm nor bend the virtuous hand  Fill'd with rich sweets from Freedom's flow'ry mead  To pluck Servility's oblivious weed  High in the Court's rank soil that creeper winds  And oft with dark embrace the Crosier binds  While squeez'd from thence the subtle prelate flings  Its luscious poison in the ear of Kings  Nor spread in courts alone these noxious leaves  My Lord as largely as he pays receives  And supple chaplains to a prelate bring  A dose as rich as what he gives a King  Such sycophants could such to thee belong  Might vent their venom on this friendly song  "Shame on the wretch these flatt'rers would exclaim  "Who dares one accent of your voice to blame  "But fearing with your foes his name to blend  "Yet more abusive calls himself your friend  No let that radiant Truth whose pow'r supreme  Rewards her genuine bard with Glory's beam  Search my free spirit and pronounce it clear  From meanness spleen malignity or fear  To ardent friendship I my numbers owe  Whate'er their failings from that source they flow  If weak yet honest if presumptuous true  Thy worth the motive and thy fame the view  The man whose writings pure delight dispense  Enchant my fancy or enlarge my sense  Whose heav'nly wisdom mending human faults  Warms my chill'd virtue and my soul exalts  Friend of my bosom I this man declare  And in my inmostheart the treasure wear  Bishop or clerk his fortune bright or blank  Rever'd as noble whatsoe'er his rank  His praise I echo with a fond acclaim  Joy in his health and triumph in his fame  With pure attachment and with joy refin'd  I boast such friendship with thy letter'd mind  Whene'er with deep delight and new regard  We search thy comments on each Hebrew bard  Where thy bold precepts to young minds impart  The end and value of the poet's art  Its pow'rs ennobled by applause like thine  Yet more we idolize that art divine  Vivas hic virtutis voces audimus vivam effigiem cernimus  Lowth de Poeticae fine et utilitate  In that fair Virtue's living voice we hear  In that behold her living form appear  With joy the justice of your wrath we own  When your mild spirit takes a sharper tone  When touch'd by Warburton's vindictive gall  It fires at Freedom's controversial call  From wounded Genius flows your splendid line  As from the trodden grape the sparkling wine  Your hand like Israel's unanointed King  Launching the pebble from his certain sling  Strikes to the dust Presumption's mighty boast  The proud Goliah of her critic host  Thus robe'd in honour of the richest dye  And view'd by Freedom with a parent's eye  From thee that goddess with amazement hears  One note that sounds discordant in her ears  Wild sparkles flash from her astonish'd eyes  O save my falt'ring son she fondly cries  Call his past glories to his sharpen'd sight  And let him learn from their collected light  My flow'rs immortal  ear no winter's frown  While lost in darkness Adulation's down  Flies like the gossamer that whirlwinds bear  In sport contemptuous through the waste of air  Tell him though bright the smile of Kings may seem  There shines a jewel of a brighter beam  Above that smile all human wealth above  'Tis worn by Keppel in his country's love  Shall Lowth adapt no more his Attic style  To the meridian of my fav'rite isle  But feebly speak in France's languid tone  Faint as beneath Oppression's burning zone  Or blazing only with a bigot's fire  Awake the slumb'ring flames of regal ire  Stretch the statetheorist on Priesthood's rack  And from the pulpit  See the late sermon by the Bishop of London and his note on Dr Price  aim the personal attack  Far other precepts suit the hallow'd sage  Who aims to purify this venal age  With juster wrath our mitred Lords declaim  On man's adult'rous guilt and woman's shame  Yes lovely woman Fashion's wayward spleen  Has idly plung'd like Aegypt's giddy queen  Thy purity that pearl of richest price  In the deep chalice of dissolving Vice  Though thy unblushing frailties scorn excuse  Let Pity still her palliatives produce  Confirm'd by ages let this truth be known  This is particularly proved by the celebrated chastity of the Roman ladies in the early days of the republic and yet more by that of our Gothic ancestors in the purest ages of Chivalry  See Stuart's admirable View of Society in Europe▪  Thy Honour's guardian first forgets his own  While man holds Freedom as the noblest wealth  Pride of his heart and of his days the health  With native charms his fair companion's grac'd  If plain yet lovely and if simple chaste  Endearing age succeeds to rapt'rous youth  Her life is virtue and her love is truth  But when her guard in Luxury's venal hour  Yields his chaste soul a prostitute to Pow'r  Heav'n in just vengeance on the abject slave  Corrupts the purest gift its bounty gave  The tree of Comfort bears the thorn of Strife  And poison'd marriage grows the pest of life  Ills after ills in dire succession flow  And private misery mounts to public woe  O Lowth whose voice by purest Learning taught  To speak the language of exalted thought  May best encounter Vice's murky crew  And Faith and Virtue's fainting pow'rs renew  Still by sage efforts of a soul sublime  Correct the rank abuses of the time  Rememb'ring still with Wisdom's just regard    Ex Solonis Elegiis▪  Thy fav'rite maxim of the Attic bard  "As from the clouds bursts forth the weight of snow  "Lightnings or hail that blast the scene below  "So bursts the ruin of a sinking State  "From the dark vices of the guilty grate"  In this blest isle and shining only here  Astraea safe in Freedom's guardian spear  With native boldness in her balance flings  The weak the mighty Ministers and Kings  And Piety's blind zeal would curse the land  If it could force this balance from her hand  Rise then O rise with Hoadley's spirit fir'd  But in thy richer eloquence attir'd  Teach us to guard from ev'ry mean control  That manly vigour of the judging soul  Which Faith approves which Loyalty allows  Teach us while Honour to thy doctrine bows  That Duty's praise in no blind worship lies  But Reason's homage to the just and wise  So to thy Country to thy God endear'd  By Heav'n protected as on earth rever'd  May thy mild age in purest fame rejoice  In fame where Envy hears no jarring voice  So may Religion with divine relief  Drop her rich balm on thy parental grief  May that sweet comforter the heav'nly Muse  Who fondly treasures Sorrow's sacred dews  In Glory's vase preserve the precious tear  Shed by paternal Love on Beauty's bier  And O when thou to Learning's deep regret  Must pay at Nature's call our common debt  While life's last murmurs shake the parching throat  And Pity catches that portentous note  While in its hollow orb the rolling eye  Of Hope is turn'd convulsive to the sky  May holiest visitants each sainted seer  Whose well known accents warble in thine ear  Descend with Mercy's delegated pow'r  To soothe the anguish of that awful hour  With lenient aid release thy struggling breath  Guide thy freed spirit through the gates of Death  Shew thee emerging from this earthly storm  Thy lov'd Maria in a seraph's form  And give thee gazing on the Throne of Grace  This bold expression of exalted piety was borrowed from St Paul by the great Condè the sublime and enviable circumstances of whose death are thus described by the eloquent Bossuet  Oui dit il nous verrons Dieu comme il est face à face il repetoit en Latin avec un gout merveilleux ces grands mots Sicuti est facie ad faciem et on ne se lassoit point de le voir dans ce doux transport  Oraison Funebre le Louis de Bourbon  To view thy mighty Maker face to face  THE END
