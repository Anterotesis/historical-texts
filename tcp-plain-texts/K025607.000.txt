 KILKENNY OR THE OLD MAN'S WISH  By W R CHETWOOD  Tho' Rough the Lines they speak the Heart  Therefore excuse the want of Art  DUBLIN Printed for the AUTHOR And Sold by G FAULKNER in  Essex Street  G and A EWING and P WILSON in  Damestreet  and J ESDALL on  Corkhill    KILKENNY OR THE Old Man's WISH  SINCE Man is surely Born to Die  And Rise to long Eternity  Let Virtue guide his steps below  That fearless he may meet the Blow  AS I am one of Human Race  With Patience waiting heavenly Grace  And Age has worn me fifty Years  With tardy Hopes and Swiftwing'd Fears  I'd Wish the Lees of Life to wear  Without the weight of Wordly care  HAD I my  Wish  or  choice  to Dwell  It should 'be some clean rural Cell  Beneath the Shade of spreading Trees  Whose murm'rings with a gentle Breeze  Might Lull my Senses into Rest  And sooth the Troubles of my Breast  O  Dunmore  seat of earthly Bliss  Where  Pan  and  Echo  sweetly Kiss  Pan  the God of Groves Woods Mountains and Shepherds was beloved by  Echo    Whose lofty Woods and Sylvan Scenes  Thy Dells and Varigated Greens  Seem to surpass old  Tempe  's Grove  Tempe  the most delightful Situation in  Thessaly  a Vale surrounded with Woods Groves Rivers  c  That seat of joy and springing Love  Within thy Shade i'd fix my Cell  There's none on Earth wou'd please so well  Through the vast Globe I've wander'd o'er  And touch'd at many a distant Shore  Seen various Nations  Rude  and  Mild    Nature improv'd and nature  Wild  Yet none have such Contentment given  As thou  Dunmore  an earthly Heav'n  Yet when I view thy mould'ring Walls  Whose trembling Ruin daily Falls  I must Lament thy Ancient Date  With him that urg'd his luckless Fate  A LITTLE Garden form'd for Food  Selfcultur'd to enlive my Blood  IF Lab'ring in my Garden's bound  Along hid Treasure shou'd be found  For Ages bury'd under Ground  In during Marble wou'd I raise  To you great  Mr  Collis  the Inventor of the Marble Mills near  Kilkenny    COLLIS endless Praise  With Artful chissel should be shown  In Bust a Figure like thy own  O great Inventor Native Son  No Art can equal what thou'st done  HIBERNIA may with Pride declare  Nought under Heav'n is found so Rare  MY Garden Borders set with Flowers  Bedew'd with artificial Showers  Shou'd Nature heated cease to deign  Her Friendly Clouds and dropping Rain  There wou'd I scent the Damask Rose  That in my vernal border grows  And as it's sweetness meets Decay  I shou'd Reflect and sighing say  Thus Life blooms up and Fades away  BENEATH my little Garden Wall  A purling Stream shou'd gently fall  Whose limpid murmurings might glide  Unmix'd with any lustful Tide  To violate her virtuous Bed  And swell her Womb with riseing dread  Then leave her Stain'd to Weep and Mourn  With various Mischiefs not her own  As many a Wretch has Woman done  O lovely Sex your Virtue keep  Let no ill Thoughts disturb your Sleep  Take sage Advice from him that knows  The strength and Number of your Foes  All sullied Arts and Sighs despise  Repell the Darts of guilty Eyes  The glitt'ring Gem the Orient yields  The Flow'rs that deck the Fragrant Fields  The Silks inrich'd with burnish'd Gold  For these poor Beauty oft is sold  All these true Virtue will outshine  For Virtue's Robe is all Divine  RAIS'D o'er the Brook an evergreen  The Vine and Woodbine mixt between  Whose tendrils shou'd conjointly move  To form a Sphaeral Arch above  There woul'd I sit to breath fresh Air  And view the glorious Hemisphere  With Contemplation fill my Soul  Admire the Beauty of the whole  Then Praise the great Almighty Hand  Who form'd the World at his Command  What Reptile Heart all these cou'd see  And yet that Wretch an  Atheist  be  SEE from this height the  Castle  rise  Whose Turrets seem to brave the Skies  Behold those Domes for Heav'n design'd  To cure the Passions of the Mind  There mixing with the early Guest  I'd Pray to gain eternal Rest  Forgive as I wou'd be Forgiven  And live in Hope to merit Heav'n  HOW I regret the want of Art  To show the ardours of my Heart  Had I great  A Phillips  Esq  Phillip  's honest skill  Who in sweet Honey dip'd his Quill  Whose welltaught Numbers gently fall  Not like lost  Pope  who wrote in Gall  Drawcansir  like at every blow  He struck at ALL both  Friend  and  Foe    O awful  Phillips  cou'd I be  By Inspiration Fir'd by thee  How smooth my rugged Lines would flow  With pleasing Raptures as they go  A gentle generous Flame impart  To warm the Thought and touch the Heart  MY Habit plain devoid of Lace  That Suits not an  Autumnal  Face  A coarse dark  Frize  may fit my Age  That might the Northern blasts asswage  WHEN Winters Snow and petrid Hail  Deform the riseing Hill and Dale  And hoary Frosts disguise the Woods  And bind in Chains the rapid Floods  Within my Cell I wou'd Retire  And warm me with  Kilkenny  Fire  A few well chosen Books I'd have  Some to prepare me for the Grave  The rest to pass my time away  Heav'n asks not all my Hours to pray  Religion  ought to cheer the mind  Form us Benevolent and kind  No scowling looks or sour grimace  Shou'd ere be seated on the Face  But all diffus'd with smilling Grace  SOME Friends select like  Books  I'd chuse  For converse fit or scan the  Muse  To read a  Play  I think no crime  Or any other  decent  Rhyme  Yet shun all those whom  Vice  approve  Or give Success to  Lawless  Love  Wou'd  Helsham  deign to condescend  Arthur Helsham  Esq  Recorder of  Kilkenny  To rank me as his meanest Friend  Or  Evans  thou just Magistrate  Alderman  Evans  chose Mayor of the City two succeeding Years for his Justice and Integrity  Whose double Honours speak thee Great  The feather'd Hours wou'd smiling pass  Altho' we chac'd the circ'ling Glass  Good Wine with moderation us'd  Revives the Sense but drowns abus'd  IF I shou'd hear the early Horn  With sprightly Notes awake the Morn  Expelling Slumber from the Eyes  Bidding the lazy Sluggard Rise  To mount the fiery mettled Steed  Who champs and foaming to be Freed  With guided Rein to scour the mead  Or ore the breathing Mountain lead  My Blood wou'd rouze me from my Cell  To view the Sport I lov'd so well  Yet take Discretion for my Guide  And  Walk  such Hills I us'd to Ride  Then when the pleasing Toil was o're  And Hounds and Horns were heard no more  I'd to my quiet Cell repair  And Healthfull feed on homely Fare  High Sauces but corrupt the Blood  Diffusing Poison with our Food  A little Nature will suffice  An  Epicure  was never Wise  WHEN Spring revives the flowry Field  And calls the Feather'd Race to build  When they begin to strain their Throats  With various and delightful Notes  I shou'd not judge it any Crime  To call back years of fletting time  And tho those Days are long since past  For pleasing Moments fly in Haste  Yet I may think upon the Fair  Whose lovely Eyes dispel'd dispair  But then to lose a virtuous Wife  That joy dispenser of my Life  That social Balm to ev'ry Smart  That Cordial to an aching Heart  He that can feel by Simphathy  Must lose his Wife and love like me  For Love in Age to Friendship turns  And with a lasting ardour Burns  Hale Youth perhaps may smilling seem  To taunt and Ridicule this Theme  But youngsters I would have you know  I once was young as well as you  True Love was never thought a Crime  A pleasing Joy a Bliss Sublime  A beauteous Infant ever mild  A Transporttouching tender Child  When his chast Bow and thrilling Dart  Fixes his Empire in the Heart  But then this lovely beauteous youth  This Child of Innocence and Truth  A  Brother  has so like in Face  Adorn'd with all his smiling Grace  The first inspiring  heavenly  Love  The last to  guilty  Passions move  Infects the Blood within the Veins  And tortures with Infernal Pains  O shun his lewd detested Art  You'll know him by his  leaden  Dart  WHEN  Phoebus  with enliv'ning Ray  Improves the Glebe and lengthens Day  Then to the Silver stream repair  Breathing the wholesome Morning Air  And e're  Aurora  shews her Face  Prepare to Trap the finny Race  Great Nature there we may behold  Some ting'd with  Azure  some with  Gold    Some arm'd with Scales prepar'd for War  The Innocent for Flight prepare  So  Butchers  if a  Butcher  's nigh  When  harmless  Curs are passing by  Hallo their Dogs to set them on  And  laugh  to see them piecemeal torn  Thus in the Stream the weakones fall  But wily Man betrays them all  THOU  Dunmore Cave  I wou'd once more  Dunmore  Cave in the Park  But not alone thy Womb explore  Where Nature Playfull has design'd  Such Works as will surprize Mankind  Ill omen'd Birds the Mouth Resort  The Dwellers of this dreary Court  Descending then by slow degrees  Your Hands sustain'd by hanging Trees  The Vault enlarges to your sight  Displays to view a gloomy Light  There as in new found Worlds you see  Great Nature's vast variety  Where dropping Waters change to Stone  To form the  Cylinder  and  Cone    There concav'd  Organs  Pillars rise  And  Tubes  that might deceive the Eyes  But stay not long for all beneath  Is noxious Air the Vitals breath  The Caverns ending none can tell  Old Fables say there  Witches  dwell  And this the ready Road to Hell  Miles have been trac'd the gloomy Way  Without the sight of chearing Day  Yet all the surface over head  Is fertile Land and grassgrown Mead  Where Cattle graze and Nightly Sleep  And  Shepherd's  keep their harmless Sheep  To watch their Lambs to give Relief  Or Guard them from the prouling Thief  The  Wolves  whom oft their Flocks annoy'd  Long Ages past have been destroy'd  But Monsters of the  Human  Race  Now  Wolves  are gone usurp their place  BEHOLD where shallow  Dinan  flows  Dinan  a turbulant shallow River that crosses the Park  Noisy as  Fops  or empty  Beaux    Till quite absorb'd within the  Nore    The  Nore  the  Barrow  and the  Sure  are called the three Sisters they all meet near  Waterford  and join the Sea  Is silent curb'd beneath her Shore  See how the noble Sister glides  With lovely Borders on her Sides  To meet the other Royal Pair  As full as Beautifull and Fair  Hibernia  's Sisters Graces three  They Kiss embrace then meet the Sea  THUS wou'd I pass my Days and Nights  In Social innocent Delights  WHAT Hope alas have I to find  Such sweet contentment for my Mind  A Dream of transient Bliss too Great  O teach me Heav'n to bear my Fate  I've learnt too late in Sorrows School  The easy Man's the  Villians  Tool  Tho'  Britain  is my Mother Earth  She prov'd a  Stepdame  from my Birth  Therefore if I my Wishes have  This muchlov'd Soil shall be my Grave  O BLEST IERNE happy Isle  Around thee Heav'n and Nature Smile  No  Murrain  o'er thy Cattle Reigns  Nor Wardrawnblood imbrue thy Plains  Replete with Plenty Health and ease  In War enjoying sweetey'd Peace  Beholding Arts that smilling Rise  O MADDEN justly  good  and Wise  Thou art the Source from whence they flow  From thee next Heav'n they Spring and grow  One  Monarch  may his People gain  Succeeding Kings with Blessings Reign  Yet these when Death's cold slumbers call  Are lost and in Oblivion Fall  But MADDEN endless Praise will find  Rever'd by long unborn Mankind  HERE Harmony has chose her Seat  Within this Halcion safe Retreat  Here  Mathew  's flying Fingers roul  To calm and thrill the raptur'd Soul  Immortal Music form'd the World  That lay in dreary Chaos hurld  The  Sphaeres  began their heav'nly Strains  To range the Vocal Hills and Plains  All order came by sweet

Hail Social Virtue gift Divine  How heav'nly bright your Actions shine  Your Souls unitedly agree  To give the wretched Liberty  AGAIN I must pursue my Theme  This Airy Hopeless empty Dream  IF Neigh'bring Peasants round my Cell  Shou'd not in seemly concord dwell  I'd try to Heal their homebred Wars  And with good councel Cure their Jars  WHEN e're the Rural Nymphs and Swains  Prepare their Sports upon the Plains  I'd mix and leaning on my Staff  Partake their Joy and join their Laugh  Old Age with youth might well agree  Wou'd they shake off Severity  The  Harp  harmoniously be strung  If Age wou'd think they once were young  BUT if my End with Giant' strides  Comes roleing with impetuous Tides  And all the Lumber of Disease  Which  Death  alone can only ease  Grant Heav'n with Patience I may bear  The destin'd load of sickly care  And when pale Death's unerring Dart  The Fate of King's has pierc'd my Heart  'Tis this and all I wou'd have said  Alas the good old Man is DEAD
