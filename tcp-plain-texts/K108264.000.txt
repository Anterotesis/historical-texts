ANSWER TO Dr WMS'S Critical Dissertation on the same As approved and  republished  by THE AUTHORS OF THE CRITICAL REVIEW  REMARKS ON THE Thirteenth Fourteenth Fifteenth and Six∣teenth Verses of the Seventh Chapter of ISAIAH c  Hear ye now O house of David is it a small thing for you to weary men but will ye weary my God also Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Immanuel Butter and honey shall he eat that he may know to refuse the evil and choose the good For before the child shall know to refuse the evil and choose the good the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kings  THIS text has in all ages of Christianity been esteemed a clear and certain predic∣tion of the miraculous birth of Christ and therefore these remarks upon it would have been superfluous had not a learned and ingenious gentleman lately attempted to prove a contrary  doctrine  See Critical Dissertation on Isaiah vii  viz  That the prophet  in this text  had no reference to the Messiah  Page    That  the words of Isaiah prove only that a young woman should conceive and bring forth a son without in∣timating any thing miraculous in her conception  c  P  That  from the most careful and impartial examination the word  here translated a virgin  doth not appear to signify strictly a virgin  but that  it seems to mean a young woman in gene∣ral without specifying particularly whether she is a virgin or not  P    This writer is not singular in his notions for the authors of the Critical Review have publicly pro∣fessed themselves of the same opinion concerning this prophecy see N  o  fo  The most obvious and natural explication  say they  is this which Dr Wms  The author of a Concordance to the Greek Testament  has adopted  c  I do not find that they have objected to a single part of the Doctor's work and therefore this pub∣lic declaration certainly makes them parties to the whole nay perhaps I may say with justice that they are more concerned in publishing these notions to the world even than the  anonymous author  him∣self for instead of giving a short extracted ac∣count  of the work as usual they seem to have co∣pied the whole almost at length scarcely omitting a single circumstance  Now I must acknowledge in justice to Dr Wms that I think he has set forth his hypo∣thesis to all the advantage that it is capable of nevertheless he does not make it appear that the word  in any other place of the Old Testa∣ment where it occurs must  necessarily  signify a young woman that was  not  a virgin without which proof the common acceptation of the sign pro∣mised by Isaiah cannot with justice be rejected especially as a virgin did afterwards conceive and bear a son a miracle which never happened before or since the birth of Christ therefore it was cer∣tainly a sign worthy of that great and wonderful event and from that time to this has by all Christians except the author of the Critical Disser∣tation and the authors of the Critical Review  Dr Wms has since informed me of  one other wri∣ter  of the same opinion concerning this passage viz the author of  "The Assembly's Confession of Faith examined"  printed in but at the same time he acknowledges that this authority was not known even to himself until  "several months after the Dissertation was published"  and he declares concerning his own sentiments of the passage that he apprehended them  "altogether new"  when he wrote  for  says he  I did not then know that any Chris∣tian writer had so explained it    been esteemed the completion of the said pro∣phecy  Dr Wms observes that the word  occurs only seven times in all and therefore I hope it will not take up too much of my readers time if I attempt to examine the context of these several places in order to ascertain the true sense of the word  The text wherein the signification of this word is esteemed the most doubtful is in Prov xxx where Solomon mentions four things that were too hard for him in which number according to the English translation he includes  the way of a man with a maid  The sense of this passage is very different according to the Syriac version wherein  is rendered  in his youth  viz the way of a man  "in his youth"  and not  "with a maid"  as in the English version Like∣wise the Latin vulgate as well as the old Latin version of St Jerome conform in some degree to the Syriac though not intirely for they construe it  in adolescentia  not in adolescentia  ejus  which is sufficiently clear without having recourse to Dr Kennicott's  See his sermon preached before the university of Ox∣ford in Note page  expedient of supposing a corruption in the present Heb text to enable him to read  in his youth  as if it had been wrote originally    Nevertheless it appears to me that the common English translation of this passage is to be preferred and that the word must here necessarily signify a  maid  or  virgin  for the writer seems to allude to the secret artifices and allurements used by a man in order to seduce a virgin such  artifices  as are hinted at in Exodus xxii  And if a man  entice  a  maid    c therefore a word signifying merely a young woman or one that was not esteemed a virgin would not have been so suit∣able to the context of either of these passages The  way  of a harlot was too wellknown in former days as well as the present to be esteemed a mystery and much less a mystery to Solomon who had  threescore queens  fourscore concubines  and vir∣gins without number  See Canticles vi But it is not at all unnatural to suppose that this eastern monarch with all his wisdom might sometimes be perplexed with doubts and jealousies concerning the virtue and private conduct of some of those females as well virgins as others with respect to other men this it seems was by him esteemed as diffi∣cult to be traced as the way of a ship in the sea an eagle in the air c By the sin of the adulte∣rous woman to which the preceding similies allude as being equally uninvestigable  Such  is the way of an adulterous woman she eateth and wipeth her mouth and saith I have done no wicked∣ness Prov xxx  Solomon repre∣sents  the great difficulty of detecting the inconstancy of any particular persons in the two former classes I mean his queens and concubines and he would not find it less difficult for some time at least to trace out the  way  or behaviour of private admi∣rers towards the third class of his women that were esteemed  virgins  in the eyes of the world  In confirmation of this I must observe that the strictness of the law of Moses rendered the ob∣servance of secrecy absolutely necessary to offenders in this way for if a man was found guilty of  se∣ducing a virgin  see Exodus xxii he was obli∣ged not only to pay a heavy fine to the young wo∣man's father and to take her for his wife but was likewise deprived of an indulgence which of all others seemed most agreeable to the libidinous disposition of the Jews at that time and was al∣lowed them by Moses only on account  of the hard∣ness of their hearts  see Matthew xix I mean  the giving a bill of divorce  for in this case when a man was obliged to marry one whom he had se∣duced he might  not put her away all his days  See Deut xxii A punishment of greater morti∣fication to the Jews than any other which the learned Philo though himself a Jew candidly ac∣knowledges  Fol Paris Edition    This certainly was a sufficient cause for secrecy on the man's part so that whether  his way  or behaviour  with a maid  was really criminal or only imprudent for either of them may be implied in the text he would as much as possible conceal it from the world and render it as  uninvestigable  as the other things mentioned in the text to be too wonderful for Solomon at least his best endea∣vours would not be wanting to make it so  Neither can we suppose that the same earnest en∣deavours would be wanting on the young woman's part to conceal her disgrace from her friends as long as she could But the reasons for secrecy are far more obvious in the case of espoused virgins for according to the law of Moses Deut xxii if a man was base enough to seduce one of these an ignominious death was to be the immediate and dreadful consequence of a discovery when both parties must share the same wretched fate  Deut xxii    Now if all that I have said shall not be thought sufficient to prove that  in this passage must necessarily signify a maid or virgin I have never∣theless the satisfaction of observing that the author of the objections in page allows it to be  a very obscure passage  and professes to  lay no stress upon it  and therefore I think I may safely conclude at least that it is incapable of  proving any thing against the true sense of the word in the other passages  The same author observes in page that "other  four places are absolutely uncertain  " but they appear in a very different light to me  In the first of these places Genesis xxiv the word is applied to Rebekah before her mar∣riage who in the same chapter is said expresly to be a  virgin      neither had any man known her  See th verse  In the second place Exodus ii it is applied to Moses's sister who watched her infant brother during the time of his being exposed in the little ark of bulrushes  Now it does not appear that Moses had any other sister besides Miriam the prophetess see Numb xxvi and Exodus xv and why her chas∣tity should be called in question especially so early in life I know not  In the third place Psalm lxviii this word with the context expresses the damsels playing with timbrels in the solemn processions of the sanctuary who had they been damsels suspected of having  "wrought folly in Israel"  Deut xxii    that she die because she  hath wrought folly in Israel  to play the whore in her father's house so shalt thou put evil away from among you  they surely would not have been permitted to join in this divine service  The last of these four places which the Doctor thinks  "absolutely uncertain"  is Canticles i where the same word is applied to the virgins that waited on Solomon's spouse But this uncertainty is easily removed by the other passage in Canticles chap vi ver where the same word is happily applied to the same persons who must be under∣stood to be virgins because as Dr Wms him∣self acknowledges in page    I shall here add further that  occurs only seven times in all one of which has the appearance of  being decisive in the case  namely Canticles vi where virgins  are distinguished from queens and concubines  But this distinction is no proof at all because the same in∣deed a stronger distinction is made Ezek xliv in favour of    they  are distin∣guished from queens and concubines  This one would suppose to be an insurmountable obstacle to the Doctor's argument but he passes very slightly over the difficulty and contents him∣self with informing us that  this distinction  is no proof at all because the same indeed a stronger distinction is made Ezek  xliv  in favour of    Now I hope the Doctor will excuse my want of discernment in not being able to discover  the weight of this reason  against so strong a proof as the dis∣tinction in question because if  is proved  ever so clearly to signify strictly  a virgin  and in∣deed I know no reason why any person should doubt of it yet it is no argument why the other may not  likewise signify the same thing  for the word  maid  by having this signification in English does not oblige us to give a different signification to the English word  virgin  therefore I think I may safely conclude in the Doctor's own words that this last text  has the appearance of being decisive in the case  see page and that the word  cannot signify a young woman that is not a virgin because by the same word in the plural number according to the author's own observation  vir∣gins  The ingenious author of the new translation of Solo∣mon's Song observes in his annotations p that  the Jewish maidens before marriage were under such strict confinement and so rarely suffered to appear in public that the very name for a virgin in Hebrew is  hidden  This word is well explained by the learned Stockins p  "  Generatim    vi originis  notat  latentem  "    Speciatim a proprie  notat  virginem  quae domi latitat continetur nec adhuc cum quoquam rem habuit Ita dicitur de Rebecca nondum propalam nuptam educta Gen xxiv de Mirjam quae nondum rem cum quoquam habuerat Ex ii de puella incorrupta illibata cui vir insidiatur ut ea potiatur Prov xxx de matre Immanuelis illibata concubitus ignara Jes vii  β  Metaphorice virginum  nomine veniunt  pii saluandi  ad indicandum eorum animi integritatem puritatem tam in doctrina cultu divino quam in vita moribus Cant i vi  c Christiani Stockii Clavis Linguae sanctae Veteris Testamenti vocabulorum significationes tum  generales  tum  speciales  ordine concinno exhibens c  are distinguished from queens and concu∣bines  I propose now to examine whether we may safely acquiesce with the author of the Critical Disserta∣tion fo and the authors of the Critical Review No fo in their opinion that Isaiah in his prophecy concerning Immanuel in the seventh chapter th th th and th verses  had no reference to the Messiah  Dr Wms objects in page that the th verse of the seventh chapter of Isaiah  cannot in any sense be applied to the Messiah  The words of this text according to the English translation are as follows  For before  the child shall  know to refuse the evil and choose the good the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kings  This verse seems to be the principal cause of his objections against the common interpretation of the two preceding verses  Now though I do not think with him that these three verses  must of necessity relate  to the same per∣son yet I apprehend there is a great probability  that  they may  and that the th verse may reason∣ably be accounted for even when applied to the Messiah Dr Wms approves of the meaning given to the word  in the th verse by Mr Mann viz that it may signify  "vexest"  instead of  abhorrest    the land which thou Ahaz  vexest  with thy idolatry  See fo Thus far he favours the explication which I propose to give of this passage but then he supposes that  the land which Ahaz vexed  signifies the land of Judah  only  The prophet meant  to say according to this au∣thor says the Doctor that the land  of Judah  which Ahaz by his idolatry and wickedness had brought into trouble and difficulty should be delivered from  both these kings  fo by which the Doctor refers to  Resin  king of Syria and  Pekah  the son of Remaliah king of Israel who at that time were confederate against  Judah  and  went up towards Jerusalem to war against it  See the first part of the same chapterThe Doctor repeats the same thing in page vizthe land  of Ju∣dah  which thou Ahaz vexest c This throws great difficulty upon the text which informs us that the land which Ahaz vexed should  be for∣saken of both  her kings  The construction of the word rendered  "her kings"  requires us to un∣derstand that both the kings there spoken of should be kings of that land which Ahaz vexed  "both her kings"  Now  Pekah king of Israel  cannot be understood to be one of these if the land which Ahaz vexed signified the land of Judah alone for in what sense could he be called one of the kings of the  land of Judah  who was not a conqueror for the true king still maintained his royal seat and title but a de∣clared enemy and disturber and  king only of Is∣rael  Neither could Resin king of Syria be properly said to be either king of Judah or Israel for he was only an invader of Judah acting as an ally to the king of Israel  Though indeed he had rather more right to be accounted one of  the kings of Judah  than the king of Israel had because about that time he had taken possession of  Elath a city of Judah  but this could not really intitle him to be called a king of that land because from the time that the city was ta∣ken it ceased to be a part of  Judah  and was ac∣counted a part of the  kingdom of Syria  for it is expresly said in Kings xvi that  Resin king of Syria  recovered Elath  to Syria  and  drave the Jews from  Elath and the  Syrians  came to Elath and  dwelt there unto this day  Dr Wms observes in a note page that  Resin and Pekah are perhaps here called the kings of Judah because they were then in possession of all the country Jerusalem excepted  but the Doctor surely did not consider that Isaiah was sent to confirm Ahaz  that he should not fear  the two tails of these smoking firebrands  viz Resin and the son of Remaliah and to assure him that their evil council of  setting up a king in Judah should "not stand"  nor  "come to pass"  It is not likely therefore that the prophet should call either or both of these kings  kings of Judah  because it would have been absolutely a contradiction to his message which was to encourage and establish  the then reigning king of Judah  descended from the house of David Even the Doctor himself seems so sensible of the insufficiency of his interpretation that he after∣wards in the same note proposes another expe∣dient though a dangerous  Thus it happens with these sacred books as with prophane authors that when the  medica manus critico∣rum  is to perform an operation upon the text it is often dislocated and maimed and rendered almost incurable by improper applications But whatever may be done with the historical books we have no right to indulge any conjectural emendations in the prophecies it looks too much like tampering with evidence If they are faulty they must even remain so and we must take the evidence as it comes to us  Dr Gregory Sharpe's d Argument in Defence of Christianity p  one in hopes of solv∣ing the difficulty for the text not being capable of serving his purpose as it stands at present the pro∣phet himself must be corrected  This is esteemed a much easier thing nowadays than for a critic to give up a favorite opinion that happens to be contradictory to the Holy Scripture  Suppose says the Doctor that we should read  for  her kings shall be forsaken of both kings  this indeed is cutting the knot but it will not enable the Doctor to come off con∣queror like the Grecian hero If the omission of the word  in the Septuagint translation should even be allowed to afford sufficient grounds for such a supposition yet  Dr Kennicott's truly important work  is not likely to furnish various readings from MSS equal in authority and antiquity with those from which Aquila Symmachus and Theo∣dotion were taken These were manifestly accord∣ing to the present Heb text in this passage for it is rendered by all these translators  of  her  two kings or of both  her  kings  The ancient Syriac version likewise confirms the text  both her kings  It would have been time enough to have quoted Dr Kenni∣cott's various reading when it was known that any such subsistedfor it is not fair dealing to wound the credit of the holy text with a mere  "perhaps"  Dr Kennicott's truly important work may  perhaps  hereafter  strengthen this conjecture  In a note fo  and for no other purpose if I may use the Dr's  own words than to  "strengthen  a  conjecture"  In short I would advise the Doctor to let the text re∣main as he found it for this unjustifiable method of solving difficulties is a broken reed which sel∣dom fails to wound the hands of those who use it  Now the difficulty ceases if it be admitted that the  land which Ahaz vexed  signified the land or in∣heritance of the twelve tribes of Israel including Judah which construction the circumstances of those times will enable it to bear  Ahaz had interrupted the sacrifices of atonement usually offered up for  all Israel  in the temple at Jerusalem which was common to Jews and Israe∣lites and therefore might truly be said to  vex  the land of Israel as well as Judah for he not only  "sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus"  Chron xxviii but he  cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God and  shut up the doors of the house of the Lord  th verse King Heze∣kiah  See Chron xxix  who opened again the doors of the house of the Lord and caused the priests and Levites to cleanse all the house from the abominations of Ahaz was conscious that his father by the inter∣ruption of divine service beforementioned had  vexed Israel  as well as Judah and therefore made all the amends that lay in his power He caused  "an atonement"  to be made  "for all Israel"  for  the king  commanded that the burnt offering and the sin offering should be  made for all Israel  Chron xxix  He likewise  sent to  all Israel  and Judah and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh that they should come to the house of the Lord at Jerusalem to keep the passover unto the Lord God  of Israel  Chron xxx And we read in the th verse of the same chapter that  divers of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun hum∣bled themselves accordingly and came to Je∣rusalem  and  "did eat the passover"  See th verse Now as it appears that the  land of all the other tribes  as well as the  land of Judah  was really vexed by the apostasy of Ahaz there is reason to suppose that  the land of Immanuel  mentioned by Isaiah viii might signify not only  the land of Judah  but the land of  both the houses  of  Israel  mentioned in the th verse of the same chapter and that the  two kings  of the land mentioned in the seventh chapter may mean the kings or  separate regal powers  of these two houses of Israel which were  both to cease before the child  Immanuel  should know to refuse the evil and choose the good  The word  or king in a figu∣rative way of speaking may very well be under∣stood in some passages not to mean merely the person of one particular king but in a more gene∣ral sense to signify  a succession of kings  or rather  the  regal constitution of a state  and the failure of such royalty in some cases serves as a distinguishing mark of conquest or subjection to a foreign power  The king shall perish from Gaza and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited  says the prophet Zechariah ix by which is plainly understood not the de∣struction of a single king but the ceasing of the regal government of the city of Gaza It is a sy∣nonimous term with the  departing of the sceptre  The pride of Assyria shall be brought down and  the sceptre of Egypt  shall depart away  says the same prophet in the th verse of the succeeding chapter The prophet Hosea likewise uses the word  in the same general sense xi  "the Assyrian or Assur shall be his king"  one Assyrian king only  cannot here be meant but the succession of kings reigning in Assyria during the captivity of Israel Therefore I presume there is some ground for my supposition that Isaiah's ex∣pression in the seventh chapter  may signify  the two separate regal governments  of Judah and Israel called in the twentythird chapter of Ezechiel Aholah and Aholibah and not merely two single kings  When I first wrote this opinion and communi∣cated the MS to Dr Wms I apprehended that the thought was intirely newso little am I ac∣quainted with the republic of letters for want of leisure and opportunity to read I must therefore  acknowledge myself obliged to Dr Wms for his information that the learned Mr Mann in his dissertation De anno natali Christi  appears to be of the same opinion  I had likewise the satisfac∣tion afterwards to be informed by another gen∣tleman a worthy friend of mine that the same in∣terpretation is recommended in the Universal Hist vol IV of the Octavo p with the note K  Now that the opinion of the learned author may more clearly be understood I will set down at length the whole that he wrote upon the text in question  Having mentioned the subject of Isaiah's mes∣sage to Ahaz he adds  Here the king whe∣ther out of respect or despondency and unbelief refusing to ask the promised sign the prophet assured him from the Lord thatbefore  that time  came a virgin should conceive and bear a son and call his name Himmanuel or God with us and so on  K  Upon this opinion he further explains himself in the following note  K This we take to be a much more natural sense of that prophecy than to suppose as some have done that such a miraculous child was really born in Ahaz's time to assure him of the promised deliverance for as there is not the least mention of such an extraordinary birth so neither do we see that there was any necessity for  it in order to convince the desponding king who could not be ignorant of that prophecy of Jacob that the sceptre should not depart from Judah till Shiloh was come much less that he was to spring of the lineage of David But what staggered Ahaz's faith and made him fear that the regal power was going to depart from his family was that his two enemies had combined to set a stranger on his throne All therefore that was wanting to dispel his present fears about it was for the prophet to assure him from God that this Shiloh promised to Judah and David who was to forerun the total excision of the Jewish polity was to be born in a miraculous manner and with a divine character and other remarkable circumstances such as he might be easily satisfied had not as yet happened in his kingdom  As for that part of the prophecy which is com∣monly urged on the other side namely  Before this wonderful child shall know good from evil the land which thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kings  We think that if it be rightly un∣derstood it will rather confirm our sense of the prophecy and that the words ought to be thus rendered For or rather as the particle  chi  seems to import here nay before this child can know good from evil this land which thou not abhorrest as our version renders it but art so  solicitous about or givest up for lost shall be bereaved of both her kings by which we think ought to be understood not the kings of Syria and Israel for the former could not be called her Canaan's king and the latter had but a share in it at best  but the kings of Israel  and  Judah  as it really was before the coming of the Messiah  In order to confirm this opinion I have annexed to these remarks two distinct dissertations one on the prophecy of Isaiah vii  and within threescore and five years shall Ephraim be bro∣ken that it be not a people  and the other on the famous prophecy of Jacob concerning the sceptre of Judah  In the former I shew that the  regal government  of the  house of Israel  as a separate state from Ju∣dah was put an end to not a great many years after Isaiah's prophecy  In the latter I hope I have proved that the re∣gal government of the house of Judah I mean only the temporal or worldly kingdom of Judah ceased precisely at the time limited by Isaiah in the prophecy now before us So that I flatter myself it will appear upon the whole that the land of Is∣rael including Judah being the land which Ahaz  vexed  was forsaken of  "both her kings"  or regal governments before the child Immanuel could  "know to refuse the evil and choose the good"  For Herod the Great on a careful examination I believe will be found to have been the last king of  the whole land  of  Israel and Judah  which Ahaz  vexed  and it is remarkable that Christ the true Immanuel  was a young child in the arms of his mother  at the time of this monarch's death soon after which Joseph the husband of the blessed vir∣gin was warned by an angel of the Lord in Egypt saying  Arise and take THE YOUNG CHILD and his mother and go into the  land of Israel  not the land of  Judah  only  for they are  dead  which sought the  young child  's life  Matth ii  But Dr Wms in a note page observes that the child Immanuel  could not be Christ  be∣cause  he is never called the king of Judah  And he thinks that Nathaniel when he called him  the king of Israel  laboured  under the same mistake with all his countrymen who expected a tem∣poral Messiah  The Doctor observes in the same note that  "Christ is king of the whole earth"  which he seems to assign as a reason why  he is never called the king of Judah  And indeed it does not appear that the Doctor had any other foundation for his censure of Natha∣niel though this argument is so far from being conclusive in favour of the Doctor's opinion that it rather proves the contrary for he that is king of  the whole earth  must necessarily in a general sense be king of Israel and Judah these titles  being most certainly included in the former even supposing the peculiar sceptre of each kingdom to be departed  Nevertheless the argument such as it is is ad∣mitted and approved by the Critical Reviewers for they quote the Doctor's words at length see N  o  fo without offering any thing to jus∣tify Nathaniel from the charge of  labouring under a mistake  It shall therefore be my business to prove that the mistake does  not rest with Nathaniel  Christ is in a peculiar manner eternal king of Judah and Israel as well as king of the whole earth and  heir of all things  Heb i The angel Ga∣briel testified that Christ should  reign over the house of Jacob which is Israel  for ever See St Luke i And the wise men of the East  went to Je∣rusalem  and inquired  Where is he that  is born king of the Jews  for we have seen his star in the East and come  that is to Jerusalem the capital of his kingdom  "to worship him"  See Matth ii Therefore the Doctor's objection that the child Immanuel could not be Christ  be∣cause he is never called the king of Judah  seems to be intirely groundless for the dominion of the land of Immanuel mentioned in the eighth chapter of Isaiah may most certainly be attributed with more propriety to the Messiah who  was king  and  shep∣herd  of Israel  see Ezek xxxvii also xxxiv than to any son of Isaiah whatever  Dr Wms may perhaps suppose that the king∣doms of Israel and Judah could not belong to Christ because he refused to accept of any temporal go∣vernment and withdrew himself when he perceived that the people would come and take him by force to  make him a king  see John vi and further because he even declared that his kingdom was not of this world See chap xviii But all this seems to relate only to the manner of his govern∣ment which in general was merely spiritual He was nevertheless  king of Israel  being sent in a par∣ticular manner to the lost sheep of the house of Is∣rael see Matth xv and for a time Jerusa∣lem was  the seat of his kingdom  when he went up to the feast and a very great multitude spread their garments in the way a greater mark of submission than is ever paid to temporal princes and others cut down branches from the trees and strawed them in the way see Matth xxi and cried  Hosanna Blessed is the  KING OF ISRAEL that cometh in the name of the Lord John xii  Christ did not tell the multitude that they  la∣boured  under a mistake  in calling him KING OF ISRAEL on the contrary it appears that he ap∣proved of the voice of the people which could not have been the case had he not been really  king of Israel  for when the pharisees said unto him  Master rebuke thy disciples he answered and said unto them  I tell you that if these should  hold their peace the stones would immediately cry out  Luke xix Thus was the Messiah not only  "called" but proclaimed king of Israel  and as such he received the homage of his people yet in such a manner as best suited the sacred character of him who had  rejected a worldly kingdom  for instead of royal apparel and a triumphal car he was  "cloathed with humility"  and sitting on an ass that the prophecy of Zechariah might be literally fulfilled  Rejoice greatly O daughter of Zion shout O daughter of Jerusalem behold THY KING cometh unto thee he is just and having salva∣tion  lowly  and riding upon an ass and upon a colt the foal of an ass  Zech ix But though Christ professed that his kingdom was not of this world yet there was no worldly man hardy enough to resist or oppose his will when he was pleased to exert his divine authority over them for  he cast out them that sold and bought in the temple and overthrew the tables of the money∣changers and the seats of them that sold doves and  would not suffer  that any man should carry any vessel through the temple  Mark xi  And St John informs us chap ii that he made a scourge of small cords and drove them all all such as are abovementioned out of the temple  Of all the extraordinary things which Christ did St Jerome thought this to be the most wonderful as Mr Bragge remarks in his Practical Observations upon the Miracles This personal authority and do∣minion of Christ  in Israel  was expresly foretold by the prophet Micah chap v  But thou Beth∣lehem Ephratah though thou be little among the thousands of Judah yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be RULER IN IS∣RAEL whose goings forth have been from of old  In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God The same was in the beginning with God  John i  from everlasting  I never read any passage of Scripture which was capable of affording the least countenance or support to the contrary doctrine that  Christ was not the king of Israel  Indeed the enemies and persecutors of our Lord at the time of his crucifixion expressed their disbelief of his being king of Israel  If he be  the king of Israel  said they let him now come down from the cross and we will believe him  Matth xxvii  because they did not think him to be the true anointed or Messiah Nevertheless when the several extraordinary and miraculous cir∣cumstances relating to the birth life death and persecution of that most holy person Jesus of Na∣zareth are candidly examined and carefully com∣pared  with the prophetical declarations concerning the promised Messiah it manifestly appears that there were very sufficient reasons for acknowledg∣ing that person to be both  Lord and Christ  "Therefore let all the HOUSE  of Israel  know assu∣redly that God hath made  that same Jesus whom ye have crucified  both  Lord and Christ"  Acts ii  "And the angel said unto them the shepherds Fear not for behold I bring unto you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people For unto you is born this day  in the city of David  a saviour  which is Christ the Lord  " Luke ii  "The Word which God sent unto the  children of Israel  preaching peace by Jesus  Christ he is Lord  of all" Acts x  "But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our glory Which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it they would not have cru∣cified the  Lord of glory  " Corinth ii  "That every tongue should confess that Jesus  Christ  is  Lord  to the glory of God the father" Philip ii  and consequently  "king  of  Israel"  in the strictest sense not only during his bodily residence on earth but to all eternity Wherefore we ought most certainly to acquit Nathaniel and other faithful Israelites of the  mistake  which they have lately been supposed to  "labour under"  when they declared our Lord Jesus Christ to be  "the king of Israel"  John i xii  Thus far I have ventured to suggest in answer to Dr Wms's declaration in page that "the th verse" of the seventh chap of Isaiah  "cannot in any sense be applied to the Messiah"  I hope I have proved that it may nevertheless I must observe that even the common interpretation of this passage is not so unreasonable as Dr Wms seems to imagine though indeed the interpreta∣tion before given appears to be much less liable to exception  The Doctor animadverts severely on the opinion of those who say that the passage contains two dis∣tinct propheciesviz that the verses and relate to Christ but the th to Isaiah's son  Is not this  says he  very unnatural and if I am not mistaken very unusual  But the authors of the old commentary on the Bible commonly called Assemblies Annotations were of a very different opinion  They observe on this very text that  it is an usual thing  in Scripture with our prophet Isaiah especially by way of allusion to apply the same words and phrases unto divers subjects where occasion is to speak of them together  and therefore they were of opinion that the child men∣tioned in the th verse was  no other in all like∣lihood than Shearjashub the prophet's child whom to this purpose God hath commanded him to take along with him  How far this was  an usual thing with Isaiah may be seen even in prophecies which were delivered on the same occa∣sion as the text in question  For the further illustration of this point I have added to my book a short dissertation on the nature and style of prophetical writings shewing that abrupt transitions from one subject to another are frequently found therein and that the Holy Scrip∣tures afford many examples of prophecies which are blended and interwoven with other subjects that are intirely different both as to the matter and the time of accomplishment  We must not expect to find all prophecies unat∣tended with difficulties nevertheless there are no difficulties in the seventh chapter of Isaiah so great as those that are occasioned by Dr Wms's in∣terpretation of it  This prophecy says he as I take it relates to  one person only  and that  was the son of a young woman then present  which son was afterwards to be born  See page  Now I may ask with Origen    contra Celsum pag Cambridge Edition  Who was born in the time of Ahaz of whose birth this is  saidEmanuel  that is  GOD WITH US For if no one is found it is manifest that what was said to Ahaz was addressed to  the house of  DAVID according to that which was writtenvizof the  seed of David a saviour is born according to the flesh  Indeed we read in the eighth chapter of a son which the prophetess conceived and bare unto Isaiah and likewise that Isaiah was careful to take unto him FAITHFUL WITNESSES TO RECORD con∣cerning him  for said he before the child shall have knowledge to cry My father and my mo∣ther which must be within two years the RICHES of DAMASCUS and the SPOIL of SAMA∣RIA shall be taken away before the king of As∣syria  Therefore this child was certainly the TEMPORARY SIGN of the promised deliverance from the  two powers  of DAMASCUS and SAMARIA but unfortunately for Dr Wms's hypothesis the said child was NOT CALLED IMMANUEL but MAHER∣SHALALHASHBAZ  properly sig∣nifying and prefiguring the  near approach of the spoiling of Damascus and Samaria  Now we do not read of any other child born at that time as a sign and therefore Dr Wms's opinion concerning Immanuel is not only a  mere supposition  but a very improbable one since it is not at all likely that TWO CHILDREN were then born one  Mahershalalhashbaz  and the other  Immanuel  and both of them  intended as MERE TEMPORARY SIGNS OF THE SAME THING  The Doctor will find on a further examination of the text that the birth of Isaiah's son is only an  allusion  or  imperfect imitation  of the former REMOTE SIGN mentioned in the seventh chapter viz of Im∣manuel's birth in the same manner as the  brazen serpent  And the Lord said unto Moses Make thee a fiery serpent and set it upon a pole and it shall come to pass that every one that is bitten when he looketh upon it shall live And Moses made a serpent of brass and put it upon a pole and it came to pass that if a serpent had bitten any man when he beheld the  serpent of brass  he lived  Numb xxi  And as Moses lifted up THE SERPENT in the wilderness even so must THE SON of MAN BE LIFTED UP that whosoever believeth in him SHOULD NOT PERISH but have eternal life  John iii See Mr Cruden's excellent remarks on these texts under the word SERPENT in his Concor∣dance  lifted up  in the wilderness was an imperfect imitation or type of Christ crucified and that the TEMPORARY DELIVERANCE from the  two kings  of which the birth of Isaiah's son was the TEMPORARY SIGN cannot rightly be considered as the accom∣plishment of the prophecy but rather as  a confir∣mation  and  sure pledge  of the said REMOTE SIGN as I have before observed  "But when the  FULNESS OF TIME  was come"  the angel Gabriel was sent from God to Nazareth with a FURTHER REVELATION of the then approaching SIGN of the redemption promised by Isaiah  The  blessed virgin  answered Luke i  How shall this be seeing that I know not a man  That  "a woman should compass a man"  viz conceive and bear a son without the knowledge of man this was an event scarcely to be expected or comprehended by man it being the  new thing  which God had created in the earth spoken of by the prophet Jeremiah xxxi  "How long wilt thou go about O thou backsliding daughter the virgin of Israel for the Lord hath created A NEW THING in the EARTH a WOMAN shall COMPASS A MAN" Jerem xxxi  So that it was plainly the  seed of the woman  which bruised the ser∣pent's head as promised in Genesis iii  "And I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and HER SEED IT SHALL BRUISE THY HEAD and thou shalt bruise his heel" Gen iii  The occasion of Isaiah's prophecy concerning the miraculous birth of Immanuel is mentioned in the beginning of the seventh chapter  Because Syria Ephraim and the son of Remaliah have taken evil council against thee Ahaz saying Let us go up against Judah and vex it and let us make a breach therein for us and  set  A KING  IN THE MIDST OF IT even the son of Tabeal  But  thus saith the Lord God  It shall not stand neither shall it come to pass  Now this was a confirmation of the promise made by God to David and delivered by Nathan the prophet Sam vii viz  Thine house  and  thy kingdom  shall be established for ever be∣fore thee THY THRONE shall be established for EVER  Therefore as Justin Martyr observes  Justini Dialogus cum Try∣phone Judaeo pag Paris Edition  if the prophecy  "Behold a virgin shall conceive"  had not been spoken to the house of David but to any other house of the twelve tribes the affair might have been doubtful but the sign was really given to the HOUSE OF DAVID see th verse  Hear ye now O house of David  and as no man was  ever born of a virgin  except the MESSIAH who on account of this birth was called the SON OF DA∣VID therefore it was surely the properest sign that could be given to assure them that the  house  and the KINGDOM of DAVID  should be established for ever  and that the evil council of Syria and Ephraim should not stand The house and the kingdom of David cannot be established FOR EVER in the per∣son of any of David's descendants except the Mes∣siah himself for with respect to the present times the worldly kingdom of David ceased very many ages ago and his people the children of Israel be∣ing most deservedly ejected on account of their wickedness and unbelief from their old inheritance the land of Canaan have never since obtained any other as a possession but for near seventeen hun∣dred years have been dispersed throughout the whole world and yet by the manifest providence  See Bishop Newton's Dissertation on the Prophecies st vol p to where that learned author treats very fully and pathetically concerning the remarkable pro∣vidence of God in the preservation of the Jews  of God they remain to this day in the  midst of all nations a distinct  and  peculiar people  so that their present state is an authentic and undeniable voucher of the truth of the Holy Scriptures  What is occasionally said by Moses and other pro∣phets concerning the future state of God's people the Jews is alone sufficient to establish the divine authority of the holy writings The promises made to them are li∣terally fulfilled the vengeance denounced against them is literally inflicted Captives they were frequently made wanderers they became and such they continue to be at this day sojourning in the midst of all nations united with none peculiars every where and by no human means to be again consolidated  which is altogether as wonderful as if the waters of any one particular river should remain in distinct globules though scattered through the whole ocean  Dr Gregory Sharpe's d Argument in Defence of Christianity c page    and themselves a living testimony of God's just judgment  which they still lie under until they shall repent  But Christ's  spiritual kingdom of Israel  into which we are adopted is everlasting and the prophet Isaiah gave Ahaz and his cotemporaries of  the house of David  the strongest assurances that it should be so  Of the increase of his govern∣ment and peace  says he in the ninth chapter which I have already shewn to have been delivered nearly at the same time with the seventh chapter  there shall be  NO END  upon the throne of David and upon his kingdom to order it and to establish it with judgment and with justice  from henceforth even for ever the zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this  In page Dr Wms says  The last ob∣jection which I know that can be made to my sense of the passage is that it is utterly incon∣sistent with the words of St Matthew chap i  Here I must intirely agree with the Doctor though I am not the better satisfied with his hypo∣thesis  Now that we may thoroughly understand the text in question it will be necessary to consider St Matthew's application of it  He informs us that  the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph before they came toge∣ther she was found with  child of the Holy Ghost  Then Joseph her husband being a just man and not willing to make her a public example was minded to put her away privily But while he thought on these things behold the  angel of the Lord  appeared unto him in a dream saying Joseph THOU SON OF DAVID fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife for  that which is con∣ceived in her  IS OF THE HOLY GHOST And she shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name Jesus  for he shall  save his people  from their sins NOW ALL THIS  was done that it might be fulfilled  which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet saying Behold A VIRGIN shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name EMMANUEL which being interpreted is  God with us  Now Dr Wms hopes to excuse himself and his hypo∣thesis by alledging see page that this is only  an accommodation  by  way of illustration  not  proof of a passage to a particular sense to which it  originally had no reference  But should we not seem to pay very little regard to Gospel testimony I now speak as to Christians if we were to suppose that the prophecy  originally had no reference  to this event when an apostle  ex∣presly affirms  that it had  Might not Dr Doddridge's observation quoted in page of the Crit Dissert be then with more justice urged against us viz  This way of pro∣ceeding will make the Scriptures the most un∣certain writings in the world  But now let us see how this notion of  an accommodation  will suit with the rest of the Doctor's hypothesis  He says page  I think that the prophet had  no reference to the Messiah  and that the evan∣gelist only alludes to this passage in Isaiah be∣cause it was  remarkably suitable  to the matter which he was relating  Now the Doctor seems to have forgot his former opinion in page viz  that the word  doth not appear to  signify strictly a virgin  For if this were true that  doth not sig∣nify a virgin in what sense could the text be esteemed  remarkably suitable  to the miraculous con∣ception of a VIRGIN by the HOLY GHOST and in what manner could the  accommodation of it  to that  singular event  assist the sacred historian  BY WAY OF ILLUSTRATION  See page  Nay the Doctor has even taken great pains to render the text REMARKABLY UNSUITABLE for he would have us understand that  the YOUNG WOMAN as he construes it spoken of in the text was so  far from being a  VIRGIN that she was with child "IS CONCEIVING and BEARING a SON" says he in page even at the time when she was pointed at as he supposes in page by the pro∣phet These words viz  IS CONCEIVING and BEARING a SON  are a part of what he has given us in page as a  literal translation  of the ori∣ginal  but it is so far from being so that the true sense of  the letter  or text seems to be ex∣changed for that of the interlineary version of the London Polyglot which renders it  praegnans pariens  But the words  are not participles active but are in the perfect tense yet there needs no apology for the Septuagint and other translations in rendering them as if they were of the  future  tense because the sentence to which they belong is plainly the prediction of a  future  event    It is a wellknown observation of the Christian and Jewish doctors that the prophet seeing in his mind's eye the events he foretels often speaks of them as al∣ready past  Dr Sharpe's d Argument in Defence of Christianity p in a note  for in prophetical writings the perfect is frequently used  for the  future  tense  Apud prophetas autem cre∣berrime praeteritum pro futuro usurpatur quo res certò futûra significetur perinde ac si jam evenisset ut puer  natus est nobis pro nas∣cetur  BYTHNER Institutio Linguae sanctae p Dr Wms's  literal translation  as he calls it of the  perfect  tense into the  participle  active can∣not I believe be so easily vindicated  Would it not be very unnatural to suppose that the prophets have been intirely silent concerning this most remarkable sign of the Messiah viz his being BORN OF A VIRGIN insomuch that an evan∣gelist should be obliged to ACCOMMODATE to this  singular circumstance  a passage which originally had  "no reference to  THE MESSIAH" And that he should attempt to pass such a MERE ACCOMMODA∣TION upon the world for the genuine sense of the prophet by signifying in the strongest terms that this text was  fulfilled  by the circumstances which he there relates  The evangelist thus expresses himself  Now ALL THIS WAS DONE that it  might be fulfilled  which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet  c  c which implies that if ALL THIS had not come to pass the  word of the Lord by the prophet  would not have  been fulfilled  therefore this case is by no  means similar to the instances of ACCOMMODATION drawn from the GRECIAN POETS  The learned author whom Dr Wms has quoted in page has made a very necessary reserve on this head which the Doctor has omitted in his quotation viz  But indeed to an attentive mind the difference will appear very great between the citations from prophane authors and the prophets  in page  But why should any one attempt nowadays to explain away the genuine meaning of a prophecy  so literally fulfilled  by the miraculous birth of Christ when even  the Jewish interpreters  near years i e according to the Chronicon of Eusebius years before that wonderful event had construed the same prophecy in such a manner that it could not possibly be applied to any person whatsoever except the promised Messiah who ALONE WAS BORN OF A VIRGIN  This testimony of the Septuagint was taken no∣tice of by Origen contra Celsum  c Quod si Judaeus vocabula excutiens neget scrip∣tum  Ecce virginem  fed  Ecce adolescentula  dicêmus ibi legi vocem ALMA quam Septuaginta interpretes verterunt virginem c Cambridge Edition p  p and is certainly of much greater authority in favour of the true sense of the word  rendered by  them    a virgin  than any thing that Dr Wms has offered against it  It is remarkable that all the ancient MSS of the Septuagint in different parts of the world tes∣tify the truth of this reading of which four in par∣ticular are of considerable authority on account of their very great antiquity viz the Vatican Alex∣andrian Complutensian and Venetian MSS And though many copies of the Septuagint must have been in the hands of Jews as well as others both before and after the birth of Christ yet I never heard that any person ever produced a copy which con∣tradicted this original reading for as the Septuagint was the common translation used in the synagogues throughout all Asia Greece and Egypt see Bp Walton's Prolegomena ix p N  o  any alte∣ration in so remarkable a text as this would very soon have been discovered  And it must also be remembered that the seve∣ral Greek translations wherein the word  is rendered  a  young woman  viz that of Aquila Theodotion and Symmachus were all made  after the birth of Christ  when the unbelieving Jews were desirous of perverting the true meaning of the pro∣phecy  The ancient Syriac version expresses  by the very word viz  from  which the Doctor sets up in opposition to it and which he justly observes must signify strictly a  VIRGIN  The Rabbins always by  mean a  virgin  that they well understand their own language cannot be denied c p See also p where speaking of the Sep∣tuagint translation of Esther ii he adds  whence it must undeniably appear that they understood  to mean  A VIRGIN  in the strictest sense of the word  And lastly St Matthew whether he quoted the Original or Septuagint was certainly convinced that the true sense of the word was  a VIRGIN and he hath accordingly left us his testimony of it which proves that the Doctor's application of this word to  the mother of Isaiah's son  must be very erroneous  The child  Immanuel  could not be Isaiah's son because it appears from so many undeniable testi∣monies that his  mother  was to be really  a virgin  and because  the event itself  by which the prophecy is best understood has proved this truth beyond all contradiction  Wherefore I think I may now safely conclude in Dr Wms's own words before quoted that his opinion concerning this text  IS UTTERLY IN∣CONSISTENT WITH THE WORDS OF ST MAT∣THEW  and of course that the Doctor is  indispen∣sably bound  to yield up his hypothesis to the  superior authority of the evangelist  The  END  of  PART I  A DISSERTATION ON THE NATURE and STYLE OF PROPHETICAL WRITINGS SHEWING That abrupt Transitions from one Subject to another are frequently found therein The same being intended to illustrate the foregoing Remarks on the Critical Dissertation c  A DISSERTATION ON THE NATURE and STYLE OF Prophetical Writings c  THE prophecies contained in the seventh eighth and ninth chapters of Isaiah seem to have been delivered during the general consternation of the house of David occasioned by the invasion of Rezin king of Syria and Pekah king of Israel because several circumstances relating to the said kings and their respective nations are mentioned in each of these chapters  Septimum octavum et nonum Isaiae caput in eodem fere versantur argumento c  P D Huetii Demonstratio Evangelica  p  notwithstanding that the same chapters  contain prophecies of very distant events which are so blended with the transactions of the then present times that it would not be easy to dis∣tinguish the real difference in point of chronology if the apparent accomplishment of these several prophecies did not remove the difficulty Rezin and Pekah are both particularly mentioned in the th chapter wherein the extraordinary birth of the  child Immanuel  is given as a sign The spoiling of their respective cities is promised in the th chapter  "For before the child  Mahershalalhashbaz  shall have knowledge to cry My father and my mother the  riches of Damascus  and the  spoil of Samaria  shall be taken away before the king of Assyria" viii "Forasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of Shiloah that go softly and rejoice in  Rezin  and  Remaliah  's  son  Now therefore behold the Lord bringeth upon them the waters of the river strong and many even the king of  Assyria  " c"And the stretch∣ing out of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land  O Immanuel  " viii  wherein the birth of the child Maher∣shalalhashbaz the son of Isaiah is foretold as the temporary sign of the same and notwithstanding that the greatest part of the said chapter relates to those times yet the prophet introduces in the very midst of it a plain reference to the times of the Messiah see th th th and th verses which shall be hereafter considered In the th chapter the  presumption of Ephraim  and the in∣habitants  of Samaria  "And all the people shall know even  Ephraim  and the inhabitants of  Samaria  that say in the pride and stout∣ness of heart The bricks are fallen down but we will build with hewen stones" c ix "Therefore the Lord shall set up the adversaries of  Rezin  against him" c ix These three verses th th and th and also the st plainly allude to the subject of the th chapter viz the evil council and confederacy of  Syria  and  Ephraim  and God's promise that the same should not stand  is reproved and God's judgments are once more expresly denounced  against Rezin  as if these things were to happen after the birth of the  child  that was to  be called  Wonderful Counsellor the mighty God the ever∣lasting Father the Prince of peace  of the in∣crease of  whose government and peace  there should be  no end  upon the throne of David and upon his kingdom  c for the birth of this divine person is foretold in the former part of the same chapter and yet I never heard of an attempt to apply this prophecy to a son of Isaiah or to any other child born about that time  In the beginning of this th chapter the prophet alludes likewise to some other historical circum∣stances besides what are already mentioned con∣cerning Syria and Ephraim and these had either then lately happened or were very shortly to come to pass notwithstanding that the allusion is  blended with a very distant prophecy concerning the preaching of Christ  The circumstances which I speak of are the Assyrian conquest and captivity of  Zebulun  and  Napthali  which happened in the days of Pekah king of Israel  "In the days of Pekah king of Israel came Tiglath∣pileser king of Assyria and took Ijon and Abelbethmaa∣chah and Janoah and Kedesh and Hazor and Gilead and  Galilee  all the land of Napthali and carried them captive to Assyria"  Kings  xv  This was the affliction  "Nevertheless the dimness shall not be such as was in her vexation when at the first he lightly afflicted the land of  Zebulun  and the land of  Napthali  and afterward did more grievously afflict her by the way of the sea beyond Jor∣dan in  Galilee  of the nations  Isaiah  ix The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light" c ix  by the  way of the sea beyond Jordan in Galilee  of the nations  mentioned by Isaiah ix by which he expresly points out the very spot  Galilee  where  Immanuel  was chiefly to be manifested by his mighty deeds and miracles for the prophet immediately proceeds verse  The people says he  that walked in darkness  This corresponds with the prejudice which the Jews conceived against their brethren the Galilaeans The chief Priests and Pharisees answered Nicodemus saying "Search and look for out of  Galilee  ariseth  no Prophet" John  vii In like manner answered Nathaniel when Philip told him "We have found him of whom Moses in the law and the Prophets did write  Jesus  of Nazareth the son of Joseph" And Nathanael said unto him  Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth  John i  have seen a great light  they  that dwell in the land of the shadow of death upon  them hath the light shined  And after∣wards in the th verse he renews the same promises given in the th chapter concerning the  birth of a divine child  whose attributes and dignity are here so fully expressed by the prophet that they can by no means agree with the character  of any other child  but that which was truly  Immanuel  or  God with us  Therefore it is plain that the pro∣phecies of the th and th chapters were delivered nearly at the same time with those of the th chapter which are further explained and confirmed thereby so that if Dr Wms will carefully ex∣amine all these three chapters he will find that it is  not unusual  See Dr Wms's comment on the opinion of those who say that the th th and th verses of the viith chap of  Isaiah  contain two distinct prophecies "Is not this says he  very unnatural  and if I am not greatly mistaken  very unusual  " p  But an experienced writer who on many occasions has given ample proofs of great learning and scriptureknow∣ledge informs us that  It is  very natural  and  very usual  with the Prophets to make  a transition from one great de∣liverance to another as also from one great destruction to another  and he afterwards gives several remarkable in∣stances of it See Dr  Gregory Sharpe's  d  Argument in Defence of Christianity p    in prophetick writings to make quick and abrupt transitions from one subject to  another  nor unnatural  that a very distant prophecy should be blended with others that were soon to be accomplished because it  is the nature of prophecy  to be delivered in this mysterious manner For says Isaiah xxviii  precept must be or hath been upon precept precept upon precept line upon line line upon line  here a little  and  there a little  For with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak or he hath spoken to this people  And again in the th verse  here a little and there a little  that they might go and fall back∣ward and be broken and snared and taken  The nature and reason of typical writings are strongly expressed in St Mark's Gospel  "And when he Jesus was alone they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable And he said unto them Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God but  unto them that are without all these things are done in parables  that seeing they may see and  not perceive  and hearing they may hear  and not understand  lest at any time they should be converted and their sins should be forgiven them And he said unto them know ye not this parable and how then will you know all parables The sower soweth c" Mark iv  iv wherefore it is our duty to ask God's assistance  when we read the scriptures that we may under∣stand them to our comfort lest they should be a stumbling block to us as they were to the un∣believing Jews But not only the scriptures even Christ himself became a stone of stumbling to the Jews For about the time of his coming they universally expected a glorious and triumphant Messiah to rule over them insomuch that Herod the Great was exceedingly alarmed with the appre∣hension of so powerful a competitor  for the throne of David  But when  "the desire of all nations"  see Haggai ii was really come his humble ap∣pearance meekness and disinterested  though in∣teresting  doctrine did not in the least correspond with their worldly imaginations so that  he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not He came unto his own and his own received him not  John i For the Jews did not then consider any more than they do at present that the humility of the Messiah was as expresly foretold by the prophets as his glory  "Who hath believed our report"  says Isaiah in chap liii when he is about to describe the humility afflictions and death of the Messiah  He hath no form nor comeliness and when we  shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him  He is despised and rejected of men  c See the whole chapter  Who can read this oracle and not allow Isaiah to have been what he is sometimes called the Evangelical Prophet Is not this prophecy in every part as applicable to Jesus as is the account given of him by the holy Evangelists Could it have been expressed in stronger or clearer terms if written after the event And yet it was delivered above years before the birth of Jesus  Dr  Gregory Sharpe's d Argument in Defence of Christianity pag      The Jews could not reconcile this unexpected  humility  with that glorious character which they so long looked for and desired viz  a king that should reign and prosper  whom  "the Lord"  Je∣hovah promised by Jeremiah  Behold the days come saith the Lord  Jeho∣vah  that I will raise unto David a righteous branch and  a king shall reign and prosper  and shall execute judg∣ment and justice in the earth In his days  Judah  shall be saved and Israel shall dwell safely and this is his name whereby he shall be called  The Lord Jehovah    our righteousness  Jeremiah xxiii See also xxxiii where the same title  is given to the Branch of righteousness mentioned in the preceding verseCompare with these chap xxx  And they shall serve the  Lord their God    and  David their king      whom I will raise up unto them  The comparing of these texts together has occasioned the following remark which I find wrote with a pencil in the margin of my Hebrew Bible I suppose by some former owner of it  Messias vocabitur David secun∣dum carnem  Jova  secundum divinitatem  ie  Christ shall be called  David  with respect to his human nature and  Jehovah  with respect to his divinity  The divinity of the Messiah may be clearly proved by a multitude of other pas∣sages even in the Old Testament Therefore it behoves  the authors of the Critical Review  seriously to consider how those men can be justified who refuse the Son of God the honour due unto his name since  the Father hath com∣mitted all judgment unto the Son that all men should honour the Son even as they honour the Father  John v  A doctrine very opposite to this is approved and com∣mended in the th article of the  Critical Review for May  whereby it appears that the author or authors of that recommendatory criticism were not sufficiently armed against the dangerous and pernicious doctrines of the book which they undertook to recommend viz  The Trinitarian Controversy reviewed or a Defence of the Appeal to the common Sense of all Christian People  to  raise up unto  David  and who is likewise called as a name the most suitable to the only begotten Son of God  "the Lord"  Jehovah  "our righteousness"  This unfortunate misapprehension was plainly foretold by Isaiah when he warned the people to  "sanctify the "Lord of hosts himself    and says he  let him be your fear and let him be your dread  Now what person could the prophet mean by this glorious title  Jehovah Sabaoth  if not the Messiah for he im∣mediately adds  and he shall be for a sanctuary  but  or rather  and  for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence to both the houses of Israel for a  gin  and for a  snare  to the inhabitants of Jerusalem And many among them shall  stumble and fall  and  be broken  and  be snared  and  be taken  Bind up the  testimony  seal the law  among my disciples  Isaiah viii  We have the testimony of St Paul in his Epistle to the Romans ix    for they  stumbled  at that  stumbling stone  as it is written Behold I lay in Sion a  stumbling stone  and  rock of offence  and whosoever believeth on  him shall not be ashamed  Rom ix  that this text  re∣lates to Christ  for he has there blended a part of it with another quotation from Isaiah xxviii  Therefore thus saith the Lord God Behold I lay in Zion for a foundation a  stone  a  tried stone  a precious  corner stone  a sure foundation he that believeth shall not  make haste    that is he shall not be sub∣ject to that kind  of haste  which is commonly the effect  of fear  Therefore the Syriac version has rendered it  shall not be afraid  which is very expressive of the Prophet's meaning The LXX have rendered it  and St Paul  that is  shall not be ashamed  which is still more expressive of a man's being free from that  haste  or confusion caused by fear  Not to be ashamed  is frequently put for  not to fear  They shall  not be ashamed  in the  evil time  says the Psalmist xxxvii and againthey shall  not be ashamed  but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate Psalm cxxvii  This I hope is sufficient to reconcile the seeming disagree∣ment between the original and St Paul's quotation  St Peter likewise quotes it in his st Epistle ii  And a  stone of stumbling and a rock of offence  even to them which  stumble  at the word being disobedient whereunto also they were appointed  and applies it to Christ And indeed it can mean no other than  "Christ crucified"  who as St Paul informs us was  to the Jews  a stumbling block  and unto the Greeks foolishness  Cor i But notwith∣standing these plain testimonies Dr Wms is of a very different opinion  Isaiah does not seem  says the Dr in a note p  to speak of the Messiah till the ixth chapter  But though the Dr here allows that the ixth chapter contains a prophecy concerning the Messiah yet perhaps he is not aware that if his reasons against the com∣mon interpretation of the viith chapter on account of  "the present order and abrupt transition"  which he complains of in p  were at all conclusive  the same would hold good likewise against the com∣mon interpretation of this ixth chapter wherein the  transitions  from one subject to another are equally  abrupt  and the remote events concerning the  birth  and  preaching  of the Messiah are foretold even before other events  which were immediately or very shortly to happen  See p  The Dr may be right enough in his observation that there are no instances  of  remote signs  to prove the accomplishment of an event near at hand  See pages and But it is plainly his own mistake which causes the difficulty that he  speaks of for the sign given by Isaiah of the birth of  Immanuel  viz behold a virgin shall conceive c was not a remote sign of  an event near at hand  as the Dr supposes but a  remote sign  of  a remote event  and therefore not liable to his censure  The holy scriptures afford a great many other examples of prophecies which are blended and interwoven with very different subjects different I say both with respect to the matter and the time of accomplishment  There are also many instances of passages which bear a double construction being partly applicable to some particular person expresly mentioned though they ultimately and chiefly relate to another very different person  The prophecy of Nathan concerning Solomon is of this kind  He shall build an house for my name and I will establish the throne of his kingdom for ever I will be his father and he shall be my son  Sam vii King David himself ex∣plained this more particularly to his son Solomon and applied it to him Chron xxii saying "for his name shall be  Solomon  see the margin  "peaceable"  agreeable to Christ's title men∣tioned in the ixth chap of Isaiah viz  prince of  peace    and I will give  peace  and  quietness  unto Israel in his days He shall build an house for my name and he shall be  my son  and I will be  his father  and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel  for ever  But where has  the throne of Solomon been established for near years last past if not in  Jesus Christ  the spiritual  Solomon  and  prince of peace  For though this prophecy plainly related to Solomon yet it referred to a further acomplishment in the Messiah by whom alone it could be perfectly fulfilled and therefore a part of it is applied immediately to Christ by St Paul in his Epistle to the Hebrews i  I will be to him a  father  and he shall be to me a  son  Of the same kind is the lxxiid psalm dedicated to  Solomon  They shall fear  thee  as long as  the sun and moon endure throughout all generations  This is indeed applied to  Solomon  but as the reign of that monarch was merely  temporal  the prophecy cannot be said to be fulfilled in any other person besides the Messiah himself the true  Solomon who  reigns  according to the Psalmist's expression  "throughout all generations"  The prophet Haggai chap ii promises  Zerub∣babel governor of Judah  and  Joshua the high priest  in the name of  the Lord of hosts  that  the desire of all nations shall come  and that he the Lord of hosts  will fill this house  that is the house which they were ordered to build with glory  v And he adds in the th verse  The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former saith the Lord of hosts and in this place will I give  peace    saith the Lord of hosts  Nevertheless in the former part of the same chapter the prophet appeals to those who had seen the  house in her first glory and how says he do you see it now Is it not in your eyes in comparison of it as nothing  v Thus it is plain that the glory of the second house did not consist either in the grandeur of the building laid out by Zerubbabel and Joshua or in the presence of those great and holy men notwithstanding that the prophecy is addressed to them both and that Zerubbabel is spoken to by God in a very re∣markable manner at the conclusion of the same chapter viz  I will take thee  O Zerubbabel my servant  the son of Shealtiel saith the Lord and will make  thee as a signet for I have chosen thee  saith the Lord of hosts  But the glory was manifestly to consist in the "  future coming  c  of the desire of all nations  " For as the promise was made to Zerubbabel and Joshua themselves the prophecy must necessarily be understood to have a more distant accomplishment which indeed the beginning of the sentence sufficiently proves viz  Yet once it is a little while  and  I will shake the heavens  c Haggai ii  The prophet Zachariah likewise promises great things to Zerubbabel and Joshua which he ap∣plies personally to them as builders of the temple  though the same relate ultimately to Christ See chap iv  See also chap vi wherein Joshua by his name  which the LXX render  Jesus  signifying a Saviour as well as by his office and dignity of high priest was plainly set forth as a type of the future Messiah  The prophet orders him to be crowned and saluted with the prophetical title of Christ viz  the branch  of whom he foretold that he should  grow up out of his place  and  build the temple of the Lord  Joshua might indeed be said to build the temple as well as Zerubbabel but he could only be a type of the branch there promised because the real branch was yet to grow up out of his place  "And speak unto him  Joshua  saying Thus speak∣eth the Lord of hosts saying Behold the man whose name is the  branch  and  he shall grow up out of his place  and he shall build the temple of the Lord c" Zech vi    The crowns were given  for a memorial in the temple of the Lord  not of the accomplishment of this prophecy in the person of Joshua but  for a memorial  of what  should afterwards  come to pass  if the people would diligently obey the voice of the Lord their God  "And the crowns shall be to Helem and to Tobijah c  for a memorial  in the temple of the Lord And they that are far off shall come and build in the temple of the Lord and ye shall know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me unto you And this  shall come to pass      if ye will diligently obey the voice of the Lord your God  " Zech vi  Thus we find that  Solomon  Zerubbabel  and  Joshua  as builders of the temple were types of the Messiah the  true builder  of the  everlasting  TEMPLE OF GOD I mean the HOLY CATHOLICK CHURCH  properly  The church of Rome is very  improperly  called the  Catholick Church  because she causes a contradiction in terms by usurping that  general  title to herself alone when at the same time she scarcely seems intitled to be esteemed a part of it For notwithstanding that many worthy mem∣bers of Christ's Catholick Church may have submitted to her communion for want of better information serving God by the sincerity of their intentions yet  what agreement hath the temple of God with idols  Corinth vi Wherefore  "come out of her"  ye people of God  that ye be not partakers  of her sins and that ye receive not of her plagues  Rev xviii She hath perverted the  law of God  like the Scribes and Pharisees of old by her  traditions    forbidding to  marry  and  commanding to abstain from meats  which God hath created to be re∣ceived  with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth  which St Paul Tim iv expresly called  doctrines of devils  She hath defiled the  Catholick Temple  of God by building upon the true foundation  "wood hay stubble"  viz infallibility purgatory osten∣tatious penance mercenary pardons and indulgencies in∣vocation of saints exorcisms

such  abominable things  c c These are no part of  the foundation  mentioned above of the  Apostles and Prophets  whose writings warrant no such  idolatry exorcisms  or  enchantments  and therefore even the  Holy Scriptures themselves  are prohibited in the Popish  Index Expurgatorius  This last is indeed a precaution necessary to the existence of such doctrines for if the poor deluded people were permitted to read the Scriptures they would soon be informed that there is but  One Mediator  between God and man the  Man Christ Jesus  Tim ii and that  there is  none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved  Acts iv O that those men who invoke the  mediation of all saints and angels  notwithstanding the plain doctrine of St  Peter  quoted above would consider what a gross affront by  this execrable service  they offer to Christ who alone is the  way  and the  truth  and the  life  for their daily prayers witness against them that they do not esteem the  mediation of Christ  sufficient for them otherwise they would not like the ido∣latrous Israelites of old invoke  "all the host of heaven"  Kings xvii The  Church of Rome  has endeavoured to cloak this abominable worship with the subtle distinctions of  Latria  and  Dulia  but the necessity of such sophistical arguments proves the reality of that church's backsliding to idolatry  Heathen Rome  was not more guilty of this crime nor hath shed more innocent  blood  in defence of  such abo∣minations  under the old Pagan Emperors than the present Church of Rome has done since her  Bishops  have

iii John ii Luke xx Acts iv Psalm cxviii Isaiah xxviii  It would make a large volume if I were to col∣lect all the prophecies which absolutely relate to two different and distinct subjects in the type and antitype Nevertheless I am particularly obliged to take notice of two more of this kind because Dr Wms has quoted them in favour of his hy∣pothesis notwithstanding that upon examination they will be found to make much against it He says in p  it is  not possible indeed  to  reconcile Matthew  ii and perhaps some other passages in his gospel with  any particular pro∣phecy now extant  in the Old Testament  As to the th verse wherein St Matthew quotes the Prophet Hosea xi  out of Egypt have I called my son  the Dr observes that  the passage in Hosea where these words are found  is not a pro∣phecy of a future event  but a declaration of an event long past and therefore  could not be ful∣filled  when the child JESUS came out of Egypt  Now in one respect the Dr is right viz that the passage with regard to the people of Israel  is a declaration of an event long past  nevertheless he has not assigned any reason why the same passage may not  likewise  contain a prophecy  of a future event  by being intended like many other prophe∣cies to bear a double application  Erasmus has assigned a reason for the error of Julian the apostate concerning this text viz  that he has too much followed the septuagint edi∣tion  nimirum secutus editionem septuaginta  says he  qui locum hunc transtulerunt in hunc mo∣dum quia  parvulus  Israel et ego dilexi  eum  et ex Aegypta vocavi  filics ejus  Annot in Mat∣thaeum p  A misunderstanding of this text is very ex∣cuseable likewise in the authors of that Greek version who could not easily comprehend  before the event  that the Messiah should be called out of Egypt as the children of Israel had been before him and therefore they rendered the passage in such a manner as they thought would best point out the application of it to the people of Israel  only    and out of Egypt have I called  his children  But if the  prophet himself  had intended the same thing  and that only  he would most likely have made use of terms more expressive of  a nation  or  people  than of  a single person  from Egypt have I called my son  and then the Greek inter∣preters would not have been obliged to leave the literal sense of the original in order to adopt it with propriety to  the people of Israel  which proves that some  single person  is more particularly pointed at by the prophet than  the people  of Israel  There are indeed many passages of Scripture wherein nations are represented by single persons  Ezekiel warned the  two houses  of  Israel  under the figure of two adulterous women Aholah and Aho∣libah c But the text in question is very different from many others of that kind for the  people  of Israel are not only represented therein under the figure of a  single person  but some eminent single person is likewise plainly represented at the same time under the  name  and  figure  of the  people of Israel  of which the particularity of the stile affords evident testimony  when Israel was  a little child  and I loved  him  and out of Egypt have I  called my Son  But the following part of the text where∣in Israel could not be a type of the Messiah I mean their forsaking God's commandments and sacri∣ficing to Baal is immediately expressed in  the plural number  as being applicable to the children of Israel  only  and not to Christ  as  they  called  them so they  went  from them they  sacrificed unto Baalim and burnt incense to graven images  Hosea xi Thus it is plain that the text is ap∣plicable in the first place to  the children of Israel  who were brought by God out of Egypt when  they first began  to be esteemed a nation and there∣fore might as a type of Christ be likened to  a little child  being  young and weak  in comparison of  their future state and power  And dly It is un∣doubtedly very applicable to the  single person  of the  Messiah who was  also called by God out of Egypt  when he was  really a little child  Before he could know to refuse the evil and chuse the good  the land being then forsaken of  both her kings  ac∣cording to Isaiah's prophecy vii For the angel's message or call of Christ out of Egypt was delivered to Joseph upon the death of king Herod the Great at which time  precisely  the last of  the two monarchies  was dissolved  according to the plain literal meaning of the passage referred to by St Matthew who quoted the  sense of the Hebrew text  and not that of the Septuagint version  The  child  mentioned by Hosea as  having been called  The prophecy was indeed delivered in the  perfect tense  as a thing already past but this did not prevent the application of it to the  future Messiah  because the  perfect tense  is almost as frequently used by the prophets in de∣claring  futurity  even as the  future  itself  out of Egypt is indeed expresly named  Israel  but this is so far from setting aside the ap∣plication to Christ that on the contrary it affords the strongest confirmation of it for this name was necessarily given in the prophecy that the appli∣cation might be double viz first to the people of Israel and lastly to the Messiah  The Messiah is expresly called  Israel  by Isaiah xlix in a prophecy which cannot  at all be  ap∣plied to the  people of Israel  like the former but must relate  entirely  to Christ viz  Thou art my servant O Israel  in whom I will be glorified  xlix  Indeed the true sense and application of this pas∣sage does not appear without the context never∣theless I am not sorry for the necessity of a long quotation from this chapter because it will convey a very clear and distinct idea of the birth and office of the Messiah at the same time that it proves the point in question  "Listen O isles unto me and hearken ye people from far the Lord hath called me  from the womb    the angel of the Lord appeared unto him Joseph in a dream saying Joseph  thou son of David  fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife for that which is con∣ceived in her is of the Holy Ghost And she shall bring forth a Son and thou shalt call his name  Jesus    a Saviour    for he  shall save his  people from their sins  Matt i  from the  bowels of my mother  hath he made mention of  my name    and behold said the angel thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a Son and shalt call his name  Jesus  Luke i  And he hath made my  mouth like a sharp sword    he shall smite the earth with the  rod of his mouth  and with the breath of  his lips  he shall  stay  the wicked  Isaiah xi See the context also  in the shadow of his hand hath he hid me and made me a  polished shaft  in his quiver hath he hid me and said unto  me Thou art  my servant  O Israel  in whom I will be  glorified  Then I  said I  have laboured in vain  I  have spent  my  strength for nought and in vain yet surely  my  judgment is with the Lord and  my  work with  my  God And now saith the Lord that formed  me  from the womb to be his  servant  to bring  Jacob  again to him though  Israel  be  not gathered  " here is a plain prophecy that  blindness in part should happen to Israel  "yet shall  I  be glorious in the eyes of the Lord and  my  God shall be my strength And  he  said it is a  light thing  that  thou  shouldest be  my servant  to raise up  the tribes of Jacob  and to restore the preserved  of Israel  I will also give  thee  for a  light to the Gentiles  I the Lord have called thee in righteousness and will hold thine hand and will keep thee and give thee for a  covenant of the people  for a  light of the Gentiles  to open  the blind eyes  c Isaiah xlii  A light  to lighten the Gentiles  and the glory of thy people Israel  Luke ii  that thou mayest be  my salva∣tion  unto the end of the earth" "Thus saith the Lord the Redeemer of Israel and  his Holy One  to him whom  man despiseth  He is  despised  and  rejected of men  a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was  despised  and we esteemed him  not  Surely he hath borne our griefs  c Isaiah liii  to him whom the nation abhorreth to a servant of rulers" cThus far may perhaps be sufficient to shew the nature and design of the prophecy Isaiah has introduced the important subject as the narrative of a dialogue  between two distinct persons who are both men∣tioned in this last the th verse viz "the Lord  the Redeemer of Israel" and  his  Holy One    whom man  despiseth  and who is also called  Israel  in the former part of this chapter Now it is remarkable that the people of  Israel  or tribes of  Jacob  are likewise distinctly mentioned in the same prophecy so that the person to whom the Lord said  "Thou art my servant O Israel"  see d verse cannot mean any other person besides the Messiah himself he alone being the true  light to lighten the Gentiles  and  the glory of his people  ISRAEL  For though the  Jewish Religion  was for many ages the only true religion yet the  Gentiles  were not induced universally to acknowledge the truth of the Holy Scriptures by becoming proselytes to  Judaism  but by being  converts to Christ  by whom alone they have been  enlightened  according to the Scriptures If all these things be considered they will I doubt not afford sufficient proof that the text quoted by St Matthew from Hosea xi though introduced in a context absolutely relating to the  people of Israel  was nevertheless propheti∣cally intended to be applied likewise to some  single person  and that the same was eminently fulfilled in the person of  Jesus Christ  the only begotten  Son  of God whom the Father  called out of Egypt  by his angel Jacob and the children of  Israel  may indeed be called the  Sons of  God but it must be in  a very different sense from the former for they are only  types  of the true  Israel    the  Prince  of God who gave this name to Jacob when he wrestled with him that he might render him more conspicuously a type of himself viz as one that had  power with God and with men and had pre∣vailed  Jacob was sensible of the  Divine presence  and therefore called the name of the place  Peniel    or as it is expressed in the margin  the face of God  for said he  I have  seen God face to face and my life is preserved  Gen xxxii  I have already said so much concerning the nature of prophecy in general and have quoted so many examples of two different subjects being referred to by one and the same prophetical expression that I hope I need not any longer urge the reasonable∣ness of a double application likewise of the text quoted by St Matthew from the Prophet Hosea especially as Dr Wms has not assigned any one reason why it ought to be otherwise nor any authority whatsoever for his assertion in page that the passage  "could not be fulfilled when the child Jesus came out of Egypt"  except indeed the autho∣rity of his own bare word which nevertheless seems to have had sufficient weight with the Critical Reviewers though it is opposed to the  express testi∣mony  even of  an Evangelist  The other quotation of St Matthew which Dr Wms has called in question is given in the  d chapter d verse viz  He shall be called a Nazarene  This is one of the texts concerning which the Dr affirms in page that  "it is not possible to reconcile"  it  with any particular prophecy now extant in the Old Testament  But he is greatly mistaken in this for the text may certainly be reconciled not only with one prophecy but with many very  particular prophecies  now  extant in the Old Testament  and therefore St Matthew ap∣peals with  great propriety in this case  not to one prophet alone but to the  sense of all the prophets in general  viz  that "which was  spoken by the prophets  "  For though the prophets do not say expresly that  "he shall be called a Nazarene"  yet many of them do plainly allude to this appellation Our Lord was called a  Nazarene  notwithstanding that he was born at Bethlehem the city of David according to the Scriptures  But thou Bethlehem Ephratah though thou be little among the thousands of Judah yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is  to be ruler in Israel  whose goings forth have been from of old from everlasting  Micah v Compare this with Matt ii and John vii  He was sometimes called  Mark x Luke xviii xxiv John xviii xix and seven times in Acts  and sometimes  Mark i xiv xvi and Luke iv  synony∣mous  terms for a  Nazarene  or inhabitant of  Naza∣reth  which as Dr Hammond expounds it sig∣nifies  The City of the Branch  or where the Messiah  the Branch  should be brought up an  accord∣ingly says the Dr this becomes Christ's vulgar title  "  " c  Now the Messiah is called  the Branch  by Isaiah iv Jeremiah xxiii and Zechariah iii  A plant or branch is the usual scriptureemblem for a child  Thy children  like  olive branches  round about thy table  says the Psalmist in the cxxviiith Psalm d verse and in Psalm cxliv we read  that  our sons  may  grow up  as the  young plants  Therefore the prophets very fitly expressed the  childhood  and  growth  of the Messiah by the word  beforementioned for it properly signifies not only a  Branch  but  Germen  a  bud  or young twig which Isaiah further explains in the liiid chap d verse by the word  a  tender plant  or  sucker  which is not only a fit emblem of the once  infant state  of the Messiah but also of his  gradual increase  in strength and wisdom for  he shall  grow up  before him says the prophet as a  tender plant  and as a  root  out of a dry ground  by which he assigns the true reason of Christ's being called the  Branch  Indeed this whole chapter con∣tains so perfect a description of Christ's human state upon earth that no miracle or demonstration what∣soever can be more capable of affording conviction  and consequently those who have read it and still disbelieve are inexcuseable The prophet Zecha∣riah vi speaks of the  growth  of Christ  the Branch  in the same kind of terms  "He shall  grow up  out of his place"  or as it is properly rendered in the margin  he shall  branch up  from under him  Moreover this prophet foretold in the same verse that he should be named the  Branch    "Behold the man  Zechariah commanded that this prophecy should be spoken to Joshua or Jesus the highpriest in the time of Zerubbabel but I have already shewn that he was therein only a type of our Lord Jesus the true  branch  whose  name  is the  Branch  " plainly alluding by the sense though not the sound of this appellation to Christ's being surnamed  secessit Joseph in partes Galilaeaeibique habitavit in urbe  Nazareth  unde et Christus  Nazareni cognomentum  accepit Matt ii et  Nazarenorum  Christiani Acts xxiv  J Usserii Annalium Pars poste∣rior p    the  Nazarene  from  Nazareth  the city  of the Branch  But Isaiah in the xith chap st verse not only alludes to the sense and meaning of this surname but to the very sound of it for he intitles him  Netser  a  Branch  Now Christ was really called in the common Syriac dialect  Netseria  a  Netserian  or  Nazarene  from  Netsereth  called  from the Greek  Nazareth  where he had been brought up Luke iv and where according to the true meaning of the appellation  Netserian  or  Nazarene  when interpreted he  grew up  as  a plant  or  branch  for St Luke informs us ii that  they  viz Joseph and Mary with the  young child returned  into Galilee to their own city  Nazareth  and the  child grew  and  waxed strong  in spirit filled with wisdom and the grace of God was upon him  And again in the d verse  Jesus increased  in wisdom and  stature  and in favour with God and man  This exactly corresponds with Jere∣miah's prophecy xxxiii viz  In those days and at that time  will I cause the  Branch  of righteousness to  grow up  unto David  If all this be considered I think the fitness of St Matthew's appeal to the prophets concerning the word  cannot be called in question unless like the  Critical Reviewers  fol we should believe from Dr Wms's  bare word  that  signifies a  Nazorite  which interpretation would indeed render it impossible  to reconcile Matthew  ii  with any particular prophecy  now extant in the Old Testament  according to the Doctor's assertion in page  For the Dr informs us in the following page that  "the word is not    a Nazarene but    a Nazorite"  nevertheless it is certain  that both these words signify the  same thing  viz  a Nazarene  or inhabitant of  Nazareth  and like∣wise that neither of them can signify a  Nazarite  or as he spells it  Nazorite  For the Hebrew word  separatus  from whence these last  Nazarite  or  Nazorite  are derived is no where in Scripture rendered  or  but is distinguished from them by an  iota  in the second syllable viz    a Nazarite  Judges xiii and    Nazarites  Lamentations iv Besides it is very plain throughout the whole New Testament that Christ was not called  as being a  Nazarite  for he could not properly be called so according to the law of Moses though John the Baptist was really such but on account of his having been brought up at the city of Nazareth which in the Syriac tongue was called  not with  or  as  Nezereth  but with  or    Netsereth  for the word is plainly derived from  a branch  the name which the prophet Isaiah has given to the Messiah himself as is before observed and there∣fore St Matthew's appeal to the prophets in this case is very easily  reconciled  with the prophecies  "now extant in the Old Testament"  though the Dr has declared that the same  "is not possible"  Even Christ himself condescended sometimes to prophesy in the same kind of style that had before been used by his servants the prophets  Verily I say unto you there be some standing here  which shall  not taste of death  till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom  Matth xvi And again  If I will that he John  tarry till I come  what is that to thee  John xxi Here our Lord makes use of  the same words and phrases  with which he was wont to express his  second coming to judge  the world so that his disciples understood that John should not die whereas the event plainly shewed that he  meant of his  coming  so often mentioned in the New Testament  in judgment upon the Jews at the final overthrow of Jerusalem which St John outlived many years  See Dr  Cave on the Life of that Disciple  Antiquitates Apostolicae p  Our Lord likewise  used the same words and phrases  unto these  two different subjects  viz his  coming  in judgment upon Jerusalem and his last  coming  to judge the world  when occasion was to speak of them together  according to the obser∣vation before quoted from Assemblies Annotations insomuch that the  day of judgment  and the  end of the world  were expected to follow immediately after the accomplishment of Christ's prophecies in the xxivth chap of Matthew xiiith of Mark and xxist of Luke concerning  God's judgment in the destruction  of  Jerusalem  The latter however may indeed be considered as a sign or type of the  great and last day  and the accomplishment of the prophecies concerning it is undoubtedly a sure pledge of  God's future  judgment  just in the same manner as the  temporary deliverance  from Rezin and Pekah promised to Ahaz and the house of David by Isaiah was properly the con∣firmation and pledge of the future distant deliverance promised in the person of  Immanuel  Therefore if Dr Wms supposes as he hints in the words of Mr Collins in page that this sign stood in need of other signs to manifest that God would perform it in time let him consider the context once more and he will find that the sign was not without such a manifestation as Mr Collins and himself have required Perhaps it may be said that I have troubled my readers with a great many more ex∣amples of  "types figures and secondary senses"  than were necessary for the point in question but I was induced thereto by the too hasty censure passed on these sort of writings by the authors of the  Critical Review  in page where they seem to condemn all  types  c whatsoever indiscriminately without deigning to distinguish the difference between  pro∣per types  and  imaginary  ones  The  END  of  PART II  A DISSERTATION ON ISAIAH vii  A DISSERTATION ON ISAIAH vii    Within threescore and five years  shall Ephraim be broken that it be not a people  THE accomplishment of Isaiah's prophecy in confirmation of which he required Ahaz to ask a sign was not  an event near at hand  as Dr Wms supposes for no less a term than sixtyfive years was allowed for the accomplishment of one of the circumstances con∣tained in it viz  within threescore and five years  shall Ephraim be broken that it be not a people  Isaiah vii  Nevertheless the king or regal government of Ephraim or Israel for Ephraim in this text seems to be put for the ten tribes of Israel as separated  from Judah lasted no longer than about twentyone years after the prophecy was delivered for  "in the ninth year of Hoshea"  the sixth of Heze∣kiah  the king of Assyria took Samaria and car∣ried Israel away into Assyria  Kings xvii therefore commentators have generally found it very difficult to account for the number of  sixtyfive years  mentioned in this prophecy  A very learned and justly esteemed author  Bishop Newton on the Prophecies  in order to solve the difficulty has applied several texts in the second book of Kings to an imaginary cap∣tivity or carrying away by Esarhaddon which if the context be carefully considered will be found to relate undoubtedly to the  real  captivity under Salmanasser We understand indeed from Ezra iv that the adversaries of Benjamin and Judah the Samaritans dated the time of their settlement in the cities of Samaria from  the days of Esar∣haddon king of Assur which  as they said  brought us up hither  But there is no necessity to suppose that Esarhaddon carried any people away into captivity from thence nor any evidence to support such a supposition Was it not possible for Esarhaddon to plant fresh colonies in the land of Israel where it was too thinly inhabited by the former colonies without having carried away any of the inhabitants into captivity Surely it was not  only possible but most probable that this was really the case notwithstanding that several other learned men besides Bp Newton have thought otherwise and particularly Fr Junius quoted by Dr Simson in his Chronicon Catholicum pars tia p But the Doctor himself sufficiently accounts for the passages in Ezra ch iv and so that there is no necessity to suppose another captivity un∣der Esarhaddon  Quanquam enim Salmanasar illam coloniam primus deduxerit tamen cum plu∣rimi incolarum à feris fortè pestilentiâ sic enim ait Josephus libro nono extincti essent pos∣tea plures ab Asarhaddone illuc missos fuisse  veri∣simile est  And he likewise quotes Nicholaus Bra∣bantinus to the same purpose  Leones enim vastaverunt magnam partem populi quem Salma∣nassar miserat propter quod iste Asarhaddon mi∣sit alios loco ipsorum cum iis unum de sacerdo∣tibus captivis qui doceret eos colere Dominum  The prophet does not say that  Ephraim shall be broken from a kingdom in sixtyfive years  but that within such a time he shall be  broken from a people  therefore it is plain that the prophecy could not be accomplished by the captivity of Ephraim and the destruction of the  regal government  of Samaria by Salmanassar because Ephraim or the children of Israel might be still called  a people  or nation even after their removal into a strange country for they could not be said to  "be broken from a people"  until the judgments denounced against them by the prophet Amos ix should be fulfilled viz  Though they go into captivity before their ene∣mies thence will I command the sword and it shall slay them  It appears from the history of Tobit that this really came to pass for he speaks of the frequent slaughter made of  the people  of  his nation  by Sen∣nacherib chap i  for in his wrath he slew many  And even in the reign of Esarhad∣don about  sixtyfive years  after Isaiah's prophecy notwithstanding that Achiarcharus Tobit's nephew was appointed over all the king's affairs st verse we find an instance recorded of the continuation of this persecution  For when Tobit was told chap ii that one of his nation was strangled and cast out in the marketplace he remembered th verse  that prophecy of Amos  as he said see Amos viii Your feasts shall be turned into mourning and all your mirth into lamentation  for it was then the  feast of pentecost  or seven weeks and Tobit had sent out to invite such of his poor brethren as feared the Lord that they  might partake of the "good dinner  which was  prepared  " but in the mean time he received this melancholy account see st d and d verses which proves the pro∣priety of his quotation from Amos The same chapter of Amos contains a passage very suitable to my purpose viii  The end is come upon my people of Israel  I will not again pass by them any more And the songs of the temple shall be howlings in that day  see th verse quoted by Tobit  and all your songs into lamentation  saith the Lord God there  shall be many dead bodies  in every place  they shall cast them forth with silence  I am sensible that the apocryphal book of Tobit ought not to be considered of sufficient authority for the proof of any thing yet I hope that the remarkable corre∣spondence it bears to the subject in question will excuse my quotation  Moses also prophesied that the captives of Is∣rael should be persecuted  I will scatter you among the heathen and will draw out a sword after you  Levit xxvi  So we need not doubt but that by this and other such heavy judgments of God the captives of the ten tribes of Israel would be so much reduced in number within the  term of threescore and five years  mentioned by Isaiah that Ephraim might well be said to  be broken from a people  for we read in Deut xxviii  Also every sickness and every plague which is not written in the book of this law them will the Lord bring upon thee until thou be destroyed And ye shall  be left few in number  which agrees well with the expression of Isaiah concerning Ephraim's being  broken that it be not a people  viz being now left  few in  number    whereas ye were as the stars of heaven for multitude  The completion of Isaiah's prophecy concerning Ephraim is very apparent even in another way for though some of Ephraim and of all the other tribes were afterwards settled in Judaea and other places though we read of  a remnant of Israel  see Chron xxxiv that contributed to the repair∣ing of the temple in the reign of Josiah king of Judah long after the completion of  the sixtyfive years  limited by Isaiah and though Manasseh and Ephraim are expresly mentioned on the same occa∣sion nevertheless this remnant of Ephraim or Is∣rael could have no pretensions as before to be esteemed a separate people or nation from Judah because they were once more become subject to the laws and regal government of  the tribe of Judah  of which the authority exercised among them by Josiah is a sufficient proof and therefore notwith∣standing that on some particular occasions they were distinguished by their tribes yet as a body or nation they were generally afterwards esteemed a  part of the tribe of Judah  which accounts for the expression of the historian Kings xvii  "There was none left but the tribe of Judah only"  that is there was none left but part of the tribes of Levi Benjamin and such individuals of the other tribes as lived in or might have escaped into the inheritance of Judah and consequently were  all considered as the proper subjects of  the kingdom of Judah  and have ever since borne  the name of that tribe  viz  Jews  Thus the title of  Jews  became general about this time to all the other tribes as well as Judah for the kingdom  of Israel  was never afterwards restored in a separate state from Judah and therefore after the captivity by Salmanassar  the land which Ahaz vexed  might be said to  "be forsaken of"  one of  "her kings"  "For before the child shall know to refuse the evil and choose the good the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of BOTH HER KINGS" Isaiah vii  or regal governments  But the succession of the kings of Judah con∣tinued regularly until the Babylonish captivity and on account of this interruption or of others after∣wards the land could not be said to be  forsaken of both her kings  if the regal government was to be afterwards restored for any considerable length of time and we find  that many kings reigned in Judah  after that period I have already observed that when  Ephraim  was  broken from a people  the natio∣nal name of  Jews  became general to all the other tribes as well as Judah but it is likewise remark∣able that about the same time the whole Jewish nation including Judah and Benjamin as descend∣ants of Jacob began once more to be called  Israel  as they had formerly been before the revolt of the  ten tribes In the second book of Chron xxxv  "And said unto the Levites that taught  all Israel  which were holy unto the Lord Put the holy ark in the house cserve now the Lord your God and  his people Israel  " Chron xxxv  the Levites that taught  all Israel  are exhorted to serve the Lord their God and  his people Israel  meaning the whole nation Isaiah in the fortieth chapter th verse  "Why sayest thou  O Jacob  and speakest  O Israel  my way is hid from the Lord and my judgment is passed over from my God" Isaiah xl "But  thou Israel  art my servant Jacob whom I have chosen the seed of Abraham my friend" Chap xli "Fear not thou  worm Jacob  and ye  men of Israel  " Verse See also chap xliii  and several succeeding chap∣ters speaks of the whole Jewish nation under the title of  Jacob  and  Israel  for tho' he might write these chapters before the change that I speak of yet it must be considered that he is addressing himself to the people in the spirit of prophecy and plainly refers to the latter times Ezekiel iii  "Son of man go get thee unto  the house of Israel  " c Ezek iii  was sent unto the  house of Israel  meaning the Jews that were carried into captivity with Jehoiakim  Get thee to them of the captivity  c see th verse Many of the other prophets expressed them∣selves in the same manner See Zech xii  "The burden of the word of the Lord for  Israel  " c Zech xii  Malachi i  "The burden of the word of the Lord to  Israel  by Malachi" i  Ezra iv c  "But Zerubbabel and Jeshua and the rest of the chief of the  fathers of Israel  " c Ezra iv  So that the na∣tional names of  Israel  and  Jews  were now considered as synonymous terms for  Ephraim  the chief of the ten tribes was now  broken from a people  and there∣fore the name of  Israel  did not generally distin∣guish them as a separate  nation or people  as before though indeed both  Ephraim  and the  two houses of Israel  the house of Judah and the house of Is∣rael were sometimes afterwards on particular oc∣casions distinctly mentioned as in the thirtyfirst  "Behold the days come saith the Lord that I will make a new covenant with  the house of Israel  and with the house  of Judah  " Jerem xxxi  and fiftieth  "In those days and in that time saith the Lord  the children of Israel  shall come they and  the children of Judah  together going and weeping they shall go and seek the Lord their God" Jer l This was plainly ful∣filled after the Babylonish captivity as the following verses testify"Remove  out of the midst of Babylon  " c Verses  chapters of Jeremiah and eighth of Zechariah  Nevertheless  all the nation  were  the children of Israel all were Jews  and in length of time the  remnant of Israel  was so blended with  Judah  that many intirely lost the distinction of their tribes  Ezra ii  "These sought their register among those that were reckoned by genealogy but they were not found" Ezra ii  and more especially after the Baby∣lonish captivity when the prophecy of Ezechiel seems plainly to be fulfilled  Thus saith the Lord God Behold I will take the stick of Joseph  which is in the hand of Ephraim  and the tribes of Israel his fellows and will put them  with him even with the stick of Judah  and make them ONE STICK and they shall be ONE in mine hand  Chap xxxvii And in the d verse  I will make them  one nation  in the land upon the mountains of Israel and  one king  shall be king to them all and they shall be no more  two na∣tions  neither shall they be divided into  two king∣doms  any more at all  Agreeably to this prophecy the children of Israel were  one nation  and under  one king  that is a suc∣cession of kings reigning one by one during the reigns of all the Asmonean princes as well as that of Herod the Great until Shiloh the prince of peace was come according to the prophecy of the patriarch Jacob recorded in Genesis xlix viz  The scepter shall not depart from Judah  nor a lawgiver from between his feet  until Shiloh come  and unto him shall the gathering of the people be  The  END  of  PART III  A DISSERTATION ON GENESIS xlix  The sceptre shall not depart from Judah nor a lawgiver from between his feet until Shiloh come and unto him shall the gathering of the people be  A DISSERTATION ON GENESIS xlix  IN the preceding Dissertation concerning Ephra∣im I have observed that the sceptre was con∣tinued in the inheritance of Judah during the reigns of all the Asmonaean princes  And I believe the Jews themselves will not deny that the said reigns include a part of the continuation of the sceptre in Judah as promised by the patriarch Jacob therefore I presume it will not be necessary for me to examine the Jewish histories further back than the time when the sceptre was translated into the family of Antipater so that I propose to begin this Dissertation where I left off in the last viz with the reign of Herod the Great  Herod had as much right to be esteemed a Jew or of the tribe of Judah  The ingenious Mr Mann in the first section of his th chapter de anno natali Christi endeavours to prove that Herod was really a Jew There are likewise several other parts of that learned book which would both illustrate and confirm many of the points which I have advanced nevertheless as I cannot entirely agree with him in all his opinions and as I had finished my remarks except a short addition at the end of this Dissertation before I had the satisfaction of reading his work I shall therefore content myself with referring my readers to the book itself  as the Asmonaean princes of the tribe of Levi for not only the descendants of the twelve tribes were called Jews after the Baby∣lonish captivity as I have before observed but even the  proselytes of the  Jews though they were by birth  Gentiles  of any other nation whatsoever  This is strongly expressed by Josephus in his account of king Izates the great Adiabenian pro∣selyte See Jewish Antiquities th book  The Orleans edition of Josephus printed in fol which is referred to as often us Josephus is quoted in these remarks    Which is thus ren∣dered by Gelenius  cumque existimaret se non esse  perfectum Judaeum  nisi circumcideretur paratus erat et hoc facere  And again    neque ullo pacto laturos  Judaeum  in regio solio  The Idumaeans  or Edomites  Thou shalt not abhor an  Edomite for he is thy brother  Deut xxiii i eThe patriarch Edom which is Esau see Gen xxv was Jacob's brother  from whom Herod was descended were not only proselytes to the Jewish religion but were still more nearly connected with the Jews by having been governed by the same princes and laws from the time that they were conquered by John Hyrcanus the nephew of Judas Maccabaeus  so that from that time they were accounted Jews  as Josephus testifies Antiq th book th chap fol  And they were afterwards as zealous for the rights and liberties of Jerusalem which they esteemed  their metropolitan city  as the native Jews themselves See Jewish War book iv chap page  Thus it appears that the Idumaeans as a nation had certainly a right to be esteemed  Jews  But king Herod's claim of relationship did not depend upon this single circumstance of his being descended from the Idumaeans His connections with the Jews were far greater than any other Idumaean could ever boast of His father Antipater though an Idumaean was a person of such trust and esteem among the Jews that he held the greatest offices under their kings  He served under their king Alexander  as governor of Idumaea  Antiq book xiv chap p under their king and highpriest Hyrcanus as  governor of Judaea itself and commander in chief of the Jewish army  And afterwards he served under Caesar also as  procurator of Judae    See the xivth and xvth chapters of the same book  Therefore not only as an Idumaean but also by these continual connections as well as residence among the Jews Antipater seemed to be entirely naturalized to this people insomuch that he esteemed their interest as his own their country as though it had been  his native land  His assiduity and diligence in repairing the walls of Jerusalem  book xiv chap when he had obtained leave of Caesar to do so is a proof of this as well as Josephus's manner of expressing that circumstance  Jewish War  book i chap viz  Thus rendered by Rufinus  et praeter hoc Antipater impe∣travit ut subversa  patriae  moenia renovare sibi liceret  And again  Anti∣pater vero ubi de Syria Caesarem prosecutus est in  Judaeam  reversus  ante omnia  PATRIAE  muros  a Pom∣pëio dirutos reparabat  If all these circumstances are considered it will not be easy to prove that the  son  of such a person ought to be accounted a foreigner to the Jews Herod was born a subject of the kingdom of the Jews and publickly professed their religion laws and customs notwithstanding that he frequently offended against them all and if he did not think himself in reality intitled to be esteemed one of that nation he nevertheless omitted no proper oppor∣tunity of claiming relationship A remarkable instance of this we have in his speech to the Jews when he proposed to enlarge and beautify their temple  For said he  our fathers  built this temple to Almighty God after the return from Babylon  c  Jewish Antiq book xv chap p  There are many other instances in Josephus of Herod's expressing himself in this manner and indeed the singular circumstances of this monarch's connections with the Jews rendered his claim of relationship so just that it could not be disputed although he was not descended of any of the twelve tribes Josephus who called Herod's father An∣tipater  an Idumaean  does not deny that he was a Jew but only that he  was not descended from the chief Jews who came into Judaea from Babylon  which had been asserted by Nicholas of Damascus  Antiq book xiv chap p On the con∣trary Josephus informs us that when the Jews of Caesarea contended with the Syrians for the right of superiority in that city they alledged that the founder  Herod their king was a Jew by birth  Antiq Book xx chap p And the justice of this plea so far as it related to Herod  was allowed by the Syrians  c See also Jewish War book ii chap p  c  If all these things be considered I think they must justify my expression that Herod had as much right to be esteemed  a Jew  as the  Asmonaean princes of the tribe of Levi  and though neither the latter nor Herod notwithstanding that  they were Jews  were really descended of the tribe of Judah yet the completion of Jacob's prophecy concerning the sceptre of Judah is not at all affected by this cir∣cumstance  For the said prophecy does not I apprehend so much relate to the descent or genealogy of the in∣dividuals that were to rule in Judah as to the par∣ticular preeminence of that whole tribe from which the sceptre the sign of its being a distinct kingdom  should not depart till Shiloh was come Therefore it is not so very material to my present purpose whether Herod was a Jew or not since it must be acknowledged be his parentage what it will that he was nevertheless  "king of Judaea"  as Luke stiles him chap i verse viz king of the  tribe and inheritance of Judah  as well as of the other tribes incorporated therein and that he kept his royal residence in  the capital city of that ruling tribe  as did all the preceding kings of  Judah  howsoever descended  An objection has been made to the common interpretation of the word  or  sceptre  in Ja∣cob's prophecy viz that  it could not with any sort of propriety be said that  the scepter should not depart from Judah  when Judah had no scepter nor was to have any for many gene∣rations afterwards  See Bishop Newton on the Prophecies Vol i p    But the learned author of this objection has not considered that the sceptre or regal government in Judah is plainly  implied and foretold in the former part of the same prophecy  which entirely removes the force of his argument in favour of a different interpretation of that word  Judah  said the patriarch thou art he whom  thy brethren shall praise  alluding to the meaning of his name  thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies  thy father's children shall bow down before thee  Gen xlix  Now notwithstanding the precedency of the tribe of Judah in the encampments and marching of the Israelites in the wilderness yet this part of the pro∣phecy  thy father's children shall bow down before thee  cannot be said to be fulfilled until all the other tribes became subject to the monarchy of the tribe of Judah under David and Solomon which is observed likewise by the authors of the Commen∣tary on the Bible called Assemblies Annotations "This" say they  was literally most verified in David and Solomon who were of this tribe and spiritually in Christ the  lion of the tribe of Judah  Rev v to whom all knees shall bow  Phil ii And they observe further that  the courage of Judah is compared to a lion's whelp such was the tribe of Judah in the first essays of war in the time of Joshua afterwards it increased to the vigour of a lion at full age and old in comparison of a whelp such it was in David's time and by age and experience subtle as well as strong for David of that tribe was so wise that Saul was afraid of his wisdom Sam xviii and very couragious see Sam xvii from ver to as the lion above other beasts who by his courage and strength  is a king over them  Num xxiii Prov xxviii and xxx Amos iii Mic v  If all this be considered it will appear that  in this text must be translated  a sceptre  which is  the opinion likewise of Mons Martin  Quoique le mot Hebreu signifie aussi une verge qu'il soit employé quelque fois dans un sens meta∣phorique pour la verge des afflictions  la liaison de ce verset avec le precedent toute la matiere contenue dans ce texte  ne permettent pas d'ex∣pliquer ici ce mot autrement que par celui  de sceptre  de même que dans ce passage de Za∣charie chap x où se trouvent en Hebreu les mêmes termes qu'ici le sceptre se departira d'Egypte  Thus it is plain that the  regal sceptre  was not  to depart from the tribe of Judah  till Shiloh was come  Now the Messiah was not born until towards the close of  king Herod's  reign therefore the  sceptre of Judah  could not be said to depart or begin to de∣part  "be departing"  as some commentators have fancied before that period Neither could the  the land which Ahaz vexed  be said to  be forsaken of both her kings  or monarchies whilst Herod continued to reign in Jerusalem But  immediately after his death  the form of government was entirely altered There was no longer  a sceptre  in the tribe or inheritance of Judah The Jews had now no other  worldly king but Caesar  for  the peculiar sceptre of Judah  was departed They were indeed subject  to a sceptre  but it was the  Roman sceptre  which could not on this account be called the  Sceptre of Judah  and therefore it is plain that at this time  the sceptre departed from Judah A solemn lega∣tion of fifty ambassadors from Jerusalem who were backed by eight thousand Jews at Rome sollicited Caesar that their regal government might be changed and that they might be added to the pro∣vince of Syria and become subject to the Roman commanders that should be sent there  See Antiq p See also p where the same thing is strongly expressed  Nevertheless Caesar did not at that time entirely comply with their request for as Archelaus was named by his father Herod to be his successor in the kingdom Caesar was pleased to grant him the half of Herod's dominions but  not as a kingdom  for he allowed him the title only of Ethnarch and as such Archelaus had no more rigth to the  ensign of royalty  spoken of by the patriarch Jacob in the th chapter of Genesis than he had to the  title and dignity of a king  which were  never conferred  on him though promised conditionally  Antiq book xvii chap p From this it appears that an ethnarch did not differ from a king  in title only  "The dignity of a kingdom"  was then merely promised which is a proof that the ethnarchy at that time established was entirely without  such dignity  and Archelaus was so far from obtaining the  promised kingdom  that about nine years after∣wards he  was banished even from his ethnarchy  See Jewish War book ii chap p  c    In the mean time Herod Antipas another son of Herod the Great was tetrarch of Galilee It was this Herod who beheaded John the Baptist in his territory of Galilee and whose crafty base and selfinterested disposition was characterized by the Messiah himself under the simile of  a fox  for in detestation of such  pernicious principles  he even named him from that wily animal  Go and tell  that fox  c To this man was Christ sent by Pontius Pilate not because Herod Antipas had any judicial authority in Jerusalem but because Christ was accounted  a Galilean  and therefore Pilate  sent him as being one that belonged unto  Herod's jurisdiction  See St Luke xxiii    when Pilate heard of  Galilee  he asked whether the man Jesus were  a Galilean  And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto  Herod's jurisdiction  he  sent him to Herod  who himself was also at Jerusalem at that time    Judaea was indeed  spiritually the kingdom of the Messiah  of which many incontestable proofs are inserted throughout this work and compared with the predictions of the prophets but with respect to its temporal or civil government it was so far from  being a kingdom  at this time that it was only considered as a part of the province of Syria and for above thirty years together was governed by a regular succession of Roman procurators  Josephus informs us that Valerius Gratus successor to Annius Rufus was the fifth governor of the Jews and that he was succeeded by Pontius Pilate"  "  Antiq book xviii chap p  until Herod Agrippa obtained Judaea and Samaria in addition to his former dominions of the emperor Claudius who likewise confirmed his  title of king  This at first sight seems a weighty objection to the explanation which I have offered concerning the completion of Jacob's prophecy but if we consider all the circumstances of this reign perhaps it will  appear otherwise Though Agrippa enjoyed the title pomp and appearance of a king he was nevertheless subjected in no small degree as well as his predecessors the Roman procurators to the controul of the Roman president of Syria  Antiq book xviii chap p  c  For when he had undertaken thoroughly to repair and compleat the fortifications of Jerusalem Marsus the president of Syria had a watchful eye over him and signified his distrust to Caesar who caused him to desist Antiq book xix chap p And afterwards Marsus exerted his authority as president in a very remarkable manner even  in the dominions of Agrippa when the king himself was resi∣dent therein  for being jealous of the friendship and unity between Agrippa and several of the neigh∣bouring potentates who were come to visit him at Tiberias  he sent and commanded them all to depart to their respective governments which was a matter of the greatest mortification to Agrippa    Antiq book xix chap p  These are proofs that Agrippa's power as a king was very much circumscribed in comparison with that of Herod the Great Herod was so far from  being subject to the controul of the presidents of Syria that he himself was made president of  all Syria  by Caesar  who directed the several governors to do nothing without his counsel and advice  Jewish War book i chap xv p See also Antiq book xv chap p  On the other hand likewise the reign of Agrippa was so very short in comparison of the time that the sceptre had been departed from Judah that I think it can scarcely be considered as an exception either to the prophecy of Jacob or to this of Isaiah concerning  the two kings  especially as Agrippa was cut off from his kingdom by a very remarkable interposition of Divine Providence for after he had slain St James the brother of St John im∣prisoned St Peter and otherwise grievously per∣secuted the Christians he fulfilled the measure of his iniquity by accepting the idolatrous flattery of the people at Caesarea  and immediately the angel of the Lord smote him because he gave not God the glory and he was eaten up of worms and gave up the ghost  Acts xii having reigned over Judah only  three years  according to Josephus who in the th book of his Antiquities chap p confirms the account given by St Luke though in some particulars his relation is different  c Jewish War book ii chap p  Immediately after  his death his son Agrippa the younger being only an infant the kingdom was reduced again into a province  Cypros  c Jewish War book ii chap p  and never was any more restored for  the government of the Roman procurators  which had been  only interrupted  by this  shadow of a reign  after eight or nine persons had been invested with that dignity was once more established and continued during a regular succession of seven other procurators until the time of the the general revolt of the Jews when the just and dreadful vengeance of God was ready to overtake them for their wickedness and unbelief according to the express prediction of Christ recorded in the Gospels Matt xxiv Mark xiii Luke xxi  Agrippa the younger afterwards obtained the kingdom of Chalcis  Antiq book xx chap p Jewish War book ii chap p chap p  and some other dominions but he never had any authority at Jerusalem except that ecclesiastical authority over the temple and  priests which his uncle and predecessor Herod king of Chalcis had enjoyed before him for all Judaea except two  Abila and Julias  cities in Peraea and two  Tarichaea and Tiberias  in Galilee given to Agrippa were governed by Felix the Roman procurator "  " Jewish War book ii chap p Thus it appears  that Jerusalem  had ceased to be the seat of  regal government  from the time of Herod's death to the total destruction of that city except indeed during the three years reign of Herod Agrippa But it is remarkable that before this short reign the Jews had not only sollicited Caesar by a solemn legation of fifty ambassadors as I have before observed in page that their nation might no longer be governed by kings but their chief priests had likewise publickly abrogated all pretensions that their nation could have  to any peculiar sceptre of  their own for when Pilate brought forth Jesus in the presence of the main body of the people who were assembled at Jeru∣salem on account of the passover and said  Be∣hold your king  and again  Shall I crucify your king  they answeredWe have  no other king but Caesar  St John xix  This publick acknowledgment of the Jews that the  peculiar sceptre of Judah was then no more  the  limited jurisdiction  as well as  brevity  Josephus in some parts of his history expresses a very particular respect if it may not be called a partiality in favour of the character of Agrippa on account of his zealous attachment to Judaism Nevertheless the  limited jurisdic∣tion and brevity of his reign  was such that even Josephus himself did not consider it as a  continuation of the regal government of Judah  for in the th chapter of his th book of Antiquities where he gives a summary account of the government at Jerusalem under which the office of high priest subsisted from the time of Herod the Great to the destruction of Jerusalem he observes that  after the death of Herod and Archelaus the government or police was an aristocracy  and he entirely omits any mention of Agrippa's reign in this place so that 'tis plain he did not think it properly an exception to his observation  Antiq book xx chap p  of Herod Agrippa's reign and the want of  regal succession  for a long time before it and  for ever  after it are reasons which I hope will justify my suggestion that the said reign is not to be considered as a con∣tinuation of the sceptre in Judah and therefore it is most natural to conclude that the same really departed at  the death of Herod the Great  which period corresponds more exactly to the time pointed out by Jacob's prophecy than any other Shiloh  the Prince of Peace  was then come and Herod convinced by  "the wise men from the east"  that a child  was born king of the Jews  had attempted in vain to cut him off at Bethlehem  The general consent of the chief priests and scribes of the Jews concerning the place of the Messiah's birth is very remarkable for when Herod gathered them together  he demanded of them where Christ should be born and they said unto him in Bethlehem of Judaea  for thus it is written by the prophet  And thou Bethlehem in the land of Judah art not the least among the princes of Judah for out of thee shall come a governor that shall rule my people Israel  Mat ii Now though the Jews still deny that our Lord Jesus was the Christ yet they must confess  with their ancestors  that the true Messiah accord∣ing to the prophet Micah v ought to be born at Beth∣lehem It is therefore a matter of the highest importance to them to consider what expectations they can reasonably have nowadays of the birth of a Messiah  of the seed of David  at Bethlehem since that place for so many ages has ceased  to be the city of David  For instead of the family and kindred of David it is now inhabited by  Turks Moors Arabians and some poor Christians  See  Bohun's Geographical Dictionary  printed in And further if any person hereafter born at Bethlehem should pretend to be  the son of David  or of the seed of David the Jews ought to consider whether it is now possible to trace that  royal line  down to the present time in so satisfactory a manner that they might  safely  and  reasonably  give credit to such pretensions  But what is Bethlehem now Where are the thousands of Judah of which this was one What is Jerusalem now Are the tribes preserved Has  Judah  still the sceptre and the lawgiver Where is its ensign displayed And  who can now prove their descent from David  All the signs    Gem Sanhedrin c ii § of the coming of the Mes∣siah "are past" c Dr  Gregory Sharpe's  d  Argument in Defence of Christianity  p O that the  house of Israel  may consider these things before it is too late  for like the  generality of the Jews Herod expected a temporal prince and therefore concluded that his own sceptre and authority was in danger as it really was it being  then about to depart  For very soon after∣wards Joseph the husband of the blessed Virgin was warned by an angel of the Lord in Egypt saying  Arise and take the  young child  and his mother and go into  the land of Israel  not the land of Judah only  for  they are dead which sought the young child's life  Matth ii  Perhaps some critic may object that as Christ was undoubtedly  king of Israel and Judah  the sceptre of Judah cannot be said to depart at the death of Herod according to the interpretation just now given of the patriarch Jacob's prophecy therefore it is necessary for me to observe that the  sceptre  spoken of in this prophecy and the ceasing of the two kings or regal governments spoken of by Isaiah can only be understood to mean the de∣parture of the  worldly sceptre  and  temporal regal authority  from Judah and Israel as necessarily to be  distinguished from the  spiritual authority and hea∣venly kingdom  of Christ for as Christ was  born king of the Jews  so the sceptre of Judah with respect to him is not departed but is everlasting according to the prophecy of the Royal Psalmist concerning Christ's kingdom  Thy throne  O God is for ever and ever the sceptre  of thy king∣dom is  a right sceptre  Thou lovest righteous∣ness and hatest wickedness therefore God even thy God hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows  Psalm xlv  The other part of Jacob's prophecy concerning Judah viz  "nor a lawgiver from between his feet"  does not relate I apprehend to the sceptre or regal government of Judah for the particle  rendered  "nor"  in the common English version which divides these words from the former part of the sentence seems to point out that two distinct things are here spoken of as Mons Martin has observed  Car cette particule  et  marque que c'etoient deux choses different  le sceptre  et le legislateur  But as the accomplishment of prophecies is always the best interpreter I have been chiefly confirmed in this opinion of Mons Martin by observing that the departure of the lawgiver from Judah was not less remarkable in the accomplishment than that of the sceptre for the prophecies concerning both seem plainly to have been accomplished in two different persons  The word  must be understood in a very inferior sense from the usual acceptation if the Jewish Sanhedrin or the Scribes and Pharisees are to be esteemed lawgivers as some have imagined  The Lord himself is called by Isaiah  "our lawgiver"  xxxiii And as it pleased Almighty God to declare his will to his people Israel by Moses and the Prophets they also are intitled to the name of  lawgivers  as being the im∣mediate instruments of God's revelation Judah might likewise be properly called  a lawgiver  Psalms lx cviii because  the Messiah  was to be born of that tribe But the Scribes and Pharisees or the Sanhedrin were not sent by God with any fur∣ther revelation than what had before been given by Moses and the Prophets and therefore though they sat in Moses' seat Matt xxiii yet they could not properly be called lawgivers being only  lawyers or expounders  of the law of Moses and if no person among the Jews for above seventeen hun∣dred years has had a better claim to the title of lawgiver than these it must plainly appear that the lawgiver as well as the sceptre is departed from Judah and consequently that the Messiah came before that time Malachi is the last person whom the Jews acknowledge as a prophet in their canon of the Scriptures and it is remarkable that Al∣mighty God was pleased to comfort them by this holy  messenger    with the promise of another  messenger  or prophet  Behold I will send you  Eli∣jah the prophet  before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord  Mal iv This dreadful visitation of their nation was certainly accomplished  in the destruction of Jerusalem  for if we examine the histories of former times ever so minutely we shall not be able to find any  national afflictions or miseries  whatsoever to be compared with those which the Jews suffered at that time This ought to be a sufficient proof to the Jews of the truth of Christ's prophecy concerning themselves recorded in Mat∣thew xxiv  When ye therefore shall see  the abomination of deso∣lation  spoken of by Daniel the Prophet ix and xii stand in the holy place whoso readeth let him understand then let them which be in Judaea flee unto the mountains    For then shall be  great tribulation  such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time no nor ever shall be And except those days should be shortened there should no flesh be saved but for the elects sake those days shall be shortened  Luke xxi  And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies then know that the desolation thereof is nigh Then let them which are in Judea flee to the moun∣tains and let them which are in the midst of it depart out and let not them that are in the countries enter there∣into For these be the  days of vengeance  that all things which are written Dan ix Zech xi c c may be fulfilled But wo unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days for there shall be great distress in the land and wrath upon  this people  And they shall fall by the edge of the sword and shall be led away captive into all nations and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles  until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled  Luke xxi  For in those days shall be affliction such as was not from the begin∣ning of the creation which God created unto this time neither shall be  Mark xiii  and Mark xiii so that as one part of  the prophecy was so punctually accomplished they may safely assure themselves that such great tribula∣tion will never befall them again according to Christ's promise in the same prophecy  Compare the said prophecy with that of Daniel ix  But though this great and dreadful day of the Lord is certainly past yet the Jews do not allow that the promised Elijah is yet come Nevertheless they sent Priests and Levites from Jerusalem to enquire of John the Baptist  Who art thou Art thou Elias  and he saith I am not Art "thou that prophet" meaning most likely that prophet promised by Moses in Deut xviii and verses who was afterwards acknowledged by about five thousand Jews at one time for so many were joint witnesses of one of his miracles being convinced by all their senses of  seeing hearing  and  tasting  and he answered  no  But notwithstanding that John was a different person from Elijah the prophet according to his  own confession yet he was most certainly the pro∣phet promised by  Malachi  under the prophetical appellation of  Elijah  which denoted the excellency of his spiritual mission for the angel Gabriel told his father Zacharias in the temple that John should go before the Lord in the  "spirit and power of Elias"  See St Luke i And afterwards Christ himself bore witness of him  if ye will receive it  this is Elias  See also Matthew xvii  which was for to come  Matt xi and in the same chapter he calls him  a prophet yea and more than a prophet  he being the Lord's messenger promised by Malachi iii to prepare his way before him  John was likewise a lawgiver  as well as a prophet and messenger for  there went out to him  Jerusalem and all Judea and all the region round  about Jordan  Matth iii And when he warned them to flee from the wrath to come  the people asked him saying what shall we do then  Luke iii and we find by the succeed∣ing verses that he instructed them accordingly not only with general doctrine but even with particular advice suitable to the different classes of men These testimonies of the Evangelists in favour of John are confirmed in no small degree even by the  Jewish historian  Josephus who calls him  a good man  for indeed his life and conversa∣tion  was so exemplary and unblameable that many of the Jews as Josephus informs us believed the destruction of Herod's army to be a just judgment of God for the murder of that  good man  Of whom Josephus in the place above quoted gives us the following character that his whole crime was his exhorting the Jews to the love and practice of virtue and first of all to piety justice and regenera∣tion or newness of life not by the bare abstinence from this or that particular sin but by an habitual purity of mind and body  "Now" continues he  so great was the credit and authority of this holy man as appears by the multitude of his disciples and the veneration they had for his doc∣trine for he could do what he would with them that Herod not knowing how far the reputation of a man of his spirit might influence the people toward a revolt resolved at length to take him off before it was too late  c He adds  that Herod was very unsuccessful in his war with the Arabian king all which the Jews looked upon as a just judgment of God upon him for that im∣pious murder  Univ Hist vol  x  p    See Jewish Antiq book xviii c  John was not indeed of the tribe of Judah yet it cannot be denied but that he was  a Jew  according to what has been before observed con∣cerning the Asmonaean princes and  Herod the king of Judea  Luke i and he might very well be accounted a  lawgiver from between the feet of Judah  for he was born in the  hill country of Judea  Luke i in a  city of Juda  Luke i  at a time  when that tribe was in full possession of its inheritance  But the circumstance which more particularly points out the accomplishment of Jacob's prophecy in this holy Nazarite  John was a  Nazarite  unto God from his mother's womb  as Sampson one of the  judges  of Israel had been before him Compare Judges xvi with St Luke i But Christ could not properly be called a Nazarite as Dr Wms supposes him to be without a contra∣diction to the usual sense of that title in the Jewish law  is that John was the very last of the  Jewish lawgivers or prophets  For though on extraordinary occasions some prophetical sen∣tences may have been uttered by men adhering to Judaism after the coming of Christ such as the remarkable prophecy of Caiaphas the highpriest concerning Christ  that it was expedient that one man should die for the people  c John xi  See what a manifest though unwilling testimony even  the unbelieving Jews  bare of Christ's heavenly mission  Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council and said  What do we  for  this man doeth many miracles  If we thus let him alone  all men will believe on him  and the Romans  shall come and take away both our place and nation  And one of them named Caiaphas being  the highpriest  that same year said unto them Ye know nothing at all nor consider that it is expedient for us  that one man should die for the people and that the whole nation perish not  And this spake he not of him∣self but being highpriest that year  he prophesied  that Jesus should die for that nation  c John xi  yet the Jews cannot prove that a single prophet  professedly as such has been sent to them from God ever since the time of John that is for above years except they will condescend to allow to St Paul Agabus and others of the primitive Christians the title of prophets but these were under the dispensation of the New Testament after the ceremonial and typical law was annulled and therefore cannot be reckoned among the  Jewish  lawgivers or prophets  This was confirmed by Christ himself Luke xvi "the  law  and the  prophets  were  until John  " And again Matth xi  for  all the prophets  and  the law prophesied until John  These are sufficient authorities I hope to justify my supposition that the  prophet  and  lawgiver de∣parted from Judah  at the death of John the Baptist or rather was gradually departing for some time before his death because as  Christ increased John decreased  according to his own prophecy recorded by John the Evangelist iii  Ye yourselves bear me witness that I said  I am not the Christ  but that I am sent before him He that hath  the bride  that is  the church  or congregation for John had just before been told that Christ  bap∣tizeth  and  all men come to him  th verse  is the bridegroom but the friend of the bride∣groom which standeth and heareth him rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice this my joy is therefore fulfilled He  must increase  but I  must decrease  When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized  more disciples  than John though Jesus himself baptized not but his disciples he left Judea and departed again into Galilee  John iv  He that cometh from above is above all he that is of the earth is earthly and speaketh of the earth he that cometh from heaven is above all And what he hath seen and heard that he testifieth and no man receiveth his testimony He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true For he whom God hath sent speak∣eth the words of God for God giveth not the Spirit by measure  unto him  The Father loveth the Son and hath given all things into his hand He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life but the wrath of God abideth on him  Thus far the Evangelist seems to be relating the testimony of John the second Elias  In the th chapter st verse of the same Evan∣gelist we read that this remarkable testimony was afterwards referred to by Christ himself  If I bear witness of myself said Christ my witness is not true There  is another  that beareth witness of me and I know that the witness which he wit∣nesseth of me is true  Ye sent unto John  and  he bare witness unto the truth But I receive  not testimony from man  nevertheless our Lord condescended to give the Jews an opportunity of being convinced by  the testimony of man  a man whom they almost universally esteemed on account of the purity of his life which I have already shewn from the authority even of the  Jewish  historian Josephus  The mercy of God therefore is apparent in this condescension and though our Lord himself de∣clared that he received not  "testimony from man"  yet he added  "but these things"  relating to John's testimony  "I say that ye might be saved"  He then gives a most lively and comprehensive though short description of the holy character of this his harbinger  "He was"  says our Lord  "a burning and a shining light"  and he re∣minds the Jews that they formerly testified a very particular approbation of this holy person  and ye were willing  says he  for a season  to rejoice in his light  But I have greater witness than that of  John  for  the works  which the Father hath given me to finish the same works that I do  bear witness  of me that the Father hath sent me  And the Father himself  which hath sent me hath borne witness of me Ye have neither heard his voice at any time nor seen his shape And ye have not  his word  abiding in you for whom he hath sent him ye believe not  Search  the Scriptures  for in them ye think ye have eternal life and they are they which testify of me  Thus Christ pointed out to the Jews three incontestible indications of the truth of his holy doctrine  st The testimony of John the Baptist with which he  indulged  them though the same might be esteemed unnecessary for the cause of him who "  receives not testimony  from man"  dly His own  mighty works  daily wrought among them which as he said  bear witness  of me that the Father hath sent me  And dly The  witness of the Father himself  though as Christ expressed himself to the Jews  Ye have neither heard his voice at any time nor seen his shape  but he seems plainly to direct them to that  witness of God  which has in all ages been apparent in the accomplishment of the  word of the Lord by his prophets  Even the unbelieving Jews themselves pretended to believe  the Scriptures  and acknowledged them to be  the word of God  and therefore Christ referred them to the Scriptures as being  the witness  of the Father himself  "Search the Scriptures"  c But they wilfully neglected to make a right use of such ample testimony and were therefore inex∣cusable "Do not think" said Christ  that I will accuse you to the Father there is one that accuseth you  even Moses in whom ye trust  For had ye believed Moses ye would have believed  me for he wrote of me But if ye believe not  his writings  how shall ye believe my words  In the very next chapter vi the Evan∣gelist relates the accomplishment of one of the circumstances of Jacob's prophecy as recorded by Moses viz  and unto him shall the gathering of the people be  "After these things" says St John  Jesus went over the sea of Galilee which is the sea of Tibe∣rias and A GREAT MULTITUDE FOLLOWED HIM  because they saw his miracles  c And again th and th verses "then those men" the five thousand persons who were fed by Christ with five barley loaves and two small fishes  when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did said This is of a truth that prophet  that should come into  the world When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and  take him by force to make him a king  for they could not possibly give him a greater proof of their sincerity in  gathering to him  as the true Shiloh  he departed again into a mountain him∣self alone  The people of Israel as Mr Mann observes in his learned treatise de Anno Natali Christi p were not the only people that were to be  gathered  unto Shiloh not one nation only is pointed at in the prophecy  but many nations  The patriarch's words were not  the gathering  of this people  or nation but in the plural number  the gathering  of the nations  which has been  apparently fulfilled for the nations have at dif∣ferent times almost universally submitted to the faith of our Lord Jesus the true Shiloh notwith∣standing that many have since fallen back into gross ignorance superstition and unbelief  We have a dreadful example of this in the present state of the once enlightened Grecian empire of the greatest part of Asia and of almost the whole vast continent of Africa Nay the greatest part even of Europe itself hath long since resumed the veil of its former darkness and the shadow of death for the superstitious vanities of Rome bear too great a resemblance to the old Heathen idolatries and the multitude of Atheists Deists and of those who neglect Christ's holy sacraments is an alarming indication of a  falling off  even among ourselves  The  gather∣ing of the people  to impostors does not at all affect the certainty of the sign given by the patriarch Jacob in  the gathering of the people  to Shiloh  Many false Christs have indeed appeared accord∣ing to our Lord's prediction in Matthew xxiv  For there shall arise false Christs and false prophets and shall shew great signs and wonders insomuch that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect  Behold I have told you before  c  Luke xxi  Take heed that ye be not deceived for many shall come in my name saying I am Christ and the time draweth near go ye not therefore after them  and to such the Jews have zealously  gathered  themselves for  they received not the love of the truth that they might be saved And for this cause God sent them  strong delusion  as  foretold by St Paul  that they should believe a lie  Thess ii  The same people who rejected the  truth  through  hardness of heart  and  want of faith  very soon afterwards by a  contrary  infatuation rendered them∣selves despicable by the most  absurd credulity  Even the  Jewish  historian Josephus gives ample testimony of the proneness of his countrymen to error and false doctrine and that they were easily led away by impostors and deceivers He relates a very remarkable instance of it in their being led out by an Egyptian to the mount of Olives from whence he had undertaken to shew them a won∣derful spectacle viz that the walls of Jerusalem should fall at his command  Antiq book xx chap p    The same spiritual blindness continued even after  the abomination of desolation  notwithstanding the apparent judgment of God upon them in the de∣struction of their great and once holy city for they have as readily since that time as before acknowledged the incredible pretensions of several impostors who have at different times set themselves up for the true Messiah For instance the infamous Barchocheba  or  Son of a Star  in the reign of the emperor Adrian was gladly received and zealously supported among the Jews until an immense slaughter of his miserable adherents plainly demonstrated that he was more properly intitled Bar∣chozba      Son of a Lie  The Jews were also notably deceived by Sabbatei Sevi who wick∣edly took upon himself the character of the Messiah But it is remarkable that it was the Jews alone and not  all the other nations of the world  that were gathered to these counterfeits which ought to de∣monstrate to the  present house of Israel  the apparent difference between the true Messiah and the miser∣able deceivers abovementioned  Thus I hope I have shewn that the sceptre did not depart from Judah nor a lawgiver from be∣tween his feet  until Shiloh was come  and that  the gathering of the people  not of one nation only but  of the universe  at different times has been unto Christ himself according to the Scriptures  Bring forth the blind people that  have eyes  and the  deaf  that  have ears  Let  all the nations  be  ga∣thered together  and let the people be assembled who among them can declare this and shew us former things Let them bring forth their wit∣nesses that they may be justified or let  them hear  and  say  "It is  Truth  "  Isaiah xliii  Glory be to God in the highest and on earth peace goodwill towards men  The  END  of  PART IV  AN ANSWER TO SOME OF THE Principal Arguments used by Dr WMS IN DEFENCE OF HIS CRITICAL DISSERTATION ON ISAIAH vii c IN WHICH The opinions of the late Dr SYKES and Dr GEORGE BENSON concerning  Accommodations  of Scripture Prophecy  are briefly  considered  AN ANSWER TO Some of the principal Arguments used by Dr WMS in Defence of his Critical Disser∣tation on ISAIAH vii c  I HAVE pointed out to Dr Wms several mistakes in his Critical Dissertation on Isaiah vii yet he hath not thought proper to acknowledge one of them though he has laboured to disprove several Some of the principal arguments which the Doctor has advanced in favour of his hypothesis are considered in the following pages  But before I proceed to a defence of my remarks it may be necessary for me to examine a very im∣portant question concerning the interpretation of Scripture prophecies notwithstanding that Dr Wms apprehends the same to be  sufficiently  and even  conclusively decided already  viz Whether any "allegorical meanings and double senses of "Scripture prophecies are to be allowed  It is impossible says the Dr to determine when any prophecy is fulfilled if it has more than one single sense If it has two says he it may have two hundred and all of them equally just  For the confirmation of this sentiment he refers me to Dr George Benson's preface to the first volume of his paraphrase and notes on St Paul's Epistles and to Dr Sykes's Connexion of natural and revealed Religion page c  These I have examined with as much care I be∣lieve as is necessary and find that the third objection to Dr George Benson's hypothesis quoted even in his own Introduction p xxxiv obliges him to make such large concessions concerning types and figures thatnotwithstanding his great zeal against double fenses his denying of them seems a mere disagree∣ment in terms and not in effect from the general received opinion  In his answer to the said objection he allows p xxxv  That wherever the  law  or the  Prophets  have declared that the rites and ceremonies of  the Mosaic constitution  were intended to point out a moral obligation or to prefigure the  Messiah  or something in the Christian dispensation there that moral intention or prophetic prefiguration is the one true sense of the text c  See the Doctor's answer at length in p xxxv  Here he plainly allows of a direct application in some cases to the antitype which he calls  the  one true sense of the text  But how as a rea∣sonable man he can possibly avoid acknowledging the necessary consequence of this his concession I leave all candid readers to judge for if there is an allegorical sense alluding to the antitype which he calls "a  moral intention  or  prophetic prefiguration  " there must certainly be likewise a  literal sense  ap∣plicable  to the type itself  Indeed the Doctor has in that place refined his argument to so small a thread that it becomes almost imperceptible  The next objection quoted by Dr Benson is as follows Object IV  Are not many pas∣sages in the New Testament taken from the Old Testament and used in a quite different sense from what they have as they stand in the original writer and must not these be called double senses of the words of sacred Scripture  To this the Doctor answers  It is acknowledged that our Lord and his Apostles and Evangelists have taken several passages from the Old Testament and used them in a very different sense from what they have as connected with the place from whence they were taken  But that will not prove a double sense of the words I may quote a passage from  Homer  or  Virgil Herodotus  or  Livy  to express my present meaning and in quite another sense from what it has in those antient authors But that will not  prove that those antient authors intended their words should be understood in two senses In the original intention they had only one meaning In  my accommodation of them  they have only one meaning And though the same words may have different ideas affixed to them and be used by successive speakers or writers in various senses yet that does not prove that in the original in∣tention they had more than one signification  Now I readily allow that Dr Benson's idea of  an accommodation  is certainly true in such cases as he has supposed viz in quotations from  Homer or Virgil c  To express a present meaning in quite another sense from what it has in those antient authors  And I as readily assent to a part of Dr Wms quotation in page of his Critical Dissertation from a very learned author  Dr GREGORY SHARPESee his second argument in Defence of Christianity taken from the ancient prophecies page  The sentence which immediately follows the above extract ought by no means to be omitted when the author's sentiments on this head are quoted viz  But indeed to an attentive mind the difference will appear very great between the citations from prophane authors and the prophets  viz that when  passages in the Grecian poets are cited or alluded to in the writings of the New  or Old  "Testament" the same  are not to be considered as prophecies  For indeed they cannot other∣wise be esteemed than as  a mere accommodation of phrases  But when the  word of the Lord by his prophets  or as St Matthew warily expresses himself  that which was  spoken of the Lord  by  the prophet  is cited by an evangelist and declared  to be fulfilled  the idea of "a  mere accommodation  " becomes highly improper not only in a grammatical but also in a religious sense  Therefore in answer to all that has been said in favour of  accommodations  I must observe that the  fulfilling  of proverbs and phrases or of quotations from poets and historians by  a similarity of circum∣stances  is so widely different from  the fulfilling of a prophecy  that the true meaning of the word  fulfill  when applied to the latter cannot justly be ascertained by such a comparison  The word of  a prophet  especially the word of the LORD by a PROPHET implies a  foretelling  or pro∣mise of future things which must in due time be  fulfilled  as  all things must  be fulfilled  said our Lord which were written in the law of Moses and in the prophets and in the Psalms concerning me  Luke xxiv  Therefore when we are told that  "the word which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet" is fulfilled  we  cannot either with grammatical or religious pro∣priety as I have before observed understand any other  fulfilling or accomplishment  than that which was originally intended by the holy spirit to be pre∣figured  Because we cannot allow that a scripture prophecy is  accommodated  to a particular sense to which it originally had no reference  See page Crit Dissert    unless we allow likewise that such  an accommodation  is absolutely a  perversion  of the  primary  sense of the prophet for readers would not only be thereby perplexed and misled with respect to the true accomplishment ori∣ginally and singly intended by the words of the pro∣phet so cited but would also be naturally led to con∣ceive that the matters related by the evangelist were intentionally prefigured or foretold thereby which would be a deception of no small discredit to the evangelist if his comparison had really no other relation to the prophecy than that  of a  similiarity of circumstances  So that such a misapplication of scripture pro∣phecy cannot otherwise be considered than as a de∣ception leading to a  double misconstruction  as above which would be as little suitable to the testimony of an evangelist  "by way of illustration"  as to the original sense of the prophet whatever Dr Benson  may think of it or Dr Wms either See his Remarks p  If all this be duly considered I think no one can reasonably suppose that an evangelist would attempt to  mislead  his readers by declaring a prophecy to be accomplished  or fulfilled  in  a particular sense to which it  originally had no reference  See Cri∣tical Dissert p  Dr Benson in page xxii of his introduction in∣forms us that  if the iid and xvith Psalms can be shown quite throughout to agree to king David then they ought to be interpreted of him But if as some judicious persons have thought there be in them some expressions which are not applicable to king David then they should be interpreted wholly concerning the Messiah to whom they do in every part very well agree  Now I am of the same opinion with Dr Benson that these two Psalms are undoubtedly to be inter∣preted of the Messiah and I do not at all contend for the application of them to David  I only object therefore to the Doctor's rule of interpretation which he has applied to the said Psalms because I think it will be liable in a great variety of applications to mislead and perplex those persons who may happen to adopt it  For instance the lxxiid Psalm of which he speaks in the same page is undoubtedly a prophecy of Christ's kingdom as Dr Benson interprets it yet  his rule seems to lead him into a real difficulty con∣cerning it because he is thereby obliged to deny the least reference to king Solomon when it plainly appears by the title of the Psalm  "To So∣lomon"  that the psalmist absolutely addressed himself  to Solomon  who in the beginning of his reign was manifestly a type of the spiritual Solomon or Shiloh  or  the prince  of "peace  Isaiah ix  "  Indeed the Doctor's rule can by no means be ad∣mitted if we consider the nature and general style of prophetical writings and the abrupt transitions fre∣quently found therein of which I have given am∣ple and undeniable proofs from the viith viiith and ixth chapters of Isaiah See the second part of my remarks on the Critical Dissertation  These passages and many others of the same kind very much confirm what I have wrote Part II p concerning the passage quoted by St Matthew from Hosea viz  out of Egypt have I called my son  and I think must prove to all considerate people that Dr Sykes the other cham∣pion for accommodations to whom Dr Wms has referred me has been much too precipitate in decla∣ring pages and of his Connexion of natural and revealed Religion  that the prophet in this text is not speaking of  any future event  and that the  term  fulfilled cannot imply a prophecy of our Sa∣viour's going into Egypt or coming from thence  cThe same observation may with justice be made concerning Dr Wms who boldly asks page "How can it be said that any thing is ful∣filled "which was not spoken to be fulfilled as in chap ii Matthew  or not spoken by a pro∣phet in the sense in which it is cited by an evan∣gelist  Also the Doctor declares in page concerning this passage that it  could not be ful∣filled  when the  child Jesus  came out of  Egypt  In answer to these assertions I must observe in the first place that they cannot by any means be proved And secondly that it is most reasonable to believe this text of Hosea to be a prophecy of Christ be∣cause the style and construction of the sentence itself is so peculiarly adapted to the  single person  of the Messiah that the Seventy have thought themselves obliged to leave the  literal sense  of the original in order to render it more suitable in their translation to  the people  of Israel all which I have before parti∣cularly noted  But there are still other reasons to be given in fa∣vour of it  Though the people of Israel are here spoken of in such a manner that Dr Wms thinks he has sufficient reason to intitle it  a declaration of an event long past  yet St Matthew expresly quotes it as a prophecy viz as  that which was spoken of  the Lord by the prophet  which expression could not with any propriety be used if the words of the prophet were merely an  historical relation  for they could not in that case be said to be  spoken of the Lord  Thus it plainly appears that there is not the least room to suppose  an accommodation  So that notwithstanding all that has been said by Dr Sykes Dr G Benson and Dr Wms against double senses it must unavoidably be allowed that the  declaration in this place  of an event long past  prefigured  an event to come  and conse∣quently that  this single text  affords an indisputable proof of the subsistance of double senses in the Scrip∣tures  Though some Christians have run into errors by turning every thing into allegory double senses pa∣rables and types whether they were really so or not yet this is no just argument why we should indiscrimi∣nately reject all constructions of this kind  And though I contend for double senses in some cases yet I am as averse to an unnecessary multipli∣cation of them as Dr Wms can be and there∣fore reject and protest against the Doctor's proposi∣tion in page of his MS reply to my remarks that if a prophecy  has two  senses  it may have two hundred and all of them equally just  The  fulfilling of a prophecy  as I have before ob∣served must mean the  only true accomplishment or  completion of it  so that it cannot justly be extended or applied to any further circumstances than those particularly and originally intended therefore when an evangelist has declared a prophecy  to be fulfilled  though he may have convinced us that the prophet's words referred to are capable of bearing  a double sense  viz one literal and one allegorical or prefi∣gurative which he himself points out yet at the same time he manifestly excludes the other senses notwithstanding that Dr Wms thinks  "all of them equally just"  For after a declaration is made  of indisputable authority  that a prophecy  is fulfilled  it would be not only impertinent but presumptuous to look for  a further accomplish∣ment  It is necessary however for me to observe that the  fulfilling of some particular prophecies  includes a considerable length of time as well as a variety of circumstances and places  Of this I propose to give one remarkable in∣stance which will afford me at the same time a proper opportunity of speaking more particularly to Dr Sykes  The Doctor in his Connexion of natural and re∣vealed Religion chap x p affirms  that our Saviour and his apostles applied the term  to ful∣fill  when there was only a similitude of circum∣stances and that they cited the words of the Old Testament and made use of that term upon  the application of them where they did not de∣sign to express the  accomplishment  of a  prophecy  You have says the Doctor  an instance very clear  in Matthew xiii where our Saviour gives the reason why he spoke to the people in parables  because  says he  they seeing see not and hearing they hear not neither do they under∣stand  And in them is  fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias which saith by hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand and seeing ye shall see and shall not perceive For this peoples heart is  waxed gross and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes they have closed lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and should understand with their hearts and should be converted and I should heal them  Our Saviour says the Doctor applies these words to the Jews in Judea and St Paul many years afterwards applies the very same prophecy to the Jews at Rome  This shews continues he that though the term  fulfill  when applied to an  event foretold does  signify the accomplishment of  a real prophecy  yet it was used in cases where there was no accomplishment of a prediction but only a  similitude of circum∣stances  and consequently the application of the words of a prophet to a certain particular event by w  i  h they are said to  be fulfilled  does not  a double sense of prophecy  or that such a  particular event  was foretold  But the real meaning of the word must be deter∣mined by other circumstances such as whether the prophet is speaking of a future event or not or in short by those means by which one knows whether the words are prophetic or not  But before all this reasoning of Dr Sykes be admitted we ought carefully to examine the foun∣dation or proof on which it is built  This he calls  "an instance very clear"  but I hope to convince my readers that it is  no instance at all of this matter  and consequently that the Doc∣tor's conclusion thereupon is unjust  Were not the Jews one people and descended from the same stock whether they lived at Jerusa∣lem or Rome  If this be granted and I think the most zealous advocates for Dr Sykes will not deny it it must ne∣cessarily be allowed likewise that this remarkable prophecy of Esaias concerning them viz  by hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand  c Isaiah vi was  manifestly fulfilled  when the Jews rejected the doctrine of Christ whether preached by himself at one time or by his apostles at other different times  So I think I may safely conclude that the two  dif∣ferent applications  quoted by Dr Sykes of this same prophecy were not occasioned as he supposes by a  mere  "similitude of circumstances"  but by a  direct accomplishment  of  the prediction  in  both cases  Now as this example cannot any longer serve the cause in favour of which it was quoted by Dr Sykes I hope it will not be esteemed an im∣proper example of a very  different argument  and therefore I shall beg leave to claim it on my side of the question as  "an instance very clear"  of the truth of the observation which I made above viz that the  fulfilling  of some particular prophecies includes a considerable length of time as well as a variety of circumstances and places  However I must not leave this text without coming to a further explanation with Dr Wms concerning it because he has brought a very heavy accusation against me concerning the parallel account given by St Mark chap iv  He charges me with  reflecting  severely on the character of the blessed Jesus  by saying  that he taught in parables lest they should understand and be saved  "Our Saviour" says the Doctor  gave a very different reason for his conduct and Mr S should have rendered the passage Mark iv agreeable to the evangelist's words in the d verse of the same chapter  should be there translated  if per∣adventure  as it is in d Timothy ii  However I am not at all conscious I thank God  of having in the least respect offended against the character of our blessed Lord  Neither do I know of any  severe reflection  in this case except the Doctor's  own charge  against myself  Whatever sense the word  may bear in other places yet in the parallel places of St Matthew and Mark abovementioned it must necessarily be construed  "lest"  or to that effect for as the sense of the context must confirm the true meaning of any particular word it will be found upon ex∣amination that the Doctor's sense of these passages cannot possibly be admitted  The words of Christ according to the testimony of both these evangelists point out the material distinction which he then made between those that were true believers and the reprobate Jews whom our Lord called "them that are without" see Mark iv to the former it was  given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God  Matthew xiii Mark iv But to the latter says St Matthew  "it is not given"  Now this necessary distinction is entirely lost by Dr Wms's interpretation because there is no such distinction made in the d verse of the fourth chapter of St Mark the sense of which the Doctor proposes to adopt for the evangelist is there speaking of Christ's preaching in general to the whole multitude including those to whom  it  was given to know  as well as those to whom it was "not given" and this is certain because in the very next verse the th we read that afterwards  when they were alone  he expounded all things to his disciples  Now it might very well be said of Christ's preaching to the whole multitude of good and bad together that  with many such parables spake he the word unto them as they  were able to hear it  because Christ observed this same method even when he taught his disciples alone and at last de∣clared to them soon before his passion  I have yet many things to say unto you but ye  cannot bear them now  John xvi  But when the  reprobate  Jews are spoken of  separately and distinctly  from those to  whom it  was  "given to know"  it cannot be understood that the word was spoken  unto them as they  were able to hear it  Because it is apparent that they  were never able to hear it or bear it  according to the true sense of these phrases which imply such a comprehension of the doctrine as may produce an assent or belief otherwise the prophecy of Isaiah which Christ then referred to could not have been fulfilled  Be∣cause  seeing they see not  said our Lord and hearing  they hear not  neither do  they under∣stand  Which is very different from being spoken to as Dr Wms would have it  as they  were able to  hear    And in them continued our Lord is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias which saith by hearing ye shall hear and  shall not understand  and seeing ye shall see and  shall not perceive  Therefore it is plain that St Mark's expression chap iv cannot be applied to these when distinctly spoken of from the rest of the congregation "For this people's heart" said Isaiah  is waxed gross and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes  they have closed lest  at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and should understand with their heart and should be converted and I should heal them  said our Lord The closing of their eyes was their own act and deed  their eyes  THEY  have closed  LEST  they should see  c  So that there was no partiality  For  the reason why these mysteries are no more plainly delivered unto them the Jews is for their foregoing obstinacy  See ASSEMBLY'S ANNOT on the said text  Dr Hammond paraphrases the th verse to the same effect viz that  this is a just judgment of God's upon them for their obduration and obstinacy  c  Mons Martin likewise explains this to the same purpose  Cest a dire que Dieu se cache a ceux qui l'ayant pu trouver ne se sont pas mis en etat de le chercher qu'il livre a leurs prejuges a leur tenebres ceux qui ont ferme les yeux a la verité  in their condem∣nation  they having rendered themselves unworthy of a clearer revelation by their unwillingness to be converted They rejected such evidence as Christ was pleased to give them which would have been amply sufficient had they not  not wilfully shut their eyes against it  for St John says chap iii  this is the condemnation that light is come into the world and men loved darkness rather than light because their works are evil  Therefore they were  justly esteemed unworthy  to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven  For "whosoever hath" said our Lord  to him shall be given and he shall have more abundance but whosoever  hath not  from him  shall be taken away  even  that he hath  THEREFORE  speak I to them in parables because they seeing see not  c  The words  "THEREFORE" plainly refer to the foregoing sentence viz  but whosoever  hath not  from him  shall be taken away  c  So that the scope and tenor of the argument would be entirely destroyed if Dr Wms's sense of the parallel passage in St Mark were to be admitted For Christ plainly intended to shew that the unbe∣lieving Jews would lose even what little knowledge they had so far would they be from understanding or receiving his parables And the event plainly proved this for they fell from bad to worse untill  the total destruction of Jerusalem when  the abo∣mination of desolation  spoken of by Daniel was accomplished  St Mark does not indeed express the very words of the prophet Isaiah nor mention the quotation made of them by Christ but he plainly delivers the  full sense of them  as they were really  fulfilled  in the unbelieving Jews viz  "Unto you" said Christ to his disciples  it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God but unto  them that are without  all these things are done in parables THAT seeing they may see  and not perceive  and hearing they may hear and  not understand  LEST at any time they should be converted and their sins should be forgiven them  The particle  "THAT" followed by verbs in the subjunctive mood  c cannot possibly be made sense of if the word  "LEST" is translated  "if peradventure"  because the negative  viz  and  "may  not see  and  may not understand  " absolutely leads to a different sense from that proposed by Dr Wms  So that it is most reasonable to conclude with Dr Hammond that these words  that seeing  c  note the obduration of the Isra∣elites which fell on them from God's desertion as a punishment of their not making use of the  talents which he had given them and so this verse is answerable and parallel to Matthew xiii or the end of that place in Isaiah recited and set down at large in St Matthew but here and so also in Luke viii and John xii  epitomized and summed up  lest they should see  c  The word  therefore cannot in ei∣ther of these places be construed  "if peradventure"  without destroying the propriety of our Lord's quota∣tion from Isaiah delivered at length by St Mat∣thew and  epitomized by St Mark  as above for the word  in the original prophecy is properly rendered  in the Syriac and LEST in the English translations and cannot possibly bear any other sense agreeable to the context because the prophet plainly foretold that the Jews would  wilfully shut their eyes      LEST they should see with their eyes  Now men do not usually  shut their eyes  in order  to see therewith  or according to Dr Wms's interpretation of    "if peradventure"  they may see with their eyes but rather that they may  not see  or according to the propriety of the English translation of    LEST  they should see  with their eyes  c  The closing of the eyes in this place is indeed a mere figurative expression for the insensibility and wicked obstinacy of the Jews yet the same reason∣ing  holds good notwithstanding this consideration and sufficiently proves that the word  must be construed  negatively  and not as Dr Wms proposes "if  peradventure  "  By this example we learn that some parables were not only difficult to those reprobate unbelievers whom St Mark calls  "them that are without"  but also even to the true disciples themselves who by misunderstanding the parable of the sower and by desiring an explanation of it see th verse occasioned this remarkable answer of our Lord the purport of which is recorded in the two texts con∣sidered above  Nevertheless there were very many cases wherein the teaching by parables and types was not only the safest and most prudent but also the shortest and clearest method of conveying a true idea of the proposed doctrine as being very suitable to the genius and customs of the Eastern nations in general and of the Jews in particular and also because the types and figures themselves would make a very deep impression on the memory and by their well known characters clearly illustrate the allegorical meaning  I propose now to reconsider the principal subject of my remarks viz the prophecy of Isaiah con∣cerning the birth of Immanuel  Dr Wms has asserted page  that the evangelist only alludes to the passage in Isaiah  because it was  remarkably suitable  to the matter which he was relating  This occasioned my question to the Doctor viz  If  does not signify a virgin in what sense can the text be esteemed  remarkably suitable  to the miraculous conception  of a virgin  by the Holy Ghost And in what manner could the  accom∣modation of it  to that singular event assist the sacred historian as he supposes  by way of illustration  See Part I page  I afterwards observe that the Doctor  has taken great pains to make the text  remarkably unsuitable  by insinuating that  the YOUNG WOMAN as he construes it spoken of in the text was so far from being a  virgin  that she was  with child  even at the time when she was pointed at as he devises in p by the prophet  To which the Doctor replies  had St Matthew alluded to the birth of this child it would have been  very unsuitable  Now this concession is sufficient for my purpose because the Doctor's insinuation that the evangelist alluded only  "to the name Immanuel"  and not to the other circumstances related by the prophet must appear entirely groundless when we consider the words of St Matthew  For though the evangelist interpreted the name  Immanuel  yet this does not prove that he referred  merely to  this name  but rather that no other person but the Messiah himself could properly be intitled  "God with us"  and consequently that he esteemed the words of Isaiah to be really a prophecy and such a one as could not be  fulfilled  except in Christ alone who was truly  "God with us"  But fartherThe evangelist's manner of introducing the quotation very clearly shews that  this name  was not the only thing he intended to allude to  For he says  NOW ALL THIS WAS DONE  that it might  be fulfilled  which was spoken  of the Lord by the prophet  behold A VIRGIN  shall be with child  and shall  bring forth a son  c  The words "ALL THIS WAS DONE" must refer to the relation before given concerning the miraculous conception of  the virgin Mary  by the Holy Ghost and therefore the prophecy of Isaiah that A VIRGIN should  conceive  and  bear a son was suitable  not in  the name only  as Doctor Wms has insinuated  but  in  the whole quotation  Another objection is made  that the birth of a child from a virgin is a fact of such a nature as not to admit of proof  "It is a fact" says the Doctor  which in the  very nature of it can∣not be a sign to  any  person  but the mother  Nevertheless the Scriptures inform us that  this sign  was clearly proved i e the wonderful event that  a  virgin had conceived  was known with absolute cer∣tainty even  before  the birth of the Messiah and this not merely by the testimony  of the mother  but by other very sufficient authorities which rendered the sign as apparent and indubitable as any other sign that was ever given even the most selfevi∣dent  For after the angel Gabriel had revealed to the virgin Mary that she although a virgin should "conceive and bring forth a son" St Luke i the same thing was confirmed to her by her cousin Elizabeth in the hill country of Judea  "Blessed is she that believed" said Elizabeth filled with the Holy Ghost  for there shall be a per∣formance of those things which were told her from the Lord  Luke i  See the whole salutation and the testimony of John the Baptist though himself at that time only a babe in the womb which clearly proves that the absolute knowledge of the fact was not confined to the  virgin mother alone  Afterwards an angel was sent from God to pre∣vent Joseph from putting away his espoused wife on account of her being with child and the angel in∣formed him before the time that she should  bring forth a son  and that he might the more effec∣tually convince him of his wife's purity and virtue he assured him saying  that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost  Matt i  Therefore though  the birth of a child from a virgin  is by Dr Wms esteemed  a fact of such a nature as not to admit of proof  yet no∣thing is impossible with God who was pleased to give these indubitable proofs of the long promised sign even whilst the child Jesus was in the womb which must entirely obviate the Doctor's objection that  "this cannot be a sign to any person but the mother"  In the fulness of time the sign was manifested in the most extraordinary manner  An angel accompanied with a multitude of the heavenly host proclaimed the wonderful birth to the shepherds in the field and a star pointed out to the eastern strangers the place where the young child lay  Undoubtedly this wonderful circumstance that A VIRGIN HAD BROUGHT FORTH A SON would in a little time be as well known to  the house of David  as these miraculous manifestations and confirmations of the said supernatural birth especially as the family of Joseph the blessed virgin's husband was  the chief branch of that royal stock  lineally descended from Zorobabel and so from the son of Jesse  There is still another difficulty with Dr Wms  I cannot perceive says he  what event  the birth of Immanuel could be a sign of unless it  could be a sign of itself  But is it really possible that Dr Wms  can∣not perceive  that the miraculous birth of the  true Immanuel was a sign of something more than that event itself  Was it not a sign to all those who then waited for  "the consolation and redemption of Israel"  Luke ii that the  kingdom of God  was  nigh at hand  Matthew xii    "But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God then  the kingdom  of  God is come  unto you"  Luke x  "And say unto them the kingdom of God  is come  nigh unto youNotwithstanding be ye sure of this that the kingdom of God is come nigh unto you"    Was it not a sign to  Joseph and others of the house of David  that a child so born must be the long promised Messiah of the  seed of David  to whom  the kingdom was to be restored  and in whom according to Isaiah's promise to his cotemporaries of  the house of David  it was to be established for ever See Isaiah ix Sam vii  But I find it is in vain that I urge to Dr Wms the accomplishment of the several pro∣phecies concerning the establishment of the  kingdom of David  in Christ for the Doctor still seems to persist in his former notion that Nathaniel  la∣boured under a mistake  in calling Christ  king of Israel  He hopes to evade the point by alledging that  not only Nathaniel and the disciples but the whole Jewish nation did actually labour under a  great mistake about  the nature  of the Messiah's kingdom  Thus he would lead me to a very different ques∣tion but I am aware that though the disciples did for some time  "labour under a mistake"  as the Doctor observes concerning  the nature of the Messiah's kingdom  yet there was  not the least mistake  in those who truly believed concerning the main point in question viz whether or not the Messiah  was really a king  Notwithstanding that our Lord rejected all the temporal authority of a worldly king and declared that his kingdom was not of this world he was nevertheless really a king  "king of Israel"  as Nathaniel called him and king of Judah or which is the same thing  "king of the Jews"  for even Pilate himself seemed convinced of Christ's just right to the title of  king  though like a thoroughpaced time server he preferred his own temporal in∣terest to all other considerations and delivered up THE KING OF KINGS Rev xvii to be slain know∣ing him to be A KING for his answer to the chief priests concerning the title intended to be affixed to the cross plainly shews that he was conscious of this  Dr Wms charges me with having  brought a vast number of texts to prove not my assertion that Jesus was ever called the king of Judah but the truth of his assertion  c concerning the  mistake of Nathaniel And he says  this will be evident to every one who consults the passages cited by me  But if the Doctor will please once more to con∣sult the passages himself he will find that several among them are prophecies which were absolutely fulfilled in our Lord Jesus  Therefore I hope he will not venture to assert that the prophets likewise  "laboured under a mistake"  when they proclaimed these titles of the glorious Messiah or that the disciples and all other Chris∣tians even to this day still "labour  under a mistake  " in applying them to Christ in whom alone they were or could be fulfilled  Rejoice greatly O daughter of Zion shout O daughter of Jerusalem behold THY KING  cometh unto thee  the prophet then proceeds to describe  this coming of  THE KING  of Zion and Jerusalem  so as exactly to correspond with the evangelist's account Luke xix of Christ's publick entry into Jerusalem when  the whole multitude of the dis∣ciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the  mighty works  that they had seen saying  blessed be  THE KING  that cometh  in the  name of the Lord  c For he was certainly  a king  even when he rode upon the ass which is proved by the continuation of Zechariah's prophecy ix whereby he points out the character and appearance of  the king of Zion and Jerusalem  mentioned in the  beginning of the same verse "he is just" said the prophet  and having salvation lowly and riding upon an ass and upon a colt the foal of an ass  So the prophet Micah declared that out of  Beth∣lehem Ephratah  should  he come forth that is to be  ruler in Israel  whose goings forth have been from of old from everlasting  chap v  The event proved the truth of the prophet's words as well as of the evangelist's citation Matt ii and for the holy one that was born at  Bethlehem  was afterwards undoubtedly  "ruler in Israel"  be∣fore the dissolution of that people from an united na∣tion of which besides the power of his teaching and his mighty works his publick entry into Jeru∣salem and the authority shewn by him in clearing the temple are remarkable proofs  That Christ was "a  ruler in Israel  " is implied in the preceding words of the same prophet Micah v  they shall  smite the judge of Israel  with a rod upon the cheek  A  ruler  and a  judge  are syno∣nymous terms and it is certain that Christ pro∣nounced  judgment  against  Israel  for their impeni∣tence and want of faithcondemning them with respect to their  temporal estate  to a horrid destruction and desolation  St Matthew chap xxiv  and as all this was most punctu∣ally fulfilled  See Josephus's account of the Jewish War  upon them it is certain likewise that  the same  "judge of Israel"  whom they smote upon the cheek will  one day judge them  also in their  eter∣nal state  as well as all their unhappy descendants who persist in the same unbelief  If these prophecies were really  fulfilled  in Jesus they most certainly prove that the Messiah was as he ever will be A KING and consequently that his disciples were not mistaken in calling him so how∣soever they might misunderstand the  nature  of his kingdom  Therefore the Doctor's reply upon this point can∣not well be esteemed a proof of any thing more than of his own great unwillingness to acknowledge that he himself instead of Nathaniel  labours under a mistake  Another remarkable excuse which the Doctor has offered in behalf of his hypothesis deserves par∣ticular notice  In answer to my remarks on Canticles vi con∣cerning the particular distinction there made of vir∣gins from queens and concubines the Doctor replies that  Hebrew poetry is not so well understood  as to enable me to determine that  in Canticles vi is not used in stead of  for the sake of metre  This unexpected turn of thought may perhaps be esteemed ingenious but it is far from satisfactory for if criticks were allowed to substitute the sense of one word for another whenever their arguments are  reduced to that necessity it would be but a vain task to dispute with them and a confusion of lan∣guage like that of the builders of Babel must necessarily succeed their perversion of words  In English poetry the Doctor may produce as many instances of such substitutions as he pleases and he may rest assured that I shall never think it worth my while to attempt a confutation of them  But when such refined criticisms are applied to any part of Holy Scripture I think they ought not by any means to be admitted unless the authors of them shall be able to prove that it is more justifi∣able to adapt the Scriptures to our own private opi∣nions than our opinions to the Scriptures  The  END  of  PART V  INDEX OF Texts referred to in the
