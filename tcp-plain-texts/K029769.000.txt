 THE CAPTIVES A TRAGEDY As Performed at the THEATREROYAL DRURYLANE  By the Author of THE ROYAL SUPPLIANTS  LONDON Printed for T CADELL in the Strand  M DCC LXXXVI  ADVERTISEMENT  THE  Captives  are at length released from the theatre where they have been confined for more than three months and now they hope to find a sanctuary in the closet It was the intention of the author throughout his piece to make experiment of a style and diction different from what are usual in modern Tragedy Overwrought ornaments and pompous versification he thought ill suited to the manners of those early times in which the action of his Tragedy is supposed to have passed In a word he was of opinion that the language of simplicity would best accord with the subject and the characters but whether a plain intelligible and unaffected style would be acceptable to the public taste was what he had still to learn The experiment has been made and the author retires with the satisfaction of having at least intended well  March    PROLOGUE  By THOMAS VAUGHAN Esq  The Speaker Mr BANNISTER jun in the Character of a distressed and disappointed Poet peeping in at the door looks round the house  ARE you all seatedmay I venture in  Noise behind  Hushbe quietstop your unfriendly din  Whilst Iwith more than common grief oppress'd  A tale unfoldjust bursting from my breast  Advancing points to the Pit doors  But firstare both your pit doors shut I pray  Or noise will drown my strictures on the play  Noise from front boxes opening doors and calling places  Do you hearhow very hard my case is  Instead of bravo bravoplacesplaces  mimicking  Your seat my Lord is hereyour La'ship's there  Indeed it quite distracts both bard and player  Truce then with your confounded clank of keys  And tell these fair disturbers of our ease  At church  perhaps 'tis no such mighty crime  But  here  quite vulgar to be out of time  Noise from front boxes repeated  Againwhy sure the devil's in the clown  Do pray Sir Harry knock that fellow down  pointing  And you ye Godsit were a dreadful shock  If thrown from thencea Critic's head is rock  the pit  So keep your centres and my bus'ness know  I am a bard as these my  Acts  will shew  Pulling out plays from each coat pocket  But then the managersaye there's the curse  Which makes us  patient bear  the sad reverse  To hear they've several pieces to peruse  And when I call all answer they refuse  But say is't fit that mine be laid aside  To gratify their present author's pride  Who comes with nature and such idle stuff  As please my friends above there well enough  the galleries  When I more bold and daring quit all rules  In the pompous burlesque of Tragedy  And scorn to draw from Classics and the Schools  But bid the dreadful surges from a grave  To sink the merchant "in the bankrupt wave"  Or when I long for fair Aurora's light  "I am witchridden by the hag of night"  Thus always keep  sublimity  in eye  And sometimes hand in hand  simplicity  New traps new passages for ever raise  With starts and attitudes to gain your praise  Try every incident of trick and art  To mend at once the drama and the heart  Such is  my  style and such each nervous line  Which all my friends who read pronounce divine  And yet these hostile doors their barriers keep  And all  my  laboursin my pockets sleep  Pointing to them  Revenge my cause assert each critic right  And damn with me the author of tonight  Whose play tho' yet  unknown untried unseen  Has felt in paragraphs an author's spleen  But harkI'll tell you a secret'twas I  Who drew the shaft and forg'd th' envenom'd lie  To crush this simple nature which he boasts  Drawn from the manners of the northern coasts  For should  his  hope your generous plaudits meet  I  shall be found aboardthe  Lighter Fleet  Advances forward and kneels  Then hear a malefactor in blank verse  Nor be led  captive  by his Gothick Erse  But urge my vengeance in the catcall's curse  Going stops and looks around the house  Yet hold methinks my words seem lost in air  And smiles of candour for the bard declare  For here no  secret influence  e'er was known  But merit triumphs  in herself alone  As all who know ye must in this agree  A British audience  ever  will be free  Dramatis Personae  MEN  CONNAL  Mr BARRYMORE  ERRAGON  Mr SMITH  HIDALLAN  Mr BENSLEY  EVERALLIN  Mr KEMBLE  WOMEN  MALVINA  Mrs SIDDONS

wretch  Fate hovers o'er thy head Another blow  Thou worse than savage sinks thee to the tomb  And yet too honourably would'st thou fall  Enter  MINLA  ERRAGON  Nay gentle lady start not there's no danger  Selfpreservation drew my vengeance down  On yon relentless ruffian who in scorn  Of hospitality's most sacred laws  Assail'd a shipwreck'd stranger My sword's sheath'd  And thou behold'st a suppliant who intreats  To know upon what shore a storm hath cast him  And of whose charity he may implore  Mere sustenance for life  MINLA  Thy desperate act  Strikes me with terror and didst thou conceive  Thy danger thee alike would terrify  But hard necessity that breaks all bounds  Extenuates all offence I mourn thy lot  And my heart longs to lighten what it mourns  Know then poor stranger that this northern part  Of Caledonia ridged with rocky hills  Is Morven called where Connal rules supreme  In Selma's royal palace  ERRAGON  Connal  MINLA  Connal  Whose father's sepulchre thou there behold'st  The venerable Oscar  ERRAGON  Tell me yet  MINLA  Nay risk no further parley Whence thou comest  I know not If from Lochlin as thy vest  And helmet seem to note fly hence with speed  Whilst flight is in thy power The storm that wrecked thee  Is not more merciless than Morven's king  To every wretch from thence Oh then be warned  ERRAGON  Thanks gracious ladyYet an outcast here  Roving o'er pathless wilds may hardly hope  The like fair courtesy he finds in thee  MINLA  The rivulet winding round yon shrubclad hill  Close by a cave within a rifted rock  Will lead thy steps whose tenant should'st thou mention  The name of Minla will with food supply thee  And friendly shelter till thou ventur'st forth  In midnight's mantle shrouded  ERRAGON  For such grace  Spirits of goodness ever be thy guides  And fortune thy companion  Exit  MINLA  Oh how sorely  Mischance lets fall her hand on this poor sufferer  To a wide world exposed Well may it fare  And prosperously with thee Whence that noise  He is beset Yon baffled ruffian heads  A lawless band and down the hollow glen  They follow fast upon him Hapless man  Thy days in this inhospitable land  I fear are number'dMine may number more  But am I therein happier Ah Malvina  I come to mourn thy lot from him who feels  An interest there too tender for my peace  Thy Everallin On me wretched woman  Colder of comfort than the north wind blows  Falls every chilling glance Yet my heart still  Loves thee Malvina and my faithful tongue  Shall his kind message bear  A Door opening discovers  MALVINA  kneeling at a Sepulchre Her  VIRGIN  advances  VIRGIN  What plaintive sounds  Break on the silence of this aweful dome  Was't Minla's voice I heard  MINLA  Led by my love  I with Malvina came to sympathize  VIRGIN  Lo where she kneels  MINLA  How motionlessah me  That bursting groan  MALVINA  Hear venerable Oscar  Whom every sorrowing heart in Selma mourns  But chiefly thy sad captive From the grave  Hear and thy son's licentious passion quell  Which hourly wounds her spirit whom from bondage  Thy gracious goodness promised to release  Quell it or let this marble monument  Unfold and swallow me  MINLA  My bleeding heart  Can bear no longerdearest lady  MALVINA  Minla  MINLA  Is't of necessity thy soul should heave  Th' eternal sigh ah must Malvina live  Interr'd within the tomb  MALVINA  This tomb's my altar  Th' asylum a dead father lends my virtue  Against a bold bad son the sole resource  Of wretchedness which hope itself forsakes  MINLA  Give to the winds these bodings of despair  MALVINA  Ye towers of Selma and thou mournful flood  Strumon whose sullen waves gloom round the rock  Oft have you heard my anguish heard me weep  To the pale midnight moon th' intestine broils  That from my country drove me on the seas  Where with brute rage this royal plunderer  Boarded and sunk my bark but not the loss  Of country not captivity itself  With its worst horrors Connal's hateful passion  Have power to break this heart  MINLA  My errand will not  I fear bring comfort kindly as it comes  From the king's brother  MALVINA  Generous Everallin  Oh how unlike that king next thee my Minla  My best support whose consolation oft  Has quieted this conflict  MINLA  Now no words  He sends of consolation to Malvina  Dark doubts instead and dismal apprehensions  Now he forewarns thee to beware the worst  For he suspects the worst A sudden call  T' attend the king prevented his approach  And he intreats thee not to quit this tomb  Thy safest sanctuary  MALVINA  What sanctuary  Is safe from such a king he'll force me hence  MINLA  His fears won't suffer him Th' incensed people  T' avert th' impending curse would headlong hurl  The tyrant from his throne who dared such outrage  On a sepulchral monument Be this  Malvina's comfort  MALVINA  For me there's no comfort  Ye waves that bore me towards a friendly port  Ah wherefore were you not that hour my grave  Death I with transport would have clasped to 'scape  That monster's loathed love Oh my kind Minla  If there's a wretch forlorn of every hope  Who calls on cruel powers of earth and air  And longs to give up life tell her my tale  And she'll forget to weep her lighter lot  MINLA  Grief loves to dwell upon the gloomier side  Still darkening each distress The king thou know'st  With awful reverence my sire reveres  Th' instructor of his youth and how my sire  Venerates Malvina's virtues her own heart  Wants not my testimony  MALVINA  Good Hidallan  Might friendship's sage and salutary counsel  Afford protection I were safe in thine  But three long days have past without his presence  The king perhaps forbids him to approach  Thee he may next forbid Oh ere that hour  Thou righteous father of an impious son  Spirit of Oscar take me  She retires to the tomb  MINLA  Go not back  To thy own tomb alas these bursts of woe  Too surely will dispatch thee  Enter  HIDALLAN  MINLA  Timely com'st thou  My honoured sire see where the livelong day  Pondering she sits oe'r the lone sepulchre  Must her sad tears for ever ever flow  HIDALLAN  I'm not familiar with the powers of fate  To say how long but without cause my child  Th' unhappy mourner weeps not  MINLA  The king cannot  Bold as he is profane his father's tomb  HIDALLAN  Who shall restrain him what he will he can  And what licentious love may urge his will  To perpetrate who knows  MINLA  But lives there not  Sure I have heard my father say there lives  A spark of fire ethereal in the breast  That makes the spirit shrink appalled at guilt  HIDALLAN  Such fire diffused through nature I believe  But dormant and inactive it awakes not  At every slight rebuke the blow must be  Of force that strikes it from a hardened heart  MINLA  And who so fit with forcible effect  To strike it as Hidallan yes the duty  Due to his sage preceptor  HIDALLAN  Ah my Minla  Little will that avail his towering passions  Bear all before them down with sovereign sway  Disdainful of controll  MALVINA  returns from the tomb  MALVINA  That wellknown voice  With soothing sound recalls me from the tomb  Thy gracious visit what may it import  Oh say what to this house of horror draws  The venerable Hidallan  HIDALLAN  That sweet aspect  Those gentle graces lady which the gales  Of grief scarce ruffle nay thy grief itself  So lovely in the looks of innocence  These charming mourner as they oft have drawn  Might hither draw me nowBut ah they do not  The king  MALVINA  My boding bosom  MINLA  Speak oh speak  MALVINA  Something not to be spoken he hath heard  I would not hear it Ah I dare not hear  What like the thunderbolt would strike me dead  But would it strike me dead how joyfully  On the dread tidings should I then repose  As on the bosom of an only friend  My weary soul to rest  HIDALLAN  The king Malvina  Has order'd my attendance at the tomb  Something untoward has chanced The darken'd moon  'Mongst meteors of the night looks not more gloomy  Than Connal 'mongst his chiefs The cause I know not  Nor could he well express But sure his breast  Like ocean's in the last night's hurricane  Is tost with tumult  MALVINA  Ceaseless may it toss  Yes let his guilt the horror of his guilt  Become my dread avenger 'tis the lash  Of conscience from the power within the soul  HIDALLAN  Yet lady listen Suddenly he called  A council then forbade and then recalled it  Abruptly from the hall he broke away  At once returning as abruptly back  He bade me wait him here Then starting cried  Malvina shall be mine  MALVINA  The monster his  Shall I be his ye ministering powers of air  Who on your dim clouds riding saw the robber  In the dread moment I became his captive  Plunge in my father's breast his murd'rous sword  And whelm him in the waves  HIDALLAN  Unhappy lady  Ne'er did the tidings of that tragic tale  Reach me till now  MALVINA  The tyrant knows it not  Nor to this hour suspects he who I am  But as thou art too generous good Hidallan  To shrink from Virtue's side howe'er oppressed  Let not the midnight ruffian twice attempt  To violate my honour Oh prevent  Our mortal meeting  HIDALLAN  He approaches quell  If possible this glow of vehemence  Enter  CONNAL  CONNAL  Where are thy smiles Malvina those soft smiles  And winning graces beauty wears t'allure  The eye of adoration Sullen fair  To lift thee to a lucid orb I came  And make thee the world's gaze Whence then those glances  Of cold disdain Why trembles thy whole frame  MALVINA  And wonder'st thou that innocence should tremble  Wonder that it should look on thee and live  On thee whose words like pestilential vapours  Strike all that's good and virtuous  CONNAL  Proud woman  Whom a king's courtesy but makes more proud  This thy return my chiefs I had informed  to  Hidalla  Would'st thou believe that she should be my queen  The feast of shells is spread and thro' the hall  To the sweet voice of fair Malvina's praise  A hundred harps are heard I meant Hidallan  Spite of revolting royalty I meant  This evening sun should see me wed my slave  MALVINA  Let let it not behold th' unseemly sight  Not see your royalty abased so low  No for some nobler head reserve your crown  Some nobler heart  CONNAL  Presumptuous  MALVINA  Scorn reject me  I ask no honours I no peace can feel  Till far from Morvan  CONNAL  And from Morvan far  Back to thy native nothing should'st thou go  But that my pride forbids In thy own spite  Thou shalt be mine Prepare the nuptial rites  MALVINA  If ever pity touched thee  CONNAL  Am I heard  MALVINA  The loss of liberty the drops of anguish  Wrung from a bleeding heart I pardon thee  He heeds me not inhumanThen to thee  Spirit of Loda my sole guardian now  Bursts my sad soul if at thy stone of power  I've bent with reverent awe in clouded thunder  Rise terrible shade and from the monster's grasp  Save save thy Erragon's distracted wife  CONNAL  The wife of Erragon recall thy words  MALVINA  Impossible Here here they're registered  Never to be erazed  CONNAL  The prince of Sora  My mortal foe from whence what country com'st thou  MALVINA  From Inistone  CONNAL  Confusion art thou then  Daughter of that proud chief who rules the isle  Morla who leagues with Sora's haughty prince  Against my kingdom  MALVINA  Morla was my father  Who died Barbarian by the bloody sword  That made me captive  CONNAL  Said'st thou did he bow  His haughty crest to me thy Erragon  Had he been there had shrunk too but his pride  Shall feel a different downfall  MINLA  Ah she faints  Beneath the conflict  Enter

sacrifice for all the blood they've drawn  From Caledonia's sons  Exit Officer  MINLA  Oh quickly summon  Thy utmost powers for thou need'st all Malvina  At this distressful hour  CONNAL  Mark me Hidallan  Most heedfully before the waning moon  Darkens behind Carthmona's tower give notice  That every rite is done I've spoke dispatch  Exit  Hid  Meantime do thou with smiles of love proud woman  Prepare thee for the nuptials  Exit  CONNAL  MALVINA  Heard'st thou that  With smiles of love prepare me for his nuptials  Diseases rather let me wed and love  The terriblest distress  MINLA  My anxious spirits  That vainly would lend comfort dread the worst  Wretches like him go on from guilt to guilt  Till scornful malice laughs at at all remorse  MALVINA  Minla their laugh's a lie they're cowards here  Inward misgivings gnaw the ulcer'd heart  These are the fiends that in distracted slumbers  At midnight haunt the man of murder These  Th' infernal torches flaring in his face  Prepare me for his nuptials No I've sworn  MINLA  He knows his power opposeless  MALVINA  Dreams he so  Yet woes wrought up to this stupendous height  May chance to make him shrink  MINLA  That fearful smile  The tumult of a tortured spirit speaks  Like the red flame of lightning that unfolds  The troubled breast of heaven  MALVINA  Fast as thy love  Will speed thee my kind Minla to his brother  Haste and intreat his presence  MINLA  Everallin's  MALVINA  Instantly at his father's sepulchre  MINLA  Yes I obey your bidding  Exit  MALVINA  Yet alas  How ineffectual every human aid  The foreign vessel driven last night on shore  Gave me some glimmering hope of an escape  But Erin brings no tidings of its fate  Or destinationMine comes on apace  My marriage now is known This dire extreme  Alone could pluck the secret from my breast  For like the grave the tyrant hates my lord  Yet am I still his wife living or dead  But my heart bodes unable to survive  His country's loss and oh the loss of me  He followed my poor father and now lies  Buried alas within the billowy deep  Unseen unknown No bard shall chant his fate  No mossy stone shall rise in his renown  Oh miserable thought Must I then live  Of both bereft Husband and father both  This tyrant dearest Erragon shall he  Wed thy loved wife my father's murderer  Pollute his daughter's bed No blessed shades  But how preventhas poison lost its power  Or yon steep crag that headlong overhangs  Th' unsathom'd flood  Enter  ERIN  MALVINA  Oh Erin art thou come  Hast thou enquired the state of those poor wretches  Cast on the shore their vessel will it again  Venture upon its voyage  ERIN  'Tis dashed in pieces  MALVINA  Then farewel every hope of an escape  Oh I'm the sport of fortune  ERIN  All the crew  Ill fated men are prisoners He who found  Shelter in yonder cave beside the cliff  Within this hour was seiz'd and must abide  The lot of all from Lochlin  MALVINA  Lochlin came  The ship from Lochlin What's the prisoner's name  ERIN  His name I could not learntheir chief no doubt  For gallantly 'gainst numbers did he fight  Of some note too and rank for 'mid th' encounter  Struck from his head a burnish'd helmet fell  Studded with four large gems and bold in front  Towers a young eagle in embroidered gold  MALVINA  Flyfetch itkneel intreat them for a moment  To trust it hither  Exit  ERIN  Should it prove my gift  My soul dies in my bosom at the thought  Just such a helmet with an eagle's form  Broidered in gold the work of my own hands  Bright emblem of himself when he went forth  To deal his vengeance on the rebel hosts  I gave to Erragon my best beloved  Should it prove thatOh this suspence is death  Yonder's the cave Fate drives me on I'll see it  Though the dread sight should turn me

stranger  VIRGIN  The most prudent cannot  Guard against all mischance  ERIN  The clifted cave  Scarce had I reach'd when she with breathless haste  Before me rushed At once she saw she seized  The helmet and the sword the sight whereof  Struck like a basilisk her starting eye  But when she heard the stranger was born off  To suffer with the victims oh what words  Have power to paint the agony the frenzy  With which she bounded after him  VIRGIN  On the instant  You should have followed should have forced her back  From that inhuman scenebut Minla comes  We must not now be questioned of Malvina  Exeunt  Enter  MINLA  MINLA  The prince approaches and my fluttering heart  Bounds but not with delight Oh jealousy  That with one glance turn'st friendship to a thread  Touched by a flaming brand hence from my breast  It will not hence and all Malvina's charms  Dart their envenomed stings into my soul  She's the bright star that darkens my dim light  Yet yet she cannot Everallin wed  Her Erragon aliveshould he be dead  I'll enter to avoid the horrid thought  And be the harbinger of my own fate  Exit  Enter  EVERALLIN  EVERALLIN  Whence this tumultuous glow as I advance  A sepulchre should gloomier thoughts inspire  Thoughts cold and comfortless Divine Malvina  Thy summons thy dear summons is the charm  That fires th' exulting soul of Everallin  Who would not woo such gentle vassalage  Lighter than liberty are love's soft links  That fasten soul to soul And then so pure  So perfect is her life that every mortal  Goes mended from her presence  MINLA  enters  EVERALLIN  Wherefore trembles  Minla with such emotion where's Malvina  MINLA  Ah where indeed The mountaincave I've search'd▪  And where the seafowl make their lonely haunt  Close by the lake Malvina is not

hapless woman  Unfriended and unguarded her own fears  Would at the tomb confine her Should the king  With desperate hand have hurried her away  But no each guardian spirit would interpose  Minla no

with music's melting notes  ODE  I  Sweet tenant of the tomb  Who on thy snowwhite arm reclined  Sit'st heark'ning to the hollow wind  Ah why in youth's gay bloom  Shroud that fair form which might display  New graces to the golden day  In this sepulchral gloom  II  Music's enchanting lyre  Of power t' unbind the midnight spell  Or souls in savages that dwell  To melt with soft desire  She heeds not From your cloud above  Burst then some spirit who died of love  And flash th' allquick'ning fire  III  Oh flash it through the gloom  Of her chill bosom Let her feel  The wound her smiles alone can heal  Then warm in youth's gay bloom  With fluttering heart and melting eye  To light and love and Connal fly  Sweet tenant of the tomb  CONNAL  Enough you may retire  Exeunt Bards  I'll enter now

frenzy's this  Hither I came to meet her  MINLA  Oh she's gone  CONNAL  Gone whither is it thy conspiracy  Or thine presumptuous youth who lov'st to cross  Thy sovereign and shalt feel the vengeance due  To such rash insolence  MINLA  Blameless alas  And ignorant of this unhappy chance  Stand both of usHero at her own request  I left her with dread doubts accompanied  Fears and alarms that with tumultuous rage  Shook her distracted mind  EVERALLIN  And who shall say  Whither they might transport her o'er the wild  And desart heath or down yon desperate rock  Into the roaring waves  CONNAL  Thy boding spirit  Imaginary terrors conjures up  Far off she cannot be Round let them search  Caverns and mountainstreams  MINLA  Whereever found  I fear some dire disaster Her high mind  Into th' extreme was hurried  Enter  HIDALLAN  MINLA  Ah that look  Of consternation what may it portend  HIDALLAN  A tale of horror Miserable Malvina  So late the general wonder is become  The melancholy ruin of herself  Her reasoning powers quite lost  EVERALLIN  Distracting sounds  CONNAL  Unfold at once old man  HIDALLAN  Still doth she stand  Before my frighted fancy I still see her  As the last victim bled beneath the sword  Rush on the altar Starting from her head  Streamed her loose hair and round she cast her eyes  With frantic glareWhere is he Lead she cried  Lead me to Erragon my life my lord  My murder'd Erragon then struck her breast  And down with anguish dropt To her apartment  They raised and bore her off  EVERALLIN  Again behold her  Pale and in wild disorder  Enter  MALVINA  with

Of counterfeited madness is thy plot  And each suspicious symptom  EVERALLIN  If a life  Of friendly freedom and fraternal love  Unsullied thy suspicion will not check  My soul scorns further proof  HIDALLAN  Forbear forbear  EVERALLIN  Forbearance urge to him who would provoke  Patience itself past sufferance  HIDALLAN  Such contention  'Tween brothers who by Nature's tend'rest ties  Of love

affects to be  Not to discern it  EVRALLIN  That her fears are false  As an unreal vision I not doubt  Your hands are guiltless of her husband's blood  Yet what she wildly raves her heart believes  Your pity then she merits not your wrath  Her nuptials caused the frenzy  CONNAL  Still presume▪  Thy arrogance be gone  EVRALLIN  Yet shalt thou hear  Honor though banished from the world beside  Still in the hearts of princes should have place  And this unkingly this unfilial breach  Of a dead father's promise makes me shrink  In presence of that tombThe majesty  Of buried Morven frowns before my view  His hollow voice groans forth Malvina's name  I feel the awful sound Here like a spirit  It swells within my breast like Oscar's Spirit  Which while the memory of his promise lives  Spite of a brother's or a tyrant's threat  Shall prove me Oscar's son  Exit  CONNAL  Upon thy life  No more behold MalvinaCurse upon  This womanish folly What the more her pride  Should damp love's flame the fiercer shall it blaze  Where are thy arts to exorcise this fiend  to  Hidallan  To dim those eyes whose quick'ning fires might strike  A genial spring through winter's frozen breast  Hidallan every word from those dear lips  Raps me above myself and one kind smile  Would make my life immortal  HIDALLAN  Ah beware  These sudden transports of intemperate passion  They're flashes from black clouds and the more fierce  Th' effulgence that bursts from them the more fearful  The dismal gloom that follows Would you hope  To bring back peace of mind release Malvina  She never will be yours  CONNAL  She shall be mine  Therefore devise some instant meansabout it  There's not a look or voice but thwarts my will  Better rule o'er the eagle  of the cliff  Or wolves that ravage 'mong the forestoaks  Wild nature's commoners than be such a king  Well hast thou yet bethought thee  HIDALLAN  Every thought  Confirms my former counsel Human laws  And laws within the soul with one dread voice  Bid you release Malvina  CONNAL  O'er my youth  A careless temper gives thee an ascendant  And thou presum'st upon it Hence to this woman  Who listens to thy voice and back return  With welcome

Thy savage thirst for human blood I know  CONNAL  Art thou so bold thy blood indeed is forfeit  But yet the power of life as well as death  Rests in our hands It may be there are means  By which thou

Esq  Spoken by Mrs SIDDONS  AT length our bark has reached the wishedfor shore  The winds are hush'dbut is all danger o'er  The trembling bard still hovers o'er the main  Still dreads the dancing waves that lash in vain  Clings like th'affrighted sailor to the mast  And shudders at the dangers he has past  Dangers indeedfor who in times like these  Would launch his ship to plough dramatic seas  Where growling thunders roll and tempests sweep  Such crouds of bold adventurers to the deep  O'er his poor head the winds of malice blow  And waves of angry censure rage below  Critics like monsters on each side appear  Herald  the whale and shark the  Gazetteer    If these he chance t' escape there comes a squall  From  Lloyd's St James's London  or  Whitehall  Here  Chronicle  like Scylla guards the coast  There foams Charybdisin the  Morning Post  Mark how they break his rudder cut his cable  Tear up plan diction sentiment and fable  Their order isan order they enjoy  To seize to burn to sink and to destroy  What wonderous chance our author should survive  That in such boisterous seas his bark's alive  But fond Ambition led the bard along  And Syren Muses tempted with a song  Fame like another Circe beck'ning stood  Waved her fair hand and bade him brave the flood  Who could resist when thus she shewed her charms  Soothed his fond hopes and wooed him to her arms  Halfrigg'd half mann'd and leaky as you find  He tricked his frigate out and brav'd the wind  Your partial favour still may swell his sails  And fill his vessel with propitious gales  Though peppered with small shot and tempest tossed  You still may land him on this golden coast  Convinced that those the surest path pursue  Who trust their  all  to candour and to you  FINIS
