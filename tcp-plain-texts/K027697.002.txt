 THE LIFE AND OPINIONS OF TRISTRAM SHANDY GENTLEMAN  VOL II  The SECOND EDITION  LONDON Printed for R and J DODSLEY in  PallMall  MDCCLX  THE LIFE and OPINIONS OF TRISTRAM SHANDY Gent  CHAP I  I Have begun a new book on purpose that I might have room enough to explain the nature of the perplexities in which my uncle  Toby  was involved from the many discourses and interrogations about the siege of  Namur  where he received his wound  I must remind the reader in case he has read the history of King  William  's  warsbut if he has notI then inform him that one of the most memorable attacks in that siege was that which was made by the  English  and  Dutch  upon the point of the advanced counterscarp before the gate of  St Nicolas  which inclosed the great sluice or waterstop where the  English  were terribly exposed to the shot of the counterguard and demibastion of  St Roch  The issue of which hot dispute in three words was this That the  Dutch  lodged themselves upon the counterguardand that the  English  made themselves masters of the covered way before  St Nicolas  's gate notwithstanding the gallantry of the  French  officers who exposed themselves upon the glacis sword in hand  As this was the principal attack of which my uncle  Toby  was an eyewitness  at  Namur  the army of the besiegers being cut off by the confluence of the  Maes  and  Sambre  from seeing much of each other's operationsmy uncle  Toby  was generally more eloquent and particular in his account of it and the many perplexities he was in arose out of the almost insurmountable difficulties he found in telling his story intelligibly and giving such clear ideas of the differences and distinctions between the scarp and counterscarpthe glacis and covered waythe halfmoon and ravelinas to make his company fully comprehend where and what he was about  Writers themselves are too apt to confound these termsso that you will the less wonder if in his endeavours to explain them and in opposition to many  misconceptions that my uncle  Toby  did oft times puzzle his visiters and sometimes himself too  To speak the truth unless the company my father led up stairs were tolerably clearheaded or my uncle  Toby  was in one of his best explanatory moods 'twas a difficult thing do what he could to keep the discourse free from obscurity  What rendered the account of this affair the more intricate to my uncle  Toby  was thisthat in the attack of the counterscarp before the gate of  St Nicolas  extending itself from the bank of the  Maes  quite up to the great waterstopthe ground was cut and crosscut with such a multitude of dykes drains rivulets and sluices on all sidesand he would get so sadly bewilder'd and set  fast amongst them that frequently he could neither get backwards or forwards to save his life and was oft times obliged to give up the attack upon that very account only  These perplexing rebuffs gave my uncle  Toby Shandy  more perturbations than you would imagine and as my father's kindness to him was continually dragging up fresh friends and fresh inquirershe had but a very uneasy task of it  No doubt my uncle  Toby  had great command of himselfand could guard appearances I believe as well as most menyet any one may imagine that when he could not retreat out of the ravelin without getting into the halfmoon or get out of the covered way without  falling down the counterscarp nor cross the dyke without danger of slipping into the ditch but that he must have fretted and fumed inwardlyHe did soand these little and hourly vexations which may seem trifling and of no account to the man who has not read  Hippocrates  yet whoever has read  Hippocrates  or Dr  James Mackenzie  and has considered well the effects which the passions and affections of the mind have upon the digestionWhy not of a wound as well as of a dinnermay easily conceive what sharp paroxisms and exacerbations of his wound my uncle  Toby  must have undergone upon that score only  My uncle  Toby  could not philosophize upon it'twas enough he felt it was soand having sustained the pain and sorrows of it for three months together  he was resolved some way or other to extricate himself  He was one morning lying upon his back in his bed the anguish and nature of the wound upon his groin suffering him to lye in no other position when a thought came into his head that if he could purchase such a thing and have it pasted down upon a board as a large map of the fortifications of the town and citadel of  Namur  with its environs it might be a means of giving him easeI take notice of his desire to have the environs along with the town and citadel for this reasonbecause my uncle  Toby  's wound was got in one of the traverses about thirty toises from the returning angle of the trench opposite to the salient angle of the demibastion of  St Roch  so that he was pretty confident  he could stick a pin upon the identical spot of ground where he was standing in when the stone struck him  All this succeeded to his wishes and not only freed him from a world of sad explanations but in the end it prov'd the happy means as you will read of procuring my uncle  Toby  his HOBBYHORSE  CHAP II  THERE is nothing so foolish when you are at the expence of making an entertainment of this kind as to order things so badly as to let your criticks and gentry of refined taste run it down Nor is there any thing so likely  to make them do it as that of leaving them out of the party or what is full as offensive of bestowing your attention upon the rest of your guests in so particular a way as if there was no such thing as a critick by occupation at table  I guard against both for in the first place I have left half a dozen places purposely open for themand in the next place I pay them all courtGentlemen I kiss your handsI protest no company could give me half the pleasureby my soul I am glad to see youI beg only you will make no strangers of yourselves but sit down without any ceremony and fall on heartily  I said I had left six places and I was upon the point of carrying my complaisance so far as to have left a seventh open for themand in this very spot I stand onbut being told by a critick tho' not by occupationbut by nature that I had acquitted myself well enough I shall fill it up directly hoping in the mean time that I shall be able to make a great deal of more room next year  How in the name of wonder could your uncle  Toby  who it seems was a military man and whom you have represented as no foolbe at the same time such a confused puddingheaded muddleheaded fellow asGo look  So Sir Critick I could have replied but I scorn it'Tis language unurbaneand only befitting the man  who cannot give clear and satisfactory accounts of things or dive deep enough into the first causes of human ignorance and confusion It is moreover the reply valiantand therefore I reject it for tho' it might have suited my uncle  Toby  's character as a soldier excellently welland had he not accustomed himself in such attacks to whistle the  Lillabullero  as he wanted no courage 'tis the very answer he would have given yet it would by no means have done for me You see as plain as can be that I write as a man of eruditionthat even my similies my allusions my illustrations my metaphors are eruditeand that I must sustain my character properly and contrast it properly tooelse what would become of me Why Sir I should be undoneat this very moment that I am going here to fill up one  place against a critickI should have made an opening for a couple  Therefore I answer thus  Pray Sir in all the reading which you have ever read did you ever read such a book as  Locke  's Essay upon the Human UnderstandingDon't answer me rashlybecause many I know quote the book who have not read itand many have read it who understand it notIf either of these is your case as I write to instruct I will tell you in three words what the book isIt is a historyA history of who what where when Don't hurry yourselfIt is a historybook Sir which may possibly recommend it to the world of what passes in a man's own mind and if you will say so much of the book and no more believe  me you will cut no contemptible figure in a metaphysic circle  But this by the way  Now if you will venture to go along with me and look down into the bottom of this matter it will be found that the cause of obscurity and confusion in the mind of man is threefold  Dull organs dear Sir in the first place Secondly slight and transient impressions made by objects when the said organs are not dull And thirdly a memory like unto a sieve not able to retain what it has receivedCall down  Dolly  your chambermaid and I will give you my cap and bell along with it if I make not this matter so plain that  Dolly  herself shall understand it as well as  Malbranch    When  Dolly  has indited her epistle to  Robin  and has thrust her arm into the bottom of her pocket hanging by her rightsidetake that opportunity to recollect that the organs and faculties of perception can by nothing in this world be so aptly typified and explained as by that one thing which  Dolly  's hand is in search ofYour organs are not so dull that I should inform you'tis an inch Sir of red sealwax  When this is melted and dropped upon the letter if  Dolly  fumbles too long for her thimble till the wax is over harden'd it will not receive the mark of her thimble from the usual impulse which was wont to imprint it Very well If  Dolly  's wax for want of better is beeswax or of a temper too softtho' it may receiveit will not hold the impression  how hard soever  Dolly  thrusts against it and last of all supposing the wax good and eke the thimble but applied thereto in careless haste as her Mistress rings the bellin any one of these three cases the print left by the thimble will be as unlike the prototype as a brassjack  Now you must understand that not one of these was the true cause of the confusion in my uncle  Toby  's discourse and it is for that very reason I enlarge upon them so long after the manner of great physiologiststo shew the world what it did  not  arise from  What it did arise from I have hinted above and a fertile source of obscurity it isand ever will beand that is the unsteady uses of words which have perplexed  the clearest and most exalted understandings  It is ten to one at  Arthur  's whether you have ever read the literary histories of past agesif you havewhat terrible battles 'yclept logomachies have they occasioned and perpetuated with so much gall and inkshedthat a good natured man cannot read the accounts of them without tears in his eyes  Gentle critick when thou hast weigh'd all this and consider'd within thyself how much of thy own knowledge discourse and conversation has been pestered and disordered at one time or other by this and this onlyWhat a pudder and racket in COUNCILS about  and  and in the SCHOOLS of the learned about power and about spiritabout  essences and about quintessencesabout substances and about spaceWhat confusion in greater THEATRES from words of little meaning and as indeterminate a sensewhen thou considers this thou wilt not wonder at my uncle  Toby  's perplexitiesthou wilt drop a tear of pity upon his scarp and his counterscarphis glacis and his coveredwayhis ravelin and his halfmoon 'Twas not by ideasby heaven his life was put in jeopardy by words  CHAP III  WHEN my uncle  Toby  got his map of  Namur  to his mind he began immediately to apply himself and with the utmost diligence to the study of it for nothing being of more importance  to him than his recovery and his recovery depending as you have read upon the passions and affections of his mind it behoved him to take the nicest care to make himself so far master of his subject as to be able to talk upon it without emotion  In a fortnight's close and painful application which by the bye did my uncle  Toby  's wound upon his groin no goodhe was enabled by the help of some marginal documents at the feet of the elephant together with  Gobesius  's military architecture and pyroballogy translated from the  Flemish  to form his discourse with passable perspicuity and before he was two full months gonehe was right eloquent upon it and could make not only the attack of the advanced  counterscarp with great orderbut having by that time gone much deeper into the art than what his first motive made necessarymy uncle  Toby  was able to cross the  Maes  and  Sambre  make diversions as far as  Vauban  's line the abbey of  Salsines    c  and give his visiters as distinct a history of each of their attacks as of that of the gate of  St Nicolas  where he had the honour to receive his wound  But the desire of knowledge like the thirst of riches increases ever with the acquisition of it The more my uncle  Toby  pored over his map the more he took a liking to itby the same process and electrical assimilation as I told you thro' which I ween the souls of connoisseurs themselves by long friction and incumbition have the happiness at length to  get all bevirtu'dbepictur'dbebutterflied and befiddled  The more my uncle  Toby  drank of this sweet fountain of science the greater was the heat and impatience of his thirst so that before the first year of his confinement had well gone round there was scarce a fortified town in  Italy  or  Flanders  of which by one means or other he had not procured a plan reading over as he got them and carefully collating therewith the histories of their sieges their demolitions their improvements and new works all which he would read with that intense application and delight that he would forget himself his wound his confinement his dinner  In the second year my uncle  Toby  purchased  Ramelli  and  Cataneo  translated  from the  Italian  likewise  Stevinus    Marolis  the Chevalier  de Ville    Lorini    Cochorn    Sheeter  the Count  de Pagan  the Marshal  Vauban  Mons  Blondel  with almost as many more books of military architecture as Don  Quixote  was found to have of chivalry when the curate and barber invaded his library  Towards the beginning of the third year which was in  August  ninetynine my uncle  Toby  found it necessary to understand a little of projectilesAnd having judged it best to draw his knowledge from the fountainhead he began with  N Tartaglia  who it seems was the first man who detected the imposition of a canonball's doing all that mischief under the notion of a right lineThis  N Tartaglia  proved to my uncle  Toby  to be an impossible thing  Endless is the Search of Truth  No sooner was my uncle  Toby  satisfied which road the cannonball did not go but he was insensibly led on and resolved in his mind to enquire and find out which road the ball did go For which purpose he was obliged to set off afresh with old  Maltus  and studied him devoutlyHe proceeded next to  Gallileo  and  Torricellius  wherein by certain geometrical rules infallibly laid down he found the precise path to be a PARABOLAor else an HYPERBOLAand that the parameter or  latus rectum  of the conic section of the said path was to the quantity and amplitude in a direct  ratio  as the whole line to the sine of double the angle of incidence form'd by the breech upon an horizontal planeand that the semiparameter  stop my dear uncle  Toby  stopgo not one foot further into this thorny and bewilder'd trackintricate are the steps intricate are the mases of this labyrinth intricate are the troubles which the pursuit of this bewitching phantom KNOWLEDGE will bring upon theeO my uncle flyflyfly from it as from a serpentIs it fit goodnatur'd man thou should'st fit up with the wound upon thy groin whole nights baking thy blood with hectic watchingsAlas 'twill exasperate thy symptomscheck thy perspirationsevaporate thy spiritswaste thy animal strengthdry up thy radical moisturebring thee into a costive habit of body impair thy healthand hasten all the infirmities of thy old ageO my uncle my uncle  Toby  CHAP IV  I Would not give a groat for that man's knowledge in pencraft who does not understand thisThat the best plain narrative in the world tack'd very close to the last spirited apostrophe to my uncle  Toby  would have felt both cold and vapid upon the reader's palatetherefore I forthwith put an end to the chapterthough I was in the middle of my story  Writers of my stamp have one principle in common with paintersWhere an exact copying makes our pictures less striking we choose the less evil deeming it even more pardonable to trespass against truth than beautyThis is to be understood  cum grano salis    but be it as it willas the parallel is made more for the sake of letting the apostrophe cool than any thing else'tis not very material whether upon any other score the reader approves of it or not  In the latter end of the third year my uncle  Toby  perceiving that the parameter and semiparameter of the conic section angered his wound he left off the study of projectiles in a kind of a huff and betook himself to the practical part of fortification only the pleasure of which like a spring held back returned upon him with redoubled force  It was in this year that my uncle began to break in upon the daily regularity of a clean shirtto dismiss his barber unshavenand to allow his surgeon  scarce time sufficient to dress his wound concerning himself so little about it as not to ask him once in seven times dressing how it went on When loall of a sudden for the change was as quick as lightening he began to sigh heavily for his recoverycomplain'd to my father grew impatient with the surgeonand one morning as he heard his foot coming up stairs he shut up his books and thrust aside his instruments in order to expostulate with him upon the protraction of his cure which he told him might surely have been accomplished at least by that timeHe dwelt long upon the miseries he had undergone and the sorrows of his four years melancholy imprisonmentadding that had it not been for the kind looks and fraternal chearings of the best of brothershe had long since sunk under his misfortunes  My father was by My uncle  Toby  's eloquence brought tears into his eyes'twas unexpectedMy uncle  Toby  by nature was not eloquentit had the greater effectThe surgeon was confoundednot that there wanted grounds for such or greater marks of impatiencebut 'twas unexpected too in the four years he had attended him he had never seen any thing like it in my uncle  Toby  's carriagehe had never once dropp'd one fretful or discontented wordhe had been all patienceall submission  We ose the right of complaining sometimes by forbearing itbut we oftner treble the forceThe surgeon was astonishedbut much more so when he heard my uncle  Toby  go on and peremptorily insist upon his healing up  the wound directlyor sending for Monsieur  Ronjat  the King's SerjeantSurgeon to do it for him  The desire of life and health is implanted in man's naturethe love of liberty and enlargement is a sisterpassion to it These my uncle  Toby  had in common with his speciesand either of them had been sufficient to account for his earnest desire to get well and out of doorsbut I have told you before that nothing wrought with our family after the common wayand from the time and manner in which this eager desire shew'd itself in the present case the penetrating reader will suspect there was some other cause or crotchet for it in my uncle  Toby  's headThere was so and 'tis the subject of the next chapter to set forth what that cause and crotchet was  I own when that's done 'twill be time to return back to the parlour fireside where we left my uncle  Toby  in the middle of his sentence  CHAP V  WHEN a man gives himself up to the government of a ruling passionor in other words when his HOBBYHORSE grows headstrongfarewell cool reason and fair discretion  My uncle  Toby  's wound was near well and as soon as the surgeon recovered his surprize and could get leave to say as muchhe told him 'twas just beginning to incarnate and that if no fresh exfoliation happen'd which there was no signs ofit would be dried up in five or six  weeks The sound of as many olympiads twelve hours before would have convey'd an idea of shorter duration to my uncle  Toby  's mindThe succession of his ideas was now rapidhe broil'd with impatience to put his design in executionand so without consulting further with any soul livingwhich by the bye I think is right when you are predetermined to take no one soul's advicehe privately ordered  Trim  his man to pack up a bundle of lint and dressings and hire a chariot and four to be at the door exactly by twelve o'clock that day when he knew my father would be upon 'ChangeSo leaving a banknote upon the table for the surgeon's care of him and a letter of tender thanks for his brother'she pack'd up his maps his books of fortification his instruments  c  and by the help of a  crutch on one side and  Trim  on the othermy uncle  Toby  embark'd for  ShandyHall  The reason or rather the rise of this sudden demigration was as follows  The table in my uncle  Toby  's room and at which the night before this change happened he was sitting with his maps  c  about himbeing somewhat of the smallest for that infinity of great and small instruments of knowledge which usually lay crouded upon ithe had the accident in reaching over for his tobaccobox to throw down his compasses and in stooping to take the compasses up with his sleeve he threw down his case of instruments and snuffersand as the dice took a run against him in his endeavouring to catch the snuffers  in fallinghe thrust Monsieur  Blondel  off the table and Count  de Pagan  o'top of him  'Twas to no purpose for a man lame as my uncle  Toby  was to think of redressing all these evils by himselfhe rung his bell for his man  Trim    Trim  quoth my uncle  Toby  pri'thee see what confusion I have here been makingI must have some better contrivance  Trim  Can'st not thou take my rule and measure the length and breadth of this table and then go and bespeak me one as big againYes an' please your Honour replied  Trim  making a bowbut I hope your Honour will be soon well enough to get down to your country seat whereas your Honour takes so much pleasure in fortification we could manage this matter to a T  I must here inform you that this servant of my uncle  Toby  's who went by the name of  Trim  had been a Corporal in my uncle's own companyhis real name was  James Butler  but having got the nickname of  Trim  in the regiment my uncle  Toby  unless when he happened to be very angry with him would never call him by any other name  The poor fellow had been disabled for the service by a wound on his left knee by a musketbullet at the battle of  Landen  which was two years before the affair of  Namur  and as the fellow was well beloved in the regiment and a handy fellow into the bargain my uncle  Toby  took him for his servant and of excellent use was he attending my uncle  Toby  in the camp and in his quarters as valet groom barber cook sempster  and nurse and indeed from first to last waited upon him and served him with great fidelity and affection  My uncle  Toby  loved the man in return and what attached him more to him still was the similitude of their knowledgeFor Corporal  Trim  for so for the future I shall call him by four years occasional attention to his Master's discourse upon fortified towns and the advantage of prying and peeping continually into his Master's plans  c  exclusive and besides what he gained HOBBYHORSICALLY as a bodyservant  Non HobbyHorsical per se  had become no mean proficient in the science and was thought by the cook and chambermaid to know as much of the nature of strongholds as my uncle  Toby  himself  I have but one more stroke to give to finish Corporal  Trim  's characterand it is the only dark line in itThe fellow lov'd to adviseor rather to hear himself talk his carriage however was so perfectly respectful 'twas easy to keep him silent when you had him so but set his tongue agoingyou had no hold of himhe was volublethe eternal interlardings of  your Honour  with the respectfulness of Corporal  Trim  's manner interceding so strong in behalf of his elocutionthat tho' you might have been incommodedyou could not well be angry My uncle  Toby  was seldom either the one or the other with himor at least this fault in  Trim  broke no squares with 'em My uncle  Toby  as I said loved the manand besides as he ever looked upon a faithful servantbut as a humble friendhe could not  bear to stop his mouthSuch was Corporal  Trim  If I durst presume continued  Trim  to give your Honour my advice and speak my opinion in this matterThou art welcome  Trim  quoth my uncle  Toby  speakspeak what thou thinkest upon the subject man without fear Why then replied  Trim  not hanging his ears and scratching his head like a country lout but stroking his hair back from his forehead and standing erect as before his divisionI think quoth  Trim  advancing his left which was his lame leg a little forwardsand pointing with his right hand open towards a map of  Dunkirk  which was pinn'd against the hangingsI think quoth Corporal  Trim  with humble submission to your Honour's better judgmentthat these  ravelins bastions curtins and hornworks make but a poor contemptible fiddle faddle piece of work of it here upon paper compared to what your Honour and I could make of it were we in the country by ourselves and had but a rood or a rood and a half of ground to do what we pleased with As summer is coming on continued  Trim  your Honour might sit out of doors and give me the nographycall it ichnography quoth my uncleof the town or citadel your Honour was pleased to sit down beforeand I will be shot by your Honour upon the glacis of it if I did not fortify it to your Honour's mindI dare say thou would'st  Trim  quoth my uncleFor if your Honour continued the Corporal could but mark me the polygon with its exact lines and anglesThat I could do very well quoth my  uncleI would begin with the fossé and if your Honour could tell me the proper depth and breadthI can to a hair's breadth  Trim  replied my uncleI would throw out the earth upon this hand towards the town for the scarpand on that hand towards the campaign for the counterscarpVery right  Trim  quoth my uncle  Toby  And when I had sloped them to your mindan' please your Honour I would face the glacis as the finest fortifications are done in  Flanders  with sodsand as your Honour knows they should beand I would make the walls and parapets with sods tooThe best engineers call them gazons  Trim  said my uncle  Toby  Whether they are gazons or sods is not much matter replied  Trim  your Honour knows they are ten times beyond a facing either of brick or stoneI know they are  Trim  in some respectsquoth my uncle  Toby  nodding his headfor a cannonball enters into the gazon right onwards without bringing any rubbish down with it which might fill the fossé as was the case at  St Nicolas  's  Gate  and facilitate the passage over it  Your Honour understands these matters replied Corporal  Trim  better than any officer in his Majesty's servicebut would your Honour please to let the bespeaking of the table alone and let us but go into the country I would work under your Honour's directions like a horse and make fortifications for you something like a tansy with all their batteries saps ditches and palisadoes that it should be worth all the world's riding twenty miles to go and see it  My uncle  Toby  blushed as red as scarlet as  Trim  went onbut it was not a blush of guiltof modestyor of angerit was a blush of joyhe was fired with Corporal  Trim  's project and description  Trim  said my uncle  Toby  thou hast said enoughWe might begin the campaign continued  Trim  on the very day that his Majesty and the Allies take the field and demolish them town by town as fast as  Trim  quoth my uncle  Toby  say no moreYour Honour continued  Trim  might sit in your armchair pointing to it this fine weather giving me your orders and I wouldSay no more  Trim  quoth my uncle  Toby  Besides your Honour would get not only pleasure and good pastimebut good air and good exercise and good healthand your Honour's wound would be well in a month  Thou hast said enough  Trim  quoth my uncle  Toby  putting his hand into his breechespocketI like thy project mightilyAnd if your Honour pleases I'll this moment go and buy a pioneer's spade to take down with us and I'll bespeak a shovel and a pickax and a couple ofSay no more  Trim  quoth my uncle  Toby  leaping up upon one leg quite overcome with raptureand thrusting a guinea into  Trim  's hand  Trim  said my uncle  Toby  say no morebut go down  Trim  this moment my lad and bring up my supper this instant  Trim  ran down and brought up his Master's supperto no purpose  Trim  's plan of operation ran so in my uncle  Toby  's head he could not taste it  Trim  quoth my uncle  Toby  get me  tobed'twas all oneCorporal  Trim  's description had fired his imaginationmy uncle  Toby  could not shut his eyesThe more he consider'd it the more bewitching the scene appeared to himso that two full hours before daylight he had come to a final determination and had concerted the whole plan of his and Corporal  Trim  's decampment  My uncle  Toby  had a little neat countryhouse of his own in the village where my father's estate lay at  Shandy  which had been left him by an old uncle with a small estate of about one hundred pounds a year Behind this house and contiguous to it was a kitchengarden of about half an acreand at the bottom of the garden and cut off from it by a tall yew hedge was a bowlinggreen containing just about as much  ground as Corporal  Trim  wished forso that as  Trim  uttered the words "A rood and a half of ground to do what they would with"this identical bowlinggreen instantly presented itself and became curiously painted all at once upon the retina of my uncle  Toby  's fancywhich was the physical cause of making him change colour or at least of heightening his blush to that immoderate degree I spoke of  Never did lover post down to a belov'd mistress with more heat and expectation than my uncle  Toby  did to enjoy this selfsame thing in privateI say in privatefor it was sheltered from the house as I told you by a tall yew hedge and was covered on the other three sides from mortal sight by rough holly and thickset flowering shrubsso that the  idea of not being seen did not a little contribute to the idea of pleasure preconceived in my uncle  Toby  's mindVain thought however thick it was planted aboutor private soever it might seemto think dear uncle  Toby  of enjoying a thing which took up a whole rood and a half of groundand not have it known  How my uncle  Toby  and Corporal  Trim  managed this matterwith the history of their campaigns which were no way barren of eventsmay make no uninteresting underplot in the epitasis and working up of this dramaAt present the scene must dropand change for the parlour fireside  CHAP VI  What can they be doing brother said my fatherI think replied my uncle  Toby  taking as I told you his pipe from his mouth and striking the ashes out of it as he began his sentenceI think replied heit would not be amiss brother if we rung the bell  Pray what's all that racket over our heads  Obadiah  quoth my fathermy brother and I can scarce hear ourselves speak  Sir answer'd  Obadiah  making a bow towards his leftshouldermy Mistress is taken very badlyand where's  Susannah  running down the garden there  as if they were going to ravish herSir she is running the shortest cut into the town replied  Obadiah  to fetch the old midwifeThen saddle a horse quoth my father and do you go directly for Dr  Slop  the manmidwife with all our servicesand let him know your Mistress is fallen into labourand that I desire he will return with you with all speed  It is very strange says my father addressing himself to my uncle  Toby  as  Obadiah  shut the dooras there is so expert an operator as Dr  Slop  so nearthat my wife should persist to the very last in this obstinate humour of hers in trusting the life of my child who has had one misfortune already to the ignorance of an old womanand not only the life of my child brotherbut her own  life and with it the lives of all the children I might peradventure have begot out of her hereafter  Mayhap brother replied my uncle  Toby  my sister does it to save the expenceA pudding's endreplied my fatherthe doctor must be paid the same for inaction as actionif not betterto keep him in temper  Then it can be out of nothing in the whole world quoth my uncle  Toby  in the simplicity of his heartbut MODESTYMy sister I dare say added he does not care to let a man come so near her * * * * I will not say whether my uncle  Toby  had completed the sentence or not'tis for his advantage to suppose he hadas I think he could have added no  ONE WORD which would have improved it  If on the contrary my uncle  Toby  had not fully arrived at his period's endthen the world stands indebted to the sudden snapping of my father's tobaccopipe for one of the neatest examples of that ornamental figure in oratory which Rhetoricians stile the  Aposiopesis  Just heaven how does the  Poco piu  and the  Poco meno  of the  Italian  artiststhe insensible MORE or LESS determine the precise line of beauty in the sentence as well as in the statue How do the slight touches of the chifel the pencil the pen the fiddlestick  et caetera  give the true swell which give the true pleasureO my countrymenbe nicebe cautious of your languageand never O never let it be forgotten upon what  small particles your eloquence and your fame depend  "My sister mayhap" quoth my uncle  Toby  "does not choose to let a man come so near her * * * *" Make this dash'tis an AposiopesisTake the dash away and write  Backside  'tis BawdyScratch Backside out and put  Cover'dway  in'tis a Metaphorand I dare say as fortification ran so much in my uncle  Toby  's head that if he had been left to have added one word to the sentencethat word was it  But whether that was the case or not the caseor whether the snapping of my father's tobaccopipe so critically happened thro' accident or angerwill be seen in due time  CHAP VII  THO' my father was a good natural philosopheryet he was something of a moral philosopher too for which reason when his tobaccopipe snapp'd short in the middlehe had nothing to doas suchbut to have taken hold of the two pieces and thrown them gently upon the back of the fireHe did no such thinghe threw them with all the violence in the worldand to give the action still more emphasishe started up upon both his legs to do it  This look'd something like heatand the manner of his reply to what my uncle  Toby  was saying prov'd it was so  "Not choose" quoth my father repeating my uncle  Toby  's words "to let a man come so near her"By heaven brother  Toby  you would try the patience of a  Job  and I think I have the plagues of one already without itWhyWhereWhereinWhereforeUpon what account replied my uncle  Toby  in the utmost astonishmentTo think said my father of a man living to your age brother and knowing so little about womenI know nothing at all about themreplied my uncle  Toby  and I think continued he that the shock I received the year after the demolition of  Dunkirk  in my affair with widow  Wadman  which shock you know I should not have received but from my total ignorance of the sexhas given me just cause to say That I neither know nor do pretend to  know any thing about 'em or their concerns eitherMethinks brother replied my father you might at least know so much as the right end of a woman from the wrong  It is said in  Aristotle  's  MasterPiece  "That when a man doth think of any thing which is pasthe looketh down upon the groundbut that when he thinketh of something which is to come he looketh up towards the heavens"  My uncle  Toby  I suppose thought of neitherfor he look'd horizontallyRight endquoth my uncle  Toby  muttering the two words low to himself and fixing his two eyes insensibly as he muttered them upon a small crevice form'd by a bad joint in the chimneypieceRight end of a womanI declare  quoth my uncle I know no more which it is than the man in the moonand if I was to think continued my uncle  Toby  keeping his eye still fix'd upon the bad joint this month together I am sure I should not be able to find it out  Then brother  Toby  replied my father I will tell you  Every thing in this world continued my father filling a fresh pipeevery thing in this earthly world my dear brother  Toby  has two handlesNot always quoth my uncle  Toby  At least replied my father every one has two handswhich comes to the same thingNow if a man was to sit down cooly and consider within himself the make the shape the construction comatability and convenience of all the parts which constitute  the whole of that animal call'd Woman and compare them analogicallyI never understood rightly the meaning of that wordquoth my uncle  Toby  ANALOGY replied my father is the certain relation and agreement which differentHere a devil of a rap at the door snapp'd my father's definition like his tobacco pipe in twoand at the same time crushed the head of as notable and curious a dissertation as ever was engendered in the womb of speculationit was some months before my father could get an opportunity to be safely deliver'd of itAnd at this hour it is a thing full as problematical as the subject of the dissertation itselfconsidering the confusion and distresses of our domestic misadventures which are now coming thick one upon the back of another whether  I shall be able to find a place for it in the third volume or not  CHAP VIII  IT is about an hour and a half's tolerable good reading since my uncle  Toby  rung the bell when  Obadiah  was order'd to saddle a horse and go for Dr  Slop  the manmidwifeso that no one can say with reason that I have not allowed  Obadiah  time enough poetically speaking and considering the emergency too both to go and cometho' morally and truly speaking the man perhaps has scarce had time to get on his boots  If the hypercritic will go upon this and is resolved after all to take a pendulum  and measure the true distance betwixt the ringing of the bell and the rap at the doorand after finding it to be no more than two minutes thirteen seconds and three fifthsshould take upon him to insult over me for such a breach in the unity or rather probability of timeI would remind him that the idea of duration and of its simple modes is got merely from the train and succession of our ideasand is the true scholastic pendulumand by which as a scholar I will be tried in this matterabjuring and detesting the jurisdiction of all other pendulums whatever  I would therefore desire him to consider that it is but poor eight miles from  ShandyHall  to Dr  Slop  the man midwife's houseand that whilst  Obadiah  has been going those said miles and back  I have brought my uncle  Toby  from  Namur  quite across all  Flanders  into  England  That I have had him ill upon my hands near four yearsand have since travelled him and Corporal  Trim  in a chariot and four a journey of near two hundred miles down into  Yorkshire  all which put together must have prepared the reader's imagination for the entrance of Dr  Slop  upon the stageas much at least I hope as a dance a song or a concerto between the acts  If my hypercritic is intractablealledging that two minutes and thirteen seconds are no more than two minutes and thirteen secondswhen I have said all I can about themand that this plea tho' it might save me dramatically will damn me biographically rendering my book from this very moment a profess'd  ROMANCE which before was a book apocryphalIf I am thus pressedI then put an end to the whole objection and controversy about it all at onceby acquainting him that  Obadiah  had not got above threescore yards from the stableyard before he met with Dr  Slop  and indeed he gave a dirty proof that he had met with himand was within an ace of giving a tragical one too  Imagine to yourselfbut this had better begin a new chapter  CHAP IX  IMagine to yourself a little squat uncourtly figure of a Doctor  Slop  of about four feet and a half perpendicular  height with a breadth of back and a sesquipedality of belly which might have done honour to a serjeant in the horseguards  Such were the outlines of Dr  Slop  's figure whichif you have read  Hogarth  's analysis of beauty and if you have not I wish you wouldyou must know may as certainly be caracatur'd and convey'd to the mind by three strokes as three hundred  Imagine such a onefor such I say were the outlines of Dr  Slop  's figure coming slowly along foot by foot waddling thro' the dirt upon the vertebrae of a little diminutive ponyof a pretty colourbut of strengthalackscarce able to have made an amble of it under such a fardel had the roads been  in an ambling conditionThey were notImagine to yourself  Obadiah  mounted upon a strong monster of a coachhorse prick'd into a full gallop and making all practicable speed the adverse way  Pray Sir let me interest you a moment in this description  Had Dr  Slop  beheld  Obadiah  a mile off posting in a narrow lane directly towards him at that monstrous ratesplashing and plunging like a devil thro' thick and thin as he approach'd would not such a phaenomenon with such a vortex of mud and water moving along with it round its axishave been a subject of juster apprehension to Dr  Slop  in his situation than the  worst  of  Whiston  's cometsTo say nothing of the NUCLEUS  that is of  Obadiah  and the coachhorseIn my idea the vortex alone of 'em was enough to have involved and carried if not the doctor at least the doctor's pony quite away with it What then do you think must the terror and hydrophobia of Dr  Slop  have been when you read which you are just going to do that he was advancing thus warily along towards  ShandyHall  and had approach'd to within sixty yards of it and within five yards of a sudden turn made by an acute angle of the garden walland in the dirtiest part of a dirty lanewhen  Obadiah  and his coachhorse turn'd the corner rapid furiouspopfull upon himNothing I think in nature can be supposed more terrible than such a Rencounterso imprompt so ill prepared to stand the shock of it as Dr  Slop  was  What could Dr  Slop  doHe cross'd himself ✚ Pughbut the doctor Sir was a PapistNo matter he had better have kept hold of the pummel He had sonay as it happened he had better have done nothing at allfor in crossing himself he let go his whipand in attempting to save his whip betwixt his knee and his saddle's skirt as it slipp'd he lost his stirrupin losing which he lost his seatand in the multitude of all these losses which by the bye shews what little advantage there is in crossing the unfortunate doctor lost his presence of mind So that without waiting for  Obadiah  's onset he left his pony to its destiny tumbling off it diagonally something in the stile and manner of a pack of wool and without any other consequence from the fall save that of being left as it would have been  with the broadest part of him sunk about twelve inches deep in the mire  Obadiah  pull'd off his cap twice to Dr  Slop  once as he was fallingand then again when he saw him seatedIlltimed complaisancehad not the fellow better have stopp'd his horse and got off and help'd himSir he did all that his situation would allowbut the MOMENTUM of the coachhorse was so great that  Obadiah  could not do it all at oncehe rode in a circle three times round Dr  Slop  before he could fully accomplish it any howand at the last when he did stop his beast 'twas done with such an explosion of mud that  Obadiah  had better have been a league off In short never was a Dr  Slop  so beluted and so transubstantiated since that affair came into fashion  CHAP X  WHEN Dr  Slop  entered the backparlour where my father and my uncle  Toby  were discoursing upon the nature of womenit was hard to determine whether Dr  Slop  's figure or Dr  Slop  's presence occasioned more surprize to them for as the accident happened so near the house as not to make it worth while for  Obadiah  to remou  him  Obadiah  had led him in as he was  unwiped    unappointed    unanealed  with all his stains and blotches on himHe stood like  Hamlet  's ghost motionless and speechless for a full minute and a half at the parlour door  Obadiah  still holding his hand with all the majesty of mud His hinder parts upon which he had received his fall totally besmear'dand  in every other part of him blotched over in such a manner with  Obadiah  's explosion that you would have sworn without mental reservation that every grain of it had taken effect  Here was a fair opportunity for my uncle  Toby  to have triumph'd over my father in his turnfor no mortal who had beheld Dr  Slop  in that pickle could have dissented from so much at least of my uncle  Toby  's opinion "That mayhap his sister might not care to let such a Dr  Slop  come so near her * * * *" But it was the  Argumentum ad hominem  and if my uncle  Toby  was not very expert at it you may think he might not care to use itNo the reason was'twas not his nature to insult  Dr  Slop  's presence at that time was no less problematical than the mode of it tho' it is certain one moment's reflection in my father might have solved it for he had apprized Dr  Slop  but the week before that my mother was at her full reckoning and as the doctor had heard nothing since 'twas natural and very political too in him to have taken a ride to  ShandyHall  as he did merely to see how matters went on  But my father's mind took unfortunately a wrong turn in the investigation running like the hypercritic's altogether upon the ringing of the bell and the rap upon the doormeasuring their distanceand keeping his mind so intent upon the operation as to have power to think of nothing elsecommonplace infirmity of the greatest mathematicians  working with might and main at the demonstration and so wasting all their strength upon it that they have none left in them to draw the corollary to do good with  The ringing of the bell and the rap upon the door struck likewise strong upon the sensorium of my uncle  Toby  but it excited a very different train of thoughtsthe two irreconcileable pulsations instantly brought  Stevinus  the great engineer along with them into my uncle  Toby  's mindWhat business  Stevinus  had in this affairis the greatest problem of allit shall be solvedbut not in the next chapter  CHAP XI  WRiting when properly managed as you may be sure I think mine is is but a different name for conversation As no one who knows what he is about in good company would venture to talk allso no author who understands the just boundaries of decorum and good breeding would presume to think all The truest respect which you can pay to the reader's understanding is to halve this matter amicably and leave him something to imagine in his turn as well as yourself  For my own part I am eternally paying him compliments of this kind and do all that lies in my power to keep his imagination as busy as my own  'Tis his turn nowI have given an ample description of Dr  Slop  's sad overthrow and of his sad appearance in the back parlourhis imagination must now go on with it for a while  Let the reader imagine then that Dr  Slop  has told his taleand in what words and with what aggravations his fancy choosesLet him suppose that  Obadiah  has told his tale also and with such rueful looks of affected concern as he thinks will best contrast the two figures as they stand by each otherLet him imagine that my father has stepp'd up stairs to see my motherAnd to conclude this work of imaginationlet him imagine the doctor wash'drubb'd downcondoled withfelicitatedgot into a pair of  Obadiah  's pumps stepping forwards towards the  door upon the very point of entring upon action  Trucetruce good Dr  Slop  stay thy obstetric handreturn it safe into thy bosom to keep it warmlittle dost thou know what obstacleslittle dost thou think what hidden causes retard its operationHast thou Dr  Slop  hast thou been intrusted with the secret articles of this solemn treaty which has brought thee into this placeArt thou aware that at this instant a daughter of  Lucina  is put obstetrically over thy head Alas 'tis too trueBesides great son of  Pilumnus  what canst thou doThou hast come forth unarm'dthou hast left thy  tire tête  thy newinvented  forceps  thy  crotchet  thy  squirt  and all thy instruments of salvation and deliverance behind theeBy heaven  at this moment they are hanging up in a green bays bag betwixt thy two pistols at thy bed's headRingcallsend  Obadiah  back upon the coachhorse to bring them with all speed  Make great haste  Obadiah  quoth my father and I'll give thee a crownand quoth my uncle  Toby  I'll give him another  CHAP XII  YOUR sudden and unexpected arrival quoth my uncle  Toby  addressing himself to Dr  Slop  all three of them sitting down to the fire together as my uncle  Toby  began to speakinstantly brought the great  Stevinus  into my head who you must know is a favourite  author with meThen added my father making use of the argument  Ad Crumenam  I will lay twenty guineas to a single crown piece which will serve to give away to  Obadiah  when he gets back that this same  Stevinus  was some engineer or otheror has wrote something or other either directly or indirectly upon the science of fortification  He has soreplied my uncle  Toby  I knew it said my fathertho' for the soul of me I cannot see what kind of connection there can be betwixt Dr  Slop  's sudden coming and a discourse upon fortificationyet I fear'd itTalk of what we will brotheror let the occasion be never so foreign or unfit for the subjectyou are sure to bring it in I would not brother  Toby  continued  my fatherI declare I would not have my head so full of curtins and hornworksThat I dare say you would not quoth Dr  Slop  interrupting him and laughing most immoderately at his pun  Dennis  the critic could not detest and abhor a pun or the insinuation of a pun more cordially than my fatherhe would grow testy upon it at any timebut to be broke in upon by one in a serious discourse was as bad he would say as a fillip upon the nosehe saw no difference  Sir quoth my uncle  Toby  addressing himself to Dr  Slop  the curtins my brother  Shandy  mentions here have nothing to do with bedsteadstho' I know  Du Cange  says "That bedcurtains  in all probability have taken their name from them"nor have the hornworks he speaks of any thing in the world to do with the hornworks of cuckoldomBut the  curtin  Sir is the word we use in fortification for that part of the wall or rampart which lies between the two bastions and joins themBesiegers seldom offer to carry on their attacks directly against the curtin for this reason because they are so well  flanked  'Tis the case of other curtins quoth Dr  Slop  laughing However continued my uncle  Toby  to make them sure we generally choose to place ravelins before them taking care only to extend them beyond the fossé or ditchThe common men who know very little of fortification confound the ravelin and the halfmoon togethertho' they are very different thingsnot in their figure or  construction for we make them exactly aliks in all pointsfor they always consist of two faces making a salient angle with the gorges not straight but in form of a crescentWhere then lies the difference quoth my father a little testilyIn their situations answered my uncle  Toby  For when a ravelin brother stands before the curtin it is a ravelin and when a ravelin stands before a bastion then the ravelin is not a ravelinit is a halfmoona halfmoon likewise is a halfmoon and no more so long as it stands before its bastionbut was it to change place and get before the curtin'twould be no longer a halfmoon a halfmoon in that case is not a halfmoon'tis no more than a ravelinI think quoth my father that the noble science of defence has its weak sidesas well as others  As for the hornworks high ho sigh'd my father which continued my uncle  Toby  my brother was speaking of they are a very considerable part of an outworkthey are called by the  French  engineers  Ouvrage à corne  and we generally make them to cover such places as we suspect to be weaker than the rest'tis form'd by two epaulments or demibastionsthey are very pretty and if you will take a walk I'll engage to shew you one well worth your troubleI own continued my uncle  Toby  when we crown themthey are much stronger but then they are very expensive and take up a great deal of ground so that in my opinion they are most of use to cover or defend the head of a camp otherwise the double tenailleBy the mother who bore usbrother  Toby  quoth my father not able to hold out any longeryou would provoke a sainthere have you got us I know not how not only souse into the middle of the old subject againBut so full is your head of these confounded works that tho' my wife is this moment in the pains of labourand you hear her cry outyet nothing will serve you but to carry off the manmidwife  Accoucheur  if you please quoth Dr  Slop  With all my heart replied my father I don't care what they call youbut I wish the whole science of fortification with all its inventors at the devilit has been the death of thousandsand it will be mine in the endI would not I would not brother  Toby  have my brains so full of saps mines blinds gabions palisadoes ravelins halfmoons and such trumpery  to be proprietor of  Namur  and of all the towns in  Flanders  with it  My uncle  Toby  was a man patient of injuriesnot from want of courageI have told you in the fifth chapter of this second book "That he was a man of courage"And will add here that where just occasions presented or called it forthI know no man under whose arm I would sooner have taken shelter nor did this arise from any insensibility or obtuseness of his intellectual partsfor he felt this insult of my father's as feelingly as a man could dobut he was of a peaceful placid natureno jarring element in itall was mix'd up so kindly within him my uncle  Toby  had scarce a heart to retaliate upon a fly  Gosays he one day at dinner to an overgrown one which had buzz'd about his nose and tormented him cruelly all dinnertimeand which after infinite attempts he had caught at last as it flew by himI'll not hurt thee says my uncle  Toby  rising from his chair and going across the room with the fly in his handI'll not hurt a hair of thy headGo says he lifting up the sash and opening his hand as he spoke to let it escapego poor devil get thee gone why should I hurt theeThis world surely is wide enough to hold both thee and me  I was but ten years old when this happenedbut whether it was that the action itself was more in unison to my nerves at that age of pity which instantly set my whole frame into one vibration  of most pleasurable sensationor how far the manner and expression of it might go towards itor in what degree or by what secret magica tone of voice and harmony of movement attuned by mercy might find a passage to my heart I know notthis I know that the lesson of universal goodwill then taught and imprinted by my uncle  Toby  has never since been worn out of my mind And tho' I would not depreciate what the study of the  Literae humaniores  at the university have done for me in that respect or discredit the other helps of an expensive education bestowed upon me both at home and abroad sinceyet I often think that I owe one half of my philanthropy to that one accidental impression  ☞ This is to serve for parents and governors instead of a whole volume upon the subject  I could not give the reader this stroke in my uncle  Toby  's picture by the instrument with which I drew the other parts of itthat taking in no more than the mere HOBBYHORSICAL likenessthis is a part of his moral character My father in this patient endurance of wrongs which I mention was very different as the reader must long ago have noted he had a much more acute and quick sensibility of nature attended with a little soreness of temper tho' this never transported him to any thing which looked like malignancyyet in the little rubs and vexations of life 'twas apt to shew itself in a drollish and witty kind of peevishnessHe was however frank and generous in his natureat all times open to conviction and in the little ebullitions of this subacid humour towards others but particularly  towards my uncle  Toby  whom he truly lovedhe would feel more pain ten times told except in the affair of my aunt  Dinah  or where an hypothesis was concerned than what he ever gave  The characters of the two brothers in this view of them reflected light upon each other and appear'd with great advantage in this affair which arose about  Stevinus  I need not tell the reader if he keeps a HOBBYHORSEthat a man's HOBBYHORSE is as tender a part as he has about him and that these unprovoked strokes at my uncle  Toby  's could not be unfelt by himNoas I said above my uncle  Toby  did feel them and very sensibly too  Pray Sir what said heHow did he behaveOh Sirit was great For as soon as my father had done insulting his HOBBYHORSEhe turned his head without the least emotion from Dr  Slop  to whom he was addressing his discourse and look'd up into my father's face with a countenance spread over with so much good natureso placidso fraternalso inexpressibly tender towards himit penetrated my father to his heart He rose up hastily from his chair and seizing hold of both my uncle  Toby  's hands as he spokeBrother  Toby  said heI beg thy pardonforgive I pray thee this rash humour which my mother gave meMy dear dear brother answer'd my uncle  Toby  rising up by my father's help say no more about ityou are heartily welcome had it been ten times as much  brother But 'tis ungenerous replied my father to hurt any mana brother worsebut to hurt a brother of such gentle mannersso unprovokingand so unresenting'tis baseBy heaven 'tis cowardlyYou are heartily welcome brother quoth my uncle  Toby  had it been fifty times as muchBesides what have I to do my dear  Toby  cried my father either with your amusements or your pleasures unless it was in my power which it is not to increase their measure  Brother  Shandy  answer'd my uncle  Toby  looking wistfully in his faceyou are much mistaken in this pointfor you do increase my pleasure very much in begetting children for the  Shandy  family at your time of lifeBut by that Sir quoth Dr  Slop  Mr  Shandy  increases  his ownNot a jot quoth my father  CHAP XIII  MY brother does it quoth my uncle  Toby  out of  principle  In a familyway I suppose quoth Dr  Slop  Pshawsaid my father'tis not worth talking of  CHAP XIV  AT the end of the last chapter my father and my uncle  Toby  were left both standing like  Brutus  and  Cassius  at the close of the scene making up their accounts  As my father spoke the three last wordshe sat downmy uncle  Toby  exactly followed his example only that before he took his chair he rung the bell to order Corporal  Trim  who was in waiting to step home for  Stevinus  my uncle  Toby  's house being no further off than the opposite side of the way  Some men would have dropp'd the subject of  Stevinus  but my uncle  Toby  had no resentment in his heart and he went on with the subject to shew my father that he had none  Your sudden appearance Dr  Slop  quoth my uncle resuming the discourse instantly brought  Stevinus  into my head My father you may be sure did not offer to lay any more wagers upon  Stevinus  's headBecause continued my  uncle  Toby  the celebrated sailing chariot which belonged to Prince  Maurice  and was of such wonderful contrivance and velocity as to carry half a dozen people thirty  German  miles in I don't know how few minuteswas invented by  Stevinus  that great mathematician and engineer  You might have spared your servant the trouble quoth Dr  Slop  as the fellow is lame of going for  Stevinus  's account of it because in my return from  Leyden  thro' the  Hague  I walked as far as  Schevling  which is two long miles on purpose to take a view of it  That's nothing replied my uncle  Toby  to what the learned  Peireskius  did who walked a matter of five hundred miles reckoning from  Paris  to  Schevling    and from  Schevling  to  Paris  back again in order to see itand nothing else  Some men cannot bear to be outgone  The more fool  Peireskius  replied Dr  Slop  But mark 'twas out of no contempt of  Peireskius  at allbut that  Peireskius  's indefatigable labour in trudging so far on foot out of love for the sciences reduced the exploit of Dr  Slop  in that affair to nothingthe more fool  Peireskius  said he againWhy soreplied my father taking his brother's part not only to make reparation as fast as he could for the insult he had given him which sat still upon my father's mindbut partly that my father began really to interest himself in the discourseWhy sosaid he Why is  Peireskius  or any man else to be abused for an appetite  for that or any other morsel of sound knowledge For notwithstanding I know nothing of the chariot in question continued he the inventor of it must have had a very mechanical head and tho' I cannot guess upon what principles of philosophy he has atchiev'd ityet certainly his machine has been constructed upon solid ones be they what they will or it could not have answer'd at the rate my brother mentions  It answered replied my uncle  Toby  as well if not better for as  Peireskius  elegantly expresses it speaking of the velocity of its motion  Tam citus erat    quam erat ventus  which unless I have forgot my Latin is  that it was as swift as the wind itself  But pray Dr  Slop  quoth my father interrupting my uncle tho' not without begging pardon for it at the same time upon what principles was this selfsame chariot set agoingUpon very pretty principles to be sure replied Dr  Slop  and I have often wondered continued he evading the question why none of our gentry who live upon large plains like this of oursespecially they whose wives are not past childbearing attempt nothing of this kind for it would not only be infinitely expeditious upon sudden calls to which the sex is subjectif the wind only servedbut would be excellent good husbandry to make use of the winds which cost nothing and which eat nothing rather than horses which the devil take 'em both cost and eat a great deal  For that very reason replied my father "Because they cost nothing and because they eat nothing"the scheme is badit is the consumption of our products as well as the manufactures of them which gives bread to the hungry circulates tradebrings in money and supports the value of our landsand tho' I own if I was a prince I would generously recompense the scientific head which brought forth such contrivancesyet I would as peremptorily suppress the use of them  My father here had got into his elementand was going on as prosperously with his dissertation upon trade as my uncle  Toby  had before upon his of fortificationbut to the loss of much sound knowledge the destinies in the morning had decreed that no  dissertation of any kind should be spun by my father that dayfor as he opened his mouth to begin the next sentence  CHAP XV  IN popp'd Corporal  Trim  with  Stevinus  But 'twas too lateall the discourse had been exhausted without him and was running into a new channel  You may take the book home again  Trim  said my uncle  Toby  nodding to him  But pri'thee Corporal quoth my father drollinglook first into it and see if thou canst spy aught of a sailing chariot in it  Corporal  Trim  by being in the service had learned to obeyand not to remonstrateso taking the book to a sidetable and running over the leaves an' please your Honour said  Trim  I can see no such thinghowever continued the Corporal drolling a little in his turn I'll make sure work of it an' please your Honourso taking hold of the two covers of the book one in each hand and letting the leaves fall down as he bent the covers back he gave the book a good sound shake  There is something fallen out however said  Trim  an' please your Honour but it is not a chariot or any thing like onePri'thee Corporal said my father smiling what is it thenI think answered  Trim  stooping to take it up'tis more like a sermonfor it begins  with a text of scripture and the chapter and verseand then goes on not as a chariotbut like a sermon directly  The company smiled  I cannot conceive how it is possible quoth my uncle  Toby  for such a thing as a sermon to have got into my  Stevinus  I think 'tis a sermon replied  Trim  but if it please your Honours as it is a fair hand I will read you a pagefor  Trim  you must know loved to hear himself read almost as well as talk  I have ever a strong propensity said my father to look into things which cross my way by such strange fatalities as theseand as we have nothing better to do at least till  Obadiah  gets back  I should be obliged to you brother if Dr  Slop  has no objection to it to order the Corporal to give us a page or two of itif he is as able to do it as he seems willing An' please your Honour quoth  Trim  I officiated two whole campaigns in  Flanders  as clerk to the chaplain of the regimentHe can read it quoth my uncle  Toby  as well as I can  Trim  I assure you was the best scholar in my company and should have had the next halberd but for the poor fellow's misfortune Corporal  Trim  laid his hand upon his heart and made an humble bow to his masterthen laying down his hat upon the floor and taking up the sermon in his lefthand in order to have his right at libertyhe advanced nothing doubting into the middle of the room where he could best see and be best seen by his audience  CHAP XVI  If you have any objectionsaid my father addressing himself to Dr  Slop  Not in the least replied Dr  Slop  for it does not appear on which side of the question it is wroteit may be a composition of a divine of our church as well as yoursso that we run equal risks'Tis wrote upon neither side quoth  Trim  for 'tis only upon  Conscience  an' please your Honours  Trim  's reason put his audience into good humourall but Dr  Slop  who turning his head about towards  Trim  look'd a little angry  Begin  Trim  and read distinctly quoth my fatherI will an' please your  Honour replied the Corporal making a bow and bespeaking attention with a slight movement of his righthand  CHAP XVII  But before the Corporal begins I must first give you a description of his attitudeotherwise he will naturally stand represented by your imagination in an uneasy posturestiffperpendiculardividing the weight of his body equally upon both legshis eye fix'd as if on dutyhis look determinedclinching the sermon in his lefthand like his firelockIn a word you would be apt to paint  Trim  as if he was standing in his platoon ready for actionHis attitude was as unlike all this as you can conceive  He stood before them with his body swayed and bent forwards just so far as to make an angle of degrees and a half upon the plain of the horizonwhich sound orators to whom I address this know very well to be the true persuasive angle of incidencein any other angle you may talk and preach'tis certainand it is done every daybut with what effectI leave the world to judge  The necessity of this precise angle of degrees and a half to a mathematical exactnessdoes it not shew us by the wayhow the arts and sciences mutually befriend each other  How the duce Corporal  Trim  who knew not so much as an acute angle from an obtuse one came to hit it so exactly  or whether it was chance or nature or good sense or imitation  c  shall be commented upon in that part of this cyclopaedia of arts and sciences where the instrumental parts of the eloquence of the senate the pulpit the bar the coffeehouse the bedchamber and fireside fall under consideration  He stoodfor I repeat it to take the picture of him in at one view with his body sway'd and somewhat bent forwardshis rightleg firm under him sustaining seveneighths of his whole weightthe foot of his leftleg the defect of which was no disadvantage to his attitude advanced a littlenot laterally nor forwards but in a line betwixt themhis knee bent but that not violentlybut so as to fall within the limits of the line of beautyand I add  of the line of science toofor consider it had one eighth part of his body to bear upso that in this case the position of the leg is determinedbecause the foot could be no further advanced or the knee more bent than what would allow him mechanically to receive an eighth part of his whole weight under itand to carry it too  ☞ This I recommend to paintersneed I addto oratorsI think not for unless they practise itthey must fall upon their noses  So much for Corporal  Trim  's body and legsHe held the sermon looselynot carelessly in his lefthand raised something above his stomach and detach'd a little from his breasthis rightarm falling negligently by his side as nature  and the laws of gravity ordered itbut with the palm of it open and turned towards his audience ready to aid the sentiment in case it stood in need  Corporal  Trim  's eyes and the muscles of his face were in full harmony with the other parts of himhe look'd frankunconstrainedsomething assuredbut not bordering upon assurance  Let not the critic ask how Corporal  Trim  could come by all this I've told him it shall be explainedbut so he stood before my father my uncle  Toby  and Dr  Slop  so swayed his body so contrasted his limbs and with such an oratorical sweep throughout the whole figurea statuary might have modell'd from itnay I doubt whether the oldest Fellow of a Collegeor the  Hebrew  Professor himself could have much mended it  Trim  made a bow and read as follows  The SERMON  HEBREWS xiii  For we  trust  we have a good Conscience  "TRustTrust we have a good conscience"  Certainly  Trim  quoth my father interrupting him you give that sentence a very improper accent for you curl up your nose man and read it with such a sneering tone as if the Parson was going to abuse the Apostle  He is an' please your Honour replied  Trim  Pugh said my father smiling  Sir quoth Dr  Slop    Trim  is certainly in the right for the writer who I perceive is a Protestant by the snappish manner in which he takes up the Apostle is certainly going to abuse himif this treatment of him has not done it already But from whence replied my father have you concluded so soon Dr  Slop  that the writer is of our Churchfor aught I can see yethe may be of any ChurchBecause answered Dr  Slop  if he was of ourshe durst no more take such a licencethan a bear by his beardIf in our communion Sir a man was to insult an Apostlea saintor even the paring of a saint's nailhe would have his eyes scratched outWhat by the saint quoth my  uncle  Toby  No replied Dr  Slop  he would have an old house over his head Pray is the Inquisition an antient building answered my uncle  Toby  or is it a modern oneI know nothing of architecture replied Dr  Slop  An' please your Honours quoth  Trim  the Inquisition is the vilestPri'thee spare thy description  Trim  I hate the very name of it said my fatherNo matter for that answered Dr  Slop  it has its uses for tho' I'm no great advocate for it yet in such a case as this he would soon be taught better manners and I can tell him if he went on at that rate would be flung into the Inquisition for his pains God help him then quoth my uncle  Toby  Amen added  Trim  for heaven above knows I have a poor brother who has been fourteen years a captive in itI never heard one word of it before said  my uncle  Toby  hastilyHow came he there  Trim  O Sir the story will make your heart bleedas it has made mine a thousand timesbut it is too long to be told nowyour Honour shall hear it from first to last some day when I am working beside you in our fortificationsbut the short of the story is thisThat my brother  Tom  went over a servant to  Lisbon  and then married a  Jew  's widow who kept a small shop and sold sausages which some how or other was the cause of his being taken in the middle of the night out of his bed where he was lying with his wife and two small children and carried directly to the Inquisition where God help him continued  Trim  fetching a sigh from the bottom of his heartthe poor honest lad lies confined at this hourhe was as honest a soul added  Trim    pulling out his handkerchief as ever blood warm'd  The tears trickled down  Trim  's cheeks faster than he could well wipe them awayA dead silence in the room ensued for some minutesCertain proof of pity  Come  Trim  quoth my father after he saw the poor fellow's grief had got a little ventread onand put this melancholy story out of thy headI grieve that I interrupted theebut pri'thee begin the sermon againfor if the first sentence in it is matter of abuse as thou sayest I have a great desire to know what kind of provocation the Apostle has given  Corporal  Trim  wiped his face and returning his handkerchief into his pocket  and making a bow as he did ithe began again  The SERMON  HEBREWS xiii  For we  trust  we have a good Conscience  "TRust trust we have a good conscience Surely if there is any thing in this life which a man may depend upon and to the knowledge of which he is capable of arriving upon the most indisputable evidence it must be this very thingwhether he has a good conscience or no"  I am positive I am right quoth Dr  Slop    "If a man thinks at all he cannot well be a stranger to the true state of this accounthe must be privy to his own thoughts and desireshe must remember his past pursuits and know certainly the true springs and motives which in general have governed the actions of his life"  I defy him without an assistant quoth Dr  Slop    "In other matters we may be deceived by false appearances and as the wise man complains  hardly do we guess aright at the things that are upon the earth    and with labour do we find the things that are before us  But here the mind has all the evidence and facts within herselfis conscious of the web she has woveknows its texture and  fineness and the exact share which every passion has had in working upon the several designs which virtue or vice has plann'd before her"  The language is good and I declare  Trim  reads very well quoth my father  "Nowas conscience is nothing else but the knowledge which the mind has within herself of this and the judgment either of approbation or censure which it unavoidably makes upon the successive actions of our lives 'tis plain you will say from the very terms of the propositionwhenever this inward testimony goes against a man and he stands selfaccusedthat he must necessarily be a guilty manAnd on the contrary when the report is favourable on his side and his heart condemns  him notthat it is not a mater of  trust  as the Apostle intimatesbut a matter of  certainty  and fact that the conscience is good and that the man must be good also"  Then the Apostle is altogether in the wrong I suppose quoth Dr  Slop  and the Protestant divine is in the right Sir have patience replied my father for I think it will presently appear that  St Paul  and the Protestant divine are both of an opinionAs nearly so quoth Dr  Slop  as east is to westbut this continued he lifting both hands comes from the liberty of the press  It is no more at the worst replied my uncle  Toby  than the liberty of the pulpit for it does not appear that the sermon is printed or ever likely to be  Go on  Trim  quoth my father  "At first sight this may seem to be a true state of the case and I make no doubt but the knowledge of right and wrong is so truly impressed upon the mind of manthat did no such thing ever happen as that the conscience of a man by long habits of sin might as the scripture assures it may insensibly become hardand like some tender parts of his body by much stress and continual hard usage lose by degrees that nice sense and perception with which God and nature endow'd itDid this never happenor was it certain that selflove could never hang the least bias upon the judgmentor that the little interests below could rise up and perplex the faculties of our upper regions and  encompass them about with clouds and thick darknessCould no such thing as favour and affection enter this sacred COURTDid WIT disdain to take a bribe in itor was asham'd to shew its face as an advocate for an unwarrantable enjoymentOr lastly were we assured that INTEREST stood always unconcern'd whilst the cause was hearingand that passion never got into the judgmentseat and pronounc'd sentence in the stead of reason which is supposed always to preside and determine upon the caseWas this truly so as the objection must supposeno doubt then the religious and moral state of a man would be exactly what he himself esteem'd itand the guilt or innocence of every man's life could be known in general by no better measure than the degrees  of his own approbation and censure"  "I own in one case whenever a man's conscience does accuse him as it seldom errs on that side that he is guilty and unless in melancholy and hypocondriac cases we may safely pronounce upon it that there is always sufficient grounds for the accusation  "But the converse of the proposition will not hold truenamely that whenever there is guilt the conscience must accuse and if it does not that a man is therefore innocentThis is not factSo that the common consolation which some good christian or other is hourly administring to himselfthat he thanks God his mind does not misgive him and that consequently  he has a good conscience because he has a quiet oneis fallaciousand as current as the inference is and as infallible as the rule appears at first sight yet when you look nearer to it and try the truth of this rule upon plain factsyou see it liable to so much error from a false applicationthe principle upon which it goes so often pervertedthe whole force of it lost and sometimes so vilely cast away that it is painful to produce the common examples from human life which confirm the account  "A man shall be vicious and utterly debauched in his principlesexceptionable in his conduct to the world shall live shameless in the open commission of a sin which no reason or pretence can justifya sin by which  contrary to all the workings of humanity he shall ruin for ever the deluded partner of his guiltrob her of her best dowry and not only cover her own head with dishonourbut involve a whole virtuous family in shame and sorrow for her sakeSurely you will think conscience must lead such a man a troublesome lifehe can have no rest night or day from its reproaches  "Alas CONSCIENCE had something else to do all this time than break in upon him as  Elijah  reproached the God  Baal  this domestic God  was either talking    or pursuing    or was in a journey    or peradventure he slept and could not be awoke  "Perhaps HE was gone out in company with HONOUR to fight a duel  to pay off some debt at playor dirty annuity the bargain of his lust Perhaps CONSCIENCE all this time was engaged at home talking loud against petty larceny and executing vengeance upon some such puny crimes as his fortune and rank in life secured him against all temptation of committing so that he lives as merrily" If he was of our church tho' quoth Dr  Slop  he could not"sleeps as soundly in his bedand at last meets death as unconcernedlyperhaps much more so than a much better man"  All this is impossible with us quoth Dr  Slop  turning to my fatherthe case could not happen in our churchIt happens in ours however replied my father but too oftenI own quoth Dr  Slop  struck a little with my father's  frank acknowledgmentthat a man in the  Romish  church may live as badlybut then he cannot easily die so'Tis little matter replied my father with an air of indifferencehow a rascal diesI mean answer'd Dr  Slop  he would be denied the benefits of the last sacramentsPray how many have you in all said my uncle  Toby  for I always forgetSeven answered Dr  Slop  Humphsaid my uncle  Toby  tho' not accented as a note of acquiescencebut as an interjection of that particular species of surprize when a man in looking into a drawer finds more of a thing than he expectedHumph replied my uncle  Toby  Dr  Slop  who had an ear understood my uncle  Toby  as well as if he had wrote a whole volume against the seven sacramentsHumph replied Dr  Slop  stating my uncle  Toby  's argument over  again to himWhy Sir are there not seven cardinal virtuesSeven mortal sinsSeven golden candlesticksSeven heavens'Tis more than I know replied my uncle  Toby  Are there are not seven wonders of the worldSeven days of the creationSeven planetsSeven plaguesThat there are quoth my father with a most affected gravity But pri'thee continued he go on with the rest of thy characters  Trim    "Another is sordid unmerciful" here  Trim  waved his righthand "a straithearted selfish wretch incapable either of private friendship or public spirit Take notice how he passes by the widow and orphan in their distress and sees all the miseries incident to human life without a sigh or a prayer" And  please your Honours cried  Trim  I think this is a viler man than the other  "Shall not conscience rise up and sting him on such occasionsNo thank God there is no occasion  I pay every man his own    I have no fornication to answer to my conscience    no faithless vows or promises to make up    I have debauched no man's wife or child    thank God    I am not as other men    adulterers    unjust    or even as this libertine    who stands before me  "  "A third is crafty and designing in his nature View his whole life'tis nothing but a cunning contexture of dark arts and unequitable subterfuges basely to defeat the true intent of all lawsplain dealing and the safe enjoyment of our several properties  You will see such a one working out a frame of little designs upon the ignorance and perplexities of the poor and needy manshall raise a fortune upon the inexperience of a youth or the unsuspecting temper of his friend who would have trusted him with his life  "When old age comes on and repentance calls him to look back upon this black account and state it over again with his conscienceCONSCIENCE looks into the STATUTES at LARGEfinds no express law broken by what he has doneperceives no penalty or forfeiture of goods and chattels incurredsees no scourge waving over his head or prison opening his gates upon himWhat is there to affright his conscienceConscience  has got safely entrenched behind the Letter of the Law sits there invulnerable fortified with  Cases  and  Reports  so strongly on all sidesthat it is not preaching can dispossess it of its hold"  Here Corporal  Trim  and my uncle  Toby  exchanged looks with each otherAyeaye  Trim  quoth my uncle  Toby  shaking his headthese are but sorry fortifications  Trim  O very poor work answered  Trim  to what your Honour and I make of itThe character of this last man said Dr  Slop  interrupting  Trim  is more detestable than all the restand seems to have been taken from some pettifogging Lawyer amongst youAmongst us a man's conscience could not possibly continue so long  blinded  three times in  a year at least he must go to confession Will that restore it to sight quoth my uncle  Toby  Go on  Trim  quoth my father or  Obadiah  will have got back before thou hast got to the end of thy sermon'tis a very short one replied  Trim  I wish it was longer quoth my uncle  Toby  for I like it hugely  Trim  went on  "A fourth man shall want even this refugeshall break through all this ceremony of slow chicanescorns the doubtful workings of secret plots and cautious trains to bring about his purposeSee the barefaced villain how he cheats lies perjures robs murdersHorridBut indeed much better was not to be expected in the present casethe poor man was in the darkhis priest had got  the keeping of his conscienceand all he would let him know of it was That he must believe in the Popego to Masscross himselftell his beadsbe a good Catholic and that this in all conscience was enough to carry him to heaven Whatif he perjuresWhyhe had a mental reservation in itBut if he is so wicked and abandoned a wretch as you represent himif he robsif he stabswill not conscience on every such act receive a wound itself Ayebut the man has carried it to confessionthe wound digests there and will do well enough and in a short time be quite healed up by absolution O Popery what hast thou to answer forwhen not content with the too many natural and fatal ways thro' which the heart of man is  every day thus treacherous to itself above all thingsthou hast wilfully set open this wide gate of deceit before the face of this unwary traveller too apt God knows to go astray of himself and confidently speak peace to himself when there is no peace  "Of this the common instances which I have drawn out of life are too notorious to require much evidence If any man doubts the reality of them or thinks it impossible for a man to be such a bubble to himselfI must refer him a moment to his own reflections and will then venture to trust my appeal with his own heart  "Let him consider in how different a degree of detestation numbers of wicked actions stand  there  tho' equally  bad and vicious in their own natureshe will soon find that such of them as strong inclination and custom have prompted him to commit are generally dress'd out and painted with all the false beauties which a soft and a flattering hand can give themand that the others to which he feels no propensity appear at once naked and deformed surrounded with all the true circumstances of folly and dishonour  "When  David  surprized  Saul  sleeping in the cave and cut off the skirt of his robewe read his heart smote him for what he had doneBut in the matter of  Uriah  where a faithful and gallant servant whom he ought to have loved and honoured fell to make way for his lustwhere conscience  had so much greater reason to take the alarm his heart smote him not A whole year had almost passed from the first commission of that crime to the time  Nathan  was sent to reprove him and we read not once of the least sorrow or compunction of heart which he testified during all that time for what he had done  "Thus conscience this once able monitorplaced on high as a judge within us and intended by our maker as a just and equitable one tooby an unhappy train of causes and impediments takes often such imperfect cognizance of what passesdoes its office so negligentlysometimes so corruptlythat it is not to be trusted alone and therefore we find there is a necessity an absolute necessity of  joining another principle with it to aid if not govern its determinations  "So that if you would form a just judgment of what is of infinite importance to you not to be misled innamely in what degree of real merit you stand either as an honest man an useful citizen a faithful subject to your king or a good servant to your Godcall in religion and moralityLookWhat is written in the law of GodHow readest thouConsult calm reason and the unchangeable obligations of justice and truthwhat say they  "Let CONSCIENCE determine the matter upon these reportsand then if they heart condemns thee not which is the case the Apostle supposesthe  rule will be infallible" Here Dr  Slop  fell asleep "  thou wilt have confidence towards God  that is have just grounds to believe the judgment thou hast past upon thyself is the judgment of God and nothing else but an anticipation of that righteous sentence which will be pronounced upon thee hereafter by that Being to whom thou art finally to give an account of thy actions  "  Blessed is the man  indeed then as the author of the book of  Ecclesiasticus  expresses it  who is not prick'd with the multitude of his sins Blessed is the man whose heart hath not condemn'd him    whether he be rich    or whether he be poor    if he have a good heart  a heart thus guided and informed  he shall at all times rejoice in a chearful countenance    his mind shall tell him more than  seven watchmen that sit above upon a tower on high  "A tower has no strength quoth my uncle  Toby  unless 'tis flank'd "In the darkest doubts it shall conduct him safer than a thousand casuists and give the state he lives in a better security for his behaviour than all the clauses and restrictions put together which lawmakers are forced to multiply  Forced  I say as things stand human laws not being a matter of original choice but of pure necessity brought in to fence against the mischievous effects of those consciences which are no law unto themselves well intending by the many provisions madethat in all such corrupt and misguided cases where principles and the checks of conscience will not make us uprightto  supply their force and by the terrors of goals and halters oblige us to it"  I see plainly said my father that this sermon has been composed to be preached at the Templeor at some AssizeI like the reasoningand  sorry that Dr  Slop  has fallen asleep before the time of his convictionfor it is now clear that the Parson as I thought at first never insulted St  Paul  in the leastnor has there been brother the least difference between themA great matter if they had differed replied my uncle  Toby  the best friends in the world may differ sometimesTruebrother  Toby  quoth my father shaking hands with himwe'll fill our pipes brother and then  Trim  shall go on  Wellwhat dost thou think of it said my father speaking to Corporal  Trim  as he reach'd his tobaccobox  I think answer'd the Corporal that the seven watchmen upon the tower who I suppose are all centinels thereare more an' please your Honour than were necessaryand to go on at that rate would harrass a regiment all to pieces which a commanding officer who loves his men will never do if he can help it because two centinels added the Corporal are as good as twentyI have been a commanding officer myself in the  Corps de Garde  a hundred times continued  Trim  rising an inch higher in his figure as he spokeand all the time I had the honour to serve his Majesty King  William  in relieving the most considerable posts I never left more than two in my life  Very right  Trim  quoth my uncle  Toby  but you do not consider  Trim  that the towers in  Solomon  's days were not such things as our bastions flank'd and defended by other worksthis  Trim  was an invention since  Solomon  's death nor had they hornworks or ravelins before the curtin in his timeor such a fossé as we make with a cuvette in the middle of it and with cover'dways and counterscarps pallisadoed along it to guard against a  Coup de main  So that the seven men upon the tower were a party I dare say from the  Corps de Garde  set there not only to look out but to defend itThey could be no more an' please your Honour than a Corporal's GuardMy father smiled inwardlybut not outwardlythe subject between my uncle  Toby  and Corporal  Trim  being rather too serious considering what had  happened to make a jest ofSo putting his pipe into his mouth which he had just lightedhe contented himself with ordering  Trim  to read on He read on as follows  "To have the fear of God before our eyes and in our mutual dealings with each other to govern our actions by the eternal measures of right and wrongThe first of these will comprehend the duties of religionthe second those of morality which are so inseparably connected together that you cannot divide these two  tables  even in imagination tho' the attempt is often made in practice without breaking and mutually destroying them both  "I said the attempt is often made and so it isthere being nothing  more common than to see a man who has no sense at all of religionand indeed has so much honesty as to pretend to none who would take it as the bitterest affront should you but hint at a suspicion of his moral characteror imagine he was not conscientiously just and scrupulous to the uttermost mite  "When there is some appearance that it is sotho' one is unwilling even to suspect the appearance of so amiable a virtue as moral honesty yet were we to look into the grounds of it in the present case I am persuaded we should find little reason to envy such a one the honour of his motive  "Let him declaim as pompously as he chooses upon the subject it will  be found to rest upon no better foundation than either his interest his pride his ease or some such little and changeable passion as will give us but small dependance upon his actions in matters of great stress  "I will illustrate this by an example  "I know the banker I deal with or the physician I usually call in" There is no need cried Dr  Slop  waking to call in any physician in this case "to be neither of them men of much religion I hear them make a jest of it every day and treat all its sanctions with so much scorn as to put the matter past doubt Wellnotwithstanding this I put my fortune into the hands of the oneand what is dearer still to me  I trust my life to the honest skill of the other  "Now let me examine what is my reason for this great confidenceWhy in the first place I believe there is no probability that either of them will employ the power I put into their hands to my disadvantageI consider that honesty serves the purposes of this lifeI know their success in the world depends upon the fairness of their charactersIn a wordI'm persuaded that they cannot hurt me without hurting themselves more  "But put it otherwise namely that interest lay for once on the other side that a case should happen wherein the one without stain to his reputation could secrete my fortune and leave  me naked in the worldor that the other could send me out of it and enjoy an estate by my death without dishonour to himself or his artIn this case what hold have I of either of themReligion the strongest of all motives is out of the questionInterest the next most powerful motive in the world is strongly against meWhat have I left to cast into the opposite scale to balance this temptationAlas I have nothingnothing but what is lighter than a bubbleI must lay at the mercy of HONOUR or some such capricious principleStrait security for two of my most valuable blessingsmy property and my life  "As therefore we can have no dependence upon morality without religionso on the other hand there is  nothing better to be expected from religion without moralitynevertheless 'tis no prodigy to see a man whose real moral character stands very low who yet entertains the highest notion of himself in the light of a religious man  "He shall not only be covetous revengeful implacablebut even wanting in points of common honesty yet inasmuch as he talks aloud against the infidelity of the ageis zealous for some points of religiongoes twice a day to churchattends the sacramentsand amuses himself with a few instrumental parts of religionshall cheat his conscience into a judgment that for this he is a religious man and has discharged truly his duty to God  And you will find that such a man through force of this delusion generally looks down with spiritual pride upon every other man who has less affectation of pietythough perhaps ten times more moral honesty than himself  "  This likewise is a sore evil under the sun  and I believe there is no one mistaken principle which for its time has wrought more serious mischiefsFor a general proof of thisexamine the history of the  Romish  church"Well what can you make of that cried Dr  Slop  "see what scenes of cruelty murders rapines bloodshed" They may thank their own obstinacy cried Dr  Slop  "have all been sanctified by a religion not strictly governed by morality  "In how many kingdoms of the world" Here  Trim  kept waving his righthand from the sermon to the extent of his arm returning it backwards and forwards to the conclusion of the paragraph  "In how many kingdoms of the world has the crusading sword of this misguided sainterrant spared neither age or merit or sex or conditionand as he fought under the banners of a religion which set him loose from justice and humanity he shew'd none mercilessly trampled upon bothheard neither the cries of the unfortunate nor pitied their distresses"  I have been in many a battle an' please your Honour quoth  Trim  sighing but never in so melancholy a one as thisI would not have drawn a tricker  in it against these poor soulsto have been made a general officerWhy what do you understand of the affair said Dr  Slop  looking towards  Trim  with something more contempt than the Corporal's honest heart deservedWhat do you know friend about this battle you talk ofI know replied  Trim  that I never refused quarter in my life to any man who cried out for itbut to a woman or a child continued  Trim  before I would level my musket at them I would lose my life a thousand timesHere's a crown for thee  Trim  to drink with  Obadiah  tonight quoth my uncle  Toby  and I'll give  Obadiah  another tooGod bless your Honour replied  Trim  I had rather these poor women and children had itThou art an honest fellow quoth my uncle  Toby  My father nodded his  headas much as to sayand so he is  But pri'thee  Trim  said my father make an endfor I see thou hast but a leaf or two left  Corporal  Trim  read on  "If the testimony of past centuries in this matter is not sufficientconsider at this instant how the votaries of that religion are every day thinking to do service and honour to God by actions which are a dishonour and scandal to themselves  "To be convinced of this go with me for a moment into the prisons of the inquisition" God help my poor brother  Tom  "Behold  Religion  with  Mercy  and  Justice  chained down under her feetthere sitting ghastly upon a black tribunal propp'd up with racks and instruments of torment Harkhark what a piteous groan" Here  Trim  's face turned as pale as ashes "See the melancholy wretch who utter'd it"Here the tears began to trickle down "just brought forth to undergo the anguish of a mock trial and endure the utmost pains that a studied system of cruelty has been able to invent"D  n them all quoth  Trim  his colour returning into his face as red as blood"Behold this helpless victim delivered up to his tormentorshis body so wasted with sorrow and confinement"Oh 'tis my brother cried poor  Trim  in a most passionate exclamation dropping the sermon upon the ground and clapping his hands together  I fear 'tis poor  Tom  My father's and my uncle  Toby  's hearts yearn'd with sympathy for the poor fellow's distresseven  Slop  himself acknowledged pity for himWhy  Trim  said my father this is not a history'tis a sermon thou art readingpri'thee begin the sentence again"Behold this helpless victim deliver'd up to his tormentorshis body so wasted with sorrow and confinement you will see every nerve and muscle as it suffers  "Observe the last movement of that horrid engine" I would rather face a cannon quoth  Trim  stamping"See what convulsions it has thrown him intoConsider the nature of the posture in which he now lies stretchedwhat exquisite tortures he endures by it"I hope 'tis not in  Portugal  "'Tis all nature can bear Good God see how it keeps his weary soul hanging upon his trembling lips"  I would not read another line of it quoth  Trim  for all this worldI fear an' please your Honours all this is in  Portugal  where my poor brother  Tom  is I tell thee  Trim  again quoth my father 'tis not an historical account'tis a description'Tis only a description honest man quoth  Slop  there's not a word of truth in itThat's another story replied my fatherHowever as  Trim  reads it with so much concern'tis cruelty to force him to go on with itGive me hold of the sermon  Trim  I'll finish it for thee and thou mayst go I must stay and hear it too replied  Trim  if your Honour will allow metho' I would not read it myself for a Colonel's pay  Poor  Trim  quoth my uncle  Toby  My father went on  "Consider the nature of the posture in which he now lies stretch'dwhat exquisite torture he endures by it'Tis all nature can bearGood God See how it keeps his weary soul hanging upon his trembling lipswilling to take its leavebut not suffered to departBehold the unhappy wretch led back to his cell" Then thank God however quoth  Trim  they have not killed him"See him dragg'd out of it again to meet the flames and the insults in his last agonies which this principlethis principle that there can be religion without mercy has prepared for him" Then thank Godhe is dead quoth  Trim  he is  out of his painand they have done their worst at himO SirsHold your peace  Trim  said my father going on with the sermon lest  Trim  should incense Dr  Slop  we shall never have done at this rate  "The surest way to try the merit of any disputed notion is to trace down the consequences such a notion has produced and compare them with the spirit of Christianity'tis the short and decisive rule which our Saviour hath left us for these and suchlike cases and it is worth a thousand arguments  By their fruits ye shall know them  "I will add no further to the length of this sermon than by two or three  short and independent rules deducible from it  "  First  Whenever a man talks loudly against religionalways suspect that it is not his reason but his passions which have got the better of his CREED A bad life and a good belief are disagreeable and troublesome neighbours and where they separate depend upon it 'tis for no other cause but quietness sake  "  Secondly  When a man thus represented tells you in any particular instanceThat such a thing goes  against  his consciencealways believe he means exactly the same thing as when he tells you such a thing goes  against  his stomacha present want of appetite being generally the true cause of both  "In a wordtrust that man in nothing who has not a CONSCIENCE in every thing  "And in your own case remember this plain distinction a mistake in which has ruined thousandsthat your conscience is not a lawNo God and reason made the law and have placed conscience within you to determinenot like an  Asiatic  Cadi according to the ebbs and flows of his own passionsbut like a  British  judge in this land of liberty and good sense who makes no new law but faithfully declares that law which he knows already written"  FINIS  Thou hast read the sermon extremely well  Trim  quoth my fatherIf he had spared his comments replied Dr  Slop  he would have read it much better I should have read it ten times better Sir answered  Trim  but that my heart was so fullThat was the very reason  Trim  replied my father which has made thee read the sermon as well as thou hast done and if the clergy of our church continued my father addressing himself to Dr  Slop  would take part in what they deliver as deeply as this poor fellow has doneas their compositions are fine I deny it quoth Dr  Slop  I maintain it that the eloquence of our pulpits with such subjects to inflame itwould be a model for the whole worldBut alas continued my father and I own it Sir with sorrow that like  French  politicians in this respect what they gain in the cabinet  they lose in the field'Twere a pity quoth my uncle that this should be lost I like the sermon well replied my father'tis dramaticand there is something in that way of writing when skilfully managed which catches the attentionWe preach much in that way with us said Dr  Slop  I know that very well said my fatherbut in a tone and manner which disgusted Dr  Slop  full as much as his assent simply could have pleased himBut in this added Dr  Slop  a little piquedour sermons have greatly the advantage that we never introduce any character into them below a patriarch or a patriarch's wife or a martyr or a saintThere are some very bad characters in this however said my father and I do not think the sermon a jot the worse for 'emBut pray quoth my uncle  Toby  who's can this  beHow could it get into my  Stevinus  A man must be as great a conjurer as  Stevinus  said my father to resolve the second questionThe first I think is not so difficultfor unless my judgment greatly deceives meI know the author for 'tis wrote certainly by the parson of the parish  The similitude of the stile and manner of it with those my father constantly had heard preach'd in his parishchurch was the ground of his conjectureproving it as strongly as an argument  à priori  could prove such a thing to a philosophic mind That it was  Yorick  's and no one's elseIt was proved to be so  à posteriori  the day after when  Yorick  sent a servant to my uncle  Toby  's house to enquire after it  It seems that  Yorick  who was inquisitive after all kinds of knowledge had borrowed  Stevinus  of my uncle  Toby  and had carelesly popp'd his sermon as soon as he had made it into the middle of  Stevinus  and by an act of forgetfulness to which he was ever subject he had sent  Stevinus  home and his sermon to keep him company  Illfated sermon Thou wast lost after this recovery of thee a second time dropp'd thro' an unsuspected fissure in thy master's pocket down into a treacherous and a tatter'd liningtrod deep into the dirt by the left hind foot of his Rosinante inhumanly stepping upon thee as thou falledstburied ten days in the mireraised up out of it by a beggar sold for a halfpenny to a parishclerktransferred to his parsonlost for ever  to thy own the remainder of his daysnor restored to his restless MANES till this very moment that I tell the world the story  Can the reader believe that this sermon of  Yorick  's was preach'd at an assize in the cathedral of  York  before a thousand witnesses ready to give oath of it by a certain prebendary of that church and actually printed by him when he had doneand within so short a space as two years and three months after  Yorick  's death  Yorick  indeed was never better served in his lifebut it was a little hard to maletreat him after and plunder him after he was laid in his grave  However as the gentleman who did it was in perfect charity with  Yorick  and in conscious justice printed but a  few copies to give awayand that I am told he could moreover have made as good a one himself had he thought fitI declare I would not have published this anecdote to the worldnor do I publish it with an intent to hurt his character and advancement in the churchI leave that to othersbut I find myself impelled by two reasons which I cannot withstand  The first is That in doing justice I may give rest to  Yorick  's ghostwhich as the country peopleand some others believe  still walks  The second reason is That by laying open this story to the world I gain an opportunity of informing itThat in case the character of parson  Yorick  and this sample of his sermons is likedthat  there are now in the possession of the  Shandy  family as many as will make a handsome volume at the world's serviceand much good may they do it  CHAP XVIII  OBADIAH gain'd the two crowns without dispute for he came in jingling with all the instruments in the green bays bag we spoke of slung across his body just as Corporal  Trim  went out of the room  It is now proper I think quoth Dr  Slop  clearing up his looks as we are in a condition to be of some service to Mrs  Shandy  to send up stairs to know how she goes on  I have ordered answered my father the old midwife to come down to us upon the least difficultyfor you must know Dr  Slop  continued my father with a perplexed kind of a smile upon his countenance that by express treaty solemnly ratified between me and my wife you are no more than an auxiliary in this affairand not so much as thatunless the lean old mother of a midwife above stairs cannot do without youWomen have their particular fancies and in points of this nature continued my father where they bear the whole burden and suffer so much acute pain for the advantage of our families and the good of the speciesthey claim a right of deciding  en Soveraines  in whose hands and in what fashion they chuse to undergo it  They are in the right of itquoth my uncle  Toby  But Sir replied Dr  Slop  not taking notice of my uncle  Toby  's opinion but turning to my fatherthey had better govern in other pointsand a father of a family who wished its perpetuity in my opinion had better exchange this prerogative with them and give up some other rights in lieu of itI know not quoth my father answering a little too testily to be quite dispassionate in what he saidI know not quoth he what we have left to give up in lieu of who shall bring our children into the worldunless thatof who shall beget themOne would almost give up any thing replied Dr  Slop  I beg your pardonanswered my uncle  Toby  Sir replied Dr  Slop  it would astonish you to know what Improvements we have made of late years in all branches  of obstetrical knowledge but particularly in that one single point of the safe and expeditious extraction of the  foetus  which has received such lights that for my part holding up his hands I declare I wonder how the world hasI wish quoth my uncle  Toby  you had seen what prodigious armies we had in  Flanders  CHAP XIX  I Have dropp'd the curtain over this scene for a minuteto remind you of one thingand to inform you of another  What I have to inform you comes I own a little out of its due coursefor it should have been told a hundred and  fifty pages ago but that I foresaw then 'twould come in pat hereafter and be of more advantage here than elsewhereWriters had need look before them to keep up the spirit and connection of what they have in hand  When these two things are donethe curtain shall be drawn up again and my uncle  Toby  my father and Dr  Slop  shall go on with their discourse without any more interruption  First then the matter which I have to remind you of is thisthat from the specimens of singularity in my father's notions in the point of Christiannames and that other point previous theretoyou was led I think into an opinion and I am sure I said as much that my father was a gentleman altogether as odd  and whimsical in fifty other opinions In truth there was not a stage in the life of man from the very first act of his begettingdown to the lean and slipper'd pantaloon in his second childishness but he had some favourite notion to himself springing out of it as sceptical and as far out of the highway of thinking as these two which have been explained  Mr  Shandy  my father Sir would see nothing in the light in which others placed ithe placed things in his own lighthe would weigh nothing in common scalesnohe was too refined a researcher to lay open to so gross an impositionTo come at the exact weight of things in the scientific steelyard the fulcrum he would say should be almost invisible to avoid all friction from popular tenetswithout this the minutiae  of philosophy which should always turn the balance will have no weight at allKnowledge like matter he would affirm was divisible  in infinitum  that the grains and scruples were as much a part of it as the gravitation of the whole worldIn a word he would say error was errorno matter where it fellwhether in a fractionor a pound'twas alike fatal to truth and she was kept down at the bottom of her well as inevitably by a mistake in the dust of a butterfly's wingas in the disk of the sun the moon and all the stars of heaven put together  He would often lament that it was for want of considering this properly and of applying it skilfully to civil matters as well as to speculative truths that so many things in this world were out of jointthat the political arch was giving way  and that the very foundations of our excellent constitution in church and state were so sapp'd as estimators had reported  You cry out he would say we are a ruined undone peopleWhy he would ask making use of the sorites or fyllogism of  Zeno  and  Chrysippus  without knowing it belonged to themWhy why are we a ruined peopleBecause we are corruptedWhence is it dear Sir that we are corruptedBecause we are needyour poverty and not our wills consentAnd wherefore he would addare we needyFrom the neglect he would answer of our pence and our halfpenceOur banknotes Sir our guineasnay our shillings take care of themselves  'Tis the same he would say throughout the whole circle of the sciences  the great the established points of them are not to be broke in uponThe laws of nature will defend themselvesbut errorhe would add looking earnestly at my mothererror Sir creeps in thro' the minute holes and small crevices which human nature leaves unguarded  This turn of thinking in my father is what I had to remind you ofThe point you are to be informed of and which I have reserved for this place is as follows  Amongst the many and excellent reasons with which my father had urged my mother to accept of Dr  Slop  's assistance preferably to that of the old womanthere was one of a very singular nature which when he had done arguing the matter with her as a Christian and came to argue it over again with her  as a philosopher he had put his whole strength to depending indeed upon it as his sheet anchorIt failed him tho' from no defect in the argument itself but that do what he could he was not able for his soul to make her comprehend the drift of itCursed lucksaid he to himself one afternoon as he walk'd out of the room after he had been stating it for an hour and a half to her to no manner of purposecursed luck said he biting his lip as he shut the doorfor a man to be master of one of the finest chains of reasoning in natureand have a wife at the same time with such a headpiece that he cannot hang up a single inference within side of it to save his soul from destruction  This argument tho' it was intirely lost upon my motherhad more weight with  him than all his other arguments joined togetherI will therefore endeavour to do it justiceand set it forth with all the perspicuity I am master of  My father set out upon the strength of these two following axioms  First  That an ounce of a man's own wit was worth a tun of other peoples and  Secondly  Which by the bye was the groundwork of the first axiomtho' it comes last That every man's wit must come from every man's own souland no other body's  Now as it was plain to my father that all souls were by nature equaland that the great difference between the most acute and the most obtuse understanding  was from no original sharpness or bluntness of one thinking substance above or below anotherbut arose merely from the lucky or unlucky organization of the body in that part where the soul principally took up her residencehe had made it the subject of his enquiry to find out the identical place  Now from the best accounts he had been able to get of this matter he was satisfied it could not be where  Des Cartes  had fixed it upon the top of the  pineal  gland of the brain which as he philosophised formed a cushion for her about the size of a marrow pea tho' to speak the truth as so many nerves did terminate all in that one place'twas no bad conjectureand my father had certainly fallen with that great philosopher plumb into the center of the mistake had it not  been for my uncle  Toby  who rescued him out of it by a story he told him of a  Walloon  officer at the battle of  Landen  who had one part of his brain shot away by a musketballand another part of it taken out after by a  French  surgeon and after all recovered and did his duty very well without it  If death said my father reasoning with himself is nothing but the separation of the soul from the bodyand if it is true that people can walk about and do their business without brainsthen certes the soul does not inhabit there Q E D  As for that certain very thin subtle and very fragrant juice which  Coglionissimo Borri  the great  Milaneze  physician affirms in a letter to  Bartholine  to have discovered in the cellulae of the occipital parts  of the cerebellum and which he likewise affirms to be the principal seat of the reasonable soul for you must know in these latter and more enlightened ages there are two souls in every man livingthe one according to the great  Metheglingius  being called the  Animus  the other the  Anima  as for this opinion I say of  Borri  my father could never subscribe to it by any means the very idea of so noble so refined so immaterial and so exalted a being as the  Anima  or even the  Animus  taking up her residence and sitting dabbling like a tadpole all day long both summer and winter in a puddleor in a liquid of any kind how thick or thin soever he would say shock'd his imagination he would scarce give the doctrine a hearing  What therefore seem'd the least liable to objections of any was that the chief  sensorium or headquarters of the soul and to which place all intelligences were referred and from whence all her mandates were issuedwas in or near the cerebellumor rather somewhere about the  medulla oblongata  wherein it was generally agreed by  Dutch  anatomists that all the minute nerves from all the organs of the seven senses concentered like streets and winding alleys into a square  So far there was nothing singular in my father's opinionhe had the best of philosophers of all ages and climates to go along with himBut here he took a road of his own setting up another  Shandean  hypothesis upon these cornerstones they had laid for himand which said hypothesis equally stood its ground whether the subtilty and fineness of the soul depended upon the temperature and clearness  of the said liquor or of the finer network and texture in the cerebellum itself which opinion he favoured  He maintained that next to the due care to be taken in the act of propagation of each individual which required all the thought in the world as it laid the foundation of this incomprehensible contexture in which wit memory fancy eloquence and what is usually meant by the name of good natural parts do consistthat next to this and his Christianname which were the two original and most efficacious causes of allthat the third cause or rather what logicians call the  Causa sine quâ non  and without which all that was done was of no manner of significancewas the preservation of this delicate and finespun web from the havock which was generally made in it by  the violent compression and crush which the head was made to undergo by the nonsensical method of bringing us into the world by that part foremost  This requires explanation  My father who dipp'd into all kinds of books upon looking into  Lithopaedus Senonesis de Partu difficili  The author is here twice mistakenfor  Lithopaedus  should be wrote thus  Lithopaedii Senonensis Icon  The second mistake is that this  Lithopaedus  is not an author but a drawing of a petrified child The account of this published by  Albosius  may be seen at the end of  Cordaeus  's works in  Spachius  Mr  Tristram Shandy  has been led into this error either from seeing  Lithopaedus  's name of late in a catalogue of learned writers in Dr  or by mistaking  Lithopaedus  for  Trinecavellius  from the too great similitude of the names  published by  Adrianus Smelvgot  had found out That the lax and pliable state of a child's head in parturition the bones of the cranium having no futures at that time was suchthat by force of the woman's efforts which in strong labourpains was equal upon an average to a weight of pounds averdupoise acting perpendicularly upon itit so happened that in instances out of the said head was compressed and moulded into the shape of an oblong conical piece of dough such as a pastrycook generally rolls up in order to make a pye ofGood God cried my father what havock and destruction must this make in the infinitely fine and tender texture of the cerebellumOr if there is such a juice as  Borri  pretendsis it not enough to make the clearest liquor in the world both feculent and mothery  But how great was his apprehension when he further understood that this force acting upon the very vertex of the head not only injured the brain itself or cerebrumbut that it necessarily squeez'd and propell'd the cerebrum towards the cerebellum which was the immediate seat of the understandingAngels and Ministers of grace defend us cried my fathercan any soul withstand this shockNo wonder the intellectual web is so rent and tatter'd as we see it and that so many of our best heads are no better than a puzzled skein of silkall perplexityall confusion within side  But when my father read on and was let into the secret that when a child was turn'd topsyturvy which was easy for an operator to do and was extracted by the feetthat instead of the cerebrum  being propell'd towards the cerebellum the cerebellum on the contrary was propell'd simply towards the cerebrum where it could do no manner of hurtBy heavens cried he the world is in a conspiracy to drive out what little wit God has given usand the professors of the obstetric art are listed into the same conspiracyWhat is it to me which end of my son comes foremost into the world provided all goes right after and his cerebellum escapes uncrushed  It is the nature of an hypothesis when once a man has conceived it that it assimilates every thing to itself as proper nourishment and from the first moment of your begetting it it generally grows the stronger by every thing you see hear read or understand This is of great use  When my father was gone with this about a month there was scarce a phaenomenon of stupidity or of genius which he could not readily solve by itit accounted for the eldest son being the greatest blockhead in the familyPoor devil he would sayhe made way for the capacity of his younger brothersIt unriddled the observation of drivellers and monstrous headsshewing  à priori  it could not be otherwiseunless * * * * I don't know what It wonderfully explain'd and accounted for the acumen of the  Asiatic  genius and that sprightlier turn and a more penetrating intuition of minds in warmer climates not from the loose and commonplace solution of a clearer sky and a more perpetual sunshine  c  which for aught he knew might as well rarify and dilute the faculties of the soul into nothing by one extremeas they  are condensed in colder climates by the otherbut he traced the affair up to its springheadshew'd that in warmer climates nature had laid a lighter tax upon the fairest parts of the creationtheir pleasures morethe necessity of their pains less insomuch that the pressure and resistance upon the vertex was so slight that the whole organization of the cerebellum was preservednay he did not believe in natural births that so much as a single thread of the network was broke or displacedso that the soul might just act as she liked  When my father had got so farwhat a blaze of light did the accounts of the  Caesarian  section and of the towering geniuses who had come safe into the world by it cast upon this hypothesis Here you see he would say there was no injury done to the sensoriumno pressure  of the head against the pelvisno propulsion of the cerebrum towards the cerebellum either by the  os pubis  on this side or the  os coxcygis  on thatand pray what were the happy consequences Why Sir your  Julius Caesar  who gave the operation a nameand your  Hermes Trismegistus  who was born so before ever the operation had a nameyour  Scipio Africanus  your  Manlius Torquatus  our  Edward  the Sixthwho had he lived would have done the same honour to the hypothesisThese and many more who figur'd high in the annals of fameall came  sideway  Sir into the world  This incision of the  abdomen  and  uterus  ran for six weeks together in my father's headhe had read and was satisfied that wounds in the  epigastrium  and those in the  matrix  were not mortalso that the belly of the mother might be  opened extremely well to give a passage to the childHe mentioned the thing one afternoon to my mothermerely as a matter of factbut seeing her turn as pale as ashes at the very mention of it as much as the operation flattered his hopeshe thought it as well to say no more of itcontenting himself with admiringwhat he thought was to no purpose to propose  This was my father Mr  Shandy  's hypothesis concerning which I have only to add that my brother  Bobby  did as great honour to it whatever he did to the family as any one of the great heroes we spoke ofFor happening not only to be christen'd as I told you but to be born too when my father was at  Epsom  being moreover my mother's  first  childcoming into the world with his head  foremost  and turning out afterwards a  lad of wonderful slow partsmy father spelt all these together into his opinion and as he had failed at one endhe was determined to try the other  This was not to be expected from one of the sisterhood who are not easily to be put out of their wayand was therefore one of my father's great reasons in favour of a man of science whom he could better deal with  Of all men in the world Dr  Slop  was the fittest for my father's purposefor though his newinvented forceps was the armour he had proved and what he maintained to be the safest instrument of deliveranceyet it seems he had scattered a word or two in his book in favour of the very thing which ran in my father's fancytho' not with a view to the soul's good in extracting by the feet  as was my father's systembut for reasons merely obstetrical  This will account for the coalition betwixt my father and Dr  Slop  in the ensuing discourse which went a little hard against my uncle  Toby  In what manner a plain man with nothing but common sense could bear up against two such allies in scienceis hard to conceiveYou may conjecture upon it if you pleaseand whilst your imagination is in motion you may encourage it to go on and discover by what causes and effects in nature it could come to pass that my uncle  Toby  got his modesty by the wound he received upon his groinYou may raise a system to account for the loss of my nose by marriage articlesand shew the world how it could happen that I should have the misfortune to be called TRISTRAM in opposition to my father's  hypothesis and the wish of the whole family Godfathers and Godmothers not exceptedThese with fifty other points left yet unraveled you may endeavour to solve if you have timebut I tell you beforehand it will be in vainfor not the sage  Alquise  the magician in Don  Belianis  of  Greece  nor the no less famous  Urganda  the sorceress his wife were they alive could pretend to come within a league of the truth  The reader will be content to wait for a full explanation of these matters till the next yearwhen a series of things will be laid open which he little expects  END of the  SECOND VOLUME
