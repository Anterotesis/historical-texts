 A SCHOOL FOR GREYBEARDS OR THE MOURNING BRIDE A COMEDY IN FIVE ACTS AS PERFORMED AT THE THEATRE ROYAL DRURYLANE  BY MRS COWLEY  LONDON PRINTED FOR G G J AND J ROBINSON PATERNOSTERROW  MDCCLXXXVI  Price One Shilling and Sixpence  AN ADDRESS  I OFFER the following Comedy to the public under a circumstance which has given my mind the most exquisite uneasiness On the morning after the first representation it was observed by the papers that there had been persons present at the Theatre the preceding evening who went there  determined  to disapprove at all events From such a determination it is hard indeed to escape And the opposition intended was justified it seems by the indecency of some of the expressions From such a charge I feel it impossible to defend myself for against an imputation like this even  vindication  becomes disgraceful  As I was not at the Theatre I should have had some difficulty in understanding at what passages the objections were levelled had not one of the papers recorded them with many cruel remarks The particulars which were thus pointed out will I trust be a sufficient apology for themselves In the following pages they are  all  restored that the public AT LARGE may have the power to adjudge me as well as that small part of it confined within the walls of a Theatre  These passages have not been restored from any pertinacious opinion of their beauty for other expressions might have conveyed my intention as well but had I allowed one line to stand as altered for the stage what might not that reprobated line have been supposed to express I shrink from the idea And therefore most solemnly aver that the Comedy as now printed contains EVERY WORD which was opposed the first night from the suspicion of indelicacy hoping their  obvious  meaning only will be attended to without the coarse ingenuity of strained explanations which  have been made by persons who seem desirous to surround my task of dramatic writing with as many difficulties as possible  A celebrated Critic more attended to for the discrimination and learning which appear in his strictures than for their  lenity  in his observations on the Greybeards has the following  When Mrs Cowley gets possession of the spirit and turn of a character she speaks the language of  that  character better than  any  of her dramatic cotemporaries  This I confess I hold to be very high praise and it is to this very praise which my cotemporaries resolve I shall have no claim They will allow me indeed to draw strong character but it must be without speaking its language I may give vulgar o  low bred persons but they must converse in a stile of elegance I may design the coariest manners or the most disgusting folly but its expressions must not deviate from the line of  politeness Surely it would be as just to exact from the Artists who are painting the Gallery of Shakespeare that they should compleat their designs without the use of light and shade  It cannot be the  Poet  's mind which the public desire to trace in dramatic representation but the mind of the  characters  and the truth of their colouring Yet in my case it seems resolved that the point to be considered is not whether that  dotard  or that  pretender  or that  coquet  would so have given their feelings but whether Mrs  Cowley  ought so to have expressed herself  This is a criterion which happily no author is subjected to but those of the drama The Novelist may use the boldest tints seizing Nature for her guide she may dart through every rank of society drag forth not only the accomplished but the ignorant the coarse and the vulgarrich display them in their strongest colours and snatch immortality both for them and for herself I on  the contrary feel encompassed with chains when I write which check me in my happiest flights and force me continually to reflect not whether  this is just  but whether  this is safe  These are vain regrets which I hope my readers will pardon me for having a moment indulged I now hasten to that part of the Comedy which will be found in the following sheets as  altered  for the second representation  The idea of the business which concerns Antonia Henry and Gasper was presented to me in an obsolete Comedy the work of a poet of the drama once highly celebrated I say the  idea  for when it is known that in the original the scene lay amongst traders in the city of Londonand those traders of the lowest and most detestable manners it will be conceived at once that in removing it to Portugal and fixing the characters amongst the nobility it was hardly possible to carry with me  more  than the idea The circumstance which most particularly interested me  and fixed itself in my mind was that of snatching a young woman from a hateful marriage the moment before that marrige became validthat is to say after the ceremony This very circumstance to which the Comedy owes its existence was that which some of the audience found discordant to their feelings An event which had in the last century been stampt with the highest applause tho' surrounded by many repulsive circumstances was found in this to be illconceived I did not however dispute the decision of my Criticsand the marriage has been in course dissolved  The manner in which the Comedy has since been received gives room to suppose that the alteration is approved It has struggled with many oppressive circumstances the chasm in the performance occasioned by the repeated illness of Mr Parsons was sufficient to have sunk itbut neither that nor the sterile month of December always  against  the Theatres has prevented its being distinguished by many brilliant and crouded  nights I now resign it to the closet where without the aid of fine acting or the fascinations of beauty and deriving all its little force from the pen which composed it it hopes still to amusethe innocent flame of Seraphina's coquetry may still shed rays of delight on her readers and the affecting situation of Antonia interest them  H COWLEY  PROLOGUE  BY MR COBB  SPOKEN BY MR BANNISTER JUN  PROLOGUES like mirrors which opticians place  In their shop windows to reflect each

dine with Don Gasper today previous to the wedding ceremony  Jaquez  YesGad the bride will be well match'd there's hardly a richer man in Lisbon  Pedrillo  Well married you meanas to the match you might have made a better between a canary bird and a jackalantern Sixtyfive and eighteen is a union full as vapoury and unnatural  Jaquez  Now you have done it Prithee who can that stranger be so muffled up without  Pedrillo  I know nothe takes as much pains to hide his face as tho' he had stol'n it  Jaquez  Sillystol'n faces are always shewn off the most boldly witness our Ladies after they have been robbing the rouge pots But as to this stranger he says he comes from our Master's friend Don Henry  Pedrillo  Hah does he so What that Don Henry who was obliged to fly for having fought a duel  Jaquez  The same Hang me if I'd be playing at hideandseek in foreign lands for drawing a little blood I'd go boldly to court and ask to speak to the Queen's Majesty and fall upon my knees and say  Pedrillo  Hist here comes Don Sebastian    Enter  Sebastian  Here is a stranger waiting without Sir  Sebas  Who is he  Pedrillo  Truly Sir I can't discover I have question'd and cross question'd him to no purpose he's as dexterous at shifting an answer as tho' he was fosterbrother to a lawyer  Jaquez  But he says Sir he came from Don Henryhe who was oblig'd to fly his country for challenging the  Sebas  Hah Where is he    going to the wing    No bring him hitherbring him instantly The brave unfortunate Don Henry This hour will be to him the heaviest of his life    he enters    Welcome Sir the friend of Don Henry cannot find a house in Portugal where he would be more joyfully received  Henry  What Sir dare you thus receive the friend of a banish'd manof a man who were he seen in Lisbon would have his head claimed the next hour by the executioner If thus you can receive his friend how will you receive himself    Throwing open his cloak    Sebas  In my arms and in my heart I re no I do not rejoice Oh Don Henry what imprudence How dare you venture hither before your pardon has been obtained  Henry  Could you suppose the intelligence of Antonia's marriage would suffer me to rest in any other spot that the proud sun visits Had I been beneath the zone from whence he pours his broadest rays or in the dusky regions of Cimmeria such intelligence must have impell'd me hither  Sebas  And to what purpose Surely this is a sort of Quixotism that must end like the sublime Knight's contention with the windmills  Henry  I care not how it ends The displeasure of my sovereign and my heart torn by the ingratitude of the woman on whom it doatsthe sooner the end approaches the better  Sebas  I am not now to learn how hard it is to stem the torrent of your passionsyet if you would be patient all might be wellAt least I trust so tho' my visit to England at that period prevented my knowing precisely the ground of your quarrel  Henry  Quarrel    with contempt    Do you then suspect it was  a fray  in which I fought or that my sword is drawn in tavern brawls or to support the insolence or perfidy of an abandoned wanton Duels of that sort a soldier stoops not to  Sebas  Pray then inform  Henry  I fought to punish the slanderer of him who taught me  how  to fightthe brave D'Almeida that once conquering hero  Sebas  I knew him well  Henry  'Twas he first plac'd a sword upon my youthful thigh and drawing forth the burnish'd blade never my Henry said the hoary general "never be its lustre stain'd except to serve your king or vindicate your friend These are the outlines of a soldier's dutywould you be a perfect soldier Labour to be an exemplary man" with  that  swordI thank it    holding his sword and bending over it    I punish'd  his  traducer  Sebas  Surely you cannot doubt of pardon  Henry  But whilst I wait for pardon in another kingdom my Antonia's lostoh  Sebas  Is she not already lost  Henry  No she is notand by heaven she shall not She's my contracted wifeno power on earth can make her another's whilst I live  Sebas  All this my friend only proves the bitter excess of your disappointmenthave you any settled scheme  Henry  I haveAt Madrid it chanc'd that Don Julio nephew to old Gasper my rival conceived a warm attachment for meFrom him I learnt the news of this abhorr'd marriagethe agonies it threw me in he compassionated and formed a scheme which wears a face of success  Sebas  Alasit iswell but pray go on  Henry  Learning that my person was unknown to Don Gasper whose retired life throws him out of all public circles Julio conceived the resolution to make me pass for himself  Sebas  You to pass for Don Gasper's nephew well  Henry  With this view he pretended an ardent desire to visit Portugal His father has in course written to Don Gasper we both arrived last night and Julio has given me the letter which will fix me in the house of my rival to prevent by whatever means that may offer themselves the design upon my honourthe robbery of my wife  Sebas  My dear unhappy Henry summon your fortitude whilst I tell you that Don Julio's friendship united with your own temerity cannot save your honour if your honour is to be wounded by    shaking his head    Henry  What's that oh speak Sebastianmy apprehensions choak me  Sebas  I cannot give found to words so cruel but fly and save that life which if you are discovered here must be forfeited  Henry  HahI understand youshe's married she's married Antonia is another's Oh Sebastian let me breathe    throwing himself on Sebastian    Sebas  Courage man if you would but swear a little now and give all the sex black brown and yellow to the devil I should have some hopes of you  Henry  Oh  Sebas  There's no bearing this a fine young fellow yielding himself to despair at the very moment his perfidious mistress is giving herself to another This very day she weds Don Gasper  Henry  This very day said'st thouoh speak it again Sebastian bless me with the sound is it this very day  Sebas  Alas he's mad  Henry  Oh no if it be  but  this day there yet are hopes  Sebas  She is now in the house of your rival According to the custom of our country she this morning went there attended by her bridemaids and in the evening old Gasper receives her vows  Henry  They are minein the face of heaven and before witnesses they are mineif she has given them to another they cannot be valid but by my assent I'll fly instantly to the house    going    Sebas  Nay suffer me to attend you for tho' I have dear and tender cares of my own I shall scarcely be awake to them whilst my friend is in such danger  Don Henry  Oh Sebastian the bliss or misery of all my years to come must be determined before the approaching night hath told out half its hours The enterprize is difficult is full of danger but what danger can be formidable to a wretch who precipitated on a gulph must leap it or be lost  Exeunt  SCENE  changes to  Don Gasper's  He enters meeting Rachel  Don Gasper  Well Rachel how is my little girl how is the bride Are her spirits got up What does she doWhat does she say  Rachel  Oh lord Sir she says but little and as to doing a half stifled sigh pops out now and then or else she's as still as an ivory statute  Don Gasp  Statute  but why don't you talk to her then  Mrs Statute  and tell her how happy  she is You should say d'ye see ma'am what a fine house you are mistress ofd'ye see ma'am how many servants are at your commandand this rich casket of jewels ma'am which my master presents to youhow many ladies will envy you these jewelsDid not her eyes sparkle when she found e'm on her toilet  Rachel  No Sir but they glitter'dfor there was a tear in each  Don Gasp  Tear ay tears of joy to be sure  Rachel  The bridemaids and the rest of the ladies endeavour'd all they could to divert her but to no purposeso I up and saidsays I laws ma'am you are the happiest lady in Portugal My master is the most agreeablest man for an oldI mean a middleaged gentlemanthat was the word indeed Sir for a middleaged gentleman in all the world He's never out of temper nor peevish except when he has got the gout  Don Gasp  Pshaw  Rachel  Then says I Ma'am as to wrinkles Lord what signifies minding a few wrinkles Why in forty years Ma'am you'll be as wrinkley as he is  Don Gasp  What the devil did you talk to her of wrinkles for Wrinkles to be sure I have the crow's feet about my eyes but many men have them before they are thirty  Rachel  That's true Then says I as to my Master's teeth Ma'am they are as white and even and polish'd ay as your Ladyship's And so they are you know Sirthey have been home but a fortnight  Don Gasp  Zounds Get into the kitchen and go near your Lady no more Was there ever such a stupid chattering  Rachel  It's nuts to me to sting him for I pity the poor young creature from my soul  Exit  Don Gasp  I don't know whether it is stupidity or archness in the wenchI am afraid she means to laugh at me Hang me if I would have married at all if my son would have married but families must be kept up and nothing can persuade that young dog into the trammelshe'd rather turn monk than turn to matrimony    Enter servant    Well you saw your Lady honest Peter  Peter  Yes Sir  Don Gasp  Ahwellwellisn't she a pretty tight thing Look in the gardenthere she trips there she trips  Peter  With submission Sir I wish

of spirits  Don Gasp  What care I for what your young master thinks or you either you old  Exit servant    Enter  Octavio  Octavio  Joy to you Sir joy on this festive morn but by the way it is very ill dress'd for a bridal mornthe same dusky blue it has worn this fortnight nor has the sun been at the expence of one ray extraordinary All nature should have been in gala on such an event as your nuptials But where is my mother I came eagerly to pay my duty  Don Gasp  Mother Gad it will look odd to see such a strapper as you call her mother  Octavio  Shall it be mamma Sir  Don Gasp  No  Madam  that's grave and comely Madam has a distant sound in ityou shall call her madam But instead of coming dutifully to congratulate me Sir why did you not dutifully marry yourself  Octavio  Faith Sir of all the duties fate has imposed upon a man I think that the hardest  Don Gasp  'Tis an imposition that some hundred dozen of your greatgrandsires as wise and as witty as your worship have submitted to  Octavio  'Tis devilish strange that it was necessary for so many great men to play the fool to bring me into existence  Don Gasp  There's Don Alexis d'Alva has been half mad to give you his daughterever since your return from Italy  Octavio  Ay had I had the grace to humour him Sir how happy for your fair Antonia She might have become at the same moment a virgin bride and a grandmamma    Drawling    Don Gasp  Pshawnonsense  Octavio  However Sir let her not despairshe may hope for the honour of being a  grand  mother yet I refused the daughter of Don Alexis without having seen her but now that I have seen her I think I could venture to exchange my dear prized liberty for captivity with her  Don Gasp  Say you so my boy Its the happiest news that I have heard But where could you see her for Don Alexis is so nicely jealous that if his stone walls had eyes he'd never suffer either his wise or daughter to unveil before them  Octavio  I saw her at church with her father The sermon was on Christian charity and to shew  how well she could illustrate the doctrine she lifted her veil on that side next mefor she saw me hungering and thirsting for a view  Don Gasp  MemorandumMy wife never goes to church  Octavio  You shock me SirWhat is my dear mamma to turn heathen  Don Gasp  No SirI'll read homilies to her and she shall have prayers at home  Enter Servant  Serv  Don Alexis de

civilities You wish me joy as tho' you hoped it would be sorrow and congratulate with an air of reproach  Don Alexis  Air of a fiddlestick's end Why didn't ye ask my advice Could any body have given ye better Have I not done the same thing have I not made an old ass of myself by marrying a girl  Don Gasp  Never mind that if your girl does not transform your assship's ears to horns  Don Alexis  Ay that's a blessed fear to be goaded with in the last stage of one's mortal journey  I wish the day I left my bed to marry I had been confined in it with a gout an asthma and a dropsy Oons man there's no end of your plagues from this moment  Don Gasp  Pray keep your temper nowkeep your temper 'Tis a very bad one but pray keep it however  Don Alexis  Why you'd find it easier to spin cables out of cobwebs or to pierce thro' the earth and swim out at the Antipodes than to manage a young rantipole wife and so your servantI give ye joymuch good may it do you  going  Don Gasp  Stay stay a moment man and tell me which is the greatest torment a young wife or daughter  Don Alexis  Oh lord why a daughter is a seventh day ague and a wife is a frenzy fever  Don Gasp  Well come I'll recommend ye a physician for your ague  Don Alexis  A physicianWhat d'ye mean  Don Gasp  Why a lover to take your daughter off your hands  Don Alexis  Who'll be the bold man to do that  Don Gasp  An impudent young rascal six feet and a half high who upon such authority as husbands are obliged to take calls me father if you like it he may call  you  so  Don Alexis  What Octavio Will he be my doctor Octavio marry my daughterBut perhaps this is a wedding day joke of yours old Signor Gad you'll find this day's work no joke believe me  Don Gasp  If its a joke you have it but at second hand the original inventor

neighbour's  Lady  The bride's pensiveness infects us Sir Mirth seems to be impertinent  Antonia  Oh pardon me Were my spirits obedient to my wishes your reproach would have been undeserved but tho' we can determine how to  act  I find we cannot determine how to  feel    Don Gasp  Feel feel When I was a youngster women had no such word in their vocabulary Can't you leave your feelings alone Never

Aside    Not one chance look this  way and yet I can forgive the sweet averted eye because it speaks disgust to all around her  Antonia  You know the cause I have for sorrow and have allowed it yet my

married  Donna Clara  Truly I think so Signor or I am not a bridemaid but how far faithless I know notfor I return'd from Arragon last night after more than a year's absence We met but an hour since in the church nor have we yet had time for conversation  Don Henry  Then I entreat you let this discovery rest with yourselfIt is of the last importance to me that I should not be known to Don Gasper and at present I would be equally concealed from Antonia  Donna Clara  You must give me reasons for this request for I am not certain that I ought not instantly to betray you It is true you have been her lover but she is now to be the wife of Don Gasperher duties to him will be of the most sacred sort and she must fulfil them scrupulously  Don Henry  Think me not a seducer I have lov'd Antonia for her purity and virtue and to destroy  her  honour would be to trample on my own Oh Clara few have lov'd as I do My passion is mingled with the tender protecting affection of a brother and violation is impossible  Donna Clara  Pray then tell me  Don Henry  You shall know alland should Antonia's marriage be voluntary I will take no revenge but to leave herbut if as her melancholy allows me to hope she has been deceiv'd into it there's not a power on earth that can divide us  Donna Clara  If your design is not contrary to rectitude be assured I shall not oppose it Follow me to a more distant rooma new secret is almost as delightful as a new lover  Exeunt  END of the FIRST ACT  ACT II An Apartment at Don Alexis's  Enter Seraphina pulling in Alexis  Seraphina  COME along my charming husband Bless me what eloquence and fire considering you are fiftynine I protest a man thirty years younger could hardly have found such a variety of things to have said on so trivial a subject One might mistake you for an English senator instead of a Portugueze privy counsellor you can say so much upon nothing  Alex  Nothing what is it nothing that whenever I go out of the door your head is directly out of the windowlike the sign of Queen Jezebel 'Tis known to all the impudent young facehunters in Lisbon who saunter about my gates like wolves before a sheepfoldd'ye call that nothing  Seraph  Oh no Heaven forbid I should be so ungrateful towards the grand pleasure of my life Nothing 'tis  every thing  my happiness I wait for sunset every day with impatience because 'tis known that I then mount my thronethat is I enter my balcony and see new prostrate subjects adoring and deifying me  Alex  Zounds what a vile custom it was to build houses with windows I'll have them all block'd up Skylights are the only things for a Christian countryWindows and balconies they are fit only for Turkish baths and public brothels  Seraph  Listen Deary and I'll bless ye with a secret Blind your windows and nail your doors but if your honour    curtseying    has no better security than these you'll be soon in the herd whose ideal ornaments    touching  his  forehead    are so terrific to you  Alex  The devil's in it if stone walls won't keep ye What stronger security could my honour have  Seraph  My  honour Rely on that and I swear to you by every thing sacred that no vestal's life shall be more blameless It is due to my own feelings to be chasteI don't condescend to think of yours in the affair The respect I bear myself makes me necessarily preserve my puritybut if I am suspected watch'd and haunted I know not but such torment may weary me out of principles which I have hitherto cherish'd as my life  Alex  If all this is true what the devil makes ye so fond of admiration  Seraph  I can't tell what devil makes me so fond of admiration but I know I love admiration and I will have it till he whom you represent says no  Alex  Whom I represent who's that  Seraph  Mercy who can it be but old shrivell'd greypated Time To  his  negative I shall yield but with a very ill will I assure you If the passion we have for admiration is wrong let nature look to it'twas she impress'd it on our hearts  and it is  her  law that to tyrannize over the peace of man is to woman consummation of happiness  Alex  And yet you every one of ye pretend to be tenderhearted and compassionate and all that  Seraph  Why to say truth one is a sort of a paradox At a tale of woe I melt like Niobe and am agoniz'd at distress if I cannot relieve it yet a lover's misery is delightful I would not abate a man who adored me a single sigh and should have no rest at night if I thought he was sleeping quietly  Alex  Lord have mercy    muttering to himself    Seraph  Now I hope you feel yourself very much honour'd that I take you so far into my confidenceIf you have a grain of sense you'll be charm'd with it  Alex  I don't know what the devil to make of ye Sometimes I think one thing

wellshe shall be married in less than a week    exit    Seraph  I shall give his daughter no such charge poor girl How can she receive Octavio well with her heart devoted to Sebastian I wonder  what sort of a thing this Signor issome wr  ed privy counsellor like himself I suppose  very odd now that those  antients  should take it into their venerable noddles that a youthful bride is a proper appendage to their dignity or to fancy that it requires no more talents to please a pretty wife than to govern a stupid nation Lord if my deary would but speak the truth now and warn his wise brethrenHeyday is  this  the Octavio Handsome I vow young bold  He  a privy counsellor Mercy how could I slander him so    Enter Octav    Welcome Don Octavio for I am inform'd that here you  must  have welcome The man I saw at church I protest  Octav  That cruel  must  checks the transport your welcome gave me May I not hope that  without  a must you would have given me welcome  Seraph  Oh yes pray hope it for as I think the season of  hoping  the most delightful in our lives I should be sorry to shorten yours  Octav  If you mean to shorten my hope by disappointment 'tis kind to protract it but there is a way of ending hope enchanting Viola without giving despair  Seraph  Viola did he call me  Octav  Oh permit me to believe that the honour your father allows me of telling you I adore you is not displeasing to you  Seraph  Mercy he takes me for my husband's daughterdelightful  Octav  From the moment I beheld you at vespers your image has never left me  Seraph  I vow I won't undeceive him I take it very ill of my image to follow a young man about and keep such bad company without my leave  Octav  Whilst your displeasure is thus playful I can support itOh how charming to find the information of your face did not deceive me  Seraph  Why what did it promise you  Octav  Elegance liveliness frankness and understanding  Seraph  Oh dear how our selflove operates on every occasion Had I receiv'd you with frowns and given you room to believe the commands of Don Alexis unpleasant to me you would have thought me intolerably stupid and wonder'd why nature gave intelligent eyes to an ideot  Octav  I will not defend myself to be the object of your raillery is an enviable distinction pray go on  Seraph  Nay then I have done An enemy who won't resist is not worth combating  Octav  If you will not combat an unresisting enemy I hope you will condescend to rank him with your slavesConsent to give me your chains  Seraph  Oh by all meansI like to increase my captives There    making as though she flung something over his neck    there are my chainsdo you feel them  Octav  Yes as rosy wreathsthey delight me  Seraph  That's not what I intend I would have you sigh under themaye in downright earnest too  Octav  It is impossible for me to sigh in earnest unless you tell me the hopes Don Alexis has given me make  you  sigh in earnest  Seraph  What were those hopes I pray  Octav  That I should have the transporting joy of calling you mine  Seraph  IndeedI can hardly think it  Octav  By all the tempting witch'ries of your face and the soft Cupids in your graceful air 'tis true  Seraph  So pretty an oath deserves a civil reply and I therefore protest to you the moment Don Alexis consents to my being yours I'll yield you my hand without reluctance But after this frank engagement Don Octavio I expect you to leave me for the presentI have a peculiar reason to request this favour Some one will come in a moment and spoil my roguery    aside    Octav  Your commands shall ever govern me but when may I again presume  Seraph  I cannot tell you exactly nowbe at the gate in the evening Adieuadieu    Running off    Octav  At the gate in the evening How sweetly that would sound if the little villain had not matrimony in her head Well if I must be a slave at some time in my life e'en let it be nowa desperate action should be done as soon as resolved on  Exit

imprisonment in a garret with the lives of the saints for my study and bread and water for my banquet  Sebas  Oh I would  embrace  the punishment if at the end of the period he would allow  you  to give me a new imprisonment  Carl  Now you might as well have put off those two speeches and a half to the next opportunity see the consequence here comes the old gentleman Well I'll not be in the mess

Sebastian  Henry  OH 'tis too much  Sebas  Too much ay so it is that they should be all so blind to your starts your angry blushes and your ill conceal'd confusion I drew you from the company the moment dinner ended lest when they had done eating they should begin to observe Do you reflect that Don Philip has only to betray you to the minister to get rid of his rival for ever  Henry  It is more than I can bearthe old dotard's fondness which I dare not yet oppose distracts me Oh that I could speak to her alone 'tis plain amidst all the bridal gaiety her heart is not at ease  Sebas  Your wish is half answered for here comes  her  halfthe worst half indeed by forty years  Henry  Half thou a lover and able to speak thus  to  a lover Speak of them as  one  Sebas  Forgive me for faith I am so much a lover at this moment that I scarcely know what I am saying In a word I am summon'd by my mistress's maid who has some new information in an hour I am again at your service  Exit  Enter Don Gasper  Don Gasp  Why how now Julio What stole awayrun from the guestshide in corners how's this  Henry  I am not in spirits for company Sir or to be sure this joyful occasion  Don Gasp  Not in spirits on your uncle's weddingdayout upon itBut tell me boy what do you think of the brideAm I not a happy man hey  Henry  If it turns out so Sir  Don Gasp  Oh I fear no turns She is virtuous and modest and you know a modest woman is above all pricebut perhaps you do  not  know that for the observation is made in a book not much read now a daysBut what d'ye think help'd me to get her  Henry  Ay Sir what didI long to be inform'd Wine perhaps will make him communicative    Aside    A splendid jointure probably  Don Gasp  Jointure she minds a jointure no more than a jointed dollguess again  Henry  I am not fortunate in guessing  Don Gasp  Then I'll tell yehalf a sheet of paper got her Ay you may well stare 'Twas but half a sheet of paperin which I procured it to be said that one Don Henry whom she lov'd was shrouded and buriedthat got her my boy    slapping him on the shoulder    there's a contriving uncle for you  Henry  Is it possible  Don Gasp  Possible why I  did  itI did it And where's the harm A banish'd man is a dead man  in the eye of the law and a dead man can be no husband He fought a duel and was forced to fly  Henry  And how Sir could you take advantage  Don Gasp  Why those young rascals take every advantage over us with nature to back 'em and we have a right to make reprisals when we can by the help of art  Henry  And so the lady believed your intelligence  Don Gasp  Yes yes she believ'dand swoon'd and ravedand took to her bed Faith the doctor gave her up but I still determined when it came to the last gasp to tell her the truth rather than have her death to answer forbut it never came to that  Henry  No no female grief tho' sometimes obstinate is seldom fatal Why my dear uncle you are a perfect Machiavel at a plot I shall try if I can't outplot you though    Aside    It will be amusing to see Antonia's astonishment when she finds her Henry is still livingha ha but then she'll be your's ha ha ha  Don Gasp  Yes then she'll be mineshe'll be mine ha ha ha You must know the chit had no fortune tho' of a noble familywas pester'd with youthful profligate lovers and at length to get rid of them agreed to give herself to me there's a stroke of prudence in a girl  Henry    Aside    Oh 'twas moreI feel it was a stroke of love to  me  But what will Don Henry say to this pretty jest which you and I find so laughable  Don Gasp  What care I what a man says a thousand miles off  Henry  But if he obtains his pardon he'll return and then  Don Gasp  Pardon Oh you don't know how deep I amI leave no loopholes for my schemes to drop through Hark in your earbut be secret I have bought his pardon  Henry  How Sirbought his pardon  Don Gasp  Hush that's all under the rose you understand meit cost me a good lump of moidores  Henry  You astonish meStrange kindness to a man whom you could rob of his wife  Don Gasp  Kindnesstut I got his pardon for myself that nobody else should have itso that if he gets any one to ask for it it will be answered "the pardon has been already granted" but for want of my appearance he's defunct depend on'tay as much out of the world as tho' the sexton had cover'd him with greensod  Henry  And are you actually in possession of his pardon  Don Gasp  As goodthe money is paid and I shall receive it from the broadseal office tomorrow  Henry  What a discovery is here    Aside    Don Alexis  enters

and his are black  Gasp  That's nothingthey've just the same look with 'em  Alex  Yes I grant ye as to the look his look as much like eyes as her's did Then she was round favour'd  Gasp  What signifies thata long face and a short face may have the same air  Alex  But his hair is dark and her's was light  Gasp  Oons how you talkWhy all hair must be light or dark or some colour Come along nephewWhen people get old they grow so obstinate there's no convincing them of any thing Come alongcome along    Exit with Don Henry    Alex  Don't take him to your Antonia lest she should have the odd notion that he's a fitter bridegroom for her than you are    Bawling after him    Well my dear boy I am come on purpose to ask how you manag'd today with my daughter The young slut is so mealymouth'd I could get nothing out of her Was she kinddid she shew a proper sense of the favour  Octav  Sense of the favour Sir She permitted  me  to implore the favour of being allow'd to hope

Alex  You'd have said yesyou would I know you would Boasted of the sweetness of her lip and of the pressure of her white hand but I I must know nothing I am an old father  Octav    aside    What can be the meaning of all this Is it his suspicion or his folly  Alex  Come why won't you tell me now Tell me at once  Octav  What shall I tell you Sir  Alex  What why that she treated ye kindly that you liked her pouting lips and that  Octav  Believe me Sir I dared not attempt such a liberty  Alex  No why had you not my permission  Octav  I did not so consider it Sir but if you'll lay your commands on the lady when I have the honour to wait on her again  Alex  Ay that I will never fear me But pray where's the foundation of your great content if nothing kind past I fear the slut has deceiv'd him    aside    Octav  Kind she was all angelic sweetness Sir  Alex  Pho don't tell me of  angelic  sweetness a young fellow should be content with nothing less than  mortal  sweetness when with a blooming girl  Octav  She had the condescension to promise  Alex  Whatwhat  Octav  That when you should order her to bestow her hand on me she would obey you without reluctance  Alex  She promis'd  that  did she  Octav  She did and my delighted soul hath dwelt on the sound from that moment  Alex  Well well come again this evening and your soul shall have something else besides sound to dwell upon or I'll understand why  Octav  Good Sir you would be very convenient I perceive but it unfortunately happens that I chuse the sweet trouble of getting over my love difficulties myself  Alex  Oh to be sureabove being oblig'd I see but I tell you these young baggages have all their arts to make a man half mad and I know 'emI'll manage her my little Octy never fear Sound indeed  Octav  Allow me Sir with all humility to request that you'll give yourself no trouble in the business S'death If I don't take care I shan't have the pleasure of running down my own game If you wish to make a soninlaw of me Sir you must permit me to travel the road of love in my own mannerNo bearing him  Exit  Alex  Zounds what a heat you're in Why so you may travel the road of love in your own mannerI only mean

breath    He reclines on a bank Some shrubs prevent his being immediately seen    Enter  Antonia  and  Clara  Cla  This is the strangest whim seeking shades and solitude instead of company and mirth What will Don Gasper say  Ant  Oh name him not the arrival of the young stranger his nephew has renewed all my miseries But here my sorrows have a short cessation Oh how those lonely shades will sooth my sadness Each day I'll seek the soft recess and opening all the treasures of remembrance live on my Henry's image  Clara  Come come that's a sort of image worship we don't allow It would be more catholic to live in lonely shades with himself "  This soft recess  " would be at least more  poetical  my dear with a handsome young man in it even tho' he should be uncivilly asleep    pointing to Henry    Ant    Not regarding her    Oh I'll call back each sacred hour which blest our wedded souls trace each fond scene that chasten'd love made pure and in the dear review forget that I'm a wretch

yetOh Clara I could wish his sleep lengthen'd to eternity and myself immortal to stand thus and gaze on him  Clara  One might almost fancy it Don Henry himself only unhappily 'tis not the custom for people to leave their family mansions in the churchyard to repose on violets for their mistresses to gaze on them  Ant  The resemblance is stronger now he sleeps When awake this stranger has a scorna severity in his eyesomething that made me fear but Henry's eye talk'd only love Oh I have seen a volume in a single glanceone look has said what eloquence and learning might try to imitate in vain    Sings    Sweet rosy sleep Oh do not fly  Bind thy soft fillet on his eye  That o'er each grace my own may rove  And feast my hapless joyless love  For when he lifts those shading lids  His chilling glance such bliss forbids  Then rosy sleep oh do not fly  But bind thy fillet on his eye  Clara  I say on the contrary open your eyes Who knows but they may by this time have acquired a softer

ficklenesspermit me to prove my constancy  Seraph  Impossibleimpossible  Octav  How so  Seraph  I see I must tell you to avoid altercation Be pleased to know then Sir that there is nothing on earth I detest like this sober quiet  prudent method of loving Your vows have a  father's  approbationyou are expectedyou enter the house without difficultyyou yawn through an hour of commonplacethe weddingday is fixed and we go to church to be married in the same humdrum stupid way that millions of dull couples have done before us No no this I can't submit to believe me  Octav  Ah 'tis plain we were born for each other we think so exactly alike    aside    These I confess are misfortunes but how in our case are they to be avoided  Seraph  If you are really in earnest in your love you must contrive to make Don Alexis hate you Let him throw a thousand difficulties in the way and then I'll throw  myself  into your arms  Octav  Oh that extatic promise But your father is unhappily attach'd to our marriageWhat the devil can I do to make him set his face against it I fear it is impossible  Seraph  Poor Don Octavio then you have no hopesfor I do swear by every thing that can bind me whilst Don Alexis approves of our nuptials I never will be your's  Octav  I'll bribe fellows to slander me was ever so unhappy a dilemma I thought his approbation till this moment a blessing but now I would willingly make him shut his doors against  me  and confine  you  to a grated room with a dozen smoakdried Duennas to guard you  Seraph  Ay then indeed things would go on gloriously You would be sighing and groaning without and I should be weeping and wailing within Then for plots and contrivancesthen for bribes and scaling laddersthen for escapes  and pursuitsOh what would I not do for a man who should bring me into such blissful difficulties  Octav  I swear you shall be obey'd whatever I hazard Who knows but an elopement may finish the affair short of marriage    Aside      A hustle withoutthe door opens a little and discovers Carlota struggling to keep out Alexis    Alexis  I tell you Mrs Brazen I will be amongst 'em  Carl  Bless me Sir how can you be so barbarous to disturb the young people  Seraph  There's Don Alexis now begin your task directlyprevent his coming in if he enters I never will be your's  Alexis  Let me in I say  Octav  Pardon me Sir you must not come in    Going to the door    Alexis  Must not come inwhy you young dog Well well tell me then is she kind hey my little Octy is she kind  Octav  Not quite so kind as I wish her to be  Alexis  Oh a jade You slut youyou perverse baggage I will have you kind to Octavio  Octav  Devil take him why does he not bid her dismiss me then she'd fly to my bosom    Aside    Alexis  Octy Octy    struggling with Carlota    have you kiss'd her yet  Octav  No    loudin passion    Alex  Then you shallI will see you kiss her by Jove  Carl  Lord Sir How can you be so rumbusterous  Alex  Come  in  I will  Seraph    aside    Then go  out  I must  Exit  Alex  So what's she off    bursting in    Octav  Off yes and now I'll be off What woman of delicacy could bear to be thus treated Or what father but you    going    Alex  Now dear Octy do not be angrydo not be angry You have the character of one of the civilest politest discreetest  Octav  The character lies SirI am none of these I am rude illnatured unjust fickle and full of extravagance  Alex  Hey day Why I believe you are full of wine too  Octav  I am every thing you ought to dread You could not in all Lisbon have picked out so hopeless a husband for your daughter  Alex  Oh Lord noyou are a very hopeful young gentlemanThe character you have given of yourself would suit ye all I doubtbut you seem so intimate with  your  faults that like a stale acquaintance they'll soon disgust yetherefore fickle drunk or mad my daughter shall be your wife  Octav  Are you so obstinate Sir  Alex  Ayand if she dares demur  Octav  Oh I am ruin'dif you persist I am ruin'd Dear Don Alexis pardon me I see my scheme was ridiculousa better strikes me In one wordstay let's take care we are not heard in one word you and I must both be in a plot against your lovelely capricious daughter  Alex  How now  Octav  Her vivacity renders a stupid formal  allow'd  courtship intolerable to her If you persist in countenancing my addresses she will hate me but if you order her to see me no more and allow me to steal her out of a window or  over the garden wall she'll be the happiest bride in Portugal  Alex  D'ye say so Oh a perverse baggage but I'll fit her Won't love ye merely because I order her to do it that she had from her mother  Octav  You must conceal your knowledge of that  Alex  Pho d'ye imagine I don't see your whole drift now If you was to continue talking a Lapland winter you could not make the hint clearer Gad she's coming and my wife with her So d'ye hear you Signor Don Octavio    speaking loud    you areI say you areyou shall know what you are another time for the present that's your way Sir that your way out and I'll be sworn you shall never know the way in    Pushing him out    Enter  Seraphina  and  Viola  Seraph  Why my dear husband is so mere a gudgeon there's no credit in deceiving him Now remember your lesson    to  Viola  Alex  So mistressI have dispatch'd your lover  Viola  Have you Sir  Alex  A young rakeshame your not liking him proves you have your father's penetration Notwithstanding his modest front there's not such a desperate fellow this side the Ganges no nor 'tother side the Black Sea  Seraph  My sweet love are you speaking of Don Octavio  Alex  Yes I am Take care you give him no encouragement d'ye hear girl No whisperings from your balcony no private correspondences  no billets dropt by your officious maid on pretence they are meant for some carottypated country cousin  Viola  Dear Sir  Alex  No pencil'd assignations on the back of your fan or cards in lemon juiceto be call'd on detection secret orders to your perfumer for pearl powder and bloom of Circassia  Seraph  How can you put such things in the girl's head deary  Alex    aside    That her fingers may put them in practice to be sure but you are not up to me there deary    aside    Viola  But a few minutes since you were fearful Sir that he was not received with sufficient favour  Alex  That wasthatwell no matter That was perhaps to try how far things had gone  Seraph  Oh I beg your pardon the curtain rises and we see the sun Now I understand your policyhow admirable You middleaged gentlemen are so deep that 'tis difficult to sift ye  Alex  Ay and when we are sifted  Seraph  You are found to be chaff Poor dear Don Octavio Send him a garland of willows Viola  Viola  Rather of myrtleshe's too handsome for willows  Alex  Handsome is he that handsome does remember that  Viola  Why Sir  he  does handsomely He has travell'd handsomely has a handsome estate has brought home a handsome character and now wishes for a handsome wife  Alex  Ay but he must go further a field to catch her though He'll find neither wives nor widgeons in my orchard  Seraph  No our widgeons are all within doors  Viola  Unfortunate that I am just made up my mind to dismiss Sebastian nay absolutely to dislike him and now  Alex  And now why now you must make up your mind t'other way Perhaps in my present humour of the two fools I like Sebastian best  Viola  But that humour must change for I can never think of those two young men as you do my dear father  Alex  Thoughts are free daughter Gad I could hug her    aside    Seraph  You see your father generously leaves your thoughts unshackled my dear he only desires to controul your actionspray oblige him and take Sebastian  Alex    aside    Zounds she knows nothing of our plot and gives that advice seriously  Seraph  He is a most accomplish'd young man  Alex  Wise  Seraph  Engaging in his manners and resistless in his form  Alex  My dear I say    spitefully    Seraph  His eyes are expressive and his tongue is eloquent  Alex  The devil's in  your  tongue    aside    You don't know what you are talking of  Seraph  I do indeedperfectly In short Viola he is so amiable so captivating and loves you with such unbounded fondness that if you marry any other your misery ought to equal your ingratitude  Alex  Gad she speaks with an air of too much convictionthis must be managed more nicely To your chamber hussey and try to forget Octavio    pushing off Viola    Seraph  And remember your Sebastian Let him be present to you waking and sleeping let him  Alex  Zounds let him alone    driving her off on the other side    you may be doing mischief all this while I dare not let her into my plot lest her perverseness or her folly should mar it And yet I thinkno hang it I won'tI won't The only plot that ever had a woman in it came to nothing I'll conduct this solely by my own sagacity and have a hearty laugh at the poor fools when all is over  Exit laughing  SCENE  An

break up    Exit Servant    There's no having any rest in this worldNo or at least not for the  husbands  of this worldThis custom of letting one's wives receive female company is like shutting your

jewels and let us haste away  Gasp  Hah are you thereabouts madam    between his teeth    then I'm cozen'd  Henry    aside    To attempt to force her off would be in vain  Ant  Will you not speak do

for Henry Oh thou perfidious wretch  Ant  Don Gasperwhat will become of me Whywhy are you so angry Sir at my naming one who in the cold grave cannot rival you I was only going to say that Henry would not have been so unkindly silent  Gasp  Was that all indeed my little Tony but 'twas wrong to think upon a young man Never let your thoughts run upon a young man whether in a grave or a garret  Ant  Never Sir be assured Neither in one place or the other will my thoughts ever seek a lover But why did you not speak  Gasp  Faith you prattled love so prettily I could have heard your little tongue run for ever But how came you out so late and with these jewels and parcels  Ant  SirI waswhy Sir  Rachel  Alas Sir we thought the city was in arms and pack'd up our things to secure 'em Lord Sir we were

hearts in one  Ant  Pardon me Sir Day is on the point of breakingdear welcome day and I am resolv'd to pass it unbound by any vows but those of love  Gasp  How  Ant  In this one point Sir I must govern or here I vow most solemnly never to be yours  Gasp  Oh its a rash vowa most unjustifiable vow  Rach  Not so rash a vow as that you want her to make  Gasp  What's that minx  Rach  Why Sir with submission I say its most rash and unjustifiable for eighteen to rise out of bed and go to church to vow to love sixtyfive and I'll maintain it  Gasp  But the vow was made hussey and all vows must be keptreligiously kept and therefore though it goes against me even this last shall be kept So come in my little Tony and learn of your nown Hubby never to break a vow    all go in    Henry  That secures me Her delicacy is safe from insult and when I see her next it shall be with powers to suppress his audacious fancied rights and close the necessity for these degrading acts for ever  Exit

my judges that I trust now to meet their pardon and invoke the gracious sign  FINIS  EPILOGUE  BY MR COBB  SPOKEN BY MISS FARREN  A Mourning Bridethat wou'd be something new  That I'm a Mourning Husband is too true  Cries old Sir Testy in his gouty chair  "Ah could I wedlock's fatal slip repair  "But young wives are a sort of flying gout  "Torments for which no cure was e'er found out  "Both old men's plagues to punish youthful tricks  "Equally difficult I fear to fix  "Of wife and gout alike I stand in dread  "For both alas sometimes affect the head"  Thus rail old cynics striving to disparage  The charming silken ties of modern marriage  In former times when folks agreed to wed  The silent bride by silent bridegroom led  Up to the altar march'd in solemn state  All was demure and stupidly sedate  Impress'd with awe while neither dar'd to speak  A wedding was a mere Ballet Tragique  Thank Heav'n we're past the ages of romance  Wedlock is now a kind of country dance  Where man and wife with smiles each other greet  Take hands change sides and part as soon as meet  Pleasure's soft accents ev'ry care dispel  While Hymen fiddles Vive la Bagatelle  Blest age when ceremony's chains are worn  Like bracelets not to setter but adorn  When we assume deep mourning's fable shew  'Tis etiquette prescribes the form of woe  Whate'er our loss we must have fashion's leave  Ere we can venture decently to grieve  Blameless the heir o'er the dear parchment chuckles  If he's unpowder'd and puts on black buckles  Till the grey frock speaks his first anguish o'er  And he's but half as wretched as before  Ere the gay widow first abroad is seen  Deck'd in exhilarating bombazeen  While the dear Col'nel visits unsuspected  And she's as well as could have been expected  Custom's indulgence wisely does she borrow  In cards of compliments exhausts her sorrow  Of tears her blackedg'd paper fills the place  Mourns as her proxy and preserves her face  Our Mourning Bride who with no sorrow labours  And mourns but in  appearance  like her neighbours  Tho' forc'd by etiquette good humour loves as well as any here  Blest in the fate which these kind smiles decree her  She hopes her friends will often come to see her  The following  NEW PIECES  written by Mrs  COWLEY  may be had of M  ssrs  ROBINSON  PaternosterRow  The RUNAWAY a Comedy Price s d  ALBINA a Tragedy s d  WHO's
