Parliament c  Worthy SIR  A  S the following Dissertations owe their birth to your judicious choice of the subject and liberal encouragement of it they now naturally wait upon you for your protection and countenance Your original design having been only to excite a noble emulation among the youth of an infant Seminary in a remote part of the world and to turn their early attention to a matter of very high and national importance you will not look for any thing in the execution beyond their years their experience or opportunities of information  YOUR known candor will likewise lead you to consider the peculiar difficulties arising from the times and circumstances in which these pieces were composed An act of the  British  parliament had become the  fatal cause of an unhappy breach of that UNION which had so long subsisted and ever ought to subsi  between the Colonies and the mother country and very general were the agitations and uneasiness thereby produced on this side of the  Atlantic  Even hoary age and men of the most subdued passions among us admi  ting the most plenary jurisdiction of a  British  Parliament could not in this par∣ticular case but consider their conduct as at least unkind to their  American  fellow subjects in desiring without any present necessity that appeared to us to come between us and our Sovereign and to lay a foundation which might easily have b  en drawn into a prece∣dent for depriving us of all future oppor∣tunities of testifying our loyalty by the free and voluntary grant of our own money  If then such was the light in which the  cool  and the  aged  considered this matter ex∣pressions of a warmer and more unguarded kind might have dropt from the pens of youth Yet no such thing appears in the following Dissertations which are laid before the public in the genuine form and dress wherein they were presented by their authors  Nor was it possible that the smallest additions or alterations could be made consistent with the plan pursued in the execution of your trust which plan you ought to have an account of and it may also be of use to preserve it here by way of precedent for future occasions of the like kind  SEVERAL considerations having prevented the Trustees of the College from proposing your MEDALS to be contended for by the youth the first year after the receipt of them they were at last proposed by an adver∣tisement as follows viz  College of  Philadelphia  March    WHEREAS John Sargent  Esq  mer∣chant in London and member of Par∣liament hath presented to this College a  Only so much of the advertisement is here inserted as relates to the disposition of the Medal which produced the following Essays Mr Sargent's other Medal not being yet disposed of  GOLD MEDAL for the best  English  essay  on the reciprocal advantages of a perpetual  UNION  between  GreatBritain  and her  Ame∣rican  Colonies  Notice is hereby given by order of the Trustees that the said  Medal  will be disposed of at the ensuing  commencement in  May  for the best essay that shall be produced on the subject pro∣posed by any of those who have received any degree or part of their education in this CollegeAnd as the said subject is one of the most important which can at this time employ the pen of the  patriot  or  scholar  and is thus left open to all those who have had any connection with this College either as students or graduates it is hoped for the honour of the Seminary as well as their own they will nobly exert themselves on a subject so truly animating which may be treated in a manner alike interesting to good men both here and in the mother country  Each candidate is desired to prefix a motto and a mark or device to his per∣formance and seal it up without his name in a separate cover He is then to put his name under another s  aled cover writing on the outside of this cover the same motto and mark or device which he has prefixed to his performance  THE utmost impartiality will be ob∣served by the Trustees and Professors in  examining the several performances with∣out opening any of the covers that contain the names till it is first determined which of the performances is entitled to the Medal and then only that cover will be opened on which the motto is written that directs to the name of the person entitled to the prize which shall be given in pub∣lic at the ensuing commencement and therefore the several candidates are desired to send their compositions and names sealed and covered as aforesaid to the Provost on or before the th day of  May    ON the th day of  May  accordingly nine different performances were produced on a careful perusal of which the three im∣mediately following were laid aside for a se∣cond reading after which the Medal was unan  mously decreed to the first The second also was judged a masterly judicious and sensible performance worthy of a Medal also if there had been another for the same subject and the third was likewise greatly approved of as a spirited performance so far as it went and it was agreed that the pub∣lication of both together with the prizepiece  would be of service at this crisis which determination was immediately inserted in the public papers in pursuance whereof the modest and ingenious youth who is author of the second Dissertation gave leave to pub∣lish it with his name The author of the third Dissertation wrote concerning his piece that he  had but two days to spare from a particular hurry of business in his profession to prepare it in and that so far from thinking it disgraced by being the third best he would have rejoiced for the honor of the Seminary in which he received his first education if all the other six had been superior also and that if there were any observations in it which had not oc∣curred to the other gentlemen or were likely to serve as hints for abler pens to set so important a subject in a proper light he readily consented to its publication but requested for particular reasons that his name might not be annexed to it  THE fourth little piece is the production of an ingenious son of the college in his own easy unpremeditated way He has by many compositions done honor to the place of his  education and by this which was only the sudden work of a few hours of that day in which the other pieces were under exami∣nation he meant not to come in compe∣tition for the prize but only to throw his mite into the general stock After his de∣parture to  England  some of his friends having desired it to be published with the three first pieces it was accordingly annexed and had any of the authors of the other five remaining pieces or their friends made the like request they would have been indulged in it Indeed most of them would have well deserved to be laid before the pub∣lic had we not been afraid that the repetition of many of the same sentiments which must unavoidably run through them all on the same subject would at length become tire∣some to the reader  WE have only now to mention the oc∣casion of the following Eulogium By your own proposal as well as by order of the Trustees of the College the Medal was to be conferred at a public commencement Wherefore at the commencement  May  th immediately after the valedic∣tory  oration the Hon JOHN PENN  Esq  Governor of the province as President of the Trustees of the College delivered the  Medal  to the Provost ordering him to confer it in public agreeable to their previous deter∣mination The Provost accordingly acquaint∣ed the audience that the same had been decreed to JOHN MORGAN MD FRS c and professor of the theory and practice of physic in the College of  Philadelphia  and then requested Dr  Morgan  to deliver his Dissertation in public which being finished the EULOGIUM accompanied the conferring of the Medal  AN EULOGIUM On the delivery of Mr SARGENT's PrizeMedal at the public Commencement in the College of Philadelphia May  By WILLIAM SMITH D D Pro∣vost of that College  Published by desire  SIR  AS the reward of your great merit in this elegant performance I am in the name of the Trustees and Faculty of this College as well as in behalf of the worthy Donor to beg your acceptance of this GOLD MEDALIts intrinsic value may not be an object of much consideration to you but the truly honourable circum∣stances by which it now becomes yours must render it one of the most valuable jewels in your possession  ADORNED tho' you have been with honors in distant lands yet we trust those will not be the least acceptable to you which your native country bestows  THAT the first literary prize contended for in this Institution should fall to the share of one of its eldest sons who to much genius and application has joined much knowledge of the world will not seem strange Yet still for the honor of the Seminary and what will not derogate from your honor it will appear that you have obtained this preeminence over no mean competitors  SOME of our younger sons among whom we ought not to omit the name of the modest and candid  Author of the second of the following Dissertations  WATTS with some others even of inferior standing have exhibited such vi∣gorous efforts of genius and tread so ar∣dently on the heels of you and others their seniors that it will require the utmost ex∣ertion of all your faculties the continual straining of every nerve if you would long wish to lead the way to them in the great career of Fame  O NOBLE contest O happy seat of Science to behold such a divine emulation among thy sons kindled by the ardent desire of glory and supported on those liberal principles which true Literature alone can inspire  MUCH do we owe to you Gentlemen on this occasion much every way much for the pains you have taken to do honor to the p  ace of your education and much for the public testimony you have given in its favor declaring that  here  you have imbibed the true principles of Liberty and have learned from your  early  See Dr Morgan's Dissertation who was one of the first graduates  youth that your head your heart and your hand should ever be at the service of your country    TRUE it is Gentlemen that we have pub∣lickly inculcatedand it was our duty to inculcate on you  that  These quotations are from a charge delivered by the author of this Eulogium to the first class of gra∣duates in the College of Philadelphia May th Dr Morgan was one of this class  if there be any thing on this earth suited to the native dig∣nity of the human mind and worthy of con∣tention  it must be to assert the cause of Religion and Truth to support the fun∣damental rights and liberties of mankind and to strive for the constitution of your country and a government by known laws freely consented to by yourselves or your certain delegates  WE have exhorted you  when your country calls to be all eye and ear and heart and voice and hand in a cause so glorious proceeding with a manly and intrepid spirit with a fervent and en∣lightened zeal fearless of danger un∣daunted by opposition and convincing the world that Liberty is your unconquer∣able delight and that you are sworn foes to every species of bondage either of body or of mind  BUT however much it might have been our duty to deliver lessons of this kind small would have been the honour we should have derived from them if you Gentlemen had not nobly called those lessons forth into Action demonstrating by your  living  example that the education you received in this place  was not a mere art of furnishing the Head but a true discipline of the Life and Manners  TRULY delicate and difficult we confess was the subject prescribed to youto treat of  the reciprocal advantages of a perpetual UNION between  GreatBritain  and her  American  Colonies  at a time when a fatal Misunderstanding had untwisted all the cords of that UNION and the minds of many were too much inflamed This difficulty was likewise encreased to us by other con∣siderations  GreatBritain  who by her liberality had raised this College from a helpless to a flou∣rishing state had an undoubted demand on us in our particular capacity for all the re∣turns of gratitude Yet we could not we durst not divert the streams of Learning from their sacred course Our country nay all  America  had a right to demand that those streams should be directed pure along to water the goodly TREE OF LIBERTY nor ever be suffered to cherish any foul weed that would choak its growth  IN this most difficult conjuncture we re∣joice to behold you in your early youth exercising all the temper and prudence of the most experienced Patriots freely and duti∣fully acknowledging in behalf of the mother country that  See Dissertation third  as the design of colonizing was not to found a  new  empire but to ex∣tend the  old  the Colonies owe obedience under all constitutional and legal restric∣tions and a due subordination in all com∣mercial purposes  yet firmly asserting in behalf of the Colonies that they  are entitled in return to the full and free enjoyment of BRITISH LIBERTY and ne∣cessary protection from all external violence and that a policy which would ensure a small immediate revenue at the expence of a great though indirect national gain is  mean  and  sordid  unworthy of the gene∣rous enterprizing spirit of a commercial nation  and radically destructive of the mutual confidence  WE rejoice that ever we had the least share in forming sentiments like these which have led you to draw the true line and power∣fully  to shew that on the everlasting basis of  reciprocal Interest  and a participation of  con∣stitutional priv  leges  and on this alone our UNION shall be perpetuated and  our  See Mr WATTS's Dissertation  bleeding wounds healed up without so much as a scar by way of remembrance  HERE you have shewn yourselves entitled to the name of true SONS OF LIBERTY SONS OF LIBERTY INDEED neither betray∣ing her sacred cause on the one hand nor de∣generating into  Licentiousness  on the other  THE occasion now calls me to address a few things to you Gentlemen who have just received your degrees in this Seminary but I would not trespass on the patience of this candid audience  YOU have observed the honors to which li∣terary merit and integrity of principles have already advanced those who have gone be∣fore you in their studies here and you can∣not but be sensible that of all the glories reflected on this Institution we judge those the most solid and transporting which we derive from our own sons  THE time is fast approaching and I trust your bosoms now glow for it when you too shall in your turn have an opportunity of doing honour to your education by your conduct in public life When that time shall come educated as you have been in the prin∣ciples of sound Liberty permit us to pro∣mise ourselves that you will ever think it your glory to be enlisted under her banners and to follow her exalted call  WHAT we have often given in solemn charge to those who have gone before you and what you have often heard delivered in the course of your studies here is I hope engraven on your memories and need not now be re∣peated  YOU will consider all arts all sciences all eloquence all philosophy as intended to dis∣cipline the soul for eternity and so far as they center not ultimately in this grand view they are at best but empty trifles Always look on the scriptures of God as that master system of knowledge by which all other wisdom is to be regulated and perfected  IN whatever station of life you are we hope you never will forget your obligations to this seminary which will travail as it were in pain for you till you appear on the the∣atre of action with dignity and will expect to find its own children and sons at least among the number of its friends We wish you every felicity and bid you farewell  AND here I ought to concludeBut the joyous occasion calls me to return particular thanks to this splendid audience for the coun∣tenance they have given us this day and to congra  ulate them on the glorious and happy turn in the affairs of  America  whereof yester∣day  The account of the repeal of the  American  stamp∣act was received at  Philadelphia  the day before the de∣livery of this Elogium viz May  gave us the certain and confirmed accounts  WHEN I look back on the dreadful state of suspence in which these Colonies have been so long agitated when in the room of foreboding doubt and painful sollicitude I behold joy in every look the clouds dispers∣ed the sun breaking in upon us again and  an assembly around me in which every man rejoices to salute his neighbour as Free I  Feel  I  Feel  a sympathy unutter∣able and an exultation of soul never felt before  O GLORIOUS day O happy  America  if now we but know how to prize our happiness The unguarded sallies of intemperate zeal will soon be forgotten but the stedfast the noble the patriotic efforts of cool and good men in the vindication of native and consti∣tutional rights will more and more claim the regard of all the Free in every clime and age and perhaps be consecrated by time into one of the brightest transactions of our story asserting our pedigree and shewing that we were worthy of having been descended from the illustrious stock of  Britons  THE cause of Liberty Civil and Religious is the cause of  Britain  herselfnay it is the cause of heaven and it was with inexpressible satisfaction that I beheld more than one of the gentlemen who have written on the ties of UNION between  GreatBritain  and her co∣lonies deriving a very capital argument from the ties of a Common Religion  WHEN I review the history of the world and look on the progress of Knowledge Free∣dom Arts and Sciences I cannot but be strongly persuaded that Heaven has yet glo∣rious purposes to serve thro'  America  CIVIL Liberty the Protestant Religion the principles of Toleration in their purity ho∣norable as they are to human nature subsist but in few places of the globe and  GreatBritain  is their principal residence  UNDER her auspices they were transplanted into  America  where they have got firm root and are flourishing into immense growth and will bring such an accession of strength to the general cause of Liberty and Pro∣testantism that we trust no power on earth shall ever be able to prevail against their united strength  THIS sentiment it is hoped will more and more gain ground among good men both here and in the mother country convincing them that to check the spirit of Freedom or discourage the propagation of knowledge here in  America  would on the part of  GreatBritain  be to wound her own members and weaken or destroy that glorious public system of Truth Freedom and Happiness whereof she is the Guardian and the head  ANIMATED by these principles and guided by an enlightened zeal it will become us to manifest our gratitude and love to the mo∣ther country by every means in our power Let us make our moderation known to all the world bending our whole thoughts to a virtuous industry beneficial to ourselves and to  GreatBritain  acting  as Free but not using our liberty as a cloak of malicious∣ness  or of Licentioussness  DISSERTATION ON THE Reciprocal ADVANTAGES OF A Perpetual UNION Between  GREATBRITAIN  And her  AMERICAN  COLONIES FOR WHICH Mr SARGENT'S PRIZEMEDAL WAS ADJUDGED TO  JOHN MORGAN  M D F R S c and Professor of the Theory and Practice of Physic in the College of Philadelphia  TO  JOHN SARGENT  Esq  MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT c THIS ESSAY AS A SMALL TESTIMONY OF GRATITUDE FOR MANY PERSONAL FAVOURS RECEIVED AND FROM A DUE SENSE OF HIS ACCURATE JUDGMENT AND PUBLIC SPIRIT MANIFESTED AS WELL IN THE CHOICE OF THE SUBJECT FOR THE FOLLOWING PERFORMANCE AS IN THE POLITE AND GENEROUS MANNER IN WHICH HE PROPOSED IT IS MOST HUMBLY INSCRIBED BY HIS MUCH OBLIGED MOST OBEDIENT AND VERY HUMBLE SERVANT  JOHN MORGAN  DISSERTATION I On the reciprocal ADVANTAGES OF A PERPETUAL UNION BETWEEN  GREATBRITAIN  AND Her  AMERICAN  COLONIES  N  EVER hath the cause of Liberty employed the pen of any of her votaries upon a subject of greater importance to  Britain  and her Co∣lonies  Introduction  than the  reciprocal advantages  of which a perpetual UNION between them must necessarily be productive To investigate these advantages and to place them in a clear and conspicuous point of view requires much skill and ingenuity and affords ample scope for a vigorous exertion of the brightest genius assisted and improved by the most extensive literature A competent knowledge of the great and fundamental principles of govern∣ment  of the nature of the  British  constitution the particular rights and privileges of the several Colonies together with the history of their produce trade and commerce is indis∣pensably necessary to such an undertaking  UNEQUAL as I am to the arduous task  Motives for this undertak∣ing  and trembling lest the subject should suffer under my unpractised hand I have been almost tempted to decline it but when I consider myself at once as a  Briton  and an  American  and reflect upon the invaluable privileges and benefits to which in both these characters and capacities I am so happy as to be en∣tituled every apprehension vanishes an ho∣nest confidence takes place and I venture to deliver my sentiments rude and unpolished as they are upon this interesting theme depending for success upon that love of li∣berty and that warm zeal for my country's welfare with which my bosom does and I trust will always glow 'Tis this alone gives me reason to hope for that candour from my dear countrymen to which I am well con∣vinced my poor abilities can lay no claim  BUT I have an additional incentive to this undertaking for I am called to it  Further mo∣tive  as the son  of an Institution wherein I imbibed the true principles of Liberty and was taught to ad∣mire the beauty and excellency of that civil constitution in which the governing powers mutually controul and are controuled by each other in which the rights of prince and people are accurately discriminated and li∣berty and property effectually secured by a government of laws not of men in which civil and religious rights and privileges are held sacred and inviolable and declared to be no less the birthright of the meanest subject in the most distant and obscure corner of the realm than of the highest courtier that basks in the sunshine of royal favour  THIS  British American  seminary which was founded upon these principles and is careful to transmit them pure and uncorrupted to all her children is justly intituled to a greater tribute from me than I have it in my power to pay She has often inculcated this lesson upon my youth "That my head my hand and my heart should be at the service of my country" My head and my hand perhaps may fail of rendering her such assistances as she receives from better heads and abler  hands but the present occasion will at least enable me to shew that I have an heart as deeply interested in my country's welfare as any of her sons 'Tis upon this principle alone that I stand a candidate for the honours which are now proposed "to the best dis∣sertation on the reciprocal advantages of a perpetual Union between  GreatBritain  and her colonies"  IN treating of this important subject  The plan of treating the subject  was I to enter upon a full and compleat enumera∣tion of all these advantages I should doubtless exceed the limits usually prescribed to per∣formances of this nature The principal arguments that I shall advance in favour of this perpetual union shall be derived from one or other of these two sources  First  From a consideration of the nature and extent of the Commerce that subsists between  GreatBritain  and her Colonies and the amazing increase of riches and power which they reciprocally derive from that Com∣merce  Secondly  From the glorious prospect of the advancement of the Protestant Religion  which they profess and spreading the Gospel in its purity through the vast benighted re∣gions of this western world  BUT a full discussion of the several argu∣ments to be drawn even from these two sources would require a volume instead of a short dissertation I shall therefore confine myself chiesly to those which may be drawn from the first source and only touch upon the second in the close of the performance  IN the first place then  A general view of the present state of the colonies  if we do but take a general view of the present flourishing con∣dition of the Colonies and reflect upon the very small beginnings from which they have rose in so short a time to such a height as now renders them the richest jewel in the crown of  Britain  if we consider the figure that  NewEngland NewYork  the  Jerseys Pennsylvania Maryland Virginia  and  Caro∣lina  make at this day compared with the state of these countries in the hands of their original proprietors if we attend a little to the amazing increase of their inhabitants their products and exports the prodigious quantities of manufactures they take off  from  England  and the ballance of trade which she obtains from their commodities the shipping this commerce requires the sea∣men it raises the mouths it feeds the hands it employs and the accumulated wealth which it brings to thousands nay millions of sub∣jects we cannot but be fully convinced of the vast importance and advantage of a per∣petual Union between  GreatBritain  and her  American  colonies  CAN the warmest imagination form to itself an idea of aught more sublime and delightful  Their great improvement  than those happy effects which commerce and the full enjoyment of civil and religious liberty have so suddenly produced in coun∣tries which were not long since the dreary haunts of savage beasts and savage men Where ignorance and barbarity frowned over the uncultivated earth gay fields now smile bedecked in the yellow robe of fulleared har∣vest cities rise majestic to the view fleets too croud the capacious harbour with their swell∣ing canvas and swarms of chearful inhabitants cover the shore with monuments of their industry through a long tract of two thou∣sand miles  FROM this general view of the amazing  ncrease of our  American  Colonies  A detail of the subject  I naturally proceed to a particular detail of the advan∣tages which are derived from them to the mother country  CERTAIN it is  Advantages of planting colo∣nies  that nothing can contribute more to the flourishing state of any trading nation than the establishing of settlements in foreign parts Experience evinces the truth of this Their  American  plantations hereto∣fore rendered the  Portuguese  and  Spaniards  rich and powerful and these are now not only the greatest and constant but almost the only source of their wealth Nor have either the  French  or  Dutch  been inattentive to this im∣portant object Witness the settlements of the latter in the  EastIndies  which by their application to commerce under the blessings of a moderate government in a few score years  from the low and distressed states of  Hol∣land  rendered them high and mighty  Witness the efforts which  France  made the last war for the conquest of  America  a prize worthy to be contended for by the most powerful nations The city of  Tyre  "whose mer∣chants were as princes and her great men  the honourable of the earth" was like  GreatBritain  situated upon an island and like  GreatBritain  maintained the dominion of the sea by her commerce The principal seat of her trade and great source of her wealth was the noble colony of  Carthage  which she founded the power and naval strength of which was carried to such a height by means of commerce that forty years were spent by the  Romans  before they were able to subdue this mighty people  Preceptor Vol On Trade and Commerce  To a nation situated on an island  Particularly to  GreatBritain  as  GreatBritain  is accommodated with every conve∣niency for trade the establishing of foreign plantations to promote her commerce is par∣ticularly beneficial since the inhabitants have no other way of conveying abroad their pro∣duct and manufactures but by navigation which breeds seamen and brings in wealth to maintain them This renders  England  con∣siderable by her fleets respected by her allies and the scourge of her enemies Such hands therefore as are employed for those useful purposes deserve all kind of encouragement for on the pillars of her commerce depend the safety and strength of  England  ONE of the most considerable advantages therefore  One of the most considerable  which  GreatBritain  derives from her  American  colonies arises from their sup∣plying her with commodities of her own whereby a vast treasure is saved to the nation which would otherwise be spent in foreign Kingdoms  IN  NorthAmerica  Natural ad∣vantages of  America  we have almost every kind of climate as well as soil to the extent of seven hundred leagues or upwards on the seacoast from  North  to  South  These lands are capable of the greatest improvement by cultivation They yield some of the most valuable commodities for trade and such as are in the highest demand in other countries such as cotton silk indigo rice and great quantities of all kinds of corn of the best quality and the number of commodities might be easily augmented Vines are natural to many parts of the country a variety of medicinal drugs gums and plants is not wanting flax for linen and hemp for cordage are brought here to very great per∣fection the woods yield materials for ships houses and cabinet work the pine trees will furnish a plenty of masts and yards with pitch turpentine tar and rosin The woods  also abound in game furs and all sorts of peltry are furnished from hence In the bowels of the earth there are mines of iron copper and coal in great abundance there are various sorts of useful earths for bricks and tiles and a variety of useful stones for building Lastly  NorthAmerica  has spaci∣ous and safe harbours for shipping and navi∣gable rivers variously intersect the country to facilitate the communication from one part to the other  Now if the planting of colonies is so bene∣ficial to a commercial people  Its convenien∣cies for settling of colonies  if these are more especially advantageous to an island surrounded with ports and where every inle may prove a convenient harbour and if a country abounding with useful commodities blessed with a fertile soil and a variety of healthy climates is particularly calculated for the planting growth and increase of colonies we may readily conclude that the settlement of the  British American  colonies must hav  proved of the utmost advantage to  GreatBritain  Nor is such a conclusion void  foundation as we shall be fully convinced b  comparing the present condition of  England  with what it was whilst yet she had no plantations  BEFORE that period  Condition of  England  before she had any co∣lonies  it is computed that the people of  London  did not exceed one sixth part of their present number  England  was then obliged to pay to foreigners for all the commodities she now gets from  America  at a most exorbitant price and now exports those very goods to the very same nations from which she was wont to get them It is in∣geniously observed by an able pen that rum sugar and tobacco if we had no plantations would prove so many issues to drain us of our circulating cash which are now the sources of private wealth and the public revenue  AT the time when queen  Elizabeth  entered upon her government  In queen  Eli∣zabeth  's reign  the customs produced but thirtysix thousand pounds a year a sum far less than what one of her colonies now brings into the treasury The legal interest of money was then at  per cent  It is now but and  England  abounds in riches Her shipping too is increased to the most astonish∣ing degree In the year queen  Eliza∣beth  's time the whole royal navy consisted but  twentyfour ships and all the shipping then in  England  both great and small fell short of eight hundred fail a number not equal to half the vessels which are employed at this time to carry on the commerce of  America  According to an abstract made about thirty years ago  See the Preceptor on Trade and Commerce Vol  the royal navy consisted of three hundred and twentytwo sail carrying twelve thousand two hundred and seventy pieces of cannon and since that time has been conti∣nually increasing If the whole royal navy had been in commission at the end of the last war and manned to its full compliment it could not have amounted to much less than one hundred thousand seamen  ALTHOUGH the manufactures of  England  are  The colonies are useful in taking off the manufactures of  GreatBri∣tain  within a very few years prodigiously augmented the plantations alone take off near one half By their consumption of  English  ma∣nufactures great are the advantages which re∣dound to  GreatBritain  from her empire in  America  The plantation trade is by far the most valuable of any whereof  England  can boast the enjoyment What we may place great stress upon it is continually improving  It is a mine in which we still find richer and nobler veins Whilst other springs of com∣merce are drying up this overflows It is permanent whilst others are shifting place What crowns its value it is our own in which other nations cannot rival  England  nor can they deprive her of it  GREAT as the present product of our trade is  The  American  trade may be rendered still more beneficial  it might be made much more beneficial as it is computed by intelligent writers that above a million annually might be saved or added to the stock by a proper encourage∣ment of many articles that might be raised in  America  By the purchase of them abroad we contribute to enrich other nations who extort very exorbitant sums from us and who have it in their power to disappoint us of them perhaps when they become most ne∣cessary to us  SEEING then  It is impolitic to import  Ame∣rican  commo∣dities from o∣ther nations  from the preceeding account of the colonies  England  may be supplied from thence with some of the most valuable commodities such as raw silk from  Georgia  for her own manufactures hemp for cordage iron for various arts a great abundance of naval stores of all kinds from  Pennsylvania  Carolina NewJersey NewYork  and  NewEngland  as planks timber masts yards and all materials for shipbuilding it is a reflec∣tion on our politics to expend our money with other nations for these articles For hemp indeed exported from the plantations a bounty has lately been allowed by par∣liament from which  England  will unques∣tionably derive great benefit to herself The same encouragement will produce the same good effect in regard to iron and pot∣ashes A bourty allowed on these articles though inconsiderable must soon be reim∣bursed manifold by saving vast sums of money yearly remitted to foreigners for these commodities  THE bounty allowed upon pitch  Pitch tar and turpentine  tar and turpentine has brought the price of these commodities in  England  to ten shillings ster∣ling a barrel which used to amount to fifty shillings for which too was paid ready money This regulation therefore prevents five time the sum of its cost from going out of the king¦dom to  Sweden  and other northern power  and aids the colonies to make returns for the immense quantity of goods sent to them fro  England  The above articles now come so cheap to the shipbuilders of  GreatBritain  that the charge is hardly felt by them and the bounty that is paid by the nation on the importation of those commodities is doubly repaid by lessening the proportion between the importation and exportation that was against us in these articles which is called the ballance of trade  Introduction to the  British  Empire in  America  "It is agreed by all who pretend to understand trade  Ballance of trade what  says judge  Littleton  that a country does then grow rich and then only when the commodities exported out of it are of more value than those that are imported into it"  Judge  Littleton  's Treatise on the Groans of the Plan∣tations  It is but wisdom therefore in  Britain  to encourage the raising of every commodity in  America  of which she stands in need herself or which may increase the ballance of trade in her favour  AND here we may properly take notice of the considerable advantages derived from an interchange of manufactures and commodi∣ties between  GreatBritain  and  America  Benefits of an interchange of manufactures and commodi∣ties  The labour that is necessary in manufactures the  expenfive carriage and different hands they pass through must greatly heighten their value Whilst commodities generally employ but one set of people manufactures employ many They afford a subsistance to the poor collect people into villages extend the buildings of towns and cities improve the soil enhance the property of landlords and create a considerable intercourse between artificers and merchants  Value of the manufactures from the hands they pass thro'  The consumers of  English  woolen manufactures in  America  are obliged to pay about  per cent  advance on the first cost by way of profit to the different hands which these manufactures pass thro' before they arrive to them viz To the wool∣stapler the clothier the woolen draper the merchants in  England  and  America  for freight and insurance and to the retailer This calculation is made by an ingenious and in∣telligent merchant of  Philadelphia  well versed in this subject Whence it appears that manufactures are not more valuable in themselves than from the number of persons they support  HENCE it follows likewise  The export of  American  com∣modities re∣cōmmended  that while  GreatBritain  is employed in manufactures  America  ought to be encouraged in raising all sorts of commodities and exporting them to  Britain  By which means the mother country will be supplied with materials for carrying on her manufactures and the Colo∣nies be enabled to purchase those manufactures of which they stand in need and thus they will become reciprocally necessary to each other  IT is judged  The trrade of  America  with  England  that the whole trade of  Ame∣rica  to all parts of the globe employs one year with another above two thousand sail of  English  ships by which treasures of greater wealth are conveyed to  Britain  than are de∣rived from  Mexico  or  Peru  The amount of the cash and bills of exchange and of the commodities sent to  England  in payment for her goods and of the duties on these com∣modities cannot be less than two millions yearly From the commodities of  America  chiefly manufactured in  England  and con∣veyed through innumerable channels of trade to every quarter of the globe  GreatBritain  acquires immense wealth keeps up a spirit of industry among her inhabitants and is en∣abled to support mighty fleets great in peace and formidable in war  BUT further  The  American  Colonies ad∣vantageous to  Britain  in time of war  the  American  Colonies are not only very beneficial to the trade of  Britain  in time of peace but are highly advantageous to her in case of war with  France  or  Spain  the most common and natural enemies of  Britain  The very situation of the  British  islands in  America  renders it easy to annoy those of the  French  or  Spaniards  The continental Colo∣nies too on an emergency are able to furnish many thousand brave men who when joined by any body of regular forces from  England  and convoyed by a  British  squadron would ef∣fectually shake the  French  and  Spanish  domi∣nions both in  North  and  SouthAmerica  This has been done and may be done again when any future provocation calls them to unite their force with that of  Britain  against their common enemy Thus it appears I think with the highest degree of evidence that  Britain  owes much of her wellbeing her riches and her power to her  American  colo∣nies 'Tis from her union with them she draws the sinews of war whereby she is enabled to conquer and prescribe terms of peace to her enemies and to fix her glory upon a sure and lasting basis  BUT if from what has been said  It is the inte∣rest of the  American  Co∣lonies to per∣petuate their union with  GreatBritain  it appears to be the interest of  Britain  to perpetuate her union with her Colonies in  America  it will appear no less manifest by the sequel that it is the interest of those Colonies to perpe∣tuate their union with  Britain  THE  American  Colonies  Proved from the support commerce of  England  by the support and commerce of  Britain  have emerged as it were out of darkness into light and in less than two centuries have become a numerous and happy people Between two and three millions at least of subjects by transplan∣tation from  Europe  and by natural increase now inhabit these colonies For this in∣crease of numbers wealth and power they are indebted originally to  Britain  from whence they derived their mild government their equal laws and secure property Must they not then naturally desire a perpetual union with their mother country whilst they taste the sweets of  British  liberty and enjoy the advantages of her trade and commerce  AND this leads me to mention another rea∣son why the Colonies should wish to perpe∣tuate their union with  Britain  The demand for  British  ma∣nufactures  viz  the considerable benefit which they derive from the  British  manufactures The price of labour  in  America  is too great to allow the inhabi∣tants to manufacture for themselves They supply all their wants from  Britain  and are enabled to make good remittances by their commodities which might otherwise lie use∣less on their hands  AGAIN  And the ad∣vantageous al∣liance  Ame∣rica  Greatbritain  were the  American  colonies to be considered as having no union or connection with  Britain  what power could secure them from her conquering arm whenever she was disposed to stretch it forth But while the Union is perpetuated between them and the colonies are considered as a part of the  British  empire  Britain  surely by her formidable fleets and brave and disciplined armies could afford them speedy succour in the day of danger and effectually secure them from the hostile attempts of any power in  Europe  I ask once more then must not the colonies naturally desire a perpetual union with their mother country since it is from her they enjoy the sweets of  British  liberty the ad∣vantages of  British  commerce and the pro∣tection of  British  power  I HAVE said the less of the importance of  GreatBritain  to the  American  Colonies  An erroneous principle con∣sidered  be∣cause  this is a subject upon which every writer seems to be agreed whereas there have been some narrow shortsighted poli∣ticians who have attempted to diminish the importance of the colonies to  GreatBritain  'Tis for this reason that I have entered upon a more minute detail of the latter and have moreover subjoined to the end of this disser∣tation an Appendix containing a summary view of the  American  commerce the produce and exports of the several colonies whereby the national stock is so considerably aug∣mented  THUS have I endeavoured to point out the reciprocal advantages of a perpetual union between  GreatBritain  and her Colonies  Conclusions to be drawn from this view of commerce  from a particular view of the nature and extent of the commerce that subsists between them and the vast accessions of wealth and power which they reciprocally derive from that commerce I have shewn how necessary they are to one another and that they must suffer and decline in proportion as the present union betwixt them is weakened or destroyed I have only to add further under this head a few observations upon the most probable methods of preserving and perpetuating this union  WITH respect to  GreatBritain  The surest means of pre∣serving this union consi∣dered on the part of  GreatBritain  I think the surest method she can take to preserve this union inviolate is to consider the inte∣rests of  America  as her own to encourage the willing obedience of a dutiful and loyal peo∣ple by equal laws and a free and open commerce rather than attempt by unequal laws and too severe restrictions to force an unwilling subjection The ballance of trade will return more clear money from the  Ame∣rican  Colonies than can be extorted from them either by armies taxes or tribute "It is more safe as well as virtuous to accept the chaste embraces of conjugal affection than by violence to extort forbidden pleasures which commonly fail the expectations"  Cato  's letters  IT is an illjudged policy  Impolitic re∣strictions of trade  therefore which would prevent the Colonies from enriching themselves by trade at the expence of their neighbours For these are only the channels through which the riches of foreign nations are poured into the coffers of  Britain  And if these channels are once dried up the watchful enemies and rivals of  Britain  would soon avail themselves of our errors Com∣merce once forced from her wonted course is  seldom or never brought into it again Fo∣reigners would soon usurp our trade and thrive in proportion as we decline  To secure the liberty and property of all its subjects is or ought to be  What is or ought to be the end of go∣vernment and common standard of action  the end of every government So long as this end is kept in view so long are the people united by the firmest bond of society the interest of the whole This end must be the common standard by which the particular actions of the several members towards each other ought to be regulated Particular ranks of men have particular feelings peculiar to themselves and often contrary to the inte∣rests and feelings of the rest of the society and therefore have no right to make and much less to impose laws on their fellowsubjects inconsistent with and opposite to those interests and those seelings therefore a society government or real public must consist of freemen chusing or consenting to laws themselves "To watch over such a system and to promote its good as much as lies in our power to resist every encroach∣ment on it and to defend it to the utmost is the political duty of every citizen"  See Preceptor Vol on Ethics  But  to sacrifice the interests of one part to those of another part weakens the affection of sub∣jects inasmuch as the preservation of our rights the security of our persons liberties and property on the one hand and obedience to government on the other hand are the re∣ciprocal duties of the rulers and ruled  IF the superstructure of a government be raised on any other foundation than the ge∣neral interest of the whole community  viz The gene∣ral interest of the whole com∣munity  it can not be durable Like the image of  Daniel  's vision the head whereof was of fine gold the belly and thighs of brass the legs of iron and the feet part of iron and part of clay which cannot cleave together it must when smote upon be broken to pieces But the constitution of a country in which the hap∣piness of the whole community is regarded is like a firm oak that withstands the fury of the jarring elements roused up into a storm fixes its roots deeper in its native earth and lifts its majestic head to the skies Whilst this principle is kept up in its full vigour it will endure the shocks of contending nations and be still more firmly established It will yield to nought but time before which the "Sun himself shall fail and nature sink in years"  WHEN the public is safe and trade encou∣raged  Which is the happiness and support of a country  every man participates of the common felicity and has means of acquiring property The riches of a good King consist in the wealth of his subjects The affections of his people are his security and happiness All they possess their fortune and property are at his disposal because they are employed to secure both him and themselves A wise government ought therefore to secure the possession of property and raise no taxes but what they shall see a real necessity for doing and continue them no longer than that ne∣cessity requires It should be done in a man∣ner most agreeable to the sentiments of the people who best know what they can en∣dure for a virtuous and public spirit a spirit of Liberty is the chief if not the only support of a country  See  Cato  's letters on the subject of Liberty  SHOULD any ignorant or selfish politicians in the mother country ever have influence enough to get such laws enacted  An opposite conduct in what respect pernicious  as would bear hard upon the liberty or property of the Colonies this measure would doubtless have a natural tendency to sow the seeds of dis∣content  among them and to alienate their affections Instead of considering  Britain  then as connected with them by the natural ties of a mother country they would begin to look upon her as a foreign power treating them as her tributaries and attempting to enslave them For the same noble spirit of freedom which actuates an  Englishman  born in the island of  Britain  beats in every pulse and pants in every breast of the  British  sub∣jects in  America  Add to this the Colonies were settled upon a presumption that the same extensive privileges which were origi∣nally granted to them should not in after∣times be contracted or withdrawn When  GreatBritain  has attained to such a pitch of grandeur by the industry and success of her Colonies as hath rendered her the admiration and envy of her neighbours would it be con∣sistent with the maxims of justice for her to resume the privileges she has granted under which they have so amazingly flourished and which they have never forfeited No the rights of  Americans  are established on the same foundation with those of  Britain  herself She cannot violate them without at the same time undermining her own constitution and  the same sword that is sheathed in the bowels of  America  must inevitably pierce the vitals of  Britain  too Far other returns however may be hoped for by a people whose com∣merce has proved so beneficial to  Britain  who have at the expence of so much treasure and so much blood assisted her in gaining a compleat ascendency over their common ene∣my They are a people too who contributed much by their bravery in a former war to procure an honourable and unlooked for peace to their mother country when she was of herself in no condition to prescribe her own terms  The island of  CapeBreton  which was esteemed the  Dunkirk  of  America  was taken by the troops of  NewEngland  with little or no assistance from home and this was all the  English  had to restore to  France  at the treaty of  Aix la Chapelle  for the restitution of  Bergen op∣zoom  to her allies and for other terms of peace  THUS it appears  A violation of the  American  rights impoli∣tic  that the most effectual method which  GreatBritain  can take to per∣petuate her union with the Colonies is to continue them in the full exercise of those liberties and privileges both with respect to commerce and taxes which they have hither∣to enjoyed and to do nothing that can justly  be looked upon as a violation of their rights which might end in a breach of this desirable union  WITH respect to the Colonies  The method by which the Colonies may preserve the present union  the surest method they can take to preserve inviolate their union with  Britain  is upon every oc∣casion to demonstrate their loyalty to the best of Kings and their subordination to the go∣vernment of  Great Britain  by exerting their united efforts in the support and defence of the dignity of the  British  crown and the rights of the  British  parliament and by chearfully and constantly submitting to the just determination of the grand council of the realm A conduct opposite to this would make them forfeit the rights of sons and justly bring upon them the indignation and chastisement of the mother country  THESE are the methods  The effects of such a conduct  which to me ap∣pear most likely to perpetuate the glorious union between  GreatBritain  and her Colo∣nies which will ensure strength and success to the common cause and baffle every at∣tempt of their enemies to injure or molest them Thus will the commerce riches and power of  Britain  be carried to an envied  pitch of greatness and as far surpass what they now are as they do at this day exceed what they were before  GreatBritain  could boast of a colony  I HAVE enlarged so much upon the advan∣tages of a perpetual union between  GreatBritain  and her Colonies  Benefits of this union to Reli∣gion and the Protestant in∣terest  collected from a view of the nature and extent of the com∣merce that subsists between them and the immense accession of riches and power which they reciprocally enjoy from that commerce that I can now say but little of the glorious prospect which this union presents to us in the promotion of the Protestant Religion which they profess and extending the Gospel in its purity throughout the vast benighted regions of the western world  THIS consideration is indeed as far superior to that which I have hitherto dwelt upon  Superior to that of mere commerce c  as things eternal are to those of a mere temporal nature One relates to the greatest of this world's good even liberty and property The other extends to a future and eternal world and is employed upon such objects as are most likely to secure the happy enjoyment of it 'Tis the glory of  Britain  that she en∣joys both these advantages in the highest de∣gree  that the means of preserving the for∣mer is secured to her by the best  civil  consti∣tution and the means of obtaining the latter by the best  religious  establishment in the world  WITH the sons of  Britain  the Protestant religion was transplanted into the Colonies  By the spread∣ing of the Gos∣pel  It has taken root grown and flourished in the kindly soil It has already become a fair and lofty tree and if it is still well nurtured and sufficiently watered it may e'er long extend its boughs beyond the setting sun even to the verge of the eastern world and perhaps shel∣ter the native country from whence it origi∣nally sprung Thus  Britain  has already been an happy instrument in the hands of Heaven of bearing the tidings of the Gospel to one of the darkest corners of the globe to nations who had long sat in darkness and the shadow of death By perpetuating an union with her Colonies she may likewise through them carry these glad tidings further still even to the utmost ends of the earth and thus hasten if I may so speak that glorious period when "righteousness shall overflow the earth as the waters cover the seas" And when all the kingdoms of the world shall become the kingdoms of the Lord and of his Christ  IF such then are to be the happy conse∣quences of this glorious union  Conclusion  should not every  American  every  British  Protestant ar∣dently wish and pray that it may be faithfully and inviolably preserved and continued "as long as the Sun and Moon endure"  APPENDIX  Containing a general view of the trade of the  American  Colonies their produce exports  c  chiefly extracted from approved histories and authentic memoirs  IN this Appendix to observe some order I shall begin with an account of the  British  settlements to the  Northward  and first with  Newfoundland  This great island which is above three hundred miles long and two hundred broad forms the  Eastern  boundary of the Gulf of St  Lawrence  and extends from thence  Southward  near ten degrees of latitude along the  Eastward  part of  NovaScotia  It is chiefly valuable for the great Fishery upon those shoals  Newfoundland  its Fishery  which are called the Banks of  Newfoundland  The plenty of Cod and several other species of Fish here is almost inconceivable as well as along the shores of the island of  CapeBreton  the coasts  NovaScotia  and  NewEngland  which pours in  a treasure of riches on  GreatBritain  Our share of the  Newfoundland  fishery was former∣ly computed to increase the national stock at least three hundred thousand pounds sterling a year in gold and silver remitted for the Cod we sell in the different parts of  Europe  in  Spain Portugal Italy  and the  Levant  c  See Account of  European  settlements in  America  by  Dodsley  of how much more wealth must it be pro∣ductive at present to the mother country as  Newfoundland  and  NovaScotia  belong now so entirely to  GreatBritain  The advantages which attend an extensive and wellmanaged fishery are great and obvious The sea may be considered as a mine out of which the trea∣sure is taken at a very little expence and even that expence is advantageous since it promotes several manufactures and goes en∣tirely amongst our own people Fish is a valuable commodity both at home and a∣broad According to some writers the  Dutch  make more of their fishery in our seas than the  Spaniards  do by the  WestIndies  Besides this fishery properly attended to would infalliably furnish us with a constant supply of experienced active and healthy  sailors for manning our fleets the gradual increase of which would prove not only a con∣stant and inexhaustible source of wealth and add to the ballance of trade in our favour but augment our maritime force to a degree that would make us a match for all  Europe  in naval power  Preceptor  ADJACENT to  Newfoundland  is the country of  NovaScotia  which  NovaScotia  although the progress of it was at first but slow is now become a considerable settlement and is a very ad∣vantageous place for fishing Twentyfive thousand quintals of fish have been caught there in one year  British  Empire in  America  BUT much more considerable is the colony of  NewEngland  NewEngland  This colony is in length near three hundred miles and in some part near two hundred miles in breadth lying between the fortyfirst and fortyfifth de∣grees of  North  latitude and comprizes the four provinces of  MassachusettsBay Connec∣ticut RhodeIsland  and  NewHampshire  THERE is a noble Codfishery on this coast  Its Fishery  which employs a vast number of their people  and proves a very considerable article of trade They are enabled by this to export annually above thirty thousand quintals of choice Cod∣fish to  Spain Italy  and the  Mediterranean  and near twenty thousand quintals of the refuse sort to the  WestIndies  as food for the  Negroes  besides a large quantity to  Madeira  and  Fyal  for wines and brandy  THE business of shipbuilding is one of the most considerable which  Boston  Its Tiade  or the other seaport towns in  NewEngland  carry on This country has materials enough to build ships for half the employment of  Britain  It can furnish the trade and navy too with naval stores for the supplies of which from the  Baltic  two or three hundred thousand pounds sterling annually was wont to be expended In their trade to foreign parts the profits of their voyage are generally received in bills of exchange upon  London  or in returns of goods through the hands of  English  factors By this circuitous commerce they pay in  GreatBritain  for various sorts of goods got from thence to the amount of some hundred thou∣sand pounds sterling a year Although their commerce is not carried on immediately with  GreatBritain  nor with  British  vessels yet here the profits chiefly center where all the money which the Colonies can make in any manner must center at last Potashes a most necessary article in manufactures particularly in bleaching as many thousand barrels are annually consumed for this one purpose in  Ireland  have within these few years proved a very advantageous article of trade in several of the Colonies particularly in  NewEngland  and is likely to become a very valuable and growing remittance to the mother country The amount of the potashes exported home from  NewEngland  only within the last twelve months is said to be not less than thirty thou∣sand pounds sterling and it is imagined that the quantity this year will arise to a much more considerable sum The spirit of gain which the making of potashes has already inspired it is probable will every year conti∣nue to render this manufacture an object of much greater importance to  America  than has been generally imagined Near six hundred sail of ships have been laden in a year for  Europe  and the  British  plantations From Christmas to Christmas five hundred vessels cleared out from the port of  Boston  only for  a foreign trade and four hundred and thirty were entered inwards Great is the advan∣tage therefore of the  NewEngland  trade and navigation if only considered as a nursery of seamen how much more by considering the addition it makes to the national stock  History of the  British  Empire in  America  THE three contigious provinces  NewYork NewJersey  and  Pennsylva∣nia  their trade  viz NewYork NewJersey  and  Pennsylvania  to the  Southward  of  NewEngland  are with very little difference the same in their climate productions and the commodities in which they trade the soil being in general very fertile abounding not only in its native grain the  Indian  corn but few parts of the world exceed these provinces in the abundance and excellence of their Wheat Barley Rye Oats Buckwheat c  GREAT quantities of Flax and Hemp are raised in these provinces Mines of iron have been opened in them all and a rich mine of copper has been successfully worked in  EastJersey  which may prove highly advantageous to the manufactures of  GreatBritain  The trade of these provinces to the  WestIndies  is very  considerable in Provisions Hides Tallow Lumber and Soap c for which they can procure Sugars and from this find some re∣source of making remittance to  England  for the goods they get from thence They car∣ry on a trade also with  Spain Portugal Italy Madeira  and  Fyal  they trade likewise to  England  and  Ireland  in Hemp Flaxseed Linseed Oil Furs and Deerskins Flaxseed is a very promising article of Commerce as  Ireland  must be dependant on the  American  Colonies for an annual supply In times of scarcity prodigious quantities of wheat are shipped to  England  and  Ireland  as well as to other parts of  Europe  Thus the  Americans  send home to their fellowsubjects of  GreatBritain  both goods to increase the national stock and also bread for their subsistence  Amongst the several acts which passed the House of Commons and gained his Majesty's royal assent the last sessions of Parliament is an Act for allowing the importation of Wheat from  America  duty free for a limited time  The importations from  England  into the pro∣vince of  Pennsylvania  only it is estimated hath in several years amounted to more than half a million sterling  per annum  Memorial of the Merchants and Traders of the city of  Philadelphia  THERE cannot be less than seven or eight hundred sail of ships annually employed to keep up the extensive trade of these provinces  Maryland  and  Virginia  Trade of  Ma∣ryland  and  Vir∣ginia  which are to the  Southward  of  Pennsylvania  agree very much in their soil and product  TOBACCO is the standing commodity of both these colonies A late sensible writer computes that there are shipped from these places annually hogsheads of Tobacco at an average of weight each of these are expended in home consumption the duty of each is twentyseven pounds ster∣ling and the amount of the whole duty on them is above eight hundred thousand pounds and of the remaining hogsheads after the imports and part of the subsidy are drawn back about onefifth of the sum is produced into the Exchequer from every hogshead that is reexported which is above three hundred thousand pounds more The whole amount for the customs of Tobacco is more than a million Such is the immense advantage  which the Mother Country derives from the article of Tobacco alone which she gets from her Colonies  See Considerations on the propriety of imposing taxes on the  British  Colonies for raising a revenue by Act of Parliament and also a Computation by Sir  Thomas Dally  in the History of the  British  Empire in  America  North  and  SouthCarolina  North  and  SouthCarolina  to the  Southward  of  Virginia  lye between the thirtyfirst and thirtysixth degrees of  North  latitude in a very fine climate  THE trade of  Carolina  has three great staple commodities Rice Indigo and Naval Stores which it yields more abundantly than all the rest of our Colonies Rice antiently formed by itself the staple of  Carolina  The export of this commodity from  Charlestown  in the year amounted only to barrels In a few years afterwards the product of it was computed to return to  GreatBritan  at least £  per annum  including freight and commissions which are the most profi∣table articles in the  British  commerce In the year the export of Rice from  Charles∣town  amounted to barrels In the year this branch of commerce was  computed to be annually worth at the lowest estimation £ sterling Great has been its increase since and we may well reckon it to be at this time worth £ sterling  IT was long before  Carolina  went into the profitable trade of Indigo they began it since the year and in the year was exported from  Charlestown  to the amount of above lb weight and lb weight was made in the year If the in∣habitants continue to improve the advantages with the same spirit in which they have begun they must naturally and necessarily come to supply the whole consumption of the world with this commodity and consequently make their country the richest part of the  British  dominions  See Account of  European  Settlements printed by  Dodsley  To the  Southward  of  Carolina  on the bor∣ders of  Florida  Georgia  was erected the province of  Georgia  in  Georgia  is of importance at present and will be of future benefit to  England  by raising raw Silk the goodness of its Silk has been tried by a proper engine and according to  Sir  Thomas Lombe  is better than the finest Silk of  Piedmont  for which half a million a year has been paid Potashes too has been imported from hence to  England  besides Peltry Drugs and Dyers ware of several sorts  WE come next to the  Spanish  settlement of St  Augustine  to the  Southward  of  Georgia  St Augustine  It belongs now to the  English  as well as  Ca∣nada  and  Louisiana  by the last treaty of peace so that they claim the whole of  NorthAmerica  upon the  Atlantic  sea  WE shall say nothing of the newly formed Colonies in  Florida  as being but yet in their infancy or of the settlements in  Hudson  's  Bay  as not very considerable hitherto but how great must be the advantage of trade with the  Indians  in  Canada  and  Louisiana  now ceded to the  English  which encouraged and enabled the  French  to hem in all the  English  Colonies by a chain of forts on their back settlements extended in a tract of above miles  See Account of the  British  Settlements in  America  and History of the  British  empire in  America  Canada  borders to the  Northward  upon the provinces of  NovaScotia NewEngland  and  NewYork  It is the oldest of all the  French  establishments and prior to the settlement of  NewEngland Quebec  is the capital of this pro∣vince It is built on the river St  Lawrence  upon which are the principal settlements of this Colony A vast trade already is and a much greater may in time be carried on with the  Indians  on the prodigious fresh water Lakes of which there are five in number in extent to be considered as so many seas They communicate with one another and the last of them with the river St  Lawrence  which effectually commands the trade of the Lakes and has an influence upon all the nations of  Indians  which confine upon them  THE principal produce of the  WestIndies  is Sugar  Of the  WestIndies  It is amazing what riches have been acquired to  England  by this commodity and what a surprizingly great number of ships are employed in the trade especially of  Bar∣bados  and  Jamaica  This last place is of great consequence to annoy

UNION BETWEEN  GREATBRITAIN  AND Her  AMERICAN  Colonies  By  STEPHEN WATTS  M A  ADVERTISEMENT to the Reader  THE author is very sensible that it would have been proper in composing the following Essay to have consulted with gentlemen who reside in the several places he had occasion to speak of and are well acquainted with the na∣ture and extent of their commerce Would the time allowed for these performances have af∣fored him an opportunity of procuring such information he flatters himself his piece would have been more  original  with respect to matters of trade and more worthy of public notice He would have been thereby enabled to form a more exact estimate of the  present  state of trade in  GreatBritain  and  America  Depriv'd of this advantage he was obliged to have recourse to commercial writers amongst whom he is chiefly indebted to  Gee  and  Beawes  And when it is considered that few persons though of far greater abilities and experience in the commercial world than the author would be able of their own know∣ledge to furnish an adequate account of every material branch in the  British  and  American  trade he cannot despair of the Reader's in∣dulgence  DISSERTATION II  T  HE situation of  GreatBritain  separated from the rest of the world by the surrounding ocean and destitute of those endless re∣sources which an extent of continent affords its inhabitants very early suggested to ju∣dicious and observing men that a naval force would be the easiest and most sure means of her defence against foreign encroachments The great  Alfred  of glorious and immortal memory was fully convinced of this impor∣tant truth He knew by sad experience that the want of such a force had subjected the island to the insults and depredations of the  Danes  and other  Northern  robbers Ani∣mated with affection for his subjects and fir'd with a just resentment of the injuries they had received he resolved if possible to supply such a fatal defect By equipping with in∣credible expedition a fleet considerable in  those days he rendered himself master of the sea and freed his people from the dread of being plundered But in a few years this beneficial this glorious project unsupported by a sufficient fund was almost entirely laid aside The inhabitants employed in the ex∣ercise of arms or agriculture and raising what was barely necessary for their own subsistence could not possibly defray the expence of having a fleet always in readiness The  Danes  taking advantage of their remissness in this important affair soon overrun and sub∣dued the greatest part of the island but in∣attentive to a lesson which their own success might have taught them they in their turn fell a prey to an innundation of  Normans  THUS the  British  navy though several at∣tempts were made to render it respectable by monarchs who understood their own interests continued nevertheless to make no great figure till the reign of queen  Elizabeth  Till this time also the trade of  England  was very small and contracted within a narrow com∣pass It consisted chiefly in exporting Tin Lead Wool and a few other articles which served to purchase what foreign goods were  wanted That wise queen assisted by a wise and experienced ministry discovered the grand secret unknown to her predecessors they knew the advantages of a fleet but the consequent expences they knew not how to defray An extensive commerce was now very judiciously considered as the only source adequate to such large and continual disbursements This it was thought would not only afford a sup∣ply of money sufficient to equip and main∣tain a powerful navy but would also be a school or nursery of seamen  ON these considerations encouragement was given to the persecuted  Walloons  to re∣move and settle in  England  They very wil∣lingly embraced an opportunity of transport∣ing themselves to a land of freedom and brought with them the Woollen manufactory which favoured with the countenance and protection of a wise government soon arrived at great perfection In pursuance of the same plan a trade was opened to  Turkey Muscovy  the  EastIndies  and almost every considerable country in the known world Under the auspices of the same queen plan∣tations were begun in  AMERICA  and prose∣cuted  with vigour They at first met with nearly insuperable difficulties nevertheless by the indefatigable industry and perseverance of the planters and the generous assistance of their mother Country those difficulties were sur∣mounted and the Colonies brought to a pitch of greatness that considering the short time of their growth is almost incredible  I HAVE taken this retrospect in order to shew that the  British  Trade the  British  Navy and the  British  Colonies in  America  sprung up together They are most nearly allied being children of the same good policy and it is worthy the notice and attention of every politician who studies to promote his coun∣try's welfare that as they had their rise at the same time they have ever since continued to increase and flourish in proportion Their de∣pendence is mutual and if either of them be affected the others sooner or later will feel it in a very sensible manner  GREAT has been my surprize at the ig∣norance or malevolence of several late pro∣ductions The writers of them either blinded by passion or employed and instigated by the  enemies of the  British  empire have endea∣voured to sow discord and dissention between the Mother Country and her  American  Colo∣nies Some have strove to render the colo∣nists suspected by representing them as an ungrateful licentious people aiming at in∣dependence and impatient of any subordi∣nation to  GreatBritain  whilst others no less enemies to the welfare and prosperity of both would excite  their  jealousy by under∣valuing the assistance  she  has offerded them and placing her in the light of a cruel Step∣mother  I am too well convinced of the good sense of my countrymen both of  Britain  and  America  to imagine them capable of being deluded by such partial representations Considering themselves as members of one grand body politic they will naturally con∣clude that the good of the whole must result from a due connection and harmony of all the parts and from the mutual exchange and intercourse of friendly offices Nevertheless as this point seems to have been controverted a few observations tending to evince that a "perpetual  UNION  between  GreatBritain  and her  American  Colonies will be mutually and  reciprocally  advantageous" may not be less agreeable than necessary in the present Dis∣sertation  THIS is a subject the most truly important and interesting which can claim a  Briton  's notice and does honour to that worthy gen∣tleman who propos'd its discussion by the Sons of this Seminary Struck with its vast delicacy and importance and conscious of in∣ability to treat it in a manner suited to its dignity I had almost declin'd the arduous task but it is a glory even to fail in great at∣tempts and if I should afford a hint to some abler pen or contribute to remove the smallest prejudice I shall think myself ex∣tremely happy in being so far beneficial to the public  WE have already observed that the de∣fence the strength and glory of  Britain  principally depend on her Navy and that her Navy can only be maintained by Trade and Commerce These are points too plain to be denied or disputed by the most obstinate and perverse sceptic and it is a very natural in∣ference from these premises that whatever contributes to enlarge and extend her com∣merce is highly advantageous to  GreatBritain  IT must likewise be acknowledged that new settlements and young countries stand in need of the assistance and protection of some powerful commercial state Destitute of these they would be exposed to the attacks of lawless invaders for want of strength to defend themselves and to the inclemency of weather for want of proper cloathing for manufactures cannot be brought to any de∣gree of perfection or extended to advantage except in wellsettled countries although agriculture where the land is tolerably fer∣tile and the settlement secure may enable the inhabitants to procure the necessary manufactures in return for its productions  I HOPE therefore to make it appear that a reciprocal emolument will arise from a per∣petual union between  Britain  and her  Ame∣rican  Colonies as she may by their means greatly enlarge her trade and commerce and become still more rich and powerful and as they will reap the advantage of her riches and power by being protected from their ene∣mies and supplied with the conveniencies of life at a cheaper rate and of a better quality than if manufactured by themselves  IF we take a survey of the commerce of  Britain  we shall find it extended to almost every part of the known world there is scarcely any place considerable for trade that is not visited by her adventurous merchants The means which have enabled her to ac∣quire and support with dignity and advantage such large mercantile connections are to be sought for in her various manufactories amongst which the Woollen is universally al∣lowed the preference Commercial writers have taken much pains to enumerate the par∣ticular kinds of  British  manufactures to shew their mutual dependence and wherein the peculiar advantage of each consists As their works are in every one's hands it is the less necessary for me to repeat their substance and to particularize the articles which con∣tribute to support the trade of  Britain  BUT there are two branches of commerce whcih though not so generally attended to are nevertheless most highly beneficial The Fisheries of  Newfoundland CapeBreton  and St  John  's and thereexportation of foreign goods have greatly increased the  British  navigation  riches and power It is supposed that sail of vessels are employed in those fisheries the number of hands necessary to navigate them to cure and dry the fish must be very large and great the consumption of pro∣visions nets and other utensils brought almost entirely from  England  GOODS for reexportation are received from different quarters some from  Germany Flan∣ders  c but in the greatest quantities from the  EastIndies  and  America  The bullion sent to the former is made an objection to that trade the force of which it is not my province to determine Nothing of this sort can however be objected to the trade to the  American  plantations which is of all most ad∣vantageous to the nation There is scarcely any one species of  English  manufactures that is not vended in  America  those of  India  likewise come here to a ready market In short it is from  GreatBritain  that the Colo∣nies import almost every thing requisite for cloathing agriculture and other uses In return for these they send her Sugar To∣bacco Rice Furs Potash Naval Stores  Gold and Silver and the ballance of a consi∣derable trade with  Portugal Spain  and other countries bordering on the  Mediterranean  in Bills of Exchange  HERE is an occasion to expatiate on the be∣nefits deriv'd to  Britain  from each of these particulars to observe the prodigious prices she paid for them to foreigners before their production in  British America  and the com∣comparatively small prices for which they are procured at present The large quantities reexported to foreign markets and pro∣ducing a demand upon them for very great sums annually might also be mentioned with much propriety Nor would it be amiss to shew the immense addition these articles bring to the revenue But all these topics have been so largely insisted on in late pamphlets and detached pieces and must be so well known to every one that further mention of them is unnecessary Only I would beg leave to observe a particular still unnoticed in the year the government of  Sweden  refused a supply of Pitch and Tar unless for ready money at their own price and in  Swedish  bottoms Such a gross imposition awaken'd the indignation and resentment of  Britain  and taught the true policy of deriving them from the Colonies Encouragement was thereupon given and soon produced a suffi∣cient quantity to answer all her demands But the spirit of the nation was again lull'd the  Sweeds  resumed their trade and that of  Ame∣rica  was very much neglected  SOME perhaps will readily grant that the exportation of these articles from  America  is beneficial to her and serves to enrich her inhabitants but in what respect can it be esteemed advantageous to  Britain  THIS question admits a very obvious solu∣tion It is advantageous to  Britain  in various respects It affords freight for many thou∣sand ton of her shipping and a nursery of seamen for the royal navy the commissions enrich her merchants and the reexportation brings abundance of wealth into the kingdom The duties they pay are an immense increase of the revenue and they are received from the plantations in return for  British  produc∣tions and manufactures of which the Colonies  take off more than any foreign market what∣ever The importation of  British  goods and those received by the way of  Britain  has on a medium for several years past amounted to upwards of two millions annually a sum so immense that although the Colonies abound with valuable articles extremely well adapted to the  British  market and very beneficial to her trade and navigation and though they make large remittances by the way of  Spain Portugal  and  Italy  in bills of exchange yet the produce of all these sources leaves a large ballance in favour of  Britain  which they pay her in gold and silver This in part furnishes bullion for the  EastIndia  trade on account of which and the vast consumption of  India  goods the flourishing condition of that valu∣able branch of commerce may in no small degree very justly be attributed to the  American  Colonies  THUS we see that not only every species of the manufactures of  Britain  but also her fo∣reign trade and navigation are much indebted to  America  Hence riches have flowed into her coffers and enabled her to support a fleet  sufficient to maintain the empire of the ocean And whoever considers the state of the Co∣lonies must conclude that they have not been losers by their intercourse with their mother country Consideration being had of the short time the  American  settlements have been made the inhabitants have increased in riches and number to admiration though far from en∣joying that affluence of which some would represent them possessed The advantages of their trade have been mutual  She  by their means has continued to rise in wealth and power whilst  they  in the sunshine of her as∣sistance and protection and the enjoyment of a beneficial commerce have grown up and flourished and still continue to flourish the equal advantage ornament and glory of  Britain  BUT should we only take a retrospect should we confine ourselves barely to what is past much injustice would be done to this animating subject and we should lose a pros∣pect which cannot but afford the highest pleasure to every  Briton  Let us therefore look forward to the mutual benefits which with proper attention may hereafter arise  IN order to this it will be necessary briefly to enumerate those articles of  GreatBritain  's foreign importations which have relation to the present subject They are raw thrown and wrought Silk Velvets Linens Timber Boards Potash and all kinds of Naval Stores Several writers on trade have computed the ballances paid by  Britain  for those sorts of goods to  France Italy Germany Flanders Norway Denmark Sweeden  and  Russia  and none I have met with make the amount less than two millions annually this she discharges in gold and silver Perhaps matter of fact may be opposed to this estimate because there is not so great an exportation of bullion but the argument is not hereby invalidated If the ballance on some other trade which would else be brought home and added to the national stock be diverted and sent to those places it is equally pernicious to the kingdom as if it was imported and then ex∣ported And this is certainly the case  Bri∣tain  on her particular trade with  Holland  for instance has a right to a very large ballance in specie but the latter by keeping in her Debt the nations abovementioned or several  them who have demands on  Britain  is en∣abled by their means to satisfy her  British  creditors and save her money and besides this bullion is sent to  Holland  to answer bills of exchange drawn in favour of those nations  THE consideration of this must deeply af∣fect every one who has at heart the trade and prosperity of  GreatBritain  and would preserve her independent of her  European  neighbours especially as the wollen manu∣factory is in its decline  France  not only supplies her own people with woollens but by the cheapness of her goods and the counte∣nance of the court of  Spain  has in a great measure supplanted  England  in the  Spanish  markets The  Spaniards  themselves sensible of their impolitic conduct seem determined to persist no longer in an error the result of illgrounded principles and mistaken notions of honour They have made several efforts to establish manufactories of their own Wool which have by no means proved fruitless Other nations of  Europe  observing the suc∣cess of  France  have copied her example by  which  England  has lost much of her woollen trade particularly with  Portugal  where the importation of this staple commodity seems to meet with many discouragements  FROM this reflection our attention is natu∣rally turned to  America  which will be her surest and perhaps in time her only market as restored fabrication is likely to take place in every part of  Europe  If under these cir∣cumstances such large sums are continually paid for foreign imports the ballance of trade in favour of  Britain  will be materially di∣minished The only remedy for this grow∣ing evil is to be found in  America  who can furnish a variety of the most useful raw ma∣terials on terms mutually beneficial  GREAT quantities of Furs and Peltry have been and still are sent from the Colonies to  Britain  the acquisition of  Canada  having thrown that whole trade into our hands but it is capable of greater improvement and may well supersede the fur trade to Russia The  Northern Indians  with a little encou∣ragement will bring their Ermines and other fine furs from the th degree of latitude  which is parallel with the  European  countries where the most valuable Furs are procured The distance those people will travel to trade with our settlements is well known to all acquainted with their affairs This would likewise be a means of dispersing  British  manufactures amongst a multitude of  Indian  tribes at present unknown to our traders  IRON mines are so plenty in almost every province on the continent that it is thought with good reason they could supply all the markets in  Europe  As for Timber Boards Pitch and Tar they may likewise be procured here in great abundance  British America  extended along the coast more than miles and reaching an unknown but prodigious way into the continent is almost one continued forest fill'd with every kind of useful timber not∣withstanding the great devastions made within the two last centuries  HERE it may possibly be objected that the expensive freight of these bulky articles would render them unfit for the  English  markets The  Danes Swedes  and others  employed at present in the Lumber trade are no doubt by long experience become skillfull and can afford their goods at the cheapest rates but the Colonies might be put upon a par with them by encouragement from the legislature Greater difficulties in other in∣stances have yielded to the efforts of  British  adventurers  America  may vie with any coun∣try whatever in plenty of materials and other conveniences and if large bulky ships were built of seven or eight hundred tons capable of being navigated by fewer hands in pro∣portion to their burthen than those in present use the expence of navigation would be much diminished The difference of distance be∣tween  America  and the Gulphs of  Bothnia  and  Finland  from  London  is inconsiderable and  America  is nearest to  Lisbon Cadiz  and all the markets to the  Southward  of  Cape Finisterre  and therefore might more conve∣niently supply those markets  THE inconvenience and even absurdity of being supplied with Naval Stores by foreign∣ers besides the disadvantage of consuming the national wealth is very evident Every one knows that should a war be entered into with those  nations or should they be confederated with the enemies of  Britain  by cutting off the sinews of her strength they might reduce her to the utmost distresses Both inconve∣niences would be remedied if Naval Stores were entirely procured from  America  who being connected with the Mother Country by every powerful tie would not fail to afford them in plenty on any emergency  HEMP Flax and Silk manufactured and unmanufactured are articles for which  Britain  pays large sums to foreigners as was ob∣served before Rough materials may be procured in the Colonies which abound with low bottoms and deep rich soils requiring only cultivation to produce the most luxuriant crops of Hemp and Flax particularly in the  Southern  Colonies To confirm this I might mention the fertility of  Egypt  which lies nearly under the same parallels of latitude with  Florida Georgia Carolina  and  Virginia  and is famous for the production of these commodities in the greatest perfection but experience is preferable to a thousand ar∣guments  I MENTION Silk because the abundance of Mulberrytrees in the  Southern  Colonies seems naturally to point out the cultivation of that valuable article To this may be added that their soil climate and marme situation are pretty much the same with  Nankin  and  Chekiang  the most famous Silk provinces in all  China  These circumstances afford good reason to believe the Silkworm would thrive very well here and experience heightens the belief into certainty Small trials have been made and some silk produced in  Carolina  was esteemed by good judges equal to the finest of  China  or  Italy  The hands employed in the cultivation of Hemp and Flax will have suf∣ficient leisure to gather the leaves and feed the worms which will enable the planters to afford all these articles cheaper than may at first be imagined  FROM this it seems evident that materials for carrying on the Silk and Linen manu∣factories to the greatest extent may be pro∣cured from  America  And in  GreatBritain  are prodigious numbers of poor who would chearfully work to maintain themselves and families doom'd to misery for want of em∣ployment  To establish manufactories of those goods by public encouragement would therefore be an undertaking of the highest utility both to  Britain  and the Colonies  "Fas est et ab hoste doceri"  It could be no disgrace to imitate in this respect the policy of  France  who knowing that trade is the only solid foundation of greatness is en∣deavouring to monopolize the three grand branches of manufactures  NOR need the woollen manufacturer be afraid that his business would hereby receive the smallest prejudice There is a sufficient number of hands in the three kingdoms to carry on each of them to the greatest ad∣vantage Many who at present can't afford themselves the necessary covering would then be able to purchase more decent and com∣fortable cloathing and the Colonies having their sources of remittance enlarged would increase their already enormous demands for  British  manufactures  SHOULD this beneficial scheme be carried into execution more than two millions would be annually saved to the nation ade∣quate  employment provided for an incredible number of hands in  Britain  and  America  and the trade navigation and riches of both would receive very large additions  IT may possibly be thought from my ap∣pearing to confine fabrication to  GreatBritain  that I am no friend to the Colonies as there has of late been so many proposals for erect∣ing manufactories in  America  I should esteem myself very unhappy in the displeasure of my countrymen None of the numerous sons of  British America  more ardently wishes her prosperity than myself or has a heart more devoted to her service Conscious there∣fore of the rectitude of my intentions I will not doubt of being heard with candor tho' I venture to maintain that to divert their hands from their present lucrative Employments and set them to work on manufactories would be incompatible with the true interest of the Colonies  THE number of their inhabitants though near three millions is small in proportion to the extent of continent they possess Lands are consequently cheap and labour dear  whatever therefore can be produced by means of the land with little labour must prove most advantageous Hence arises the pro∣priety of shipbuilding wherein the materials thus procurable are of primary consideration  For the same reason agriculture will bring more emolument to the Colonies than could possibly arise from manufacturing goods whose chief value depends on the artificer's labour Nor will this circumstance render them at all more dependent Abounding with the necessaries of life and materials for fabrication the produce of the willing earth they can at any time  command  a supply of the goods they want in greater plenty and of a better quality than would have been the result of their labour employed in manufactures I would not be understood by this reasoning to exclude the industrious farmer from work∣ing up his Wool and other coarse articles unfit for exportation this will be doubly advantageous it will be a saving to himself and enable him to pay for the finer goods he may purchase with greater ease and punc∣tuality  Now upon a review of the whole we find that the trade of  GreatBritain  to some places is vastly advantageous bringing large sums of money into the kingdom to others al∣though no returns are made in specie but as much of their produce and manufactures re∣ceived as is sent them of  British  it is never∣theless profitable affording employment for her people to a third sort though perhaps lucrative to some private merchants it is very pernicious and unprofitable to the nation in general as it drains the kingdom of great quantities of gold and silver We may also observe that the necessity of continuing the latter is removed by the colonies which are capable of furnishing at least materials for manufacturing all the particulars procured thereby with mutual benefit It likewise appears that a great part of her most ad∣vantageous trade depends on the Colonies and that it may be still farther improved by  America  that whilst the Colonies have contri∣buted so much to enrich and aggrandize their mother country they have themselves been enriched and protected and that the scheme for rendering them still more advantageous to  Britain  promises them an equal share of profit  WHOEVER considers these circumstances will I am persuaded anticipate my conclu∣sion but I cannot dismiss the subject without suggesting another argument which will not be esteemed a trifling one by men of serious∣ness and reflection The benefits arising from the Protestant Religion to those states which have embraced it and indeed to the world in general are very obvious Every one ac∣quainted with the affairs of  Europe  must ac∣knowledge their situation is far better than it was four or five centuries ago the religious and civil liberties of mankind are understood with more clearness and precision the human mind which before was crampt and confined in its researches has become more expanded and acquired much clearer knowledge in the Arts in Philosophy and Divinity It is now very well known that Philosophy does not consist in monkish jargon and that without Virtue there can be no Religion Even those countries that are enemies to Protestantism have been sharers in its happy essects the rays of knowledge have in some measure illuminated their clouded understandings but like those of the sun within the  Polar  climates they are weak and languid  GreatBritain  has been the bulwark of the Protestant interest ever since its existence and by her the attacks of its enemies have been repelled The  British  Colonies esta∣blished on principles of Civil and Religious Liberty have hitherto been protected therein by their own noble efforts and her kind assistance and while they remain united the enjoyment of their liberties of both kinds will no doubt be continued in its full extent What would be the consequence of a dis∣union none can tell but there is more than a probability that these particulars would be deeply affected  France  our everwatchful enemy will be ready to seize any advantage that may offer She would have her arma∣ments prepared to enter by  St Lawrence  and the  Missisippi  and might possibly overrun all the Colonies Should this be the case the candle of Science would be soon extin∣guished and Ignorance introduced in order to keep up a blind devotion and implicit obedience The Genius of Liberty would be driven from  British America  where she hath hitherto delighted to reside and whether the mother country would be more fortunate I leave to the consideration of her Patriot Sons ALL  SINCE then so many reciprocal advantages are the result of Union between  Britain  and  America  to render that Union perpetual will be the only means of securing and transmit∣ing them to posterity together with those immense benefits which are yet in prospect Interest and affectionall the tender and endearing ties which connect mankind backed by the venerable authority of Religion plead for it with irresistable eloquence  WHETHER the Union ought to remain on its present establishment or whether it should receive a new form and impression are mat∣ters foreign to my purpose Only permit me to suggest that in the important determina∣tion no partial views should be pursued but the interest of each and its relation to the whole should have a proper consideration He must be either a madman or a novice in politicks who would set the interest of one in competition with that of the otherThey are inseperably connected and must stand or fall togetherThat maxim of Mr  Pope  may be here applied with much truth and propriety"Self love and social are the same" each will find their accounts in pro∣moting  the others happiness and prosperity In the discussion the trade of the colonies me∣rits a peculiar attention Should those me∣thods I have taken the liberty to mention be fallen upon to enlarge it and free ports established in some parts of  British America  the national riches would be greatly increased The inhabitants of the  Spanish Portuguese  and other  American  settlements would resort thither for supplies of  British  manufactures and the produce of the Colonies leaving in exchange for them large quantities of gold and silver a very considerable part of which would ultimately center in  GreatBritain  WARMED and animated with a sincere love for my country I cannot but indulge a pleas∣ing hope that  Britain  and her colonies sen∣sible of their true interest will steadily and with unremitting zeal pursue measures calcu∣lated to cement this UnionThe repeal of a late  The American Stamp Act  act of the  British  parliament and the present favourable disposition of that most respectable body fill us with the highest joy and promise redress of all our grievances and I am well persuaded my fellow subjects  of  America  will not be wanting in any pro∣per expressions of deference and subordina∣tion to the head of the  British  empire The wound which seemed to be attended with symptoms fatal to the mutual confidence sub∣sisting between them will now be healed and I flatter myself without a scar by way of remembrance Jealousies will subside ani∣mosities be forgotten harmony will be pre∣served in every part of the body politick and innumerable blessings entailed on poste∣rity  END OF SECOND DISSERTATION  DISSERTATION III  Divide et impera  H  OWEVER mankind as indivi∣duals may be swayed by the different motives of passion pre∣judice and honour yet when formed into states and communities these all subside and Interest becomes the grand pre∣vailing principle that actuates all their moti∣ons It is the Polestar by which the political pilot must ever guide the helm of govern∣ment where too keen a pursuit of it does not interfere with the faith of treaties or the natural rights of mankind An accurate dis∣cernment therefore of the true interest of a nation and a steady active prudence in the pursuit of it constitute the true political wisdom that ought to distinguish every states∣man  And so sensible are ministers of every complexion of the truth of this doctrine that however selfish and pernicious their views they seldom fail to cover them over with the plausible and specious colouring of na∣tional advantage  THE establishing a grand COMMERCIAL INTEREST seems now to be the great ob∣ject of the regard and attention of the different states of Europe To this they are every day sacrificing the less important considerations of national pride and prejudice Whatever therefore tends to promote or obstruct this great principle of government is now become a matter of serious consequence which deserves the closest attention and the tenderest care And amidst the rivalship and contention of the several European powers in attaining this capital point happy will that nation be whose administration shall lead to such measures as are most conducive to this end as a superi∣ority may now be gained that may blast the hopes and at once dash the expectations of its aspiring competitors  IF there is any one who at present bids fair∣est for this preeminence it is  GreatBritain  whose free and happy constitution most ad∣mirably protects and cherishes an enterprizing commercial spirit A security of person and property is essentially necessary to the very being of a  commercial nation  and in this re∣spect none of its rivals can claim superiority to the happy subjects of  Britain  whose wise and valiant ancestors have handed down to them this glorious security sealed with their blood But not even this nor her natural situation so well adapted for safety from her enemies and the advancement of her trade nor yet the active genius and temper of her children may be sufficient to ensure her suc∣cess if her colonies are neglected or oppress∣ed If properly attended to they will prove the true sources of her wealth and power and enable her to soar above her emulating neigh∣bours who will view her rapid progress with envy and admiration To enumerate the many mutual advantages they have already received from their close and intimate con∣nection would be no easy taskbut it would require little less than inspiration to forsee all the reciprocal advantages that will attend a future Union between them formed upon proper upon generous principles  To point out those that are most obvious and which must necessarily follow is the de∣sign of this Essay which pretends to no more than sketching out the imperfect outlines of a picture whose beauty has indeed been shaded but we trust and believe that time and experience will point out those blemishes and soon restore it to its former purity and lustre To facilitate this has been the design of the generous friend to this institution who proposed the discussion of the present subject and it is a design worthy the benevolent patriotic spirit of an English Senator  Rome  the mistress of the world and arbiter of nations by her wise policy and prudent con∣duct to her allies and colonists raised herself to an astonishing pitch of grandeur and power she encouraged she incorporated and never deprived them of any essential privileges By these rules she gained their affections and of factious turbulent citizens and often of in∣vererate enemies she made faithful zealous and useful subjects  GreatBritain  has at much expence of blood and treasure secured and protected her  American  colonies from the designs of  France  who viewed their rising power and growing importance with a jealous eye and therefore determined to nip them in  the bud before they could ripen to any de∣gree of formidable perfection Happily for us these ambitious and fatal projects were crushed by the united valour and skill of  GreatBritain  and her provinces To a hap∣py and successful Union in War let us then add the happy and harmonious Union of Peace nor lose its blessings by inattention to or disregard of the inestimable advantages that may nay that must attend it  Colonies are emigrations from the mother country either occasioned by a quick Popula∣tion so as to render it too small for the support of its growing inhabitants or by Oppression Tyranny and undue exercise of Power or sometimes by the distresses and desolation of War  In the first case they are always formed not only with the countenance but with the express encouragement and direction of the mother countryIn the second instance un∣less prohibited by legal authority they ge∣nerally go with its implyed consent In the last which was the case of the  Trojans  after the destruction of  Troy  they go under a ne∣cessity which is superior to all law In either of these cases then but especially the two  first they cannot be supposed to relinquish their claim to any of the rights and privileges of the country from which they go nor yet to have forfeited it No however remote they still continue subjects of the same kingdom and unless specially relinquished intituled to all the liberties privileges and immunities of that country of which they form one or more of the constituent parts If this be as true in fact as it is grateful in supposition the analogy made by an eminent writer  Dr Strahan's Preface to Domat's Civil Law  between the  American  colonies and those of  Spain  which he supposes to be settled upon the same principles and therefore to be governed by the same policy must appear very strange But the principle upon which it is founded is as erroneous as the consequence deduced from it is derogatory to ENGLISH LIBERTY  The AMERICAN COLONIES have been entire∣settled by those who came under the immedi∣ate protection and countenance of the govern∣ment or fled to it as an asylum from arbi∣trary and oppressive power A due consider∣ation of the rights they claim and the duties they owe to the mother country may be ne∣cessary in some degree to ascertain with pre∣cision the advantages that will accrue from a  compleat and perfect Union These  rights  and  duties  are RECIPROCAL as well as the Interest which arises from them  THE  Rights  we claim are the  full  and  free  enjoyment of CONSTITUTIONAL LIBERTY PROTECTION from foreign invasions and  en∣couragement  in every  commercial interest  which does not directly interfere with that of the mother country  THE  Duties  we owe are OBEDIENCE under  constitutional  and  legal  restrictions and an exclusive preference to the mother country in every article of commerce and trade Under one or other of these heads however widely diffused may be comprized every duty either owing to or from the mother country And and it is by a due and mutual observance of these only that their respective and reciprocal interests can be promoted From this just and wise policy will flow all those advantages which render a close and perfect Union so de∣sirable an objectand these may be consider∣ed either as they tend to increase the power and glory of  GreatBritain  or as they ad∣vance its grand commercial interest and  become the channels of its wealth Or with regard to the Colonies as they conduce to their safety nourishment and protection for though the true riches of a nation are said to consist in the number of its inhabitants and treasures are called the sinews of war it is very certain a nation may be very poor and very powerful at the same time or abound with wealth and yet be weak and impotent  Rome  in its early ages was poor in every thing but the public spirit and bravery of her people while she was the dread and terror of the nations round her And  Spain  is at present a lively instance that wealth and power are not inseparable who as the treasures of the  Indies  have flowed in upon her has lost the martial animated spirit of her ancestors  As subjects of the same kingdom bearing allegiance to the same Prince and controuled by the same executive power the  Americans  are bound to contribute in proportion to their numbers and abilities to the defence and safety of the common cause What an accession of power to the  British  empire then is three millions of subjects dutiful loyal and brave who have on many occasions  distinguished themselves and shewn they were not unworthy the glorious stock from which they sprung who interest themselves in the honour and glory of the nation and partake of the veneration and respect due to it  HERE is a fund of hardy brave soldiers inured to fatigue and frugality ready to engage in the service of  GreatBritain  when∣ever she thinks proper to require them From this fruitful this increasing source her armies and navies may receive constant supplies not of mercenary hierlings ready to engage in the service of the highest bidder but faithful dutiful children animated with becoming fortitude freedom and loyalty These if encouraged cherished and protect∣ed will indeed prove  "Of  Britain  's empire the support and strength"  Thompson  IN order to make a colony of the most use and benefit to the mother country it is ne∣cessary that its climate its soil and natural  produce should be essentially different from hers This will create a necessary connection and dependance between them The Inter∣changing the commodities and produce of the one for those of the other will not only destroy the heartburnings and jealousy of a competition but produce an intercourse equally beneficial and durable to both It is happy therefore when the subjects of  Com∣merce  cannot be the same as they thereby reap an advantage from which other nations are excluded who might either by with∣holding distress them or raise the ballance against them when their necessities were not mutual and equal In this respect  GreatBritain  is peculiarly happy in her Colonies whose wide extent and different situations in∣clude a variety of climates soils and produce and thus form a proper basis for the com∣mercial interest to which every other con∣sideration should submit The islands produce commodities which the mother country must use and yet cannot raise these therefore she must procure by an intercourse with her co∣lonies or lie at the mercy of those powers whose interest it might occasionally be to  distress her But what adds to the ad∣vantage is that the subjects of commerce are not only easily procured but procured by a mutual exchange equally convenient and satisfactory to both and at the same time a large revenue secured not only upon the home consumption but on the surplus be∣yond their respective wants and necessities Thus also as to the continent  GreatBritain  both as a naval and commercial nation would be in a critical dangerous situation if she did not hold within her own reach all the materials necessary for the support of both An intire dependance upon any of her neigh∣bours for one necessary article would in some degree make her subject to that neighbour But her Colonies set her above every appre∣hension of this kind Her  Northern  provinces abound with timber of every kind necessary for building and equipping her navies Im∣mense bodies of Ore both Iron and Copper are already discovered and usefully employ∣ed and doubtless much more lies still con∣cealed in the bowels of the earth whose soil it properly cultivated and encouraged is richly productive of Hemp and Flax for  the former of which  GreatBritain  pays  com∣munibus annis  £ sterling Her more  Southern  Colonies furnish her with the few remaining marine articles of Pitch Tar and Turpentine  HERE then are found all the materials of Timber Iron Cordage and every other spe∣cies of Naval Stores necessary for the support nay the existence of  GreatBritain  as a ma∣ritime power Should I here mention bodies of Saltpetre the spontaneous produce of the earth I may perhaps be thought too pre∣mature but if the promising appearances of that useful and expensive but neccssary com∣modity be happily confirmed here is a new source of national wealth and independance A large and constant ballance which  GreatBritain  pays to the  Indies  in specie will be instantly saved and a surer quicker and cheaper supply at once secured Next to the subjects of COmmerce which are neces∣sary to enable the mother country to main∣tain her independance and rank among the other powers or  Europe  we may place all these which are articles of convenience Luxury and the surplus of those com∣modities  which are not applied to naval purposes The real and absolute necessaries of life are but few the subjects of Com∣merce are many and various as they contri∣bute not only to the real but the imaginary capricious wants of mankind To provide therefore against these wants upon advan∣tageous terms is a just and necessary policy and there are few very few of these articles which the colonists cannot furnish under proper encouragements The islands tender the various produce of their climate equal in quantity and quality with those of their neigh∣bours The  Southern  Colonies of  NorthAmerica  have as far as the infancy of the country will permit produced the different articles of Silk Rice Indigo Tobacco and even the Tea plant has not been altogether uncultivated Some of these have been car∣ried to a much greater degree of cultivation than others but where it has  GreatBritain  has received a proportionate benefit In the instance of Tobacco only she has become not only the sole vender but almost the sole ma∣nufacturer for  Europe  besides the immense revenue flowing immediately into her ex∣chequer  WINES are an article of luxury and it is perhaps upon that account they have not been so much attended to by the frugal temperate  American  but it is certain not only from theory but experience that the situation and soil of many parts of this ex∣tended continent are well adapted for pro∣ducing them To what degree of perfection not only the cultivation of these but the other articles of convenience and luxury may arrive is difficult to determine but it is easy to see that the great the eventual profit will terminate in  GreatBritain  I mentioned before the produce of the Colonies as Naval Stores but considered as the raw materials of great and extensive manufactories which give bread to thousands and of idle clamorous starving subjects make useful and industrious citizens I cannot err when I say they are immensely useful to their mother country Upon a view of the foreign trade of  GreatBritain  we shall find that except that to  Portugal  the ballance is against her in every one To  Russia  to  Sweden  to  Denmark  to  Germany  she pays annually large sums in specie for those very commodities which her  American  Colonies can and do produce and a great writer has observed  That a country  which constantly exports fewer manufac∣tures or commodities than it receives will soon find the ballance sinking will re∣ceive less and less till falling into extreme poverty it will receive nothing at all  HERE then we may trace the great utility of the Colonies not only that they afford a con∣stant and sure supply of the subjects of com∣merce necessary for the support of the power and manufactures of the mother country but in that she has an indisputable exclusive preference in the sale of them and the Colo∣nies in return are the fixed and constant customers for all her manufactures and com∣modities to which they are indispensably obliged to give the preference over those of other countries for as the design of colo∣nizing was not to found a new empire but to extend the old there is no impropriety in appropriating the trade of the Colonies to the mother country only If the ballance was therefore in favour of Colonies as is the case between  GreatBritain  and the  EastIndies  it would be more eligible it should fall into the hands of its own subjects however remote than into those of a foreign power But where that ballance is actually and  greatly in favour of the mother country it becomes an interest that ought to be very dear to the cultivating of which the greatest care and attention of government should be applied That this is the case of  GreatBritain  and her continential Colonies the vast exportation of bullion and the still remain∣ing debt of five millions most evidently evince With what a rapid astonishing pro∣gress this beneficial this lucrative trade has advanced the growing increase of the ex∣ports declare which arose from the Year from £ to the amazing amount of £ To this the mo∣ther country in a great measure owes her con∣tinuance as a trading nation when deprived of her valuable Levant trade and her inter∣course even with  Portugal  greatly diminished and lessened by her active industrious rivals the  French  and  Dutch  It is from this foun∣tain those treasures flow which enable her to pay the respective ballances to those countries with whom she trades on a disadvantageous footing  America  it is true does not extract them immediately from her own bowels She has a more valuable and durable resource in  in the labour and industry of her inhabitants who exchange the surplus of their commodi∣ties beyond their own consumption and which might in some respects interfere with the staples of the mother country or at least be useless to her for those treasures which are only valuable to the colonists as they enable them to discharge past and contract future engagements for the manufactures of  GreatBritain  WHILE therefore she possesses a market which she can call  exclusively  her own subject to her own regulations and the ballance always in her favour whatever the Colonies may acquire from any collateral branches of trade will quickly flow to the mother coun∣try as the great centre of all their external prosits To restrain therefore or rather stop up those channels of remittance is in effect to prohibit the consumption of the manufactures of  GreatBritain  as our desires to procure them have at all times been equal to and sometimes exceed our ability to pay for them Whence it follows that a policy which ensures a small immediate revenue at the expence of a great though indirect  national gain is mean and sordid unworthy the noble enterprizing spirit of a commercial nation  BUT I should leave this subject very imper∣fect indeed if I should omit two great funds of national wealth and power the FISHERIES and the FURTRADE The first of these is a mine richer than that of  Potosi  and more inexhaustible For while our Fisheries serve as a great subject of commerce they are also a fruitful nursery of brave hardy seamen trained up to fatigue to difficulty and danger  THE FURTRADE which is now secured almost beyond the reach of accident is dou∣bly valuable as it is enjoyed solely and ex∣clusively an advantage which is not confined to a monopoly of the raw materials and en∣hances their price only but enables  GreatBritain  to be both the merchant and the manufacturer also and that upon her own terms while other nations must depend up∣on a precarious uncertain supply which which may either be raised in its price or totally withheld as the fluctuating policy of interest or friendship shall require This  acquisition is not only valuable as it will probably revive a languishing dying manu∣factory but as it is a present an actual and considerable source of revenue both on the home consumption and also on that of foreigners  THESE are a few of the principal advantages with which a proper cultivation establishment and tender regard of the Colonies may be attended to the mother country She has likewise many inferior ones The residence of those of affluent fortunes who may be led thi∣ther by veiws of education or mere curiosity is not altogether unworthy regard These all depend on and can only flow from a perfect compleat Unionby supporting that relati∣onship between the Mother country and her Colonies which has planted in their bosoms so strong and lively an affection as to dis∣tinguish  GreatBritain  by the tender endear∣ing appellation of HOME  BUT 'tis time now that we should turn to the COLONIES and see what advantages they may propose to themselves from a dutiful and affectionate UNION with the mother country and from our past feelings we shall readily  acknowledge we stand in need of her protec∣tion nurture and care Exposed by our situation by a rivalship and competition of Interests and yet in a state of infancy it would be extremely difficult if not impos∣sible to form any Union among ourselves that would be sufficient to repel the attacks of a formidable invader In this weak this defenceless state therefore we must look up to our indulgent parent whose vigorous salutary aid we have so often already expe∣rienced Upon her we must rely for support and under her wing shelter ourselves against any attempts of those whose principles and government are incompatible with our Re∣ligion and Liberty A separation would be attended with certain ruin to the Colonies in thier present situation as they must ne∣cessarily fall a prey to one or other of those powers who would snatch with eagerness so tempting a prize  THE first principle of nature selfpreser∣vation therefore dictates to the Colonies a steady a strict adherence to the mother coun∣try as upon that depends the enjoyment of every invaluable privilege of a civil or religi∣ous nature But we may not only consider her  as the protector but as the nursing mother of her Colonies Arts Sciences Agriculture and Commerce rise by slow degrees and are long before they arrive to any degree of per∣fection They are not of quick or spon∣taneous growth They must be planted cherished and encouraged And have we not experienced the tenderness of our mother country in this respect by her bounties dis∣persed not only in public channels but by private societies and patriotic individuals Have we not reason to expect a continuance and perhaps an increase of her benevolent efforts in our behalf Thus taking our enter∣prizing genius by the hand and leading it on in the paths of industry and useful im∣provements  To turn the attention of the Colonies to the cultivation of those subjects of Commerce which the mother country does not or can∣not produce tho' to her it may be eventually profitable is to the Colonies immediately and directly so and when it is done by mild by bountiful measures deserves our gratitude and thankful returns A fixed and perma∣nent UNION between  GreatBritain  and her Colonies is absolutely necessary for the pre∣servation  of the peace and harmony of their internal administration For to form the constitution and plan of a new government or even to new model and revise the old is no easy or inconsiderable task That of the mother country has been the work of ages and to use the words of an eminent writer seems dictated by wisdom itself While therefore the colonists can enjoy all the bles∣sings of an  English  constitution undiminished and uninterrupted it would be superlative madness and folly to run the risk of a change which could not possibly be for the better and might be infinitely worse Unconnected and divided as they are at present both in situation and interest owing to the difference of Settlement of Charters of Religion and Commerce which are often clashing how difficult and next to impossible would it be to rescue them from a state of anarchy and form a constitution for which I will venture to say from the extent of  America  there can no precedent be found a constitution which at the same time that it reconciles these jar∣ring interests must preserve every religious and civil Liberty intire  THE difficulties of an Union for the purposes of empire are almost insuperable To canton out the provinces into petty independent kingdoms besides the arduous task of settling the internal police would subject them not only to perpetual quarrels with each other but render them an easy prey to some foreign power as they would singly be weak though united under one head truly formidable The only remaining resource of desperate distress must be to form the provinces into districts having full power of legislation within themselvesbut subject to the con∣troul of some supreme superintendant au∣thority raised out of the collective body as in some instances in  Germany  or with more probability like  Holland  or  Switzerland  But this the vast extent of the Colonies will render almost impossible as it would give being to an aristocracya kind of government as re∣pugnant to the genius and temper of  America  as despotic monarchy  I THEREFORE repeat it that the preser∣vation of our laws commerce and every other blessing of domestic peace by the wise policy of the mother country can only be made the basis of a close and firm connection between her and them  NEXT to the security of a state its wealth and convenience are to be regarded and to judge how beneficial  GreatBritain  is to the Colonies in this respect it may be proper to remark that as other countries produce the same commodities and have hitherto been able to undersell the  Americans  in a variety of articles wherever an exclusive or even a pre∣ferable market has been given to the latter the advantage must be obvious This has been done in many instances by prohibitions or by duties charged on such commodities as interfered with those from the Colonies which in some cases amount to a prohibition The  British  Whale Fishery has been almost wholly given up in favour of the  American  Fisheries Sugars Hemp Indigo and Tobacco besides a variety of other articles from the Colo∣nies have met with every mark of encourage∣ment while the same commodities from other countries have been discountenanced or whol∣ly prohibited This is wise and just policy in the mother country at the same time that it discovers a tender regard to her children and makes it their interest to unite more closely In short they have every thing that can make a nation great happy and power∣ful to hope from a Union every thing that is dangerous to fear from a division  "Divide et impera"  was the  Roman  mot∣to May it not be applicable to  GreatBritain  and her  American  Colonies who if united have proved themselves equal nay superior to two of the principal powers of  Europe  but if divided if struggling with in∣testine commotions and civil discord I fear will prove unable to contend with either This to use the expression of a great and eminent friend of the Colonies is the  grand  FAMILY COMPACT which must be cemented by every tie of duty loyalty and affection from the Provinces and every mark of kind protecting tenderness from the mother coun∣try A fatal underscerning policy had almost snapt these interesting cords asunder never perhaps to have been closed again but the guardian genius of  Britain  and of  America  stept between them and ruin and with out∣stretched hand saved a sinking nation  THE  Romans  decreed a crown to him who saved the life of a citizen in battle but what crowns or statues can do sufficient honour to the Man or Men who save a country a king∣dom in the hour of distress and rescue a fal∣ling state from the brink of ruin  Rome  may justly boast her  Brutus  's her  Curtius  's her  Cato  's and her  Tully  's they were the PITTS the  Conways  and the  Barres  of that age alike warmed by the sacred fire of  Liberty  alike crowned with Immortality and handed down to posterity the wonder and delight of ad∣miring nations These glorious architects nobly aided by many others whose names will be held in long veneration have prop'd the tottering fabrick of the  British  EMPIRE and pointed out that noble generous policy which will make one great system of govern∣ment whereof  Britain  will be the common centre of attraction  UNDER such a policy we can with joy look forwards and behold PEACE LIBERTY and COMMERCE diffusing their kindly influence over all the parts of GREATBRITAIN's  Em∣pire  whose true happiness and permanent security can be no way effectually established but by "a perpetual UNION between her and her AMERICAN COLONIES"  End of DISSERTATION III  DISSERTATION IV  By FRANCIS HOPKINSON  Esq  A  T this important juncture when the eyes of all  America  are lifted to the mother country in anxious expectation when trembling fear or bold defiance enlivening hope or mysteri∣ous surmise distract every breast and sit in every brow what subject can be more inte∣resting than the "Reciprocal advantages of a perpetual Union between  GreatBritain  and her Colonies" and yet there is no subject perhaps which the public is so little disposed to receive with candour and judge of with impartiality How then shall a native of  America  and an unexperienced writer es∣pecially in matters of such high importance presume to draw his pen But the worthy Gentleman who has proposed this subject and back'd his proposal with the reward of distinguished honour has raised in us who are  candidates on this occasion that ambition which hath in all ages prompted men to greater undertakings than cooler judgement would have suffered them to engage in  I Do not mean in this  little Essay  to cal∣culate the advantages of  trade  between  GreatBritain  and her Colonies in order to shew that they are  reciprocal  By the very nature of Commerce they must be so There is no country in the world that exports staple com∣modities or manufactures but for an advantage to be gained or imports them but for the same reason  As the God of nature has adapted different countries to abound in different kinds of pro∣duce or excell in various useful arts it is evident that a commercial intercourse must redound to the benefit of the whole But how must this advantage be increased when we consider that  GreatBritain  in her trade with her Colonies does not support a foreign peo∣ple whose religion politics and customs are different from her own but she supports and nourishes her own offspring at the same time that she enriches herself by the natural profits of an extensive trade and she strengthens herself by protecting and encouraging her own religion government and customs trans∣planted to  America  COMMERCE between  GreatBritain  and her Colonies is like the wholesome food which a man eats He cannot say his head his hands or his feet are more particularly bene∣fited by it but the finer parts thereof circu∣late through the whole body and the whole body is nourished and supported  THE three grand objects worthy the atten∣tion of a wise people are the state of their  Commerce Liberty  and  Religion  If the  Com∣merce  the  Liberty  and  Religion  both of  GreatBritain  and her Colonies can alone be sup∣ported and strengthened by a close and lasting Union between them then the  reciprocal ad∣vantages  of such an UNION must be selfevident  I HAVE slightly touched the first of these There have been so many accurate mercantile calculations made in almost every pamphlet that has been lately published on the subject that I take it for granted as a truth universally admitted that the advantages of trade between  GreatBritain  and her Colonies are reciprocal  WITH respect to  political Liberty  should it not be the glory of  England  to transplant to water and carefully to nurse even in a  distant land a system of government which is the admiration of the world and should not  America  adopt and chearfully submit to such a government Were it possible for  GreatBritain  with an high and arbitrary hand to think of snatching from her Colonies the essential privileges of  Englishmen  and yet would have them submit as  Englishmen  to her government and bear only the name and ap∣pearance of the freeborn sons of Liberty it would be to dress her slaves in livery and deck  America  in robes of paper to make her the contempt and derision of every other nation On the other hand should the Colonies with base ingratitude attempt to throw off all dependance on the mother country they would put themselves in the situation of a silly girl who leaves the guidance and pro∣tection of a wise and affectionate parent and wandering away exposes herself to ruin by the artful insinuations of every wicked and designing stranger But why should the mutual connection between the parent∣country and her Colonies ever come into question Are we not one nation and one people And do we not own obedience to  one common King Those who adopt the same religion the same plans of government and the same customs are undoubtedly of the same nation Different climates and dif∣ferent soils mark out countries but not nations We of  America  are in all respects  Englishmen  notwithstanding that the  Atlantic  rolls her waves between us and the throne to which we all own allegiance Nor can we though in ever so flourishing a state throw off our dependance or dissolve this  Union  with∣out breaking the very bonds of nature As well might the branch say unto the trunk See how I glow with blossoms and wave with foliage I have no further need of thy sap keep it for thy own nourishment  ON the other hand does not  GreatBritain  by transplanting her constitution into  America  as a scion from the stock propagate her own likeness Nay does she not make unto her∣self another crown and another sceptre  IN all attacks that shall be made upon  GreatBritain  by the numerous rivals of her power and enemies to her prosperity her colonies like a number of dutiful and pro∣mising  children growing up round her will more and more add to her strength and contribute to her importance And should it ever happen amid the revolution of things human that those enemies should prevail against her what could her sons lose but the beautiful island they have so long possessed Even in that case which we trust and believe will never happen they might find in the Colonies a sure asylum thither they might remove with all the noble privileges of their constitution as to a people and coun∣try they can call their own and the  British  throne might yet shine with undiminished glory even in the present wilds of  America  LASTLY with respect to the religious li∣berties of the people of  England  how precious they are let the price which has been paid for them declare And these will be as much strengthened by a perpetual  Union  with the colonies as their civil liberties  BUT exclusive of this consideration it cer∣tainly must be the glory of  GreatBritain  to propagate protect and encourage in her co∣lonies that sacred system of religious truth  which she holds so dear Indeed that she herself judges in this manner is evident from her many charitable donations for promoting the interest of learning and virtue in  America  IN short the Protestant Religion and par∣ticularly that excellent branch of it the na∣tional Church of England is the pure and healthful air in which the political constitution of  GreatBritain  moves and breathes with health and vigour religious Liberty being hereby fixed on as firm and broad a basis as Civil Liberty both of which are so essentially interwoven with the nature of her govern∣ment that it cannot be administered without them Nor can her empire be more effec∣tually strengthened than by extending with it whatever she finds valuable in her own pos∣session This is her interest and it must be her honour as it is likewise the interest and honour of the Colonies to receive nourish and join with her in the support of every thing of this kind which can only be done by a perpetual Union between them  How detestable then must the politician be who shall ever attempt to kindle the de∣structive  flames of jealousy between two friends whom nature seems to have united in the closest bonds and whose hearts and in∣terests are and ever ought to be one Should any one ever succeed in this which God for∣bid I doubt not but that after much cruel contention and unnatural bloodshed each would rush into the other's arms and em∣phatically cry out "We are both in the wrong"  THIS subject might be expanded into vo∣lumes and no doubt will be but I leave the full discussion of it to more able hands and humbly hope this  little Essay  will be accepted as the oblation of one who intimately feels the importance of this great truth that "a perpetual Union between  GreatBritain  and her Colonies will ever be reciprocally ad∣vantageous"  FINIS
