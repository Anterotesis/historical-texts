out I venture therefore to lay them once more before the public They were written whilst some of the measures which have brought on our present unexampled calamities were in agitation These effects were then foreseen in their causes It may be worth while to take a review of both Perhaps a further consideration of the inevitable connection between such causes and such effects may have a tendency at length to open late as it is the eyes of some wellmeaning but mistaken supporters of that unfortunate system  The great business of this time is the business of us all ministers allow not only our concern in the question but our competency to judge of it By courting our favour they have confessed our importance Never was the public approbation of official measures solicited with such an importunate assiduity Not satisfied with the labours of the press the pulpit is taken into the service We see the spirit of pride ambition and despotism domineering in the sanctuary of humility longsuffering and selfdenial War and blood come recommended from the oracles of peace and forgiveness As our ministry equally employ the regular and the savage to fight their battles so they use indiscriminately the orthodox divine and the field preacher to animate the unthinking multitude to their new Western crusadea crusade far more wild than any of those fanatick expeditions which in the gloom of obscure ages were preached by monastick enthusiasm to Gothick ignorancea crusade more adverse to the just rights and far more repugnant to all the honest feelings of human nature  These instruments of mischief of all sorts and colours have been employed not only to stimulate our worst passions but by a perversion of those passions to increase their natural blackness and malignity We are taught cruelty and arrogance towards our countrymen meanness and submission to foreign nations In this glorious work they are all employed from the rich contractor who consumes the public revenue down to the poor exciseman who collects it The influence of the crown considerable in peace in war is boundless There is hardly any denomination of men who do not find some immediate advantage in war all this advantage is dealt out by ministry and is dealt out not as it may best serve the purposes of their war but of their faction The expence of every military corps they raise is the means of retaining a large body of venal and therefore most zealous advocates in their cause Their grand aim in all this circulation is to persuade us that our sufferings are the result of our own desires and not of their mismanagements  Availing themselves of the hired loquacity of their agents they assert that the voice of the people is with them Thus every Englishman seems called upon to admit or deny the fact to confess or disclaim his being a party to the public ruin How extensively this delusion and corruption may operate I cannot determine I trust that they have not yet prevailed over the major part of the kingdom There are still  ears  not absolutely closed to all enquiry into our real situation and the merits of that conduct which has plunged us into it We are still in temper enough to examine whether the policy which has alienated three millions of people has been well calculated to conciliate the affections of men whether the measures that have lost an empire have been well adapted to enforce universal obedience  The following letters agitate these questions It seems to me to be a subject that cannot appear too often or in too great a variety of shapes before the public tribunal English good sense may be misled from passion it may be surprised from inattention  but I hope this nation is not yet capable of deliberate nonsense and cool absurdity  The weak and violent measures that have been adopted have as we foresaw and foretold induced all the English of America to cast off entirely the government of this country The ministers have declared that it was always the intention of America to do so and they have certainly taken care that they should want no sort of provocation to justify the carrying that intention into act They have called for  "  unconditioned submission  "  and they have been answered by  "  total independence  "  How far good management may remedy the effects of bad it is impossible to divine but by a war to force unconditioned submission no good can result to the English nation on either side of the water  Whatever we may think of it this war will decide on our own liberties as well as on those of America  If America be reduced to slavery by force of arms the freedom of the conqueror will not long survive the liberty of the vanquished  It is not safe for a state which values itself upon its privileges to contain within itself a large body of people who have no privileges of their own to lose They will always act with that politician who aims at introducing a scheme of  equality  This equality will be much more easily compassed as it will be much more naturally desired by the undertaker by pulling down those above the level than by raising those who are below it When a Prince shall come who wishes to have his subjects slaves he will most certainly have all the slaves in his dominions of his Party When the Roman empire was turned into a monarchy the subject provinces which had been stripped of all their rights by the pride of Rome were unanimously desirous of a Revolution which sunk all distinction in a common servitude  nec earum rerum statum provinciae abnuerant suspecto senatus populique imperio  The ministerial writers and addressers have indeed lately hit upon a curious topic of declamation which has furnished abundant matter of invective against their opponents and of compliment as they pretend  to the King The King say these gentlemen with an unparalleled magnanimity of spirit and an unequalled regard for the constitution  "Above all Greek above all Roman fame"  Refuses the astonishing offer which the Colonies make him of becoming an absolute monarch free from the controul of Parliament over that extensive and growing part of the empire According to these writers their very natural contest is thus circumstanced We behold a Prince exhausting his Exchequer spilling the blood of his best troops and by his requisitions fatiguing every ally he can purchaseand all to prevent an unheard of sort of rape from his own subjects who would compel him against his will to accept an arbitrary authority over them In this representation we see all the subjects in one part of his dominions united with a very large portion of them in another part by every method of violence of faction of sedition and of open rebellion struggling to invest him with a boundless dominion over their lives liberties  and fortunes This is what the ministers are not ashamed to assertand they have even been at the foolish pains and expence of circulating pamphlets to prove it  The situation on the side of the subject is certainly new the distress on the part of the Prince truly affectingIt is by some such misrepresentation undoubtedly that the ministers delude and betray their Sovereign This consideration entirely takes off all  real  blame from the sacred person to whom no blame can be imputed  constitutionally  But whatever success they may meet in their deception I am afraid that the gentlemen concerned in making this representation are themselves perfectly well apprised of its fallacy They will one day tell the King what Lord Sandwich publicly told the Duke of Grafton that they deceived him on purpose to lead him on in their measures For they must be tolerably sensible how ridiculous it is to suppose that the Americans whom they are so violently accusing of republicanism should be shedding their best blood to establish an absolute monarchy That they  who are charged with having always affected an entire independence of this crown mean to give the King an unqualified authority over them is surely rather a little paradoxical  The reality of the fears of our Ministers  "least the King should obtain a revenue independent of Parliament"  appears from their continual complaint that the Colony assemblies make so very poor and precarious a provision for civil Government It is in truth the frugality of these assemblies which the Ministers hate and not their prodigality that they stand in dread of They find it much more  constitutional  to deal with one compliant than with twenty refractory assemblies  They are in the right it is a course infinitely more pleasant to those who govern Parliament will they know be sufficiently liberal of money which is not theirs since they find them so very moderate in its oeconomy of what is properly their own  This serious ministerial dread of the King's enjoying a vast revenue independent of Parliament  appears also by their perfect composure in a danger of the same kind but far more pressing by being so much nearer home Ireland has a pension list of l a year intirely at his Majesty's disposal there are also offices there intirely in his gift to as large an amount besides the extensive disposition of near a million of revenue wholly out of the inspection of the British Parliament  It is surprising with what composure the ministerial magnanimity enables them to sleep with such a mine of power and influence under their pillow and without the least controul This revenue is already much larger than the most sanguine speculation could promise from American assemblies in an hundred years  But the truth is this leaving to the Americans the disposition of their own property can answer no ministerial purposes whatever whether these assemblies make a more liberal or a more reserved use of this power For if the American assemblies should continue in their original  uncivilized churlish savage purity they will certainly grant no more of the substance of their constituents than they are sure will be for the advantage of those who trust them with the disposal of it In this case there will be no additional pensions from America for Mr Jenkinson Lord Clare or Mr Ellis and a long et caetera of Parliamentary and ministerial worthies This is a serious loss and a real subject of alarm to Ministers ruling on the principles that now actuate our public councils  If on the contrary the Crown should by degrees and by good management obtain an influence which might excite the American assemblies to greater generosity the effect would be too remote for the present possessors of power and favour to hope any sort of advantage from it Corruption is not very long sighted Selfishness does not consult succession The interested of today will not provide at their own expence for the profit of the self interested of future times Such posterity they know have  a comfortable inheritance in their own care of themselves and the present generation will not forestall their industry Besides the ministers may be rather apprehensive considering the growing number of the American Representatives that the labourers may devour the whole harvest and leave little or no rent to be returned to the lawful Lords Paramount of Sinecure and pension in Great Britain  These I imagine are the real apprehensions which arise from the idea of permitting the Americans to continue in the old practice of granting their own money since this is the single instance in which we find our politicians under such panic and superstitious fears of the effect of Crown influence In all other respects they are true free thinkers genuine unaffected esprits forts  Whatever their fears or hopes may be they have got us into a war for the charges of which in any event their gain or their loss the good or the ill success of their arms will afford to poor England a very poor indemnity  The ministers have indeed gone such lengths that they think it impossible for us to look back They say that we must now without reflecting on the past endeavour to give all manner of effect to the measures that are on  trial  If any thing rational were on trial it would indeed be wrong not to let it have a fair one but the execution of an illconcerted plan is the very mischief of it it turns speculative absurdity into practical and beginning in ridicule ends in misery Every day that we postpone our remedy it undoubtedly grows the more difficult and the terms of peace will become less honourable  But ill as our condition is something yet remains to be done We have lost authority by injudiciously attempting to obtain a great enlargement of it We may try whether it may not still be possible to recover some substitute at least in friendship and mutual interest for what we have lost in power But a protracted war will destroy even to the seeds of future friendship I am sensible that much is expected  from the vast army which German penury and English prodigality has enabled the ministry to employ They who think that slaughtering burning and plundering are the means of reconciling the minds of the people to our government have but very poor ideas of any government at all Although these cruel injuries may compel submission they are not of power to cancel memory The effect of terror is not lasting but the impressions of hate and resentment are deeply inlaid in the hearts of men The day may come when the affections of America will be looked for as something of value and they are even now worth purchasing even though Hesse and Brunswick were to be defrauded of the largest part of the bloody glories they are to purchase by the slaughter of Englishmenalthough fewer English scalps were to decorate the martial dwellings of the savage allies of our humane ministry  If the following papers can tend ever so little to bring us to a knowledge of our true friends and true enemies the sole end  of the Author who is no actor in this scene on one side or the other is fully answered  VALENS  LETTER I  TRIUMPHS  Saturday September  Mr MILLER  THE ministerial writers in one of those paragraphs with which they enrich the public papers  Vide Public Advertiser  are pleased for the special entertainment of the good people of England to tell them a curious piece of news This intelligence is the more valuable because according to Lord Bacon's expression it comes home to our own business and bosoms  These gentlemen kindly inform us  "that in the annals of the world there is not to be found so extraordinary a nation as our's"  "We place it seems our chief pleasure in discontent and by a retrograde propensity of thinking are never  compleatly happy  without being  compleatly miserable  "  The Ministers have made a valuable discovery in the national character It must be admitted to their honour that none have ever more perfectly profited of their knowledge of mankind or have laboured more successfully to give entire satisfaction to their country By continuing the same benevolent efforts a little longer there is no doubt but that they will perfectly attain their end The people of England are at length in a fair way of being compleatly happy and happy in their own mode  Observers have been for some time at a loss to account for the conduct of Ministry They were not able to enter into the causes of their supine neglects and untimely endeavours They could not penetrate into the motives for their violent denunciations and their feeble efforts for their disinclination to peace and their inability for war for their irritating America to resistance by the austerity of their laws and encouraging that resistance by the weakness of their military arangements The whole is now explained They were seeking for popularity they were conforming themselves to our  retrograde propensities  they were generously labouring for the felicity of a nation which as they have sagaciously discovered  "can never be compleatly happy till they are rendered compleatly miserable"  The benevolence of these good men even extends to their worst enemies They tell us in the same paragraph  "that the modern Patriots shudder at the probability of success in the management of public affairs and brood with a savage delight over the hopes of a national calamity"  The modern Patriots are in truth as unreasonable as they are represented to be factious if they do not gratefully acknowledge the incredible pains that Ministry has taken to please them They have engaged us in a war after such a Patriot's own heart Envy and malignity would have bespoke it In this war the object the conduct the probability of success are all exactly alike  We are struggling it seems to obtain a revenue by force which that very force must for ever disable the Colonies from yielding At the same time we are incurring expences that no wealth in the subjugated Provinces and no chearfulness in granting it can ever defray  The scene of the war is on the other side of the Atlantic ocean There we have no assistance no alliance not a single friend Thither we are to transport the flower of the English youth consigned to slaughter disease and famine Every thing necessary to the support of war or to the sustenance of life even to the minutest articles of both must be conveyed to the British troops from hence at the expence of millions and at the  mercy of winds and seas The supply of great armies even in the midst of the most plentiful countries and in the most commodious situations is chargeable difficult and sometimes precarious What a work then must the subsistance of an army be I mean an army sufficient to produce any effect in a country three thousand miles distant from home In a country where the provision for a single day cannot be purchased Every sinister incident every unfavourable event must be repaired if it can at all be repaired from the distance of degrees of longitude and the least delay or misfortune attending the supply puts an end to the operations of an whole campaign  Whilst the Ministerial operations are clogged with these difficulties the Americans are training and  The wonderful march of Arnold in our Gazette par excellence I suppose stiled  one  Arnold is some proof of the justness of this reasoning  hardening themselves to war The continuance of the quarrel inures them to the state of things into which they are fallen They are in the midst of their resources With whatever vain hopes Ministers may flatter themselves or attempt to delude their country we may be assured that where recruits provisions wood and iron are furnished by the country the rest of the instruments of war are easily procured No seaman will assert that powder cannot be conveyed  to the Colonies from abroad No naturalist will affirm that it cannot be made by them at home  This is the true state of our affairs this is the probability of success which it seems is to glorify administration and to make patriots shudder  Provided  that no misfortune happens to the army in America  provided  no foreign power interferes to assist the Provincials  provided  that the foreign powers in whom we trust will certainly assist usWith all these provisos it is possible that this nation may for one season morejust one morecontinue the expences of this desperate and ruinous contest  In the mean time the ministerial writers may manufacture paragraphs to amuse the people of England the Ministers may send out more porter to keep up the spirits of the disheartened troops at Boston the yet remaining wealth of England may be squandered in various ways for the purpose of hiding under lucrative contracts for war the hasty declension of trade they may buy or beg or cheat corporations into flattering addresses All these are but poor and temporary devices which may for a while veil from our eyes the real state of our affairs but are not of power to avert or soften the smallest part of the impending calamity Insensibility of danger and security from it are very different things  The African trade has felt the blow already The WestIndia trade staggers and is doomed to fall the next No trade can long stand the present unwise contest The loss of the American commerce is a lasting evil the substitute for it in the flush which the Russian peace and the Spanish armament have caused is contingent casual inadequate  The ministerial Manifesto from which I have quoted the above extraordinary passages speaks of it as of a circumstance of astonishing absurdity  "that an Englishman should look upon the TRIUMPH of the King's troops with regret"  Englishmen will tell Ministers what they think of such a triumph when they have the fortune to see it As yet that triumph has not been cause of joy or sorrow to any man alive  Do these men mock at our distress Do they really think that the precipitous retreat of the King's troops from Lexington was a triumph Do they think that the action at Bunker'shill where at the expence of more than half the number that fought these troops purchased a small enlargement of their burial ground was a triumph Do they imagine that it is a triumph of these poor halfstarved troops to have suffered from the day of that action as indeed they had  long before as close a blockade as any garrison can suffer in a place that is open to the sea  If these be the triumphs of the King's forces every public spirited every humane and honest mind beholds them with the deepest sorrow and regret There is no man worthy of bearing the name of Englishman who does not see with grief the miserable and disgraceful situation of the bravest troops and the best commanders in the world That man must be very indifferent to the glory of his country who does not see and feel too for the condition into which both have been brought by the most unexampled imbecility and rashness a condition which originating from plans laid in gross misinformation and fundamental error no courage in the troops and no skill in the commanders can possibly improve  Here for the present I am obliged to leave the troops and the  triumph  Ticonderoga Chambli St John's Montreal may be added to the list of these triumphs  I now turn to the gentlemen who fight under much more comfortable circumstances the battles of the Ministry in England It is not only in the paragraph I quote that they presume to insult those who differ from them in politics by charging them with a delight in the national calamities It is the constant language of these writers If any man has shewn a disposition  to such an unnatural delight whether he be a Minister or a Patriot the community must think such men deserving of a severer censure than any which the pens of such writers seem capable of inflicting  There are some indeed who if they do not delight in the national distresses seem at least not to entertain a proper horror of them These are they who in all political disputes are the constant favourers of violent measures who are continually urging the people to war and under the notion of meanness and pusillanimity decrying every idea of peace and reconciliation  These gentlemen may indeed feel some mortification not from generous sympathy but from disappointed pride when the natural however by them unexpected issue of their measures is strongly marked in circumstances of public calamity But these gentlemen ought to take care how they mistake in others for exultation at the national misfortunes those emotions of scorn and indignation which all men of sensibility must discover at the infatuated councils from whence our public misfortunes are derived  VALENS  LETTER II  ADDRESSES  Saturday September  Mr MILLER  THE manner in which administration is employed appears rather extraordinary in the present circumstances of the nation That period once so awful that day of account once so terrible to statesmen the  meeting of Parliament  is at hand It might be imagined that at such a time Ministry were exceedingly busy in fabricating for the satisfaction of the two Houses what they have hitherto thought proper to withhold from the publicsome sort of apology for the total failure of all their projects  It might be supposed they were continually occupied in a careful and detailed review of their former measures that by such a review they might discover to what mistake in the plan or to what weakness in the execution we were to ascribe the present calamitous situation of our  affairs One would think they were at length bending their attention on some scheme for preventing if possible the final dismemberment of the empire Instead of this they are wholly occupied in  the manufacture of addresses  To common observers this seems to be an odd entertainment for men in their condition If indeed addresses to Ministers could insure victories to armies if railing at enemies could repair defeats if flattery could cover disgraces if servility could give plenty to famine health to diseases and cure to wounds nothing could be more properly applied to the exigencies of Ministers and to the necessities of those who have the misfortune to bear arms in their support If addresses had this virtue these courtly performances would certainly merit all the care and expence which has been so profusely lavished in obtaining them  Although I think this proceeding of Ministry in many respects weak and trifling yet I confess that nothing  no not an address  exists in vain The managers are able to perceive among the first effects of this hopeful war into which they have betrayed their country an immense an immediate increase of the public burthens They see at length and they see only because they are forced to feel that they have drawn up the sluices of an expence which will not be in their power to let down at pleasure They persevere in their measures  because they wish to continue in their places They know that the measures necessary to their opulence must end in the beggary of their country When the purse and patience of the people are exhausted by the accumulated charges of an unnatural and disgraceful war it is then that the present manoeuvres are to take their effect The Ministry will put the people in mind that they suffer at their own  special request  They will  point to their addresses  and tell them  "TAXATION IS NO TYRANNY"  In one part of their project there is no doubt the Ministry will succeed They will get addresses enough None have ever missed who have ever sought them All the little agitators in boroughs will easily persuade men of much vanity and no reflection that their names to an address gives them a consequence at Court The little cunning bustling politicians in a corporation think they may with great safety exert themselves to oblige a particular friend that knows who and who are together and that when he pleases may see those who see the King If things go well they may plead merit if ill they are lost in the crowd and protected by their obscurity One of these snug Machiavels will reason thus  "We are in for it If the Minister chuses a war he will go to war whether we will or not If the taxes go on little places and little jobs as  well as great ones will increase We too if we play our cards well may come in for snacks whilst the whole burthen of the war without any alleviation will fall on the grumblers"  The  little  politician at the Town Hall is not altogether mistaken If his principal happens to think of him after the purpose is served he may be paid for his work but the  little politician  at the Cockpit will find himself miserably deluded When the national debt and national taxes begin to swell when trade sinks under its oppressions when Europe begins to be involved and the civil becomes but an introduction to a general war the Minister whoever he is will find that those who are willing to flatter are not able to protect him Those who are so ready to advise him to plunge his country into a war will not be in a capacity to furnish him with the means of carrying on that war nor with the expedient for extricating himself out of it  I believe there are very few of these signers or even of the original promoters of these addresses who have once given themselves the trouble to enquire whether this war of which they are so enamoured be absolutely necessary To ask themselves how it is to be supported To consider what end it is to answer if successful Or to reflect if it be unsuccessful what remedy is to be found in so dreadful a disaster  One circumstance methinks ought to make these gentlemen who halloo or who are hallooed to war a little cautious how they dip their hands in blood The Ministers have set out in their war with an avowed confession  that they are not able to carry it on with the strength of this country  They are at this instant suppliant at every Court in Europe There is not a country in which want and servitude have turned the lives of the subject into an object of traffick to the Prince in which Ministry are not mortgaging the revenue of England and plighting the faith of future Parliaments It is to HANOVERIAN to HESSIAN to RUSSIAN Arms that England is to owe the recovery and the preservation of our authority in America  Such arms are I admit the natural instruments for the establishment of arbitrary power But the addressers of such measures would do well to ask themselves to whom that arbitrary power is to belong if foreign force should prove successful To those by whom conquests are made the benefits of conquests will belong But I abhor the ideaHeaven forbid that slaves should ever become the masters of freemen or that Russian ferocity should triumph over English valour in any part of the world  The Ministry though they are compleatly disgraced in their principles for the attempt to terminate  British disputes by foreign arms may be further disgraced by their policy by their failure in that enterprise They have not yet been able to gratify their addressers with any certain assurance that they shall be permitted to transport over the Atlantic ocean Calmucks and Cossacks to lay waste with fire and sword the habitations of Englishmen and to turn one of the fairest part of the British dominions into one of their Tartarian desarts  They have not yet been able to succeed with regard to Russia but some German Princes have condescended to furnish them with the means of ruining their country by the mercenary aid of several regiments of Hessians Brunswickers Waldecks and Dessaus  Whoever advises others to war ought not only to be persuaded that the war is just but he ought to have a reasonable assurance that those to whom he applies himself are of ability to carry it on with success Otherwise he is not only sacrificing the interest of his country but he is disgracing and ruining the cause of justice itself Of the ability of the Ministers for this great task the addressers may have some private knowledge to which they trust But I must say their friends in power have not yet been pleased to favour the public whose approbation they court with any means of doing their capacity the honour that  perhaps it deserves Nothing has succeeded with them either in their civil provisions or in their military arrangements  They have made a great number of acts of parliament  Boston Port Act Massachusets Charter Act Military Execution Act Restraining fishery commonly called the Starvation Act The restraining intercourse Act c c  which has left the state of government in a thousand times a worse condition than they found it They followed their acts of parliament with above twenty of the best regiments in the service with almost the whole of the marines with such a strength of artillery and artillery companies as were never employed when we made war with France in America To give effect to this force they have sent no less than four Generals To the great land force they have added a great naval power The result of all these immense military arrangements has been that the Ministers have  one  town in Americafor their armies to starve and die inThis is the faithful abstract of the first year's history of our  new social war  These are plain matters of fact An honest man who sees no more than I can see of the probability of success in the course which has been hitherto pursued would therefore have his scruples about urging the same men to proceed in the same course  which has been hitherto so very unprosperous Have these flatterers any ground for confidence that the future proceedings of Ministers will be more fortunate than the past If they have it will be kind of them to open it a little to their expecting country One circumstance of incapacity in these Ministers is clear beyond all dispute they have known nothing of the difficulty of the business they were engaged in As the difficulty was not known it could not be provided for In consequence of this ignorance of the real state of America all the force that has hitherto been sent thither is lost We have all to begin anew as if nothing had been attempted England under their conduct exhausted before she has acted is obliged to rest all her hopes on the capricious alliance of a despotic Court and the perilous assistance of barbarian mercenary forces  It is for this assistance and for these forces that some deluded people are persuaded to address Our misfortunes are aggravated by a mortisying mixture of the ridiculous We have been brought it seems into this disgraceful situation of  foreign dependance  in order to maintain the  honour and dignity of Great Britain  Upon this topic of our  dignity  I may say something hereafter For the present I would seriously recommend it to my countrymen to consider  what never has been considered for them the difficulties of their proceeding in the course they have begun and at the same time the facility which appears for getting out of them  The way before us if we pursue the present course grows every step more and more perplexed The point at which we propose to rest recedes further and further from our view The way if we change our route is short and simple The single condition of peace proposed by America is  "  That we should put things on the footing they stood in  "  This is the proposition of the Congress and this surely is no harsh cruel or humiliating injunction We are desired to put ourselves and our colonies into that state in which from our happy union we were the envy of the world But the first terms proposed are not the last conclusive ones better may be obtained by  treaty  all may be lost  by violence  Have we then any rational ground of hope that by an obstinate war unskilfully carried on we shall be able to force from America more advantageous terms of peace than she offers at this moment Before any man sets his hand to an address he ought to have a satisfactory answer to the question I have put To abuse America and to talk of dignity is not an answer  VALENS  LETTER III  DIGNITY  Saturday October  Mr MILLER  IN this letter I intend to apply myself principally to those of my countrymen who are commonly distinguished by the name of the  Tory Party  There are many things in the doctrine and practice of that body which I never could perfectly approve A party whose distinguishing characteristic is a desire of exalting the prerogative of the Crown ought never to take the lead in a government constituted like ours But though I could not relish the doctrines of this political set I did not of course condemn the intentions of all who held them I did not I confess think the Tory party entirely well affected to the constitution Their own favourite phrase  "  The old constitution  "  which was and is continually in  their mouths seems to imply an invidious distinction and to intimate a dislike to the constitution as perfected or if they please new modelled at the Revolution But whatever their opinions of the constitution might be I thought them zealous according to their ideas for the interest and honour of their country In all things which distinguish this island from any other nation the exclusive and patriotic partiality of their affections has constantly broke out and sometimes not in the most decent and orderly manner that could be wished  It always appeared to me a circumstance rather singular that they whose principles were so much of foreign growth should far out go the Whigs themselves in the abhorrence of foreigners The great blessing derived from the Revolution could not make them forget that King William was a Dutchman They did not readily forgive even the founders of the fortune and greatness of his present Majesty that they were born in Hanover and were supposed to entertain sentiments of partial regard to their native country  In the principle of all this though sometimes carried too far and sometimes misapplied there was something respectable I remember perfectly well that when the Hessian troops were brought hither in the last reign this party complained very loudly  The imminent invasion of England at that time did not reconcile them to the measure of committing any part even of our most necessary defence to foreign forces Those foreign troops who were brought over for the purpose of quieting  the troubles in Scotland  for I mean to speak gently in the year did not meet from that party a more favourable reception Their unaffected dread of the prevalence of the House of Stuart in that critical contest could not make them permit a momentary departure from their ancient maxims Their preservation from the greatest of all calamaties a subjection to an irritated a revengeful a bigotted even a foreign master a master who founded his right upon the supposed nullity of every right in his subjects could not excuse this obnoxious mode of safety  It was in vain alledged in mitigation of that measure that the national troops were engaged abroad that we had no time to get together and to discipline a body of English that our foreign enemies had interfered that some forces in the French service were actually in Scotland and the arrival of more was daily apprehended This was all urged to inattentive ears The Tories still exclaimed that the troops of our allies brought hither on that occasion were  foreigners  and nothing but the consideration that a late capitulation  had bound them not to be of any use could induce the Tory party to bear the presence of such guests with any reasonable patience  Sudden emergencies may make the departure from the most wise and settled principles justifiable by the evident necessity of the case But certainly the general principle  of keeping foreign powers from interfering in national disputes  is founded in the truest wisdom and soundest policy There is not only no dignity but no safety in a different conduct I was therefore a good deal surprised when I found so many of the Tories not only tolerating but rejoicing in the attempts made by Ministers for engaging large bodies of foreigners to act in the  present civil war  To what are we to attribute this extraordinary change which that party has made in the only part of their sentiments in which they were perfectly justifiable Instead of murmurs complaints and remonstrances we see the persons most warm in that cause almost every where active and bustling to procure addresses of compliment in order to give the Ministers all kind of credit and support in their negociations for  foreign troops  In all this I see no sort of attention to the honour of this country The first principle of dignity is  independence  A government in profound  peace with all its neighbours which is not able without external assistance to enforce obedience from its own subjects is in effect annihilated The powers on whom such a phantom of authority depends are the true and real government The other is only a vassal If we cannot govern it but by the forces of Russia and Hanover Hanover and Russia are not only the  Rulers of America  but they are the  Masters of England  There must be some extraordinary weakness in Administration some disinclination to the service in the gross of the people something unusually colourable in the resistance that at the very  outset of the quarrel  has disabled the strongest power in the world Our Ministers stumble at the threshold they are out of wind before they have run the first heat The first year of this war in America they implore foreign nations to bring them out of that struggle which a little while ago they told us might be ended by a very few of the superfluous regiments which a  prodigal peace establishment  wantonly kept up for parade and shewSuch is the dignity of England in the hands of its present trustees  If we cannot end our own quarrels by our own wisdom or our own power they will never be ended Foreigners very rarely if ever interfere  with cordial purposes to the benefit of the party which calls them in It will be their business like lawyers to prolong the suit in order to exhaust the litigants  Whilst the quarrel continues foreign powers know that you must comply with every demand and submit to every insult The old enemies of the kingdom will be sure to fan the flames of dissention The very best affected of the foreign Courts will make themselves necessary as long as they can They will assist you just enough to  continue  the dispute but not to end it because that dispute and their superiority must have exactly the same duration  Rather than consent to be thus at the mercy of foreigners Dignity if she would condescend to take commonsense into her councils would think that the cruel alternative proposed by the American Congress  "of returning to the situation in which we stood in "  ought to be accepted If English Dignity is to be compromised I had rather settle amicably with America than be obliged to too polite a submission to the House of Bourbon I should consent rather to bear the Roughness of English Liberty than subject myself to foreign Pride and barbarian Insolence I had rather shake Hancock and  Adams by the hand than cool my heels in the antichamber of Orloff and Potemkin  I fear I ought to apologize for a sentiment so opposite to the notions adopted by the Minister and all his friends When the British flag was insulted by the Spaniards in taking off the rudder from an English Man of War our unimpassioned Minister saw with his eyes broad open all the dangers and horrors of a War The condition of our finances made him tremble at the expences to be brought on by a contest with Spain No principle of dignity retarded the establishment of peace on the  first  opening that  could  be found But a free people struggling for the preservation of the  principle  on which our Constitution is founded must not be heard Their very petitions must not be received until  they are at our feet  The horrors of war more shocking as being a Civil war and an expence far more destructive as being  on both sides  out of the bowels of the British substance is to be chearfully borne rather than submit to the  Indignity  of a  Reconciliation  with our fellow Citizens  VALENS  LETTER IV  THE CAMPAIGN  Saturday October  Mr MILLER  THE proper answer to an address for war is a tax There can be no doubt but that such an answer will be returned fairly and speedily and without a shadow of equivocation In this point at least the Ministers are capable of giving perfect satisfaction to their admirers To  exhaust the sinking fund  to  accumulate debt  to  raise the land tax  to put an  additional duty on malt  and on  malt liquors  and  to revive the home excise upon cyder  these are things within the power of the most common financier The ways of taking the public money or of spending it when taken are tolerably obvious There is nothing required for these purposes but patience on the part of the people And Administration has had for some time past comfortable  assurances that the good people of England possess a sufficient share of that steady and useful though not very shining virtue  The Addressers with an honest eagerness and anxiety ask for war and they offer their fortunes They need be under no sort of uneasiness The one will be given and the other will be taken and as far as I can discover from the courtly language of the Gazette this is what is desired and all that is desired in the many dutiful and loyal addresses with which that instructive paper has lately swelled so much beyond its usual dimensions  In former times when the evil habits of faction had rendered men importunate and difficult a little more than this would have been looked for People would have been desirous of some account of the ends and purposes for which the public money had been expended of the manner in which the war had been conducted of the future prospect of success from the arrangements already made or which were in apparent forwardness If they received no satisfaction in these points war would in those times have been thought very little more desirable than peace Success victory glory national reputation national power were the circumstances that formerly made war and the train of war tolerable  to a nation The probability of a favourable event and the beneficial consequences of victory when attained were always more or less in contemplation At present the fashionable taste seems to be for  efforts  without  vigour expence  without  return preparation  without  action  and  war  without an  object  I will not say whether I have been well or ill employed but abounding in leisure as you will easily believe I have read over all the public performances of the friends of Ministry Not one I imagine has escaped me The coffee house I frequent is well supplied with the papers The papers are no less liberally supplied with political essays and paragraphs on the ministerial side of the question At no time have Ministers more carefully attended to this mode of communication with the public and they have spared no expence nor trouble to engage diligent and industrious writers in their cause  One circumstance has struck me as very singular In all the course of this extensive and various reading I never once observed a letter or even one single paragraph so much as insinuating that  "the war with America had been hitherto conducted with common sense"  If my recollection has failed me some person of more retentive  memory or more accurate observation will be so good as to supply my defects  Notwithstanding this trifling omission the Ministers I must admit have not been wholly wanting to themselves They have carried on a notable war with the  MileEnd Assembly  They have fought a very strenuous battle with  Mr Mascall  In my opinion they have gained a compleat victory over him They have laid  Mr Joel  on his back  Atkinson Bush  must be a bold man if he ventures to shew his faceFor all these advantages I give them full credit But still the  proscribed Hancock  sits at the head of  The United Colonies  and  Putnam the carpenter  besieges and starves twelve thousand British troops with four of the best English Generals at their head  This was written in October Three winter months have not we may believe mended the situation of those gallant men wantonly made the victims of ministerial infatuation  I have concealed nothing which has happened in favour of our great statesman The above is a short but fair and impartial account of the advantages obtained and the losses suffered by the ministerial arms of all sorts at home and abroad during the glorious campaign of  At what a price all this glory has been acquired we shall not immediately know though our inquisitive Parliament is so shortly to meet Some part of the burthen we shall feel very soon But the whole charge certainly will not be then displayed lest it should throw some damp on the spirit of addressing which at present seems the grand resource of the nation There will undoubtedly be a large and constant demand on this fund of national politeness and it will as largely and constantly answer the drafts at sight Whatever may become of others there is no danger that  this Bank  should ever be obliged to stop payment  The vein of addressing in a situation like the present is a phaenomenon rather unusual in the political world though in the moral it is highly commendable The compliments paid to defeat and misfortune are the effect of true generosity If the thing went no further all might be well But it grows serious when a compliment conveys a trust To this hour the want of success was always deemed a presumption of the want of wisdom It went beyond a  presumption  if the ill success had attended upon great forces Men grew out of humour and became unwilling to commit their lives and fortunes to the care of those in whose hands they found that nothing prospered  If they thought a war eligible this became a strong motive against confiding to the unfortunate in that precise situation in which of all others Fortune has the greatest share They would not say  "we ought to go to war with America therefore make a complimentary address to those who have  lost  that country We ought to use  force  therefore support those under whose direction  power  has sunk into  impotence  "  The period for these congratulatory addresses and this solemn approbation of ministerial conduct is well chosen and strongly marked It surely deserves to be as much distinguished as an  Aera  in the Chronicles of Great Britain as any event that has happened since the foundation of this monarchy The Aera of THE EVACUATION OF BOSTON The compliments arrive precisely in the great important moment  when the British troops are compelled to quit the last British town in America From this period we are I suppose to begin the reckoning of a new golden age of commerce liberty and empire  VALENS  LETTER V  OBJECT OF THE WAR  Saturday October  MR MILLER  I Remember Mr  Hume  somewhere in his history observes that amidst all the calamities of the great civil war between Charles the First and his people the English enjoyed this singular good fortune that  no foreign nation interfered in their quarrels  Mr  Hume  is in the right The circumstance was fortunate and I am afraid it will continue to be singular The present melancholy civil war is of another kind and is to be carried on as it was begun upon very different principles It is a war in which as  foreigners  have the sole interest none but  foreigners  will finally decide In the great civil war between Charles the First and the national Representative both parties had in view such an object as usually passes for rational  Had Charles the First actually subdued his Parliament he might possibly have levied taxes without the consent of those who were to pay them He would then have been to England what England claims to be to America the sole virtual Representative of his people Their consent would have been involved in his will To resist would be to rebel So far the politics of Charles the First and ours go on together but there is a slight circumstance in which they differ  If he had carried his point his power would have led to profit The kingdom which he would have reduced lay under his eye and all its concerns were within his grasp By a common revenue establishment and a moderate standing army there was no doubt but that he might easily have drawn into his own coffers as much of the property of his subjects as would have supported that establishment and paid that army and left a surplus besides for the purposes of avarice ambition or dissipation The nation had the same interest to defend which the King had to attack Here was a war that had an object Prince and people strongly interested they wanted no intervention of foreigners to decide their quarrel  But if Charles the First had involved himself in all his difficulties in order to tax without their consent a people who were miles by sea distant from himif the people at that distance were scattered over a Wilderness miles in length and in breadthif their extended sea cost was pervious by a thousand havens bays and creeks to every fraud and every elusion of dutiesif these duties by the best collection far from being able to support a vast standing army a powerful navy and numerous fortifications would consessedly not suffice for the maintenance of a tenth part of a competent Revenue establishmentif such had been the attempts of Charles the First nothing but the consideration of his insanity could have drawn the least degree of pity upon his misfortunes The great subject of curiosity would be how he came to find any abettors in so frantic an attempt It would have been but natural for him to seek his instruments in every country but his own as those people would be the most fit to fight his battles who were the least acquainted with his cause  Charles besides the obvious lucrative advantage which he possessed had another apology for his arbitrary undertakings and Mr Hume is too skilful an advocate to let it pass His people  were far from liberal in their supplies They frequently even refused any subsidy to his greatest wants What an aggravation would it have been of his misconduct if all the world had known and if he himself had confessed on record that the grants of his people had outgone his  requisitions  and that their  supplies  while voluntary had far exceeded their  abilities  Join then together the two suppositions which I have made and let every candid man form a judgment on the wisdom of that sovereign power call it King or Parliament or by what name you please which could wage a destructive war for an object of taxation impossible to be attained in order to avoid having recourse to a quiet mode of application which had never failed  It is in our power obstinately to shut our eyes to the genuine appearances of things If we please we may stop our ears against reason or we may prevent the voice of truth from being heard by the din of our own passionate talking But still reason and truth will one way or other have their operation and though not seen or heard they will cause themselves to be felt They are at this minute in full energy and are now though not so sensibly in the mode as in the effects acting with irresistible power While Parliament votes and Corporations address  a general torpor and deadness have benumbed the whole community The state is paralytic We have nothing left alive but that miserable and feeble voice with which we sue for compassion to the enemies of our former greatness and call upon foreign nations to obtain for us some sort of authority among our own people  England feels she has no interest in this quarrel The army cannot be recruited to any tolerable degree of strength much less to a force adequate to the necessities of the present bloody service It is because the yet uncorrupted body of the people of England are brave and generous that they do not chuse to shed their blood in this quarrel All the ink that has been or ever can be shed in addresses will not persuade them to join with  German vassals  and  Russian slaves  in exterminating the little remnant of freedom which still continues to bless the world  Unsupported by English arms the Ministers fly to Scotland The gallant and sagacious people of that country worthy to be for ever in sentiments as in government one with England have declined to employ their valour for the destruction of their sole asylum from despotism and opprssioen They will not chuse to pass from praedial to military servitude They  will not suffer themselves to be turned into merchandize for the profit of those men who are bartering for lucrative places and for regiments the lives that are not yet sacrificed to their avarice as landlords  The Author confesses himself somewhat mistaken with regard to the  Parliament  of Ireland and the  people  of Scotland  The Scotch are indeed going to America but they are going as settlers not as soldiers An illegal order has been issued to compel them by force to continue in the house of bondage and to keep them from tasting the fertility and freedom of America  The application to Ireland has been as unsuccessful as it was indecent Did they imagine that generous people to be such an herd of blunderers as to spill their blood in order to enable Ministers to tax without their consent all the countries subject to this crown The Irish Roman Catholics feel as the Protestants do They also know America as an Asylum None but a very few vagabonds have been captivated by the half guinea liberality of the Earl of Kenmore or the military rhetoric of Major Boyle Roche  English Scotch Irish failing Canada French and Popish has been applied to as the last resource among British subjects Canada French and Popish have refused Laws have been suspended and military despotism proclaimed in  The Canadians have heard the sound of liberty  The Ministry thus disowned not in words but in practice by every old and every new subject of this empire are obliged to go about begging at the door of every petty Court and every venal State of Germany They have prostrated English dignity before Russian despotism They are satisfied to sneak like servile Gentlemen Ushers before the  State  of the French Ambassador while all Europe looks with derision at their aukward secondhand airs and their imitated grimaces of exotic complaisance They stoop their stiff backs to kiss the baffled hands of Spain Our heroic Ministers tremble before  the fugitives from Algiers  Sir Joseph Yorke under their direction is employed in a manner that is certainly odious to so liberal a mind as his and indeed must be so to any man who has served his country in better times He is alert and active and watches day and night But he watches not the Councils but the Ports of Holland He is obliged to thrust his nose into the hatchway of every Dutch Dogger and to rummage and cross examine every paltry Package The Ambassador Extraordinary of England is sunk into an attentive Tidewaiter But all this expence of honour has purchased scarce any sort of advantage Their  negociations and their searches have been as unsuccessful and as impotent as their arms All they can as yet do is to deliver over Gibraltar and Minorca to Hanoverians But though they have failed in procuring other nations to destroy our Colonies our Colonies may imitate their example in calling  It does not appear that the Colonies have as yet made any attempt to call in foreign succours That humiliating glory has been left to the haughty superior We hear that we have lately had some appearance of success in clearing the jails and hospitals of Germany much to the relief of those countries whatever it may be to ours The Hessian and Brunswick reinforcements are for the greater part raw and new levies A specimen of them of about three hundred has been lately exhibited on the shore of Kent If this complication of misery and villainy can be manufactured into an army by the skill and authority of a German Prince yet will Lord G Germaine be quite positive that an adventurous ambitious General of that stamp with men under his command will indure the inconveniences of such a siege as our own troops have sustained Would not the just complaints that General Carleton makes of being left unprovided with the supplies he expected arise to something worse than complaints from a foreign Prince Might not such a man so treated think himself justified to resent as well as complain Is it impossible that he might quit the party that did not support him in the manner stipulated Is it impossible that a German Prince might find a territory as large and a revenue as great as what he left in Germany These are hints the consideration of these things may not be unworthy of the  wisest heads  among them  in foreign aid and as with  a more decent excuse so in all human probability with better success  In this unparalelled state of distress and degradation of their country the Ministers are not without their comforts They hold their places they enjoy their salaries they receive their addresses At present they are in high spirits They are persuaded that their pay and disgrace may be continued a  year  longer They will again hold out delusive ideas of peace upon terms which they know are not admissible trusting that the deceit of the session will hold out until the recess as to the rest they tell us that all is now perfectly right that the Savages of the desart have undertaken the government of the British Colonies They inform us that they intend to change their mode of making war They have it seems by some means or other at length found out that to be besieged is not the way to conquer They propose to ravage what they are not capable of governing and abandoning all idea of being conquerors and legislators they are in hopes of becoming successful Pirates  VALENS  LETTER VI  THE PLOT  Thursday November  Mr MILLER  ON Monday the d of October in the morning Mr Sayre Banker in Oxford Road was seized by King's Messengers upon an accusation of nothing less than an horrid and detestable enterprize against the  personal Liberty  of our Sovereign In the evening of that day he was committed to the Tower by a warrant for  treasonable practices  On the th the London Gazette announced to the world that he was committed for  High Treason  On the th all his friends and even his counsel were refused admittance to him On the th he was carried before Lord Mansfieldand without the least hesitation doubt or delay he was admitted to bail upon  l for each of his two securities and l for himself  This is an exact though short chronological History of the  Banker's  Plot one of the grand events which amidst the splendor of so many illustrious actions in peace and war among so many laws wisely planned and firmly executed will in future times distinguish the memorable period of the present administration The nature of the offence for which Mr Sayre was committed to the Tower and guarded with such unusual strictness and severity or the validity of the charge or the legality or justice of the proceeding will be estimated from the extraordinary bail which has been accepted on the Habeas Corpus of this eminent State Criminal  It is known that no bail can be admitted to an accusation of High Treason laid upon any tolerable ground I do not mean exactly to limit the power of the Chief Justice of England on these occasions but it is universally known that such is the general nature of the offence The security in the present case amounts in effect to no bail at all The culprit himself his partner and his attorney are the persons bound and they are not all three bound in a sum amounting to more than a  thousand pound  It is this  special  bail which forms at this moment the indissoluble texture of the triple cord of public security It is at this price that the most  desperate of traitors if we believe the Minister has purchased the means of escaping from the punishment of the past or of ensuring the perpetration of his future crimes  I believe there is no man under a serious charge of High Treason who would not readily redeem his life at the price of one thousand pounds There is no man daring enough to conceive such a Treason to whom the fear of losing a thousand pounds would prove any restraint in his black designs We all remember the clamour that was raised against Lord Mansfield for admitting to bail upon a sum nearly as considerable as this a man who was accused of  stealing a few quires of paper  No faction has as yet gone such lengths in this case or been impudent enough to accuse that great Magistrate of illegality or partiality in taking such bail for a person who stood charged with an attempt to  steal the King  Attempts which in private cases would be but misdemeanors or sometimes no definite offence at all change their nature in cases which relate to the King's person and become crimes of the greatest magnitude as they certainly are of the blackest die Some time ago the depriving a few  Printers Devils  of their liberty for a short time was estimated at an higher sum than an  attempt to take away the liberty of our Sovereign and with it of course the liberty as well as the happiness of all his people It could not be that Lord Mansfield whose affection to his Majesty cannot be disputed did not value his gracious Sovereign benefactor and friend at more than one thousand pound This estimation would fall below all precedents in similar cases the value of money in different times and countries considered It was not therefore the crime but the charge and the process that were treated with such just contempt by a firm enlightened and constitutional Chief Justice Our guardian angel of the laws did but touch this diabolical plot with the spear of his pointed sagacity when instantly it started up in its own proper shape and moved the derision of the world  Here we must commend the Chief Justice No man ever spoke more constitutional language or ever acted in a more constitutional manner But when we have said this of Lord Mansfield there end all the commendations that we can bestow upon the servants of the crown It does not appear why they should at all have taken up Mr Sayre much less why they should have committed him  close prisoner  to the Tower upon grounds which at the very first view a man of sense and knowledge perceived to be so contemptible It  does not appear upon what grounds a Minister of State chose to order so close and rigorous a confinement for a matter which the head of the law considered as meriting in effect no confine ment at all  The senses of our Ministers were so compleatly taken away I suppose by the horror of so dreadful a plot that they did not know for what particular matter it was that they had chosen to commit this desperate and formidable conspirator The warrant for  taking  Mr Sayre is for  High Treason  the warrant for his  commitment  is for  Treasonable Practices  but when they come to inform the public of their proceedings thro' the Gazette they return to their old ground and tell us they have committed him upon a charge of  High Treason  What could be the reason of all this confusion contradiction and prevarication Their excuse on this affair as on the affairs of America and indeed on most others is their want of knowledge on the subject  Candour calls on me to admit that a Secretary of State who has or assumes the power of acting as a Magistrate is not therefore obliged or supposed to have in himself any knowledge of  law  or of his own  duty  in that situation or indeed any knowledge of those rules of  prudence  with which men who have no authority to support  them in their errors are obliged to regulate their conduct What I lament in men of their excellent dispositions and what they will join me in lamenting is that they have  no power  The King's Privy Council was not able to cammand the attendance of any of the great Law Officers of the Crown The Chief Justice  would  not be present The Attorney General no one suspects it was through fear declined attendance It is said that Mr Wedderburne was the law director on this occasion But until Mr Wedderburne avows this folly it is not handsome and I fear it might possibly be actionable to charge a gentleman of a learned profession with any share in so  unbookish  Vide Shakespear's Othello  a proceeding  One might have imagined that the master of the  Thieftakers  whom with that propriety which distinguishes all their conduct they thought proper to assume as their assessor and on whom the safety of the King and kingdom and the execution of their most important laws were rested in such a critical moment he one would imagine might have acquired in  his  extensive practices a little more knowledge of business But it is possible that this great magistrate like some other great men on great occasions was  called to Council only for form to give the sanction of his important presence to this very grave proceeding His advice was most probably not taken though his figure was exhibited The Ministers very naturally meant to cover themselves by the name and authority of Sir John Fielding  They wisely considered that the eyes not only of England and America but of all Europe were upon them They therefore chose to bestow upon this transaction a degree of public solemnity equal to its intrinsic value To accomplish this intention the Propertyman of the Court Theartre had orders to fill a part in this splendid  spectacle  with our blind seer the sage  Tiresias  of the British Nation The whole  corps diplomatique  was infinitely edified The foreign Ministers now look with admiration an admiration for the first time wholly unmixed with envy on the profound wisdom astonishing resources and incredible success of our Statesmen in all their concerns from the evacuation of Boston to the discharge of Mr Sayre  We are yet to see the second part of this business opened and to behold Mr Sayre in the character of a prosecutor not a culprit of an assailant not a defender We shall see him like his brethren of Boston besieging that Minister  who had blocked up his shop Here the case will be greatly altered and such contemptible bail will not I apprehend be taken in the action which Mr Sayre will probably bring against the Secretary of State for having seized and committed a man in trade upon such frivolous grounds and by such an illegal method of proceeding The King's Exchequer must support the credit of Mr Sayre's Bank There will be new reason to call upon this goodnatured Parliament to pay the debts of his Majesty's Civil List incurred by the want of knowledge precipitancy and shallow politics of his Ministers  This will now become a regular head and settled charge in the account of the Treasurer of the Chamber     l s d  Blunders of his Majesty's Ministers     It is no trivial sum which has hitherto filled up or which will hereafter fill the above blank The charge is certain and infallible and must be provided for though like the Navy Debt and the extraordinaries of the army it cannot be brought into estimate There must be some unknown but important and singular advantage to a nation in being governed by foolish Ministers since  people are content to pay so dearly for that benefit  This sham plot appears at first view to have been a miserable and ludicrous affair from the beginning to the end Yet however conducted I do not think it was wholly devoid of a  certain sort of policy  in the original scheme It might answer a present purpose and at a critical moment Its operation lasted as long as political plots are necessary to hold Like  MoorGame  brought from the North the  haut gout  and  fumette  recommend it for a day the next it stinks  The Ministers opened the session under a few small disadvantages Among other items of charge they were under some slight apprehensions that they might possibly be called to some account for the  loss of an empire  They felt themselves in danger They were obliged like those they sent to other disagreeable services to fortify themselves on the  Neck  The addresses were their intrenchments the plot was the mine and thus well secured in front they did not fear the unpaid body of  RifleMen  who were charged and ready to let fly at them  The bringing down his Majesty to his Parliament under a  double  guard and with a double  proportion of the mob of constables  It is remarkable that Ministers as if in scorn of their own plot sent the King to his Parliament with this extraordinary parade of guards  while the conspirator was safely locked up in the Tower  but ever since he has been discharged and at  liberty  to make any attempts the attendance on the King has been remarkably trifling  and trading Justices in order to guard that guard was on the whole a manoeuvre not ill calculated to inspire panic terrors and rob the poor multitude of their little remaining stock of common sense  The Ministry were sensible of the zeal and affection of the people to their Prince They hoped that the danger of the state might be forgotten in the supposed danger of the Soverign They hoped that our anxiety for his Majesty's safety might suspend our resentment for the loss of his empire and that in this general dismay and confusion nobody would enquire into the merits of that invaluable speech which had escaped to the sanctuary of Parliament through so many surrounding perils  This ludicrous proceeding has a serious moral Ministers ought not to trifle with the safety of their master They ought not to presume to make that sacred object the plaything of their paltry politics They ought to be as far from encouraging a manifestly corrupt or an evidently  trivial charge as from neglecting a grave and weighty information The levity or low cunning which tempts them to such petty arts have effects that may be fatal They tend to lessen that horror which used to attend a charge of High Treason By false alarms they prepare the way for real dangers They encourage conspiracies by weakening the public belief in them That man is not without a large share of the guilt of any future wicked enterprize who with sham plots and childish stories amuses the public credulity always prone to believe too much or too little  I trust that the spirit now rising in Parliament will animate honest men to an enquiry into the affair without being diverted from their other important enquiries They will know how Ministers come to sport with High Treason whilst impeachments are hanging over their own heads They will ask how they came to deceive into the support of their ruinous measures men in the highest offices and the most entitled to a faithful communication They will ask why they betrayed private trust as well as public confidence They will ask the Ministers why in the last year they demanded an implicit reliance from their extensive knowledge and this year argue their innocence from their ignorance They will call for an account of the treasures  the arms the commerce the reputation the dominion of their country which have been foolishly squandered feebly employed wantonly sacrificed shamefully tarnished lamentably lost When these questions receive the only answers they can receive and these answers the only reply they deserve then may there be some hopes of salvation for this country  VALENS  POSTCRIPT  I really do not conceive an object more worthy of a manly and respectful compassion than a great mind sacrificing its dearest interest and risking even total ruin upon a principle of dignity But before a man becomes a martyr to any opinion he ought to be supposed to have some notion of the merits of the cause in which he gives so painful a proof of his sincerity If we had not had ten years war with Mr Wilkes begun on the principles and ended in the manner in which that ever memorable  war was begun and ended before our eyes we might be at a loss to conceive what ideas of dignity our Ministers had conceived I believe it is generally remembered that that noble and successful struggle was made entirely for dignity Our American war was also undertaken for dignity All the world sees with what dignity it is conducted All the world sees the dignity which was so uniformly sustained in the Tragicomedy of  "Majesty preserved or the Sayre Plot discovered"  The rule of the drama was there intirely well observed  servetur ad imum  Qualis ab incepto processerit et sibi constet  never was known a proceeding so perfectly consistent with itself and with every other proceeding of it's authors  The court Gazette at the opening of Parliament announces to all Europe a design of seizing the King in his capital in the most frequented street of that capital surrounded by his guards and in the very act of his solemn meeting of his nobles and his people Since the grand Gunpowder Treason we have not heard of a more desperate conspiracy Does any man out of the ministry imagine that the personal honour of the King that the glory of our nation in a word that British dignity was enhanced by this public  avowal of so daring an attempt on the sacred person of a King without using any means to punish the criminal to guard against his farther attempts or to prevent the terrible effects of such a glaring example of wickedness and impunity  The reputation for courage and wisdom has hitherto been considered as the only source of dignity If the danger from this conspiracy was contemptible it was a poor display of courage to manifest so great an alarm upon it If deep and serious it shewed a deplorable want of wisdom in doing nothing whatever in consequence of it  I am not speaking of the honesty and justice of that measure toward the subject Of this Ministers may hear at another season I confine myself solely to the manner in which they consulted the  dignity  of their Sovereign and his reputation amongst the other Crowned Heads of Europe Instead of an Object of awe and respect he is at best held out as an object of compassion when with all his virtues he could not be preserved from such attempts and with all the aid of his laws and all the supplementary authority of his Parliament he was not able to punish them  Ministers have no way to save themselves from these imputations but by admitting that they did not themselves believe one word of that plot which they announced to the world with so much  parade Had they believed it they would they must have brought it before Parliament It was their duty so to do That I confess is not so strong a proof that they would have done so But it was their interest to have done it and in the course of things if they had known matter that carried even a grave appearance they certainly would have laid it before Parliament But they have never opened their lips in either House upon the subject Even their well trained majority was not to be trusted with disgracing themselves by the adoption of so foolish and so foul a scheme  One  act of public disgrace is merely ministerial and has not been communicated with Parliament  If they have been silent in Parliament have they opened their mouths in the Courts of Justice were this daring attempt if it ever had birth ought to have been pursued to the death of the bold and bad contrivers So far from pursuing Mr Sayre in a Court of Justice they were not to be provoked to a word of justification of their conduct when Mr Sayre brought them there by claiming his right of standing in his country like other innocent men free from charge and free from bail  These abortive plots tend to disgrace the Crown the Law and the Magistrates of England with other states They tend to render the King  jealous of his people In whatever light they are viewed they are at once ridiculous and alarming  But our worthy representatives have looked on with perfect indifference To them the wisdom or the folly the reality or the falsity of the plot the danger of the King or of the subject the base neglect of the ministry in dropping or the scandalous diligence in beginning the prosecution the honour of the national wisdom or the national justice these are matters in which they have no concern This is an improvement in the fashionable  nonchalance  and inattention in modern good breeding One would have imagined that common civility should have induced a Parliament so versed in polite address to make some enquiry how his Majesty had rested after such an attempt The circumstance of the attempt being made on a visit to them might have called upon them for some sort of notice But times as well as countries have their customs  LETTER VII  TENURE OF OFFICE  Saturday November  MR MILLER  THE Duke of Grafton has been removed from the Office of Privy Seal The mere removal of a Minister is a matter of little moment to the people But the cause of his removal may be of the highest importance as it is frequently the surest and strongest indication of the system of politics which predominates at Court  The offence given by the Duke of Grafton is known to all the world A person of the highest rank in the kingdom in an office of the highest rank in the State very lately first Minister of State in great personal favour with his Majesty closely connected by the strongest ties of affinity inclination and interest with a leading part of the administration and a constant and powerful supporter of their measuresThis man finding  the British empire in America lost by the measures he had implicitly supported at last presumes to desire some little information in this perilous state of our affairs He is immediately dismissed from his employment with every possible mark of displeasure and disgrace  The favourers of Administration are now acquainted with the terms upon which they are to support government A great deal of the support not only of wellwishers within doors but even of the Members of both Houses of Parliament must be implicit Many matters of detail undoubtedly cannot some matters certainly ought not to be communicated The advantage of having men of great rank and interest in their country in high station is this and perhaps this only we suppose they have a spirit proportioned to their station that they look for something else in office besides the salary that they are entitled to information and explanation that  they  at least are depositaries of the real secret On this presumption the support of such great persons becomes a pledge to the public that the steps taken by the directing part of Ministry are taken upon proper ground When the people at large have reason to believe this to be the case they are apt patiently to acquiesce in the ruling wisdom  Their confidence subsists unshaken even among difficulties which embarass their affairs and doubts that perplex their understanding  It has been now for the first time thought proper to remove the veil that was drawn between the people and the government We are now informed that the support of the greatest men in the kingdom and in the highest offices is to be as blind and uninformed as that of CustomHouse Officer who by order of the Treasury votes at an election for a Nabob  Ignorant credulity passive submission blind obedience are the virtues which politicians have hitherto required and sometimes foundin the mob Until our happy days these laudable dispositions have not been thought qualifications for the highest offices in a great empire At present it is not enough to impose upon the people The purpose for which one half of the Ministry subsists is to impose upon the other half By this happy invention it is that a Ministry composed of jarring principles and adverse opinions is to be rendered unanimous  A sort of frauds I admit have been often practised in matters of state The public danger has been often represented much beyond the reality in order that the fullest preparations might be made against it because superfluous comprehends  necessary exertion and it is better to be a good deal beyond than the least degree short of security But this is the first time that real difficulties were concealed in order that weak arrangements should be justified or that feeble arrangements were avowedly chosen in order to hide a danger of the first magnitude In former times whatever little artifices were used were external Till now systematical internal delusion and mutual impositions of Ministers have not been openly professed as maxims of government  The House of Lords presented the other day a scene as instructive as it was singular An altercation had arisen on the state of the navy It was thought extraordinary last year when the reduction of America by force was resolved on that the naval establishment should be reduced from to seamen It was then thought something unaccountable that operations of violence should be commenced by a reduction of strength At that time however the first Lord of the Admiralty in the first assembly of the nation solemnly declared that that he  knew  the establishment as then voted at men to be sufficient for all its purposes This year the same person in the same office in the same assembly has declared that he last year  knew  it to be  not  sufficient  The species of courage and magnanimity which supports a man in such a declaration excited no surprise The character of that truly noble person is perfectly and universally understood It was the  reason  he assigned for the last year's imposition that struck every man who heard it He was obliged he said to make that representation to the House because if he had laid open the real extent and necessities of the service in which the naval power was to be employed he  "should not have been supported by Lords in high office"  The reason assigned for this gross imposition on the hereditary council of the Crown who agreed to that establishment on the Commons who voted it and on the nation which acquiesced in it is in effect  "that if the first Lord of the Admiralty had not deceived the public he could not have been happy enough to deceive his colleagues"  To seduce us into a war it must carry the appearance of peace Our danger must be concealed lest we should keep out of it or prepare against it A civil war is in itself so desirable to Ministers that we must run into it without either knowledge or preparation This pious and prudent war was to please like virtue for its own sake and to be recommended even by the miseries which were to attend it We must resolve to cut the throats of  the Americans even though our own defeat even though famine blockade loss of reputation and loss of empire should be the inevitable consequence These disasters were to become the pledge of our perseverance in this glorious design When we should have suffered enough of shame and enough of damage in the first feeble effort it was presumed we should grow sufficiently irritated not with our advisers but our enemies to continue in those hostilities which with information we never could have commenced that having been brought into difficulties by ignorance we should plunge deeper by passion that feeling we had suffered by weak exertions we might be reconciled to the strongest that disgusted with the ill effects of moderate expences we might set all on one desperate cast in the wild imagination that with a boundless charge we might either retrieve our error or compleat our ruin A timid and treacherous beginning a bold and desperate progress a conclusion to be apprehended in the silence of horror not to be expressed in words  Avowing this scheme some of the Ministers have confessed that they had been deceivers most that they had been deceived Those who are not content to be deceivers or deceived any  longer are not any longer to be Ministers This is now declared to be the tenure of British administration  One would think that country gentlemen had too much of plain honesty and plain sense after so public a manifestation of imposture delusion and ignorance to act their part any longer in this tragical farce Implicit confidence in confessed imposture seems rather too much Justice must be done to many of the country gentlemen Steady supporters of government they did not mean to be abettors of a faction When they heard Ministers confess that the facts were mistaken and the reasonings erroneous on which the plans of government had been formed for several years past they thought themselves obliged to look a little more carefully about them The public misfortunes had taught them to presume less and to examine more They thought they had a right after so many promises broken and so many expectations disappointed to demand more explicit information  They observed that the person called the Minister on the first day of the session was totally undecided concerning the part that he was to act The second day they heard or thought they heard him declare that he would readily abandon  taxation repeal the obnoxious acts and reduce things to the condition of A day or two after they heard him explain himself to have meant nothing like it The succeeding day he explained away his explanation One day concession was to set all to rights the next all depended on force Sometimes a revenue was to be the true object of the war Sometimes an American revenue was the wildest project in the world Sometimes the Americans aimed at independency and nothing less could satisfy them Sometimes it was against nature that they should suffer all the evils of war rather than not accept of reasonable conditions Sometimes concessions on our part were to precede an armistice sometimes the submission of the rebels was to precede all treaty No two men in office agreed among themselves on the same day no man agreed with himself for two days together The beginning of almost all their speeches was at irreconcileable variance with the conclusion  Last year a few garbled papers were laid before parliament and a civil and military plan such as they were This year one part of the ministry confessing their bad information and another their evil intentions call for a much greater measure of confidence than ever Instead of  laying garbled mutilated papers before the House they produce none The taskmasters lessen the provender of their hacks in proportion as they increase their labour  Gentlemen call for the advices from America They are refused They demand the state of their troops in that quarter It is denied them The general outline of the ministerial plan is solicited It is dangerous to divulge it It is asked whether they have any plan at all Still no satisfaction The public know nothing except declarations of innocence and acts of indemnity Hanoverians brought in contrary to law and Russian Auxiliaries never to be brought at all troops that cannot be raised and treaties that are never to be executed powerful fleets and vast armies of which there is nothing certain but the ruinous expence  Such was the language and situation of the Ministers and such the view of affairs even previous to the late changes Every thing called on country gentlemen to begin to think for themselves But there is a further demand on their attention American affairs are now taken out of the hands of Lord North That noble Lord's Dartmouth is removed in order to mark in the most distinct and public manner the total cessation of Lord  North's influence and direction in the American department  A new Secretary of State for the Colonies Lord George Germaine takes the lead in American business At present therefore Lord North's declarations retractations modifications explanations and reservations are wholly out of the question His Lordship is now to fall back and at best to act only a secondary part Those who supported administration as declaring a personal confidence in Lord North have that ground of confidence taken from under them If from a sort of hereditary party regard the Tories felt a respect for Lord North's family I fear whatever Lord George himself may do to please them his family does not afford him that recommendation What then is to be the foundation of implicit trust in the new Minister All we know is that he has always shewn a very rooted hostile disposition to America His Parliamentary prop is Mr Wedderburne his private counsellor is Governor Hutchinson This triumvirate composes the new American cabinet Some country gentlemen may think it right to support these Ministers with as blind a confidence as that with which they supported Lord North and Lord Dartmouth until the middle of last week These new Ministers have been the under workmen of the late Premier  How they came to assume the lead and direction is a matter of curious rather than important speculation But I see no reason for presuming that those who have helped to cause these distractions while they were in a subordinate capacity will reestablish our affairs in a superior situation  These affairs and times will sift and search the principles of men Former majorities were very mixed bodies Many good and quiet men supported Ministers from hatred of bustle and contention from a suspicion that opposition was at bottom as interested as administration At length measures speak a language not to be misunderstood They speak no longer in arguments and conjectures but in effects Our American empire is lost and we know in whose hands that calamity has happened The Ministers are  caught with the Mainer  as the Lawyers say No majority can hide the principals or the abettors  The true country gentleman will now be distinguished from the courtier in masquerade The characteristic of a true country gentleman is his care of the property of his constituents He will not think that railing at rebellion is a reason for taxing his country without any account of the past use of his supplies or any security for their future proper and effectual employment  To tell him that the Americans are defective in their duty will not be a reason for him to neglect his own or to suffer Ministers to neglect theirs He will never believe that the way of suppressing or quieting rebellion in America consists in encouraging deceit negligence or mismanagement at home At a time like this a true English country gentleman will distinguish himself by a constitutional suspicion and a constant desire of account and information On the contrary the courtier in masquerade like those that compound felony in the newspapers and advertise for stolen goods offers his money and assures that  "  no questions will be asked  "  It is true that this latter description of country gentlemen not at all troubled with an impertinent incommodious solicitude and teizing curiosity have received bountifully and of free grace for they called for none  some  satisfaction from the Ministers for all the money they have voted They were told with due solemnity with much pomp and true oracular gravity in both Houses of Parliament  "That there is something in the nature and complexion of this country which disposes it to be disgraced and beaten in the beginning of a war that it has been always so and that as we have begun  the American war in our natural and habitual manner we shall as formerly rise from contempt to honour and from defeat to glory"  I do not mean to derogate in the smallest degree from any one particle of this satisfactory account of our past failure and this solid ground of our future hopes Let the facts and inferences remain for ever unimpeached It would be cruel to nibble at the least crum of this comfort It is indeed the only apology that has been so much as attempted for Ministers and their supporters It is the simple and sole account which gentlemen have to render to their constituents at the Christmas recess of a  Land Tax  entailed on posterity at four shillings in the pound and a  sinking fund  alienated for ever from its original purposes to an eternal but inadequate provision for the interest of growing debts and aggravated establishments  VALENS  LETTER VIII  HOUSE OF COMMONS SHUT  Monday November  Mr MILLER  THE gallery of the House of Commons has for about three weeks been shut against strangers for some reason far more weighty I must suppose than the mere accomodation of the few members who in this cold season chuse to shiver on the half deserted benches or to huddle themselves together and blow their fingers about the Speaker's chair  I am told the Ministers complain that their speeches are misrepresented and this misrepresentation is assigned to the House as a justifiable cause for an utter exclusion of their constituents With all the deference which I bear to the opinions of those gentlemen I must think they are somewhat mistaken in this method of preventing misrepresentation The House cannot hinder  the members from gratifying the curiosity of their friends with accounts of what passes in the debates The sentiments and opinions of Ministers will very naturally be the first object of that curiosity Passion and prejudice on the one side and the ill conception of a drowsy and oblivious acquiescence on the other will not unnaturally render the accounts fallacious or erroneous Thus a material injury may be done to the language of the clearest speakers and to the sentiments of the most accurate close and systematic thinkers A numerous auditory is therefore the only security against the weak accounts of friends and the malignant interpretation of enemies Most men who would not have their sense mistaken wish to be their own interpreters and those who complain that malicious reports are circulated to their disadvantage cannot object to an opportunity of clearing themselves to the world for I always take it as granted that the strangers as we are called are not more to be suspected by Ministers of an ill disposition towards them than many of those whom it is not yet in their power to exclude  This fear of misrepresentation being but a poor reason for turning a popular representative into a secret conclave I rather suspect that strangers are excluded not because Ministers are  misrepresented but because they cannot be understood I have sometimes the honour of being admitted at a coffee house where the members take refreshment to a conversation with some worthy gentlemen who always vote in the majority It must be admitted in their favour that if they are in the secret they are perfectly worthy of the trust reposed in them for they appear to be no more enlightened than myself with regard to the objects which Ministers have in view or with regard to their means of attaining any object whatever In saying this I would not insinuate a thing so much to their prejudice as that their total want of information concerning the plans arguments and opinions of Ministers make the least abatement in the zeal with which they support them  Happily the House of Lords is more accessible What can be the cause Is it that this House being the great natural council of the Crown must of course be less in the secret of affairs than an assembly merely popular Or is it that not being accountable to the people at a general election the Lords are more indifferent than our worthy representatives about the discovery of their sentiments Or must we suppose that the great Ministers there are so much more clear and determinate in their ideas than the involved  Oracles of the House of Commons that they are not more afraid of being misunderstood by two hundred than by twenty  In that residence of wellbred easy popular manners I had lately the happiness of hearing a noble and learned Peer who possesses as great a share of clearness in explaining as he does of power in guiding the public measures From him I thought I should have received that satisfaction which I had in vain sought in other places I was however I must confess perhaps to my shame a little disappointed  Lord Mansfield  instead of opening new matter to us from his own abundant magazines of policy thought proper to refer us to  Doctor Tucker  whose pamphlet I had just bought for a shilling Doctor Tucker is it seems the only person who has put the long agitated question of America on its proper bottom Whatever many of us might have thought before we dare no longer treat the projects of that worthy political and commercial divine as visionary They have received the sanction of the highest authority in the kingdom for station wit learning and abilities The great author of these projects we are told has hit  "upon the true alternative either to make the Colonies submit or totally to abandon them and  then  treat with them for peace as an independent country"  With great deference the commercial Divine is in sort of agreement of opinion with this best of all possible Administrations The Dean and he is sworn never to be a Bishop is of opinion that the Colonies are positively prejedicial to this country and the connection mischievous The Dean therefore draws his conclusion fairly  "Get rid of the Colonis"  Allow his premises and his conclusion is just what every man in his senses would draw If therefore the grave Judge agrees with the Divine he must allow the war to be the absurdest act that madmen ever imagined in their phrenzy yea perhaps the most expensive war that ever was undertaken to insure an object that  is mischievous  I should hardly have imagined that a man of Lord Mansfield's real accuracy and penetration could have been so wonderfully struck with this state of the important question which now engages the attention of the world The alternative proposed by the Doctor under favour seems not to be a true state of the question for besides  absolute submission  and  total separation  there is in all internal disputes evidently a third method I mean that of  reconciliation and compromise  This is a method which though it seems now out of fashion has formerly been sometimes mentioned when nations were involved in a Civil War  Lord Mansfield in this fine speech for such it was strongly recommended a  coalition of parties  The design is certainly laudable But so long as he adheres to this favourite  alternative  the execution it should seem cannot be without great difficulty Whatever may become of this design surely a great statesman ought to have larger views Would it not be altogether as worthy of this great person's conciliatory and lenient talents to bring about a coalition in  empire  as in  party  His Lordship valued himself on having brought about the famous coalition of  parties in and he spoke with much complacency of his share in that memorable transaction He then made his early essays of negotiation in reconciling the  old  to the  young  politicians of that day will he now stand forth in the full maturiry of his wisdom and reconcile the  Mother Country  to her  Colonies  I imagine the difficulties in his way will not be greater though the end will be still more glorious He will not find England more fond of  power  than  the late Duke of Newcastle  He will not find America more disposed to  independence  than  Mr Pitt  nor her spirit more lofty nor her temper more punctilious Lord Mansfield then brought England to unite against her  natural enemies  let him now prevail on her to agree with her  natural friends  He then brought the  Tories  to be good  servants  to a Whig government let him now persuade them to become moderate  masters  to a  Whig  people  If he can do these things he may be assured that when he is  When Murray long enough his country's pride  Shall be no more than Tully or than Hyde  POPE  "no more than Tully or than Hyde"  the English on both sides of the great Ocean pacified by his virtues will to the latest posterity vie with each other in honours to his name While  Tickel on the death of Addison  the pealing organ and the pausing choir accord with the lawnrob'd Prelate who will  mix the ashes of the patriot with the dust of Kings America who boasts no cathedrals and has seen  as yet  no Kings will in her plain churches erect Cenotaphs to his memory and surely his indulgent shade then purged from the dregs of all party sourness will not disdain the simple hymns of a less ostentatious worship but will look down with a gracious and benignant smile on the annual gratitude of an unpolished people and the homely commemoration of an independent preacher  The name of Murray the pride of every alumnus of Westminster has led me into this fanciful excursion among the tombs But to return to the Lord Mansfield  to his Lordship  "so known so honoured in the House of Lords"  and to Doctor TuckerThe learned Lord as well as I can discern seems altogether to agree with the learned Divine in his  state of the case  and he no where contradicts his  general theory  But their  consequent plan  differs as widely as pole from pole The Divine is of opinion that the possession of America is of no advantage to us and therefore with a spirit becoming a Minister of the Gospel as well as a good politician he is for giving the Colonists though not with the best grace in the world that independency which according to him they so much desire to obtain and which as he thinks  it will cost us little or nothing to bestow His ground appears to me to be exceedingly bad but if he can once establish it he is far from reasoning ill His conclusion flows directly and irresistibly from his premises  The Bon Mot of the Bishop of Gloucester concerning two Divines is now rather trite One of them whom I shall not name he said made his religion a trade the other Dr Tucker much to his credit in a commercial country made trade his religion Without venturing on so much freedom with the Dean as his Bishop may be allowed to use it is certain that next to religion he has applied to this subject with the most diligence and with very great success He would have applied with very little diligence to it and with no success at all if he did not know that first elemental principle in the criss cross row of commerce which isthe imprudence of throwing good money after bad and expending a capital without expectation of return  Lord Mansfield did not on that day explain how it happens that seeming at least entirely to agree with Dr Tucker concerning the commercial importance of America he is willing to exhaust mines of treasure and to spill seas of blood to reduce the Colonies to what he calls  submission  and they term  slavery  "To compel them to submit"  are words of no precise meaning To what is it the Americans are to submit To regulations of trade If Lord Mansfield agrees with the Dean of Gloucester these regulations so far from being valuable are in reality rather mischievous to ourselves A war to compel  such  submission may well be called  unnatural  Is it to taxation they are to submit If so the end and the sole end of  taxation  being  revenue  that is to say  profit  it is like all other profit a matter of calculation If our present proceedings promise at any time to produce a profit commensurate to the blood expence and risque or any profit at all we then have an object Whether we are likely to succeed in it by the means we use is another question but ministry acting wisely or unwisely do in that case pursue something  I attended with all the diligence due to his great abilities to Lord Mansfield on that his great day and I must confess I received no more satisfaction from him on the probability of this revenue than I had received from the House of Commons whilst that House permitted their constituents to hear the reasons they assign for the burthens they impose  The nation is not kindly treated It is docile enough but the masters refuse to teach To  make a war for  taxation  without an estimate of  revenue  is not rational I say no worse of it Lord Mansfield should have given this estimate He has been Chancellor of the Exchequer or a picture I have somewhere seen belies him The present Chancellor of the Exchequer in his business at least does not seem to be more than a picture a very faint representation of a great financier With submission an estimate of this sort would be of something more importance and a little more to the point than this learned Lord's History of American hereditary disaffection The original sin of the Colonies  independence  which however entertaining and every thing from him must be entertaining was little to the purpose of that argument But as he chose to dwell upon it I am sure it answered some purpose and therefore it derserves a great deal of consideration  I propose to examine it carefully if an obscure writer in a newspaper may venture to criticise on the elaborate performance of a person of so much dignity  VALENS  LETTER IX  AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE  Saturday December  MR MILLER  OUR unhappy civil contest notwithstanding the innumerable evils which it has produced is attended with some advantage The state of the provinces lately our's is come to be understood even by Ministers The utter impracticability of drawing a revenue from America is universally acknowledged The point of taxation has been over and over again abandoned It is however thought necessary to lengthen the duration and to augment the rigours of a war begun upon the sole principle of taxation Having first made war for that object and that object being found impracticable we must now provide an object for the war Here is a demand for ingenuity and Lord Mansfield steps forward  The aim of the Colonies at absolute  independency  is now made the ground of war and lest the conduct of the present inhabitants should not furnish proof enough for the purpose they are to be visited with the sins of their forefathers from the third and fourth generation and ancient history is to be suborned as the evidence of recent guilt I really do not relish this method of digging up the bones of departed error in order to render the fire of persecution more intense against present heterodoxy I know and confess that the people of New England were early in their  resistance  to King James I do not pretend to defend them in  that  act of rebellion or in that fondness for innovation which for any proof I can bring to the contrary was their true motive for submission to the government of King William That they did so resist and so submit is a matter of fact indisputable But whether the one is or the other or both equally are to be alledged as valid proof of their former desire of  independence  is more than I can presume to determine  But something I will beg leave to say upon the whole of this method of historically criminating our provinces I am very certain Lord Mansfield would not so much as hear of it in his  judicial  capacity and on this subject I must appeal from the politician to the magistrate  In the first place his Lordship would hardly think it fair to ransack the history of  one  or at the utmost  two  provinces and the Journals of one or two assemblies and on account of every mutinous act or peevish vote to be found in them to conclude  twelve  more to be guilty without citing one single act or vote of any of the twelve to prove the common charge in which they are  all  involved But according to the modern mode of proceeding in the  evidence  we find Massachusetts Bay in the  sentence  we find the colonies This little  s  slipped in as if by accident forms the small but venomed sting in the  tail  that is to be mortal to two million of people Such a loose method of crimination would do well enough in a newspaper paragraph of a ministerial writer or in a dutiful and loyal address from a fifth  Such there are among the Addresses the Ministers alue themselves upon  part of a Scotch borough but it was hardly to be expected from the accuracy and precision of a great reasoner or from the equity and impartiality of a conscientious Judge  The colonies have been until our late proceedings united them unconnected and independent of each other If the history of Massachusetts Bay or Rhode Island had been a tissue of rebellions without one moment's peace or obedience how are Pennsylvania Virginia Maryland the two  Jerseys the two Carolinas or even Connecticut or New Hampshire answerable It was enough to make these Colonies responsible for the acts of their own forefathers in a right line and not to charge them with collateral delinquency for the offences of the political progenitors of other people  I am obliged in the next place to lament seriously that Lord Mansfield in reading the history of even  one  the worst if he please of the colonies in order from thence to infer the guilt of the  whole  should not have been able to perceive any thing in all that history besides acts of resistance and revolt I shall beg leave to remind his Lordship that until this unfortunate period that colony Massachusetts Bay certainly never did take up arms against the Crown It certainly did make some provision for the support of his Majesty's government It certainly did raise sums of money and very large sums too at several times for the public service It certainly did spill a great deal of such blood as it had to spill in the quarrels of this country The wealth of the colony was not equal to ours nor their blood as noble as Lord Mansfield's But there is an eye in which the widow's mite is not altogether disregarded and in which the blood of the yeoman is not without an account  This total omission of every act of duty fidelity or affection in settling the account even of this colony is so far from being judicially fair that in the light of mere history it must be blamed as defective If I had observed that extraordinary omission any where but in a speech of Lord Mansfield I should have taken it for one of the worst kinds of falshood  "a suppression of truth"  But that omission being his I am persuaded it arises from any thing sooner than an intention to deceive I have heard that his Lordship like other great lawyers in great practice has frequently employed a brother of less fame and less occupation at the Bar in the capacity of what the cant of WestminsterHall calls  "  a Case Hunter  "  or  Searcher for Precedents  This more laborious than intelligent instrument mistaking Lord Mansfield's directions and forgetting that his Lordship was a great parliamentary Judge and not a retained advocate in a party cause produced all the precedents which could be useful towards establishing the charge against the colonies and according to his low idea of prudence suppressed every thing which might make in their favour I should recommend to his Lordship instantly to dismiss his present  Case Hunter  and to take some other into his service who may be more capable of entering  into his real views and of sustaining the true dignity of his character  In this plan of substituting hereditary disaffection as a ground for a war in the room of taxation the original object of it but now abandoned I have mentioned two capital errors The one that the charge is general and the proof partial The other that the evil actions are stated and the good omitted I must beg leave to add a third of perhaps as much moment as the other twoThat these things are charged as  peculiar  crimes to the colonies which if they are faults are faults of human nature in their circumstances and which if we go on to consider as crimes and as grounds of war or of punishment we cannot possibly enjoy any peace now or hereafter I will endeavour to explain myself In countries pretending to any degree of freedom struggles against exertions of power are not uncommon nor unnatural and even claims of right on the part of the subject sometimes better sometimes worse grounded are not to surprize us I suppose our whole civil history is made up of such disputes If men of a certain description were to be the judges the people of England would be called to a severe account Mr Hume has passed judgement upon many of these claims even those claims which are now sanctified by what some statesmen  think the best of all arguments Success That great author considers what we now deem the rights of the people to have been formerly invasions on the rights of the Sovereign and the struggles relative to them he pronounces to have been contests in which the Crown acted only on the defensive  It is no miracle if a colony at such an immense distance with ill defined rights and under no trifling commercial restraints should at one time or other pass some votes derogatory to the power of Parliament Did Parliament itself at no time pass votes derogatory even to its own rights Did Parliament never compliment the Crown with the most sacred rights of the people On the other hand did Parliament at no time shew a violent disorderly and factious spirit in any of her proceedings  I believe if Lord Mansfield sends his  Precedent Hunter  to the Journals of either or both Houses to select from such votes matter to ground an attack on the rights of the people of England as having at some period factiously abused or servilely betrayed them he will be supplied with far more abundant and far less questionable matter for the purpose than in the Journals not simply of the Massachusetts Assembly but in all the Journals of that whole Continent  Yet if Parliament should by any accident happen to come to a dispute with the Crown or what is quite impossible with the people would it be fair to prove from these resolutions a long premeditated scheme in that body either to rob the Crown of its rights or to establish an arbitrary power in the King  This learned Lord will consider on a rehearing of this cause that these assemblies are  not  permanent bodies That for the greater part they have but a year's duration That an Assembly in illhumour with their Governor will pass an angry resolution which one in a better temper totally disregards which is in some time entirely forgot which is never acted upon and never thought of by themselves or by any body else until some ingenious persons being left destitute of any other pretext choose to put together all these unconnected scraps in order to make them an excuse for desolating the finest countries and ruining the most flourishing commerce by the cruel turpitude and unprincipled vengeance of a piratical war  That these kind of votes do not serve as regular principles to influence the conduct of men we know by our examples at home Several dormant votes and resolutions which Lord Mansfield will neither act upon nor expunge still remain  on the Journals of that very House where he so justly sways with an unbounded authority The Commons have deemed some of them highly derogatory to their rights The Lords held them necessary to the rights of the subject and to the preservation of the law of the land I speak here of the resolutions in the case of Ashby and White on occasion of the Aylesbury election yet though these votes still remain on the Journals of the House of Lords who can accuse the House of Lords  at this day  of any attempt to support the rights of the subject or to assert the law of the landagainst the pretensions of the House of Commons Chief Justice  Holt  sat on the very seat which Lord Mansfield now fills with so much more prudence  Holt  countenanced those proceedings of the House of Lords and indeed it was his irregular zeal for the law that first gave rise to them But is it fair from thence to suppose Lord Mansfield chargeable with these or any other irregular or blameable proceedings or with the intemperate zeal of Chief Justice Holt  For the present I submit these few observations to those gentlemen who some time ago made war with so much eagerness to compel the Colonies to contribute to the support of empire They were then at war for taxes never to be obtained let them take care that they are not now at war against  an  independency  that never has been attempted They are on a business of bloodlet them be sure that the evidence is sufficient They shall hear again upon this subject which I take to be material to the public  VALENS  LETTER X  IRISH INDEPENDENCE  Tuesday Sept  MR MILLER  LORD Mansfield has been lately left alone in the House of Lords  "All the obliged have deserted and all the vain"  He who but a few days before and with such decided authority had passed a bloody sentence upon whole nations has not been able to regulate the trial of one old woman  Alludes to the remarkable controversy between Lord Mansfield and Lord Lyttelton on the mode of trying the Duchess of Kingston the House adopted Lord Lyttelton's plan in preference to Lord Mansfield  His judicial conflict was with a boy and he was baffled These indications of some odd change though they appear in slight matters are warnings which a wise man will not disdain to take They ought in some measure to abate the pride of power and the confidence in favour They ought to supple the heart and to make it susceptible of the soft contagion of our nature They ought to dispose it towards a favourable  hearing of millions of people lately flourishing opulent peaceful and happy but now doomed to be the harrassed and persecuted object of eternal piracy rapine and devastation  If Lord Mansfield should be found thus softened towards an unfortunate rejected branch of the English race perhaps in some moments of humiliation so favourable to clemency he might turn his eyes on the English stock itself He might begin to suspect that the sufferings of war cannot be confined to one side only and that our own share of these calamities may be worthy of some consideration He might feel the glory of burning the petty fishing town Falmouth in NewEngland balanced by the taking of  St John  's he might think the stealing by Lord  Dunmore  of a dozen or two of little honeycombed iron ship guns from a deserted wharf in  Virginia  of not quite so much importance as the loss of  Canada  Though it is undoubtedly some comfort to insult the few Provincial Officers we take by throwing them with common men into a gaol and some triumph to hold the bold adventurer Ethan Allen in irons in a dungeon in Cornwall yet it may be thought not quite so pleasant on the other had to have the corps of English Fuzileers prisoners of war by capitulation in

helpt to defeat the miserable ruin of the finances of this kingdom and that backsliding which after twelve years peace has let us down into that condition of debt in which we were left at the end of a war with half EuropeAll these considerations may at a calm hour rise in an awful series before Lord Mansfield and forcing one natural sigh for the distresses of humanity may dispose him to listen to an humble plea for peace They may perhaps incline his ear to sober enquiry whether even an imperfect authority is not more eligible than a compleat war and whether all things considered the spoils of America will be in reality so much a better thing than its commerce  Lord Mansfield's argument against the  present  Colonies from the votes of  one  of them in time  past  was examined in my last letter  I shall now take this business in another point of view For a while I will go along with his Lordship He shall have granted to him not only all but much more than he assumes I will allow  that the Journals not of  one  but of  all  the assemblies are full of factious resolutions Having for argument admitted this I must beg leave to accompany my concession with a matter of  fact  which though it will not at all excuse such contumacy in the Americans it may abate some degree of that astonishment and indignation which it seems to excite in a veteran politician who has breathed the air of seventy winters in our climate of clear and unclouded virtue  The Twelve United Colonies have twelve popular assemblies The number of Members they contain may be as large within a trifle as the Parliament of Great Britain They are probable about five hundred persons Will his Lordship ask what  douceurs  are distributed among the whole body of these Representatives I do assure him on the strictest enquiry I do not find that the  twelve  American Parliaments and the whole  five hundred  men who compose them receive among them all one  fifth  part of the value of what is held by  one  single gentleman whom I could name in the House of Commons  It is not that the soil of the plantations does not yield the constitutional staple of lucrative employments But these employments are almost all with much more propriety bestowed in aid of a contracted English civil list and as a support  and security to the independence of a British Parliament They are certainly better bestowed for I have constantly observed that all those gentlemen who hold American employments have been the most zealous of all others against the insolent claims of the Colonists and the most determined resisters of that factious and interested spirit which dares unnaturally to insult so gracious and beneficent a government  If we did not know to a certainty that not a shilling is spent in England upon elections and that the emoluments so liberally distributed in Parliament have no share in producing any part of that complaisance to government which distinguishes our age and puts to shame the stubborn spirit of our ancestors we might instead of being astonished at such instances of opposition be rather surprised how it has happened that in popular assemblies so little managed the opposition to government has not been greater more frequent more fierce and more extensive So much rich compost is laid upon the highly dressed and productive soil of a British Parliament and such attention is bestowed on its thorough cultivation that these remote parts have been neglected and suffered to shoot out all the wild weeds of a vigorous but uncultivated nature Except insulting reproaches angry prorogations sudden dissolutions  rejected petitions with now and then a challenge  Vide Governor Hutchinson's famous speech  to dispute on the origin of government I can find nothing that has been practised to  "tame the genius of the stubborn plain"  or to mollify the hereditary spirit of independency that is charged upon the American Assemblies Under such indolent neglect and such churlish attentions I could not positively answer for the mellowness and tractability even of a civilized British Parliament I should not however conclude from some sour humours in our Houses of Parliament that a barren  independence  was the object of their wishes but that like pevish virgins they longed for something else  Opposition to the authority of acts of Parliament is not a thing new in the dependencies of this empire nor confined to America A denial of that authority in much greater extent had once been very popular in Ireland  Molineux  one of their most celebrated authors a great natural philosopher like Doctor Franklin a friend and a correspodent of Locke wrote a book which is still in request The object of this book is to prove that England had no power to make  any laws whatever  to bind Ireland The assertion is not limited to taxes it is as broad and general as legislature itself on the largest plan That book indeed was  burnt by the hands of the common hangman  here  but the doctrines gained so much ground  there  that the Judges who admitted appeals to England were persecuted by the Irish Houses of Lords and Commons with the greatest rigour and asperity and obliged to fly in a body to England  In consequence of this a declaratory act was passed asserting the supreme legislative authority of Great Britain Nothing further was done No troops were sent or employed to enforce obedience Time was given for the public ferment to subside The appeal to the House of Lords in England was left to find its own way by its own utility and utility effected that which force could not have effected The Irish suitors found an advantage in a judicature removed from local affections and local prejudices At the same time the Irish Parliament was  soothed  instead of being  bullied  The leading interests were gained The stubborn were softened and the angry pacified By degrees as it was natural the storm was blown over The Irish Parliament kept its resolutions England received its appeals No harsh laws were passed for the purpose of a  test  No  tax  was imposed for a  trial  of obedience The question of the right remains to this day open for the declamation of any gentleman in the Irish or English  Parliament and is frequently used with great innocence as the interest or whim of the orator on either side directs him  In Ireland it was not only in votes and resolutions of Parliament that the authority of Great Britain has met with opposition The resistance to the trade laws by tumultuous violence has been frequent and often successful Wool was and is carried off in great quantities and great mobs have frequently destroyed imported goods in one of the principal cities of that kingdom while other mobs intimidated officers from preventing an export of prohibited manufactures in the other It is not long since the exportation of live cattle to England was prevented by violence a violence at which the Magistrates of Ireland thought proper to wink Parliament thought proper to wink in its turn at that violence and that neglect  But if Parliament on hearing of these disorders had directed the offending Irish ports to be blocked up until the King should think proper to open them If on the neglect of Magistrates full as chargeable on Ireland as America an Act of Parliament had violently subverted the corporate rights of their cities If on the votes of the Irish Parliament derogatory to the authority of the supreme legislature they had violently changed the constitution of the secondary Parliament  If they had refused all peace to Ireland until the banished Judges had reassumed their function and until full compensation was made to them for their lossesthere is no doubt that war alone would have settled our controversy with Ireland as it must if we persevere in the present measure settle our controversy with America  To this hour the degree of subordination which Ireland owns is altogether unascertained Ministers complain that America in denying our right to tax has not stated clearly the submission which she admits to be due to the authority of Parliament But has Ireland ever recognized half so much as America does in her letter to the people of England Is it true that in the mean time she is quiet dutiful and obedient and she is so because this recognition never was required Her late most extraordinary complaisance to the Clerk of the Pells and to the Vice Treasurers those  profitable  servants  Charles Jenkinson Esq Henry Flood Esq Lord Clare and Welbore Ellis Esq by a late vote of the Irish Parliament have l a year each over and above their expences The first for life  of the public shews that in spite of her Journals and the petulance of her progenitors she can prove as subservient as can be wished to the convenience of administration  Ireland gives largely to all public services and what is infinitely more important to all private jobbsWhy Because it is she that  gives  and not we that  take  Administration has lately furnished a signal proof of their own opinion of the wisdom of enforcing all the rights of the supreme legislature It was but the other day the beginning of this session that government applied to the Irish Parliament for liberal grants in order to supply very large deficiencies One would suppose from the doctrines of Lord Mansfield and his colleagues concerning America that the Minister in the Irish House of Commons in order to succeed must have opened his Budget by an high assertion of the rights of the English Parliament to tax Ireland and that he had concluded by desiring them on the plan of Lord North's  conciliatory  motion to furnish such a contingent to the support of empire as Parliament here should think proper The proceeding of that successful Minister was the direct reverse Instead of getting the Irish House of Commons to acknowledge this right he  himself  in effect disclaimed it He even denied that the English Ministry ever had asserted it and he described the speeches on that subject in the English House of Commons though made by men in the greatest offices  "as nothing more than  the rash language of inconsiderate individuals"  Our correspondent seems to allude to Mr Rigby and Mr Charles Jenkinson who asserted in the English House of Commons the right of the English Parliament to tax Ireland which assertion of theirs Sir John Blaquiere treated as Valens represents itVide the speeches in Almon's Register  Having very wisely disclaimed authority the Irish Minister succeeded by intreaty If he had held the language there which English Ministers held to the English Colonies the Parliament of that kingdom would hardly have been persuaded to lend their troops in order to subdue Ireland in America The only dependent part of the empire which is at peace is at peace by Ministry's  disclaiming  not by  enforcing  our rightThe only revenue which is obtained is obtained where the power of imposing is renounced So different so very different is unsubstantial theory from sound practice  I flatter myself I have shewn that the opposition to the extent of parliamentary powers has not been confined to America I have shewn that the denial in Ireland was of a  larger  entent than that in America and therefore a denial of a  less  extent confined to the right to tax could be no proof of a formed design of independency on the part of the Colonies if denial in a  larger  extent cannot convict Ireland of the same offence I  have shewn that the Parliament of Ireland never made any formal acknowledgement of the power of this legislature to bind that kingdom that the power of England there arose from our not pushing every point and that the astonishing obsequiousness of Ireland at this hour is owing to our not having made use of any one of those methods of asserting authority which have been recommended and used in America All this forms at least a presumption against the utility of such methods  I hope indulgence a little longer in this humble plea to Lord Mansfield on the trial of America for  misprision of independence  If in the end what I will not imagine the Judge should give a harsh charge the Jury of the public may possibly prove as refractory to the authority of Lord Mansfield as the House of Peers has been on a late occasion and though he directs them to convict they may still with some remains of English firmness bring in the prisoner Not Guilty  VALENS  LETTER XI  CRIMINAL INTENTIONS  Thursday Nov  MR MILLER  IT seems to be in the natural course of things that men are very rarely brought to a sense of guilt or folly but through the medium of suffering We are obliged to the Ministry for having placed us in this school of wholesome discipline  The misconduct of the present war will by degrees lead the nation into a disposition to enquire into the justice of it Never was a war more open to an impartial examination of its merits No Glare of false glory in the execution of our American measures has hidden the defects or gilded over the errors of the original plan We have only to pray that our instruction may not come too late for our amendment  I cannot easily quit the opinion that however bitterly we may quarrel there is still such a bottom of good nature generosity and good sense both in the European and American part of the English nation as will at length incline the one to hold out unequivocal solid  honest  terms of accommodation and induce the other to meet those terms though late and ungracious in the offer with a cordial and dutiful acquiescence  "The Americans are at war" says Lord Mansfield the great assertor of the plan of hostility "they are acting on the  offensive  whether we were  right or wrong  we must proceedwe must add violence to violence rigour to rigourwe are not to discriminate the innocent from the guiltyif we do not kill them they will kill us"  It is really singular that a man in the cool decline of life bred through the whole course of it in a profession of peace a Civil Magistrate a Judge covered to the chin with judicial purple and bloodless unspotted ermins should be distinguished above all others for a character of hazard and desperateness in his counsels Lord Mansfield's politics always stand upon a precipice When he acted with others in advising the late coercive measures he alone was under no delusion His eyes were broad open to the consequences  Knowing that those measures led inevitably to Civil War he used the fatal expression and auspice of Caesar when he stood on the execrated brink of that stream the crossing of which brought ruin on his country He told the House of Lords in plain words that  "they had now passed the  Rubicon  "  This Year he exhorts them to push on that Civil War in a manner scarcely different from the precedent of Caesar's  Dum tela micant non vos pietatis Imago  Ulla nec adversa conspecti Fronte parentes  Commoveant vultus gladio turbate verendos  Sive quis infefto cognata in pectora ferro  Ibit seu nullum violabit vulnere pignus  Ignoti jugulum tanquam scelus imputet hostis  speech before the battle of Pharsalia But we are not yet hardened by this inflammatory eloquence into such black and decided enmity as to unfit us for a temperate examination of his cause and arguments  "Kill them or they will kill us"  Alas my good Lord Englishmen cannot chearfully accept this alternative which you are so good to offer until we are thoroughly convinced that to kill them is not mortally to wound ourselves  This military adage  "Kill them or they will kill us"  is as proper in the field of battle as it is misplaced and dangerous in council  When men have the bayonet to each other's breast there is no time for reasoning But men deliberating at their ease are not in that desperate situation It is not therefore necessary that they should be animated with these desperate sentiments The business of the Statesman and that of the General ought never to be confounded It is the Province of the latter to consider only how War is to be  made  It is the duty of the former sometimes to consider how war is to be  ended  Reconciliation treaty negociation and concession enter into the plan of the Statesman though not in the operations of the General If Lord Mansfield's sentiments should prevail as maxims of policy it would follow that when men upon whatever grounds are driven to draw their swords there must be no peace until one party or the other is exterminated  That learned Lord rests much on the  offensive war  undertaken by the Americans in what is called the Invasion of Canada This he adduces as a proof of their design of independency If war had been as much Lord Mansfield's study as it seems to be his inclination he must have perceived that it never was nor ever could be confined to strict defence The very idea is full of absurdity When war is once begun the  manner of conducting it will be such as bids the fairest for success It concludes nothing concerning the original motive for hostility nor concerning the propriety or impropriety of making peace  These Things stand upon grounds totally different the desire of independency like every other motive to war must be judged of by the proceedings previous to that event  For instance I can conceive a case in which  Scotland  might take up arms Scotland might defend the terms of the treaty of union even against the unlimitable authority of Parliament which that treaty by  "a preposterous parade of civil arrangements"  certainly does  affect  to limit I can conceive in argument that acts of parliament might pass to exclude the sixteen Peers of Scotland from their seats in the House of Lordsor to alter the present happy establishment of the Church of Scotlandor to change her laws for those of Englandor on the plea of her increase of trade and wealth to raise the proportion of their landtax I can conceive too the  possibility  that many Murrays many Humes many Campbells many Stuarts many Wedderburnes many Dundasses and many Elliotts might take up arms in favour of those limitations of the power of Parliament which  the act of Union  affects  to establish and not contenting themselves with defending  Sterling  and blocking up  Edinburgh  they might enter  England  and lay siege to  Berwick  or penetrate to  Newcastle  But I should not therefore infer that our Northern Kinsmen who thus took up arms were aiming at an  independency  which would deprive so many of them of the wellearned emoluments which are the consequence of their connection with England  If such a case were to happen I venture to assure Lord Mansfield that I and many Englishmen of far other consequence would hear him plead in favour of peace and for  those  rebels in with as much approbation as we felt when he pleaded for justice against  other  rebels in If any Lord heated with faction or intoxicated with Court favour should then tell him in debate that Englishmen were not to look at the justice of the causethat we must not distinguish the innocent from the guiltythat his countrymen had acted on the offensivethat if we did not kill them they would kill uswe might pardon such a Lord his prejudice from our indulgence to his zeal but we could never be brought to approve of his temper or to adopt his opinions  If another Lord at the expence of his candour and judgement should chuse to display his knowledge in history and recapitulate all the ravages of the Scotch from the earliest times their natural adherence to our natural enemy France their fierce struggles for independency notwithstanding the wellproved rights of our ancient KingsIf a third for such a load of calumny would be too great for the shoulders of any two ordinary orators should carry down the story to the present day if he should state the design of a separate settlement of their crown in favour of the Pretender from which their Chiefs were brought off with so much difficulty and at so great an expence if this odious remembrancer should then revive the memory of the two rebellions since the act of Union for the purpose of destroying that union all this might sound plausible to some prejudiced ears but I think in well disposed minds it would excite the strongest indignation I should rejoice to hear the thunder of that eloquence which Lord Mansfield would certainly hurl at the unfeeling sophistry of this unjust invidious and plausible kind of argument against peace He would have the hearts and applauses of all true Englishmen True Englishmen would not fear that Scotland would be made ungovernable by our lenity they  would readily trust to the fraternal affection of our Scotch brethren for a restoration of lasting peace and with it the rich Commerce of that country and the service and society of those few of its natives who might not think fit to repass the Tweed to enjoy at home the sweets of that liberty which their valour had purchased for their country  In this manner I should reason on a Scotch rebellion growing from such a principle I mean a rebellion for preserving themselves in a state of freedom not a rebellion for the purpose of reducing themselves and us to a common slavery I cannot avoid applying the same reasonings to America I would endeavour to make peace with both on the  avowed  ground of the war and I persuade myself that whatever the language of a few NorthBritons about the Court or expecting to get about the Court may be the body of the Scotch nation think and argue as I do  I have no right to endeavour at discovering by divination the secret motives of any man's conduct whilst the ostensible are such as may fairly influence an honest and a reasonable man To support in argument that independency was the original object of American resistance we must assume or prove that they had no colourable  complaint or grievance Lord Mansfield has too much honour and good sense to assert that there was nothing colourable or plausible in their objection to their being taxed in their circumstances and situation without their consent The practice on our side may for aught I know be reconciled to principles of strict formal  law  but we all know it can never be reconciled to any principles of  liberty  The Question is then whether an attempt to govern them contrary to the principles of liberty could be a real cause of quarrel or was so idle and frivolous as to oblige us to search for some other ground of their conduct  Whatever the first cause was or whatever disorders arose from it the Americans did not go to extremities upon  that  It is some proof of their not having premeditated a scheme of independency that they waited for several other grievances before they took up arms  Boston lost its port and the Colony of Massachusett's Bay forfeited its Charterjustly says Lord Mansfield but certainly without charge evidence or hearing Men consider the right of being heard as of some import in justice if it be not Lord Mansfield's office must become a finecure Among other human frailties men have a natural love for their local constitutions  and particular privileges We must allow that however merited the loss of a favourite form of Government will be considered and felt as a very great hardship Nations have thought an arbitrary and compulsory change even of habits to be grievous A form of government changed is a matter of somewhat more consequence than the compulsory deprivation of a flapped hat at Madrid or being stripped of the plaid and forced into breeches in the  The reader need scarce be told that in the year the attempt to oblige the Spaniards by force to leave off a slouched hat that was in use among them created such a disturbance among the people of Madrid as obliged the King to fly from his capital and made it necessary for him to send his Favourite out of the kingdom who has never returned since Much less do we suppose it necessary to inform the reader that the permission of quitting his breeches and resuming his plaid is at this moment held out as a bribe to allure the Highlanders into the new levies against America  Highlands  The bringing the persons of the Americans to trial in England by a revival and extension of a Statute of Henry the VIIIth and the sending them by an original act of George the IIId to England to look for justice on any soldier or CustomHouse Officer who should commit murder on their relationthese have also something of the air of a grievance I shall say nothing of the  Act for preventing their Fishery or of that for prohibiting all intercourse between Colony and Colonyall these have surely so much the air of hardships I mean to those who suffer under them that I should be much less surprised to find a people at length provoked to independency by such acts than I am to hear them accused of originally scheming that independency because they resisted them Men are not always ready to humble themselves even before their Creator and to acknowledge his punishments for tokens of lovingkindness With men they are more inclined to dispute and the arguments which perfectly satisfy those who are in haste to inflict punishment are not quite so convincing to those who are to suffer it  All those laws which look severe even in cold reading preceded the commencement of hostilities offesinve or defensive It is not true that a desire of free subjection is in nature the same thing with a scheme of independence and we may suppose men earnest to preserve privileges without rejecting government  The Colonies like others who have engaged in wars with their Sovereign had therefore their grievance But there the likeness stops for there are perhaps no instances on record of a people in such a situation who have persevered  with such a pertinacious humility in repeating their supplications for redress There are few or no instances of men in arms against the ordinary Authority who have so long confined their applications solely to their own sovereign Scarce any where they have religiously avoided all caballing and tampering with foreign Powers None where they have so nobly paid their debts to the commerce of that power with which they were at war Whatever power we have of subsisting without them or of acting against them is owing in a great measure to their desire of avoiding a final rupture with us Men aiming at independency could never have acted in this manner  Why in common sense should we be more irritated against the Colonist than against other nations or why should we use other rules to prevent pacification than we use towards a foreign power I should be glad to know whether this mode of reasoning concerning old delinquency or modern ill design was adopted at the late treaty of Paris Did the late Duke of Bedford's instructions oblige him to a discussion of the motives of France and Spain for half a century back I don't find that our Court has received any satisfaction on that head If the zeal and industry  of Sir John Dalrymple or Mr Macpherson have made any discovery in this curious mode of negotiation they will favour the world with a new quarto volume for the information of future Statesmen In the mean time I must think that I do Justice to the late Duke of Bedford a Man of sense and a good practical man of business in supposing that he troubled himself with no idle enquiries that could obstruct the work of pacification I do not hear that Lord Mansfield has ever accused that Duke of a neglect duty  But we must not treat with Rebels What history is it that supplies us with this maxim Lord Mansfield will allow that the war against Charles the First was a rebellion Lord Clarendon I believe stiles it by preeminence the  great rebellion  does the history of that time supply us with no treaty between Charles the First and the people in arms against him Go to earlier times How was the contest between Stephen and Henry Stephen was considered as an usurper and perhaps he was so He treated Henry's partizans as rebels but these harsh names of Rebel and Usurper never prevented negotiation Treaty and battle went on as it were hand in hand and at last the contest ended in a compromise  The short and violent rebellion of Wat Tyler short as it was yet afforded time for treating and that too by the King in person Does the Scotch History supply no instances of treaties between the rebellious Lords and their Kings All histories are full of them Government often finds it safer to treat with her subjects and to yield too than to risk the uncertain event of arms  But in all wars foreign or civil in all disputes public or private it is utterly impossible to terminate a controversy while one of the litigant parties chuses to assume a sort of supernatural talent of discovering the motives of mens actions and loftily tells his adversary  "I dont value your offers and professions I know you mean what you dont say and I will not treat with you on the avowed and apparent cause of the quarrel until my curiosity is satisfied upon the ground of a suspicion which I am resolved to entertain"  I am persuaded that this learned Lord would not argue so inconclusively or waste his breath upon a point not in issue if the real object of Ministry was to terminate the dispute What his Lordship's object is I who take the liberty of complaining of his faculty of divination and who am by no means provided with the endless line of his sagacity in fathoming  the motives of men do not at all knowand certainly dare not guess But the effect of the conduct of his friends in pertinaciously continuing and weakly conducting a war without an object will inevitably operate to the dismemberment of the British Empire  VALENS  LETTER XII  THE GAZETTE  Thursday June  MR MILLER  IN my paper of the th of January last I compleated to the best of my power the little plan I had originally formed I had proposed to take a view of the policy of the American war its objects its conduct and the motives for engaging in it When this was done being no politician by profession I laid down my pen I resume it for a moment in order to make a few remarks upon the manner in which the Ministry have handled their's I have formerly endeavoured to do justice to their merit as Statesmen I am now to consider their skill as writers  As all men have their virtues a little balanced by some failings it is surely a goodnatured part not to dwell upon the qualities they are deficient  in but rather to fix our attention on those points of their character in which they evidently excell I should think it the cruellest thing in the world to dwell upon Lord George Germain's conduct of the civil war but I am happy to join with the world in applauding his Lordship's dexterous management of the Gazette  Whilst under his auspices and animated by his example our commanders by happily  shifting  of their position by taking the resolution of  evacuating  towns and by effecting  retreats  without loss are though quite in a new way conquering Provinces abroad his Lordship is employed according to the soundest principles of the best critics in recording their great exploits at home  Livy has been censured as diffuse Sallust Thucydides and Tacitus have been criticized for an affected brevity bordering on the obscure These general remarks savour of pedantry and meer literary cant To judge of the faults or excellence of the diffuse or the concise of the perspicuous or the obscure styles we must consider well the nature of the subject and the design of the author No universal rule can be laid down Some things cannot be displayed too amply and too minutely to the public curiosity Others had better be just touched upon Some should shine in a glare of light others should be cast modestly into  the shade Some ought to be proclaimed by the sound of trumpet others there are in which silence is the real eloquence  If you would know how well Lord George Germain has employed all these styles and this no style you must consider the end and purpose for which besides fame and immortality a Secretary of State condescends to become an author  The world at large is not aware of the real object of our war in America The sole drift and end of all our operations there has hitherto been neither more nor less than to dispose of the sums of money that have been raised here These have been vast and the dispersion of them has not been so perfectly easy as the common run of people might imagine But by the aid of our kind and disinterested friends the London contractors and the German Princes the thing may be done The facility however of the expenditure may not always facilitate the supply A great Statesman like other ingenious artists must tickle the ear whilst he extracts the purse The mob out of doors love a little good news though it be at their own cost A victory is worth a million and a good bonfire compensates a tax The wise Minister like the industrious ant forecasts the winter and prepares the mind for the ways and means of the session by the intelligence with which he entertains  us during the recess In the execution of this plan he strictly follows the great masters of antiquity  The polite critic of the Court of Augustus Horace was intended by that great Emperor not so happy in obtaining obedience to his commands as our Sovereign for the office of  Ab Epistolis  Secretary of State Whilst that business was in agitation he wrote those excellent rules for Gazettes which have been unaccountably mistaken for the rules of dramatic poetry A gross error for what has a Secretary of State to do with  writing  tragedies Or how can we imagine that Horace after commanding a Roman legion and distinguishing himself in war should condescend to undertake the direction of the opera The Gazette is the proper business of his department Besides the observations on style that I have just made and which I confess I borrowed from this great judge he makes several others of moment He advises his Gazette writer to mix his falshood with some truth  ita mentitur  says he  ut veris falsa remiscet  And he gives his reason and a very solid one  Primo ne medium medio ne discrepat imum  He recommends it to them to put off and to bring on matters as may best suit political purposes  Ut uunc dicat jam nunc debentia dici  Pleraque differat et presens in tempus omittat  But if facts prove so very untractable as by no art of mixture or procrastination to be made pleasant why then he thinks they are to be totally omitted  Quae  Desperat tractata nitescere posse relinquit  To exemplify in the most satisfactory manner his Lordship's skill in conducting his Gazette upon these rules the reader may remember the ample account we had of the exploits of Lord Dunmore Not one captive piece was omitted of those miserable old cannon which until they were to  "open their mouths and shew forth his praise"  had slept and rusted in neglect on the wharfs of Virginia All the pompous display of Livy and Clarendon were employed to decorate the triumph of this favourite General After this great and decisive advantage obtained by Lord Dunmore as far as we could discover from the Gazette we had nothing to do but to take possession of a disarmed Province The gratitude of the nation was equal to the services of the General His Lordship was immortalized in the Gazette He was adopted  into the sacred sixteen levees assemblies coffeehouses all agreed and they were certainly right that if every Governor had acted with the spirit of Lord Dunmore we must have established our dominion in all the other Provinces as perfectly as we had done in Virginia  His Lordship had the honour of being the first Governor who thought it necessary to quit his government and take refuge on board his Majesty's fleet His Lordship at length abandoned to the mercy of their masters the wretched negroes that remained alive out of the whom his promises and proclamations had engaged to join the ministerial part and with a few people in a starved condition fled his province    In the midst of all the joy that arose from such important victories as Lord Dunmore's so amply displayed an odd sort of an account arrived A very brave officer as brave and as intelligent an officer as any in the King's service Major Fordyce with a detachment of our best grenadiers was sent by this heroic Commander Lord Dunmore upon a wellplanned expedition to which there were but two small objections One that it was perfectly impracticable the other that if it did succeed it could be of no kind of use Accordingly Major Fordyce was killed The party was defeated all the grenadiers slain or made prisonersWhat said the lately communicative Gazette Not a syllable The Secretary of State had wasted his stock of eloquence in his Panegyric on Lord Dunmore He had nothing  left for the funeral oration of Fordyce He was as silent as the grave in which that gallant officer and his brave soldiers were laid And where was the necessity for much discourse The man was dead and what did it signify to put ourselves into an ill humour about what we could not possibly help  This Virginian history is an instance of the diffused stile of the Gazette contrasted with the opposite extreme of excellencethe expressive and eloquent silence The instances of a less violent but equally judicious contrast are frequent and happily mixed in I will endeavour to recall them to the reader's memory Without such a retrospect it will not be easy to enter into the true spirit of this exquisite politicoliterary performance which is now the sole source of authentic intelligence and the only vehicle of our summer's delight and information  Vide Gazette December  When the forts of St John and Chamblé were taken by the Provincials and upwards of regular troops made prisoners there was a demand for the compact close laconic style The Gazette did not altogether omit these events but with a wonderful energy and brevity related them in much fewer lines than the shortest article of the capitulation by which those unhappy troops  had surrendered prisoners of war Of cannon and stores not one word These were left to the imagination of the reader All accounts of the taking of cannon in the explicit stile belonged exclusively to Lord Dunmore  We may remember too that when Arnold made the astonishing march which will for ever immortalize his name the Gazette was not absolutely silent It gave to merit  one honest line  and in the laconic brevity of Lord George Germain  "  one  Arnold appeared at Point Levi  Vide Gazette December  "  Of the taking of Montreal which place with the whole strength of England and America conjoined had formerly given glory and Peerage to Lord Amherston the part of the Gazette SILENCECol Prescot his ships his soldiers his stores taken afterwardsSILENCE  This uniformity of silence however prudent and even chastly eloquent might seem rather dull and at length begin to disgust People might learn an ugly habit of looking elsewhere for intelligence In this distress an event happened which justified the drawing up the floodgate and letting out all that flow of eloquence which had been so long dammed in  Montgomery  an obscure man of whom we had heard  nothing  before  from authority  was killed at Quebec and  his troops repulsed But unfortunately even on this fairest of all occasions we were again sadly at a loss This happy opportunity was in danger of being wholly thrown away The question arose where is the authority for this good news The conquering General was too closely blocked up to send a messenger of the decisive victory he had obtained To take intelligence from the Philadelphia news papers and to put at the foot of the account  "  Charles Thompson  "  not our  Sir  Charles and  "  by order of the Congress  "  was too much In effect it was to register a rebellious libel among the consecrated records of office This was hard undoubtedly  The difficulty staggered the American Secretary of State In an hurry a council is called The Attorney General in his firm sturdy direct way objected to the measure He relied on it that such a step might teach people to put some trust in rebellious publications and would besides totally take away the best and sometimes only excuse we had for our prudent reserve on most of our defeats viz that we had them only from the narrative of the rebels This had some weight But Mr Weddurburne whose  forte  is dexterity and refinement observed that the Congress as they are a raw new government and to that time unacquainted with disgraces had  not learned the art of glossing a misfortune but had delivered  "a plain round unvarnished tale"  of their defeat This advantage is not to be missed Here said Mr Wedderburne we may dilate at the expence of an enemy The narrative as far as it goes is their own and our imagination is at liberty to add full enough on this foundation We cloath ourselves with the spoils of the enemy We may dress ourselves  "  à la Congrèss  "  Danaum{que} insignia nobis  Aptemus dolus an virtus quis in hoste requirit  Lord George carried it for his friend the Solicitor's opinion The Philadelphia Congress Gazette supplied the materials for our's and here but at their expence we expatiated again The stunted Gazette once more shot out into a full luxuriance of narrative  This mode however of borrowing an enemy's account is too ticklish to be adopted as a regular practice Then came in the great delicate point in all human affairs  "to know when to leave off"  For unluckily those exotic Congress Newspapers began to shoot out some things that would not bear transplanting and were not at all adapted to flourish in the soil of the London Gazette  The taking for instance of Brigadier General Macdonald in North Carolinathe killing Colonel Macleodthe defeat of of our Highland troops and the disarming of the whole partyalthough all undeniably truewas not proper stuff for a London GazetteThe expedition of General Schuyler into the Indian country although equally certainthe capitulation of Sir John Johnsonthe making him a prisoner on parolethe submission and laying down their arms by of our loyal subjects Scots and Tories and the compelling some of our natural allies the humane Savages of the Five Nations to lay down the hatchetthese accounts one sees at first sight could by no art be made fitting for the Gazette Of these therefore nothing was said  The end of writing is  et prodesse et delectare  In a paper where the profit of Ministers and the delight of the people were to be the great objects it would be a piece of downright absurdity to mention such things as cannot possibly tell to the advantage of the one of the parties or afford any sort of satisfaction to either of them  Mr Miller I find it impossible to do justice to the merits of Ministers as Historians of their own exploits in a single paper The subject grows upon me as the matter rises in dignity and importance Reserving therefore the inimitable  beauties of the Boston narrative to another time I shall for the present satisfy myself with remarking that the naval part of the war though probably it comes from another quarter is related on the same principle and with no less perfection than that which is carried on upon the  Terra firma  One of our men of war returns home rather in a shabby condition But what does she come home for In reality to bring the news of her own escape from the Americans Since our affairs are in that pleasant situation that retreats are  happy shiftings of position  and that escapes are to take rank as victories it becomes necessary to display this eminent advantage at full length and it is accordingly related at large in the true technical style and with all the elegant perspicuity of the nautical dialect The Gazette so lately on the reserve here becomes prodigal of information We have on the escape of the Glasgow for the first time an account of Commodore Hopkins's squadron the number of vessels the number of guns the number of men an account as exact as if we were furnished with it from the Navy Office of Philadelphia The state of the British Navy was refused on the motion of a Marine officer in Parliament last session Amends are now made by a precise detail given gratis of one of the American Fleets We have the satisfaction  to find that this navy is in shoal water but safe enough in New England In the late war the escape of one of our stout frigates built and furnished for war from a little squadron consisting of a decayed merchantman with a sloop and schooner or two hastily and ill fitted into privateers would scarce have deserved a long laboured account in the Gazette But things are altered Mr Pitt  was  Lord George Germaine  is  Secretary of State  In this last piece we are furnished at one and the same time with a curious example of the various excellencies of the full display and of the judicious reserve The Gazette which knows so minutely every gun in Hopkins's fleet and its weight of metal says nothing at all of this fellow's carrying his convoy and the military stores with which he was heavily laden safely to the place of their destination Nor does it know that he had taken a transport and tender in his Majesty's service It even omits a piece of good fortune of the Glasgow whose shot in the very first broadside damaged Hopkins's rudder in such a manner that his ship lay for two hours incapable of pursuit or fight  To compleat this account of the American Regatta made for our special amusement by the same use of light and shade in the narrative we are informed that a great number of ships and  vessels  have been taken By this judicious choice of terms the number is as effectually swelled by the seizure of a cock boat as by the taking of the largest ship that ever sailed in the Virginia trade  As to captures made on the part of the Americans we might conclude from the prudent silence of the Gazette that there were absolutely none If it were not for an impertinent telltale in the city called Lloyd's List who in all good policy ought to be silenced we should never have guessed that above FIFTY transport ships had been taken by the Americans  The number has since been very much increased the Portugal trade has suffered not a little and the Newfoundland trade has not escaped these rebellious privateers take our ships upon our own coast  the ships themselves exclusive of the cargoes of as much value at least as the whole of the prizes taken from the Americans  In a word whether by land or sea we are scarcely intitled from  authority  to believe that one misfortune has happened in the whole war All is Glory Success and Victory Yet Thirteen Provinces are lost  VALENS  LETTER XIII  SHIFTING OF POSITION  Thursday July  MR MILLER  THE emission of authorised newspapers is an homage paid by the most despotic powers to public opinion By the sending abroad Gazettes they tacitly but fully admit two very material points First the right of the people to be informed of the state of national affairs Secondly the influence of popular judgement on their own fortune They know it would be an enterprise too desperate to think of keeping the people wholly in the dark  We are apt to entertain rather too mean an opinion of the spirit and understanding of our neighbours There is not a nation in Europe so servilely passive as to abandon all concern about its own welfare and to give a credit absolutely unlimited  to its administration It is true that the people under despotic governments have it not in their power to take a  legal  vengeance on those who abuse their trust or to remove those who shew themselves unequal to it This is the grand defect of their scheme of government But nature sometimes supplies the place of law and their illegal sensibility frequently takes a severe vengeance on those who confiding in the weakness and imperfection of the constitution of their country presume to act in violation of the spirit of all laws Even when such a people are not able to punish an unskilful state actor their voice is generally sufficient to explode and hiss him from the public stage  We have seen not long ago that the same King of Spain who with an high hand protected promoted honoured and rewarded Don Francisco Bucarelli although he was impeached of high crimes and misdemeanors even from the throne of Great Britain itself was obliged to dismiss and banish the Marquis of Squillace his Favourite and Prime Minister to appease the discontents of the people of Madrid The same King was but the other day obliged on account of the displeasure of his subjects to dismiss and remove from Court the Condé O'Reilly a Minister and a  General high in his favour upon his failure in an enterprize against Algiers  The King of France on the discontent of a part of his people and the ill success of some financial projects dismissed Monsieur Turgot as he had raised that Minister to gratify the opinion of his subjects  Ministers in other countries finding themselves obliged to humble their pride before their necessities do not venture to keep all information from the people On the contrary they affect to supply them with it very liberally and very honestly Possessed of the only source of authentic intelligence they indeed gloss and varnish but never attempt grosly to misrepresent much less wholly to conceal Even at Constantinople the Minister stands in awe of public opinion Not having a press there the government keeps in its pay a set of walking Gazettes somewhat like our Court runners who mount on a stool in Coffeehouses and entertain their grave turban'd hearers with an account of the designs of the Court of Petersburgh or the progress of the rebellion in Egypt  As a nation declining from greatness is the most mean and a people sinking from freedom are the most eminently servile our Ministers think this is a fit season for an experiment to find out the  maximum  of human patience submission and  passiveobedience Their proceedings in the Gazette with regard to the late war in NewEngland shew what progress they have made in that experiment  From the begining of our present troubles our hopes and fears were all engaged at Boston This was the heart and vital spring of all disorder It was not so much the metropolis of America as the headquarters of rebellion Boston accordingly became the object of all our civil regulations for several sessions and of all our military operations for two years together Our eyes were never a moment turned from it Expectation panted on every Western breezewhen the Gazette suddenly announced to a longing and anxious people that General Howe had  taken a resolution  to evacuate Boston and was actually on his way to Halifax Habituated as we are to every thing extraordinary the easy brevity of this account did excite some degree of surprise There was nothing in it which could give you the least idea of war or warlike operations It was delivered with as easy and careless an air as if the story was nothing more than that a corps had changed their country quarters just as if General Howe's regiment had shifted their quarters from Boston in Lincolnshire to Halifax in Yorkshire And this is all the satisfaction that the nation has ever  yet received for six millions expended and the last town in thirteen Provinces lost  Lord George Germain's experiment on the temper of the people of England was made and it answered This proud and jealous nation bore that treatment with a patience that would have shamed the hired credulity of contented cuckoldom Those who would have imposed Ovid's Metamorphoses for articles of faith never presumed so much upon the weakness of the human understanding A more perfect passiveobedience was never preached by interested priests for the practice of the credulous laity A Turk blinded with the smoke of tobacco and dozed with opium would have pushed his live Gazette from his stool and kicked him out of the Coffeehouse if he had dared to give this account of the evacuation of Ockzakow or Bender Even the foreign Gazettes skilled and practised as they are in the trade and mystery of intelligence stood in astonishment at the bold push of their dear brother of Whitehall and publicly avowed their amazement at this new political phaenomenon  Vide Hague Gazette  That noble and venerable body in which a Minister of State  The Earl of Sandwich the First Lord of the Admiralty  lately boasted that he had concealed from them and from his own colleagues  the true state of their affairs lest they should be slow in entering into a civil war they of course desired to know nothing They looked on the proceedings of their Minister as on the feats of Mr Breslaw in which a knowledge of the slight would only spoil their pleasure in the deception Both Houses are coolly and deliberately acting their part in this great work Declaring themselves totally indifferent about every part of public duty and even destitute of common human feelings they are preparing to make their country as indifferent about the existence of Parliament itself Several worthy and diligent Members already shew themselves heartily tired of parliamentary attendance They imagine that with  their  talents they might  get  as much under any other form of government as under this with an attendance less fatiguing and a far lighter expence They think a Minister's levee room has as wholesome an air as St Stephen's chapel and that the domestics of a Court Favourite are a cheaper object of bribery and full as worthy an object of adulation as the scot and lot of a venal borough Perhaps they may be in the right  On occasion of this real  Gazette Extraordinary  the Earl of Suffolk one of his Majesty's principal Secretaries of State discovered some marks of good breeding though he does not come quite  up to all the graces which Lord Chesterfield requires as qualifications to office He has I suppose some remains of complaisance to that minority in which he made so flaming a protest against his present associates In condescension to the weakness of the Lords in opposition he submitted to tell them the reason why he told them nothing He lamented in the most pathetic strains to his noble audience the necessity he was under of not producing any part of General Howe's letter for he said "the account of the retreat was so mixed with matters that went before and operations which were to follow after very improper to be publicly known that he could not possibly disentangle them and that thus he was disabled from doing justice to the incomparable merits of the General who had made so happy  "  a shifting of position  "  Every thing has its place and in the House of Lords  this  gave satisfaction We the rabble below the bar however thought it odd that what had passed  before  General Howe's retreat should be concealed from us since it could never have been concealed from the enemy Perhaps what went  before  might be the cause of the retreat that followed  after  If indeed this preceding cause should consist in some batteries too fierce to be borne and too strong to be forced this I admit  was a good reason for concealment We ought not to know that the rebels have any cannon since Lord Dunmore seized all their artillery or that they know how to erect batteries or that they have courage to defend them  The other part of the reason for concealing the account of General Howe's retreat I must beg leave to observe is not quite so honourable to the clearness of head of that General or demonstrates so fully as one could wish the calm situation of one who makes an undisturbed retreat So perplexed and involved if we believe Lord Suffolk was General Howe's account that the Secretary of State's office in full practice of garbling papers for the diversion of Parliament was not able to unravel the complicated texture of the commentaries of our American Caesar or to give one particular of his proceedings for several months to the hour of his departure without disclosing all the secrets of the coming campaign  With all due deference to my Lord Suffolk I do not believe so ill of the abilities either of General Howe or of his Lordship I can never believe the alledged confusion of General Howe's ideas to be the real reason for concealing from us every single circumstance of his precipitate dereliction of the precious purchase of millions His Lordship told the Peers that this confusion disabled  him from doing justice to General Howe's merits Under favour there was no question of that General's merits We are very sure that  He  did his duty and that He gave an account of it naturally and clearly This concealment was never for his sake or the sake of his operations But for whatever purpose this account of Lord Suffolk's was given it could answer no rational end If we could believe this account the friends of the war would be obliged to entertain but gloomy hopes of its future success Partial as they are to the authors of civil contention they must condemn the Minister for committing the fortune of their pious quarrel into such hands To admit their plea in the justification of their Gazette is to find a verdict against the wisdom of their Cabinet  No sooner had that Gazette notified to us that General Howe had  taken this resolution  than we were entertained with verbal comments upon it more curious than the original text The Ministry assumed a face of joy equal to that which would have attended the most decisive victory As soon as Boston was evacuated Boston at once changed its nature It no longer stood under the same parallel of latitude It then became the worst chosen spot on the whole continent for the operations of war We were too happy in getting  rid of it The Americans were anew charged with cowardice for letting us escape The Lords publicly congratulated each other on having shaken off so intolerable a yoke  In this exultation they forgot one trifling circumstance which somewhat regards their credit for the present and may perhaps a little affect their safety on some future day of account Suppose a spirit of enquiry should arise and it should be asked who were they who brought his Majesty's army into a place from whence it was a triumph to escape If Boston was not a spot worth holding for its own sake or for its convenience for other operations why did the troops continue there for near two years Why were they reinforced day after day and regiment after regiment for the defence of that place until they amounted to upwards of men Why were four Generals sent to command them Why was the Ordnance Office emptied to defend Boston Why was the sinking fund swallowed up only by its military  extraordinaries  which amounted to upwards of l Why were ton of transports employed in that service Why was this nation almost starved to feed that town Why was a fleet commanded by a succession of British Admirals and at an incredible expence stationed in its harbour Why was so much brave blood shed  at Bunker'sHill to prevent its being insulted Every shilling spent at Boston is a peculation of public money every life lost there is a cruel murder if Boston was not a place worth preserving To exhaust yourself in defence of an object that is not worth having or not to take sufficient means of defending an object of real value are both of them crimes If there be any difference the first crime is the worst as it is worse wholly to mistake the end than to miscalculate the means It is however for this capital blunder that the Ministers claim the applauses of their country According to this rule the merit of our Generals is to escape from the place where the providence of our Ministers had stationed them no hopes are entertained by themselves of the war if all its plans are not wholly reversed in the execution  Such is the case on their own representation which is worse than the most malignant adversary could have stated it But as they are poor in counsel the Court must not record the plea General Howe did not abandon Boston because it was a place ill fitted and never went to Halifax because it was a place well fitted for a center of military operations The Ministers of the Gazette suppose we know nothing of American geography when we are told that in order to direct  his operations on the  middle  colonies General Howe fled to the very extremity of the  northern  It is neither more nor less than to tell us that a General in London who intended to attack Dover Castle would find it his best way thither to march his troops from hence to Edinburgh  I was at first at a loss to know how the Ministry could give into this apparently insolent and unfeeling discourse How they could think to glory in their shame and to defend themselves by the very circumstances which aggravate their offence But on putting things together it may be accounted for It was to prepare the minds of the people for the events which in spite of any favour of fortune must inevitably follow from the course they have pursued They have told the public that Boston was worth nothing because they were not able to keep it and had no hopes of recovering it If they find that the nation can be persuaded to make violent efforts on a supposition of the value of the object and then to take comfort on their failure from a consideration of its insignificance all they wish is effected They have already by many speeches and publications concerning the Colonies been preparing the public for the loss of the whole They are already spreading with infinite diligence an opinion that extensive empire is mischievous and that the vast acquisitions  in the east and west corrupt our minds and weaken our industry  This is the consolation they hoard up for us against the day of our bitter distress when we shall have undone ourselves in an attempt to ruin our countrymen Stripped of her dependencies the nakedness of England is to be covered with the tattered cloak of a compelled beggarly Cynic philosophy The loss of glory and dominion are to be compensated by dull commonplace observations on the instability of empire and the emptiness of all human honours Our Ministers of State are preparing themselves to become ministers of the church and to preach patience and resignation to a tractable auditory reduced at length to a real Christian humility and to a true poverty of purse and of spirit by the salutary operation of their councils  Hitherto they have done every thing to bring us to the state for which they are preparing us But if the events of war should belye their plans and if the bravery of General Heister and his Hessian troops should recover what British valour under the direction of our Ministers could not keep it is then that in their success the mischief and weakness of their plans will appear in full lustre The sunshine of fortune will only display in a glare of light the inanity of the object for which the Ministry and their German troops are contending  The Colonies in all the submission of disaster and defeat will prove full as unfruitful of the revenue for which we are at war and which alone can pay for that war as the same colonies in all the heighth and insolence of successful resistance Then it will appear that the Ministry and their runners were not idly employed when they told us the Colonies are of no advantage to this country This will be the event when Lord George Sackville's Gazette shall have satiated us with the pompous narrative of the victories obtained by the troops of the Duke of Brunswick disciplined by Prince Ferdinand over the miserable English on the other side of the water  Until that glorious day announced with such singular propriety arrives when the Gazette shall flow in as copious streams as the Weser or the Elbe its scanty current continues to be directed so as to fructify the proper plants and to starve the rest In my last paper I remarked on the manner in which the Secretary's Office communicates and witholds intelligence They profit of my praises and so encouraged they persevere religiously in the plan for which I had commended them  In the Gazette of the th of last month Lord George copies the best of examples himself In the last war the captures of merchant  ships was never the food of the Gazette But now a Secretary of State serves up an account of the taking of ships and  vessels  of the rebels exactly on the principles I stated in my last letter but not a word of the transport loaded with arms and ammunition that these rebels have taken  His Lordship has on the same principles carefully avoided all mention of the arrival of Sir Peter Parker and Lord Cornwallis at Cape Fear although he has certainly received an account of that event and although it might be thought that the public would feel some degree of anxiety concerning the fate of so great a fleet and army which had been considered as lost The production of the  credit  side of the account of  captures  with the total silence on the important expedition of Sir Peter Parker and Lord Cornwallies shews that the Minister considers the whole people of this once great country as the mercenary inhabitants of some little sea port some nest of fishermen smugglers and pirates such as Dunkirk St Sebastian the Isle of Providence or any other dirty hole at home or abroad where they are in high spirits on hearing of the arrival of some miserable plunder but are totally indifferent to all the great and important operations of war It must give the Minister heartfelt pleasure if they should find that the spirit of the late act for animating  the exertions of the navy by the holding out the plunder of their fellow citizens is grown as diffusive as they could wish that the whole nation feel in the same way If this should be the case one act of theirs has not been made in vain  VALENS  LETTER XIV  PROSPECT from SUCCESS  Tuesday Nov  MR MILLER  IT is now the third winter since the commencement of the present natural and auspicious war against our Colonies It is I think so long since General Gage was sent to Boston with a fleet and army together with a heavy train of artillery formed of the welltempered metal of those sound Acts of Parliament which were to batter down all resistance to the authority of British Government For the greatest part of that period our expences were continually on the increase and our hopes continually on the wane At length news arrives as unexpected as it is satisfactorythat Hessian and British troops with the aid of a squadron of men of war  had surprised Provincials out of their intrenchments turned their flanks and thrown them into confusion on which their lines are abandoned and the city of NewYork left exposed and untenable  This news arrives in the very nick of time as if it had been bespoke It is done to a turn It came just at the meeting of Parliament Without it Ministry had been sadly at a loss Without this victory the expulsion from Boston the repulse at CharlesTown and the petty defeats in almost every creek and harbour of NorthAmerica together with the capture of so many valuable merchantmen in the seas of the WestIndies and even of Europe would have furnished more suitable matter for an impeachment of Ministers than a speech from the throne  I have heard that as this news did not arrive early in the season the speech as first prepared was as in reason it ought written in a very different style from the present The expressions were at least as gracious to the English subject here and the epithets not nearly so high seasoned with regard to those on the other side of the great water There was not a word of treason in it It expressed according to report  some  disposition to concede and reconcile of which this speech shews no signs at all But on the whole  it was as fine a performance in the tender and pathetic style as the present is in the grand and lofty It is a pity we are not favoured with the first sketch for Ministers like poets  Lose half the praise they would have got  Were it but known what they discrectly blot  Victory has deprived us for ever of that fine composition It has however made full amends This victory and the effect of it is most happily and ably described in the present not evasive and hypocritical but clear and ingenuous as well as most gracious humane and merciful oration  "The success in that province says the speech has been so  important  as to give  the strongest hopes  of the  most decisive good consequences  "  I suppose the royal and noble authors of this finished performance are so intent on enforcing the laws of the land that they quite forget those of grammar and are so eager about breaking stubborn heads that in their hurry they mistake Priscian for Yankee I therefore make no remarks on the construction of this sentence I am carried away by the higher beauties of the performance I am sensible that it was fashioned on the principles of the sciences now in the greatest estimation Writers have done much for gardening Gardening again has paid its tribute to literary composition  This rural science even Kings do not disdain to cultivate One of the leading principles in this modish gardening is as Pope expresses it  "Decently to hide"  All must not come upon us at once We are to be on the very edge of the skulking  haha  and ready to tumble into it before we are to be put on our guard This the rules of the art require and the principle is transplanted into the speech Had that speech bluntly and plainly told us that the action was decisive the terms would be well enough understood that is decisive of the fortune of war but then observe the judgment the main point would be lost For we should immediately begin to think of enjoying the revenue of the conquered country and of some sort of oeconomy in regard to our own On the other hand had the Ministry who are equally communicative through their goodness and reserved through their wisdom held out no hopes at all of an end to that business this nation would hardly be persuaded to go on this journey with her usual alacrity But here we have a new phrase to express a new situationWhat  "  an hope of decisive good consequences  "  means I do not perfectly understand though the words are brave words and certainly very pleasing because hope  decision and good consequences are always agreeable sounds to welltuned ears let them be placed or connected in what manner they may What the good consequences arewhen they will probably happenfrom whence they are to ariseor how far they are to extend we know not All this lies wrapt in clouds and darkness  But for this obscurity we are soon made ample amends and the whole is cleared up in the next sentence We lost sight of the building in the mazes of the serpentine walk but we catch it again in a very agreeable manner it breaks in upon us with double effect  "But notwithstanding this  fair prospect  says the speech we must at all events prepare for  another  campaign"  Thus the riddle of the  "  decisive good consequences  "  is solved It signifies neither more nor less than this that we are in an happy train of spending twenty millions this year in addition to the fifteen millions which we spent in the last I heartily congratulate the Ministry and my country on those  strong hopes  and those  decisive good consequences  If defeat entitled us to spend fifteen millions it is certainly reasonable that victory as it is more worth should be more expensive This is indeed at length distinctly promised though in terms rather unusual  "  This important consideration  will necessarily be  followed with  great expence  "  With submis+sion I fear that all the  great expence  incurred and likely to be incurred has arisen from  want  consideration  The next paragraph of the speech is full of hopes too It has likewise its windings and mazes  "The assurances of amity from the several Courts of Europe"  are not it seems now for the first time givenbut his Majesty  "  continues  to receive them"  You would naturally expect in consequence of this uniformity of faithful assurances that his Majesty's mind still rested in the same perfect repose it has hitherto enjoyed on that soft cushion of state from the beginning of these troubles From these assurances nobody living I am persuaded could expect the conclusion which comes on you like a stroke of thunder  "  that it is expedient in the  present situation of affairs  that we should be in a respectable  state of defence at home"  It seems then that the effect of  royal  assurances I mean from abroad is to lessen confidence in the direct ratio of their continuance When I read this I was immediately put in mind of the good old adage  "Multa levant promissa fidem"  Which I never saw so thoroughly exemplified before  In this part of the speech we discover a second point perfectly worthy the congratulations which our gracious Sovereign has condescended to make to his obedient people namelythat we are likely to have a Spanish and French war to enliven the dull uniformity of our civil dissentions"  Such an event we were told last year was absolutely impossible and what is very remarkable it was expressly said to be impossible  then  for the very reasons given for apprehending it in the speech of this year that is from the tendency of the success of America to unsettle the  system of Europe  If I perfectly understand the expression in the speech it means that the success of the Americans would encourage the colonies of other nations to rebel Our rulers therefore last year concluded it impossible that those nations should give them encouragement Be this as it may we know that the impossibility of last year on the principles assigned in the speech of this year has already cost to our constitution two illegal embargoes to our credit an heavy fall of stock and to our finances it will be immediately followed by an augmentation of  Only for the present  seamen a call of the militia an increase of the standing army These are some of the  decisive good consequences  of "  continuing to receive assurances of  amity from the several foreign Courts and of a favourite and popular  civil war in which possibility and impossibility hope and fear loss or gain victory and defeat all alike as rays from every part of a vast circumference tend to a common centre meeting in this one pointPublic Bankruptcy  I believe that those who have addressed so dutifully and prayed so charitably for the blessing of an American war hardly insisted on this European war into the bargain even with all its  decisive good consequences  But a gracious and bountiful Ministry always gives heaped measure Perhaps the addressers though they so chearfully voted lives and fortunes did not absolutely insist upon giving near a million sterling of their trading property in order to nurse to maturity the infant naval power of the Colonies though  after  the loss the captures have I admit given the Admiralty an opportunity of displaying its vigilance and  soresight  in providing convoys Another advantage not within the stipulation and which is given to the addressers of free grace and bounty is the rise of insurance on the trade which amounts to a prodigious sum and is therefore to all intents and purposes a  tax  to that amount on the commercial property of England  I do not know whether the slaughters that have been made and suffered in many parts of America and the burthens which have been imposed  or are in a course of being imposed at home are sufficient to satisfy us I remember it was the language of last year in excuse for not offering terms to North America that we could not make peace with dignity until we had given our colonies some heavy blow Is not this blow of NewYork heavy enough for our dignity We have already sacrificed many millions of our own treasure a good many lives of the  insular English  and at one stroke about of the  Continental English  to that fierce CourtGod Dignity Is the season not yet arrived when we are to give some attention to that humble houshold God  SelfInterest  But we are  "at all events to prepare for  another  campaign"  We do not quite forget that when regular troops and an hundred ships of force and such an artillery as never was employed in any foreign war were sent last year to America all this vast power and expence was said to be employed in order to prevent hostilities from being drawn out into length and to finish the war in  another  campaign But that  second another  is we see to produce  a third another  and thus as our poet says  "Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow  "Creeps on his petty pace from day to day  "To the last syllable of recorded time  "And all our yesterdays have lighted fools  "The way to dusty death"  And thus shall we war on till after irreparable injuries done and received we shall from mere weariness and fatigue fall back to the miserable vexatious and precarious state of peace without reconciliation  I will suppose America  laid at Lord North's feet  and reduced to Lord George Germaine's  "  unconditioned submission  "  yet without the formal establishment of liberty to satisfy and content or the formal establishment of slavery in its instrument a mercenary army to awe and terrify do you seriously my countrymen Whigs or Tories as you may be do you seriously expect a continuance of obedience  There has been a great victory at Long Island Many English were butchered by the Hessians after they had laid down their arms This it seems was proper and was justified by the law of arms and shews that a rabble of freemen are not to trifle with Hessian spirit and resentment Col Balfour has brought an account of the taking of the uninhabited walls of New York which were snatched half burnt from the fire Has he brought any account of any thing like a movement towards a general submission in all the Colonies or even in any one of them Very far  from it The Hessians must justifiably slaughter more men in cold blood your people must abandon and in despair burn more of their towns there must be more mutual rapine of the property of English on English Thus we must go onFor what To establish a standing army in America for our ruin in order to furnish Commissions to the younger Adelphi of antient decayed Northern Families It can be for nothing else for I do not believe that any one man living has the folly to imagine that all the taxes to be drawn from America for a century together will even pay for the repair of New York so as to fit it for its only purpose a barrack for General Heister's and General Howe's army  The case in short is this Our war for taxation in America has not yet and never will produce a revenue  America is not taxed  but  England is  America is impoverished undone if you please but England is not enriched The Colonies have now avowed independence I have ever said and I think shewn in my former letters that it was in no sort their original intention in this contest but that they would infallibly be driven to it by the measures of violence hotly and obstinately pursued and by the rejection with the same intemperate pertinacity of every means of reconciliation But one phrase  serves for all reasons  "They have avowed independency"  They have so and is it because America has avowed independency that England must be ruined can we be quite certain that the offer of terms of liberty which will cost us nothing will not draw them from that independency when we are sure that offers of slavery which have cost us millions have driven them to it  It would in my opinion be wise to seize this first moment of success to do proudly what long since we ought to have done wiselyTo repeal the obnoxious actsTo put things on the footing they stood on in To unite this country and to give a justification to your friends in America for adhering to the free and reasonable dependence of that country on thisThis salutary and wholesome end is not to be effected by evasion and chicane  "  Means of conciliation  "  Which makes such a figure in the speech  one of the new invented phrases that aims to convey a sense which facts will not support It would convey to the reader that terms and conditions of reconciliation have been rejected by the Americans It is a truth now universally notorious that no terms have been offered to them Lord George Germaine at the end of last session positively and justly declared that the commission  neither had nor could have powers of giving other terms of peace except those of pardon on the laying down their arms It carried simply the power of accepting  "unconditioned submission"  In the dialect of ministers this is  means of conciliation  in the language of common sense it is a declaration of an eternal war But to make peace terms and conditions must be held out and to satisfy our grand idea of dignity they ought to be held now in this first moment of success For can we affirm that war however successful is not liable to reverses of fortune No man can say where a spark may arise from the apparently extinguished fire of revolt and insurrection  In the beginning of these troubles the majority in both Houses have not been ashamed to vote the rebellion in America as confined to one spot when the very same distemper whatever it was raged over the whole continent This was done to instigate a civil war why should they be ashamed of a similar finesse to restore domestic peace at a time too when we are threatened with the hostility of foreign powers Let them now vote that all America is subdued and to a people conquered graciously bestow  "the blessings of peace and the security of liberty"  The success real or pretended may if they  please be made the preamble to the act of repeal and settlement  If war be not exempt from mutability even in this hitherto single handed war with our Colonies alone what will be the consequences of an unfavourable turn in a war with France and Spain united I would not therefore put my  whole  trust in war so as to neglect every thing else lest agreeably to the ministerial prognostic tho' I am far from presuming to adopt the lofty tone of the epithets so becoming them but so little becoming me  "if their treason be suffered to take root much mischief  must  grow from it to the safety of the loyal Coloniesto the commerce of these kingdomsand indeed to the present system of all Europe"  May treason since this revolt must be so never take root from the continuance of tyrannyThis is my prayer My Lords the Bishops will hardly find a better in their form for the fast  You will not be farther troubled on these American affairs by your humble servant and his country's true disinterested and uninfluenced friend  VALENS  BOOKS printed for J ALMON opposite BURLINGTONHOUSE in
