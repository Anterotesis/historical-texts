STUDIA ATQUE OMNES DELICIAS ANIMI  NOTESCATQUE MAGIS MORTUUS ATQUE MAGIS  CATULLUS  LONDON PRINTED for J DODSLEY in PALLMALL  M DCC LXXX  EPISTLE c  IN vain dear Monitor thy kind desire  To wake the embers of poetic fire  To clear the mind where Grief's dark shadows lower  And Fancy dies by Sorrow's freezing power  In vain would Friendship's chearing voice suggest  Her flattering visions to the Poet's breast  That public favor calls with just demand  Th' expected volume from his lingering hand  Lost are those anxious hopes that eager pride  With thee my THORNTON they declin'd they died  Friend of my opening soul whose love began  To hail thy Poet ere he rank'd as man  Whose praise like dewdrops which the early morn  Sheds with mild virtue on the vernal thorn  Taught his young mind each swell of thought to shew  And gave the germs of fancy strength to blow  Dear firm associate of his studious hour  Who led his idler step to Learning's bower  Tho' young imparting to his giddier youth  Thy thirst of science and thy zeal for truth  Ye towers of Granta where our friendship grew  And that pure mind expanded to my view  Our love fraternal let thy walls attest  Where Attic joys our letter'd evening blest  Where midnight from the chains of sleep reliev'd  Stole on our social studies unperceiv'd  But not my THORNTON in that calm alone  Was thy mild genius thy warm virtue known  When manhood mark'd the hour for busy strife  And led us to the crowded maze of life  From whence to sweet retirement's soothing shade  Love and the Muse thy willing friend convey'd  Thy soul more firm to join the struggling crowd  To nobler Themis toilsome homage vow'd  With zeal devoting to her sacred throne  A heart as uncorrupted as her own  Still as thy mind with manly powers endued  The opening path of active life pursued  And round the ripening field of business rang'd  Thy heart unwarp'd unharden'd unestrang'd  To early friendship still retain'd its truth  With all the warm integrity of youth  Whene'er affliction's force thy friend opprest  Thou wer't the rock on which his cares might rest  From thy kind words his rising hopes would own  The charm of reason in affection's tone  Where is the soothing voice of equal power  To take it's anguish from the present hour  Beneath the pressure of a grief so just  The lenient aid of books in vain I trust  They that could once the war of thought controul  And banish discord from the jarring soul  Now irritate the mind they used to heal  They speak too loudly of the loss I feel  Thou faithful censor of the Poet's strain  No more shalt thou his sinking hope sustain  No more with ardent zeal's enlivening fire  Call from inglorious shades his silent lyre  No more as in our days of pleasure past  The eye of judgment o'er his labors cast  Keen to discern the blemishes that lurk  In the loose texture of his growing work  Eager to praise yet resolute to blame  Kind to his verse but kinder to his fame  How may the Muse who prosper'd by thy care  Now meet the public eye without despair  Now if harsh censures on her failings pour  Her warmest advocate can speak no more  Cold are those lips which breath'd the kind defence  If spleen's proud cavil strain'd her tortur'd sense  Which bade her song to public praise aspire  And call'd attention to her trembling lyre  Ah could she now thus petrified with grief  Find in some lighter lay a vain relief  Still must she deem such verse if such could be  A wound to friendship and a crime to thee  Profanely utter'd at this sacred time  When thy pale corse demands her plaintive rhime  And Virtue weeping whom she could not save  Calls the just mourner to thy recent grave  Hail hallow'd vault whose darksome caverns hold  A frame though mortal of no common mould  A heart scarce sullied with a human flaw  Which shun'd no duty and transgress'd no law  In joy still guarded in distress serene  Thro' life a model of the golden mean  Which friendship only led him to transgress  Whose purer spirit sanctifies excess  Pure mind whose meekness in thy mortal days  Pursuing virtue still retir'd from praise  Nor wish'd that friendship should on marble give  That perfect image of thy worth to live  Which 'twas thy aim alone to leave imprest  On the close tablet of her faithful breast  If now her verse against thy wish rebel  And strive to blazon what she lov'd so well  Forgive the tender thought the moral song  Which would thy virtues to the world prolong  That rescued from the grave's oblivious shade  Their useful lustre may be still survey'd  Dear to the pensive eye of fond regret  As light still beaming from a sun that's set  Oft to our giddy Muse thy voice has taught  The just ambition of poetic thought  Bid her bold view to latest time extend  And strive to make futurity her friend  If any verse her little art can frame  May win the partial voice of distant fame  Be it the verse whose fond ambition tries  To paint thy mind in truth's unfading dyes  Tho' firm yet tender ardent yet refin'd  With Roman strength and Attic grace combin'd  What tho' undeck'd with titles power and wealth  Great were thy generous deeds and done by stealth  For thy pure bounty from observance stole  Nor wish'd applause but from thy conscious soul  Tho' thy plain tomb no sculptur'd form may shew  No boastful witness of suspected woe  Yet heavenly shapes that shun the glare of day  To that dear spot shall nightly visits pay  Pale Science there shall o'er her votary strew  Her flow'rs yet moist with sorrow's recent dew  There Charity Compassion's lovely child  In rustic notes pathetically wild  With grateful blessings bid thy name endure  And mourn the patron of her villagepoor  E'en from the midnight shew with music gay  The soul of Beauty to thy tomb shall stray  In sweet distraction steal from present mirth  To sigh unnotic'd o'er the hallow'd earth  Which hides those lips that glow'd with tender fire  And sung her praises to no common lyre  But Friendship wrapt in sorrow's deepest gloom  Shall keep the longest vigils at thy tomb  Her wounded breast disdainful of relief  There claims a fond praeeminence in grief  Short was thy life but ah its thread how fine  How pure the texture of the finish'd line  What tho' thy opening manhood could not gain  Those late rewards maturer toils attain  Hope's firmest promises 'twas thine to raise  That merit's brightest meed would grace thy lengthen'd days  For thine were Judgment's patient powers to draw  Entangled justice from the nets of law  Thine firm Integrity whose language clear  Ne'er swell'd with arrogance or shook with fear  Reason's mild power unvex'd by mental strife  Sway'd the calm current of thy useful life  Whose even course was in no season lost  Nor rough with storms nor stagnated by frost  In scenes of public toil or social ease  'Twas thine by firm sincerity to please  Sweet as the breath of spring thy converse flow'd  As summer's noontide warmth thy friendship glow'd  O'er thy mild manners by no art constrain'd  A pensive pleasing melancholy reign'd  Which won regard and charm'd th' attentive eye  Like the soft lustre of an evening sky  Yet if perchance excited to defend  The injur'd merit of an absent friend  That gentle spirit rous'd to virtuous ire  Indignant flash'd resentment's noble fire  Tho' just observance in thy life may trace  A lovely model of each moral grace  Thy last of days the noblest lesson taught  Severe instruction and too dearly bought  Whose force from memory never can depart  But while it mends must agonize the heart  Tho' thy shrunk nerves were destin'd to sustain  Th' increasing horrors of slowwasting pain  Those spiritquenching pangs whose base controul  Cloud the clear temper and exhaust the soul  Yet in that hour when Death asserts his claim  And his strong summons shakes the conscious frame  When weaker minds by frantic fear o'erthrown  Shrink in wild horror from the dread Unknown  Thy firmer soul with Christian strength renew'd  Nor lost in languor nor by pain subdued  While thy cold grasp the hand of Friendship prest  And her vain aid in fault'ring accents blest  With awe but not as Superstition's slave  Survey'd the gathering shadows of the grave  And to thy God in death devoutly paid  That calm obedience which thy life display'd  Thou friend yet left me of the choicer few  Whom grief's fond eyes with growing love review  O thou whom mutual sorrow will incline  To mix thy sympathetic sighs with mine  Still be it ours to pay with just regret  At Friendship's sacred shrine our common debt  Tho' doom'd so Heaven ordains to see no more  The gentle Being whom we both deplore  Painting shall still sweet soothing art supply  A form so precious in affection's eye  Ah little thought we in that happier hour  When our gay Muse rehears'd the Pencil's power  To mourn that form in cold obstruction laid  And see him only by the pencil's aid  Blest be that pencil every art be blest  That stamps his image deeper on our breast  Oft let us loiter on his favourite hill  Whose shades the sadlypleasing thought instill  Recount his kindness as we fondly rove  And meet his spirit in the lonely grove  At evening's pensive hour or opening day  He yet shall seem the partner of our way  Blest Spirit still thro' fancy's ear impart  The calm of virtue to the troubled heart  Correct each sordid view each vain desire  And touch the mortal with celestial fire  So may we still in this dark scene of earth  Hold sweet communion with thy living worth  And while our purer thoughts thy merit scan  Revere the Angel as we lov'd the Man  FINIS
