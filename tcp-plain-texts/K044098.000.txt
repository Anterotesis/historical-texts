 REMARKS UPON THE EIGHTH SECTION OF THE SECOND VOLUME OF MR WARTON's  History of English Poetry  The Author is certainly at liberty to fancy cases and make whatever comparisons he thinks proper his suppositions still continue as distant from fact as his wild discourses are from solid argument  JUNIUS  LONDON PRINTED FOR T PAYNE AND SON AT THE MEWSGATE  Price One Shilling  REMARKS  c  IN the Annual Register for Mr Dodsley has resumed the subject of Rowlie's Poems The whole of this second publication is taken as he tells us from Mr Warton's History of English Poetry whose opinion from his knowledge as an antiquarian and judgment as a man of taste he looks upon as decisive These extracts made me desirous of reading the whole section from which they were taken I accordingly read it very care∣fully and I am sorry to say that the in∣formation I gained from it was by no means answerable to what I had a right to expect from the reputed abilities and character of that author  The method the Professor there lays down to himself is to give us  Ist Some  account of the manner in which Rowlie's Poems were brought to light  dly Some  specimens of them  He then adds his own opinion viz That Rowlie was not the author that Chatterton was  That Rowlie was not the author he en∣deavours to prove st By external argu∣ments dly By internal Some levelled against the collection of Poems in ge∣neral others against particular pieces  The external arguments are as follow That  the form of the letters essentially dif∣fers from every one of our ancient manuscripts  that  the characters were not uniform  that  care had been evidently taken to tincture the ink with a yellow cast  that  the parchments themselves had been stained with ocre which was easily rubbed off  The manuscript too  which he had examined carefully him∣self bad  it seems  some heraldic delineations  not suitable to the time which confirm him still more in his opinion  The internal arguments are these  An affectation of obsolete words and spellings  improper combinations of them and improper contexture with the present modes of speech  The inconsistency of the style in different pieces the consistency spirit and excel∣lence of the collection in general  The particular pieces whose authen∣ticity he questions are the Song to Aella c J Lydgate's Answer Sir C Bald∣win the Battle of Hastings the Ac∣counte of W Canynge's Feast the Epis∣tle prefixed to the Tragedy and through that the Tragedy itself  Having now proved them to his own satisfaction at least not to be Rowlie's he at once determines them to be Chat∣terton's whom he conceives to have been very capable of such an imposture from his natural abilities and turn of disposi∣tion from his  situation and connections  and from the little difficulty which such a forgery as this would be attended with  These I believe are the chief grounds upon which our author argues and as far as can be collected from a treatise which is not always so regular as it might have been the amount of every thing he says  Having thus given the reader this short view of the Professor's arguments I shall now proceed to examine them particu∣larly As to the method observed by me I shall say nothing that being entirely the Professor's own  First therefore of the narration or  ac∣count he gives of the manner in which the Poems were brought to light  How far this is distinct and clear and agreeable to the general laws of narrative it is not my pre∣sent business to inquire The accuracy of it in regard to truth and fact is all that comes under my notice in which it certainly fails at least if credit is to be given to persons who have examined the matter on the spot with whose accounts the Professor does not always seem to agree Sometimes the difference be∣tween them is trifling such as calling the wooden chest an  iron  one c and indeed would hardly be worth mention∣ing were they not proofs that the Pro∣fessor had never been at Bristol though I believe he was once within sixteen miles of it The age of Chatterton is a very  material circumstance he is said by the Professor to have been  about seventeen  when the Poems were discovered but as he was born at the latter end of and the Poems were discovered at latest in the autumn of he could not then have been quitesixteen The difference of this year will be of more importance than appears at first sight when we consider that he was not known as an author till after fifteen the time at which he left school where his necessary employment was such that he could hardly have much leisure for other stu∣dies  As to the Professor's  specimens of these Poems  whatever his judgment in select∣ing them may have been accuracy in transcribing them seems to be what he has very little attended to For instance the description of the morning which is ascribed by him to the minstrels is a part of Celmonde's speech after the victory at Watchet In the  Chorus or interlude of the damsel who drowns herself  scarce one line agrees with the printed copy The Song to Aella he transcribes at length  John Lydgate's Answer he determines to be  beneath transcription  but that it may not pass wholly unnoticed he gives us a long note to prove it a forgery This ar∣gument has certainly the appearance of being misplaced but it is to be presum∣ed that the Professor had his reasons for it This parchment which contained the Song to Aella J Lydgate's Answer and the introductory letter was one of the very few that Chatterton ever pro∣duced as originals The reasons for which its authenticity is doubted by the Professor are these That  Turgotus and Chaucer are both said to have lived in Norman times  which as he rightly ob∣serves might be true of Turgotus who died in but could not be equally applied to Chaucer who was nearly co∣temporary with Lydgate Perhaps in those times the particle  "and"  might not connect so strongly as it does at present and Turgot may be joined with Chau∣cer only as referring to his excellence and not to the time in which he lived But supposing this remark to be just it will as well prove that Chatterton did not  write it as that Lydgate did not his antiquarian knowledge according to the Professor being such as must have in∣formed him better Besides Chaucer was his favourite author whose glossary he continually consulted It is therefore very near as improbable that such an ana∣chronism should come from him as from Lydgate himself The Professor's next remark is that Chaucer and Turgot  are oddly coupled in another respect  as the latter  only wrote some Latin Chronicles  Now Turgot wrote not in Latin but in his mothertongue according to Bale nor were his works by the same author's account entirely historical It is urged likewise by the Professor as another ob∣jection  that Stowe is mentioned as living with Chaucer and Turgot This Stowe  he says to shew his learning where rea∣sons only are wanted  should be Stone who was Lydgate's cotemporary That this Stowe should be Stone  is very probable as the letters  n  and  w  were so alike in this very parchment that Chatterton read the author's name Ronlie till he was set  right by Mr Barret As to the other assertion of the Professor's that Stowe  is mentioned as living with Chaucer and Tur∣got  the words upon which he founds it are  In Norman times Turgotus and  Great Chaucer did excell  Then Stowe the Bristol Carmelyte  c  Whether this does not mean directly the contrary to what the Professor says it does I shall leave to the reader to deter∣mine The Professor's last argument against this piece is  the extreme and af∣fected meanness of the composition  The word  affected  is most probably here foisted in to avoid the absurdity of supposing this Poem and the Song to Aella the serious productions of the same person Whe∣ther the meanness of any composition can be admitted of as a conclusive proof that it is forged may justly be doubted but the Professor would have done well to have considered the consequences fully before he risqued so dangerous a doc∣trine But to return to the extracts  where among others he cites a passage from  a dialogue between two ladies  viz a soliloquy of one gentleman This cir∣cumstance is of little or no weight on either side and I have only mentioned it to exemplify what he himself con∣fesses that his quotations are not always so accurate as they might have been  Having thus prepared his readers for his opinion he accordingly gives it and very decisively viz  That none of these pieces are genuine  This he rests upon the following circumstances which are I presume his external arguments Among these the first is that Sir Charles Bawdin  is allowed to be modern even by those who maintain all the others to be an∣cient  In all the enquiries I have been able to make I never yet found any body who allowed this Who they were who did allow it and of what authority I could wish the Professor had told us at present his proof cannot be of any great weight with those who are not already predetermined to grant that the Poem is modern His note upon the passage cer∣tainly  does not carry much conviction What is there contained although doubt∣less very curious being in general but little to the purpose what there is to the purpose rather in favour of the Poem than the contrary  The Professor's next objections are drawn from the parchment which con∣tained the Song to Aella and J Lyd∣gate's Answer viz That  the writing was a gross and palpable forgery not even skil∣fully counterfeited  that  the letters though artfully contrived to wear an antiquated appearance differed from all our ancient al∣phabets  that  they were not uniform  that  the parchment had been stained with ocre which was easily rubbed off  and that  care had been evidently taken to tincture the ink with a yellow cast  Part of this would if clearly proved have great weight with many However this does not rest it seems upon the Professor's authority but upon his friend's Perhaps it is not quite fair in him to bring such very positive assertions about manuscripts which can∣not now be referred to as they are to  use his own expression  unfortunately lost  The manner of their loss was too as I have heard extraordinary This the Professor says nothing of whether his friend had been tender of giving him any information on so delicate a subject or whether he thought it might injure his cause and has therefore slurred it over it matters not we must lament and not enquire As to their being  stained with ocre  I have heard from the best autho∣rity that one of the manuscripts was not stained with ocre at least when it left Bristol the yellow roll as the name im∣plies was originally stained for distinction sake nor if there had been any such stain upon the first would it have proved it modern As  from some notices I have received  to use the Professor's own clas∣sical expression  I find  that most of the parchments in many archives throughout the kingdom have a sort of yellow dust upon them which the converting fancy of an  ingenious critic  might especially if inclined before to do so easily misinter∣pret into ocre As to the ink I do not  mean to undervalue the abilities of the Professor's friend it must however re∣quire a greater degree of sagacity than I can well conceive to determine exactly whether the  yellow cast  of the ink was the effect of time or accident or art But after all to what purpose all this it is surely unnecessary for if the Professor's word may be taken he  has already proved Lydgate's answer which was on the same parchment and apparently in the same hand a manifest imposition  What I have above hinted in regard to this same note will I hope make the reader a little scrupu∣lous how he receives any thing from the Professor as an unquestionable truth till he shall have examined it himself pretty carefully at least put him so far upon his guard as not to take any thing at the Professor's hands intirely upon trust  But the Professor not willing to leave the glory of so great a discovery entirely to his friend and to put things out of all doubt acquaints us that his own exami∣nation of the parchment containing the account of W Canynge's Feast confirms  very fully all that he has told us of the two other parchments on the authority of his friend This parchment he says with an appearance of sorrow  betrayed all the suspicious circumstances observed in the Ode to Aella  One would imagine that here at least he must have been uncom∣monly accurate having by all accounts had the manuscript in his possession long enough of all conscience to have made himself thoroughly master of it But I never heard any one except himself say that  it was stained with ocre or that care had been evidently taken to tincture the ink with a yellow cast  As to the difference of the handwriting from that of the age that even supposing it to be true will not I apprehend be looked upon by every one as a decisive proof till the ne∣cessity that all cotemporary writers should write the same hand is made to appear  Even the style and drawing of the armorial bearings  are said by the Professor  to dis∣cover the hand of a modern herald  As to these from all I have been able to learn they are not reducible to any sort of he∣raldry  that ever was But that I may not seem to take a malicious pleasure in disputing every thing he asserts and ac∣cepting and availing myself of those con∣cessions which he so generously makes without making him any in return I will if he pleases give him up this piece Perhaps it may be a forgery there are more reasons for thinking so of this than of any other but the Professor seems not to have hit upon them The remark with which he concludes these external arguments is rather unfortunate He  believes  it seems that this Accounte of W Canynge's Feast  is the only pretended original of Rowlie's poetry now remaining  To talk in so very heedless a manner is hardly using his readers fairly The least attention to the point in hand even once reading over the Poem might have shewn him that Canynge and not Row∣lie was the reputed author of it  Having thus finished his external evi∣dence he proceeds secondly to the in∣ternal His first proof here is  the unna∣tural affectation of ancient spelling and ob∣solete  words not belonging to the period as∣signed these Poems which  according to him  must strike us at first sight  What he means by  not belonging to the period as∣signed these Poems  does not I own im∣mediately strike me Does he mean that they belong to any period before Rowlie's time or any subsequent one or does he intend to hint by these words what Mr Tyrwhitt has told us that many of them are not to be found anywhere Whichever is his meaning he has ex∣prest it rather obscurely but at all events he might certainly have avoided this with little trouble to himself and much satisfaction to his readers by citing some instances His next mark of forgery is that  combinations of these old words are formed which never yet existed in the unpo∣lished state of the English language  That  the antiquated diction is often inartificially misapplied by an improper contexture of the present modes of speech  Here again as I have observed just now it were to be wished that the Professor had given us some instances It would have saved me  and possibly some others much trouble For my own part I have searched and with some diligence for these  contextures and combinations  but hitherto with little success But what is of more impor∣tance  the poet sometimes forgets his assumed character and does not always act his part with consistency for the Interlude of the damsel who drowns herself is much more intelligible and free from uncouth expressions than the general phraseology of these compo∣sitions  This may be easily accounted for by the genius of elegiac poetry which is naturally simple and unaffected There is however another way of accounting for this difference more decisive though less obvious which is that the Professor seems to have modernized it in no less than fortyeight places which one would imagine was not so very easy a task as the whole Poem consists only of nine stanzas Many of his other quotations are inaccurate as he himself rightly ob∣serves but none so much as this In other parts his alterations seem to give the words a more antiquated cast In the  Poem before us this would have defeated the end he had in view the modern ap∣pearance of the Poem being what he founds his objection upon  Having now gone through as I ima∣gined at least for I found myself mistak∣en as the reader will see very shortly his general proofs he comes to particular pieces v g  In the battle of Hastings Stonehenge is called a Druidical temple But about Turgot's time  according to the Professor  no other report prevailed about this miraculous monument than that it was erected in memory of Hengist's massacre This  he says  was the established and uni∣form opinion of the Welch and Armorican bards who had it from the Saxon minstrels That the Druids constructed this stupendous pile for a place of worship was a discovery reserved for the sagacity of a wiser age and the laborious discussion of modern antiqua∣ries  Let us examine a little upon what foundation this great traditional authority is built We have it from the Professor whom we certainly have not too much reason to give implicit credit towho  had it from Geoffry of Monmouth whose romance is nothing more than a collec∣tion of mere fableswho had it from the Armorican bards none of whose works are now extant if ever there were any who had it from the Saxon minstrels who I believe were never extant at all So that this tradition has its original no∣whereis transmitted by people whose testimony does not existconfirmed by one of the most notorious liars that ever lived and the last stamp put to its au∣thenticity by the Professor What in∣fidels must we be who do not submit to such irrefragable evidence But supposing this was the common report which by no means appears is it impossible that a man of learning should have known the truth though contrary to common re∣port He must at least have had better materials so much nearer the times than our  modern antiquaries  who are supposed to be the first authors of this discovery and perhaps as much  sagacity  to have made use of them His next proof is from the Epistle to Lydgate meaning I  suppose the Epistle to Canynge in which he says  some great story of human manners  is recommended as the subject  most suitable for theatrical representation This idea  he says  is the result of that taste and discrimination which could only belong to a more advanced period of society  Sup∣posing this quotation was in Rowlie's words which it is not what direct proof against the tragedy's being ancient can be built upon it Is it improbable that a man of taste should be disgusted at the absurdity of the dramatical representa∣tions which usually prevailed in the age when this was supposed to be written That his genius taste or learning should point out to him the proper object of dramatic poetryThe efforts of genius have not always kept exact pace with the state of society as at some times they have followed it but slowly so at others they have advanced beyond it This argument is seconded by a long note which however contains nothing more than some cavils upon two or three words viz that by  minster  must be meant  the  present cathedral at Bristol  that  Bristol is called a city  which it was not till years after Rowlie and that  Accounte in his time had not lost its original sense and spelling  But in fact St Ewin's church at Bristol was anciently called the minster and not the present cathedral However let us grant that it was the pre∣sent cathedral The present cathedral was at that time an Augustine mona∣stery according to the Professor  In this very note  and minster is by the same authority  In the additions and emendations upon this note  said  in its simple acceptation to signify monastery  So that if it was called minster it was called by its right name The second word is in the prose writings where much is very probably interpolated and about which I never could get any in∣formation I could depend upon The Account of W Canynge's Feast as I have before hinted and shall shew by and by is much to be suspected to be suspected in many particulars and most in the title  But to follow the Professor back to his general arguments and to use his own very expressive words  Above all the cast of the thought the complexion of the sentiment and the structure of the composition evidently prove these pieces not ancient The Ode to AElla  he says  has exactly the air of modern poetry such as is written at this day only disguised with antique spelling and phrase∣ology  But if this be really the Professor's opinion he must have been peculiarly fortunate as very few things which have been published lately or perhaps at any time can stand in competition with them But supposing the Poems are superior to modern ones even that can hardly prove them forgeries Many writers of un∣doubted authority differ much in style from their cotemporaries Terence and Plautus who wrote in the same way as well as in the same age are as different in point of style as any two writers who lived in different ages could have been A similar instance occurs among our own authors Bishop Hall's Virgidemiae were I believe published before Dr  Donne's Satires The difference between them when considered as cotemporary writers is astonishing as great certainly as between Rowlie and Lydgate or any other that lived either at or near those times No positive conclusion can there∣fore be drawn from this kind of objec∣tions  These I believe are all the internal ar∣guments which the Professor has vouch∣safed to give us and of these few seem to make good the point they are designed for much fewer to be of the least im∣portance Objections of weight seem to have been left purposely unsupported either by argument or instance How∣ever  high  the Professor's  authority  may be to have his bare assertions taken for proof is a  greater deference  than he can reason∣ably expect  Having thus proved to his own satis∣faction that Rowlie is not the author of these Poems he at once ascribes them to Chatterton whom he represents as  a pro∣digy of genius  of such talents for poetry that  he would have proved the first of Eng∣lish  poets had he reached a maturer age  Whoever will read the Poems published in his name may perhaps doubt this very extraordinary account of his abili∣ties There cannot in my opinion be any two collections of Poems more essen∣tially different than Chatterton's and Rowlie's The former have every im∣perfection one might expect from the author's age and excel in those points only which are more within the reach of a boy His verses generally flow off in exact cadence and harmony sometimes the thoughts are better exprest than any one reasonably could have expected But if any one looks for the propriety con∣sistency conduct and spirit of Rowlie he will be much disappointed Where does Chatterton observe any one of the rules of good writing Where does Rowlie fail in one In short whatever has been said by the Professor upon the inequality and impropriety of the  old English bards  may be applied with much more justice to Chatterton What  his early compositions written without any de∣sign  to deceive  were which  the first critic of the present age  speaks so highly of I do not know any more than who  this first critic  is Nor is it in my opinion quite fair of the Professor to give so very ex∣traordinary a character of these Poems without specifying which of them they are or giving us some  specimens of them  any more than to overbear us with such irresis∣tible authority without letting us know who this firstrate critic is this image which he has set up for us all to bow down to If however those Poems the Professor means are in the abovemen∣tioned collection I cannot pay so much  deference  to this anonymous critic or even to the Professor himself as to  pro∣nounce  them so very  wonderful  There are certainly marks of genius in them far beyond his education but I cannot say that I have yet met with any thing which promises to make him  the first of English poets  That  by his situation and connections he was a skilful practitioner in various kinds of handwriting  will be found perhaps on inquiry a mere sup∣position  of the Professor's By better au∣thority than the Professor's viz the au∣thority of those who taught him his common hand was a bad one and he wrote very slow or in the Professor's words had but little  facility in the gra∣phic art  The attorney to whom he was articled never employed him except in writing precedents From these circum∣stances it cannot but be evident that the Professor had not sufficient grounds for this assertion In regard  to a sufficient quantity of obsolete words and phrases  those according to the Professor  were readily attainable from the Glossary to Chaucer and Percy's Ballads  As for Percy per∣haps it is barely worth remarking that very few of the words used by Rowlie I question if ten are to be met with in that glossary As to Chaucer the edi∣tion Chatterton had was if I remember the very first that had a glossary to it which is shorter almost by half than any other and does not contain a fifth part so much as the glossary to the last edi∣tion Now surely this must have been  a very poor help for any one much less a sufficient means to have enabled one of his age his education and in many other respects circumstanced as he was to write such poems and to such a num∣ber as these called Rowlie's  The Professor pleased with the success of this last argument makes us with all the security of a conqueror a kind of in∣sulting concession and allows that  some poems written by Rowlie might have been preserved in Canynge's chest  but says that  if there were any they were so enlarged and improved by Chatterton as to become en∣tirely new compositions  What alterations can have so surprising an effect as to make a transcript an original is I own above my comprehension That Chatterton did corrupt many words and modernize others is very certain and the gross mistakes in many of his explications have since been discovered Which mistakes are such as he could never possibly have committed had he been the author and followed his glossary The Professor being tired of concession returns again to  his old way of taking it for granted that he has proved things before he has made any advances towards it The account of W Canynge's Feast  bids  he tells us  the fairest for an original this he has al∣ready proved a forgery  In answer to this I hope I may without the imputation of acting too much like the Professor beg leave to suspend my assent in regard to both these assertions This poem would be safe enough if the Professor's objec∣tions were all that could be brought against its authenticity but there are other circumstances which may give us room to suspect its not being genuine It is very short there is little poetical merit in it very little beyond Chatter∣ton's abilities and Mr Walpole had suggested to him the idea of forgery and shewn him that he might pass for the au∣thor by doubting the authenticity of the other manuscripts But what with me is above all it has not been  unfortunately lost  as two which were thought by some of the best judges unquestionable origi∣nals have been But  that this circum∣stance  is alone sufficient to make us suspect that no originals ever existed  is more than can be granted The proofs that even this manuscript is a forgery are by no means incontestable nor if they were would it follow of course that all or any of the other manuscripts must necessarily be so too  As to the motives which the Professor assigns for such an imposture these are as extraordinary as his proof of it viz first  Lucrative views  This I should appre∣hend could hardly have been the case as if I remember right he communicated the two first manuscripts without receiv∣ing any thing for them and the sums which he received for the others were by all accounts so small that he probably got more by the meanest of those he sent to the magazines As to  the pleasure of deceiving the world  which is the next motive our Professor assigns that is what I have no idea of I do not mean from thence to argue that it is by any means impossible upon farther consideration it seems not wholly improbable and per∣haps  may be thought to have had its in∣fluence with writers of greater repute than Chatterton That he should have  preferred the private success of his imposture to the vanity of appearing as an applauded original author  is utterly inconsistent with his general character It being well known that he never published any thing which he did not send an account of to all his friends and he never owned to any of them that what he had produced under the name of Rowlie was an im∣posture  The Professor's thoughts seem so in∣tirely possessed with his hero Chatterton that I own I am somewhat surprised to find him returning so suddenly to Rowlie and observing that  in the notices which some of the chief patrons of Rowlie's Poetry sent him from Bristol it was affirmed  that the order for the visitation of the chest  This was the chest from which Chatterton constantly said he had taken the poems It was de∣posited by Canynge's order in a muniment room in Redcliffe church and was to be solemnly visited every year  we have before had occasion to speak of was in  Canynge's will  where as he rightly observes there is no such order to be found I am afraid there must have been some mistake about these no∣tices Every body who has been at Bristol must know and the Professor if he had given himself the trouble to have gone thither might have known that it was a deed which contained this order and that he might as well have looked into his friend Geoffrey of Monmouth or Slawkenbergius upon Noses for it as into Canynge's will Upon this with much shew of accuracy and learning he transcribes a great part of the contents of this same will into a note for what reason but to prove that he had read it I cannot conceive And here because Canynge was dean of Westbury college he gives us a short history of the repairs of that college he might as well because Canynge was a merchant have taken oc∣casion to digress into a short dissertation upon trade For in fact all this learn∣ing and all this long quotation would  have been just as much to the purpose and proved as much in one case as it does in the other Had our Professor be∣stowed but half as much care and accu∣racy upon the main points in dispute he might perhaps have gone some way to∣wards settling this whole affair  As to the memoirs of Rowlie I have little to say much possibly may be true and much interpolated for which rea∣son and because as I have said before I never could get any account of this frag∣ment at all satisfactory v g by whom it was first published through whose hands it first passed what authority it ultimately rests upon I shall not attempt to give any opinion at all upon the matter However the Professor's  The words which he objects to are  drawings  in its present uncombined sense  Manuscripts Abbot of Coventrie  instead of  Prior Repayring lease  objections being entirely against words do not seem to affect its authenticity in any article at all material  I have now gone through the Pro∣fessor's section and I must say it has  been a very disagreeable task to which the want of method did not a little con∣tribute and what is worse it seems to be of very little concern with him whe∣ther he is right or wrong whether he informs or misleads his reader Cer∣tainly however he does not fulfill the promise he made at the beginning of his section viz  of laying before his reader every internal and external argument to enable him to determine upon the merits of this controversy  Indeed he tacitly confesses as much himself by annexing to it as he has done some  additions and emendations  From these I had I own some hopes of being more fully satisfied thinking that by this means he had a fair opportunity of retracting some of those rash assertions which he deals in so very largely and correcting at least some of the inac∣curacies we so frequently meet with throughout the section But I am sorry to say that I was miserably disappointed the only  addition  I could perceive being that he has added false fact to false argu∣ment the only  emendation  that he has  corrected himself when he happened by some mistake or other rather unusual with him to be in the right  The same method I prescribed to my∣self in examining the foregoing part of the Professor's work I shall follow in this also and give the reader a summary account of its contents before I examine it particularly These as far as the na∣ture of the thing will admit of its being reduced to any settled form seem to the best of my apprehension to be as follow Some additional cavils upon words some apology for inaccuracies and some  new proofs  for so he chuses to call them against the authenticity of the Poems in general and one of them in particular the Battle of Hastings His arguments against the Poems in general are from their being so excellent in themselves and so very unlike those of cotemporary writers against the Battle of Hastings in particular from the time at which Tur∣got the supposed original author died and from the want of some distinguishing circumstances in the Poem itself After  this the Professor enlarges afresh upon the peculiar merit of Chatterton and the motives which might have tempted him to such a forgery  I am sorry to be forced to observe that the Professor seems to set off rather ominously by correcting himself in one of the few truths and best grounded as∣sertions to be met with in his whole sec∣tion viz that  Turgot died in  fortynine years after the battle of Hastings not in fiftyone years before it as he now affirms in this correction with an intention to build an argument upon it  This correction being no more than one line may escape many readers it is printed with a re∣ference to the page but none to the subject thus  Pag Not Col l for "" read ""  In the following note he informs us that  he has received notices from St Ewin's church at Bristol anciently called the minster which import that the pave∣ment was washed against the coming of King Edward which does not at all prove or imply that the King sat at the great min∣ster  window to see the gallant Lancastrian pass to the scaffold  That I may not seem to differ from him for cavilling sake I here intirely agree with him I believe the washing of the pavement was never urged as a proof that the King sat at the window but only as a corroborating cir∣cumstance of Edward's being at Bristol about that time The circumstance of his sitting at the window the Professor objects to as improbable why I do not see as the general character of Edward rather encourages such a supposition than contradicts it His next objection is that St Ewin's church was formerly called the minster but that he  suspects  that what the poet intended here by the word minster must have been the pre∣sent cathedral and that he  does not think  that  the  minster of our Lady  was a common appellation for Worcester cathedral at that time  Till the Professor thinks fit to pro∣duce some ground for his suspicion and be∣lief they cannot be considered as arguments of any great weight and if he really had made out both I do not see what advan∣tage  it would have been to him in regard to the point in hand  In his next note he confesses very frankly that he may have been guilty of some inaccuracies in his section and makes the reader an apology for them Here again I think the Professor perfectly in the right and as he has confessed thus much in general I do not think it would be amiss if he was to specify and retract all his errors as well in the  additions  and  emendations  as in the section itself It would not be much longer than his sec∣tion which does not seem to have cost him overmuch trouble But to return to his apology He had not it seems when he wrote this eighth section  seen all the Poems  what he had seen were only  extracts  and those extracts  not al∣ways exact  From these concessions of his own have we not some right to ask the Professor the following questions Why he chose to decide upon a subject which he had not thoroughly informed himself of Why he took upon him to promise his readers every  internal and ex∣ternal  argument  relating to the contro∣versy at a time when by his own con∣fession he had not read half the Poems Why in all the time between the writ∣ing of his section and the publication of his book he never took the trouble to go to Bristol and examine the matter on the spot Why since he has read the Poems he has not corrected those errors which he owns he has committed These interrogations are surely natural and the Professor probably might find some difficulty in answering them For however great any man's critical abilities and antiquarian knowledge may be some little acquaintance with the subject he treats of must at least make his decision more satisfactory However even now since he has seen all the Poems his opi∣nion we find is still the same they have even afforded him some  new proofs  The first of which seems to be nothing more than that Rowlie is not like any of our ancient  bards  He has told us be∣fore that the Poems are like modern ones which is pretty much the same  thing But neither the excellence of any composition any more than the  meanness  of it nor indeed the dissimilitude be∣tween that and other cotemporary writ∣ings are by any means an absolute proof that it must be a forgery His next ar∣gument is that the Poems in question  appear to have been composed after ideas of discrimination took place  What sort of Poems they must be which were com∣posed before such a period for my part I own I am somewhat at a loss to con∣ceive as such ideas seem always to be of some little use if not absolutely and in∣dispensably necessary in making any poems whether ancient or modern in∣telligible  But  in the Battle of Hastings there are some great anachronisms and practices men∣tioned which did not subsist till afterwards  The Professor has not however pointed out any particular ones and if there were any they have escaped my observation and I am apt to believe will do the same to most readers His next proof and which perhaps if true would be quite  decisive is as follows  Turgot from whose Saxon  chronicle no longer a Latin one  this Poem is said to be translated died in  and therefore could not have written any account of the Battle of Hastings which did not happen till viz fiftyone years after his death This I own appeared at first sight to have great weight as I did not conceive it possible that any one could be so very ignorant of the author whom he had ac∣tually translated or that one of the Pro∣fessor's character should have misrepre∣sented in so very extraordinary a manner so material a date as this especially as he had founded one of his principal ar∣guments upon it Upon looking into Bale Nicholson and some others it ap∣pears that this latter viz that the Pro∣fessor has misrepresented the case is the fact and that Turgot did not die till as the Professor had rightly ob∣served at first in his note upon J Lyd∣gate's Answer c but finding it would stand in the way of this argument cor∣rected it afterwards in his  additions and  emendations  and has here produced his own error or whatever else the reader shall think proper to call it as a proof that the Poem is a forgery If this be one of those anachronisms the Professor has hinted at before and they are all no better founded than this he has certainly shewn great judgment in keeping them to himself But  allowing that Turgot might have lived in the time of the Con∣queror yet it is very extraordinary that a cotemporary writer should mention nothing but what we knew before and that the in∣cidents are such as are common in all battles  What peculiarities would have satisfied the Professor is not easy to conceive There are surely distinguishing circum∣stances enough in this Poem to give it every mark of being genuine that could reafonably have been expected by any one It agrees with other histories in such a manner as to prove its authenticity that way and where it disagrees it is in such a manner as rather to prove it an ori∣ginal that way Some incidents must be the same in all battles in this however  there feem to be many very distinguish∣ing ones But it is the hard fate of Rowlie to have his Poems found fault with every way If a circumstance not mentioned in other writers occurs such as Stonehenge's being a Druidical temple that is urged against him as a proof of forgery if he agrees with other writ∣ers his Poem is condemned upon that account as if in the first case those who lived some centuries nearer the times of the Druids might not have been better informed than those who lived so many centuries after in the latter as if it was impossible that two writers should agree in the same story  Having thus shewn this piece to be spurious he proceeds from this very  piece to demonstrate the spuriousness of the rest Chatterton allowed the first part to be a forgery of his own the second part from what has been said cannot be genuine and he who could write the second part could write every line in the whole collection  This train of consequences is I own more than I can comprehend the con∣clusion  he means to draw from it is pro∣bably that Chatterton  did write every line in the whole collection  How this is made out the reader may possibly see I do not and can therefore do no more than object to the parts separately And first of Chatterton's declaration how far we can rely upon this is much to be doubted The Professor however as it serves his turn has chosen to give credit to him But sure any one else has at least as much right to believe him when he assirmed the second part to be Row∣lie's as the Professor has when he af∣firmed the first part to be his own Nor is the second part proved a forgery from any thing that has been said by the Pro∣fessor except Chatterton's declaring the first was his own proves the second was so too If this be what the Professor would have us believe his conclusion can hardly be allowed If he would insinu∣ate that his own arguments have proved it a forgery that I think is still less likely to be admitted of  After this the Professor in another  most gracious mood of concessionwhe∣ther from some misgivings of the force of his arguments or from confidence in the strength of them or for any other reason known only to himself I shall not pre∣sume to saywith his usual candour grants that it is possible Chatterton may not be the author but if it was so he says  it is no proof that the Poems are not forged But this is a new and another question  I cannot help observing how∣ever how extremely improbable it is that any man who could write such Poems as these should be against owning them when neither life nor safety nor interest of any kind was in the case but that he should usher his imposture into the world by means of a boy who had just left a charityschool and whose veracity from his known character every one would be inclined to suspect is every thing but impossible It is also equally increadible that a boy of little more than fifteen whose avowed works have not such marks of genius in them as the Professor would make us believewho had never learnt  any thing except reading writing and ac∣countswhose time from the day he left school was mostly taken up in writing for an attorneywhose leisure hours were wasted in debaucherywho died want∣ing upwards of three months of eigh∣teenshould have either time or abilities to contrive and execute such a forgery I hope those few pieces in the Magazines which the Professor has been so kind as to point out and whose peculiar merit might otherwise have escaped the gene∣rality of readers are not instances of that astonishing  prematurity of abilities com∣prehension of mind and vigour of under∣standing which predominated over his situ∣ations in life and opportunities of instruc∣tion  many of them are very bald and in my opinion at most very unsuccess∣ful imitations of Ossian without any great marks of genius or spirit That he wished to put off some of his own poems for Rowlie's is certain I myself have seen some written with such a design but so unlike Rowlie that to unbiassed readers it must appear impossible that  the same person should have written those and the collection printed in Rowlie's name They are the worst even of Chat∣terton's own compositions and shew that however antiquarian imagery had possessed his imagination it communicated no share of excellence to his composition  This to the best of my judgment is the sum of every thing at all material that the Professor has advanced by way of argument In any of which I should be sorry to have omitted or misrepre∣sented the minutest circumstance The latter I have endeavoured to guard against on all occasions as strictly as I possibly could by using as much as possible his own words And if I do not flatter my∣self too much I have I hope made it appear to every unprejudiced reader that his narrative is by no means exact nor his quotations faithful that his ex∣ternal arguments are far from being sa∣tisfactory his internal neither fair nor conclusive that Chatterton was not equal to the composition of such Poems either by his natural or his acquired  abilities in a word that the Professor's system throughout is not supported by a single argument that holds good or a single fact that may not be questioned  FINIS
