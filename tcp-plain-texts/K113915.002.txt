Reinforcement of fresh Troops arrives from HollandEncampment on Mount Magdenberg in Tempatee Creek Remarkable Instance of Lunacy in a NegroMountains Beautiful ViewsThe Sick sent to Europe  I NOW once more return to the principal object of my Journal  viz  Fourgeoud's military operations  CHAP XVI  I have before mentioned that a supply of fresh troops was expected to reinforce our decayed little army and on the th of January the news came to Paramaribo that the transport ship Maastroom Captain Eeg was arrived in the river Surinam and come to an anchor before the fortress Amsterdam with Colonel Seyburgh and two divisions consisting together of one hundred and twenty men under his command two more divisions being expected  The following day I went down with a rowboat to welcome them and having dined on board together the  ship weighed anchor and I sailed up with them till before the fortress Zelandia where they moored and were saluted by a few guns Among the officers I with pleasure recollected my old shipmate poor Ensign Hesseling whom we had left behind us on the Helder according to every appearance dying of the smallpox when we sailed from the Texel the th of December This young man who now joined us with rank of second lieutenant had been peculiarly unfortunate since his recovery for soon after taking a passage on board another ship for Surinam the vessel encountered a gale in the Bay of Biscay when off Cape Finisterre her quartergallery and rudder were beat away besides which she lost her foremast and maintopmast In this dangerous condition having the wind against her for Lisbon the vessel run with difficulty into Plymouth From this place Mr Hesseling took a passage for France on board a small sloop loaded with coals with which he had no better success for she ran through the inadvertence of the master on the Caskets which rocks went through her bottom and she foundered immediately Before the vessel sunk however he had time to break open his chest and take out some linen and other necessaries with which he arrived in a crazy yaul at Brest He now took shipping again for Amsterdam on board a Dutchman but the master ran the ship aground and he had nearly been once more wrecked Nevertheless he arrived safe at the Texel whence he had twice in vain attempted  to set out for South America and on this last passage it blew so violently hard that all the boats the sheep the pigs and the poultry were washed overboard Till this date I had been the oldest officer in the corps excepting only Colonel Fourgeoud  On the arrival of the troops our commander invited them to a dinner which consisted of salt beef pork barley and hard pease of which I had the honour to partake to my no small amusement when I observed the significant looks which were directed by these newcomers on their commander and his entertainment In the evening we conducted them to the playhouse where the death of Caesar and Crispin Doctor were performed the one exactly as laughable as the other I must however confess that I was better entertained the next day when the governor gave to all a superb dinner and supper where the strangers seemed to be as much surprised with the magnificence of the feast as they had been the day before amazed with Colonel Fourgeoud's frugality  Having met at this table with some excellent preserved fruits among which was the  guava  I will embrace an opportunity which is barren of incident to say something of it The guaba or guavatree grows to about twentyfour feet high with leaves like those of a plumtree It is lightcoloured and the wood of little consequence but the fruit which is yellow oval and  about the size of a gold pippin incloses a reddish pulp full of small seeds the pulp is very sweet and may be eaten raw or made into marmalade or jelly and then it is delicious There are two species of guava that which is the sweetest has the smallest quantity of seeds  On the th of February the troops that were so lately landed were sent to the upper parts of the river Comewina to be encamped I speak of the privates for most of the officers remained to partake of a feast at the house of a Mr Mercellus by whose command to crown the banquet half a dozen negroes continued blowing the trumpet and French horn in the room where we dined till the company were absolutely deafened by discordancy and noise  On the th the whole corps without exception received orders to leave Paramaribo and to encamp at Magdenberg a mountain near the Tempatee Creek in the upper parts of the river Comewina to which as I have just mentioned the reinforcement was already dispatched Having therefore prepared myself to set out on my fourth campaign and taken leave of my little family and friends I repaired to the water side to set out in the same barge with Colonel Seyburgh but who erroneously supposing that the troops which came with him from Holland were a distinct corps from those arrived with Fourgeoud in made the negroes shove off the boat in my presence when I was not a stone's cast from it and left  View of L'Esperance or the Hope on the Commewine  View of Clarenbeck on the River Commewine  me on the beach to my utter surprize and mortification I knew Fourgeoud had swore that he should  "dance just as much to his pipes as the youngest ensign in the regiment"  and in that he was perfectly right I therefore strenuously supported the chief against his antagonist and setting off immediately with another boat soon overtook him to his astonishment when we all went ashore at the plantation Vossenburgh in the river Comewina The next day we came to the estate Arentrust having passed the heavy barges that departed from Paramaribo on the th and on the th we made the Hope where having spent so many months I here present the reader with a view of that estate and of the estate Clarenbeek where still our hospital was kept This day Colonel Fourgeoud also came up the river and slept at Wajampibo  On the th we arrived at the plantation Crawassibo where we passed the night Here the overseer a Mr De Bruyn was so very impertinent that as I already had no abundance of affection for the fraternity of overseers I gave him such a sound beating that with a bloody face he suddenly decamped from the estate in a small canoe with one negro and in this trim at twelve o'clock at night like Banquo the ghost appeared before the amazed Fourgeoud who thought proper to give him no other consolation than to dismiss him with a hearty curse  On the th we arrived safe at Magdenberg  viz  Fourgeoud the officers and the barges with the privates From the Hope the estates now began to appear thinner and after passing GoetAccord about ten or twelve miles farther upwards not a cultivated spot was to be seen the plantations having been all laid in ashes by the rebels in as I have already mentioned a small place excepted just below Magdenberg which is I think called the  Jacob  and where a few negroes are kept to cut timber The river above Goetaccord becomes very narrow being lined on each side with impenetrable brushwood like the river Cottica between Devil'sHarwar and Patamaca and the Tempatee Creek which may be considered as the source of the whole river Comewina becomes also much narrower Magdenberg which is about a hundred miles from Paramaribo was formerly an estate but has now not a vestige of cultivation left a poor old orangetree excepted and is at present neither more or less than a barren desolate mountain  Here we found the surface of the earth in some places covered with a kind of strata that had the appearance of motherofpearl and lay scattered in small scales about the size of an English shilling In many places of Surinam are found the marks of fossils and ores as I have already hinted Indeed iron ore is common and I have no doubt but gold and silver mines might be met with if the Dutch would be at the expence and persevere in making the discovery I have already mentioned the Marawina diamond and white and red agate which are  often seen in the upper parts of the river Surinam On this mountain we also found the air cooler and more pure and of course more healthy than in any other part of the colony  On the th the news reached us that the transport ship the Maria Helena with the remaining two divisions of one hundred and twenty men commanded by Captain Hamel had also arrived in the river Surinam on the th instant Thus the reinforcements together consisted of two hundred and forty men and on the th day of March they all arrived in heavy barges at Magdenberg where I may now say that Colonel Fourgeoud's whole forces were assembled The same day one hundred negro slaves also arrived to carry the loads when we should march One of the new negroes being missed from on board a military barge and marks of blood discovered in it the commanding officer a Mr Chatteauview and a sentinel were both put under an arrest to be tried for murder On the same eventful day also two of our captains fought a duel in which one of them received a wound in his forehead  On the th a barge with provisions coming from Paramaribo shocking to relate found the negro that was missed on the th at the water's edge lying in the brushwood with his throat cut from ear to ear but still alive the knife having missed the windpipe This miserable apparition of skin and bone they took on board and  brought to Magdenberg where by a skilful surgeon Mr Knolaert the wound was sewed up and the man surprisingly recovered having lain nine days in that dreadful condition without any subsistence or covering whatever and weltering in his own blood even without a bandage The week after I had nearly lost my own life by an accident Two negroes of the estate GoetAccord being employed in hunting and fishing for Fourgeoud one of them named  Philander  proposed to me to accompany them in the wood where we might chance to meet with some  pingoes  or  powesa  but a heavy shower of rain coming on when we had only walked two miles we determined to relinquish the project and repair to the small spot called the Jacob for shelter to gain which we were obliged to pass through a deep marsh Having waded till up to our armpits Philander who was the finest man without exception that I ever saw began to swim as did his companion with one hand holding their fowling pieces above the water with the other and desired me to follow them This I tried having nothing on but my shirt and trowsers when after swimming two or three strokes I sunk to the bottom like a stone with the weight of my musquet but relinquishing it I immediately rose to the surface and begged that Philander would dive for it who having secured his own to a mangrove brought it up without difficulty At this moment a thundering voice called out through the thicket    "Who  somma datty  and another  sooto sooto da Bonny kiry da dago  Who is that Who is there Fire shoot it is Bonny kill the dog"  and looking up we saw the muzzles of six musquets presented upon us at a very little distance indeed I instantly dived but Philander answering that we belonged to Magdenberg we were permitted to come on shore one by one at the Jacob and found that these trusty negro slaves having heard a flouncing in the water and seeing three armed men in the marsh took it for granted that the rebels were coming headed by Bonny himself for whom they had mistaken me being almost naked and so much sunburnt besides my hair which was short and curly I entirely resembled a mulatto Being refreshed with some rum and having dried ourselves by a good fire we now returned back to the Magdenberg where I congratulated myself on my escape  On the th Colonel Fourgeoud being now supplied with fresh troops sent a whole ship load of invalids to Holland who sailed this day and on February the th my dear friend Heneman also sailed for Holland in an extremely debilitated state  Among the troops which sailed at the same time with Heneman were several officers not very sick but justly disheartened and disgusted at Fourgeoud's injustice in having stopped their preferment as I have intimated in the end of the tenth chapter while they now saw themselves superseded by raw youths who were at school  at the time they were serving the colony in With this vessel sailed also the officers whom he had put under an arrest the th December Never was an hospital ship so ill provided with refreshments  On the st Fourgeoud reviewed with pleasure his recruited little army where I was sorry the rangers did not appear He now dispatched one hundred men as a patrole to reconnoitre the skirts of his new encampment of which number I had the honour to be one During this time nothing remarkable happened except meeting with a large company of  quatas  which being one of the most remarkable species of monkies in the world from their affinity to the human race I cannot tacitly pass over One evening walking with my black boy Quaco without the camp they came down so low to look at us and threw small sticks and excrements at us that we stopped and I had an opportunity thoroughly to examine them The  quata  or  quato  is very large with an enormous tail their arms and legs being covered over with long black hair they make a very hideous appearance indeed the more so as the creature's face is quite naked and red with deep sunk eyes which gives it much the appearance of an old Indian woman It has short ears and only four fingers without a thumb on its hands or fore feet but it has five toes on the hinder feet all of which have black nails The extremity of its tail has a spiral turn inwardly it is naked and callous by its frequently  The Quato Saccawinkee Monkeys  hanging to the branches of the trees for when so employed it serves the animal as a fifth limb Most wonderful is the agility of these monkies in swinging from one tree to another but I never saw them leap Their throwing short sticks and excrements seems to be no more than a mimicking of the human actions without any purpose as they neither have strength to throw far nor dexterity to hit their objects and if they befoul them it is by accident only But what appears peculiarly remarkable is that when one is hurt by a musket or arrow the poor animal instantly claps its hand on the wound looks at the blood and with the most piteous lamentations ascends to the very top of the tree in which he is assisted by his companions where hanging by the tail he continues to bewail his fate till by the loss of blood he grows totally faint and drops down dead at the feet of his adversaries  It is not so extraordinary that one of this species when wounded should be assisted by his companions in climbing but that they should have so much knowledge in botany as to procure vulnerary herbs and chew and apply them to the wound is what I cannot credit though it is so confidently asserted by a late traveller and as to the assistance they give in passing a river by holding each other's tails and swinging till the lowermost is thrown up to the branch of a high tree though I have a great opinion of Ullod who relates it and has given a print of  it in a vignette since he does not say he saw it himself I must take the liberty to doubt this fact  It is most probable that Ulloa took the account from Acosta's History of the West Indies This is his account taken from a translation printed in  "They leap where they list winding their tails about a branch to shake it when they will leap farther than they can at once they use a pretty device tying themselves by the tails one of another and by this means make as it were a chain of many then do they launch themselves forth"  Acosta does not say he saw this himself but to the following he professes he was an eyewitness These are his words  "I  saw  one in Carthagene in the governor's house so taught as the things he did seemed incredible They sent him to the tavern for wine putting the pot in one hand and the money in the other they could not possibly get the money out of his hand before he had his pot full of wine If any children met him in the street and threw stones at him he would set his pot down and cast stones against the children till he had assured his way then would he return to carry home his pot And which is more although he were a good bibber of wine yet he would never touch it till leave was given him"  and even what he says he witnessed  I must here mention another monkey that I saw at Colonel Fourgeoud's house which is in Surinam called the  wanacoe  and is covered over with long black hair like the quato but its limbs are shorter and more hairy and its face is a kind of dirty white This monkey is the only one of the species that is not sociable being constantly found alone and so despicable is this solitary animal that he is continually beaten and robbed of his food by all the others from whom he is too lazy to escape though too cowardly to fight  Of the longhaired monkies the  saccawinkee  is the smallest indeed I may say of all the monkies in  Guiana if not in the world being not much larger than a Norway rat  This is a beautiful little animal with blackish grey frizzled hair a white face and very bright shining eyes its ears are large and naked yet they are not very perceptible being covered by the very long and white whiskers that grow round the whole visage of this little creature its feet are not unlike those of a squirrel and its tail is bushy and annulated So very delicate is the saccawinkee and so sensible of the cold that scarcely one of them is brought to Europe alive and if they are they very soon pine and die The Dutch call them the  shagarintee  from their being chagrined at the smallest trifle In the annexed plate I have delineated both those monkies the large quato and the small saccawinkee thus endeavouring to correct with my pencil the deficiency of my pen  On my return to the Magdenberg I narrowly escaped being crushed to death by an enormous tree which dropped by age just at my feet These accidents frequently happen in the forest this however only slightly wounded two or three of our marines During this trip we had much rain and were obliged to cross over a small creek We cut down one of the palmtrees on the water's edge which falling across the river formed a temporary bridge  I now paid a visit to the miserable negro who had been found with his throat cut and who was so well as to  be able to converse when he declared to me that he committed this violent action with his own hand The suspected officer and sentinel were therefore instantly acquitted I asked him by what reason he had been incited to suicide and he answered"None"  "I have" said he "as good a master and mistress as I could wish and a family of my own that I much love I had slept sound during the whole night till about four o'clock in the morning when awaking I took my knife to pick my teeth with it and instantaneously cut my throat without knowing why but the moment after repented of what I had done I then rose from my hammock and got into the canoe to wash myself and try to bind up the wound but stooping over the side and bleeding very fast I turned faint and fell into the river I was now no more able to get on board or to cry for assistance However by struggling I made shift to get on shore where I fell down and lay helpless till I was picked up by a boat going to Magdenberg during all which time of nine days I had my perfect senses and saw a tamanoir or antbear come to smell the putrid blood about my neck who on seeing me move retired into the forest"  I gave the poor man some Boston biscuits which I had got from Paramaribo a large calibash with barley to make him some soup and also some wine This negro appeared to be about sixty years of age  I now to my sorrow received a letter from Mr Kennedy  who was preparing to visit Holland requesting that my boy Quaco might be returned to his estate I accordingly sent him down with a letter offering to buy him of his master as soon as it should be in my power to pay him  On the d of April Colonel Fourgeoud ordered all the sick remaining in the colony to Magdenberg where he had erected an hospital and a large victualling magazine Thus all the invalids from Clarenbeck arrived here with surgeons apothecaries attendants c and here in fact as I said the air was more healthy At this period the old gentleman was particularly illnatured and abused both friend and foe without distinction swearing that not a soul should be exempt from duty provided they could but stand on their legs About this time a strong detachment was sent to the estate Bruyinsburgh in Comewina where an insurrection was expected the slaves refusing to work upon a Sunday to which however they were driven by the lash of the whip  It was now in the midst of the rainy season that Fourgeoud declared his intention of scouring the woods and in consequence gave orders for two strong columns to march the next day The reason for chusing this season was that if he could now dislodge the rebels they must starve for want which would not be the case in the dry months for then the forest abounds with fruits and roots of many kinds This was however in my opinion a false piece of generalship if it be considered on the  other hand the dreadful havock which the wet weather must produce among his troops of which he killed I suppose at the rate of twenty to one rebel negro  Fourgeoud was himself of a very strong constitution having been used to hunting and shooting the whole of his lifetime to which he added temperance and the daily use of his beloved  tisan  His dress consisted of nothing but a waistcoat through one of the buttonholes of which he wore his sword on his head he wore a cotton nightcap with a white beaver hat above it and in his hand a cane but he seldom carried his musket or his pistols I have seen him all in rags and barefooted like the meanest soldier  On the morning of the d of April at six o'clock the two columns set out upon their march the one commanded by Colonel Seyburg the other by Fourgeoud to which last I had the honour to belong Our poor men were now loaded like asses They were ordered to put their firelocks in their knapsacks of course the muzzles excepted this was to keep them from the rain which absolutely poured in torrents Our course was south by east up among the banks of the Tempatee Creek where we soon came to swamps and were marching in the water above our knees  During the first day's march we met some very pretty squirrels which are of several kinds in this country Those that we saw were brown with the belly white the tail not so bushy nor were they upon the whole so large  as those of Europe There are also white squirrels in this country with red eyes and flying squirrels These it is well known have no wings but a membrane between the fore and hinder leg being a part of their skin which when they leap expands like the wing of a bat and by this like a parachute they rest upon the air and in their flights are carried to a considerable distance  On the th of April we marched again our course south by east till two o'clock when we changed our course to southsouthwest  This day we passed by piles of fine timber that were left there to rot since when the estates were demolished by the negro slaves who were in rebellion Among these were the  purplehearttree  the  ironwoodtree  and the  bourracourra  known in England by the name of Brazil  The purplehearttree grows sometimes to the height of fourscore feet and thick in proportion with a smooth dark brown bark the wood is of a beautiful purple colour and an agreeable smell and is much esteemed on account of its weight and durability  The ironwoodtree so called from the gravity and permanent quality of its timber grows to about sixty feet in height with a lightcoloured bark It is much valued by the natives as well as the Europeans on account of its hardness in particular resisting even the hatchet and for taking a most beautiful bright polish This wood sinks in water  The bourracourra or brazil grows to between thirty and forty feet high but not very thick with a reddish bark The heart only of this tree is valuable after the white pithy part is cut away though then it is much diminished This wood is as truly beautiful as it is useful the colour being a fine crimson variegated with irregular and fantastical black spots from which by the French it is called  bois de lettres  It is heavy hard and durable though rather brittle and is capable of taking the brightest polish this last is scarce in Guiana but the others are more plentiful growing on the highest grounds where also is found ebony The heavy trees being shaped into timbers for sugarmills are chiefly sent to the English West India islands and often sold for the price of fifty guineas each piece  The word of command being again given on the th we unslung our hammocks then marched southsoutheast and south by east through deep and dangerous marshes up to our breasts in water and in very heavy rains in which helpless situation we were suddenly alarmed not by a party of rebels but by a company of large monkies which we discovered in the tops of the trees knocking a kind of nuts against the branches to break them for their contents with the greatest regularity as it were keeping time alternately at every stroke while some of them threw down their burthens and a nut falling from a considerable height broke the head of one of our marines The sound of breaking these nuts we had mistaken for the rebel negroes cutting wood with an axe  In the evening we encamped near the Tempatee Creek where we made large fires and built comfortable huts thus this night we slept protected from the wet Here we found the best water I ever tasted and in the camp I saw two remarkable lizards the one called the  devil of the woods  and the other  agama  in this country The first is an ugly small lizard of a deep brown or blackish colour which runs with amazing swiftness up and down the trees it has no scales a large head and it is said to bite which is supposed to be an uncommon property in a lizard The other is called the  Mexican cameleon  which is remarkably splendid and like others of the kind is endued with the property of changing its colour but of its nature and qualities I can say little more having never had the opportunity of a close examination In Surinam there is also a species of lizard known by the name of  salamander  which also I never saw  On the th we marched again keeping due west till twelve o'clock through very heavy rain and deep water when we changed our course to the north and passed over very high mountains by many supposed to be pregnant with treasure  "Rocks rich with gems and mountains bright with mines  "That on the high equator ridgy rise  "Where many a bursting stream auriferous plays  "Majestic woods of every vigorous green  "Stage above stage high waving o'er the hills"  THOMSON  The two highest mountains in South America are that peak of the Andes called  Chimborazo  which measures geometrical feet above the surface of the South Sea having though under the line feet of its summit continually covered with snow The other is that on the slope of which is built the city of Quito at the heighth of feet and is thought to be the highest inhabited land in South America if not in the world  We still continued marching north on the th over mountains from which at intervals we had undoubtedly the most enchanting prospects as well from the wildness of the country as the beautiful variegated verdure displayed in so many different shades through this amazing forest Here I saw a bird which is called a  woodcock  which appears to have much of the colour of those in Europe but which flew very heavily I was however informed that it can run with incredible swiftness But the objects which most attracted my attention were the  arnottatrees  a few of which we met with of these I have copied one of the twigs with great exactness This tree which is also called the  rowcow  or the  orleantree  and by the Indians  cossowee  may rather be stiled a shrub as it does not grow above twelve feet in height The leaves are greener on one side than the other and are divided by fibres of a reddish brown colour as is also the stem the pods which are as large as a small hen's egg are bristled like the outer husk of a chesnut At first they are a beautiful rose colour which as they  Sprig of the Arnotta or Roucon Tree▪  ripen changes to a dark brown when they burst open and display a rich crimson pulp in which are contained seeds that are black like those of a grape The use of this pulp I have already described when speaking of the Aborigines or Indians and now I present the reader with a view of it though from necessity on a small scale  A  is the leaf above  B  the same below  C  the pod before it is yet ripe  D  the same ripe and exposing the crimson pulp  E  the black seed covered over with part of the pulp Here again I must take the liberty to observe that the  rowcow  plant exhibited by the celebrated Madam Merian is very unlike the original that I saw and to my great surprize she says it grows on a large tree  Having crossed an arm of the Mapanee Creek in the evening we once more returned to our camp at Magdenberg Mr Noot one of our officers and several others were so ill that they were carried in their hammocks upon poles by the negro slaves and a great number were so very weak that they could scarcely support the weight of their emaciated bodies but to complain of sickness was to mutiny till they dropped down almost ready to expire During this expedition in which we still perceived nothing of the enemy I was remarkably fortunate having neither suffered by fatigue nor been persecuted by extraordinary bad usage The succeeding day Colonel Seyburg's column arrived having like us seen no appearance of the rebels  On the th my boy Quaco returned from Paramaribo  his master Mr Walter Kennedy having to my great joy sold him to me for the sum of five hundred Dutch florins amounting with the expences to near fifty pounds for which Colonel Fourgeoud very civilly gave me a bill on his agent The payment of this faithful servant's ransom of course revived my impatience for the longwished moment of emancipation of my poor Joanna and her boy from whose new master I had not yet received any answer  While we continued here a negro brought me a beautiful butterfly which I copied with all the correctness I was master of and which I saw since in Madam Merian's collection where it is coloured very ill This fly was a dark blue tinged with green and variegated with spots like a peacock's feather and on each wing it had a spot of pale yellow the under part of the wings were a charming crimson and purple the body a pale redThe caterpillar is green and yellow it is crowned with eight horns on the head and has two on the tail About the same time Captain Fredericy returned also from traversing the woods He had a corporal drowned by slipping off a tree in crossing over a creek which accident frequently happened but the men were generally picked up except this poor fellow who sunk to the bottom instantly with all his accoutrements  Another negro also brought me a regale of  groegroe  or cabbagetree worms as they are called in Surinam  The Blue Crimson Butterfly of South America  The Groogroo or Palm Tree Worms  This reptile is produced in a tree called the  mountaincabbagetree  which is one of the palm species The worm grows to the size and thickness of a man's thumb is produced from the spawn of a black beetle and is extremely fat However disgusting to appearance these worms are a delicious treat to many people and they are regularly sold at Paramaribo The manner of dressing them is by frying them in a pan with a very little butter and salt or spitting them on a wooden skewer In taste they partake of all the spices of India as mace cinnamon cloves nutmegs c Several species of these worms are produced in all the palmtrees when beginning to rot but some are larger than others They are all of a pale yellow colour with black heads In the plate annexed are represented the abovementioned fine butterfly and the cabbagetreeworm both of the natural size taken from the life By the Indians and negroes they are called  toecoema  On the th a detachment departed for La Rochelle in Patamaca and the following day a captain was sent with a few men back to the Hope in Comewina to protect the estates in that river  On the same day the miserable old negro who had cut his throat on the th day of March but had since recovered was seen by some slaves to enter the wood with a knife from which he no more returned being soon after found stabbed to death We were afterwards informed by his master that for some time before  he had attempted to do the same almost regularly from month to month  On the th the detachment returned from La Rochelle where the troops of the Society were all sick  Colonel Fourgeoud now treated me with the greatest politeness And at his earnest request I presented him on the th with various drawings representing himself and his troops struggling with the hardships annexed to the service they were sent on and which drawings he told me were intended to shew the  Prince of Orange  and the  States  a specimen of what he and his marines did undergo in the forests of Guiana  He now gave me leave for fourteen days to go to town to wish Mr Kennedy a prosperous voyage to Europe Availing myself therefore of his good humour I left Magdenberg within one hour and made such dispatch that I came to Paramaribo on the d where I found my friends and little family all well at the house of Mr  de la Mare  to which they were immediately sent from that of Mr Lolkens who had during my last absence entertained them and treated them with the greatest attention and hospitality  CHAP XVII New Instances of unprecedented BarbarityOccurrences on Mount Magdenberg Prices of Provisions at Paramaribo Description of a new AnimalGreat Mortality amongst the Troops in Tempatee and Comewina River  THE first visit I now made was to Mr Kennedy  CHAP XVII  to bid him farewel I then paid five hundred florins for the black boy for which he gave me a receipt and Quaco was mine About this time I fell ill with a fever which however lasted but a few days Walking out on the st of May I observed a croud of people along the waterside before the house of Mr Slkr where appeared the dreadful spectacle of a beautiful young mulatto girl floating on her back with her hands tied behind her throat most shockingly cut and stabbed in the breast with a knife in more than eight or ten different places This was reported to have been the work of that infernal fiend Mrs Slkr from a motive of jealousy suspecting that her husband might fall in love with this poor unfortunate female This monster of a woman had before drowned a negro infant merely for crying as I have said nay she was accused of still greater barbarity were greater barbarity possible Arriving one  day at her estate to view some negroes newly purchased her eye chanced to fall on a fine negro girl about fifteen years of age who could not even speak the language of the country Observing her to be a remarkably fine figure with a sweet engaging countenance her diabolical jealousy instantly prompted her to burn the girl's cheeks mouth and forehead with a redhot iron she also cut the tendon Achilles of one of her legs thus rendering her a monster of deformity and a miserable object as long as she lived the poor victim not knowing what she had done to deserve so severe a punishment  Some of the negroes now representing to this lady the many cruelties she daily inflicted and supplicating her to be of a milder disposition it was reported that she instantly knocked out the brains of a Quaderoon child and caused the heads of two young negroes its relations to be chopped off for having endeavoured to prevent her these heads when she had left the estate were tied in silk handkerchiefs and carried by the surviving relations to Paramaribo where they were laid at the feet of the governor with the following speech  "  This  your Excellency is the head of my son and  this  is the head of my brother struck off by our mistress's command for endeavouring to prevent her murders We know our evidence is nothing in a state of slavery but if these bloody heads be a sufficient proof of what we say we only beg that such pernicious acts may be prevented in time to come in acknowledgment  of which we will all chearfully shed our blood for the preservation and prosperity of our master our mistress and the colony"  To this humble and pathetic remonstrance the answer was that they were all liars and should as such be flogged round the streets of Paramaribo and this most iniquitous sentence was executed with the greatest severity  Such is the consequence of the law of the colony that the testimony of a negro is never to be taken Had any one white person been present at the above carnage the evidence would have been good but even then this fury would have escaped by paying a fine of fifty pounds for each murderBut enoughmy soul sinks within me while I dwell so long upon the subject  On the d of May being again perfectly recovered I took leave of Joanna and her Johnny for thus he was named after myself though the ceremony of baptism could not yet be performed they now continued at my friend De la Mare's house whilst I set out once more for Magdenberg in a tentboat with six oars  On the d I called at Egmond on my French friend Monsieur Cachelieu and next day stopt at Oranjebo or Ornamibo where I was heartily entertained by my old adversary Captain Meyland with whom I had fought at the Wana Creek But now this gentleman declared that he loved me better than any man in the colony He was just returned from a twelve days cruize through the woods  Among his men I recollected one Cordus a gentleman's son from Hamburgh in which character I had known him and who had been trepanned into the West India Company's service by the crimps or silvercoopers as a common soldier This corps as I have already said is composed of all nations Christians Gentiles and even Jews the latter I must observe devoured pork and bacon without scruple or hesitation as often as they could find it  On this spot which had formerly been a plantation but was now choked with weeds I met with some herbs which again I cannot pass unnoticed though I have no other names for them than those given me by the negroes one only excepted which is commonly known by the name of the  siliquahirsuta  cowedge or cowitch and called by the black people  crassyweereeweeree  I can only describe this as a kind of pea or rather flattish small purple bean growing in a pod from a slender creeping vine these pods are covered with a kind of fine elastic spicula which when touched cause an intolerable itching This hairy coat scraped from the pod and taken in a teaspoon with jelly c has been strongly recommended as a vermifuge A sort of wood was also shewn me here by one of the slaves which he called  crassywood  this had the same itching effect when touched but with respect to its general qualities I can say nothing further The other shrubs that we found were what they called  consacaweereeweeree  these grow  with large green leaves which the negroes use for the cure of a disorder in the feet called  consaca  when they can procure no limes or lemons as I have already mentioned this plant also makes an excellent sallad The  deaweereeweeree  is a fine wholesome herb and very much esteemed but the  cuttyweereeweeree  is amongst the most serious pests in the colony being a kind of strong edged grass which is in some places very plentiful and when a man walks through it will cut his legs like a razor Herbs in general are in this country known by the name of  weereeweeree  by the negroes  On the th I arrived at Magdenberg Here Colonel Seyburg and what he called his officers seemed to form a distinct corps from those of Fourgeoud They appeared totally destitute of politeness and treated each other with the greatest rudeness while their colonel was most cordially hated by the commander in chief This state of things contributed to render our situation still more disagreeable I however had at this time little reason to complain being for the present at least in the good graces of Fourgeoud which by a trifling accident I had nearly again forfeited Colonel Fourgeoud having purchased of some Indians a couple of most beautiful parrots called here  cocatoos  which were in a cage ready to be shipped off as a present to her royal highness the princess of Orange I persuaded Monsieur Laurant his valetdechambre to take one of them out that I might the better examine it but the cagedoor was no sooner  opened than it gave a shriek and disappeared in an instant flying over the Tempatee Creek The poor valet stood perfectly petrified and could only pronounce "Voyezvous" whilst I took to my heels to avoid the approaching storm but stopped near enough to observe Fourgeoud's motions through the underwood He was no sooner informed of the  dreadful  accident than he began to storm swear and dance like a man totally deprived of reason he next by kicking it killed a poor waddling duck belonging to one of our officers and at last actually trampled his very wig under his feet while I stood trembling and the rest of the spectators were laughing aloud In about half an hour his passion began gradually to cool and then he had recourse to a stratagem which actually brought the parrot back into his possession He placed the remaining captive on the top of its cage tied by a small cord round its claw this he set in the open air putting a ripe banana inside and leaving the door open so that any other bird except the prisoner might come at it the poor captive at last becoming very hungry made such a noise and shrieking as to be heard by his mate who returning entered the cage in quest of food and was once more deprived of his freedom I now ventured from my concealment and was acquitted after a gentle reproof though poor Laurant as may well be imagined did not escape without a thundering lecture  The cocatoos are less than the parrots and of a green colour except the head and a few feathers in the tail  which are of a pale red This bird is crowned with a  panashe  or bunch of feathers and which generally lie backward but which it erects at pleasure when it is irritated or afraid  I have also seen in Surinam a parrot of a deep slate blue colour though not like those that come from the coast of Guinea which are rather of a leadgrey This parrot is said to be very scarce and only inhabits the deepest recesses of the forest whence it is brought to Paramaribo by the Indians this bird is less than the common parrot but appears very strong and lively The most common parrots in Guiana are those which Marcgrave calls  ajuriicura  These birds are not so large as those that come from Africa they are green with the breast and belly a pale yellow on the top of the head they have a blue spot and the feet are grey with four toes like the rest of the genus two before and two behind in the wings they have some feathers of a bright blue and some a deep crimson they are more a nuisance than a pleasure in Surinam where in prodigious flocks they perch amongst the coffee maize rice c and commit great devastations and what makes them a still greater nuisance their shrieking noise is almost insupportable They always fly in pairs and very swift towards the east as I have observed meeting the sun in the morning and toward the west they follow it in the evening they generally breed in remote places and lay two eggs I brought down two of these parrots at a shot when I was  at Sporksgift estate these animals not being quite dead scratched me most terribly with their sharp claws as they are very strong and tenacious of life We had them dressed and they made no bad soup they may also do in a pye as rooks in England but dressed in any other way they are tough and disagreeable These green parrots may be taught to speak laugh cry bark whistle or mew but not near so well as those which come from Africa It is said they are often intoxicated by the seeds of the cotton plant These parrots are also subject to fits perhaps from their choleric disposition yet longevity is peculiarly ascribed to them by the Indians they have strong hooked bills which assist them in climbing and cracking very hard nuts and they sometimes bite very severely they delight in swinging and balancing hanging from the branches of trees and in their wild as well as domestic state use one of their claws as a hand to take their food  In Surinam there are also some beautiful paroquets which are a species of parrots but smaller though not less common the finest of these is of the size of a very small pigeon they are of a lively green on the back and tail but the head and neck are auburn the feathers on the last being edged with a gold colour which gives them the appearance of rich scollops or scales the breast is of a leaden hue the belly lilac the wings tipped with orange and azure and the bill of a very dark blue the eyes are the colour of fire and the feet quite black The other  The Anamoe Green Parrots of Guiana  species are perfectly green with a white bill and a crimson spot on the head these make an agreeable chattering but are not so easily domesticated as the former  I was presented this evening by a soldier with a bird of a quite different kind which he had actually caught with his hands This was no other than the  annamoe  or Surinam partridge and a finer creature I never saw it was of the size of a large duck extremely fat and of a dark brown colour on the back and wings and on the top of the head the under part of which the breast the belly and the thighs were of a fine creamcolour intermixed with orange feathers and very small transverse black bars The body was exactly the shape of an egg it had no tail the neck was long the bill short but very sharppointed and a little curved the eyes were bright and as black as jet the legs short of the colour of vermilion with three small toes on each foot This bird it is said runs with amazing swiftness hiding itself amongst the grass and weeds but flies very heavily on account of its plumpness which was the cause of its being thus overtaken by the marine We had it roasted and indeed nothing could be more delicious As I took a correct drawing of it I refer the reader to the annexed plate where he may also see the parrot of South America as described above besides a few curious nests of which I have given an account in Vol I p but where I had no opportunity of placing them and which besides their curiosity may serve to shew how much the public are imposed  upon when in Goldsmith's Animated Nature Vol V p that author asserts that they are built on the banana and plantain trees where he also describes the monkies and numbers of large serpents as assembling All this I here think it my duty to pronounce erroneous as I consider it would be unpardonable in me to let such absurdities pass by unnoticed  On the th an accident had nearly befallen me which must have caused me much poignant and lasting sorrow My black boy washing my cotton hammock in the Tempatee Creek was suddenly carried to the bottom by the rapidity of the stream and entangled in its lashings so that both the one and the other disappeared the boy however luckily extricated himself though with great difficulty and to my great joy though more than half drowned appeared once more on terra firma when he had the presence of mind instantly to sink a large fishhook with a lead tied to a strong line some yards below the spot with which he actually brought up the hammock to our astonishment the stream running so swift that it rolled over the ground and was liable to shift its station every moment  The following day as Captain Hamel was angling his tackle got fast at the bottom of the creek when in diving to clear it I struck my ancle with such violence against a rock that it was several months before it was perfectly recovered  These accidents appeared greatly to entertain Colonel Seyburg while in return I could not help feeling a degree  of indignation at what I considered as unhandsome behaviour but the most extraordinary circumstance was that this disgust between Seyburg and myself seemed to gain me the favour of old Fourgeoud almost as much as if I had destroyed half the rebel negroes in the colony During all this time strong patroles cruized between Magdenberg La Rochelle and the Jew Savannah and on the th the commander in chief marched to Patamaca with nearly the half of his troops leaving  me  the command of those that remained on the mountain for I was not able to accompany him having by this time a dangerous mortification in my ancle  As I had now the prospect of remaining some time at Magdenberg I dispatched Quaco to Paramaribo for provisions and orders to buy me a live goat  Whatever may be thought of Fourgeoud's manoeuvres in not being able to bring the rebels to a pitched battle it is very certain that he exerted himself and his troops to the utmost and that by his constantly traversing the upper parts of the rivers and scouring the skirts of the colony he prevented many depredations on the estates which was undoubtedly a very essential service to the inhabitants though at a dreadful expence of blood and money  Being now the commander in chief at this post the two negroes I have formerly mentioned hunting and fishing for me brought me almost every day one or two  pingos  which are the wild boars formerly mentioned besides a  fish called  newmara  some of which are as large as cod and which I shall afterwards describe With these dainties I regaled all the officers without exception while I gave to the hospital all the plantains bananas oranges and lemons that were occasionally sent me as presents from the  Jacob  and the plantations in Upper Comewina and never was a deputygovernor more universally beloved Patroles were also daily sent out to every quarter and the environs of Magdenberg were so completely scoured that no invasion from the rebels could be practicable These precautions were the more necessary as they had  formerly  surprised and taken by storm different military posts for the sake of ammunition and firearms which are to them of the utmost value and their seizure of the most pernicious consequence to the colony Indeed some posts had not only been attacked and plundered of their stores and ammunition but were actually massacred to a man  Mortified that it was not in my power to take a more active part at present I availed myself of this leisure by taking drawings of every animal reptile or shrub that I thought could illustrate my little collection of natural curiosities which I now began to form some idea of exhibiting to the public if it should be my fate ever more to return to Europe  One of my negroes on the th of this month brought me two curious insects which though I had no opportunity of drawing I will endeavour to describe  The one which seemed to have some small affinity to the grasshopper kind was what is here generally called  spaansejuffer  and is without exception the most singular animal I saw in the colony The body of this surprising creature though not thicker than a quill was no less than seven inches and a half in length including the tail it had no wings and was mounted like a spider on six legs that were near six inches long it had four antennae projecting from its head two being nearly five inches and two much shorter the head was small the eyes large black and prominent and the tail articulated like that of most insects its colour was a brownish green and upon the whole it seemed a monster This creature is found near the marshy places where its long legs appear designed to enable it to wade through the water but not to swim according to Mr Farmine's opinion for which its feet are not calculated as they terminate in two small claws like those of some beetles The other was a large fly which Madam Merian who gives a drawing of it calls the  vielleur  but which I have generally heard called the  scaresleep  by the Dutch These words being extremely applicable from the noise it makes towards the evening which nearly resembles the sound of a cymbal or that of a razorgrinder when at his work This remarkable fly whose grinding noise always begins at sunset or six o'clock is also called the  portelanterne  or  lanternbearer  from the light it diffuses after that time and which is much stronger than that of any of the firefly species  affording sufficient light for almost any purpose these flies are above three inches long and very thick the body green with four transparent wings variegated with little marks of all colours particularly the under wings on which are two large roundish spots not unlike those on the tail feathers of a peacock Beneath the head of this insect is seen an inverted straight trump or tube like a needle with which it is said to suck its food from the flowers With the same instrument it is here supposed to produce that disagreeable loud and grinding noise which I have already noticed But for my own part I should rather ascribe the noise to the fluttering of its transparent wings as is supposed to be the case with some flies in England a large proboscis or snout striped red and yellow and shaped like the first joint of a man's finger projects from the head and makes onethird of the whole animal this protuberance is vulgarly called its lantern and emits that surprising light whence it takes its second name I shall only add that it is a very slow creeper but flies with amazing velocity  On the th my boy Quaco arrived from Paramaribo with the following list of provisions which he had purchased for me In order to give the curious a just idea of the prices in Surinam when things are cheapest I will here insert some articles as charged to my account with the prices in English money calculating at the rate of eleven florins to one pound sterling  These articles were as follow  bacon hams lbs at  d  per lb  small cag of butter lbs at  s    d  per lb  small ditto of flour lbs at  d  per lb  Dutch cheese lbs at  d  per lb  quart bottles of vinegar at  s    d  per quart  lbs spermaceti candles at  s    d  per lb  lbs dried sausages at  s    d  per lb  The prices of wine and spirits I have already mentioned in the twelfth chapter  He also brought me a goat with its kid to supply me with milk for which I paid twenty florins or near two pounds sterling these prices are at least double and some treble to what they used to be in England  Goats are very common in all Guiana they are not large but very beautiful creatures with small horns and very short smooth hair mostly of a duncolour they are as nimble as stags and are kept on all the estates where they breed fast and give much milk they are also delicious eating when killed young  I had now the disagreeable news that all my letters for Europe were sunk on board Captain Visser who was wrecked in the Texel roads among the ice I was also sincerely grieved to hear that my good friend Mr Kennedy with his lady and family had taken their final farewel of the colony and sailed for Holland This gentleman Mr Gordon and a Mr Gourluy were the only Scotch a Mr Buckland a Mr Townsend and Mr  Halfhide the only English and Captain Macneal the only native of Ireland residing in this colony  On the th Colonel Fourgeoud returned with his command from Patamaca much emaciated himself and his men nearly exhausted by fatigue He had left a great number behind him in the hospital at La Rochelle but heard no account whatever of the rebels although he varied his route every time It was therefore pretty evident that they were routed if latterly there had been any settled at all but where to find them in this unbounded forest was the question He however never despaired and seemed as eager to discover the haunts of the rebels as he had been formerly in springing a covey of partridges or discovering a nest of black badgers  On the th Mr Matthew one of our officers who had been out shooting presented me with the  Taibo  an animal that is here called the woodrat This creature was the size of a young hare and of a reddish brown colour being remarkably thin with long limbs a roundish head and a tail not unlike that of a suckingpig the claws were exactly like those of a common rat but larger in proportion and so was the head mouth teeth and whiskers the ears were short and naked the eyes black and prominent with a white iris it is said to run very fast we had it dressed and ate it having been told that it was very good and so we found it sweet tender and even fat notwithstanding its lank appearance This  creature on account of its size reminds me of another animal known in this country by the name of  crabbodago  or the crabbed dog for its matchless ferocity as it kills and devours every thing that comes in its way without exception whether quadrupeds fowls or reptiles and never seeming to be glutted with blood it murders even without being hungry all it can vanquish which on account of its courage activity and strength are not a few though it be not larger than a common cat From what I have said I should apprehend it much resembles the  ichneumon  but still more that animal mentioned by Mr Allemand in the Count de Buffon see Vol IV p which he there calls the  grison  or greyweazel though this that I mention was rather larger and he says that notwithstanding its being a native of Surinam none of the people coming from that country could give any account of it If this be the same animal as I doubt not and have therefore given it the name of the  crabbodago  or grison I am happy to have had it in my power to give the reader some account of it I shall now literally quote the Count's own words as extracted from Mr Allemand which will afford the best proof of its being the same animal when compared with the annexed plate where both the woodrat and the  crabbodago  or grison are represented and had I seen this account during the Count's life I would have most assuredly taken the liberty of informing him by a  letter of what I now though in this unconnected method relate to the public  "I received" says Mr Allemand "the small animal represented in the plate  The Dutch edition Vol XV  In the catalogue it was called the greyweazel from which circumstance I derived the name grison because I knew not how it is denominated in the country where it is found The whole upper part of its body is covered with deep brown hair having white points which gives it a greyish brown colour under the head and neck is a bright grey because the hairs are very short and the white part is of equal length with the brown The muzzle the under part of the body and legs are black which singularly contrasts with the grey colour on the head and neck  "The head of this animal is very large in proportion to its body its ears almost form a semicircle its eyes are large and its mouth is armed with strong grinders and sharp tusks it has six cutting teeth in each jaw four of them hardly rising above the gums Both the fore and hind feet have five toes with yellowish claws the tail is pretty long and terminates in a point  "The grison has a greater resemblance to the weazel than to any other animal but it belongs not to the weazel tribe for its body is not long enough and its  The Wood Rat of Surinam  The Crabbodago or Grisson  legs are too long It is not mentioned by any author or traveller I shewed it to several persons who had lived long in Surinam but none of them knew it hence it either must be a rare animal even in its native country or it must live in deserts and unfrequented places the length of its body is about seven inches I have not been able to learn any thing of its history"  To this I shall only add my surprize It is true that this animal is very rare in Surinam but it probably owes its not being described by naturalists to its extreme ferocity which is without example it being a very uncommon circumstance to take a  crabbodago  or grison alive  Our old commander and I were now inseparable friends to whose board being daily invited he requested me to paint his portrait at full length in his bush equipage which was to be engraved at the expence of the town of Amsterdam and where he thought himself now as great a man as the Duke of Cumberland was in England after the battle of Culloden  Having provided a large sheet of paper and some China ink I began to delineate this wonderful character in his own hut While I was now looking full in his face to examine the features of this first of despots and laughing aloud to think how he and I now sat staring at one another the whole mountain was suddenly shook by a tremendous clap of thunder while the lightning actually scorched the Colonel's forehead and  what is very curious broke all the eggs under a hen that was sitting in a corner of the room where we were engaged The hero's features being recomposed I proceeded and the picture was completed in a short time after to his great satisfaction  About this time the captive rebel September who was taken in the year died of a dropsy Ever since his capture when his companion was shot this poor fellow was obliged to follow Fourgeoud like a dog through all his expeditions the colonel always expecting that this negro would one day or other conduct him to different haunts of the rebelsbut he was mistaken The other negro slaves suspecting that he had actually given some information attributed his dreadful death to a punishment from God for his want of fidelity to his countrymen to whom they supposed he had sworn to be true  The reader may remember that I have stated it in the third Chapter as an invariable article of belief among the African negroes that whoever breaks his oath shall die miserably in this world and be punished for ever in that which is to come  By the d of June the Hope in Comewina was become so very unwholesome for want of cleanliness and being kept free from inundations as it was much neglected by the newlyarrived troops which were now stationed there that the commanding officer and most of his men were rendered unfit for duty by sickness and many of them already buried To this place Colonel Fourgeoud ordered  down Captain Brant to take the command with a fresh supply of men and orders to send not to town but to Magdenberg all the invalids he should relieve These orders he gave to the above officer in such a brutal manner and dispatched him so suddenly that he had not even time to pack up his cloaths while Colonel Seyburg deprived him of his only servant whom he took for himself This usage so much affected Captain Brant that he burst into tears and declared he did not wish longer to survive such galling treatment he then departed to the Hope truly with a broken heart  Upon his arrival he was informed that Captain Brough the late commanding officer was dead This poor man had been on hard service in the woods and being very corpulent could no longer support the fatigues and excessive heat he melted down very fast and a putrid fever at last occasioned his dissolution Captain Brant was soon followed by Colonel Seyburg to the Hope with orders to inspect the sickIn this interval of inaction I shall describe two fishes which though very different in size and colour equally merit particular attention  The first and indeed the only one of the kind I ever saw was caught by an angler It was about the size of a large anchovy and the dorado excepted was certainly the most beautiful coloured fish I ever saw Its back and sides were divided in longitudinal bars of fine yellow and a deep blueish black the belly was silver the eyes were black and gold and the fins a glowing transparent vermilion  its shape was not unlike that of a trout and the whole was covered with small scales it had one dorsal fin on the middle of its back with only the vestige of another near the tail which was forked under its belly were five fins two pectoral two ventral and one behind the anus the under jaw projected before the upper jaw and made its mouth appear reversed the gills were small Having enquired concerning this little fish the only information I could obtain was from a black man who called it  dagofisee  The other is that fine large fish called by the English  rockcod  by the Indians  baroketta  and  newmara  by the negroes which I have several times mentioned but not described they are taken plentifully in all the upper parts of the rivers This fish is the size of a large cod but covered with scales and by some compared to a salmon the back is a brown olive colour the belly is white the head is strong with small eyes of which the pupil is black and the iris grey the mouth is very large and beset with one row of sharp teeth like those of a pike and like it this creature is extremely voracious the tail is obtuse and dark olive as also the fins six in number one dorsal two pectoral two ventral and one abdominal This fish is extremely delicious eating and particularly esteemed by the white inhabitants at Paramaribo where it is very scarce though in the upper parts of the rivers they are taken in great abundance I painted these two fishes very correctly the  dagofish  as  The Freshwater Fish called DagoFissee  The Rock Cod or Newmara  large as life and the  newmara  considerably less The drawings were honoured in Surinam with the epithets of masterly performances  Several officers who kept poultry and hogs at this period lost all the latter in the space of two days being poisoned probably by eating duncane or some other fatal weed that was unknown to us And yet it has been a general observation as I have said before that all animals know by instinct to distinguish their food from their poison  Mr Seyburg now returned from the Hope in triumph with Lieutenant  Dederlin  one of Colonel Fourgeoud's officers guarded by a serjeant and six marines with fixed bayonets for having been wanting in respect as that gentleman pleased to call it  On the th the sick officers and soldiers also arrived from the Hope in barges some of the latter being too ill to bear removing died on the passage without medicines and without assistance One of our surgeons died also this day in camp and a number of the privates died daily This was the consequence of having marched so much in the wet season which was judged however by our chief to be the only season in which he was likely to root the rebels from the forest of Guiana  CHAP XVIII A Tyger taken in the CampFatal Rencounter of a Party with the Rebels who killed several of the Troops and forced the rest backDescription of a Planter of Surinam Contagious Distempers Suicide Scene of primitive Nature  CHAP XVIII  I HAVE just mentioned that several officers kept poultry numbers of which were now taken away every night by some unknown marauder when a Captain Bolts suspecting the  coatimondi  or  crabbodago  made a trap of an empty winechest only by supporting the lid with a stick fixed to a long cord into which having first secured all the other poultry he put a couple of live fowls the whole guarded by two negroes at some distance They had not been many hours on their post when hearing the fowls shriek one negro pulled the rope and the other ran to secure the invader by sitting on the lid when this proved to be actually a young tyger who would yet have cleared his way by beating against the box but that it was immediately secured by strong ropes and drawn along with the prisoner in it to the river where being held under water he was drowned under the most vigorous efforts by beating against the chest to effect his escape Captain Bolts ordered the skin to be taken off which he kept in remembrance of so very strange a circumstance  The Count de Buffon asserts that there are no tygers  in America but animals much resembling them which go by that name I shall however describe them from actual observation as I found them and leave the reader to determine whether they are tygers or not  The first and largest is that called the  jaguar  of Guiana This animal which has by some been represented as a despiseable little creature not larger than a greyhound is on the contrary very fierce strong and dangerous some of them measuring from the nose to the root of the tail not less than six feet and let us not forget the print of that enormous tyger's foot seen by myself in the sand near Patamaca though it may be allowed that creature was of an extraordinary size and the sand very looseThe  jaguar  is of a tawny orange colour and the belly white on the back it is spotted with longitudinal black bars on the sides with irregular rings lightcoloured in the center and all over the rest of the body and the tail the spots are smaller and perfectly black its shape is in every sense like that of the African tyger and being all of the cat kind they need no particular description but their size and strength being so much greater than that little domestic animal they devour a sheep or a goat with the same facility as a cat would kill a mouse or a rat nay cows and horses are not protected from their attacks for these they frequently kill on the plantations and though they cannot carry them off into the forest on account of their weight they tear and mangle them in a dreadful manner only for the sake of the blood with  which this ferocious animal is never glutted It has even happened that the  jaguar  has carried off young negro women at work in the field and too frequently their children This contemptible animal as it is called and misrepresented by some authors will beat down a wild boar with a single stroke of its paw and even seize by the throat the strongest stallion that ever was mounted in Guiana while its savage nature and thirst after blood is such that it cannot be tamed it will on the contrary bite the very hand that feeds it and very often devours its own offspring still this creature is not a match for the  abomasnake  which when it comes within its reach has the power of crushing it to a jelly in but few moments  The next is the  couguar  called in Surinam the  red tyger  This indeed may with more propriety be compared to a greyhound for its shape though not for its size being much larger than the dog which it resembles in make but it is not in general so large and heavy as the  jaguar  The colour of this animal is a reddish brown the breast and belly are a dirty white with long hair and not spotted the tail an earthy colour the extremity black the head is small the body thin the limbs long with tremendous whitish claws the teeth are also very large the eyes prominent and sparkling like stars This creature is equally ferocious with the former  Another of the same species is the  tygercat  which is extremely beautiful This animal is not much larger  The Jaguar or Tiger of Terra Firma  The TigerCat of Surinam  than I have seen some cats in England it is of a yellow colour with small annulated black spots which are white within the belly is a light colour the ears are black with a white spot on each the hair is smooth and the skin is very much esteemed the shape like that of the  tyger  The  tygercat  is a very lively animal with its eyes emitting flashes like lightning but ferocious mischievous and untameable like the rest of the kind  In Guiana is still another of this species called the  jaguanetta  of a blackish colour with still blacker spots but of this last I can say very little having never seen one and indeed the others but very seldom Of the  jaguar  however and the  tygercat  I present the reader with a drawing All these animals have long whiskers like common cats they sometimes climb trees but generally lie in ambush under the verdure whence they bound with uncommon agility on their helpless prey which having murdered they drink the blood warm and never cease to tear and devour it till they are gorged but when no longer animated by hunger they are cowardly and may be put to flight by a common spaniel Of sire also they are exceedingly afraid which is the best guard to keep them at a distance and as such made use of every night by the Indians in Guiana More than once it has been observed that tygers had entered our camps for want of these precautions but fortunately without committing any depredations  As I now seemed to be on a friendly intercourse  with Colonel Fourgeoud I one day presented the old gentleman with a plan and bird'seye view of all the encampment of Magdenberg which pleased him so much that he sent this as he had done the first to the Prince of Orange and the Duke of Brunswick as a specimen of his military manoeuvres c This present had the desired effect for I not only became one of his favourites but declaring his highest esteem for the Scots and English he even promised to recommend me in particular at court I was so satisfied with this change in his behaviour that I now took the blame of all former animosity on myself His attention however was suddenly attracted by affairs of more consequence since on the th of June the news arrived that some rebel huts were discovered near the seaside that Captain Mayland had marched in quest of the enemy with one hundred and forty men of the Society troops and had actually discovered them but in wading through a deep marsh had been first attacked by the negroes who had killed several of his people among whom his nephew a young volunteer wounded more and beaten back the whole detachment after they had already passed the marsh and were mounting fast on the opposite beach to storm the village From this news it was evident that our sable foes were not to be trifled with and since they were thus discovered orders were immediately issued for all the troops that were able to march to keep in readiness  viz  Fourgeoud's  marines the Society regiment and my favourite rangers who wanted no spur and now could hardly be restrained till the others were prepared These troops were to be assembled at a certain place of rendezvous while also a detachment marched to La Rochelle to give information In consequence of these orders all was activity and vigour in the camp in hopes that this decisive stroke would end the war and their misery together and this therefore was the time to lead them on to a spirited attack but for reasons best known to himself our commander delayed his movement till the th of August which was above two months  In the mean time the disagreeable news arrived that Captain Brant was almost dead with a violent illness at the Hope which was at present the place where a number of the troops were quartered though no better than a pesthouse by the inundations and for the command at this place as being one of his favourites Fourgeoud now singled me out declaring that I might thank my sound constitution for bestowing on me this honour From this conduct I plainly discovered that all his friendship was entirely interested and I felt my resentment involuntarily rekindled against him for thus sending me to an inglorious death when he had so fair an opportunity of employing me honourably on actual service  On my arrival at the Hope my orders were to send poor Captain Brant not down to Paramaribo but to Magdenberg This young man however frustrated the tyrannical  command for justly suspecting it he had set out with a tentbarge to town a few hours before I came where he was no sooner carried to his lodgings than he expired from the effects of a burning fever and a broken heart No man could be more regretted than Captain Brant nor did Fourgeoud ever lose a better officer or I a sincerer friend  This being the second commander dead in so short a time I quietly took for my motto  Hodie tibi cras mihi  But I was happily mistaken and continued still as well as ever I was in my life following the advice of old Caramaca and bathing twice a day in the river while I despised shoes and stockings as useless and unnecessary lumber  On the th of June a few days after my arrival I had the honour to receive a visit from the governor Mr Nepveu on his return from his estate Appecappe to Paramaribo with whom I condoled on the loss of his lady who had died very lately I also received daily visits from several planters who complimented me with refreshments from their plantations and here I had an excellent opportunity of acquainting myself with the customs and manner of living of these WestIndia nabobs  A planter in Surinam when he lives on his estate which is but seldom as they mostly prefer the society of Paramaribo gets out of his hammock with the  rising sun  viz  about six o'clock in the morning when he makes his appearance under the piazza of his house where his coffee is ready waiting for him which he generally takes with his pipe instead of toast and butter and there he is attended by half a dozen of the sinest young slaves both male and female of the plantation to serve him at this  sanctumsanctorum  he is next accosted by his overseer who regularly every morning attends at his levee and having made his bows at several yards distance with the most profound respect informs his Greatness what work was done the day before what negroes deserted died fell sick recovered were bought or born and above all things which of them neglected their work affected sickness or had been drunk or absent c the prisoners are generally present being secured by the negrodrivers and instantly tied up to the beams of the piazza or a tree without so much as being heard in their own defence when the flogging begins with men women or children without exception The instruments of torture on these occasions are long hempen whips that cut round at every lash and crack like pistolshot during which they alternately repeat "  Dankee massera  " Thank you master In the mean time he stalks up and down with his overseer affecting not so much as to hear their cries till they are sufficiently mangled when they are untied and ordered to return to their work without so much as a dressing  This ceremony being over the dressy negro a black  surgeon comes to make his report who being dismissed with a hearty curse for  allowing  any slaves to be sick next makes her appearance a superannuated matron with all the young negro children of the estate over whom she is governess these being clean washed in the river clap their hands and cheer in chorus when they are sent away to breakfast on a large platter of rice and plantains and the levee ends with a low bow from the overseer as it begun  His worship now saunters out in his morning dress which consists of a pair of the finest Holland trowsers white silk stockings and red or yellow Morocco slippers the neck of his shirt open and nothing over it a loose flowing nightgown of the finest India chintz excepted On his head is a cotton nightcap as thin as a cobweb and over that an enormous beaver hat that protects his meagre visage from the sun which is already the colour of mahogany while his whole carcase seldom weighs above eight or ten stone being generally exhausted by the climate and dissipation To give a more complete idea of this fine gentleman I in the annexed plate present him to the reader with a pipe in his mouth which almost every where accompanies him and receiving a glass of Madeira wine and water from a female quaderoon slave to refresh him during his walk  Having loitered about his estate or sometimes ridden on horseback to his fields to view his increasing stores he returns about eight o'clock when if he goes abroad he dresses but if not remains just as he is Should the  A Surinam Planter in his Morning Dress  first take place having only exchanged his trowsers for a pair of thin linen or silk breeches he sits down and holding out one foot after the other like a horse going to be shod a negro boy puts on his stockings and shoes which he also buckles while another dresses his hair his wig or shaves his chin and a third is fanning him to keep off the musquitoes Having now shifted he puts on a thin coat and waistcoat all white when under an umbrella carried by a black boy he is conducted to his barge which is in waiting for him with six or eight oars well provided with fruit wine water and tobacco by his overseer who no sooner has seen him depart than he resumes the command with all the usual insolence of office But should this prince not mean to stir from his estate he goes to breakfast about ten o'clock for which a table is spread in the large hall provided with a bacon ham hungbeef fowls or pigeons broiled plantains and sweet cassavas roasted bread butter cheese c with which he drinks strong beer and a glass of Madeira Rhenish or Mozell wine while the cringing overseer sits at the farther end keeping his proper distance both being served by the most beautiful slaves that can be selectedand this is called breaking the poor gentleman's fast  After this he takes a book plays at chess or billiards entertains himself with music c till the heat of the day forces him to return into his cotton hammock to enjoy his meridian nap which he could no more dispense with than a Spaniard with his  fiesta  and in which he rocks to and  fro like a performer on the slackrope till he falls asleep without either bed or covering and during which time he is fanned by a couple of his black attendants to keep him cool c  About three o'clock he awakes by natural instinct when having washed and perfumed himself he sits down to dinner attended as at breakfast by his deputy governor and sable pages where nothing is wanting that the world can afford in a western climate of meat fowls venison fish vegetables fruits c and the most exquisite wines are often squandered in profusion after this a cup of strong coffee and a liqueur finish the repast At six o'clock he is again waited on by his overseer attended as in the morning by negrodrivers and prisoners when the flogging once more having continued for some time and the necessary orders being given for the next day's work the assembly is dismissed and the evening spent with weak punch sangaree cards and tobacco His worship generally begins to yawn about ten or eleven o'clock when he withdraws and is undressed by his sooty pages He then retires to rest where he passes the night in the arms of one or other of his sable sultanas for he always keeps a seraglio till about six in the morning when he again repairs to his piazza walk where his pipe and coffee are waiting for him and where with the rising sun he begins his round of dissipation like a petty monarch as capricious as he is despotic and despiseable  Such absolute power indeed cannot fail to be peculiarly  delightful to a man who in all probability was in his own country Europe a nothing  But in this colony this is too frequently the case where plantations are sold upon credit and left by the absent proprietor to the appraisers who by selling cheap have generally an understanding with the buyer  These are the planters who are the pest of the colony such as the sine gentleman just described who while he lives at the above rate pays nobody under pretence of bad crops mortality amongst the slaves c but like an upstart rascal massacres the negroes by double labour ruins and pillages the estate of all its productions which he clandestinely sells for ready money makes a purse and runs away Exceptions however take place in every circumstance of life and I have known many planters in Surinam as good men as I ever would desire to be acquainted with which I have already mentioned  As for the ladies they indulge themselves just as much by giving way to their unbounded passions and especially to the most relentless barbarity But while I can bear witness to the exalted virtues of such a woman as Mrs Elizabeth Danforth now Mrs Godfrey and a few more whose characters shine with treble lustre I shall draw a veil over all the imperfections too common to their sex in this climate Before I drop this subject however I must attest that hospitality is in no country practised with greater cordiality or with less ceremony a stranger being every where at home and finding his table and his bed  at whatever estate necessity or choice may occasion him to visit This is the more to be regarded as no inns are to be met with in the neighbourhood of any of the Surinam rivers  To vary the subject a little I will now describe three kinds of fish with which I occasionally entertained my friends The  sunfish  the  snakefish  and the  spottedcat  The first frequents both the salt and fresh water like the salmon it is about eighteen or twenty inches long shaped not unlike a kite and being covered over with scales of a golden colour when it swims in clear water darts forth very bright beams from which it has derived its name of the  sunfish  The  snakefish  takes its name from its resemblance to that reptile this is a black eel with a white belly it is not large and is very common in all the rivers The  spottedcat  is called so from its tabby colour and long whiskers this fish is formed not unlike a  pike  with very sharp teeth it has no scales it is extremely fat weighing sometimes above seventy pounds but its flesh is yellow and not esteemed the most delicate food however here excellent fish is seldom wanting such as the  newmara passessee warappa jackee  and many others already noticed The Hope with all this was now truly a most shocking place of residence here I much regretted my former cottage and sweet companion the one in ruins the other at Paramaribo while at present not a man was to be seen without an ague or fever or some other wasting complaint The dysentery  also began to make its appearance and to add to our distress we had neither surgeon medicines nor so much as a light and very little bread left I was moved with the situation of the troops and again distributed all my biscuits lemons oranges sugar wine ducks and fowls amongst the unhappy sufferers with a few spermaceti candles  On the d I sent up to the hospital at Magdenberg two sick officers  Orleigh  and  Francen  with all the privates that could bear to be transported and at the same time I repeated my humble entreaties to be soon relieved from so very disagreeable a situation for the confinement to which there was not the least necessity and requested to be one of the party to march against the rebels but to no purpose while the accounts came from below that a fresh nest of negroes were discovered even close to Paramaribo and the news came from above that the troops there were daily dying away amongst others on the d expired a Captain Seyburg brother to the Colonel This was actually the third captain who died within the space of one month  On the th two fine young officers arrived unfit for service by ruptures occasioned by the slippery state of the ground in the rainy season  This evening one of our marines named Spanknevel was missing and was not found till the th when he was discovered suspended by a nebee to the branch of a tree Not one of his comrades would cut him down he  having hanged himself alledging that to touch him according to their prejudices being Germans would render them as infamous as himself Wherefore by my orders he was taken down and interred by the negroes  An order at last came for my relief and I immediately set out for GoedAccoord in company with Captain Bolts where the planter Mr de Lange and his lady received us with great hospitality This sugar estate being the farthest that is cultivated in Rio Comewina and consequently exposed to the neighbourhood of the rebel negroes makes the slaves liable to their seductions they are therefore treated with peculiar kindness and indulgence to prevent their concurring in any insurrection or being persuaded to leave their present situation  Here we saw a great novelty indeed the young negro women waiting at the table all stark naked as they came into the world I was at first startled at the unusual appearance and asking the cause was modestly answered by the lady of the house that it was ordered so by their mothers and matrons to prevent by such means of detection said they their too early intercourse with the males and childbearing which would spoil their shapes weaken their strength and cramp their growth Indeed finer made figures I never beheld than were both the men witness Philander and the women on this plantation whose beautiful shapes liveliness strength and activity were inferior to no Europeans  Next day we departed for Magdenburg an hour before  sunset against the advice of Mr and Mrs de Lange in a small barge covered only with a loose awning We had not rowed above two miles when not only night came on but we were overtaken by such a shower of rain as had nearly sunk us the boat's gunwale not being more than two inches above the water however by the help of our hats and calibashes we kept her afloat while a negro sat upon the bow holding out a boathook straight before him to prevent us from being overset by inadvertently running in pitch darkness against the roots of magroves c which thickly lined both the banks of the river all the way upwards  In this state of wet and obscurity at ten o'clock at night we came to the Jacob being just afloat and no more for Bolts and I had no sooner leaped on the beach than the boat sunk with all that was in her the slaves luckily swimming ashore Alas amongst the wreck was my poor box with my journal and all my paintings which had cost me above two long years so much labour care and attention I was truly distressed at this loss when a skilful negro dived several times to the bottom and at last brought up my little treasure which though thoroughly soaked I was very happy to have again in my hands Thus ended our shipwreck when having drank some warm grog and slung our hammocks we all fell asleep round a good fire by which I made shift to dry myself and what was of more consequence my papers  The following morning we again set out and rowed for  Magdenberg but about halfway our voyage was once more obstructed by an enormous tree which had accidentally fallen across the Creek so that we could neither drag the boat over nor under it Thus we were again obliged to return to the Jacob whence we now proceeded to Magdenberg on foot through thorns roots brambles and briars and where we finally arrived wet and bloody and my ancle which had been nearly well fresh wounded to the bone the skin and flesh being quite torn away by the numberless obstructions to our steps  Here we were acquainted that Mr Orleigh one of the two officers that I had sent up to Magdenberg from the Hope on the d was no more Thus died almost all our gentlemen who had been during the last month upon the hopeless Hope from which now scarcely one single private returned in health and this I am firmly of opinion was greatly owing to the dry and burning month of June when the sun suddenly scorched them after marching and even sleeping in cold watery swamps and constant heavy showers during the rainy season However I hitherto escaped by the strength of my constitution and good spirits which I determined by every possible means to keep from depression by laughing whistling singing and God forgive me sometimes swearing while all the rest were sighing bewailing and dying around me  CHAP XIX The Troops march to Barbacoeba in the River Cottica Frenzy FeverGratitude in an English SailorDescription of the Government of SurinamSome Account of the Emigrant Americans during the late WarScene of unprecedented Generosity  THE rainy season being again approaching  CHAP XIX  Colonel Fourgeoud having selected all the remaining healthy people who now amounted to but one hundred and eighty in number on the d of July proceeded on his march for Barbacoeba in the river Cottica which spot he appointed for the general rendezvous previous to the grand attack on the rebels Of this party I had the honour to be one but on the surgeon's declaring that I should run the hazard of losing my foot if I marched in the woods I was ordered to remain at Magdenberg with liberty if I soon recovered to join Fourgeoud and make the best of my way to Barbacoeba My limb indeed was now so swelled and my wound so black with the mortification that an amputation was dreaded by Mr Knollaert Fourgeoud's surgeon and I could not even stand without excruciating painI shall bear the mark of it as long as I live  During this confinement I received daily presents from Philander and the other negroes as I was always kind to  them Among these was a dish of mountaincabbage This is the most esteemed of all the various sorts which grow as I have mentioned formerly on the different species of palmtrees this tree grows sometimes near fifty feet high the trunk of a brown colour hard ligneous divided into short joints and pithy within like the elder it is thick in proportion streight and tapering like the mast of a ship near the top the tree assumes a fluted form and a green colour occasioned by the husky tegument that forms the branches which near the summit diverge in a horizontal direction like the crown of a pineapple or ananas These branches are covered over on both sides with strong pinnated leaves about three feet long of a deep green colour and sharp pointed but folded and confusedly intermixed not gracefully drooping like those of the manicole or cocoanut trees The seed is inclosed in a brownish kind of spatha that arises from the center of the branches and hanging downwards consists of small roundish nuts not unlike a bunch of dried grapes but much longer in proportion to their circumference If the cabbage is wanted the whole tree must be cut down when it is divested first of its branches and next of that fluted green husky tegument that forms them after this the heart or cabbage is taken out white and about two or three feet long it is as thick as a man's arm and round like a polished ivory cylinder it is composed of a kind of tender longitudinal white flakes like silk ribbands ready  to form the succeeding green tegument but so close that they form a crisp solid body This when eaten raw is in taste something like the kernel of an almond but is more tender and more delicious when cut in pieces and boiled it eats like cauliflower it may be also peeled in the abovementioned long thin flakes and then it makes an excellent sallad but too much of it whether eaten raw or dressed is unwholesome as it is apt to occasion a diarrhoea It is in the cavity after the cabbage is removed from it that a black beetle deposits its spawn from which the palmtree worms are produced which feed on the remaining tender substance when it begins to rot till they acquire the size already mentioned though those in the manicole tree and other trees of the palm species grow not so large are less sweet and are also differently shaped  The  maureecee  tree by the French called  latanie  is certainly the tallest of all the palmtree species or indeed of any species in the forest of Guiana And I can aver that I have seen some of these trees whose lofty summits appeared to rise no less than a hundred feet from the surface of the earth while the circumference of their trunks was about ten or twelve feet where thickest the trunk of this tree is largest at about onefourth of its height from the root whence it tapers not only upwards but downwards also this singularity has perhaps escaped all other writers It is of a light brown or greycolour and divided in joints all the way upwards to its branches when but at a great height and near the top it diverges in long  green arched branches naked till near their extremity when these again diverge or digitate in long broad leaves of a pale green colour and disposed in an orbicular manner with great regularity not unlike sunbeams or a lady's fan expanded As the young branches spring up from the centre at the summit the old ones fade at the bottom and hang downwards shrivelled and dangling in the wind From the heart of the green leaves the Indians draw out long white fibres or threads as they do from the silkgrass plant these being equally strong serve as cords when twisted to string their bows to make nets or to be used as threads from the middle of the branches appears the seed hanging down also in the form of a large rope of onions I have seen many prints representing palmtrees but I must take the liberty to say that most of them are impositions on the public having either been executed from fancy or from a very bad description but I can assure my readers that all those which I represent were taken from nature and on the spot I speak of the cocoanut tree the manicola the mountaincabbage and the maureecee trees whose branches and leaves are all extremely different from each other and I have not confounded the species as they are in too many publications The two first the reader has already seen and the two others I now offer to his view where  A  is the trunk of the mountaincabbagetree  B  one of its branches separated from the rest and  C  the seed or husky spatha inclosing it  D  is the trunk of the maureeceetree and  E  one of its branches dropping  The Mountain Cabbage Maureecee Tree  down  F  is the beetle that produces the maureecee worms  G  which are not so large nor so delicious as those produced by the mountaincabbage Having had no opportunity of shewing in what manner the Indians and Africans ascend trees by figure  H  I have represented a negro climbing a young maureeceetree to which they do not cling with their arms and legs but taking the trunk between their hands they place the soles of their feet against it and thus walk up in a most astonishing manner by this method they save their skin from the bark but it must certainly require very great strength activity and practice  Having thus far dwelt on the palmtree species I must once more return to domestic occurrences  I have said that all the officers and most of the privates who had lately been stationed at the Hope had died or were sent up dangerously ill while I had escaped the contagion But alas now it became my turn having only had a reprieve and no more for on the th I was seized with the same burning fever that had carried off the rest and even my black boy Quaco was very ill  On the th necessity forced me to give up the command to another officer and depart from this inhospitable spot on my way to Paramaribo I could however reach no farther than Goet Accoord and there on the th all expected my death when an old negro woman found means to make me partake of some buttermilk boiled with some barley and melasses which was the first food  I had tasted since I was taken ill This certainly did me infinite service and the day following I was again able to be transported the black boy also was much better  The evening of the th I reached Fauconberg where I was met by a packet of six or eight letters from different friends accompanied with presents of hungbeef bullocks tongues Madeira porter rum and two gallons of excellent shrub besides a fine bacon ham and a beautiful pointer both the last from the identical Charles Macdonald the English sailor which he had brought me from Virginia in return for the little civility I had formerly shewn him so unexpectedly at the Hope This mark of the poor fellow's gratitude and generosity the true characteristics of a British tar gave me greater pleasure than all the things I received put together But still I must except two letters the one from Mr Lude at Amsterdam and the other from Mr de Graav his administrator at Paramaribo acquainting me finally and to my heartfelt satisfaction that the amiable Joanna and the little boy were at my disposal but at no less a price than two thousand florins amounting with other expences to near two hundred pounds sterling a sum which I was totally unable to raise I already owed the sum of fifty pounds that I had borrowed for the black boy Quaco's redemption but Joanna was to me invaluable and though appraised at onetwentieth part of the whole estate which had been sold for forty thousand florins no  View of Magdenbergh on Tempate Creek  View of Calays the Creek Casaweenica  price could be too dear for a young woman possessing so much excellence provided I could pay it  Solomon well observes  "that as cold water is to a thirsty soul so are good tidings from a distant country"  and this news on its first arrival had indeed the most reviving effect on me but when reflection taught me how impossible it was for me to obtain such a sum of money and while I was employed in giving all the presents I had received except the ham and the dog to Joanna's relations at Fauconberg who loaded me with adorations and caresses I exclaimed with a bitter sigh  "Oh that I could have but found a sum sufficient to purchase every one of their freedoms"  I now found myself though exceedingly weak however so much better that on the next day I went down so far as the estate Bergshove whence the administrator a Mr Gourlay humanely caused me to be transported to Paramaribo in a decent tentbarge with six oars but relapsing I arrived just alive on the evening of the th having past the preceding night on the estate called the Jalosee apparently dead  I cannot leave the river Comewina without presenting the reader with a view of Magdenberg from the Tempatee and a peep at Calais from the Hope at the mouth of the Cosaweenica Creek  Being now in a comfortable lodging at Mr de la Mare's and attended by so good a creature as Joanna I recovered apace and on the th was so well that I was able to walk out for the first time when I dined with Mrs Godefroy  Mr de Graav not being in town to concert matters relative to the emancipation of Joanna who had now once more literally saved my life At this table there was never wanting all the wholesome and refreshing nourishment that I stood in need of with the best of fruits and wines Among the articles conducive to the restoration of health are reckoned in this country all the different kinds of pepper which it affords and the no less efficacious acid of limes Among the first are the  cica  pepper the  lattacaca  and the  dagopeepee  as they are called in Surinam for the negroes name each thing from the resemblance it bears to another but these are known in Europe by the names of Cayenne Pimento and Capsicum The first is properly called Cayenne from the French settlement of that name in Guiana but the name  cica  or  chica  is derived from its round shape and size resembling the insect called  chiga  or  chigoè  already described the next resembles rats excrements c All the above species besides some others grow on low green shrubs they all equally excoriate the mouth have all the same fiery qualities and when ripe are of a scarlet or rather a blood colour The Europeans seldom eat any thing without it but the blacks and especially the Indians swallow it I might say by handfuls not only as a relish but as a remedy in almost every disease  The limes grow on beautiful trees like lemons but the leaf and the fruit are much smaller they are rather a brighter yellow than the lemons have a sine thin shell  and are extremely full of the richest acid that I know which has a particularly fine flavour and is a great blessing to the sick soldiers and sailors in this colony who have them for the trouble of gathering so that it is not uncommon to see the tars employing their leisure time in picking and carrying large hampers full to their vessels In Surinam there are whole hedges of limetrees and all round Paramaribo they grow wild It is much to be lamented that among other articles of luxury this fruit cannot be transported to Europe but whole casks of this juice are frequently sent over and they are also pickled and preserved in large jars by the inhabitants  At the dessert among many other excellent fruits I observed one which is here called the  mammee  apple it grows on a tree about the size of an orangetree with a greycoloured bark the wood is whitish and coarse the leaf very thick polished and of a triangular form without sibres This fruit is nearly round and is about five or six inches in diameter covered with a rusty coarse skin the pulp has the colour and consistency of a carrot enclosing two large stones with bitter kernels but the fruit is of a delicious taste sweet mixed with acid and a smell superior in fragrance to almost any other fruit in the colony There were also nuts of two species usually called pistachios and by the negroes  pinda  one kind of them resembles small chesnuts and these grow in bunches on a tree The others are produced by a shrub and grow under ground both have sweet oily kernels of the last there are two  in one pod they are agreeable eating raw but still better when roasted in hot ashes To illustrate the above descriptions I present the reader with the plate annexed where  A  is a sprig of limes in full ripeness  B  the Cayenne or  cica  pepper  C  the pimento pepper or  lattacaca D  the capsicum called  dagopeepee E  the mammee apple when it is fully ripe  F  the leaf above of a beautiful green  G  the leaf below of a yellowish green  H  the pistachio nut in the husk  I  the ground pistachio in its dried state  K  one of the kernels belonging to the latter  The whole of the above were taken from nature though upon a small scale yet I flatter myself they will be found more perfect copies of the originals than some of Mad Merian's with all their boasted reputationI cannot dismiss this subject without a few other remarks on the incorrectness of this lady's drawings For instance her leaf of the limetree is evidently too round and if by her  palisade branch  in plate XI she means the manicoletree I must declare I never discovered such a leaf among the many thousands I have helped to cut down Her cotton twig and especially the pod containing the cotton are also no true representation of those which are produced in Surinam  In another place she declares that grapes are common in Guianawhich I also must contradict for it is well known that no thinskinned fruit can ever come to perfection in a tropical climate such as grapes cherries currants  Limes Capsieum Mammy Apple c  strawberries plums apricots and peaches nor even common apples or pears  From the above observations I take the liberty to say that allowing Mad Merian due praise for her beautiful and valuable performance upon the whole she has still fallen into very notable mistakes To correct them is a duty incumbent on future observers nor does it by any means imply a general censure on the elegant work in question nor can it appear extraordinary that it should contain some errors when we consider that it is above an hundred years ago since she presented her discoveries to the world In the course of so many years therefore mankind by long experience and continued investigation have become more enlightened and are more accurately informed  Being now once more at Paramaribo it may not be improper to divert our attention for a while from the animal and vegetable productions to the government of this fine colony a topic which I am persuaded some of my readers have long since expected but not having had a previous opportunity of gratifying their curiosity I will no longer delay the necessary information though to some the detail may appear dry and unentertaining  I have already mentioned the nature of the charter and stated that at present twothirds of Surinam belong to the town of Amsterdam and onethird to the West India Company also that the judicial power is exercised by several different courts of judicatureI shall now proceed to describe them in their proper order as delivered  to me by the governor Mr Nepveu The court of policy and criminal justice claims the first rank in the order of precedencethis consists of thirteen members chosen by the votes of the inhabitants and each member continues for life Of this court the governor is president and the commandant or deputy governor first counsellor The acting officers are therefore  The governor  The commandant  The fiscal  The town clerk and  Nine counsellors  To this court belongs the decision of all criminal matters the governor exercising the power of reprieve from death and even pardoning any convict by his own authority  The court of civil justice consists also of thirteen members but these are chosen by the above court only and are renewed every four years The governor is also president here and the officers of this court are  The governor  The fiscal  The townclerk and  Ten counsellors  By this court are decided not only the most important lawsuits but also petty offences  The next is the subaltern college consisting of eleven members chosen also by the governor and court of policy  and like the other renewed every four years the townclerk excepted who sits for life The members are selected from the late counsellors of justice and are  The deputy president  The townclerk and  Nine counsellors  The above court superintends the public buildings streets orangetrees canals c and decides all pecuniary disputes that are under twentyfive guineas any sum above which must be referred to the court of justice  Besides these there is an orphan and insolvent debtors college consisting of  The commissaries  The townclerk  The bookkeeper  The treasurer and  A sworn secretary  The public revenue offices are  The office of importation and exportation duties  The office of excise and small imposts  The office for headmoney or polltax  The office for public sales and vendues  The office for retaking negro deserters c  But these I shall more amply explain when I speak of the general revenue of this colony and for the present shall only consider its government I have formerly mentioned that the governor is at the head not only of the  civil but military departments the other public employments are chiefly  The secretary to his excellency the governor  The commissaries of the victuallingoffices  Four inspectors of the exportation of sugars  One inspector of the melasses hogsheads  One supervisor of all the North American vessels  Two public auctioneers  Two serjeants or messengers of the court  Two sworn landsurveyors  Three measurers of the squared timber  One inspector of the black cattle c  One sworn overseer of weights and measures  Three LowDutch clergymen  One French clergyman  One Lutheran clergyman  Three public schoolmasters c  The militia consists of eleven companies with one captain one lieutenant one second lieutenant one ensign one secretary and one cashier each The captains are generally the sworn appraisers of the estates for sale on the different rivers where they chance to have their department  These are the principal functionaries in the government of Surinam which is not originally upon a bad establishment were it not depraved by sordid avarice to the great detriment of this beautiful settlement in general and to that of its inhabitants in particular The  colony by proper management might be made a garden of Eden not only for the European settlers but also for their African domestics It would not indeed be difficult to suggest improvements nor even to carry them into effect What has occurred to me upon the subject I will candidly state on another occasion and I have no doubt but a little attention even to one single point would be productive of the happiest consequences Thus if I cannot on the spot like the good Samaritan pour the balm into the wound of any one sufferer at least I can leave the prescription which if properly applied would I am persuaded afford relief to the complaints of thousands  I have undertaken the unpleasing task of shewing how by the desperate means of blood the colony was frequently saved from total annihilation How much more glorious would it be for those who have it in their power not only to save the colony of Surinam but many other valuable West India settlements by the help of a WELLPLANNED INSTITUTION OF GENERAL AND IMPARTIAL JUSTICE and the laudable example of humanity and benevolence  Thus much for the political government of Surinam which I will not leave without transcribing its motto so very contrary to what they profess being  "Justitia pietasfides"  The arms are tripartite which I apprehend to be some of those of the house of Somelsdyke the West India company and the town of Amsterdam crowned and supported by two lions rampant and with  these are stamped all their card money c But to proceed with my journal  On the th I met the poor sailor Charles Macdonald and having just bought thirty gallons of Grenada rum I gave him a handsome return for his bacon ham and his dog besides a fine corkscrew motherofpearl set in silver as a keepsake he being to sail the day following for Virginia on board the Peggy Captain Lewis who at my recommendation promised to make him his mate As I am speaking of dogs I must make two general remarks on these animals in Guiana  viz  that in this quarter of the world they lose the faculty or at least the habit of barking and it is a known fact that the native dogs never bark at all In this country it is observed also that dogs are never seized with the hydrophobia at least I never remember to have seen or heard of a mad dog in Surinam and this is the more singular as that dreadful distemper is generally attributed in other countries to the intense heat of the  Caniculares  or dogdays as that appellation sufficiently indicates The Indians or natives of Guiana all keep dogs which they use in hunting they are of a dirty white colour meagre and small with short hair a sharp muzzle and erect ears all these are very dexterous in finding game but they possess all the mischievous qualities of the terrier I ought not to forget that if the American dogs do not bark their howl is very loud on this account my Virginian dog was so troublesome  that he got his brains knocked out by the neighbours within a fortnight after he was in my possession  About this period several  American  families arrived at Paramaribo on account of the war which broke out between the mother country and her colonies For many of these I felt very much and must ever declare that no people could have a better heart or greater friendship for a British individual than they had for me which they shewed on many different occasions  On the d of August Mr de Graav being arrived in town having finally settled affairs with Mr Lolkens the late administrator of Fauconberg I now thought proper to take the first opportunity of settling matters with him by proposing him to give me credit till I should have it in my power to pay the money for which Joanna and my Johnny had been sold to me and which I was determined to save out of my pay if I should exist on bread salt and water though even then this debt could not be discharged in less time than two or three years Providence however interfered and at this moment sent that excellent woman Mrs Godefroy to my assistance for no sooner was she acquainted with my difficult and anxious situation than she sent for me to dine with her when she addressed me in the following terms  "I know good Stedman the present feelings of your heart and the incapacity of an officer from his income only to accomplish such a purpose as the completion of your wishes But know that even in Surinam  virtue will meet with friends Your manly sensibility for that deserving young woman and her child must claim the esteem of all rational persons in spite of malice and folly and so much has this action recommended you to my attention in particular that I should think myself culpable in not patronizing your laudable intentions Permit me then to participate in your happiness and in the future prospect of the virtuous Joanna and her little boy by requesting your acceptance of the sum of  two thousand florins  or any sum you stand in need of with which money go immediately Stedman go and redeem innocence good sense and beauty from the jaws of tyranny oppression and insult"  Seeing me thunderstruck and gazing upon her in a state of stupefaction without the power of speaking she continued with a divine benignity  "Let not your delicacy my friend take the alarm and interfere in this business soldiers and sailors ought ever to be the men of fewest compliments and all I expect from you is that you say not one word more on the subject"  As soon as I recovered I replied  "that I was at a loss how to express my admiration of such benevolence"  I said  "that Joanna who had so frequently preserved my life had certainly merited my eternal affection but that my gratitude could not be less to one who had so generously put me in the way of redeeming that invaluable woman  from slavery"  and concluded with observing  "that I could not now touch a shilling of  the money  but should have the honour to call upon her the next day and immediately retired"  I was no sooner returned home than I acquainted Joanna with all that had happened who bursting into tears called out "  Gado sa bresse da woma  " "God will bless this woman" and insisted that she herself should be mortgaged to Mrs Godefroy till every farthing should be paid she indeed was very anxious to see the emancipation of her boy but till that was done she absolutely refused to accept of her own freedom I shall not here endeavour to paint the contest which I sustained between affection and duty but bluntly say that I yielded to the wish of this so charming creature and whose sentiments endeared her to me still more Thus I instantly drew up a paper declaring my Joanna according to her desire from this day to be the property of Mrs Godefroy till the last farthing of the money she lent me should be repaid and on the following day with the consent of her relations  Without the consent of parents brothers and sisters no respectable slaves are individually sold in Surinam  I conducted her to Mrs Godefroy's house where throwing herself at the feet of that incomparable woman Joanna herself put the paper into her hands but this lady having raised her up no sooner had read the contents than she exclaimed  "Must it be so Then come here my Joanna  I have a spirit to accept of you not as my slave but more as my companion you shall have a house built in my orangegarden with my own slaves to attend you till Providence shall call me away when you shall be perfectly free as indeed you now are the moment you wish to possess your manumission and this you claim both by your extraction and your conduct  I have already mentioned that Joanna was by birth a gentleman's daughter from Holland and her mother's family were most distinguished people on the coast of Africa  "  On these terms and on no other I accepted of the money on the th and carrying it in my hat to Mr de Graav's I laid it on his table demanding a receipt in full and Joanna was transferred from the wretched estate Fauconberg to the protection of the first woman perhaps in all the Dutch WestIndies if not in the world and for which she thanked me with a look that could only be expressed by the COUNTENANCE OF AN ANGEL  Mr de Graav on counting the money addressed me in the following terms  "Stedman two hundred florins of this sum belong to me as administrator Permit me also to have a small share in this happy event by not accepting this dividend as I shall find myself amply paid by the pleasure of having been instrumental in bringing about what seems so much to contribute to the enjoyment of two deserving people"  Having thanked my disinterested friend with an affectionate shake by the hand I immediately returned the  two hundred florins to Mrs Godefroy and all were happy I must not omit as a farther proof of Mrs Godefroy's humane character that on hearing of the dejected situation of the sick at Magdenberg she at this time sent them a present of a whole bargeload of fruit vegetables and refreshments of every kind that the colony could afford for their relief  On the th of April matters being thus far settled I wrote a letter to Mr Lude at Amsterdam to give him intelligence and to thank him for having parted with the  most valuable  property of his estate and my ancle being now pretty well recovered I also wrote to Colonel Fourgeoud that I should have the honour to join him in a few days This letter I directed to Barbacoeba for there he still continued while the intrepid and active militia captain Stoeleman was beating up the woods with a few rangers at another quarter and who this day sent in four captive rebel negroes to Paramaribo  It is a maxim with the rangers to chop off the right hand of every rebel negro they kill for which they receive twentyfive florins and for every one they send in alive fifty florins also for finding a town or village one thousand florins Hollands    On the th finding myself sufficiently recovered and ready once more to enter the forest I bade farewell to my sweet family and friends leaving the first still at Mr de la Mare's at their request and cheerfully set off with a tentboat on my  fifth  campaign in the hopes of accompanying Fourgeoud who having assembled all his remaining forces and made the necessary arrangements to attack  the enemy was now determined to march in a very few days  On the th I arrived with a boat at Barbacoeba in the upper part of the river Cottica where formerly I was when I killed the  aboma  snake I found here the old gentleman who civilly welcomed me ready to start the following day I never saw the troops in such fine spirits or so eager for service which proceeded from different motives as I had said before some in the hopes of plunder some from revenge on the rebels and some from a wish to see the war at an end while I believe in my soul that others were tired of existence by continual illness and hard service and heartily wished for a glorious end of all their miseriesas nothing can be more wretched than a soldier's or a sailor's life perpetually soaking in the wet or scorching in the sun surrounded by an unbounded forest and in a tropical climate  CHAP XX A Rebel Negro described Bushfighting Sentimental Expressions of the African Blacks The Town of GadoSaby taken

whether with a design to brave Fourgeoud or to intimidate his troops being well apprised by their spies that he was at Barbacoeba had the assurance to set fire to all the huts in two different camps which had been left standing by his patroles while they continued shouting and hallooing the whole night within our hearing but this only proved an incentive to action and enraged our veteran commander so much that he now declared he would have ample revenge at all hazards During this night a large tiger also alarmed the camp but did no damage of any kind  An hour before daybreak next morning Colonel Fourgeoud with his troops were ready to march and immediately entered the woods They now amounted exactly to two hundred Europeans fit for service the rest  being ill and unfit for service but no rangers were as yet arrived though they had been expected The fact was they were so much disgusted with Fourgeoud's command that they did not appear at all which afforded this gentleman for once an opportunity of stigmatizing them as a band of pusillanimous rascals and I confess I was myself extremely astonished at this wilful absence of my black favourites who were at other times so eager to rush upon the enemy and had declared their satisfaction at the hopes of a decisive engagement with their fable countrymen  This whole day our course was due E and after proceeding about eight miles which is a great distance in this country where the pioneers with billhooks must constantly open a path we erected huts and encamped Having frequently mentioned the  rebelnegroes  with whom we were now certain to have a rencontre I present the reader with the figure of one of these people upon his guard as alarmed by a rustling amongst the bushes At a distance are supposed a couple of our rangers waiting the moment to take him by surprize This rebel negro is armed with a firelock and a hatchet his hair though woolly may be observed to be plaited close to his head by way of distinction from the rangers or any other straggling negroes who are not yet accepted amongst them his beard is grown to a point like that of all the Africans when they have no opportunity of shaving The principal dress of this man  A Rebel Negro armed Son his guard  consists of a cotton sheet negligently tied across his shoulders which protects him from the weather and serves him also to rest on while he always sleeps under cover in the most obscure places he can find when detached from his companions The rest of his dress is a camisa tied around his loins like a handkerchief his pouch which is made of some animal's skin a few cotton strings for ornament around his ancles and wrists and a superstitious  obia  or amulet tied about his neck in which he places all his confidence The skull and ribs are supposed to be the bones of his enemies scattered upon the sandy savannah  The two rangers who make their appearance at a distance may be distinguished by their  red caps  and here I must observe that the rebels have many times availed themselves of seizing one of these scarlet distinctions which by clapping on their own heads in an engagement has not only saved their lives but given them an opportunity of shooting their enemies  Another stratagem of theirs has sometimes been discovered  viz  that firearms being scarce amongst them numbers have intermixed in the crowd with a  crooked slick  shaped something like a musket and this appearance has more than once had the effect of preventing a proper defence by the plantation slaves when the rebels came to ransack the estates while with this show of armed numbers they have often struck such a panic and so damped the courage of the former that they have  been calmly permitted after burning their houses even to carry away their wives and daughters  On the th we continued our march due E upon a ridge or elevated ground These ridges if I mistake not run generally in this country E and W as do also most of the marshes and swamps Having advanced rather a less distance than we did the day before we were ordered early to sling our hammocks and to sleep without any covering to prevent the enemy from hearing the sound of cutting the trees nor were any fires allowed to be lighted nor a word to be spoken while a strict watch was kept round the camp These in fact were all very necessary precautions but if we were not discovered by the enemy we were almost devoured by the clouds of  gnats  or musquitoes which arose from a neighbouring marsh for my own part I suffered more here than I had even done on board the fatal barges in the upper Cottica as we could make no smoke to drive them away In this situation I saw the poor men dig holes with their bayonets in the earth into which they thrust their heads stopping the entry and covering their necks with their hammocks while they lay with their bellies on the ground To sleep in any other position was absolutely impossible  By the advice of a negro slave I however enjoyed my rest  "Climb" said he "massera with your hammock to the top of the highest tree that is in the camp and there go sleep not a single musquito will disturb you the swarm will be sufficiently attracted by the smell of  the sweating multitude below"  This I immediately tried and slept exalted near one hundred feet above my companions whom I could not see for the myriads of musquitoes below me nor even hear them from the incessant buzzing of these troublesome insects  This was the principal distress of the night while during the day we had frequently been attacked by whole armies of small emmets called here  fireants  from their painful biting These insects are black and very diminutive but live in such amazing multitudes together that their hillocks have sometimes obstructed our passage by their size over which if one chances to pass the feet and legs are instantly covered with innumerable of these creatures which seize the skin with such violence in their pincers that they will sooner suffer the head to be parted from their body than let go their hold The burning pain which they occasion cannot in my opinion proceed from the sharpness of their pincers only but must be owing to some venomous fluid which they infuse or which the wound imbibes from them I can aver that I have seen them make a whole company hop about as if they had been scalded with boiling water  On the th we continued our march still due E till nine o'clock when we altered our course to the N and had to scramble through great quantities of those mataky roots or trumpeters already described which proved that we were descending into the low grounds and indeed the soil soon became very marshy fortunately however though it was now the wet season we had as yet very little rain  This evening we encamped about four o'clock Colonel Fourgeoud being seized with a cold fit of the ague  As I was slinging my hammock between two large branches but not so high as the preceding night my eye chanced to fall upon what I conceived to be the leaf of a tree but which appeared to move and crawl up the trunk I called several officers to see it when a gentleman of the Society exclaimed "  C'est la feuille ambulante  " That is the walking leaf Upon closer examination it proved to be an insect whose wings so perfectly represent a leaf that by many it has been mistaken for a vegetable production This seemed to be a species of grasshopper but covered over with four wings of an oval form and about three inches in length the two uppermost so folded together as to appear exactly like a brown leaf with all the fibres c  I now returned to my hammock where reflecting on all the wonders of nature while the silvermoon glittering through the verdure added beauty to the scene I fell into a profound sleep which I enjoyed till near midnight when we were all awaked in pitch darkness and a heavy shower of rain by the hallooing and shouting of the rebel negroes who discharged several muskets but as the shot did not reach our camp we were extremely astonished the darkness rendering it impossible to form any just idea of their meaning This disturbance continuing till near daybreak made us expect every moment to be surrounded and keep a very sharp lookout  In the morning early we unlashed our hammocks and  marched due N towards the place whence we conjectured the hallooing noise to have proceeded being all much fatigued for want of rest especially Colonel Fourgeoud who could hardly support himself so much was he weakened by the ague We had not marched above two miles I having the vanguard when a  rebel negro  sprang up at my feet from under a shrub where he had been asleep but as we had orders not to fire upon stragglers he escaped running with almost the swiftness of a stag amongst the brambles I no sooner made report to the old hero than swearing he was a spy which I believe was true he shook off his illness and quickened his pace with redoubled vigour but our pursuit was to no purpose at least this day for about one o'clock we got into a bog from which we could hardly extricate ourselves and were forced to return to our last night's encampment missing two privates of the Society troops whom we supposed to have perished in the marsh  This day we saw great quantities of arnottatrees with which this part of the forest abounds In the evening a slave presented me with a  bushspider  of such magnitude that putting him into a casebottle above eight inches high he actually reached the surface with some of his hideous claws whilst the others were resting upon the bottom No creature can be more dreadfully ugly than this enormous spider which the people of Surinam erroneously call the  tarantula  The body is divided in two the posterior part oval and the size of an Orleanplum the forepart square with a figure somewhat  resembling a star upon it This monster has five pair of thick legs with four joints in each is entirely black or dark brown and covered over legs and all with thick and long black hair like some caterpillars while each leg is armed with a crooked yellow nail and from the head project two long teeth with inverted pincers resembling the claw of a crab with which it seizes its prey while its bite if not fatal by the venomous liquid infused into the wound always occasions a fever It has eight eyes like most spiders and feeds on insects of every species nay it is even asserted that young birds do not escape it out of which this spider sucks the blood its web is small but very strong Upon the whole it is such a hideous creature that the very fight of it is sufficient to occasion a tremor of abhorrence even in persons most accustomed to inspect the deformities of nature Innumerable indeed are the pests and dangers to which one is hourly exposed in the woods of this tropical climate and though it is my present business only to make mention of such as I met with in this march and which must appear new to the reader yet a recapitulation of the names only of our numerous plagues may not be improper to refresh the memory of those who have a heart to sympathize with our sufferings I have already mentioned the  musquitoes monpieras patat  and  serapat lice chigoes cockroaches common ants fireants horseflies wild bees  and  spiders  besides the  prickly heat ringworm drygripes putrid fevers boils consaca bloodyflux thorns briars  alligators snakes tigers  c but I have not yet spoken of the  bushworms large ants locusts centipedes scorpions bats  and  flyinglice  the  crassycrassy yaws lethargy leprosy  and  dropsy  with a thousand other grievances that continually annoyed our unhappy troops a particular description of which I must delay till a more suitable opportunity occurs for introducing them into this narrative  Such were the pests that we had to struggle with in this baneful climate whilst our poor men were dying in multitudes without proper assistance unpitied and frequently without a friend to close their eyelids neither coffin nor shell to receive their bones but thrown promiscuously into one pit like heaps of loathsome carrion  On the th we again left our encampment and after keeping a little S marched E till ten o'clock when we were overtaken and joined by a party of one hundred rangers with their conductor Mr  Vinsack  to my great satisfaction At this period we mustered three hundred men and however little Colonel Fourgeoud affected at other times to value these black soldiers he was now not at all displeased with their company upon our near approach to an enemy with whom the rangers were well acquainted and knew how to engage much better than the marines while it will ever be my opinion that one of these free negroes is preferable to half a dozen white men in the forest of Guiana it indeed seems their natural element whilst it is the bane of the Europeans  Colonel Fourgeoud now issued orders for our little army to march in three lines or columns his own regiment in the centre the Society troops on the right the rangers or black soldiers on the left all within hearing of each other with a few  flankers  or riflemen outside the whole thus formed we advanced till about noon when we changed our course from E to N E and continued our march over a  bireebiree  swamp or quagmire these are very common and dangerous in this country being a deep soft miry bog covered over with a thin crust of verdure sufficient in most places to bear the weight of a man and quaking when walked over but should this crust give way whoever breaks it is swallowed up in the chasm where he must inevitably perish if not immediately extricated thus it has frequently happened that men have been seen to sink and have never more been heard of  Quicksands are quite different as they overwhelm by a gradual suction whereas the effects of a quagmire are instantaneous To avoid accidents we opened our files as much as possible which occasioned a very long rear but even with this precaution several men sunk through it as if the ice had broken under their feet and some in my presence up to the armpits but were fortunately though with much difficulty extricated  In the afternoon we passed through two old  cassava  fields which indicated our near approach to the rebel settlement we afterwards fell in with Captain Meyland's  path which we knew by the marks cut upon the trees as before explained The evening being too far advanced to attack the enemy we once more encamped a few miles from the swamp in which Captain Meyland and his party had been defeated  Having had a long march and the men being much fatigued Colonel Fourgeoud allowed during this night both huts and fires which surprized me greatly being so near the rebels though he had forbidden these comforts when we were at a very considerable distance from them I however availed myself of his bounty and having got some  pigeonpeas  from my serjeant which he had picked up in the old cassava grounds and laid hold of one of the kettles I invited him and a captain of the black corps called  Hannibal  to a share who having thrown their saltbeef and ruskbiscuit into the mess with mine and stirred it round with a bayonet we made a very excellent supper though in a sad dreary night and heavy rain  The  pigeon  or  Angola  peas grow on a shrub about eight or ten feet high five or six of these peas are contained in a pod they are flat like lentils and of a reddishbrown colour the negroes are extremely fond of them and cultivate them in their gardens without any expence or much trouble  Hannibal now observing that we should certainly see the enemy tomorrow asked me if I knew in what manner negro engaged against negro Having answered in the negative he gave me the following relation while  smoking his pipe under my hammock  "Massera" said he "both parties are divided in small companies of eight or ten men commanded by a captain with a horn such as this shewing me his by which they do every thing and fight or run away When they fight they separate immediately lie down on the ground and fire at the flash of each other's pans through the trees while each warrior is supported by two negroes unarmed the one to take his place if he is killed and the other to carry away the dead body to prevent its falling into the hands of their adversaries  The negroes have a savage custom of mangling and tearing the dead bodies of their enemies some even devouring part of them with their teeth like the Caribbee Indians  "  From this discourse I perfectly understood his meaning which I have since seen put in practice and for the clearer conception of the reader I have illustrated it with the following plan where the whole engagement is exhibited at one view  The two columns  E  and  F  are supposed to be first engaged where N  o  in the column  E  commences the attack by firing at random in the opposite bushes and instantly retires by shifting his place to N  o  in the column  C  where he reloads while N  o  in the column  F  having fired at the flash of his pan advances in the same manner shifting his station to reload at N  o  in the column  D  and at the flash of whose pan N  o  fires in  E  and receives the fire of N  o  in  F  c c Thus continuing through both lines till N  o  has fired in  F  Manner of Bush fighting by the African Negroes  Gradation of Shades between Europe Africa  when the whole have shifted their stations and the same manoeuvre is continued with the columns  C  and  D  beginning again with the identical numbers c at the top while these lines having shifted their places still the firing is repeated by the lines  A  and  B  and thus  ad infinitum  until by sounding the horn one of the parties gives way in flight and the battle is over I shall only add that when the forest is thick instead of lying on their bellies or kneeling each negro skulks behind a thick tree which serves him as a bulwark and from which he fires at his adversary with more certainty and less danger usually resting his piece against the trunk or in the forked branches like the  Shawanese  and  Delaware  Indians  Captain Hannibal also informed me that the famous chief  Bonny  was supposed to be in person amongst the neighbouring rebels and that he was born in the forest amongst them notwithstanding his being a mulatto which was accounted for by his mother escaping to the woods from the ill treatment of her master by whom she was then pregnant  Having frequently mentioned the different shades between a  black  and a  white  the same plate represents them to the reader at one view From the above two colours the  mulatto  is produced from the mulatto and black the  samboo  from the mulatto and white the  quaderoon  c cThis sable warrior made me also acquainted with the names of several other rebel commanders  against whom he had frequently fought for the Europeans Such as  Quammy  who was the chief of a separate gang and had no connection with the others  Coromantyn Cojo Arico  and  JoliCoeur  the two last being celebrated captains whose revenge was insatiable against the whites particularly  JoliCoeur  's who had I confess great reason as has been already stated The noted rebel negro  Baron  he believed was now serving also under the great chief  Bonny  He next proceeded to tell me the names of the principal rebel settlements some of which were already destroyed some now in view and some of these were only known to us by name These appellations were all very expressive indeed and as they may serve in some measure to elucidate our enquiries concerning the negro nations I have thought proper to give them a place in this narrative with their meaning in an English translation  viz  Boucoo  I shall moulder before I shall be taken  Gado Saby  God only knows me and none else  Cofaay  Come try me if you be men  Tessee See  Take a tasting if you like it  Mele me  Do disturb me if you dare  Boosy Cray  The woods lament for me  Me Salasy  I shall be taken  Kebree me  Hide me O thou surrounding verdure  The others were  Quammi Condre  From Quammi the name of the chief  Pinenburgh  From the pines or manicoletrees which formerly surrounded it  Caro Condre  From the quantity of maize it afforded  Reisee Condre  From the quantity of rice it produced  Such were the names of the negro warriors and their settlements  I now shook hands with Captain Hannibal while my mind being occupied with the hopes of victory unstained by cruelty and being very much fatigued I soon fell profoundly asleep  On the th in the morning no one could awake in a more beautiful day and better spirits than I did until they were damped by observing that at so critical a time and even in the moment before the conflict instead of that kind treatment which it would have been prudent to have shewn to those from whose exertions we were to expect a happy period to our sufferings there was even then such discouragement of the subaltern officers and private men as involuntarily drew from me the reflection That if possible to avoid it  princes  and  ministers  should never invest any one  individual  with unlimited authority especially in a foreign country without being perfectly well acquainted with the rectitude of their moral principles and disposition no men being fit to command but those who are possessed of manly feelings and whose valour is tempered with humanity  since 'tis a truth that sterling bravery is incompatible with a cruel heart  At six o'clock we advanced N E by N towards the marsh my melancholy evaporating with the rising sun  About eight o'clock we entered this formidable swamp and soon found ourselves above our middle in water well prepared nevertheless for the warm reception we expected from the opposite shore as the former party had so fatally experienced After wading above half a mile our grenadiers rapidly mounted the beach with cocked firelocks and bayonets fixed the main body instantly followed and also mounting the beach the whole formed without the smallest opposition We now beheld a spectacle sufficient to shock the most intrepid the ground strewed with skulls bones and ribs still covered with human flesh and besmeared with the blood of those unfortunate men who were killed with Captain Meyland That officer had indeed found means to bury them but the rebels had dug them up for the sake of their cloaths and to mangle the bodies which like ferocious animals they had torn limb from limb Amongst these the fate of  Meyland's nephew  a promising young man was peculiarly affecting He came from the mountains of Switzerland in quest of military preferment and met his fate in a marsh of Surinam just after his landing His bravery was equal to that of his uncle his intrepidity voluntarily exposing himself to danger knew no bounds Such is the enthusiasm of military ambition  "  And 'tis most true  while Time's relentless hand  "With sickly grasp drags others to the tomb  "The  soldier  scorns to wait the dull command  "But springs impatient to a nobler doom  "Tho' on the plain he lies outstretch'd and pale  "Without one friend his stedfast eyes to close  "Yet on his  honour'd corpse  shall many a gale  "Waft the moist fragrance of the weeping rose  "O'er the dread spot the melancholy moon  "Shall pause a while a sadder beam to shed  "And starry night amidst her awful noon  "Sprinkle light dews upon his hallowed head  "There too the solitary bird shall swell  "With longdrawn melody her plaintive throat  "While distant echo from responsive cell  "Shall oft with fading force return the note  "Such recompence be  valour  's due alone"  * * * * * * *  This being the second or third heap of human bones we had met with in our march I frankly acknowledge did not operate upon me as a stimulative to engage with negroes yet these awful relics spurred on the common soldiers to take revenge for the loss of their massacred companions  Having so frequently had occasion to speak of marching through a swamp it may not be improper to illustrate  the description by the  annexed drawing  The first figure represents Colonel Fourgeoud preceded by a negro slave as a guide to give notice by his swimming when the water deepens followed by myself some other officers and marines wading through the marsh above our middle and carrying our arms ammunition and accoutrements above our heads to prevent their being damaged by the wet  In the background may be seen the manner in which the slaves carry all burdens whatever on the head and the mode of the rebel negroes firing upon the troops from the tops of high palmtrees c A march of this nature though occasionally necessary in Surinam must be always very dangerous being exposed to an attack from under cover of the surrounding bushes without having the power of returning the fire more than once for in such a depth of water no soldier can reload his musket without wetting both the lock and the priming  We now followed a kind of footpath made by the enemy which after a little turning led us in a westerly direction Serjeant  Fowler  who preceded the vanguard at this time came to me pale declaring that the sight of the mangled bodies had made him extremely sick and that he felt himself completely disarmed being that moment as it were rivetted to the ground without the power of advancing one single step or knowing how to conceal his tremore I dn'd him for a pitiful scoundrel and had only time to order him to the rear  March thro a swamp or Marsh in Terra firma  "No force no firmness the  pale coward  shews  "He shifts his place his colour comes and goes  "A dropping sweat creeps cold on every part  "Against his bosom beats his quivering heart  "  Terror and death  in his wild eyeballs stare  "With chattering teeth he stands and stiff'ning hair  "And looks a bloodless image of despair"  At ten o'clock we met a small party of the rebels with each a green hamper upon his back they fired at us dropped their bundles and taking to their heels ran back towards their village These we since learned were transporting  rice  to another settlement for their subsistence when they should be expelled from  GadoSaby  the name of this settlement which they daily expected since they had been discovered by the gallant Captain Meyland The green hampers which they call  warimbos  were very curiously plaited with the manicole leaves And when our men cut them open with their sabres there burst forth the most beautiful clean rice that I ever saw which was scattered and trampled under foot as we had no opportunity of carrying it along A little after this we perceived an empty shed where a picquet had been stationed to give notice of any danger but they had precipitately deserted their post We now vigorously redoubled our pace till about noon when two more musket shot were fired at us by another advanced guard of the enemy as a signal to the chief  Bonny  of our approach Major Medler and myself with a few of the  vanguard and a small party of the rangers at this time rushing forward soon came to a fine field of rice and Indian corn we here made a halt for the other troops particularly to give time for our rear to close up some of whom were at least two miles behind us and during which period we might have been cut to pieces the enemy unknown to us having surrounded the field in which we were as we were afterwards informed  In about half an hour the whole body joined us when we instantly proceeded by cutting through a small defile of the wood into which we had no sooner entered than a heavy fire commenced from every side the rebels retiring and we advancing until we arrived in the most beautiful field of ripe rice in the form of an oblong square from which the  rebel town  appeared at a distance in the form of an amphitheatre sheltered from the sun by the foliage of a few lofty trees the whole presenting a  coupd'oeil  romantic and enchanting beyond conception In this field the firing was kept up like one continued peal of thunder for above forty minutes during which time our black warriors behaved with wonderful intrepidity and skill The white soldiers were too eager and fired over one another at random yet I could perceive a few of them act with the utmost coolness and imitate the rangers with great effect amongst these was  now  the oncedaunted Fowler who being roused from his tremor by the firing at the beginning of the onset had rushed to the front and fully  reestablished his character by fighting like a brave fellow by my side until the muzzle of his musket was split by a shot from the enemy which rendered it useless a ball passed through my shirt and grazed the skin of my shoulder Mr Decabanes my lieutenant had the sling of his fusee shot away several others were wounded some mortally but I did not to my surprize observe one instance of  immediate  deathfor which seeming miracle however I shall presently account  This whole field of rice was surrounded and interspersed by the enemy with the large trunks and roots of heavy trees in order to make our approach both difficult and dangerous behind these temporary fortifications the rebels lay lurking and firing upon us with deliberate aim whilst their  bulwarks  certainly protected them in some measure from the effects of our fire we having vast numbers of these fallen trees to scramble over before we could reach the town but we still advanced in defiance of every obstacle and while I admired the masterly manoeuvres of their general I could not help pitying them for their superstition One poor fellow in particular trusting to his  amulet  or charm fancied himself invulnerable he mounted frequently upon one of the trees that lay near us discharged his piece descended to reload and then with equal confidence and the greatest deliberation returned to the charge in my full view till at last a shot from one of my marines named  Valet  broke the bone of his thigh and he fell crawling  for shelter under the very same tree which had supported him just before but the soldier instantly advancing and putting the muzzle of his musket to the rebel's ear blew out his brains while several of his countrymen in spite of their spells and charms shared the same fate  Being now about to enter the town a rebel captain wearing a tarnished goldlaced hat and bearing in his hand a torch of flaming straw seeing their ruin inevitable had the resolution to stay and set the town on fire in our presence which by the dryness of the houses instantly produced a general conflagration when the firing from the woods began gradually to cease This bold and masterly manoeuvre not only prevented that carnage to which the common soldiers in the heat of victory are but too prone but also afforded the enemy an opportunity of retreating with their wives and children and carrying off their most useful effects whilst our pursuit and seizing the spoil were at once frustrated both by the ascending flames and the unfathomable marsh which we soon discovered on all sides to surround us as in the  Maccabees  "Behold the  battle  is before us and behind us and the  water of Jordan  on this side and that side and the  marsh  and  forest  so that there is no place for us to turn aside"  I must indeed confess that within this last hour the continued noise of the firing shouting swearing and hallooing of black and white men mixed together the groans of the wounded and the dying all weltering  in blood and in dust the shrill sound of the negro horns from every quarter and the crackling of the burning village to which if we add the clouds of smoke that every where surrounded us the ascending flames c c formed on the whole such an uncommon scene as I cannot describe and would perhaps not have been unworthy of the pencil of  Hogarth  this scene I have however faintly endeavoured to represent in the  frontispiece  where  I may be seen  after the heat of the action fatigued and dejectedly looking on the body of an unfortunate  rebel negro  who with his musket in his hand lies prostrate at my feet  In short having washed off the dust sweat and blood and having refreshed ourselves with a dram and a bit of bread till the flames subsided we next went to inspect the smoking ruins and found the above town to have consisted of about one hundred houses or huts some of which were two stories high Among the glowing ashes we picked up several trifles that had escaped the flames such as silver spoons and forks which we supposed by the marks BW to have been pillaged from the  Brunswick  estate in Rio Cottica We found also some knives broken china and earthen pots amongst the latter one filled with rice and palmtree worms fell to my share as this wanted no fire to dress the contents and as my appetite was very keen I emptied it in a few minutes and made a very hearty meal Some were afraid this mess had been left behind with a view to poison us but this suspicion  proved however fortunately for me to be without foundation  The silver plate I also purchased from the men that picked it up determined to carry it off as a trophy and I have used it ever since Here we likewise found three skulls fixed upon stakes the mournful relics of some of our own brave people who had been formerly killed but what surprized us most were the heads of two young negroes which seemed as if fresh cut off these we since learned had been executed during the night of the th when we heard the hallooing and the firing for speaking in  our  favour  Having buried all these remains promiscuously in one pit we returned to sling our hammocks under those beautiful and lofty trees which I have already mentioned but here I am sorry to add we found the rangers shockingly employed in playing at bowls with those very heads they had just chopped off from their enemies who deaf to all remonstrance  "Resistless drove the  batter'd skulls  before  "And dash'd and mangled all the brains with gore"  They related that upon reconnoitring the skirts of the surrounding forest they had found quantities of human blood in different places which had flowed from the dead and wounded bodies the rebels had carried away during the action  To reprimand them for this inhuman diversion would  have been useless as they assured us it was  "Condre fassee"  the custom of their country and concluded the horrid sport by kicking and mangling the heads cutting off the lips cheeks ears and noses they even took out the jawbones which they smokedried together with the right hands to carry home as trophies of their victory to their wives and relations That this barbarous custom prevails amongst savages is a wellknown fact which originates from a motive of insatiable revenge And though Colonel Fourgeoud might have prevented their inhumanity by his authority in my opinion he wisely declined it observing that as he could not do it by persuasion to do it by power might break their native spirit and produce no other effect than alienating them from the service so necessary were they to us though so savagely revengeful and so bloody  About three o'clock whilst we were resting from our fatigue we were once more surprised by an attack from a party of the enemy but after exchanging a few shots they were repulsed This unexpected visit however put us more upon our guard during the night so that no fires were allowed to be lighted and double sentinels were placed around the camp Thus situated being overcome by excessive toil and heat I after sunset leaped into my hammock and soon fell fast asleep but in less than two hours my faithful black boy Quaco roused me in the midst of pitch darkness crying  "  Massera massera boosee negro boosee negro  " "Master master the enemy the enemy"  Hearing at the same moment a brisk firing with the balls whistling through the branches I fully concluded that the rebels were in the very midst of our camp Surprised and not perfectly awake I suddenly started up with my fusee cocked and without knowing where I ran first threw down Quaco and next fell down myself over two or three bodies that lay upon the ground and which I imagined to be killed When one of them  "dning me for a son of a bch told me if I moved I was a dead man Colonel Fourgeoud having issued orders for the troops to lie flat on their bellies all the night and not to fire as most of their ammunition had been expended the preceding day"  I took his advice and soon discovered him by his voice to be one of our own grenadiers named  Thomson  In this situation we lay prostrate on our arms until sunrise during which time a most abusive dialogue was carried on indeed between the  rebels  and the  rangers  each party cursing and menacing the other at a very terrible rate the former  "reproaching the rangers as poltroons and traitors to their countrymen and challenging them next day to single combat swearing they only wished to lave their hands in the blood of such scoundrels who had been the principal agents in destroying their flourishing settlement"  The rangers  "dn'd the rebels for a parcel of pitiful skulking rascals whom they would fight one to two in the open  field if they dared but to shew their  ugly  faces"  swearing they had only deserted their masters because they were too lazy to work"  After this they insulted each other by a kind of warwhoop sung victorious songs on both sides and sounded their horns as signals of defiance when the firing commenced once more from the rebel negroes and continued during the night accompanied by their martial voices at intermissions resounding through the woods which echo seemed to answer with redoubled force  At length poor Fourgeoud took a part in the conversation myself and Serjeant Fowler acting as his interpreters by hallooing which created more mirth than I had been witness to for some time he promised them life liberty victuals drink and all they wanted They replied with a loud laugh that they wanted nothing from him characterised him as a halfstarved Frenchman who had run away from his own country and assured him that if he would venture to pay  them  a visit he should return unhurt and not with an empty belly They told us that we were to be pitied more than they that we were  white slaves  hired to be shot at and starved for fourpence a day that they scorned to expend much more of their powder upon such scarecrows but should the planters or overseers dare to enter the woods not a soul of them should ever return any more than the perfidious rangers some of whom might depend upon being massacred that  day or the next and concluded by declaring that  Bonny  should soon be the governor of the colony  After this they tinkled their billhooks fired a volley and gave three cheers which being answered by the rangers the clamour ended and the rebels dispersed with the rising sun  Our fatigue was great yet notwithstanding the length of the contest our loss by the enemies fire was very inconsiderable for which I promised to account and this mystery was now explained when the surgeons dressing the wounded extracted very few leaden bullets but many pebbles coatbuttons and pieces of silver coin which could do us little mischief by penetrating scarcely more than skin deep We also observed that several of the poor rebel negroes who were shot had only the shards of Spawater cans instead of flints which could seldom do execution and it was certainly owing to these circumstances that we came off so well as I have mentioned before yet we were nevertheless not without a number of very dangerous scars and contusions  Inconceivable are the many expedients which these people employ in the woods where in a state of tranquillity they seemed as they boasted to want for nothing being plump and fat at least such as we had an opportunity of observing It should be noticed that  game  and  fish  they catch in great abundance by artificial traps and springs and preserve them by barbacuing while their  fields are even overstocked with rice cassava yams plantains c They make  salt  from the palmtree ashes as the Gentoos do in the East Indies or frequently supply the want of it with red pepper  We here found concealed near the trunk of an old tree a casebottle filled with excellent butter which the rangers told me they made by melting and clarifying the fat of the palmtree worms this fully answers all the purposes of European butter and I found it in fact even more delicious to my taste The  pistachio  or  pinda  nuts they also convert into butter by their oily substance and frequently use them in their broths The palmtree wine they have always in plenty they procure it by making deep incisions of a foot square in the fallen trunk where the juice being collected it soon ferments by the heat of the sun it is not only a cool and agreeable beverage but sufficiently strong to intoxicate The manicole or pinetree affords them materials for building they fabricate pots from clay found near their dwellings the gourd or callebasse tree procures them cups the silk grass plant and maureceetree supplies materials for their hammocks and even a kind of cap grows naturally upon the palmtrees as well as brooms the various kinds of nebee supply the want of ropes fuel they have for cutting and a wood called  beebee  serves for tinder by rubbing two pieces on each other it is also elastic and makes excellent corks candles they can make having plenty of fat and oil and the wild bees afford them wax as well as excellent honey  Cloaths they scorn to wear preferring to go naked in a climate where the warmth of the weather renders every kind of covering an useless incumbrance  They might breed hogs and poultry and keep dogs for hunting and watching them but this they decline from the apprehension of being discovered by their noise as even the crowing of a cock may be heard in the forest at a considerable distanceI shall now once more proceed  The rebels of this settlement being apparently subdued and dispersed Colonel Fourgeoud made it his next business to destroy the surrounding harvest and I received orders to begin the devastation with eighty marines and twenty rangers Thus I cut down all the rice that was growing plentifully in the two abovementioned fields this being done I discovered a third field south of the first which I also demolished and made my report to Fourgeoud with which he appeared highly satisfied In the afternoon Captain  Hamel  was detached with fifty marines and thirty rangers to reconnoitre behind the village and to discover if possible how the rebels could pass to and fro through an unfathomable marsh whilst we were unable to pursue them This officer at length perceived a kind of floating bridge amongst the reeds made of maureceetrees but so constructed that only one man abreast could pass it On this were seated astride a few rebels to defend the communication who instantly sired upon the party but were soon repulsed by the rangers who shot one of them dead but he was carried away by his companions  On the morning of the d our commander ordered a detachment to cross the bridge and go on discovery at all hazards Of this party I led the van We now took the pass without opposition and having all marched or rather scrambled over this defile of floating trees we found ourselves in a large oblong field of cassava and yams in which were about thirty houses  now  deserted being the remains of the old settlement called  Cofaay  In this field we separated into three divisions the better to reconnoitre one marching north one northwest and the third west And here to our astonishment we discovered that the reason of the rebels shouting singing and firing on the night of the th was not only to cover the retreat of their friends by cutting off the pass but by their unremitting noise to prevent us from discovering that they were employed men women and children in preparing warimboes or hampers filled with the finest rice yams and cassava for subsistence during their escape of which they had only left the chaff and refuse for our contemplation  This was certainly such a masterly trait of generalship in a savage people whom we affected to despise as would have done honour to any European commander and has perhaps been seldom equalled by more civilized nations  CHAP XXI Spirited Conduct of the Rangers and RebelsA Skirmish Scene of Brotherly AffectionThe Troops return to BarbacoebaPlan of the Field of ActionA Slave killed by the Oroocookoo Snake  CHAP XXI  COLONEL Fourgeoud on finding himself thus foiled by a naked negro was unable any longer to restrain his resentment and swore aloud he would pursue Bonny to the world's end His ammunition and provisions were however expended and if they had not it would have been in vain now to think of overtaking the enemy To the surprize of most persons our hero however persevered in this impracticable project and dispatched Captain  Bolts  with one hundred men and thirty rangers besides a number of slaves to transport a quantity of shot and a week's provisions from Barbacoeba and at the same time issued orders for the troops to subsist upon half allowance desiring the men to supply the deficiency by picking rice peas and cassava and prepare them in the best way they could for their subsistence and this was also my lot as well as most of the officers while it was no bad scene to see ten or twenty of us with heavy wooden pestles like so many apothecaries beating the rice in a species of mortars cut all along in the hard trunk of a levelled  purperhearttree  by the rebel negroes being the only contrivance used by them to separate the rice from the husk this was however for us a most laborious business the sweat running down our bodies as if we had been bathing while water was at this time the only beverage in the camp  Among other vegetables we had the good fortune to find here great quantities of  wild purslane  which only differs from the common by growing nearer the ground the leaves being less and more of a blackish green this vegetable grows wild in the woods of Guiana and may be either eaten as a sallad or stewed without reserve being not only a cooling and agreeable food but reckoned an excellent antidote against the scurvy  Here were also great quantities of  gourd  or  calebasse  trees which are very useful to the natives of the country This tree grows to the height of a common appletree with large thick pointed leaves the gourds it produces are of different forms and dimensions some being oval some conical and some round growing often to the size of ten or twelve inches in diameter the shell is hard and very smooth covered over with a shining skin or epidermis which becomes brown when the gourd is dry and fit for use the heart or pulp is a pithy substance which is easily extricated by the help of a crooked knife The uses are various to which these gourds are applied they furnish bottles powderflasks cups basons and dishes I seldom travelled without one which served me  as a bason plate c in the forest The negroes generally adorn them by carving on the outer skin many fantastical figures and filling up the vacancies with chalkdust which sometimes has a very pretty effect  The rangers having been out to reconnoitre returned on the afternoon of the d and reported that they had discovered and destroyed another field of rice to the NE This pleased Colonel Fourgeoud very well but when in the dusk of the evening I observed to him that I saw several armed negroes advancing at a distance he turned pale exclaiming "  Nous sommes perdus  " and ordered the whole camp immediately under arms In a few seconds these negroes were near enough to be discerned and we now saw that several of them were carried upon poles in hammocks Fourgeoud then said  "We still are ruined though not the enemy 'tis Captain Bolts beaten back with all his party"  and this proved literally to be the fact when that unfortunate officer having delivered the wounded to the surgeons made his report that having entered the fatal swamp where Captain Meyland had been defeated he was attacked by the enemy from the opposite shore who without hurting a single European had made a dreadful havock amongst his  rangers  that Captain  Valentine  a brave young fellow belonging to that corps whilst sounding his horn to animate his countrymen had it shot away with his pouch also and was himself most desperately wounded in  five  different parts of the body In this situation he was met  by his brother named  Captain Avantage  who upon seeing his mortal condition a scene of such real fraternal affection ensued as is seldom to be observed in a civilized countrykneeling at his side and bending over the mangled Valentine he sucked the blood and gore from his shattered breast and sides then cherished him with the manly promise to revenge his death upon his foes and the hopes that when he himself was killed he should meet him again in  a better place  Colonel Fourgeoud now found that the rebels had kept their promise of massacring the rangers while Captain Bolts reported that some had fired upon his party from the tops of the palmtrees and then sliding down with surprising agility disappeared whilst the rangers were foaming for revenge on their active adversaries and could hardly be restrained from an immediate pursuit through the verdure  Our mighty leader now found his absurd scheme of pursuing the enemy compleatly frustrated and himself in danger of total destruction being cut off from every supply and having neither ammunition nor provisions left in his camp with very few men except the sick and wounded to defend it Thus he at last began most seriously to consider how to secure a safe retreat to which he was urged likewise by the general and incessant murmurings of the troops who were not only almost  starved but indeed dreadfully harassed by daily fatigues and nightly watchings  "They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way they found "no city to dwell in  "Hungry and thirsty their soul fainted within them"  On the th a detachment of one hundred and forty men commanded by two field officers were still ordered to destroy the fields and the old settlement called  Cofaay  of this party I had the honour again to be one We soon performed the service we were sent upon and also picked up out of the marsh several utensils such as teakettles iron pots and pans c that the rebels had formerly pillaged from the estates and had thrown into the water to conceal them from us with an intention no doubt of returning to fish them up as soon as we were gone from GadoSaby  Upon the return of the detachment in the afternoon we immediately decamped and began to retreat for Barbacoeba Here I must remark in Colonel Fourgeoud an instance of  bad policy  at least though many have not hesitated to bestow upon it a harsher epithet This evening upon our return when we entered the ominous swamp he suddenly caught up one of the empty breadboxes and having stuffed a hammock into it he carried it before him as a shield crying aloud to his men  "  Sauve qui peut  "  At this moment a Walloon named  Mattow  stepped up to him and said  "  Mon Colonel  but  few can and I hope fewer still will follow your example Drop your shield and do not intimidate your soldiers one brave man creates others then follow thy Mattow and fear for nothing"  Upon which he instantly threw open his bosom and charging his bayonet was the first that mounted the opposite beach this intrepidity inspired the rest and they passed the marshy swamp without opposition for which act of heroism this private marine was since made a serjeant I should think myself deficient if I did not observe that the Walloons in general behaved with great spirit and were in every respect excellent soldiers This evening we encamped upon the same ground where we had passed the night before the engagement with excessive bad weather and very heavy rain  Early on the morning of the th we again marched and proceeded on our return having now a beaten path before us It will suffice to say that we reached our place of general rendezvous Barbacoeba on the afternoon of the following day but in a most shocking condition the whole of the detachment being mostly spent and wore out with fatigue some nearly starved others mortally wounded whilst all the slaves were employed in carrying the sick and lame in their hammocks on long poles though these poor wretches were scarcely able to support themselvesSuch was the concluding scene of the taking of GadoSaby However if during this expedition we neither captured any of the rebels  nor gained booty we nevertheless rendered the colony a very essential service by rooting out this concealed nest of enemies who being thus discovered and driven away from their capital settlements never think as I have already observed of returning to live near the same spot I might indeed pronounce our victory  almost  decisive I say almost for if we except the demolishing a few plantations for immediate subsistence and from a spirit of revenge the rebels were by being driven from this settlement so disconcerted and panicstruck that from the present period their depredations were certainly less as they soon afterwards retired to an inaccessible depth in the forest where they neither could do any material injury nor be joined by negro deserters  To shew the masterly manoeuvres of our sable foes to more advantage I here present the reader with a plan of this extraordinary settlement together with our different stages after leaving our encampment on the borders of the Cottica River  viz  N  o  and are supposed to be the general rendezvous at Barbacoeba and the two succeeding nights encampment  N  o  The spot where we heard the firing and shouting of the rebels on the night of the th  N  o  The latitude where the troops were joined by the black corps or rangers  N  o  The night's encampment previous to the engagement  N  o  The beach on the opposite side of the marsh where Captain Meyland with his troops had been defeated  N  o  The advanced post of the rebels whence the first shot was fired at the troops  N  o  The field with rice and Indian corn entered without opposition  N  o  The pass or defile in which the firing commenced

surrounded the settlement  N  o  The quagmire or bireebiree adjoining it  N  o  The forest  Having formerly described the manner in which we erected our huts I shall here also add a small plan of  the mode of arranging them during our encampment in the woods of Guiana which camps were generally of a triangular form as being most secure in case of a surprize and the easiest to defend our provisions and ammunition but the situation of the ground would not always permit this and then we encamped in any form square oblong or circular cIn the annexed plan  N  o  Is the hut or shed of Colonel Fourgeoud or the commanding officer in the centre with a sentinel  N  o  The huts of all the other officers in a small triangle surrounding that of the commander in chief  N  o  The angles of the

that Barbacoeba instead of being in a state of sending provisions to GadoSaby as our chief had expected  Plan of the  Principal FIELD of ACTION  between the Rivers COTTICA and MARAWINA with a Sketch of the manner of  Encamping  in the  WOODS of SURINAM  it could scarcely afford daily subsistence to his emaciated troops on their arrival who having for many days lived on rice yams peas and Indian corn were now most violently attacked by the flux for although that kind of nourishment will keep the Indians and negroes strong as horses the Europeans cannot long subsist without animal food which was at this time so very scarce that even the Jew soldiers of the Society troops devoured salt pork as fast as they could catch it  I nevertheless continued among the few that still were healthy which was almost a miracle as I had fared very hard indeed for want of my private stores and which as was mentioned I had left at the neighbouring estate  Mocha  however expecting leave now to bring them in person from that plantation I was in good spirits also But here I was disappointed by Colonel Fourgeoud's declaring he could not spare me one moment while I was able to stand upon my feet I therefore waited patiently for an opportunity of sending for them in the mean time sharing with my black boy the scanty allowance of a private soldier with the casual addition of some mountaincabbage or palmtree worms and perhaps a few warrappa fish  As for the miserable slaves they were so starved that having killed a  Coata  monkey they broiled it with skin hair intestines and all then tore it to pieces with their teeth and devoured it like so many cannibals before it was even half dressed Of this animal they offered me  a limb but hungry as I was my stomach could not relish this kind of venison  A good constitution sterling health and spirits now supported me or I must have sunk under the load of misery and hardships which were at this time become so intolerable that the rangers again forsook the camp and Mr Vinsack their conductor as brave and active a man as ever entered the wood threw up his commission as Mr Mongol had done before during Colonel Fourgeoud's first campaign at the Wana  In the beginning of September the bloody flux raged in the camp to such a degree that the colonel saw himself obliged to send off all the sick officers and privates without exception not to Paramaribo for recovery in the grand hospital that is there but to linger and die on the banks of the rivers where they relieved others to be encamped and undergo a similar wretchedness the sick of his own regiment being dispatched to Magdenburg in the Tempatee Greek and those of the Society troops to Vreedenberg in Cottica  Colonel Fourgeoud's inhumanity to the officers was now actually become such that he would not even permit those who were past recovery a marine to attend them whatever price they offered some of whom I have seen expanded between two trees while the very filth for want of assistance was dropping through their hammocks Of this number was Ensign  Strows  who in this dreadful situation was ordered to be transported in an open boat  to Devil's Harwar where he died At length Colonel Fourgeoud himself was seized with this dreadful malady and his beloved  ptisan  proved to be of no more avail yet he soon recovered by the plentiful use of claret and spices which  he  seldom wanted and which his colleague Seyburg also employed as a preservative of his health though by swallowing too copious doses he frequently lost the use of his reason In such a situation and in such a despicable encampment our commander in chief had the vanity to expect a deputation from the court at Paramaribo with congratulations on his victory in consequence of which he had built an elegant shed and sent for sheep and hogs to entertain thembut the expected deputies never yet arrived  On the th therefore the hogs and sheep were slaughtered and for the  first time  in his life he ordered one pound  per  man bones and all to be distributed among the poor emaciated soldiers indeed the number able to partake of this bounty was at present very small  On the following day a reinforcement of one hundred men arrived from Magdenburg in Comewina and from the Society post Vreedenburg in Cottica nearly as many These confirmed the death of Ensign Strows besides of a great number of privates who had assisted at the taking of  GadoSaby  and who had expired in the boats during their removal from Barbacoeba  Intelligence arrived at the same time that the defeated rebels had actually crossed the river Cottica below Pattamaca  intent on immediate mischief and that they were marching to the westward In consequence of this information a captain and fifty men were immediately detached by water to reconnoitre the banks near the Pinenburg Creek This party returned upon the th and confirmed the intelligence Our indefatigable chief now again determined to pursue them but the slaves who were to carry the ammunition and provisions had been sent home to their masters nothing but skin and bones to be exchanged for others not yet arrived and to be starved in their turn I shall therefore relate what happened the two following days until the arrival of these unfortunate  beasts  of burden for so they might with propriety be called  On the th were sold upon credit and to the highest bidder the effects of the deceased Ensign Strows when the poor soldiers regardless of price and only wishing to obtain some cloaths and refreshments to keep in the vulgar phrase soul and body together actually paid at the rate of per cent and this infamous debt was accordingly stated in their accounts I have seen for instance a private marine pay five shillings for a pound of mouldered tobacco that might be worth sixpence and double the prime value for a pair of old stockings or shoes A sick man paid one guinea for a couple of meagre chickens and for a broken bottlecase to hold his lumber another paid a similar sum Thus were these poor dying halfstarved wretches deprived of the little property they  had earned at the expence of their blood and sweat while this miserable necessity might have been easily prevented by only supplying them with what was their due A private marine of the name of  Sem  at this time swore in the heat of his resentment that he would certainly shoot Fourgeoud whenever he had an opportunity which being overheard upon condition of repentance I bribed the evidence not to inform against him and so literally saved this poor rash fellow from dying on the gallows  Fortunately all the world did not possess this chieftain's insensibility for this day the good Mrs Godefroy once more sent up a flatbottomed barge with a fat ox oranges and plantains for the private soldiers which was accordingly distributed amongst them The same evening a small supply of provisions also arrived for me from Joanna with a few bottles of port wine and though part was stolen and part was damaged by the way it made me very happy and I gave  nothing  to Fourgeoud  When we speak of provisions in the woods we only mean sugar tea coffee Boston biscuit cheese rum ham or a keg of sausages since little else can be carried through the forest by a single slave and we were  now  allowed no more Shirts shoes and stockings were also usually accounted among the necessaries but the last two articles I did not use being accustomed to walk barefooted which I had now practised for more than two years and with great advantage to my limbs when I  compared them with the diseased and ulcerated shanks of my ghastlylooking companions  On the th the fresh supply of slaves being arrived the necessary preparations were made to pursue the rebels the next day directing our first course towards the spot formerly called Jerusalem mentioned in when I commanded the fatal expedition in Upper Cottica and on the th the baggage and provisions being sent before us by water to Jerusalem escorted by the sick officers and privates we at last decamped to follow them and bidding a final farewell to Barbacoeba reentered the woods marching S and S E the whole day then passed the night on the opposite bank of the Cassiporee Creek where we encamped  Nothing could be more diabolically cruel than the persecution of the new slaves during this march not only overloaded and starved but beat like mules or asses by every illtempered individualfor instance I saw Fourgeoud's black favourite Gousary knock down a poor negro slave for  not  taking up his loadand the chief himself knock him down for taking it up  too soon  when the wretch not knowing what to do exclaimed in hopes of pity "  O massera Jesus Christus  " and was actually knocked down a third time by an enthusiast for daring to utter a name with which he was so little acquainted  During the last day's march a large drove of  Warre  hogs or wild boars broke through our line several of them were cut down by our sabres and stabbed with  the bayonets the men having orders from the commander in chief not to fire at any game whatever The animals that were killed were cut in pieces and distributed among the troops which proved though small a very seasonable dainty It is certainly very remarkable that if the first wild boar or leader passes through any danger all the others stupidly follow in hopes of a similar escape which on the contrary as I have said frequently proves the cause of their destruction  On the th we marched S W till about noon and arrived at Jerusalem which the van had reached about an hour before us all thoroughly soaked with mud and heavy rains and several men unhappily with ruptures in the groin by falling over the roots of trees large stones c Here just arrived we found again to my astonishment the identical Mr  Vinsack  with one hundred fresh rangers he had heard it seems of the rebels passing Upper Cottica and had been prevailed upon to resume his command by the governor thus he now once more offered his service to Colonel Fourgeoud who was very happy indeed to accept it  Here our camp being mostly overgrown with long coarse grass one of the slaves was unfortunately bitten in the foot by a small serpent called in Surinam the  This I apprehend is the snake which Dr Bancroft calls the small Labora and which he mentions as having killed a negro in less than five minutes when he was at Demerara  Oroocookoo  snake from its colour which resembles an owl  In less than a minute the man's leg began to swell when he was seized with excruciating pains and soon fell into convulsions One of his companions having killed the snake made the patient drink its gall mixed with half a glass of spirits which I gave him He seemed now perhaps from imagination to bear his misfortune better but the fits soon returned with increasing violence and he was instantly sent to his master's plantation where he expired That the gall of adders  externally  applied is efficacious I have often heard In the Grand Magazine for April may be seen a letter signed J H and dated th March which treats systematically of the application of gall But these investigations I must leave to the learned of the medical profession and only observe in general that the smaller the snake at least in Guiana the more fatal the poison as is justly and beautifully observed by Thomson  " But still more direful he  "The small closelurking minister of fate  "Whose high concocted venom through the veins  "A rapid lightning darts arresting swift  "The vital current"  In this grassy wilderness one of the rangers also killed a snake called the whipsnake from its resemblance to that instrument it was about five feet long and not very much thicker than a swan's quill the belly white and the back a lead colour concerning its bite I can say  nothing I was informed by the negroes but I cannot speak from my own observation that it has the power of giving a very severe stroke with its tail like the lash of a whip which it so much resembles  I must also notice an amphibious animal which some of the negroes killed this evening called by them the  Cabiai  it is a species of water hog and about the ordinary size of the land animal which goes under that name it is covered with grey bristles and armed with a number of very strong teeth it has no tail on each foot it has three toes webbed like those of a duck This animal it is said goes ashore only during the night where it feeds on young grass and other vegetables I have been told it is good food but never tasted it myself  On the th having rested one day at this place Colonel Fourgeoud detached two strong parties to reconnoitre  viz  Lieutenant Colonel de Borgnes with men was sent to the Wana Greek in Upper Cormoetibo and Colonel Seyburg with an equal number was ordered to the Creek Pinenburg in Upper Cottica The latter returned about midnight with two canoes which he had found hauled ashore on the opposite side of the river a little below the mouth of the Claas Creek This convinced us that the rebels were gone westward to plunder and had brought their empty canoes down the Claas Creek from the rice country in order to send them back loaded with booty from the estates they intended to  pillage In consequence therefore of this information the proper preparations were immediately made to pursue them with alacrity Never did the old warrior display more vigour than on this occasion swearing aloud that he now would be revenged of them all  coute qui coute  "Though they dig into hell thence shall mine hand take them though they climb up to heaven thence will I bring them down"  But how far his generalship on this occasion proved to be a match for that of  Bonny  I must beg leave to reserve for the succeeding chapter  CHAP XXII Alarm in the Pirica RiverA Detachment marches to its ReliefAmbuscadeWonderful Effect from the Biting of a BatScene in a QuagmireSketch of the Inquisition and Return of the Troops to Cormoetibo Creek  ON the morning of the th of September  CHAP XXII  just before sunrise Colonel Seyburg marched with one hundred marines and forty rangers who did me the honour to fix upon me as one of the party and was upon the whole so polite and his behaviour so contrary to what it had lately been that I knew not at all in what manner to account for it  Having crossed the Cormoetibo Creek we kept course S W and by S till we approached the river Cottica where we encamped having met with nothing on our first day's march worth describing except a species of  ants  which were no less than one inch in length and perfectly black These insects pillage a tree of all its leaves in a short time which they cut in small pieces the size of a sixpence and carry underground It was indeed entertaining to see a whole army of these creatures crawling perpetually the same way each with his greenleaf in a perpendicular direction So general is the propensity to the marvellous that some have imagined that  this devastation was to feed a blind serpent under ground but the truth is that it serves for nourishment to their young brood who cannot help themselves and are sometimes lodged to the depth of eight feet in the earth Madam Merian says they form themselves in chains from one branch to another while all the others pass over these temporary bridges and that once a year these formidable armies travel from house to house killing all the vermin c that comes in their way neither of which facts ever came within the limits of my observation but that they can bite confoundedly I have found by experience though their attack is not nearly so painful as the bite of that diminutive insect the fireant already described  The following day we proceeded along the banks of the river Cottica till we came near the Claas Creek where I formerly swam across with my sabre in my teeth and early slung our hammocks from whence I was detached with a few rangers to lay in ambuscade in the mouth of the creek till it was dark Here however I discovered nothing except that the rangers were possessed of the same superstition as the rebels with regard to their amulets or  obias  making them invulnerable They told me that the latter mentioned procured them from their priest and that they themselves bought theirs from  Graman Qwacy  a celebrated and cunning old negro whom I shall in a proper place circumstantially describeWhen I asked them  "How came any of you or of your invulnerable  adversaries to be shot"  I was answered  "Because like you Massera they had no faith in the amulet or  obia  "  This piece of policy in Mr Qwacy however had the effect of making all his free countrymen so undauntedly brave that I must confess their valour had often surprized me However this imposition as shall be shewn hereafter besides respect and veneration procured this dealer in magic considerable both ease and wealth which for a black man in Surinam was indeed not very common  In the mouth of this creek I again saw a quantity of nuts floating on the surface of the water such as I have before mentioned when I was informed that they were the real  acajow  or  cashew  nuts which I have partly described to which I shall now add that they grow on the edge of a pulpy substance like a very large pear which is produced on a middlesized tree with a grey bark and large thick leaves This excellent nut will bear to be transported to any part of the globe and keep good for a considerable time it is by some called the  Anacardium Occidentalis  From the tree exudes a transparent gum which when dissolved in water has the consistency of glue  I also tasted here the  etatree apple  of which the negroes seemed extremely fond This tree is of the palm kind with large leaves but is less in size than the maurecee or the mountain cabbagetree The fruit or apples are round and grow in large clusters resembling grapeshot In the middle of each apple is a hard nut in  which is a kernel and this is covered near half an inch thick with an orangecoloured pulp that has a most agreeable acid taste They are seldom used till the apples by ripeness drop from the tree when the Indians steep them in water and by maceration convert them into a most healthy and agreeable beverage  An express on the st arriving by water from Colonel Fourgeoud informing us that the alarmguns  By this meant minuteguns which are fired on the estates when in danger These being regularly answered by the neighbouring plantations soon alarm the whole river and bring assistance from every quarter  had been fired in the river Pirica we instantly crossed to the opposite or west shore of the river Cottica where the rangers with a party of marines were again ordered to lie in ambuscade or under cover in hopes of cutting off the rebels on their retreat when they returned to cross the Cottica river with their booty And this very afternoon a rebel negro was seen with a green hamper who startled by the smell of tobacco for some of the rangers were smoking stopt short of his own accord He was instantly fired at by me and one ranger when the warimbo or hamper dropped to the ground but he himself escaped This bundle we found stuffed with a dozen of the finest table linen a cocked goldlaced hat and a couple of superb India chintz petticoats c the bulk of which I gave to my black companion reserving only the chintzes for another friend at Paramaribo  The free negroes now rushing forwards with unrestrained  valour I asked Colonel Seyburg liberty to follow them and calling for volunteers a great number presented themselves which however the Colonel thought proper to reduce to  four only  with whom he sent me off and having scrambled through thorns and briars woven together like a net or a mat which tore one of my thighs in a terrible manner I overtook them at one mile's distance from the camp shortly after we discovered thirteen fresh huts where the rebels we conjectured had slept but a few nights before In consequence of this I now dispatched a ranger back to Colonel Seyburg to give him intelligence and ask permission for the rangers and myself to march forward to Pirica without delay in hopes to meet the enemy but the answer was a peremptory order instantly to rejoin him with all hands We now returned disgusted back to the camp my sable companions in particular extremely discontented and making many  shrewd  and  sarcastic  remarks  Here we found a reinforcement just arrived from Jerusalem consisting of sixty men black and white with positive orders for us to break up and march early the  next  morning for  Pirica  River while this whole night a strong party lay once more in ambush  Accordingly at six o'clock with the risingsun all was in readiness but by some unaccountable delay it was very late before we left the camp during which time we were informed that a canoe was seen crossing the river with one single negro in it who was no doubt the poor  fellow at whom the ranger and I had fired the preceding day  I cannot here forbear relating a singular circumstance respecting myself  viz  that on waking about four o'clock this morning in my hammock I was extremely alarmed at finding myself weltering in congealed blood and without feeling any pain whatever Having started up and run for the surgeon with a firebrand in one hand and all over besmeared with gore to which if added my pale face short hair and tattered apparel he might well ask the question  "Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd  "Bring with thee airs of Heav'n or blasts from Hell"  The mystery however was that I had been bitten by the  vampire  or  spectre  of Guiana which is also called the  flyingdog  of New Spain and by the Spaniards  perrovolador  this is no other than a bat of a monstrous size that sucks the blood from men and cattle when they are fast asleep even sometimes till they die and as the manner in which they proceed is truly wonderful I shall endeavour to give a distinct account of itKnowing by instinct that the person they intend to attack is in a sound slumber they generally alight near the feet where while the creature continues fanning with his enormous wings which keeps one cool he bites a piece out of the tip of the great toe so very small indeed that the head of a pin could scarcely be received into the wound which is consequently  The Murine Oppossum of Terra Firma  The Vampire or Spectre of Guiana  not painful yet through this orifice he continues to suck the blood until he is obliged to disgorge He then begins again and thus continues sucking and disgorging till he is scarcely able to fly and the sufferer has often been known to sleep from time into eternity Cattle they generally bite in the ear but always in such places where the blood flows spontaneously perhaps in an arterybut this is entering rather on the province of the medical faculty Having applied tobaccoashes as the best remedy and washed the gore from myself and from my hammock I observed several small heaps of congealed blood all round the place where I had lain upon the ground upon examining which the surgeon judged that I had lost at least twelve or fourteen ounces during the night  As I have since had an opportunity of killing one of these bats I cut off his head which I here present to the reader in its natural size and as a great curiosity with the whole figure flying above it on a smaller scale Having measured this creature I found it to be between the tips of the wings thirtytwo inches and a half it is said that some are above three feet though nothing like in size to the bats of Madagascar The colour was a dark brown nearly black but lighter under the belly Its aspect was truly hideous upon the whole but particularly the head which has an erect shining membrane above the nose terminating in a shrivelled point the ears are long rounded and transparent the cutting teeth were four above and six below I saw no tail but a skin in  the middle of which was a tendon It had four toes on each wing with sharp nails divided like the webfoot of a duck  In Vol IV plate the d by the Count do Buffon a but is represented with only three toes on each wing  and on the extremity of each pinion where the toes are joined was a nail or claw to assist it in crawling like those of its hinder feet by which it hangs suspended when asleep to trees rocks roofs c  One of the marines having this morning taken a  murine  or  mouse oppossum  I shall also take the opportunity of describing it and present it to the reader as I designed it from the life This animal differs widely in some particulars from the description of the Count  de Buffon  For instance it was much swifter than any of the oppossums that he speaks of and had the whole tail covered over with hair instead of scales to the best of my remembrance if however my sight deceived me I am not the only erroneous writer on the subject of this animal  Linnaeus Seba  and Mr  Vormeer  with the last of whom I am acquainted consider it as common to both the old and new continent whereas all its species are most assuredly inhabitants of America only Linnaeus is also mistaken when he asserts that all bats have four cutting teeth in each jaw  See Buffon Vol  V  page    This murine oppossum was not more than the size of a very large mouse It was perfectly black except the belly the feet and the extremity of the tail which were all buffcoloured with a buff spot above each eye which  resembled those of a rat the ears were long rounded and transparent its toes were twenty in number one on each foot being placed behind and serving as a thumb It had ten or twelve paps to which the young ones stick fast it is said as soon as produced when they are not larger than small beetles but it wanted that pouch which is common to all other oppossums in place of this there were two longitudinal folds on the inside of each thigh equally adapted to preserve its offspring from every injury which no tortures whatever not even fire will make it forsake I have only to add that it burrows in the ground and often climbs trees but it feeds like a mouse on grain fruits and roots Of the other species I shall defer the description till chance affords me an opportunity  Madam Merion mentions one kind of them which in time of danger carries its young ones upon its back but this animal I confess I never heard of in Surinam and am persuaded of its nonexistence  I have already stated that from some unaccountable delay it was very late this morning before we left the camp we nevertheless all started at last I having the vanguard with the rangers and the poor marines loaded each man with  nine days  provisions on his back In this condition we had not proceeded long when one of the rangers sounding his horn they spread and I among them all instantly falling flat upon the ground with our firelocks cocked and ready to engage but this  however proving to be a false alarm by a stag rushing out through the foliage we soon rose and after marching the whole day through water and mire at three in the afternoon encamped on a high ridge where not a drop of water was to be found till we had dug a hole for that purpose and this was so very thick and muddy that we were obliged to strain it through our neckcloths or shirtsleeves before we could drink it Here I was once more accosted by the Lieutenant Colonel who invited me to some supper in his hut and treated me upon the whole with such very great civility as I could not account for after his former behaviour  On the succeeding day we marched again keeping course W and N W with very heavy rain while I had the rearguard and once more entered on a quagmire which cost me three hours time to bring up the rear to the beach this march being particularly distressing as the negro slaves with their burdens broke through the surface every moment while the loaded marines had enough to do to mind themselves and I too weak by my late loss of blood to afford them any assistance whatever At last approaching the beach I perceived the dead bodies of several rebel negroes scattered on the ground with their heads and righthands chopped off These bodies being fresh induced me to conclude that they must have been very lately killed in some engagement with the troops and rangers stationed on the Pirica riverAnd here I must again remark that had I  been allowed to pursue on the st with the rangers when I was ordered to march back the enemy would have been between two fires in which case few could have escaped and all the plundered spoil must have been retaken The reader will probably recollect a similar instance which occurred two years before when I was stationed at Devil's Harwar Had I at that time been provided with men and ammunition to march I might have rendered the colony a material service These two capital blunders I am sorry to relate but a regard to truth and impartiality obliges me to do it Let not these remarks however six a stigma of cruelty on me in the eyes of the world since no man could more strongly feel at the sight of such manly youths stretched dead among the surrounding foliage and finer bodies than two of them were in particular I never beheld in all my life  "So two young mountain lions nurs'd with blood  "In deep recesses of the gloomy wood  "Rush fearless to the plains and uncontroul'd  "Depopulate the stalls and waste the fold  "Till pierc'd at distance from their native den  "O'erpower'd they fall beneath the force of men  "Prostrate on earth their beauteous bodies lay  "Like mountain firs as tall and straight as they"  While my mind was engaged by these and similar remarks many of my loaded slaves still remained entangled and struggling in the quagmire while the commanding  officer with all the other troops having got on a dry ridge were quite out of sight and out of hearing by which separation the rearguard not only ran the hazard of losing all the provisions and the baggage but of being cut to pieces such was their critical situation  Having not a single European that had sufficient strength remaining to overtake the party which had proceeded I resigned the command to my lieutenant a Mr  de Losrios  and ventured forward alone through the forest till greatly fatigued I overtook them when reporting the situation of the rearguard to Colonel Seyburg I requested  "he would slacken his pace till they were able to extricate themselves and come up from the bog without which I could not be accountable for the consequences"  To this the reply was  "That he would form his camp when he met with good water"  and I instantly returned to the rear where having struggled until it was quite dark in a most distressed and dangerous situation the last man was dragged out of the mud at seven o'clock at night when we slowly proceeded on till we entered the camp  My solicitude for the people powder and provisions instead of procuring me commendation from the person under whose command I then happened to be and who had lately been so very polite brought me now into such difficulties and produced a misunderstanding of such a serious nature and so very distressing to my feelings that it had nearly terminated my existence The reader may  judge of my mortification when I inform him that instead of receiving the approbation of my commander as I certainly deserved I was immediately on my arrival in camp put under an arrest to be tried by a courtmartial for disobedience of orders Colonel Seyburg and I had never been on amicable terms and though during the former part of this march he had treated me with apparent civility yet from this step it was evident that he was my mortal enemy I must not omit that though a prisoner strange to tell I was ordered to carry my own arms and accoutrements till further orders  On the th we took our departure very early and directed our course S and S by W when we passed close by Pinenburg a forsaken rebel village formerly mentionedI still a prisoner in the most dejected spirits  On the following day our course was S W through a matakey or trumpeter morass which was very deep and which we entered when we were all in a violent sweat by advancing too fast while upon the hard ground but the health of our men was not made an object during this expedition though so much wanted to succced  Having got again upon a ridge an accident had now nearly befallen me incomparably greater than all my former misfortunes put together this was no less than having fallen into a deep reverie while I followed the rearguard I imperceptibly wandered away from the troops till I was entirely lost and by myself in an unbounded wilderness Quaco no sooner had missed me than poor fellow at  every hazard he rushed through the wood to recover his master and by a miracle saw me as I was sitting under a tree in the most dejected state of mind that it is possible to conceive immersed in grief and abandoned to despair I had this morning thought myself perfectly unhappy but now would have given the world once more to have been in the same situation Good God entirely cut off from society in a forest surrounded by relentless savages while a deluge of rain poured from the heavens and tigers famine with every woe and every danger stared me in the face Farewell for ever JoannaSuch was the picture of my mind when on discovering the boy I started up from the ground and a new life instantly diffused itself through my whole frame Having now straggled backwards and forwards together for some time I called to the lad that I saw a pool through which the troops seemed to have passed the water being fresh clouded with mud but to my utter disappointment he observed that this puddle was only occasioned by a Tapira  By some called the Hippopotamus of South America which I will describe in a proper place  and shewed me the print of the animal's foot in the surrounding mire At this time the boy shed tears crying "  Massera we deade we deade  " In the midst however of this distress recollecting that by the map the river Pirica was due west from us I determined to lose no more time but to set forwards without delay Thus having fresh primed my fuzee I ordered Quaco to  follow me but again to no purpose my compass being with the troops and not a glimpse of sunshine owing to the heavy rain till the black boy put me in mind that on the south side the bark of the trees was usually most smooth This in fact was a fortunate hint and we proceeded through thick and thin till overcome by fatigue and hunger we both sat down and looked at each other exactly like two victims doomed to execution During this last mournful silence we heard a sound like coughing and the rustling of arms which thank Heaven soon proved to be our own troops luckily for us resting near an old encampment where the pursuing party from the river Pirica had lately lodged At this moment notwithstanding my present situation I enjoyed an extraordinary degree of mental happiness which proves how much all good and evil are only of a relative nature Having now been heartily welcomed by the other officers I partook of some cold beef and bread and a gourd full of grog as did also my poor boy After this regale the party rose and pursuing our march we once more entered a quagmire or rather a mudpool the surface being too thin to carry us through which having waded till it was pitch dark we were obliged to encamp in the very middle of it the troops by slinging their hammocks in the trees one above another and the slaves on temporary rafts made above the surface of the water on which were also placed the powder the victuals c  On the th the good Colonel having now drank his  coffee in his hammock while he kept the troops standing round it in water above their middle a whole hour before daylight we again scrambled forward keeping our course first W and afterwards N W when the road was so excessively bad that many slaves let fall their burdens breaking wetting and spoiling every thing that was in them At last having passed through a second deserted camp we halted on the old  cordon  or path of communication on which I formerly discovered the track of the rebels when I commanded in Cottica river and here having erected slight sheds we passed the night I still a prisoner  At this time a small quadruped running through the camp with incredible swiftness it was cut down by one of the rangers with his sabre This proved to be the  Paca  or  Spotted Cavey  called in Surinam the  Aquatic Hare  This animal is the size of a sucking pig and extremely fat The under jaw is short the nostrils large the eyes black and the ears small and naked It has five toes on each foot a tail like the first joint of a man's thumb and whiskers like a cat the colour is an earthen brown with longitudinal rows of buffcoloured spots the belly is a dirty white the hair all over coarse and short The Paca is an amphibious animal On land it digs up the earth like a hog in quest of food and when in danger flies to the water for its safety notwithstanding this animal is so very plump and heavy it runs swifter than most other animals of its size in South America contrary to the account given of it in the supplement to  The Agouti or Indian Coney  The Paca or Spotted Cavey  the Count de Buffon's description  See Buffon's Natural History Vol V page  where it is said  "not to be nimble to run but seldom and then with a bad grace"  which may all be the case in a domestic state for the Paca is capable of being tamed but he is not sluggish in a state of nature This I know to be true having seen him run like a hare We had this animal dressed for supper and found him even more delicious than the woodrat or even the warrabosena indeed nothing can be better eating than the Paca or spotted Cavy  The longnosed  Cavy  better known by the name of the  Agouti Pacarara  or  Indian Coney  is also very common in Surinam this is the size of a large rabbit its colour is an orange brown the belly yellow the legs black and slender with four toes on the forefeet and three on the hindermost the ears small the eyes a bright black the upper lip divided it has whiskers and its tail is like that of the Paca This animal breeds very fast and suckles its young which are three or four in number in concealed holes of old trees c where it also retires for shelter if pursued but it does not seek its food in the earth like the former The Agouti is easily tamed and feeds on fruits roots nuts c But its flesh though very good is not so delicious as that of the Paca  In Surinam I have been told there is still another species of the Agouti called the  Indian RatConey  on account of its having a long tail This I never saw unless it is the  same animal which I apprehend it to be that I have described under the name of the bushrat  On the th we again broke up and finally arrived in the forenoon and in a forlorn condition at the estate  Soribo  on the river Pirica to defend the plantations against Bonny and his rebel negroes  The river  Pirica  by its many windings is thought to extend about threescore miles It is very deep but narrow and has its banks like all the others lined with fine coffee and sugar plantations its general course is from SE to N W We were scarcely arrived at this post than I was accosted by several deputies from Colonel Seyburg who earnestly intreated that I would only acknowledge myself to have been in fault assuring me that I should then be set at liberty and all would be forgotten As I was conscious however of my own innocence I could not in common justice criminate myself in an instance where even my alledged crime amounted to no more than an anxious solicitude for the poor men and the provisions who were entrusted to my care I was therefore placed under the guard of a sentinel for what my commander was pleased to term unpliant stubbornness  and disarmed  In the mean time the marines caused me fresh uneasiness and of the most poignant kind by loudly threatening to mutiny in my behalf nor could any thing have prevented them but my decisive declaration that as no cause could justify military disobedience and rebellion I should be under the necessity myself however injurious  to my feelings of taking an active part against them and seeing the ringleaders brought to condign punishment I felt that at this time I could war with all the world and nearly with myselfmy heart was breaking apacemy life became a burden  "Dependants friends relations love himself  "  Savag'd by woe  forget the tender tie  "The sweet engagements of the feeling heart"  The day after our arrival in this station we received the particulars of the Pirica news which were that on the th the estates  Schoonhove  and  Altona  had been pillaged by the rebels whom we had routed at GadoSaby but that at the plantation  Poelwyk  they had been beaten back by the slaves that the rangers stationed at an estate called  Hagenbos  had pursued them on the st overtaken them on the d killed several and brought back most of the booty that on the same day another party of the rebels had made an attempt to seize the powder magazine at Hagenbos which was no bad plan but that while the rangers were in pursuit of their associates they had been repulsed by the manly behaviour of a few armed slaves one of whom belonging to the estate  Timotibo  took an armed rebel himself and next discovered their camp at the back of his master's plantations for which he was handsomely rewarded From all which intelligence there was now no doubt remaining that if Seyburg's detached party on the th had marched  forwards instead of backwards by his orders the above mischief might have been prevented and the enterprize of the rebels entirely frustrated It was also evident from this narrative that the man whom we fired at on the st was certainly one of the plunderers on the th and that the bodies found dead on the d had been shot the very same day  On the th among other fruits some dates were sent to me by a Society officer This tree is also of the Palmeto species but not extremely high its leaves diverge from its summit very thick hanging down in the form of an umbrella The dates appear in large clusters being an oblong thin fruit like a man's thumb of a yellow colour and the pulp which is fat firm and sweet adheres to a hard greyishcoloured stone with longitudinal furrowsI ought not to omit mentioning that this day sixty rangers going to reconnoitre discovered the old rebel camp at the back of Timotibo which seemed to have contained about sixty armed men  On the morning of the th of September having nothing more to do in the neighbourhood of the Pirica River we left it and on the st of October came to Devil's Harwar much fatigued nothing remarkable having happened on our march I had written on the preceding day to Colonel Fourgeoud informing him that I was weary of existence in my present state and requesting that a courtmartial might be  immediately  called and this letter I had sent by a slave to the commander in chief  On our arrival at this station I indeed found every hard means employed to bring me to terms and such was the severe usage I experienced that one of the rangers called  Captain Quaci  exclaimed  "If in this manner these Europeans treat one another is it to be wondered at that they should take a pleasure in torturing us poor Africans"  At Devil's Harwar however my stormy voyage drew to a conclusion Colonel Seyburg was evidently convinced that he was wrong and knowing what must follow now only wished for a handsome opportunity of extricating himself from the effects of his unmanly passion On the d of October therefore he asked me with a smile  "If I had a heart to forget and forgive"  To which I sternly answered  "No"  He repeated the question I then said  "I venerated truth and would never confess myself in an error unless my heart coincided in the acknowledgmentthat this was a concession I would make to no man living and least of all to him"  He here grasped my hand begged me to be pacified and declared  "That he would make peace on any terms"  but I again drew back with contempt and decidedly avowed  "That I could not agree to any compromise unless he owned  his fault  in the presence of all the officers with his own hands tearing from his journal every sentence that could reflect upon my character"  The journals were immediately produced my arms were returned me and my triumph was attended with every  circumstance that could add to my  full satisfaction  I then frankly and sincerely gave my hand to Colonel Seyburg who gave a feast in honour of our reconciliation and after dinner to my utter surprize produced the  letter  which I had written to Colonel Fourgeoud which he acknowledged he had intercepted to prevent the affair proceeding to extremities at the same time he acquainted me that Fourgeoud was encamped at the Wana Creek instead of Lieutenant Colonel de Borgnes who had fallen sick and was gone to Paramaribo A perfect reconciliation having taken place and every thing being now adjusted while the troops having had some rest we set out once more on the th for the head quarters at Jerusalem but I was obliged to leave poor Quaco who was very ill at Devil's Harwar under care of the surgeon and that evening we encamped opposite the mouth of the Cormoetibo Creek  On the following morning early having crossed the River Cottica the troops marched back to Jerusalem where I now had leisure to reflect on the various evils which besal poor mortals as well those who are innocent of the difficulties they are brought into as those which are the greater part who have brought themselves into distress and even despair by their own indiscretions These reflections arose from finding here among others a newlyarrived acquaintance a Mr Ptr who having squandered away in Europe above  thirty thousand  pounds and lost a beautiful wife by elopement was now  reduced to the income of an ensign in the Society troops This gentleman having formerly possessed considerable property in this very colony his present situation could not but be assuredly the more galling on that account Alas unhappy young fellow well might you exclaim  "Privé de tout mes biens  "Dans un climat funeste  "Je t'adore te perds  "Le poignard seul me reste  "Mais Oh je suis Ptr  "Reservé pour souffrir  "Je sçaurois vivre encore  "Et faire plus que mourir"  These are the words which he spouted with a sigh throwing the last silver he had left among the slaves and indeed nothing could be more applicable to himself than the lines he quoted or more lamentable than this poor devil's forlorn condition which however created in me during my present humour no other effect than a loud and immoderate fit of laughter  CHAP XXIII Second

FamineMisery  CHAP XXIII  ON the th of October Colonel Fourgeoud broke up the encampment at the Wana Creek to join us at Jerusalem having sent down the half of his party sick in barges and their number being greatly augmented by the invalids from this place they were all together transported to receive the  coupdegrace  in the hospital at Devil's Harwar The rangers also took their leave and marched with Mr Vinsack their conductor to guard the Pirica River  Fourgeoud during his last cruize had discovered a hundred empty houses and seen some straggling rebels but he had taken none He had also found a scalp fixed to the branch of a tree which we justly conjectured to be the remains of the unfortunate  Schmidt  who was lost  This was the more surprising as we were at peace with all the  Indians  and scalping was never practised by the  negroes    On the th my black boy Quaco being perfectly recovered  arrived to my great satisfaction as his fidelity to me was so steady and unshaken At the same time we received an account that Captain Stoelman with some rangers had discovered a fresh settlement of the rebels by a great smoke appearing at a distance in the forest but had not yet attacked them that Captain Fredericy with a party of black volunteers was scouring the seaside below Paramaribo that the two men we had lost on the th of August had miraculously escaped and found their way to the post at the river Marawina and that no less than twelve fine negro slaves had just deserted from the  Gold Mine  estate to join the rebels  This news so much exasperated Colonel Fourgeoud that the indefatigable man again determined to persevere in pursuing his enemies We accordingly entered the woods very early on the morning of the th although he and his little army were at this time greatly reduced He buried but the evening before one of his countrymen a volunteer called  Matthew  and brother to the ensign but death was now become so familiar to us that upon losing a friend or relation the first question generally was  "Has he left any brandy rum or tobacco"    "Pauvre Laurant" said I to his shrivelled valetdechambre "the brave Fourgcoud is like fire he is to the colony an excellent servant indeed but I think to both you and myself but a roughish master"  The poor fellow shrugging up his shoulders replied with a grin and a heavy sigh  "  Oui par ma foi  "  and then treated  me with a pinch of his snuff I must not omit that a little before our departure seven more of our negro slaves did desert us who went home to their masters perfectly brokenhearted emaciated and nearly starved however we proceeded and marched directly N E during which nothing happened except my box with all my bottles being dashed to pieces and in the evening we encamped though  then  unknown to us near the Cassipore Creek where the dry season having commenced we dug a pit for water Orders were also issued to the troops no more to build huts sheds c as the rains were now less violent  On the th we continued our route marching N E as before and towards the evening arrived at the houses which Colonel Fourgeoud had lately discovered which proved since to be only a temporary settlement erected by the rebels as a shelter or asylum in their expected retreat before they were dislodged from GadoSaby and to this little settlement they had given the name of  Boossy Cry  that is "the woods lament" Here we encamped and took much notice of Bonny's house in particular which was built like a watering machine being elevated from the ground with two doors so that he might the better observe all around him and prevent his being taken by surprize it also had more air and of course was better calculated for his health he having in some late action received a very dangerous wound in the groin as we afterwards learned from a rebel negro prisoner Near to  Bonny's house were the private baths where his women washed themselves morning and evening there being no river near this settlement  In this encampment one of our slaves presented me with a  landturtle  which indeed we had met with several times before but as I have never described this animal I will now endeavour to give some account of it The landturtle of Surinam is not more than eighteen or twenty inches in length and of an oval form the shell is more convex than that of the seaturtle and marked with thirteen elevated hexangular shields dark brown and yellow so hard that it will bear almost any weight without breaking the under shell is a little concave and of a light yellow the head of this animal resembles that of other turtles the tail is naked and short but instead of fins or swimmers it has four feet covered with scales and armed with sharp claws to assist it in crawling over the ground When this poor creature sees any danger it instantly shrinks within its shell In this situation the Indians put it on the fire where they broil it until it is drest which is known by the under shell separating from the upper which serves for a dish to hold the contents A less barbarous way and the way which I always followed is only to provoke the animal by the heat of the embers to run away when stretching out its head and neck they are easily chopped off and the food extracted without additional torture I have known Mr de Graaf keep three or four of these landturtles for above four  months for transportation during which time they lived without any apparent nourishment whatever yet still remained vigorous and even prone to copulation  Another kind of landturtle called here the  arlacacca  I have often seen this is less in circumference very flat of a disagreeable greenish colour and nothing like so good as the former  On the th we continued our march N and N E in hopes of more discoveries but without success We this day passed some anthillocks above six feet high and without exaggeration above one hundred feet in circumference We also saw great quantities of valuable timber and among the rest the  blackcabbage  tree the wood of which is of a deep brown and is in high estimation among carpenters and joiners The  sandhooker  tree was likewise shewn me which receives its name from the fruit which being divested of its seed is used as a sandbox by writers It is of the shape of a large onion with small holes in the surface the seed is both laxative and emetic but the juice of the pulp is a fatal poison More than this I cannot say having had neither the time nor the power of examining it with the accuracy of a professed botanist  On the th we continued the same course for a few hours longer when we found a beaten path which though circuitous seemed to be a communication between GadoSaby and BoossyCry We followed this path which led us due W for a few hours when a poor  rebel negro was found by me covered with branches of the manicoletree and indeed barely alive being in appearance nothing but skin and bone with one of his eyes almost beaten out of the socket I put my bottle to his mouth he swallowed a few drops of rum and water and said with a faint voice which we could scarcely hear "Dank ye me Massera" but could articulate nothing more Fourgeoud ordered this man to be carried with us in a hammock and we soon afterwards encamped near a bireebiree swamp or quagmire I ought not to forget that this day we saw some very fine  locusttrees  being eighty or a hundred feet high and prodigiously thick the trunk is grey and very straight with no branches till near the top on which the leaves are disposed two to each stem this is justly called the king of the forest for a finer tree cannot be found The timber is of a beautiful cinnamoncolour and possesses every desireable quality of gravity polish grain and durabilityBut what particularly attracted our notice was its seed like beans three or four in number enclosed in a broad lightbrown pod that lay scattered in quantities at the root of the tree upon the ground and tasted like some kinds of gingerbread From the root of this tree a gum exudes which properly prepared affords a varnish hitherto unequalled for transparency and effect  Innumerable indeed are the various fine trees that this country produces and which may be had for the cutting yet when we consider the distance they usually grow from navigable rivers the great labour in felling and  working them the vast number of slaves required to drag them through the forest where no horses can be employed besides the danger and loss of time we may easily account for the enormous price generally paid for the best timber in Guiana  This march undoubtedly afforded us the most enchanting prospects that can be imagined in a luxuriant and evergreen forest while the dry season contributed greatly to beautify the scene and simple nature by far outshone the most strenuous endeavours of art Here we met with immense savannas of the most lovely verdure interspersed with meandring brooks of water cool and clear as rock crystal their borders adorned with flowers of every lively hue and fragrance In some places we observed small clumps of elegant shrubs or perhaps a single tree whose beauty would almost induce one to think they had been designedly left growing to enrich the scene The whole surrounded by a vast wood of lofty palmtrees waving their seagreen foliage above the variegated copse of neverfading verdure blossom and fruit as if to invite the panting wanderer under its cooling shade till in the later hours he might enjoy the bracing pleasures of the limpid flood and contemplate nature's beauties undisturbedWhen universal silence reigned every where around how often have I thought on my  dear friend  and wished with her to glide through life in these Elysian fieldsBut I must wave the pleasing recollection  On the th we again marched and fell in with our  old path which we followed leading directly to the fields of GadoSaby where quantities of rice once more appeared in full bloom which we cut down and burned to ashes Here perceiving the poor rebel negro hopeless of recovery not absolutely to bury him alive he was overspread with moss leaves and green boughs after which we slung our hammocks being almost choaked with smoke  In these fields I saw a lizard above two feet long which the negro slaves killed and ate they called it  sapagala  it was of a brownish green colour but did not resemble the iguana Among the ruins of the consumed town we discovered some  scolopendras  or centipedes no less than eight or ten inches in length this odious reptile is of a yellowishbrown colour walks very fast backwards or forwards and bites so severely that the venom it infuses though not deemed fatal generally produces a fever Some writers assign this reptile twenty pair of legs others forty I never reckoned them and can only observe that they appeared to me exactly to resemble the centipedes in Europe Some of our gentlemen formed large collections of these curiosities which were very valuable whilst I contented myself with the drawings and descriptions only of those I thought most uncommon  On the th we marched to visit  Cofaay  when I perceiving the unhappy negro captive still alive after removing the branches he was at my earnest intercession once more carried along with us but the slaves being  discontented with such a load took every opportunity in my absence of torturing him by knocking him against roots and stones and dragging him through mud and water as they went along Different patroles were now ordered out to reconnoitre the grounds while the remainder of the troops encamped in the  west  part of Cofaay and these patroles discovered no less than four beautiful fields in one chain situated due west from Cofaay well stocked with cassava yams plantains pistachio nuts with maize and pigeon peas also were seen several human carcases the relicts of our late engagements in August We found here a species of  medlars  of a crimson colour and of a taste very much like that of strawberries This fruit grows on a large green shrub and is cultivated in many gardens at Paramaribo We also met with a kind of wild plumtree called  monpe  the fruit is yellow oblong and small the stone is large the pulp thin and though of a sharp acid has an agreeable flavour  On the morning of the st all these and every useful vegetable were cut down and again destroyed by fire after which returning to our last night's camp we found it also in flames and were obliged to sling our hammocks in the  east  skirts of the woods Here recollecting that the poor disabled rebel was left alone I ran back  west  to the burning camp to afford him assistance but after seeking him in vain through clouds of smoke and darkness I was forced to consult my own safety by hastily returning  to my companions some blaming me much for my temerity others damning the  skeleton  whether dead or alive  The devastation being now compleated we marched back to Jerusalem where on the th we arrived perfectly exhausted and Fourgeoud at last so ill with a phrenzy fever that he was confined to his hammock with small hopes of surviving the night But he however still continued to command and the next morning ordered a marine to be bastonaded for asking shoes although he was barefooted and his feet tore to pieces while another was flogged for coughing who had a severe cold a captain was dismissed from actual service and confined in Fort Zealandia for having dared to marry without his consentSickness and death now raged through the camp and every thing was in the utmost confusion  To compleat the whole on the st of November twentyfive more negro slaves ran away and on the d we received intelligence that no less than fifty armed rebels had been seen swimming across the River Cottica about a musketshot above Barbacoeba  In consequence of this information Colonel Seyburg was detached with the few men that remained able to carry arms who through distress and famine were now almost ready to attack their own officers and who being unsupplied with their favourite luxury tobacco  All sailors soldiers and negroes are particularly miserable without tobacco it keeps up their spirits they say and some  almost  prefer it to bread  sat  smoking grey paper and chewing leaves and leather as a substitute for the want of it Few men however were worse off than I was at this time since having neither provisions nor cloaths I was almost naked as well as starved with a running ulcer in my left foot ever since the ambuscade and march to Pirica nor had I a friend in the camp who could give me the smallest assistance To compleat my misery the little blood I had remaining was in  two  successive nights again nearly sucked away by the vampirebat or spectre thus I fainted away in my hammock and was almost sorry to recover particularly upon being informed by a letter that Joanna and her boy were dying with a putrid fever at Paramaribo  At last on the th Serjeant Fowler arrived from  Mocha  with  one  of my boxes when this poor fellow notwithstanding my situation made me laugh aloud by producing a letter from his mother in Europe which made him extremely happy and which I must beg leave  verbatim  to transcribe  "Dair Shonny  "I have relaved your girl from the Bridevailand your shits from the panbrokerthe baby is diedblessed be Goat while I hop yow be living I am your laffing mother tell death  MAGGY FOWLER"  The same evening Colonel Seyburg's party returned without having obtained any further intelligence  On the th Colonel Fourgeoud was so dangerously  ill that he at length was obliged to relinquish his command and proceed to town for his recovery Accordingly on the th he set out by water for Paramaribo thus after having sacrificed all his troops he became himself finally a victim to his unbounded ambition and obstinate perseverance in this worst of all climates while by toiling less and living better both he and his soldiers might have rendered the colony if not superior at least an equal serviceA barge loaded with sick and dying was at the same time once more sent to the hospital at Devil's Harwar  The command of the remaining scarecrows now devolved upon the Lieutenant Colonel who strange to tell that very evening inherited the  same  distemper as well as the chief command the barge that rowed off the old hero having but just disappeared when this gentleman was attacked also by the phrenzy fever the above complaint was indeed at this time very common amongst all ranks and degrees who were broiling under a burning sun at Jerusalem it being the dry season when we ought to have been in the woodsbut for those expeditions as I have stated before the rainy seasons were most unhappily preferred Several officers would have before now thrown up their military commissions could they with decency have taken such a measure during an expedition on actual service nor in my opinion ought such to be granted cases of the very greatest necessity excepted I could myself have wished to go for some time to Paramaribo  but as this favour was not offered me while all the others and even the slaves were relieved I scorned to petition for it while I was able to stand  On the th however my foot became so bad that the surgeon reported me unfit for duty yet I still remained in the camp where I could be to none of any service  A supply of fresh troops slaves and provisions being arrived on the th Major Medlar with men was detached to make new discoveries  Among other plagues the whole camp at this time swarmed with  locusts  which appeared every where in most formidable troops devouring every thing that lay in their way Indeed the curse of Heaven seemed to visit us here in various shapes and every vermin were so plenty at this time that no exertion could keep us perfectly free These locusts were brown two inches in length and shaped like a grasshopper they did not fly but crawled by millions on the very tables and seats as we sat at dinner and at night they tormented us by crawling over our faces by scores  The only desirable article we found at Jerusalem was fish of which we seldom wanted plenty particularly  newmara  and  warrappa  also the  patakee  and the  old wifee  both very excellent the former of which is about two feet long shaped like a whiting the other is the size of a large perch A kind of needlefish called  naaynaayfisee  was found here in great abundance these were very thin and about one foot in length also a kind of  dungfish  about the size of a small herring but these two last were only used by the negroes  On the d of December Major Medlar's party returned after fourteen days absence with a captive rebel woman and her boy about eight years old taken in a small field of bitter cassava The poor woman was pregnant and under great alarms but was tenderly treated by Medlar who was always a humane and welldisposed gentleman He had however unluckily lost two of his best men one  Schoelar  a corporal the other called  Philip Van den Bos  a private marine who having inadvertently eaten a few roots of the above  bitter cassava  were poisoned and died during the same night with the most excruciating pain and convulsions the antidote is said to be Cayenne pepper and spirits neither of which were at that time to be procured  The black woman confirmed the account that Bonny had been wounded she also told us the poor starved negro we had found was called  Isaac  and had been left for dead That one Captain  Arico  had formed a new settlement near the sea called  FissyHollo  while Bonny she assured us maintained the strictest discipline amongst his troops he was she said absolutely despotic and had executed two of his men but three days before we took GadoSaby  viz  during the night of the th August when we heard the firing and shouting only upon suspicion of having hinted some few words in favour of the Europeans and were the heads which we found stuck  on the stakes She further assured us that none of his people were trusted with arms until they had first served him some years as slaves and given him unquestionable proofs of fidelity and resolution But these she observed were but few in number when compared to his numerous vassals who were bound to do without murmuring whatever he thought proper to command them yet that he  still  was more beloved than he was feared on account of his inflexible justice and manly courage  On the th December this poor woman and her boy were sent to Paramaribo with Ensign  de Cabaines  who had taken them he had at the same time nearly seized a young girl about fifteen who by her great agility and being stark naked slipped out of his hands  "Fugit ocior aurâ  "Illa levi neque ad haec revocantis verba resistit  "Nympha precor Peneia mane non insequor hostis  "Nympha mane"  OVID  It being proved at the court that the above woman had been forcibly carried off by the rebels though many years before the poor creature was pardoned and joyfully returned with her child to her master's plantation It is remarkable that when the boy saw the first cow or horse he almost fell into convulsions with terror nor could be bear to be touched by any white person whom  he never had seen before and whom he constantly called  Yorica  which in his language signifies the devil  About this time a dead seacow or  manatee  by the French called  Lamantin  floating past Jerusalem the negro slaves fell upon it like so many crows upon a carrion swimming round it some with a rusty knife some with a billhook and each carrying off a slice for his dinner at last they dragged the stinking animal on shore of which I instantly took a drawing This manatee was exactly sixteen feet long almost shapeless being an enormous lump of fat tapering backwards to a fleshy broad horizontal tail It had a thick round head a flattish snout large nostrils with von bristles both on its nose and chin small eyes and auditory holes instead of ears Instead of feet it had two excrescences or fleshy fins like those of the seaturtle projecting near its head with these it swims and moves awkwardly to eat the grass on the banks of the rivers being an amphibious animal The colour was a greenish black the skin was hard and uneven covered with large knobs circular wrinkles and with a very few stiff hairs thinly scattered It had grinders but no foreteeth and a very short tongue The seacow or manatee is like the whale a viviparous animal the female suckling its young by the help of its swimmers They are very numerous in the river Amazons their flesh it is said resembles veal and is very good food This was however too far advanced in a stare of putridity for me to taste it It had the marks of being  twice shot which must have been by the rebels on the th when we heard the report of two muskets at a distance  As I am once more on the subject of natural history I shall describe another amphibious animal called the  tapira  which bears some distant resemblance to the hippopotamus of the old continent but it is a great deal less This creature is about the size of a small ass but much more clumsy The head is not unlike that of a horse but the upper lip much longer projecting something like the proboscis of an elephant and is also moveable but too short to be of use as is the trunk of that animal the ears are short the tusks strong and sometimes visible the mane is bristly and erect the limbs are low and strong with a kind of hoof divided into four claws and the tail is thick and short like that of the elephant The skin of this creature is excessively thick of a brown colour and when young it is marked with white spots like those of the stag or paca proceeding in longitudinal rows It feeds on grass and other herbs that grow in watery places and is so shy that when alarmed by the smallest noise it plunges under water also like the paca for security where it remains for a considerable time The flesh of the tapira is delicate being accounted superior to the best oxbeefSee both the above animals in the annexed plate  A Mr  Selefelder  of the Society service at this time assured me that he saw quite a different riverhorse in the  The Tapin or Hippopotamus of South America  The Manati or Sea Cow of Guiana  River Marawina and Major  Abercromby  of the same service declared that a  mermaid  was lately seen in the River Surinam Lord  Monboddo  also positively affirms the existence of seawomen and seamen while he asserts that they were seen so late as But however respectable his lordship's judgment and authority may be on other subjects I can no more agree with him as to men and women having fins and scales than to their having  tails  The plain fact in my humble opinion is this that in many rivers between the Tropics both on the coast of Africa and South America a fish sometimes appears half above the water that bears a distant resemblance of the human species but is smaller nearly such as in was exhibited in London The colour is of a blackish green the head is round with a deformed kind of a face a strong fin runs from near the eyes to the middle of the back which something resembles flowing hair and the two supposed arms and hands are two fleshy fins or rather digitated swimmers the female has breasts assuredly like a woman's being a viviparous animal while the tail is exactly that of a fish in most of which properties it agrees with the seal but this last has no fin along the back and is considerably larger while it never appears erect above the water like the former The above information I had from several old negroes and Indians who all agreed perfectly in the description some added that they sang which I apprehend to be no other than a  grunting noise which they emit like most other tropical fish and amphibious animals  They concluded by assuring me that though they were scarce nothing was more dreaded by their wives and children than the  Watra Mama  which signifies the mother of the waters and by which name strange to tell they distinguish their  Sybils  So much for the  monsters  of the deep and now I shall once more return to those infesting Terra Firma  I have just mentioned that on account of a very bad foot I had been returned unfit for duty by the surgeon on the th of November yet this day December th another surgeon with two captains and the adjutant were sent to inspect both  me  and Captain  Perret  who was also sick The surgeon gave his declaration  upon oath  that we were incapable of walking without danger much more of undergoing fatigue but Seyburg who was still in his phrenzy fever declared we should instantly enter the woods though he should see us carried in two  wheelbarrows  Poor Captain Perret complied to turn out though he looked like a ghost and could scarcely stand but I solemnly swore that I would blow out the first man's brains who dared  disrespectfully  to touch me in consequence of which I was close guarded by a sentinel while the whole camp upon my soul now seemed to be composed of none but madmen  On the th we received intelligence that a number of armed rebels had been just seen opposite to Devil's Harwar  and afterwards informed they were upon their retreat from the Comawina River where on the th they had burnt to ashes the dwellinghouse of the estate  Killestyn Nova  with Mr  Slighter  the overseer  in it  ransacked the whole plantation killed and carried off thirtythree women and chopped off the limb of a male mulatto child to be revenged of its father and that the Pirica rangers were in pursuit of them Captain Fredericy also arrived this day who had exchanged from the Society troops into Colonel Fourgeoud's regiment of marines and confirmed to us the above unhappy news  About this time after having starved four months my remaining stores arrived at last from Mocha but threefourths rotted and destroyed by the  blata  or cockroaches the remaining part I distributed among the sick people But what proved truly acceptable was the cheering account that  Joanna  and  Johnny  were past danger and recovering at Paramaribo This intelligence indeed so elevated my spirits that the next morning I reported myself fit for duty though God knows that I was not and to this I was the more induced by the want of fresh air of which I was perfectly debarred in my confinement and stood so much in need The same evening a boat full of Caribbee Indians rowed up Cormoetibo for the River Marawina by the communication of the Wana Creek  In eight days more which was the th of December being actually recovered of the wound in my foot and Seyburg of his phrenetic fever another officer and I played him the following trick for his bad usage  Having invited this gentleman with his adjutant and a few more to see us act a farce by candlelight we affected to quarrel and beating out the candle the door being well secured laid on in the dark with such success upon a certain somebody's shoulders that calling out Murder he leaped out at the window Nothing ever gave me greater entertainment than to perceive his agility but Colonel Seyburg declared he would never more to  our play  be a spectator  At this time orders arrived from Colonel Fourgeoud who was also better to break up our camp at Jerusalem and march once more to the Wana Creek In consequence the sick were again sent down in barges to the hospital at Devil's Harwar which was nearly full while several were labouring under a disease something like the  tympany  called here the  kook  being a prodigious hardness and swelling in the belly occasioned it is said by drinking muddy water without spirits which was indeed our daily and general beverage  On the d at six o'clock in the morning we all decamped and scrambled up along the banks of the Cormoetibo Creek through a perfect bog while one poor negro who had his head fractured was left behind and another knocked overboard one of the barges who was drowned  We this day again saw great numbers of pingoes or warreehogs which as usual breaking through our line were cut down by sabres and stabbed while some ran off with the bayonets sticking in their hams  This march was peculiarly disagreeable upon account of the heavy rains which now began to fall down in torrents overflowing the banks of all the rivers and so cold were the damps in the morning contrasted with the late warm days that we frequently lay shivering in our hammocks as in frost especially when sleeping in wet cloaths This inconvenience however I obviated to day by marching half naked like the rangers and putting my shirt in one of the reversed kettles during the rain thus my skin soon drying after a shower I again put on my linen and found myself much more comfortable than any of my trembling ghastly looking companions  On the evening of the d we encamped near a rivulet called the  Caymans  or Alligator Creek where a tree called  Monbiara  afforded some excellent fruit but this was entirely stripped by the slaves before I could either taste or even see it in perfection  The rains continuing to pour down in a deluge I again marched stripped on the th and we slung our hammocks in the evening near a brook called  Yorica  or the Devil's Creek where we made huts or sheds to cover us and stowed the provisions upon rafters  On the following day we once more laboured through deep mud and water in very heavy rains and encamped at another small brook called the  Java Creek  three miles below the Wana  On the th I was selected with a small party to reconnoitre the old camps at Wana Creek In the evening  we returned half swimming through mud and water and having literally seen nothing except some birds and curious trees which I cannot pass unnoticed The birds were called the  Cromback  the  Camawarry  and the  Crocro  The first is a kind of large snipe the size of a woodcock with a crooked bill The second is also a water fowl but three times as large as the first on account of their swiftness and disappearing in a moment I can give but a very imperfect description of them The  Crocro  is something less than our ravens and I believe of the same species being one of the most voracious birds of the carnivorous tribe in Guiana it is of a dark blue colour has a remarkably strong bill and limbs and croaks excessively loud and disagreeably especially by night The trees were what the negroes called the  Matakee  and the  Markoory  The first is remarkable for its roots which spread above the ground in such a manner that they will conceal a score of men from each other nay so large are they sometimes that a horseman may ride through between the interstices and one single piece is sufficient to make a table large enough to hold twelve people  For a better idea of this wonderful tree I refer the reader to the annexed plate where I have placed it upon the opposite shore of the encampment at Jerusalem In the same plate he is also presented with a  fairweather  view of the camp at Java Creek  The other tree called the Markoory is truly formidable  View of the Camp at the Java Creek  View of the Encampment at Jerusalem  on account of its poisonous qualities which are of such a subtle nature that the very smoke of this wood when on fire is fatal to those animals that receive it into their lungs this is always seen to grow by itself as it infallibly kills every thing around it nay even the slaves refuse to cut it down on the plantations so much are they afraid of touching or of even coming near to it The Markoory is low ugly and uneven with very few branches and a pale verdure I have been told that some of the Indians render their arrows fatal by dipping the barbs of them in its sap  On the th another patrole was sent out but to no better purpose than the first I have mentioned that my foot was recovered and so it was but I had now extracted out of my right arm two dreadful insects which left behind them very deep ulcers These are called in Surinam the  bushworms  and are the shape and size of the aurelia of the common butterfly with a pointed tail and black head They stuck extremely fast in the flesh and were extracted with a lancet They breed naturally in stagnated waters in marching constantly through which they had attached themselves to my flesh  My heart now began to sink with accumulated disasters my mind was agitated and depressed with a constant train of tortures to which I could see no end and I became weary of life In this dreadful situation I fell upon my naked knees and invoked the malediction of Heaven to fall on me if I did not separate myself from  my present commanders and this service the first honourable opportunity that should offer itselfhow religiously I have persevered in observing this vow shall be seen in the sequel of these pages before I take my final farewell of my readers  The place of our present encampment was now intolerable beyond every description being constantly overflowed so that the ammunition and provisions were stowed for preservation on wooden rafts nor could we step out of our hammocks without being up to the knees in mud and water where it was most shallow while the gnats and other insects devoured us alive The consequence of all which was that  another  barge full of dying wretches was sent down the Cormoetibo Creek bound for the hospital at Devil's Harwar among whom the poor old negro with his fractured skull who had only yesterday rejoined us in his shocking condition This floating  charnelhouse  weighed anchor on the last day of the year with which I shall beg leave to conclude this gloomy chapter  CHAP XXIV Two Volunteer Companies raised of free Mulattoes and NegroesDescription of the Arrowouka Indian Nation Colonel Fourgeoud's Regiment receives orders to sail for EuropeCountermandedReenter the WoodsTrade of the ColonyDescription of a Cacao EstateSample of Sable Heroism  TO what good star I was obliged  CHAP XXIV  in the midst of all our confusion and distress I know not but certain it is that Colonel Seyburg having sent for me on the first day of the new year not only solicited my future friendship but declared he was sorry for all the illtreatment he had ever occasioned me for which he principally blamed Mr  Gibhart  his adjutant and spy then taking me by the hand as a proof of his real regard permitted me from that moment to go to Paramaribo or wherever I pleased to refresh and refit until further orders which had such an effect on me that having instantly converted every drop of my rum into grog we sat down together with two other officers and drowned all former animosity in oblivion till we could hardly see each other In this condition I took my leave that very evening of my  new  friend and the camp at Java Creek and rowed down in the best spirits for Paramaribo  Next morning having slept during most of the passage I breakfasted at Devil's Harwar where I found that the unfortunate Gibhart had just set sail for the  other  world In the evening we arrived at the estate Beekslied as my negroes had made extraordinary dispatch  fumming wattra  That is one of the rowers beating the water with his oar at every stroke in such a manner that it sounds different from the rest to which the others sing a chorus  all the time to encourage each other  On the d I arrived at the fortress Amsterdam where I was entertained with an excellent fish dinner and where I must again intreat the reader's patience while I attempt to describe the different species  viz  the  passary prareprare provost  and  curema  The passary is above two feet long and weighs sometimes twenty pounds the head is broad and flat it has two long barbs and no scales and is very delicate eating The prareprare is about the same size and equally good The provost is large often five feet and of a yellowish colour the flesh of this is less agreeable but the oil it produces comes to good account As for the curema this is a species of mullet sometimes above two feet in length with large silvery eyes and the under jaw longer than the upper Near this place are also found a kind of  seasnails  of which Madam Merian makes mention and the forepart of which exactly resembles those of a shrimp  In the evening at six o'clock I arrived once more at Paramaribo and found Joanna with her little boy perfectly  well after having both been blind for above three weeks with whom being now invited to lodge at the house of my friend Mr De Graaf I was completely happy  The following day I dined with Colonel Fourgeoud who now also was as sound as ever and who gave me a very indifferent meal of salt provisions  This he absolutely held as the best regimen for health notwithstanding he had brought three cooks from Europe  but an  uncommonly  hearty welcome He acquainted me that two new companies of free mulattoes and two of free negroes all volunteers had just been raised that the Serameca and Owca negroes encouraged and favoured the rebels and were deceitful rascals that a few rebels had been killed in the Cassiwinica Creek and that he was in hopes of rooting out  Fissy Hollo  that  Bonny  with his people were almost starving in the forest notwithstanding their late depredations which could not last much longer and that he was fully determined if he should lose his last man to make  this  rebel surrender or harass him till he and his gang through hunger and distress should be obliged to quit the colony I learned further from him that a Frenchman had just escaped hanging for betraying the state of the fortifications c to the governor of Cayenne that he had pardoned Captain Tulling for his clandestine marriage and that Lieutenant Colonel de Borgnes was just entered into matrimony with a rich widow a Mrs Crawford  The Colonel in a word was now quite the reverse of what he had been before and upon the whole so very agreeable in his manners that I would never wish to spend my time in better company but how I should become at once the favourite of both these rival commanders was a secret I could never yet discover unless it might proceed from a desire of gaining me from each other as they still continued mutual enemies be that as it may I resolved to preserve the most inflexible neutrality as I also did between them and the governor where I was invited next day and dined not on saltbeef but found as usual a truly magnificent entertainment  Thus I continued daily visiting my friends  viz  Mrs Godefroy the Demellys the Gordons the Mac Neyls c I also spent a very agreeable day with the black Mrs Sampson or Zubly who was now a widow  I was present too at a mulatto ball composed however not of slaves but of free independant settlers Here the music the lights the country dances the supper and above all the dresses were so superb and their behaviour so decent and genteel that the whole might serve as a model for decorum and etiquette to some of the fairer and more polished inhabitants  On the th observing a number of Indians and black people of both sexes swimming at the back of Fort Zelandia young Donald Mac Neyl and myself compleated the groupe by stripping and getting in among them and I must confess I never beheld more surprising feats  of activity in the water than were performed by the negroes who fought a  sham battle  by plunging or rather tumbling like porpoises when they struck each other with their legs as they never used their hands while the Indians who were of the  Arrowouka  nation swam and dived like amphibious animals  Being sufficiently refreshed we sat down upon the beach near the twentyone gun battery where I had an opportunity of examining the features and figure of one of their young females as she approached us like Venus rising out of the sea These people being very different from all the other Indian nations that I have already described I shall embrace the opportunity of fulfilling my promise and giving a particular account of themIn the first place the skin of the young woman who was now emerging clean from the river and divested of arnottapaint appeared much fairer than the coppercolour of the other Indians neither were her limbs deformed by those straitlaced bracelets or cottonbands so much in use with the rest nor did her hair hang down but was neatly plaited close round the crown of her head and fastened in the centre with a broad silver plate  This at other times they supply by a shell a fishbone or the tooth of a tiger c  Her only dress consisted both during the time she bathed and after of a small square apron made of beads as I have mentioned before in every other respect she was perfectly naked nor could a finer figure be imagined  erect vigorous active young and healthy which convinced me that when the body is exposed as it certainly was ordained by nature the face is but little noticed  " Such as Arcadian song  "Transmits from ancient uncorrupted Time  "When tyrant Custom had not shackled Man  "But free to follow  Nature  was the mode"  In her features was displayed that beautiful simplicity that native unsuspecting innocence which cannot be put on where there is the slightest consciousness of guilt Nor is the olivecolour incompatible with beauty it is certainly the standard complexion of the human race while the black and white are supposed to be only gradations produced probably by the extremes of heat and cold As this Indian girl was perfectly handsome so she seemed to be perfectly happy  "Happiness" as the Abbe Reynal wisely observes "is more frequently found in a pure state of nature than in that of the most refined civilization"  To be sure an European woman would blush to her fingers ends at the very idea of appearing publicly stark naked but education and prejudice are every thing since it is an axiom that where there is no feeling of selfreproach there can assuredly be no shame  I remember to have seen an Indian youth whose name was  Weekee  at BergenopZoom where he was brought over from the colony Berbicè with General  Desalve  who cloathed and partly civilized him amongst other things  Indian Female of the Arrowauka Nation  he learned cookery and to be something of a taylor at his own request that he might be enabled to provide both for his back and his belly After some time however expressing a desire to return to the colony he no sooner touched American ground than stripping himself of his lumber he launched naked into his native woods where he ended his days as he had begun them amongst his beloved countrymen and companions like the Hottentot mentioned by Rousseau in his celebrated  Discours sur l'Inegalité Conditions c  But to return to the girlShe had with her a live parrot which she had stunned with a blunt arrow from her bow and for which I gave her a doublebladed knife  The general traffick carried on between all the Indian nations and the Europeans consists in balsamcapivi arrococerra oil of carrabba arnotta and beeswax besides pieces of Brazil and ebony the roots hiaree and varnillas canoes hammocks slaves monkies parrots and paroquets for which they receive firearms knives hatchets fishhooks combs coral and glass beads blue cotton lookingglasses c  So wonderfully expert are the Arrowouka Indians at this exercise that they frequently bring down a macaw in full flight or even a pigeon  I cannot conclude these remarks without adding a few words concerning the unspotted moral character of these people who not only live in peace with most of the other Indian nations but are peculiarly attached to the Europeans while these in return profess for them the strongest esteem  As a proof of their gratitude I will only relate one instance Some years ago an Indian woman being at Paramaribo and far advanced in a state of pregnancy a Mr  Van der Mey  humanely ordered his servants to conduct her and her husband into his house where giving them a private apartment and every other conveniency he wished them goodnight Before the next morning the woman was delivered but when the servants went in to renew their offers of friendship neither man wife nor child were to be found as they had before daybreak quietly marched into the forest  I have mentioned before that the Indians are exempt from pain in labour  Various were at this time the conjectures concerning the boasted  integrity  of the  Arrowouka  Indians until no less than eighteen months after the same Indian returned to Mr Van der Mey with a charming captive boy of the  Accawau  nation that he had taken in battle  This is however extremely uncommon as a more peaceable people does not exist in the universe  and whom presenting to his benefactor he only said "  That's yours  " and without waiting for any answer disappearedFor this slave the above gentleman was offered £ which he refused and treated him as well as if he had been free  The education these people receive in their infancy being according to the dictates only of simple nature their minds or their bodies are very seldom deformed while a too nice attention to either is possibly as detrimental as a total neglect The ingenious Dr Bancroft is  of the same opinion which he supports I think needlessly by a quotation from Quintilian  Though the Arrowouka Indians live in perfect friendship and harmony with us and indeed with most of their neighbours they yet sometimes go to war when provoked as I have just observed in these combats they use bows and arrows and the club called  abowtow  The New Zealanders call their clubs  patapatoo  which affinity is remarkable on account of their very great distance  but they do not eat their prisoners like the Caribbee Indians who even devoured the negroes whom they killed at the insurrection in Berbicè Notwithstanding these people live at a greater distance from the sea than the  Warrows  c yet they have canoes sometimes fourscore feet in length in which they paddle down the rivers The Arrowouka Indians particularly are great herbalists and for all external accidents have recourse to simples with which the woods of all Terra Firma abound But to proceed  On the th I was seized with a fever and blooded in the foot in which the orifice being  struck  too deep for struck if was as they bleed the horses I again became lame daring which time Colonel Seyburg arrived from the Java Creek to recover he being at last also taken very ill  In the mean time Colonel Fourgeoud while he was just ready to renew his operations having already sent a small detachment to the Jew Savannah for intelligence received letters from the Hague with express orders to  abandon the expedition immediately and with his few remaining troops to sail for Holland without delay  In consequence of these commands on the th the transport ships were put in commission and all the officers and privates received their clearance which made them very happy and indeed all at Paramaribo were alive with joy except some of the inhabitants and myself  On the th of February ill as I was with a bad foot a sore arm the prickly heat and all my teeth loose with the scurvy I found means to scramble out on crutches with a thousand florins in my pocket which having divided between Fourgeoud and Mrs Godefroy for the redemption of the black boy  Quaco  and my  mulatto  I returned borne without a shilling in my purse yet for this small sum of florins so inadequate to which I owed that lady she was induced generously to renew her persuasions of carrying Joanna and the boy with me to Holland This however Joanna as nobly as firmly refused declaring  "that independant of all other considerations she could never think of sacrificing one benefactor to the interest of another and that her own happiness or even mine which was dearer to her than life should never have any weight till the debt of her liberty was paid by me or by her own industry to the utmost fraction and which she did not despair to see one day compleated"  She added  "our separation should only be for a time and that the greatest proof I could ever shew her of my real esteem was now to undergo this little trial of fortune like a man without  so much as heaving a sigh in her presence"  which last she spoke with a smile next embraced her infant then turned suddenly round and wept most bitterlyAt this moment I was called to Mr  de la Mare  's who was just dead where my melancholy having surpassed all description I at last determined to weather one or two painful years in her absence and in the afternoon went to dissipate my mind at a Mr  Roux  's cabinet of Indian curiosities where as my eye chanced to fall on a rattlesnake I will before I leave the colony describe this dangerous reptile  The  rattlesnake  of Surinam is sometimes eight or nine feet long and very thick about the middle tapering towards the neck and tail The head is dreadfully deformed being flat and broad with two large nostrils near the snout and a large scale or knob like the alligator above his eyes which are jetblack and sparkling at the extremity of the tail are several thin horny shells joined together which are very dry and which when irritated the animal shakes sounding much like a  rattle  from which it derives its name These shells augment  it is said  in the proportion of one every year by which it is supposed its age may be ascertained This whole snake is covered over with scales which on the ridge of the back it crects The colour is a dirty orange mixed with darkbrown and black spots which last are also on its head appearing like velvet and marked in a very conspicuous manner the belly is ashcoloured with transverse  scales like most other serpents When this animal is intent on mischief it lies coiled like a rope with the tail a little in motion which having rattled it launches forth upon its prey making no farther reach than its own length this done it coils a second time and again projects itself The bite of the rattlesnake is accounted fatal at least is thought very dangerous over all America but with regard to the fascinating qualities of its eyes such as the story of its causing mice squirrels and birds to run into its mouth I reject them as fables the supposed charm consisting in nothing more than this that the poor animals finding themselves surprized by the impending danger are seized with such a trepidation and fear that even the use of their limbs forsakes them and they are rivetted to the place till they die or in the act of leaping they are seized by their enemy  See a letter to the editors of the New Universal Magazine for October    In this cabinet I also saw the  blue dipsas  of Surinam which had almost the colour of ultramarine on the back its sides were lighter and the belly nearly white I did not learn that the bite of this reptile was fatal but that it occasions immoderate thirst in the patient from which it took its name the word  dipsa  signifying thirst in the Greek language Another snake I also observed here about three feet long being annulated with different colours and called  amphisboena  from the supposition of its having two heads but the truth is that from its cylindrical  The Green Butterfly of South America  The Rattle Snake Dypsas of Guiana  form the head and tail so much resemble each other that the error is almost pardonable besides which the eyes are nearly imperceptible This is the snake which being supposed blind and vulgarly said to be fed by the large ants already described is in this country honoured with the name of King of the Emmets  How Madam Merian should call this reptile an  oviparous viper  surpasses my comprehension    Amongst Mr Roux's numerous collection of fine butterflies one of a middle size I thought peculiarly beautiful all its wings both above and below being elegantly streaked with transverse bars of velvet black and a variegated bright green The amazing height to which they ascend and the great velocity with which these insects fly make them so rare being for these reasons but very seldom caught The caterpillar is a seagreen and all covered over with hard feelers not unlike feathersFor a better idea of the above snakes and this fly see the plate annexed where the last was improved from Madam Merian's collection  I have just said that we were ordered to leave the colony and that all were overjoyed with the news myself excepted But on the th by letters from Holland to our chief our  return  was again countermanded for six months My companions were therefore suddenly cast down with disappointment while I was as suddenly revived and now determined to save all my pay until Joanna's redemption should be fully accomplished but what  grieved me very much was the other news from Europe  viz  that the  Scots Brigade  had been invited to England by his Britannic Majesty while I was lamenting that I could not possibly be one of the number  The King's demand was negatived by the States of Holland  I at the same time had the offer of an American company under General Washington but this I refused without any hesitation as may be supposed  In short on the th of February the poor dispirited men were again sent up to Magdenburg a large party still remaining at the Java Creek whilst the temper of the officers was now so ruffled that a Mr  Fisher  of our corps fought no less than  two  duels in two succeeding days dangerously wounding both his antagonists who were both officers of the Society regiment  As I was not yet recovered I staid some time longer at Paramaribo where at the house of a Mr Reynsdorp I saw a Portuguese  Jew  teaching his children the  Christian  religion while the pious mother of the charityhouse kept flogging the poor slaves daily because they were as she said unbelievers To one black woman in particular she wantonly gave four hundred lashes who bore them without a complaint  But to change the disagreeable subjectwhile I have the leisure and the opportunity I feel the inclination to state to the public a short account of the trade and intrinsic value of this bloodspilling colony which still  might be richer did they not follow the example of the woman in the fable with her golden eggs  In the first place in Surinam are computed to be about six or eight hundred plantations producing sugar coffee cacao and cotton besides some indigo and valuable timbers cThe exportation of which four first articles only and their value may be seen at one view in the following table for four successive years  The Years  Barrels of SUGAR  lbs of COFFEE  lbs of CACAO  lbs of COTTON                                          Total          barrels of sugar at florins  per  barrel make  f          lbs of coffee at ½  d per  lb make         lbs of cacao at ½  d per  lb make        lbs of cotton at  d per  lb make         Sum total  f        Which makes in one year exactly  f        But this average produce was shipped off for the town of Amsterdam only           Carried forward  f        Brought forward  f        If I now add what goes to Rotterdam and to Zealand besides the home consumption and the return of the rum and molasses the indigo at  f per  lb and the timber from  d  to five florins  per  cubic foot it will amount to as much more        Thus altogether  f        Which supposing it was but  f  makes a yearly income of  one million  neat in sterling money  How the above sum is divided between the republic of Holland and this colony shall be my business to state in the second place  The town of Amsterdam affords about fifty ships at an average of tons burthen each which receive for importation freight of various commodities the sum of  f             For exportation freight of the above productions which grow in the colony  Sugar pays about  l per  barrel and coffee about as much  per  thousand other commodities in proportion  N B  This I insert unauthenticated thus errors excepted             Thus each vessel gets for freight  f             Which multiplied by the N  o  of vessels           Makes exactly  f          For Rotterdam and Zealand I calculate together about vessels more of different burdens thus          Carried forward  f          Brought forward  f          And for the brick that serves for ballast passengers c          Each Guinea ship importing yearly from to negroes lowest value at  f             Thus supposing the number of vessels  There are some years but four and some ten c             Amounts to          To all these I shall add the merchandize imported from Holland such as wine spirits beer saltbeef pork and flour silk cotton and linenmanufactures cloaths hats shoes gold silver and steel ornaments arms and ammunition even masons and carpenters tools c c at an average of about  per cent  profit Besides correspondents charges insurance duty storehouse expences porters fees wharfage and package which last articles cost the inhabitants ten  per cent  more           Thus altogether          Which makes already the sum of  f          Still let me mention the interest of  per cent  for the national debt of five millions sterling due by the colony and what they are defrauded of by usurers in Holland where prodigious other charges are brought in and where those who have made their fortunes go to spend it and the amount will be found to produce at least          The whole of which items added together produce no less a sum yearly than  f          Brought forward  f          Which is clear profit to the republic  viz  principally for Amsterdam Rotterdam and Zealand Thus the inhabitants of Surinam get for their share of the above treasure only          Which make together as I said one million sterling or  f          In the third place I shall now show in what manner the internal expence of the society of Surinam is defrayed by taxes which amount to no trifle as shall be seen  Having already mentioned when speaking of the government that the public revenue officers were five in number I will now point out how they collect the cash respectively each for the support of the above expences  The first of these is that of Importation and Exportation Duties  To this is paid  viz  By all Dutch vessels  f per  ton  thus for tonnage  f             By Americans c  f per  ton           By Americans c for all imports and exports  per cent                   Sugar pays  f per  thousand or barrel  in paid           Coffee  d per  lb weight           Cacao  f    d per  lb D  o              Cotton     f          Thus receives yearly about the sum of  f          Brought forward           f          The second is the office of excise and small duties           To this is paid  viz                    For a barrel of beer  f                   A D  o  of claret                   A pipe of madeira                  All wines  per  quart bottle                   The tax on publicans is                   D  o  on small retailers                   And which amounts to a yearly produce of at least          Then follows thirdly the office for taxation on heads which receives for all inhabitants black and white without exception  viz           For men and women  f      this produces yearly           For boys and girls under  f              Next comes the office for sales and slaves which gets  viz           For selling dead stock including estates c  per cent  thus  For selling newlyarrived or imported negro slaves ½  per cent  thus          And finally the office for retaking negro deserters which was then erected the other taxes not being sufficient which produces yearly  viz           By an additional tax on heads black and white at  f  is           By  per cent  of every profit got during the year upon oath is           Which makes exactly                   Carried forward           f          Brought forward           f          Still let me not forget what is yearly paid for what is called the support of the common or grass fields  viz           For a house according to its size                    For a coach                   For a whiskey                   For a saddlehorse                   Which add to the above impositions again          And these if summed together make a yearly revenue of no less than  f          Having now clearly demonstrated partly by the assistance of Dr Fermyn's  Tableau de la Colonie de Surinam  and partly by my own experience that the intrinsic value of this settlement is worth yearly above  one million  of sterling money which by proper management might be still increased also that the greater part of it goes to the republic while the people are thus burthened on their estates by almost insupportable taxation which induces many to be rogues who would perhaps otherwise be honest I shall by way of appendix give some short account of the trade carried on in this colony by the  North Americans  These people arrive with small brigs sloops and schooners from Virginia Rhode Island New York Boston Jamaica Grenada Antigua Barbadoes c from which places they export flour beef pork herrings salt mackarel and leaftobacco for the negroes also firboards English rum and other spirits loafsugar  I have said they can make no rum here neither do they refine sugar  spermaceticandles onions c Besides each vessel is bound to bring in one horse  Mr Hartzink mentions four horses but this is a mistake  which they often supply by a head only affirming that they put on board a horse but that he died on the passage For the above commodities the American traders export all the melasses of this colony to distil into rum at home and frequently shiploads of other productions and merchandize though this is done in a clandestine manner by which both the seller and buyer are considerable gainers being ready cash for the one and a cheap bargain for the other From the Leeward Islands these vessels also import private mulatto and quaderoon slaves which being generally young and handsome whatever may be their moral character sell for considerable prices  Having thus shewn according to the best information I was able to acquire in what the commerce and intrinsic wealth of this fine colony consist I will now take my leave of the subject and continue my narrative  On the st of February Mr  Reynsdorp  the soninlaw of Mrs Godefroy took me in his sail barge for change of air to  NutenSchadelyk  one of his own coffee estates where I saw a white man who had lately lost both his eyes in one night by the bats or vampires as they are called and the following day sailing up Comewina River we proceeded to the delightful  Cacao  plantation  Alkmaar  the property of the above lady where the negro slaves are treated like children by the mistress to whom they all look up as to their common parent Here were no groans to be heard no fetters to be met with nor any marks of severity to be seenbut all was harmony and content The superb house and other offices of this charming estate where pleasure and hospitality ever reign I have already represented in plate N  o  X while the fields and gardens nay even the negro houses bore all the marks of perfect peace and plenty  The  cacaotrees  are supplied from nurseries for the purpose like orchards in England and planted very regularly at ten or twelve feet distance from each other where they grow to the height of our English cherrytrees But these plantations must be well sheltered both from the hard winds and scorching sun when young the roots not entering deep into the ground to succour them nor can they at that time bear extraordinary heat on which account the groves are filled up with cassavashrubs or plantaintrees for their shelter and which at the same time answer the purpose of killing the weeds which grow so luxuriantly in all the tropical climates by these attentions the trees will bear fruit before they are three years old when they afford two crops annually but they are in the highest perfection at the age of twelve or fourteen The leaf of the cacaotree is above eight inches long and nearly three broad thickpointed ribbed like the laureltime and of a bright greencolour  The fruit is about the same size and when young resembles a cucumber but when ripe it becomes yellow like a large lemon with ribs like the melon and tubercles which enclose the feed or nuts near thirty in number they lie longitudinally in the fruit and when fit for use are of the size of olives and purplecoloured The trees are supposed to bear at each crop from thirty to three hundred pods each containing about thirty nuts weighing one pound from which a calculation may be made how much will be the produce of each harvest After a few days the nuts are extracted from the pods and dried in the shade during which time they undergo a very strong perspiration when they are put into barrels and fit for transportation to be converted into that wellknown and agreeable beverage called Chocolate  It is said the cacaotrees are natives of Guiana and grow wild in large quantities near the river Amazon be that as it may Governor  Chatillon  's son planted the first tree in Surinam in and the first crop was exported to Holland in A great advantage in cultivating cacaotrees is that fewer slaves are required than in any other branch of the planting business How considerable are the profits will appear by the accounts of the year when lbs were exported to Amsterdam alone which produced  f  Dutch money being equal to £ sterling The prices have been fluctuating from  d  to  d per  lb the average being  about ½  d  The best estates of which  Alkmaar  is one produce yearly above lbs weight  In the plate annexed  A  is the leaf above  B  below  Drs Bancroft and Brooke say the leaf is light above and dark below which in my original drawing is quite the reverse    C  the wood  D  the flower  E  the young pulp  F  the same in perfection and  G  the seeds or nuts to make the chocolate  On the th we returned to town where the day before a Society soldier was shot for mutiny and the day following a ship was burnt in the roads At this time the celebrated free negro Qwasi who was the prophet priest and king of the rangers c went to Holland on a visit to the Prince of Orange with letters of recommendation from Fourgeoud whose praises he was to resound as well as to complain of the Governor for not treating him with due respect This being the period for the sessions another negro's leg was cut off for sculking from a task to which he was unequal while two more were condemned to be hanged for running away altogether The heroic behaviour of one of these men before the court deserves particularly to be noticedHe begged only to be heard for a few moments which being granted he proceeded thus  "I was born in Africa where defending my prince during an engagement I was made a captive and sold for a slave on the coast of Guinea by  my own  countrymen  Sprig of the Cacao or Chocolate Tree  One of your countrymen who is now to be one of my judges became my purchaser in whose service I was treated so cruelly by his  overseer  that I deserted and joined the rebels in the woodsHere again I was condemned to be a slave to  Bonny  their chief who treated me with even more severity than I had experienced from the Europeans till I was once more forced to elope determined to shun mankind for ever and inoffensively to end my days by myself in the forest Two years had I persevered in this manner quite alone undergoing the greatest hardships and anxiety of mind preserving life only for the possibility of once more seeing my dear family who were perhaps starving on my account in my own country I say two miserable years had just elapsed when I was discovered by the rangers taken and brought before this tribunal who are now acquainted with the history of my wretched life and from whom the only favour I have to ask is that I may be executed  next Saturday  or as soon as it may possibly be convenient"  This speech was uttered with the utmost moderation by one of the finestlooking negroes that was perhaps ever seen to which his former master who as he observed was now one of the judges made the following laconic reply  "Rascal that is not what we want to know but the  torture  this moment shall make you confess crimes as black as yourself as well as those of your hateful accomplices"  To which the negro who  now swelled in every vein with indignation and ineffable contempt  "Massera the tigers have trembled for these hands"  holding them up  "and dare you think to threaten me with your wretched instrument No I despise the utmost tortures you can now invent as much as I do the pitiful wretch who is going to inflict them"  Saying which he threw himself down on the rack where amidst the most excruciating torments he remained with a smile without uttering a syllable nor did he ever speak again until he ended his unhappy days at the gallows  What good man can "reflect the tearstain'd eye  "When blood attests even slaves for freedom die  "On cruel gibbets high disclos'd they rest  "And scarce one groan escapes one bloated breast  "Here sable  Caesars  The above names with such as  Nero Pluto Charon Cerberus Proserpine Medusa  c are usually given to negro slaves in exchange for  Quacoo Quacy Quamy Quamina Quasiba Adjuba  c  feel the Christian rod  "There Afric  Platos  tortur'd hope a God  "While jetty  Brutus  for his country sighs  "And sooty  Cato  with his freedom dies"  Having dined with Colonel Fourgeoud on the th of March when we celebrated the Prince of Orange's birthday while Mr Reyndorp gave a treat to all the soldiers he acquainted me that the rangers were now alone encamped at the Wana Creek that the pestilential spot  Devil's Harwar  was at last entirely forsaken and that the two lately  raised companies of sable volunteers had taken a few prisoners and killed others on the  Wanica path  behind Paramaribo I was at this time a good deal better but still not being quite recovered he who had formerly treated me so severely now even insisted on my staying some longer time at Paramaribo nay gave me an offer to return to Europe which I absolutely refused in short about the middle of the month I was as well as ever I was in my life At this time Colonel Fourgeoud and myself were daily visitors of the ladies in whose company no man could behave better while I could often not avoid disgust indeed so languid were many in their looks and so unrestrained were some in their conversation that a Mrs  N  even asked me  sans ceremonie  to supply the place of her husband while she might as well have asked me to drink for a relish a tumbler of salts  On the th however my eyes were better feasted when going to dine with Colonel Texier of the Society troops I first took a walk in the orange grove and the governor's gardens here peeping through the foliage I soon discovered two most elegant female figures after bathing the one a fine young  Samboo  the other a  blooming Quaderoon  which last was so very fair complexioned that she might have passed for a native of Greece while the roses that glowed in her cheek were equal to those that blossomed in the shrubbery  It is to be remarked that though Europeans look pale under the torrid zone the native inhabitants have often a freshness peculiarly engaging particularly mulattoes and quaderoons  They were walking  hand in hand and conversing with smiles near a flowery bank that adorned the side of a crystal brook in which they plunged the instant they heard me rustling amongst the verdure like two  mermaids  "Then to the flood they rush'd the parted flood  "Its lovely guests with closing waves receiv'd  "And every beauty soft'ning every grace  "Flushing anew a mellow lustre shed  Leaving them to enjoy their innocent amusement of bathing I spent the remaining hour before dinner amongst the shady fruittrees blooming bowers and serpentine gravel walks where indeed I saw greater variety of European plants than I imagined were produced in a tropical climate such as mint fennel sage rosemary goldenrod and jessamine the sensitive plant pomegranates roses figs and even some grapesOf the pomegranate flowers a specimen may be seen in plate N  o  XXIX The sigs are both within and without of a beautiful crimson colour but the roses are rather pale Here were some beautiful pineapples and melons which though they are so generally known I will nevertheless give some account of The imperial fruit called  Anana  or pineapple grows in the centre of an elegant seagreen plant on a stalk of the same hue about eight inches in length its leaves diverging near the surface of the earth which are smooth long strong pointed and dentulated with hard prickles The shape of this fruit is nearly oval the size of a sugarloaf all over chequered and of  a most beautiful orange or golden colour being crowned with a seagreen tuft of the same leaves as the mother plant and which when put in the ground produces another pineapple in the space of about eighteen months The delicious taste and flavour of this fruit has in the space of half a century become so well known that I have introduced it merely to notice its  plenty  in the country I write of for so spontaneously indeed do the former grow in this climate and of such different kinds without any cultivation that on many estates they serve as a common food for hogs  The  musk  and  water melons  grow also plentifully in this country the first is of a globular form large like the crown of a small hat ribbed buff colour orange and green The pulp is yellow firm sweet and succulent still it is eaten with sugar but more frequently with black pepper and saltthe smell of this fruit is excellent  The watermelon is of an oval or cylindrical shape its colour is a bright polished green and partly a very pale buff the pulp of this fruit is a pink colour and of a mellow watery substance its taste is sweet exceedingly cooling and of a most agreeable flavour  Both the above melons are of the cucumber kind growing on rough stalks with large leaves that creep along the ground It is remarkable that the watermelon which may be freely eaten in all distempers without the least pernicious consequence thrives best in very dry and sandy  placesIn the annexed plate may be seen the  Anana  or pineapple with the musk and watermelon besides the seed from which this last is produced  I sent about this period to a Mr Reygersman in Holland a most elegant collection of Surinam  butterflies  which are here caught in great abundance and variety and by which alone some people make no small profit but the very idea of pinning them alive to a sheet of paper was sufficient to prevent me from becoming a flycatcher  "Lo the poor beetle that we tread upon  "Feels a like pang as when a giant falls"  Now Captains Van Geurick and Fredericy with Serjeant Fowler were sent on an embassy to the  Owca  and  Sarameca  free negroes if possible to procure their assistance against the rebels which they always continued to  promise  while Colonel Fourgeoud gave them presents but never yet  performed  A few of the other officers still stayed with us  gallanting  at Paramaribo amongst whom were Major Medler and Captain Hemmet  The latter gentleman in the year sailed from the Texel to the Molucca islands where as commander in chief he killed the king of Pongue with his three sons and men and dethroned also the king of  Salangoo  whose land he captured for the Dutch EastIndia Company besides taking pieces of cannon c  who had both been with General Desalve's regiment in the colony  Berbicè  and previous to that the first was in the Prussian service It was no small change of appearance  The Musk Melon Water Melon PineApple  for us who had so little a time before appeared like wild men now to strut through Paramaribo dressed like so many  French marquees  Being a particular favourite of Governor Nepveu I one day was induced to ask him for a piece of  uncultivated  forest ground when he readily granted me acres but when I inconsiderately asked it of him I had not calculated how large a capital it required to clear away woods purchase negroes and provide other necessaries for such an undertaking and when a little reflection convinced me how difficult it would be to find a partner of abilities to assist me I declined accepting this mark of the governor's regard  Having on the th once more saved a poor black girl from receiving some hundred lashes by replacing a dozen of china which she had broken by accident while another was stabbed by a Frenchman who immediately cut his own throat from remorse and his companion an overseer hanged himself and having visited the poor negro whose leg had lately been cut off  by law  I packed my boxes to set out next morning on my sixth campaign and once more take the command of the River Comewina at which moment arrived at my lodgings six loaded negro slaves with presents from my hospitable friends of every kind that Guiana could produce and the colony of Surinam could afford me  CHAP XXV Singular Method of detecting a TheftRencounter between the Rangers and RebelsAmazonian Action of a black GirlWonderful Sagacity in wild BeesThe Regiment receives a second Order to return to Europe  CHAP XXV  ON the th of March adieu once more Paramaribo my Joanna and my boy  This morning a little before I sat out I saw a Mr  d'Halbergh  terribly bitten by a large iguana or lizard at the very moment he was pressing me and my companions to stay a few days to be present at the celebration of what he called his  Silverfeast  being the twentyfifth anniversary of his marriage but after condoling with him upon account of the accident we embarked in a tentbarge and arrived that evening at the Sporksgift estate in Matapica Here we were entertained two days by Captain Mac Neal with the greatest hospitality I was however nearly suffocated by the steam of some green coffee which was spread on the floor of the lodge where I had slung my hammock  Late on the evening of the th we arrived at the  Goldmine  plantation where we found a negro boy and girl suspended by each others side from a high beam by a rope fastened to their  thumbs  which were tied behind  their backs this almost dislocated their shoulders and must have occasioned the most agonizing tortures Thus I cut the miserable victims down without leave or ceremony and swore that instant to demolish the tyrannical overseer who had inflicted this new mode of punishment unless he promised immediately to forgive them which he miraculously did in my presence  On the th a little before we landed at the Hope I discovered that all my sugar with the greatest part of my rum was gone and detected the thief by the following laughable stratagem though not my own invention I told the negroes six in number that a parrot's feather was to grow within six minutes upon the tip of his nose who was most guilty at the same time pronouncing a few incoherent words and making two or three circles with my sabre I shut myself within the tilt here peeping through the keyhole and observing the rowers with great attention without their perceiving me I soon saw one of them at every stroke of the oar put up his hand and feel the tip of his nose upon which I instantly ran up to him and cried  "I see the parrot's feather Thou art the thief thou rascal"  To which the poor superstitious fellow instantly answered  "  Yaw me massera  "  then kneeling to the  sorcerer  for mercy and the others also intreating me to spare him I pardoned the credulous thief and his accomplices who by their candid confession obtained a piece of salt beef for their dinner and a gourd full of good grog in the bargain  Immediately on my arrival I took the command of the whole river and now was once more the Prince of Comewina I also built an elevated  palace  in imitation of  Prince Bonny  's at BoosyCry on twelve strong stakes which aerial habitation I found very necessary the whole post being almost under water by the inundations and by neglect become a perfect mirepool while of my former cottage not a vestige was to be seen Here I found the marines in perfect misery being almost naked and having sold their very shoes for a mouthful of fresh provisions These grievances however by my labour and intercession with Colonel Fourgeoud whose favourite I now became more and more were speedily redressed and the Hope in a little time appeared like a paradise when compared with its former state  Shooting was now as formerly my favourite diversion and on the th I brought home a kind of  plover  a couple of  redbreasts  and near a dozen  grasssparrows  The plover of Guiana is the size of a pigeon its colour a darkbrown and white with transverse bars The wet savannahs are full of them and they are delicate eating The redbreast is a kind of large bullfinch with the upper part of its body a deep chesnut and all the rest a bloodcolour this is reckoned as good as an ortolan and abounds on all the plantations The grasssparrow which I think is by some called the  anaca  is a beautiful little creature like a paroquet these birds are perfectly green with a white bill and red eyes They do  much damage amongst the rice and Indian corn flying in prodigious flocks upon the plantations  At the Hope the  trochulus  or hummingbirds were so thick among the tamarindtrees that they resembled a swarm of bees a Lieutenant  Swildens  daily fetching down several of them by blowing small peas or Indian corn through a hollow reed  Of all the tropical birds this little creature is particularly worth attention not only on account of its beauty but for its diminutive size being smaller than the first joint of a man's finger and when deprived of its feathers not larger than a bluebottle fly However there are several species and some twice as large These birds vary much in their colour in the shade they appear generally of a deep shining green which by the reflection of the sun produces a splendid purple brown and azure The head is crested with a small tust of feathers green black and gold the tail and wings are a glossy black the bill is not much thicker than a pin it is long black and crooked at the end the tongue is forked and resembles a red silk thread with this they sip the nectar or honey from the flowers during which time they are stationary exactly like bees and this juice seems to be the only nourishment of these little creatures They often make their nest on the leaf of a wild pineapple or dwarf aloe which is constructed mostly of cotton and not larger than the husk of a walnut their eggs are about the size of peas and only two in number Madam Merian says that the hummingbird  sits on  four  eggs which for my part I never saw or heard of during my residence in Guiana  In the annexed plate I have endeavoured to represent them and their little habitation in natural size though I found it impossible to make the drawing more perfect their motion upon the wing being so very quick that the feathers are hardly perceptible and this motion occasions that humming noise from which this delicate little creature derives its name  Here were also immense flocks of monkies I have seen above two hundred of them in a field of sugarcanes where they make great devastation These wary animals place sentinels all round the field to give the alarm and I myself have been a witness with what sagacity and fidelity they perform this duty when the whole company hop into the forest each with his plunder in his paw  Swimming was another of my favourite amusements which contributed to make me more healthy and stronger than most of my companions as it is beautifully expressed by the author of the  Seasons    "This is the purest exercise of health  "The kind refresher of the summer heats  " Hence the limbs  "Knit into force and the same Roman arm  "That rose victorious o'er the conquer'd earth  "First learn'd when tender to subdue the wave"  On the th I shot an alligator but returning from this excursion in a boat a packet of letters from Colonel  The Humming Bird with its nest c  Fourgeoud being reached me unfortunately fell overboard into the water and sank immediately some officers however the next day coming to the Hope informed me of the principal contents  viz  that Colonel Fourgeoud being determined once more to scour the woods had ordered me to send up all my spare men and provisions as also the Society troops who were now at Oranjebo the former to Magdenberg and the latter to the river Pirica which I performed retaining only twelve crippled soldiers at the Hope and as many at Clarenbeek without either surgeon or medicines nevertheless with this small number I made daily patroles by land and waterthey also informed me of the death of ensign  Van Halm  and that another ship with sick was ordered shortly to set sail for Holland  Colonel Fourgeoud though he himself remained still at Paramaribo yet continued attentively to command Thus on the d he ordered a detachment of one hundred men to reconnoitre from Magdenberg to the Wana Creek and Marawina river but they returned without any new discoveries  As I was now likely to be continued at the Hope for some time I sent for my sheep and poultry from the estate where I had left them presenting Mr  Gourly  with a ram and a ewe as being of a breed superior to any in the colony and I found with joy that my flocks had considerably encreased in numbers  On the th one of my men brought me a snake  which he had just killed it was about four feet long and not thicker than the barrel of a musket when perceiving a knob near its middle larger than my fist I had the curiosity to cut it open and an enormous frog made its appearance perfectly alive and entire a small spot on the back of its head and neck excepted which was blue and slimy as if beginning to putrify For the sake of experiment I fastened him with a string to his foot upon a grassplat near the river for three days when finding the poor animal hearty and well I gave him his liberty with a caution to keep a better lookout for the future  On the th I paid a visit to  Thomas Palmer  Esq late King's counsellor at Massachusett's Bay upon his estate called  Fairfield  Here both the master and his slaves were perfectly happy and contented chiefly owing to Mr Palmer's just and equitable administration to all around him and such were the consequences of his wise government that few plantations in the West Indies could boast of greater prosperity either in point of produce or population while the courtesy and hospitality of the gentlemanlike proprietor to strangers completed his happy character which shone conspicously throughout the colony  Upon my return to the Hope I received a letter from the commander in chief informing me that Mr Vinsack with his rangers had killed several rebels and taken eleven prisoners but that another party of the rangers had been surprized by the enemy and several of them shot dead while asleep in their hammocks  During these skirmishes an instance of presence of mind was exhibited by a rebel negro I think but seldom equalledA ranger having levelled his piece was just going to fire at him when the man called out holding up his hand  "What Sir do you mean to kill one of your own party"  Which the ranger believing him to be replied  "God forbid"  and dropping the muzzle of his piece instantly received a ball through the body from his adversary which killed him and who having thus saved himself disappeared like a flash of lightning One of the captive negroes related that the evening before they were taken a rebel who had formerly deserted from Fauconberg was cut to pieces with sabres by Bonny's command as two others had been before we took GadoSaby  On the th of May it blew a violent hurricane accompanied with thunder and lightning so that many trees were torn up by the roots and most of the houses on the Hope blown down or unroofed my aerial palace however by good fortune withstood this gale and upon the th Joanna with her boy arriving at this place I promised myself a scene of happiness equal to that I experienced in especially as my family my sheep and my poultry were now doubled besides I had at this time a beautiful garden and if I could not with propriety be called a planter I might at least claim with some degree of justice the name of a little farmer  On the th we all dined with Mr  de Graaff  at his beautiful  plantation  Knoppemombo  in Cassawina Creek where this worthy man had foretold before the birth of my boy that both he and his mother should one day be happy and free Here I saw the following roots and plants which I have not yet observedThe  tayers  which are the hearts of a farinaceous green shrub not above two or three feet high with remarkable large leaves in the form of a heart the trunk something resembling that of a bananatree This plant being cut down and with a knife divested of its outer tegument has the appearance and consistency of a yam or potatoe but is better eating having a much finer grain The tayers are of different kinds the smallest is preferred and made use of in the same manner as the above roots I have here also found a kind of real potatoe and in large quantities but they are only used by the negroes being inferior to the hogpotatoes in Great Britain  The  tobacco plant  grows here with large downy leaves full of fibres it flowers almost continually and will last for twelve or fourteen years but is so inferior to the Virginia tobacco that it is only used by the slaves This plant derived its name from the island  Tobago  where it was first discovered in  They have here also a kind of wild  tea  which is accounted very wholesome but in my opinion is no better than English groundivy I found plenty of  tomatè  which being produced in many British gardens I will not attempt to describe but only observe  that the Jews are particularly fond of it and stew it with butchers meat instead of onions  The  physicnut  tree is likewise to be met with here this is a knotty shrub that grows about ten or twelve feet in height and very slender the nut that it produces has a kernel like an almond and tastes as well provided it be deprived of a thin white skin that adheres to it otherwise a violent vomiting and purging is the immediate consequence of swallowing it They also shewed me several kinds of peas and beans and other fruits growing in pods such as the  cassia  a shining hard yellow seed inclosed in a woody shell near sixteen inches long and very small with a black soft pulp as sweet as honey this is considered as a very safe laxative the cassia grows on a tree very common in Guiana and which is called  soete boonties  and  cotiaan  Another kind of pod named  seveyaars boontie  is so called because it is said to be in blossom seven years before it produces The shrub called  snakee weereeweeree  also grows here they told me it was a sovereign remedy for fevers and I take it to be the same as the  serpentaria Virginiana  or Virginian snakeroot Lastly I saw a vegetable or flower here called  sevenboom  which is too frequently used by the young negro girls to promote abortion as are also the green pineapples which are said to have the same effect  Thus having spent not only an agreeable but an instructive day at Knoppemombo we took leave of our very good friend in the evening and rowed contentedly  back to the Hope our boat being nearly loaded with presents of every kind amongst which were some fine cocoanuts that one of his slaves after walking I may say more properly than climbing  See Vol II page plate L  up the tree had brought down in my presence and after a fierce engagement with a black serpent upon the very top of it which by the help of his knife he vanquished and to our admiration dropped it down dead at our feet  The slaves of the Hope and Fauconberg also testified their respect for Joanna and her boy by bringing in presents of fowls fruit eggs venison and fish and Mr Palmer handsomely presented us with a large quantity of Indian corn to feed our poultry Thus every thing seemed to contribute to our felicity which was however considerably allayed by the disagreeable news we received on the th informing me of the death of my dear friend Mr Walter Kennedy shortly after his arrival in Holland  This gentleman a little before his departure shewed me a letter from the unhappy youth  Campbell  which after thanking him for every civility and acquainting him with his dissolution which he had felt approach was signed  "Your's to eternity R C"  and to his father he had wrote the same  it was now also confirmed that the Dutch had refused the Scots Brigade to his Britannic Majesty which greatly surprized me as I considered it as a claim not only from affinity but also by treaty  To amuse my mind from these unpleasing subjects I now paid a short visit to my French acquaintance  Monsieur  Cachelieu  at his plantation Egmond Here amongst other company I met with an Italian a planter called D'Os who had but one arm with which however he took up a knife at table and without the smallest provocation as I sat next him made a back thrust at me to the astonishment of all who were present Having fortunately parried the blow by beating up his elbow which occasioned the point of his knife to pass over my shoulder I started up and was going to put him instantly to death but this being prevented I offered to fight him with one hand tied behind me and with any instrument he chose fist bludgeon sword pistol or even knife this the cowardly assassin having refused was kicked out of company and sent home to his plantation called  Hazard  So violent was this unhappy man's disposition that some little time before he ordered a poor negro woman who was advanced eight months in her pregnancy to be flogged until her intestines appeared and that only for breaking a tumbler One of his male slaves trying to evade his severity was shot dead on the spot and there was not a slave belonging to his estate but was cut by the lash of his whip from the neck to the heel  Colonel Fourgeoud now sending a proper supply of men with a surgeon and medicines the Hope wore a more pleasing aspect and health and content began to be visible in every countenance Amongst other things I encouraged the men to catch fish which were here in abundance and the negroes taught them how to make  the proper snares such as the  springhook  and  mansoa  or springbasket I have given a representation of both these in the plate annexed where the springhook is expressed by the letter  A  being a long elastic pole like a strong fishingrod stuck in the ground under water at the other end of which is fixed a double line the shortest having fastened to it a small stick ten inches long and the other the same but a little lower while at the extremity of  this  line is hooked a small fish by the fins in such a manner as to swim to and fro and be a bait for the larger species Two long sticks being next placed in the ground so as to appear above water a third stick much shorter forms them like a gallows above this gallows is bent and fixed the elastic pole by means of the double line and its beams but in so very slight a manner that upon the least touch the whole apparatus gives way and the large pole erects itself when the fish that occasioned the spring by taking the bait is suspended to the hook in the air as exhbited by the figure  B  The  mansoa  or springbasket is much upon the same construction and may be seen by referring to letter  C  where it is represented open and under water with the bait swimming in it This basket is made of warimbo reeds in the form of a sugarloaf the above apparatus being fixed to the middle in the small end of which the elastic pole is fastened while at the other end is an open trapdoor the whole being supported in an erect position  Manner of catching Fish by the SpringHook  Manner of catching Fish by the SpringBasket  by a forked stick No sooner has a large fish entered and taken the bait than this pole as in the former erects itself with a spring and the snap or trapdoor shuts on the invader and he is taken as may be seen by letter  D  This differs from the former no hook of any kind being necessary An idea of the ingenuity of the negroes may be formed from these constructions as this mode of catching their fish requires no attendance for the snaps being set at night the fish is found in the morning which is generally the newmara or barracota already described  Among the variety of fish caught here was the  siliba  a small oval fish marked not unlike a pineapple the  sokay  which is a large fish and very good eating the  torrotorro  and another called  tarpoen  the first three feet in length the other which is white about two feet six inches  On the th I saw a most surprising display of activity strength and courage by a young female negro called  Clardina  at the Hope where a wild stag having strayed from the flock at the moment it came bounding over the footpath she seized it in full speed by the hinder leg but not being able to stop it she suffered herself to be dragged to a considerable distance nor until she was terribly wounded would she let go her hold  The Hope was now truly a charming habitation being perfectly dry even in springtides and washed by pleasing canals that let in the freshwater every tide while the hedges surrounding the fields and gardens were  neatly cut and produced fruit and vegetables of many species for our use The houses and bridges were also all repaired while the strictest adherence to cleanliness was recommended and enforced among the men by these means not one sick person out of fifty was now to be found where sloth stench and disease had so lately spread their destructive influence and to which the land and seascurvy had given the most fatal assistance Of the above scorbutic complaints the former covers the body over with blotches and the latter chiefly affects the teeth and gums  I now enjoyed the greatest flow of health and spirits while most of my old shipmates were either dead or returned to Europe not a single officer at this time being in rank above me except only such as had been formerly inured to the West India climate  But to return to my gardenthis at present exhibited carrots cabbages onions cucumbers lettuces radishes pepper cresses c all thriving as well as in Europe besides sorrel of two kinds the common and the red this last grows upon a shrub and is excellent for making jam or marmalade The jessamine also was found here of different species that growing on a small tree being most admired it is of a pale but beautiful red colour and a most agreeable smell the leaves are thick shining and filled with a milky juice A species of sensitive shrub they call  shameshame  grew also here as did the sleeping plant so called from its leaves which are set in pairs  clapping close together from sunset to sunrise and appearing as if the two were but one but as soon as the sun is up they again open and resume their double form The abovementioned shrubs were all dispersed through my hedges besides pomegranates and Indian roses which blow every day while a few elegant redlilies which also grow wild in the savannas adorned the banks of my canals the leaves of which flower have a very bright and beautiful green polish  Thus situated we were visited amongst others by a Madame  de Ze  in company with her brother and a Mr  Schadts  who were lately arrived from Holland this lady was supposed the finest woman that even Europe produced as well as the most accomplished She spoke several languages and was a perfect mistress of music and painting she danced elegantly and rode vastly well on horseback she even excelled in shooting and fencing c In order to make her perfect mistress of all the fashionable exercises I offered her my assistance in teaching her to swim which however with a smile she thought proper to refuse  My soldiers and even negroes seemed now completely happy amongst whom the most perfect harmony subsisted while I frequently indulged them with a merry evening and a greybeard of rum  One night in the midst of this festivity I secretly ordered the sentinel to fire his piece and cause a false alarm as if the enemy were on the estate when I had  the satisfaction to see them seize their arms and rush out with the utmost order and intrepidity This experiment I was the rather inclined to put in practice as it was reported that the rebels intended soon to pay a visit to the River Comewina But we soon experienced that no scene of perfect felicity can be lasting for the dry season now suddenly settingin disease and mortality once more began to rage among us ten or twelve men dying daily at the Java Creek and Magdenburg while those under my command at the Hope diminished hourly  On the d the surgeon made me the following report  "That my Ensign Mr  Decabanes  had his anchorapeek and would certainly set sail for the other world with the ebbtide"  which was really the case for he died that very evening This grieved me the more as he had obtained his commission through my interest and bore an excellent character  On the th of June the springflood broke down my dams while we were drinking the King's health and laid the whole post under water which created vast confusion and in this distress the overseer  Blenderman  refused to lend me any assistance which occasioned so violent a quarrel that he was glad to take to his heels and make his escape from the plantation I shall never have done mentioning the insolence of these savage brutes who mostly are the refuse of the earth brought up in Germany or elsewhere under the cane of a corporal  "Well" said one of these miscreants ironically to an old  free  negro "don't you believe that the monkies are a race of damn'd Christians who have been thus transformed for shewing so much lenity to such as you"    "No sir" replied the black man "we do not think that the monkies are damn'd Christians but I and all of us believe that many who call themselves Christians are a pack of damn'd monkies"  Which pointed repartee afforded me infinite satisfaction  Of the administrators I shall say nothing nor of the appraisers of estates having I believe already mentioned that the first got ten  per cent  of all the produce and many of the latter enrich the purchasers and themselves by selling under the value such property as is entrusted to their care  On the th Mr  Moryn  administrator of the Hope being in a piece of newlycultivated ground on the opposite shore I rowed over to obtain satisfaction of the impertinent Blenderman who was along with him but this fellow's cowardice being equal to his insolence and barbarity he made every concession and promised likewise to repair my dams rather than run the risque of broken bonesthus a reconciliation was established  Walking through these new fields where a neat house was already built I saw some beautiful birds amongst which was the  woodpecker  I ought indeed to have described this bird before and another the name unknown to me having had an opportunity of doing it when I was at Magdenburg but I then took only drawings of them  The woodpecker is about the size of a thrush and of an elegant cinnamoncolour speckled with dark brown and yellow near the rump it is entirely yellow the head is crested with a fine crown of small feathers of the same colour as the body the tail is long and black the bill is straight and of a seagreen colour as are the legs and iris of the eyes under which on each side are two spots of beautiful crimson  The anonymous bird which however the negroes called  woodolousofowlo  from its feeding on woodlice is larger than the former and uncommonly brilliant in its plumage the head and upper part of its body being of a rich grass green the breast and belly crimson divided by an ashcoloured bar The tail is long and of a dark blue as are the prime feathers in the wings which are also divided from the green by another ashcoloured bar the bill is yellow and hooked being surrounded by a number of small black feathers as are the eyes the iris of which is of a blood colour Both these birds may be seen in the annexed plateAs I have already observed however rich and beautiful the plumage may be which decorates the groves of Surinam the melodious song there is but seldom heard They had also here the tame  galinas  or Guineahens called  tokay  which being so well known in England require no particular description  Among the plants which I saw here was the  American aloe  above half a foot in thickness and twenty feet high it is an evergreen pithy within and without covered  The Yellow Woodpecker Woodlouse fowl  with sharppointed follicles growing less as they approach the summit This tree has numerous thick leaves diverging at its base like the pineapple plant which are very long broad pointed and dentulated with strong prickles On the top grows a cluster of yellow flowers whose pedicles contain the seed of future aloes and which never fail to come to perfection in the space of two months  In the skirts of the surrounding woods I saw also the  vanillas  or  banilla  which is a shrub that climbs up along the trunks of other trees adhering to the back like nebees or ivy by the help of its tendrils the leaves are prodigiously thick and dark green the fruit consisting of a triangular pod six or eight inches long and filled with small polished seeds These pods being dried a fortnight in the sun become brown and have a fat rich aromatic taste and most agreeable flavour on which account they are used to scent the chocolate There are different kinds of  vanilla  but that is most esteemed which has its pods the most long and most slender The negroes shewed me here also a small sweetish seed which they called  bongora  As I returned to the Hope I met Cojo Joanna's uncle who had shot one of the  bowling baboons  which he brought to the Hope to shew it me These animals are the size of a small bulldog and the colour a reddishbrown with long hair they have also a beard and are upon the whole extremely ugly but what chiefly distinguishes them from other monkies is their abominable  howl which they perform in chorus whole groupes together and so loud that it may be heard above a mile these discordant concerts the negroes told me they generally repeat both night and day at the time of high water which it is supposed the baboons know by instinctWhen speaking of instinct in animals I cannot omit relating the following singular fact after which I shall return to the historical part of my narrative  On the th I was visited by a neighbouring gentleman whom I conducted up my ladder but he had no sooner entered my aerial dwelling than he leapt down from the top to the ground roaring like a madman with agony and pain after which he instantly plunged his head into the river but looking up I soon discovered the cause of his distress to be an enormous nest of wild bees or  wasseewassee  in the thatch directly above my head as I stood within my door when I immediately took to my heels as he had done and ordered them to be demolished by my slaves without delay A tar mop was now brought and the devastation just going to commence when an old negro stepped up and offered to receive any punishment I should decree if ever one of these bees should sting  me in person  "Massera" said he "they would have stung you long ere now had you been a stranger to them but they being your tenants that is gradually allowed to build upon your premisses they assuredly know both you and your's and will never hurt either you or them"  I instantly assented to the  proposition and tying the old black man to a tree ordered my boy Quaco to ascend the ladder quite naked which he did and was  not  stung I then ventured to follow and I declare upon my honour that even after shaking the nest which made its inhabitants buz about my ears not a single bee attempted to sting me I next released the old negro and rewarded him with a gallon of rum and five shillings for the discovery This swarm of bees I since kept unhurt as my bodyguards and they have made many overseers take a desperate leap for my amusement as I generally sent them up my ladder upon some frivolous message when I wished to punish them for injustice and cruelty which was not seldom  The above negro assured me that on his master's estate was an ancient tree in which had been lodged ever since he could remember a society of  birds  and another of  bees  who lived in the greatest harmony together but should any strange birds come to disturb or feed upon the bees they were instantly repulsed by their feathered allies and if strange bees dared to venture near the birds nests the native swarm attacked the invaders and stung them to death that his master and family had so much respect for the above association that the tree was considered as sacred and was not to be touched by an axe until it should yield to alldestroying time  On the d a patrole arrived from Rietwyk in Pirica who informed me that a party of our troops were just returned to Java Creek from a cruize to  Vredenburg  at  the Marawina and that in conjunction with the rangers they had during this campaign destroyed many fields of provisions belonging to the rebels also that for their faithful services our sable allies had been complimented by the Society with new arms and for the first time cloathed in green uniform jackets I further learned that the  ambassadors  to the  Owca  and  Serameca  negroes were returned after a fruitless journey as neither of these associations would lend the smallest assistance In consequence of this refusal Colonel Fourgeoud being wearied himself and having exhausted his troops in destroying most of the rebel settlements at length determined to relinquish the whole expedition which resolution he previously communicated to his Serene Highness the Prince of Orange at the Hague  On the d I received positive orders to prepare and be ready on the th of July to break up with all the troops under my command leave the River Comewina and row down to Paramaribo where the transport ships were put in commission to convey us back to Holland This order I instantly read before the front to all my men who received it with unbounded joy and three cheersbut I alone sighed bitterly Oh my Joanna Oh my boy who were at this time both dangerously ill the one with a fever the other with convulsions so that neither were expected to survive Add to this that I ran a nail quite through my footthus was completely miserable  During this scene of sickness and distress the  strix  or  nightowl  of Guiana regularly paid us his nocturnal visits even in the apartment where we lay pouring out his melancholy hootings until he was killed by one of my black attendants This bird is here called  Ooroocoocoo  from its note to which this word has some affinity It is about the size of a pigeon the bill is yellow and hooked like that of a sparrowhawk the eyes are also yellow the tongue is cloven the ears very visible the legs strong short and armed with sharp claws the general colour of this bird is a pale brown except the breast and belly which are white intermixed with some spots of amber The superstitious negroes generally believe that where the nightowl makes his appearance mortality must ensue which prejudice is the more excusable as this creature only frequents the apartments of the sick but the real cause which attracts the animal I apprehend to be the  lights  that upon these occasions are generally kept burning all night or possibly the morbid and putrid air which excites its appetite for prey  An old Indian woman of Joanna's acquaintance being now sent for to the Hope I myself was soon cured by her skill and attention but my little family continued so very unwell that I thought it right to send them to Paramaribo before it was too late And on the th of July I sent all my sheep and poultry to Fauconberg one couple of fat ewes excepted which I killed and with which by the addition of fish and venison I entertained for two days following twentyfour of the most respectable inhabitants  in the river while the white bread fruit and Spanish wines to help out the feast I received as a present from my very worthy friend Mr James Gourland at Berghoven  On the th I ordered down the troops from  Clarenbeek  where an hospital had been a  second  time erected and they this evening anchored off the Hope  On the th an officer of the Honourable Society troops arrived to relieve me in the command of the river and his men from that moment began to perform the duty  I now removed my flag from the Hope to the barges and in the evening took my last farewel of Joanna's relations on the Fauconberg estate who crouding round me expressed their sorrow aloud for my departure and with tears invoked the protection of Heaven for my safe and prosperous voyage  On the th we finally left the Hope having marched my troops on board the barges at ten o'clock A M and at noon I fired my pistol as a signal to weigh anchor when we immediately proceeded down the River Comewina for the roads of Paramaribo to be embarked on board the transport ships for Europe  CHAP XXVI The Troops on BoardAgain ordered to disembarkGreat DejectionMutinyInsolent Conduct of an Owca Negro CaptainNear two hundred Sick sent to HollandGeneral Description of the African Negroes  ON the evening of the th of July  CHAP XXVI  we anchored off the estate Berkshoven where I spent the night ashore with my friend Gourley and in the morning we continued to row down the river when I took my last farewel of Mr Palmer I passed the evening of the th with Captain Mac Neyl and on the th the whole fleet consisting of my own barges together with three from Magdenberg and those from the River Cottica arrived safe at anchor in the roads of Paramaribo where three transports lay ready to receive us on board of which vessels I immediately embarked all the troops that had come down under my command  This service being accomplished I went ashore and made my report to Colonel Fourgeoud after which I went to visit Joanna and her boy whom to my great joy I found very much recovered  The following day I was again sent on board to make the necessary arrangements for the voyage and on the th I dined with Colonel Fourgeoud where to my  surprize I found two species of fish which I have never mentioned the one is called the  haddock  being much like ours but rather larger and whiter coloured the other the  separee  which a little resembles the skait At the dessert was a fruit called in Surinam  zurzacka  which I believe by the English is called the  soursap  It grows upon a tree of a moderate size with a grey bark and leaves like those of the orangetree but set in pairs the fruit is of a pyramidical form heavier than the largest pear and all covered over with inoffensive prickles the skin is very thin the pulp a soft pithy substance as white as milk and of a sweet taste mixed with a most agreeable acid in which are seeds like the large kernels of an apple Another species of  small zurzacka  grows in this country something resembling hops but is of no use whatever We had also the fruit called  sabatille  which grows on a large tree the leaves like those of the laurel This fruit is the size of a peach very round and of a brown colour covered over with a soft down when cut in two the pulp is not unlike marmalade in which are found the seeds it is such a luscious sweet that to many palates it is even disagreeable  On the st we once more received our clearance but in card money by which we all lost very considerably however I instantly went to Mrs Godefroy and again gave her all the money that was in my pocket being no more than £ This excellent woman now renewed her entreaties that I should carry my boy and his mother  with me to Holland but to no purpose Joanna was perfectly immoveable even to a degree of heroism and no persuasion could make the least impression upon her until her redemption should be made complete by the payment of the very last farthing In this situation we affected to bear our fate with perfect resignation though what each of us felt in particular may much more easily be imagined than described  The regiment's colours were now carried on board on the d in great state which put a final close to the expedition but without receiving any  honours  from Fort Zealandia not a single gun being fired nor even the flag hoisted on the occasion to the great mortification of Colonel Fourgeoud though in effect it was chiefly owing to his own neglect as he had never given the Governor  official  notice of his intended departure The baggage was also sent on board the ships and a gentleman of the name of  Van Heyst  entertained the marines at his private expence with three hundred bottles of wine fruit c  I have often remarked the hospitality and generosity of these people which I now also once more experienced receiving various presents of fruits and preserves from my numerous friends to refresh me at sea while on the voyage amongst the preserves were the female  pappayas  the male bearing no fruit This grows on a grey trunk near twenty feet high straight and pithy within the top being covered with a crown and only fourteen or sixteen diverging leaves extremely large and digitated The fruit grows close to the trunk the flower or blossom has  a most delicious fragrance When ripe it is the size and shape of a watermelon and turns from green to yellow but its pulp is more firm and solid the inner pulp is soft and slimy filled with innumerable seeds This fruit at full maturity is cut in pieces and boiled when it eats like English turnips but they use it principally for confectionary and sweetmeats when young and with its blossoms being both extremely delicate and wholesome I had also sent me some fine preserved  ginger  this is the root of a kind of reedy stalk that never exceeds two feet in height with long narrow pointed leaves These roots are tuberous flattish small and clustered in many different shapes not unlike pigpotatoes and of nearly the same colour in the inside but fibrous acid hot and aromatic the smell is highly fragrant it is well known to be not only an agreeable preserve but in many cases an excellent medicineBut to proceed  On the th of July the sails being bent to the yards we  at last  proceeded in corps to take leave of his Excellency the Governor of the colony who while he still received us with the greatest politeness yet gave our hero to understand that were his colours  now  to be sent on board they should most certainly be saluted with those  honours  which indisputably were their due After which he sent the whole corps of Society officers to the headquarters in state to wish us a prosperous voyage to Holland and in this contest of etiquette his Excellency most assuredly led the van for hinting which however to some of Fourgeoud's favourites I had nearly engaged myself once more  in a serious quarrel Our men who had been on board since the th being now joined by their officers the poor remains of this fine regiment were thus finally embarked and in the highest flow of spirits expecting to set sail the  following day  for Europe while  one  alone excepted every countenance wore the appearance of happiness and joy and nothing indeed could equal the exultation of the few surviving troops when the next morning the orders were issued for the ships to weigh anchor and put to sea  But it was by fate ordained that their eager hopes and expectations once more should be blasted for on the very moment of departure a ship entered the river with dispatches inclosing an order for the regiment immediately to  reenter the woods  and remain in the colony until relieved by fresh troops to be sent out from Holland for that purpose The SINCERE THANKS of his Serene Highness the Prince of Orange were now read to the men from the quarterdeck of each vessel  "for the manly and spirited conduct they had displayed during so long a trial and so many great and unprecedented hardships"  but as they concluded with orders for the troops to  disembark  and remain in this dreadful service I never saw dejection disappointment and despair so strongly marked while at this moment I who but just before had been completely miserable was now in turn the only one who was not depressed with sorrow  In the midst of this gloomy scene the men were ordered to give three cheers which the marines on board one of the vessels absolutely refused to comply with Colonel Scyburg and unluckily myself were in consequence ordered to compel them which he undertook with a cane in one hand and a loaded pistol cocked in the other Knowing his temper to be fiery and irascible what did I not feel at this moment I suddenly leapt into the boat that lay alongside where after haranguing those few that leaned over the gunwale I promised the  ship's crew  twenty gallons of Holland's gin if  they  would only begin the melancholy chorus Then mounting again the quarterdeck I acquainted the Colonel that all were  now  ready and willing to obey his commands we then reentered the boat and in shoving off had the satisfaction to receive three hearty cheers from the sailors in which joined a few marines but with such languid looks and heavy hearts as cannot be described  At this time however the Prince of Orange's goodness of heart appeared in a conspicuous light as he ordered all private accounts due by the troops to surgeons and physicians to be paid by the treasury which however trifling it may appear was no trifle to many of the officers c and evinced an attention in his Serene Highness which is not always to be found in princes while all knew his sorrow for the hard lot of his soldiers but which could not yet be dispensed with consistent with the general good  If our disembarkation distressed the troops it afforded joy to most of the colonists as indeed a petition signed by the principal inhabitants had been presented to Colonel Fourgeoud but two days before  "praying that our regiment might stay some time longer and give the finishing stroke to the rebels as we had so gloriously begun and persevered in routing and harassing them"  which indeed was certainly true for our regiment in conjunction with the Society and rangers had demolished most settlements the rebels possessed in the colony and had driven them to so considerable a distance that their depredations and the desertion of slaves were incomparably less than upon our arrival and this was assuredly much better than the Dutch making a shameful peace with them as had been done with the rebels of the  Owca  and  Sarameca  settlements before yet which would probably again have been the consequence had we not landed in Guiana  As an instance of the insolence of  savages  when perfectly independant I must relate a conversation which passed between one of this description and myself at Paramaribo where the troops were allowed some time to refresh themselves before they again retook the field Dining one day at Captain Mac Neyl's who was now come to town from his estate a captain of the  Owca  negroes our  supposed  allies came in to demand money from his lady and being very importunate I desired her in English to  "give him a dram and he would be gone"  which the fellow understanding called me without the  door and lifting up his silverheaded cane asked me  "If that house was my own and if not what business I had to interfere"  "I am said he in a thundering voice "Captain  Fortune DagoSo  and if I had you in my country at Owca I would make the very earth drink up your blood"  To which I replied drawing my sword  "That my name was Stedman and that if he dared to utter one insolent expression more my weapon should find the shortest way through his body"  Upon which he snapped his fingers and marched off leaving me much displeased and blaming Fourgeoud for shewing so much indulgence to such a set of banditti In the evening as I returned from dinner I met the same black fellow again who stepping short up to me said  "Massera you are a man a very brave fellow won't you now give some money to the Owca Captain"  This I sternly refused he then kissed my hand and shewed his teeth he said in token of reconciliation promising to send me a present of pistachionuts which however never did arrive nor indeed should I have tasted  Though we continued in Surinam some time longer our future services could add but very little to its prosperity as our numbers were now so very few and out of this number small as it was  nine  officers and above  one hundred and sixty  privates all sick and incurable embarked again for Holland on the st of August I was ill with an ague at this time and had the offer of making one of the party but declined it being determined to see the end of the expedition if I could I however availed myself  of the opportunity to send some presents to my friends in Europe amongst these were a couple of beautiful parrots two curious monkies an elegant collection of fine butterflies three chests of sweetmeats and some pickles all shipped on board the ship  Paramaribo  and under the care of Serjeant Fowler who was poor fellow one of the invalids bound for Amsterdam  Major  Medlar  being quite emaciated with fatigue and hardships now also sailed for Holland thus during his absence acting as major I began to entertain an expectation that I should one day carry home the regiment myself so very rapidly were our officers daily diminishing and yet amongst those few who remained two had the courage at this time to venture upon matrimony and married two Creole ladies both widows  Every thing now being peaceable and quiet I recovered my strength so far as on the th to walk to Mrs Godefroy when I acquainted her that I wished much to emancipate at least  Johnny Stedman  and requested her to become bail before the court for the usual sum of £ as he should never be any charge to the colony of Surinam But this she peremptorily declined though there was no risque it being only a matter of form at which I could not help feeling some astonishment till I was acquainted that she had actually refused the same favour to her own son  The mention of slavery reminds me of a debt which I seem to have incurred to my reader I have from time to time given some account of the mode in which  slaves are brought to this market and of the manner in which they are treatedBut I feel that I have not been sufficiently full upon this subject and I am the more disposed to bring forward all the information that I have gained concerning the negroes because I flatter myself that I shall be able to bring some truths to light that have hitherto been unobserved or imperfectly related at least to the generality of Europeans  In the first place as to the complexion of a negro this as I have observed before is I am persuaded entirely owing to the burning climate in which he lives and an atmosphere still more heated by the sandy desarts over which the trade winds pass before they reach the habitable parts The Indians of America on the contrary who indeed live under the same degree of latitude have this wind refreshed by the Atlantic Ocean and are coppercoloured and the inhabitants of Abyssinia who receive it cooled by the Arabian and the Indian Seas are entirely olive Thus north of the great River Senegal the complexion changes from black to brown amongst the Moors as it does toward the south amongst the Caffrarians and the Hottentots and I am of opinion that the woolly texture of their hair is an effect proceeding from the same cause The epidermis or cuticle of the negroes I have seen dissected more than once it is clear and transparent but between this and the real skin lies a thin follicle which is perfectly black which being removed by severe flagellation or by scalding exposes a complexion not inferior to that of an European  On the estate  Vossenbergh  in Surinam were born two  white negroes  whose parents were both perfectly black the one was a female sent to Paris in the other a boy born in March And in a similar woman  Emelia Lewsam  was exhibited in England whose children though she is married to an European are all mulattoes The skin of these people is not of the European white but more resembles chalk their hair the same their eyes are often red  This is well known to be the case with many other animals as rabbits mice c that are perfectly white to have their eyes  bloodcoloured  and they see very little in the sunshine neither are they fit for any kind of labour while their mental faculties I have been told usually correspond with the debility of their bodies  With respect to the  shape  of the African negroes it is from head to foot certainly different from the European mould though not in my opinion in any degree inferior prejudice being laid aside Their strong features flat noses thick lips and high cheek bones may appear deformities to us and yet amongst themselves may be esteemed the reverse their bright black eyes and fine white teeth we are forced to admire and one decided advantage in a black complexion is that all those languid pale sicklylooking countenances so common in Europe are never exhibited among them nor are the wrinkles and ravages of age equally conspicuous though I must confess that when a negro is very ill his black changes to a very disagreeable sallow olive  For exertion and activity their shape is assuredly preferable to ours being generally strong and muscular near the trunk and slender towards the extremities they have mostly a remarkable fine chest but are small about the hips their buttocks are more prominent and their necks are thicker than ours the thighs are strong as also the arms above the elbow but the wrists and lower part of the legs are very slender and a good deal indeed of the Herculean make of the late  Broughton  the pugilist may be traced in the form of a vigorous negro As to the crookedness of their limbs it is to be accounted for by the manner in which they are carried whilst infants upon the mother's back their tender legs being tied close round each side of her waist which occasions that unnatural bent with which they are not born nor are their children ever taught to walk but left to creep amongst the sand and grass until they gradually acquire strength and inclination to erect themselves which they do very soon by this custom however the position of their feet is much neglected yet by exercise and daily bathing they acquire that strength and agility for which they are so remarkable  Another custom which in their opinion conduces much to their health and vigour is that during the  two  years in which the mothers suckle their children they frequently make them swallow large quantities of water after which they shake them twice a day with much violence they are then taken by a leg or an arm and  tossed into the river to be well scoured outwardly nor are the females exempt from this mode of rearing youth which renders them not inferior to the men in size alone excepted while some in running swimming climbing and dancing as well as wrestling are even their superiors thus that it depends on education to form a race of  Amazonian  females is a proposition of which I have very little doubt  Nor are these hardy daughters of the Torrid Zone less remarkable for propagation I knew a female servant at Mr de Graaf's called  Lesperanza  who actually bore  nine  children in the course of three years the first year four the next two and the third three They bring their offspring into the world without pain and like the Indian women resuming their domestic employments even the same day During the first week their infants are as fair as any Europeans except that in the males there is a little appearance of black in a  certain part  and the whole body becomes gradually of that colour Their females arrive early at the age of puberty but as in the fruits of this climate this early maturity is succeeded by a sudden decay Many of the negroes however live to a very considerable age I have seen one or two that were above one hundred and the London Chronicle for October makes mention of a negro woman called  Louisa Truxo  at  Tucomea  in South America still living at the surprizing age of one hundred and seventyfive years In what tables of longevity is there such an European to be found though most probably  this venerable person spent her youth in hard labour like other slaves which though a negro can bear much better in a tropical climate than a native of Europe yet cannot be natural either on the coast of Guinea or Guiana where without toil the necessaries of life are produced and vegetation flourishes spontaneously for ever  In the constitution of the negroes I have still observed this singularity that while they bear the fatigue of labour in the hottest days they can also bear the cold and damp better than an European at least better than I could sleeping all night on the wet grass perfectly naked without any injury to their health while I have been glad especially early in the morning to have a fire lit under my hammock and while the marines for want of it lay in a shiver They also bear hunger and thirst and pain or sickness with the greatest patience and resolution  I have formerly mentioned the names of more than a dozen of negro tribes all these know each other by the different marks and incisions made on their bodies for instance the  Coromantyn  negroes who are most esteemed cut three or four long gashes on each of their cheeks as represented in the face of the armed free negro or ranger in plate VII  The  Loango  negroes who are reckoned the worst distinguish themselves by puncturing or marking the skin of their sides arms and thighs with square elevated figures something like dice See plate LXVIII These  also cut their foreteeth to a sharp point which gives them a frightful appearance resembling in some degree those of a shark and all their males are circumcised after the manner of the Jews  Among the strange productions of nature a species of people known by the name of  Accorees  deserves to be particularly noticedThe  Accorees  or Twofingers live amongst the Seramaca negroes in the very upper parts of the river of that name This heterogeneous tribe are so deformed in their hands and feet that while some have three or four fingers and toes on each hand and foot others have only two which resemble the claws of a lobster or rather limbs that have been cured after mutilation by fire or some other accident This deformity in one person would cause but small admiration but that a whole community should be afflicted with this singularity is certainly a most wonderful phaenomenon Having seen but  two  myself and that at too great a distance to take a drawing of them I cannot pretend to vouch for the truth of what I have only heard but an engraving of one of these figures was positively sent to the Society of Arts and Sciences at  Haerlem  while I beg leave to introduce as a further voucher the following extract from an old book of surgery and anatomy procured me by the ingenious and learned  Owen Cambridge  Esquire of  Twickenham  "After Michaelmas term in the year a body was brought from the place of execution to the College of Physicians to be cut up for an anatomy and by chance  the officer of the college brought the body of a cruel wretch who had murdered the son of one Master Scot a surgeon of good note in this city This wretch was of a very truculent countenance and aspect his hair was black and curled not very long but thick and bushy his forehead little above an inch high his brows great and prominent his eyes set deep in their sockets his nose crooked with a round knob or button at the end which also somewhat turned upwards on his upper lip he had some quantity of black hair on his chin very few straggling black and stiff and his nether lip was as big as three lips Such was his face but the greatest deformity was his feet and that almost to admiration for they were both cloven but not alike One foot was equally divided between four and five inches deep into two toes jointed like other men's toes but as large each of them as half the foot could make them with nails proportionable The left foot was divided likewise in the middle but the division was not above three inches deep or scarce so much the one half which was towards the body made one large toe with a nail proportionable like the inward half of the right foot but the outward half was compounded of two toes yet growing close and fast together This monstrous shape of a man I have thought good to give this relation of from certain knowledge for there were a thousand witnesses of it present"  With the languages of the African negroes I am but  little acquainted as a specimen however I will insert a few sentences of that called the  Coromantyn  upon the credit of my boy Quaco who belonged to that nation together with a translation in English and only observe that they break off their words very short in a kind of guttural manner which I cannot easily describeFor instance  "  Co fa ansyo na baramon bra  Go to the river and bring me some water"    "  Mee yeree nacomeda mee  My wife I want some food"  So much for the Coromantyn language as spoken by the negroes on the coast of Guinea  But as to that spoken by the black people in Surinam I consider myself a perfect master it being a compound of Dutch French Spanish Portuguese and English The latter they like best and consequently use the most It has been already observed that the English were the first Europeans who possessed this colony hence probably the predilection for that language which they have still retained In this mixed dialect for which I have seen a printed grammar the words end mostly with a vowel like the Indian and Italian and it is so sweet so sonorous and soft that the genteelest Europeans in Surinam speak little else it is also wonderfully expressive and sentimental such as  "Good eating  sweetymuffo  "    "Gunpowder  man sanny  "    "I will love you with all my heart so long as I live  Mee saloby you langa alla mee hatty so langa me leeby  "    "A pleasing tale  ananassy  tory  "    "I am very angry  me hatty brun  "    "Live long so long until your hair become white as cotton  Lebee langa tay tay tay you weeree weeree tan wity likee catoo  "    "Small  peekeen  "    "Very smalle  peekeeneenee  "    "Farewel Goodbye I am dying and going to my God  Adioso cerroboay mee de go dede me de go na mee Gado  "  In this sample many corrupt English words are perceptible which however begin to grow out of use near the capital but are still retained in the distant plantations for instance at the estate  GoetAccoord  in Cottica I have heard an old negro woman say  "We lobee fo lebee togeddere  by which she meant we love to live together and at Paramaribo to express the same sentence  "  Wee looko for tanna macandera  "  Their  vocal music  is like that of the birds melodious but without time and in other respects not unlike that of a  clerk  performing to the congregation one person constantly pronouncing a sentence extempore which he next hums or whistles and then all the others repeat the same in chorus another sentence is then spoken and the chorus is a second time renewed c  This kind of singing is much practised by the barge rowers or boat negroes on the water especially during the night in a clear moonshine it is to them peculiarly animating and may together with the sound of their oars be heard at a considerable distance  As a specimen I have tried to set the following words  to music supposing a ranger going to battle and thus taking leave of his girl  Oan bus adiosi o da so adiosso me de go me loby fo fighty me man o  One buss goodby o 'tis so goodby girl I must go I love for to fight like a man o  Amimba  me dego na boosy o da so adiosso me do go  Amimba  I go to the woods o 'tis so goodby girl I must go  Such is their vocal melody and of their instrumental music and dancing which is perfectly to time I shall speak hereafter having already given a short account of that which is practised by the Loango negroes That these people are neither divested of a good ear nor poetical genius has been frequently proved when they have had the advantages of a good education Amongst others  Phillis Wheatley  who was a slave at  Boston  in New England learned the Latin language and wrote thirtyeight elegant pieces of poetry on different subjects which were published in As a specimen I cannot refrain here inserting the following extract from that entitled "  Thoughts on Imagination  "  "Now here now there the roving fancy flies  "Till some lov'd object strikes her wand'ring eyes  "Whose silken fetters all the senses bind  "And soft captivity invades the mind  "Imagination who can sing thy force  "Or where describe the swiftness of thy course  "Soaring through air to find the bright abode  "Th' imperial palace of the thundering God  "We on thy pinions can surpass the wind  "And leave the rolling universe behind  "From star to star the mental optics rove  "Measure the skies and range the realms above  "There in one view we grasp the mighty whole  "Or with new worlds amaze th' unbounded soul"  What can be more beautiful and sublime  Ignatius Sancho  a negro many years servant to the Duke of Montagu whose sentimental letters so generally known would not disgrace the pen of an European may also be mentioned on this occasion and with regard to their powers of memory and calculation I shall only notice  Thomas Fuller  a negro the property of a Mrs  Cox  in  Maryland  North America and quote one singular anecdote as it is related by Dr  Rush  of  Philadelphia  in a letter to a gentleman at Manchester  "Being travelling" says the Doctor "with some other gentlemen of this city through Maryland and having heard of the astonishing powers of memory in arithmetical calculation possessed by Thomas Fuller a negro we sent for him when one of the gentlemen in company asked him how many seconds a man of seventy years some odd months weeks and days had lived He told the exact number in a minute and a half  When the gentleman who had asked the question took his pen and having calculated the same by figures told the negro he must be mistaken as the number he had mentioned was certainly too great 'Top Massera' said the negro 'you have omitted the leapyears' when having calculated the seconds contained in the number of leapyears and added them the number was found exactly the same as that calculated by the negro This same man multiplied nine figures by nine by memory before another company"  Another lately repeated the  Alcoran  from recollection onlyWhat amazing mental faculties in African negroes who could neither read nor write Yet that such things are is well authenticated  To what I have already advanced I may add that all negroes firmly believe the being of a  God  upon whose goodness they rely and whose power they adore while they have no fear of death and never taste food without offering a libation In the rivers  Gambia  and  Senegal  they are mostly Mahometans but generally the worship and religious ceremonies of the Africans vary as do the numberless superstitious practices of all savages and indeed of too many Europeans Perceiving that it was their custom to bring their offerings to the wild cottontree  This tree grows to a considerable height and thickness very straight and covered with a strong grey prickly bark The boughs spread very much with small digitated leaves The cotton which it produces triennally is neither white nor plentiful which makes it little sought after It bears some resemblance to the British oak the largest of which it surpasses both in elegance and magnitude    I enquired of an old negro why they paid such particular reverence and veneration to this growing piece of timber  "This proceeds said he massera from the following cause having no churches nor places built for public worship as you have on the Coast of Guinea and this tree being the largest and most beautiful growing there our people assembling under its branches when they are going to be instructed are defended by it from the heavy rains and scorching sun Under this tree our gadoman or priest delivers his lectures and for this reason our common people have so much veneration for it that they will not cut it down upon any account whatever"  No people can be more superstitious than the generality of negroes and their  Locomen  or pretended prophets find their interest in encouraging this superstition by selling them  obias  or amulets as I have already mentioned and as some hypocrites sell absolution in Europe for a comfortable living These people have also amongst them a kind of  Sibyls  who deal in oracles these sage matrons dancing and whirling round in the middle of an assembly with amazing rapidity until they foam at the mouth and drop down as convulsed Whatever the prophetess orders to be done during this paroxism is most sacredly performed by the surrounding multitude which renders these meetings extremely dangerous as she frequently enjoins them to murder their masters or desert to the woods upon which account this scene of excessive fanaticism is forbidden by law in the colony of Surinam  upon pain of the most rigorous punishment yet it is often practised in private places and is very common amongst the Owca and Seramica negroes where captains Fredericy and Van Geurick told me they had seen it performed It is here called the  wintyplay  or the dance of the mermaid and has existed from time immemorial as even the classic authors make frequent mention of this extraordinary practice  Virgil  in his sixth book makes Eneas visit the Sibyl of Cuma and  Ovid  also mentions the same subject lib where Eneas wishes to visit the ghost of his father  But what is still more strange these unaccountable women by their voice know how to charm the  ammodytes  This creature is from three to five feet long and perfectly harmless it has not the least apprehension of being hurt  even  by man while the unparalleled brilliancy of its colours may be another inducement for the adoration of the negroes  or  papaw  serpent down from the tree This is an absolute fact nor is this snake ever killed or hurt by the negroes who on the contrary esteem it as their friend and guardian and are happy to see it enter their huts When these sibyls have charmed or conjured down the ammodytes serpent from the tree it is common to see this reptile twine and wreathe about their arms neck and breast as if the creature took delight in hearing her voice while the woman strokes and caresses it with her hand The sacred writers speak of the charming of adders and serpents in many places which I mention  only to prove the antiquity of the practice  See the th Psalm ver and  "They are like the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear which will not hearken to the voice of charmers charming never so wisely"  Jerem chap viii ver and the Book of Ecclesiastes chap x ver c  for nothing is more notorious than that the Eastern Indians will rid the houses of the most venomous snakes by charming them with the sound of a flute which calls them out of their holes And it is not many years since an Italian woman brought over three tame snakes which crawled about her neck and arms they were four or five feet long but not venomous  Another instance of superstition amongst the negroes I must relate there is a direct prohibition in every family handed down from father to son against the eating of some one kind of animal food which they call  treff  this may be either fowl fish or quadruped but whatever it is no negro will touch it though I have seen some good Catholics eat roastbeef in Lent and a religious Jew devouring a slice from a fat flitch of bacon  However ridiculous some of the above rites may appear yet amongst the African blacks they are certainly necessary to keep the rabble in subjection and their  gadomen  or priests know this as well as the infallible Pontiff of the Roman church These illiterate mortals differ however in this respect from the modern Europeans that whatever they believe they do it firmly and are never staggered by the doubts of scepticism nor troubled with  the qualms of conscience but whether they are upon this account better or worse I will not pretend to determine I however think that they are a happy people and possess so much friendship for one another that they need not be told to "love their neighbour as themselves" since the poorest negro having only an egg scorns to eat it alone but were a dozen present and every one a stranger he would cut or break it into just as many shares or were there one single dram of rum he would divide it among the same number this is not done however until a few drops are first sprinkled on the ground as an oblation to the godsApproach then here thou canting hypocrite and take an example from thy illiterate sable brother From what I sometimes throw out however let it not be understood that I am an enemy to religious worshipGod forbid But I ever will profess myself the greatest friend to those whose actions best correspond with their doctrine which I am sorry to say is too seldom the case amongst those nations who pretend most to civilization  If savage nations be commonly generous and faithful they are not however without their dark shades and among these the most conspicuous is a proneness to anger and revenge I never knew a negro indeed forgive those who had wilfully offended him The strength of this passion can only be equalled by their gratitude for amongst them it may be truly said that  "A generous friendship no cold medium knows  "But with one love with one resentment glows"  Their abominable cruelties also like those of all barbarous nations are truly shocking In the colony of Berbicè during the late revolt they made no scruple of cutting up their mistresses with child even in their master's presence with many other savage devices too dreadful to relate  It is a wellknown fact that a negro having been illtreated by the family in which he lived as a servant one day took the following desperate revenge The master and mistress being from home he having locked all the doors at their return presented himself with their three fine children on the platform on the top of the house When asked why he did not give admittance he only answered by throwing an infant baby to the ground they threatenedhe tossed down the brother they intreated but to no purpose the third sharing the same sate who all lay dead at their parents' feetthen calling out to them that he was now fully revenged leaped down himself and dashed out his own brains amongst the amazed spectatorsAnother stabbed the inoffensive husband to be revenged on the guilty wife declaring that to kill herself was only temporary but to lose all that was dear to her must be eternal bitterness while to himself it was the sweetest satisfaction  In the art of poisoning not even the  Accawaw  Indians are more expert they can carry it under their nails and by only dipping their thumb into a tumbler of water which they offer as a beverage to the object of their revenge they infuse a slow but certain death  After the most scrupulous enquiry and even ocular demonstration I can assert the above as literally true  Whole estates as well as private families have become the victims of their fury and experienced their fatal vengeance even putting to death scores of their own friends and relations with the double view of depriving their  proprietors of their most valuable possessions These monsters are distinguished by the name of  Wissymen  perhaps from  wise  or knowing and by their fatal genius carry destruction to a most dreadful length before they are detected  All barbarous and uneducated people have indistinct notions of property nor can we wonder that slaves who in their own persons suffer the most flagrant violation of every right should be disposed to retaliate The slaves on the plantations are therefore too commonly thieves plundering whatever they can lay their hands upon with impunity nor can any bounds be set to their intemperance especially in drinking I have seen a negro girl empty a chinabowl at one draught containing two bottles of claret which I had given her by way of experiment till she could no more stand  I should not forget to mention that the  Gango  negroes are supposed to be  anthropophagi  or cannibals like the Caribbee Indians instigated by habitual and implacable revenge Amongst the rebels of this tribe after the taking of Boucou some pots were found on the fire with human flesh which one of the officers had the curiosity to taste and declared it was not inferior to some kinds of beef or pork  I have been since assured by a Mr  Vangills  an American that having travelled for a great number of miles inland in Africa he at length came to a place where human legs arms and thighs hung upon wooden shambles  and were exposed to sale like butchers meat in Leadenhall market And Captain  John Keene  formerly of the  Dolphin  cutter but late of the  Naimbana  schooner in the Sierra Leona company's service positively assured me that when he a few years since was on the coast of Africa in the brig  Fame  from Bristol Mr Samuel Biggs owner trading for wood iron and golddust a Captain  Dunnigen  with his whole crew belonging to the  Nassau  schooner which was her tender were cut in pieces salted and  eaten  by the negroes of  Great Drewin  about thirty miles North of the River  St Andrew's  who having torn the copper off her bottom burned the vessel  But from these deformities of character I will now relieve the attention of the reader and proceed in justice to dispel the gloomy cloud by introducing the sunshine of their virtues  Their genius has been already treated of so has their gratitude which last they carry to such a length that they will even die for those who have shewn them any particular favour Nothing can exceed the fidelity and attachment they have for those masters who use them well which proves that their affection is as strong as their hatred Negroes are generally goodnatured particularly the  Coromantyn  and those of  Nago  They are also susceptible of the tender passion and jealousy in their breasts has produced the most dreadful effects The delicacy of these people deserves likewise to be noticed I do not remember amongst the many thousands I have  seen during several years residence among them ever to have observed even an offer to kiss a woman in public Maternal tenderness for their children is also natural to the females for in general during the two years which they usually suckle them they never cohabit with their husbands this they consider as unnatural and prejudicial to the infants and the case of Lesperanza who bore so many children in a short time is no exception as her children died almost as soon as they came into the world The cleanliness of the negro nation is peculiarly remarkable as they bathe above three times a day The  Congo  tribe in particular are so fond of the water that they may not improperly be called amphibious animals  The negroes are likewise spirited and brave patient in adversity meeting death and torture with the most undaunted fortitude Their conduct in the most trying situations approaching even to heroism no negro sighs groans or complains though expiring in the midst of surrounding flames Nor do I remember upon any occasion whatever to have seen an African shed a tear though they beg for mercy with the greatest earnestness when ordered to be flogged for offences which they are conscious deserve to be punished but if they think their punishment unmerited immediate suicide is too often the fatal consequence especially amongst the  Coromantyn  negroes who frequently during the act of flagellation throw back their heads in the neck and  swallow their tongue  which choaks them upon the spot when they drop dead in the presence of their masters But when negroes are sensible of having deserved correction no people can be more humble or bear their unhappy fate with greater resignation The swallowing of the tongue which they only practise during the moments of severe discipline has of late been prevented in Surinam by the  humane  method of holding a firebrand to the victim's mouth which answers the double purpose of burning his face and diverting his attention from the execution of his fatal determination Some have a practice of eating common  earth  by which the stomach is prevented from performing its ordinary functions and thus dispatch themselves without any immediate pain but linger perhaps for a twelvemonth in the most debilitated and shocking condition Against these groundeaters the severest punishments are decreed by the laws but without much effect as they are seldom detected in this act of desperation  After these general remarks upon the mental and bodily faculties of the African negroes we shall next proceed to view them in a state of bondage under all the oppression they are exposed to from the rod of barbarous tyranny then rescuing them from this horrid scene we will next consider them as protected by impartial justice and fostered by the mild hand of tenderness and humanity  The reader may remember that I have already introduced  the slaves as landing from on board the Guinea ships and generally shocking instances of debility and misery  "Their visage is blacker than a coal they are not known in the streets their skin cleaveth to their bones it is withered it is become like a stick"  I have also observed that under the care of some old negroes appointed for that purpose they soon become fat and sleek and learn the language of the colony they then are sent to work in the fields to which they chearfully submit though I have seen some instances of newlyimported negroes refusing to work nor could promises threats rewards nor even blows prevail but these had been  princes  or people of the first rank in their native country who by the casualties of war had the misfortune to become slaves and whose heroic sentiments still preferred instant death to the baseness and miseries of servitude Upon these occasions I have seen the other slaves fall upon their knees and intreat the master to permit them to do the work required in addition to their own tasks which being sometimes granted they continued to shew the same respect for the captive prince that he had been accustomed to receive in his own country I remember once to have had a remarkable goodlooking new negro to attend me whose ancles and wrists being much galled by chains I enquired the cause  "My father" said he "was a king and treacherously murdered  by the sons of a neighbouring prince To revenge his death I daily went a hunting with some men in hopes of retaliating upon his assassins but I had the misfortune to be surprized taken and bound hence these ignoble scars I was afterwards sold to your European countrymen on the coast of Guianaa punishment which was deemed greater than instant death"  The history of Quaco my black boy was still more extraordinary  "My parents" said he "lived by hunting and fishing I was stolen from them very young whilst playing on the sands with two little brothers I was put into a sack and carried for several miles I afterwards became the slave of a king on the coast of Guinea with several hundreds more When our master died the principal part of his slaves were beheaded and buried along with him I with some other children of my age were bestowed as presents to the different captains of his army and the master of a Dutch ship afterwards had me in exchange for a musket and some gunpowder  Each loves his country best if mild its laws or rigid  "The  naked negro  panting at the line  "Boasts of his golden sands and palmy wine  "Basks in the glare or stems the tepid wave  "And thanks his gods for all the good they gave  "Such is the patriot's boast where'er he roam  "His first best country ever is at home"  No sooner do these wretched strangers begin to flag at their labour than whips cowskins bamboos ropes fetters and chains are introduced until they are ready to sink under accumulated oppression With some masters their tasks can never be performed as they must toil on day and night even Sundays not excepted I recollect a strong young negro called  Marquis  who had a wife he loved with two fine children he laboured hard and generally finished his task of digging a trench of five hundred feet by four o'clock in the afternoon that he might have some time to cultivate his little garden and go to fish or fowl to support his beloved family hard did Marquis strive to earn this additional pittance when his  humane  master apprized of his industry for his encouragement informed him that if he could delve five hundred feet by four o'clock he could certainly finish six hundred before sunset and this task the unfortunate young man was condemned from that day ever since to perform  In Surinam the slaves are kept nearly naked and their daily food consists of little more than a few yams and plantains perhaps twice a year they may receive a scanty allowance of saltfish with a few leaves of tobacco which they call  sweetymuffo  and this is all but what is peculiarly provoking to them is that if a negro and his wife have ever so great an attachment for each other the woman if handsome must yield to the loathsome embrace of an adulterous and licentious manager or see her husband cut to pieces for endeavouring to prevent it  This in frequent instances has driven them to distraction and been the cause of many murders  It is in consequence of these complicated evils that so many also destroy themselves by suicide run away to the woods to join their countrymen in rebellion or if they stay grow sad and spiritless and languish under diseases the effects of bad usage such as the  lota  which is a white scorbutic spot that externally covers the body The  crassycrassy  or itch which with us comes from poorness of diet is of course very common with them The  yaws  a most disagreeable disorder by many compared to the venereal disease which renders the patient a shocking spectacle all covered over with yellow ulcers To this lastmentioned loathsome malady most negroes are subject yet but only once in their lives in which and being very infectious it resembles the smallpox indeed if a fly which has been feeding upon the diseased and they are generally covered with them lights upon the slightest scratch on a healthy person it communicates this dreadful disorder which always confines him for several months The most general cure for the yaws in Surinam is salivation and spare diet with continual exercise to promote perspiration and during this process the poor wretches absolutely look like decayed carcases  Still more dreadful is the  boassy  or  leprosy  which is deemed incurable the face and limbs in this complaint swell and the whole body is covered with scales and ulcers the breath stinks the hair falls off the fingers and  toes become putrid and drop away joint after joint The worst of which is that though the disease is hopeless the unhappy sufferer may linger sometimes for many years The lepers are naturally lascivious and the disease being infectious they are of necessity separated from all society and condemned to a perpetual exile in some remote corner of the plantations  The  clabbayaws  or  tubboes  is also a very troublesome and tedious disorder it occasions painful sores about the feet mostly in the soles between the skin and the flesh The usual remedy in this case is to burn out the morbid part with a redhot iron or cut it out with a lancet and then the warm juice of roasted limes is introduced into the wound though with great pain yet with great success  The African negroes are also subject to many species of  worms  both extraneous and internal owing to the wading much in stagnated waters and to the crudity of their diet Of the former species is the  Guinea  or  tapeworm  which breeds between the skin and the flesh and is sometimes two yards in length of a shining silvery colour and not thicker than the second string of a bassviol It occasions dangerous and painful swellings whereever it inserts itself which is mostly about the legs The method of cure is to seize the head of the worm when it appears above the skin and extract it by winding it gently round a stick or card this operation cannot be performed with too much caution for if it breaks the  loss of the limb or even of life itself is frequently the fatal consequence Some are infested with seven or eight of these worms at a time  Besides these dreadful calamities peculiar to themselves the negroes are subject to every complaint common to the Europeans who in their turn are not exempt in Guiana from the afflicting and dangerous distempers I have just described  It is therefore not to be wondered at if many of the plantations are crouded with miserable objects left under the care of the  dressy negro  or black surgeon only whose whole skill consists in administering a dose of salts or spreading a plaister As to the numbers who are excoriated from their neck to their heel by constant whipping they may cure themselves or do their work without a skin if they think proper  Thus from accumulated miseries some naturally succeeding from the climate and their poor diet but more from the inordinate cruelty of  managers  it must follow that numerous slaves become unfit for work many from weakness and depression of spirits and others from extreme labour becoming old before their time But for all these evils this plantation despot finds an infallible remedy which is no other than to put them to death at once the loss does not affect him but his master and he is proud of shewing only such negroes as are able to do their task assuring the owner that they mostly died by  the venereal disease and the word of the human carcasebutcher is quite sufficient as no negro is allowed to give evidence in any case whatever  "Dictio testimonii non est servo homini"  Yet should some fair European by accident prove the murder the delinquent escapes as I have observed by paying a fine of £ and the value of the slave if the owner requires it and for this price of blood he may slaughter the poor wretches whenever a temporary passion or a habit of cruelty which is too commonly generated in this situation prompts his rage  They have moreover many stratagems to evade the penalty should even the magistrates be present I have known it happen when one of these scourges of the human race became tired of a negro that he has taken him out with him a shooting and ordering him to discover the game the first bird that started he has shot the poor man dead upon the spot This was called an accident and no farther enquiry was made concerning it Others have been dispatched by the following methodA stake being fastened in the middle of an open plain the slave is chained to it and exposed to the burning sun where one jill of water and a single plantain is brought him daily until he pines to death But this is not called starving as his master declares that he neither wanted victuals nor drink until he expiredthus he is  honourably  acquitted  Another plan of murdering with impunity has often been put in practice The slave is fastened naked to a tree in the forest with his arms and legs extended under pretence of stretching his limbs but here he is left and regularly fed until he is actually stung to death by the musquitoes and other insectsa most infernal punishment and such as may be with truth ascribed to the instigation of the devil Drowning them by kicking them overboard with a weight chained to their legs is called accidental death It has been known that by the orders of a  woman  negro slaves have been privately burnt to death miserably chained in a surrounding pile of flaming faggots As to the breaking out of their teeth merely for tasting the sugarcane cultivated by themselves slitting up their noses and cutting off their ears from private pique these are accounted mere sport and not worthy to be mentioned  By such inhuman usage this unhappy race of men are sometimes driven to such a height of desperation that to finish their days and be relieved from worse than Egyptian bondage some even have leaped into the caldrons of boiling sugar thus at once depriving the tyrant of his crop and of his servant  From these sketches can it be a matter of surprize that armies of rebels are assembled in the forest and at every opportunity thirsting for revenge  I shall now conclude this dreadful scene by one general  remark shewing how far population is affected by this most infamous treatment  In Surinam there are upon an average about negro slaves as I have stated from which if we subtract children and superannuated men and women there will not be found above really fit for labour There are from six to twelve Guinea ships that import from to slaves each from Africa annually we may therefore compute the yearly importation at an average of necessary to supply and keep complete the above so that the annual deaths exceed the births by the number of though each man negro has a wife or two if he chuses which is upon the mass just  per cent  and consequently proves that the whole race of healthy slaves consisting of are totally extinct once every twenty years  Truth and justice however oblige me to declare that the inhuman barbarities I have been just describing are not universal Compassionate Heaven has ordained some exceptions as I shall impartially shew by reversing the picture not like some writers who have treated this subject and carefully concealed the most pleasing touches of goodness and humanity whilst only the darkest shades have been exposed to the public eye but by candidly exhibiting both sides with equal justice and precision and it is indeed with pleasure I can affirm that the negro slaves on  some  estates are treated in my opinion as  men  ought to be treated and this mode of conduct might still be more general by amending the laws which ought not corruptly to invest human nature with what it is certain to abusean authority completely despotic No master surely ought to be entrusted with the dangerous power of taking away the life of his slaves with impunity and it ought to be considered an equal crime in the eye of the law to kill a negro or a white man as it is equally murder in the sight of God  I shall now introduce to the reader's acquaintance a negro family in that state of tranquil happiness which they always enjoy under a humane and indulgent master The figures in the plate are supposed to be of the  Loango nation  by the marks on the man's body while on his breast may be seen  J G S  in a cypher by which his owner may ascertain his property He carries a basket with small fish and a net upon his head with a large fish in his hand caught by himself in the river His wife who is pregnant is employed in carrying different kinds of fruit spinning a thread of cotton upon her distaff and comfortably smoking her pipe of tobacco Besides all this she has a boy upon her back and another playing by her side Thus under a mild master and an honest overseer a negro's labour is no more than a healthy exercise which ends at the settingsun and the remaining time is his own which he employs in hunting fishing cultivating his garden or making baskets  Family of Negro Slaves from Loango  and fishnets for sale with this money he buys a hog or two sometimes fowls or ducks all which he fattens upon the spontaneous growth of the soil without expence and very little trouble and in the end they afford him considerable profit Thus pleasantly situated he is exempt from every anxiety and pays no taxes but looks up to his master as the only protector of him and his family He adores him not from fear but from a conviction that he is indebted to his goodness for all the comforts he enjoys He breathes in a luxurious warm climate like his own which renders clothes unnecessary and he finds himself more healthy as well as more at his ease by going naked His house he may build after his own fancy The forest affords him every necessary material for the cutting His bed is a hammock or a mat called  papaya  His pots he manufactures himself and his dishes are gourds which grow in his garden He never lives with a wife he does not love exchanging for another the moment either he or she becomes tired though this separation happens less frequently here than divorces do in Europe Besides the regular allowance given him by his master weekly his female friend has the art of making many savoury dishes such as  braf  or a hodgepodge of plantains and yams boiled with salt meat barbacued fish and Cayenne pepper  Tomtom  is a very good pudding composed of the flour of Indian corn boiled with flesh  fowl fish Cayenne pepper and the young pods of the  ocra  or althea plant  Pepperpot  is a dish of boiled fish and capsicum eaten with roasted plantains  Gangotay  is made of dried and  afofoo  of green plantains  Acansa  and  doquenoo  are composed of the flour of maize and the latter is eaten with molasses His common drink is the limpid stream sometimes corrected by a little rum If he is accidentally wounded or indisposed he is cured for nothing but it is very seldom he troubles the faculty being tolerably skilled in herbs and simples besides scarifying and puckering the skin which serves instead of bleeding The inconvenience of vermin he remedies without a comb by plaistering up his hair with clay which being dried on the head and then washed with soap and water makes him clean beyond conception his teeth are constantly kept as white as ivory for this purpose he uses nothing but a sprig of orangetree bitten at one end until the fibres resemble a small brush and no negro male or female is to be seen without this little instrument which has besides the virtue of sweetening the breath  So much for his body and with regard to his  soul  it is seldom troubled with any qualms of conscience or fear of death as I have stated being firm and unshaken in what he was taught to believe which is indeed little but plain and when he is no more his companions or relations carry him to some grove of orangetrees where he  is not interred without expence being generally put in a coffin of the very best wood and workmanship while the cries and lamentations of his surviving friends who sing a dirge pierce the sky The grave being filled up and a green turf neatly spread over it a couple of large gourds are put by the side the one with water the other with boiled fowls pork cassava c as a libation not from a superstitious notion as some believe that he will eat or drink it but as a testimony of that regard which they have for his memory and ashes while some even add the little furniture that he left behind breaking it in pieces over the grave This done every one takes his last farewell speaking to him as if alive and testifying their sorrow at his departure adding that they hope to see him not in  Guinea  as some have written but in that better place where he now enjoys the pleasant company of his parents friends and ancestors when another dismal yell ends the ceremony and all return home Next a fat hog being killed with fowls ducks c a general feast is given by his friends to all the other negroes which concludes not till the following day The nearest connections and relations of the deceased both male and female now cut their hair  We are told Job did the same  and shave their heads round which having tied a dark blue handkerchief they wear this mourning for a whole year after which once more visiting the grave they offer a last libation and taking their final farewell another hog and fowls being killed  the funeral rites are quite ended by a second feast which finishes with a joyful dance and songs in memory and praise of their dear departed friend or relation  No people can more esteem or have a greater friendship for one another than the negro slaves they appear to have unbounded enjoyment in each other's company and are not destitute of social amusements such as the  soesa  which consists in footing opposite to each other and clapping with their hands upon their sides to keep in time So very eager are they at this animating play in which sometimes six or eight couple are engaged at once that the violent exercise having been known to kill some of the negroes it is forbidden by the magistrates at Paramaribo  Awaree  is an innocent amusement consisting in pitching with a large kind of marbles in defect of which they use the awaree nuts or large pebbles  The men also cudgel and wrestle yet at this I think them inferior to either those of Cornwall or Devon Most negroes are strong and active  Witness  Ja' Jackson  the equestrian rider London c  But swimming is their favourite diversion which they practise every day at least twice or thrice promiscuously in groupes of boys and girls like the Indians when both sexes exhibit astonishing feats of courage strength and activity I have not only seen a negro girl beat a hardy youth in swimming across the River Comewina while I was one of the party but on landing challenge him to run a two mile  race and beat him again naked as they were while all ideas of shame on the one side and of insult on the other are totally unknownI shall now say something of their instrumental music and dancing I have already mentioned the singing and the dancing of the  Loango  tribe in particular and will now describe that practised by the other negro nations in general  Their instruments of music which are not a little ingenious are all made by themselves and consist of those represented in the annexed plate where  N  o  which is called  quaqua  is a hard soundingboard elevated on one side like a bootjack on which they beat time as on a drum with two pieces of iron or two bones  N  o  is the  kiembatoetoe  or hollow reed which is blown through the nostrils like the nasal flute of Otaheite it has but two holes one at each end the one serving to sound it the other to be touched by the finger  N  o  is the  Ansokkobaina  which is a hard board supported on both sides like a low seat on which are placed small blocks of different sizes which being struck with two small sticks like a dulcimer give different sounds that are not at all disagreeable  N  o  is the  great Creole drum  being a hollow tree open at one end and covered at the other with a sheepskin on which they sit astride and so beat time with the palms of their hands answering the effect of a bassviol to the  quaqua  board  N  o  is the  great Loango drum  being covered at both ends and serves the same purpose as a bass drum  N  o  is the  Papa drum  beaten as the others  N  o  is the  small Loango drum  beaten together with the great one  N  o  the  small Creole drum  for the same use  N  o  is called  coeroema  this is a wooden cup ingeniously made covered also with a sheepskin and beaten with two small rods or drumsticks after the manner of the  quaqua  board  N  o  is the  Loangobania  This I thought exceedingly curious being a dry board on which are laced and kept down by a transverse bar different sized elastic splinters of the palmtree like pieces of whalebone in such a manner that both ends are elevated by two other bars that are fixed under them and the above apparatus being placed on  N  o  which is a large empty  callebash  to promote the sound the extremities of the splinters are snapt by the singers something in the manner of a pianoforte when the music has a soft and very pleasing effect  N  o  is called by the negroes  sakasaka  being a hollow gourd with a stick and handle fixed through it and filled with small pebbles and pease not unlike the magic shell of the Indians This they hold above their heads and while they dance rattle it to measure  N  o  is a  conch  or seashell which by blowing they  Musical Instruments of the African Negroes  sound for pleasure or to cause an alarm c but is not used as an accompaniment to dancing  N  o  is called  benta  being a branch bent like a bow by means of a slip of dry reed or warimbo which cord when held to the teeth is beaten with a short stick and by being shifted backwards and forwards sounds not unlike a jew'sharp  N  o  is the  Creolebania  this is like a mandoline or guitar being made of a half gourd covered with a sheepskin to which is fixed a very long neck or handle This instrument has but four strings three long and one short which is thick and serves for a bass it is played by the fingers and has a very agreeable sound but more so when accompanied by a song  N  o  is the  trumpet of war  to command advancing retreating c and is called by the negroes the  tootoo  N  o  is a  horn  used to supply the place of the other or on the plantations to call the slaves to work  N  o  is the  Loango tootoo  or flute which they blow as the Europeans do after the common way It has but four holes for the fingers and yet they make it produce a variety of soundsSuch are the musical instruments of our African brethren to which they dance with more spirit than we do to the best band in Europe  To what I have stated I will only add that they always use full or half measure but never triple time in their dancing music which is not unlike that of a baker's  bunt when he separates the flour from the bran sounding  tucketytuck  and  tucketytuck  ad perpetuum To this noise they dance with uncommon pleasure and most times foot it away with great art and dexterity  "Saltantes satiros imitabitur Alphisiboeus"  Every Saturday evening the slaves who are well treated close the week with an entertainment of this kind and generally once a quarter are indulged with a grand ball to which the neighbouring slaves are invited the master often contributing to their happiness by his presence or at least by sending them a present of a few jugs of new rum  At these grand balls the slaves are remarkably neat the women appearing in their best chintz petticoats and many of the men in fine Holland trowsers So indefatigable are they at this diversion that I have known the drums continue beating without intermission from six o'clock on Saturday night till the sun made its appearance on the Monday morning thus had passed sixandthirty hours in dancing cheering hallooing and clapping of hands The negroes dance always in couples the men figuring and footing while the women turn round like a top their petticoats expanding like an umbrella and this they call  waeycotto  During this the bystanding youths fill about the liquor while the girls encourage the performance and wipe the sweat from the brows and sides of the unwearied musicians  It is indeed upon the whole astonishing to see with what goodnature and even goodmanners these dancing societies are kept up of which I repeat it they are so fond that I have known a newlyimported negro for want of a partner figure and foot it for nearly the space of two hours to his shadow against the wall  If to what I have stated relative to negro slaves when under a candid and humane master we further add their never being separated from each other parents seeing their children around them sometimes till the third and fourth generation besides the confidence that they are all provided for to the end of their livesthen if we draw the comparison between this class of people and the numberless wretched objects that disgrace the streets of  Europe  we can assuredly not call those Africans who fall under the above description  unhappy  And now to sum up all I have to say on the subject of slaves in the fewest words for the sake of the reader and also for my own lest I should seem to contradict myself by having so frequently animadverted on the shocking cruelties of some masters and occasionally done justice to the humane and liberal dispositions of others I beg leave to say one word more on the projected  abolition  Could we persuade all our commercial neighbours to join in  that  measure the case would be different but since I have seen cruelties exercised so commonly in Surinam which I never heard of in the British islands and from my certain observation have declared the soil  of that country to be so much more rich and productive than our West Indies shall we not drive our planters from their wornout lands to settle on the more fertile spot under a government which will allow a free importation of negroes while our object if we knew how to compass it is to reduce an unlimited infliction of punishment which indeed our planters have by their own laws most humanely restrained  By a law passed in the council of Jamaica the punishment of a negro is usually limited to twelve lashes but never exceeding thirtynine In Surinam I have known two hundred inflicted on a female and was once the unfortunate occasion of seeing it immediately repeated See Plate XXXV Vol I    Such is indeed the love and confidence of some planters for their slaves that they often entrust their infants to a negro wetnurse in preference to an European where both may be had and such the attachment of some slaves to their masters that I have known many refuse to accept of their emancipation and even some who had their liberty voluntarily return to dependence No one is  perfectly  free in this world all mankind is depending upon one anotherwhile I will beg leave to conclude this laborious chapter by this general remark that all sublunary happiness exists only in imagination and may ever be obtained where health of body and peace of mind are not crushed by  despotic  oppression  CHAP XXVII The Rape of

but without committing any kind of cruelty as too generally had been their custom Upon this intelligence a party of the rangers was instantly detached thither to assist in pursuing them and about this same time the longprojected  cordon  or path of circumvallation round the colony was also began to be cut by seven hundred negro slaves which path was henceforth to be manned with military piquets at proper distances to defend the estates against any farther invasions from without and to prevent desertion to the enemy from within  Mount Parnassus which was the scene of the late  rape of the Sabines  is situated on the west side of the River  Surinam distant from Paramaribo if we include the windings of the river above one hundred miles and as the situation is pleasant I present the reader with a view of it in the plate annexed as also of the village called the  Jews Savannah  which is distant from town in a straight line something more than forty but by water above sixty English miles Here the Jews have a beautiful synagogue and keep their solemn fasts and festivals here they also have their capital schools and seminaries for at this village reside some very respectable Jewish families These people possess particular rights and privileges in this colony with which they were endowed by King Charles the Second when the settlement of Surinam was English and such are these privileges I never knew Jews to possess in any other part of the world whatever  From Paramaribo or rather from the fortress New Amsterdam the River Surinam like those of Cottica and Comawina is beautifully bordered with sugar and coffee plantations as are also several creeks or small rivers that communicate with it such as the  Pawlus  the  Para  the  Cropina  and the  Pararac  creeks but above Mount Parnassus not a single estate that may be so called is to be found neither is the river any longer navigable even for small craft on account of the prodigious rocks and cascades or waterfalls with which it is obstructed as it winds through excessively high mountains and an impenetrable forest While therefore they form an enchantingly romantic scene to the eye these natural bulwarks  View of the Settlement called the Jew's Savannah  View of the Blue Bergh called Mount Parnassus  prevent the possessors of the colony from making such discoveries as might perhaps reward their labour with very considerable riches  If as I have just mentioned cruelties were become less common in the rivers by the rebels barbarities still continued in a shocking degree in the metropolis where my ears were deafened with the clang of the whip and the shrieks of the negroes Among the most eminent of these tyrants was a Miss Spn who lived next door to Mr de Graav and who I saw with horror from my window give orders that a young black woman should be flogged principally across the breasts at which she seemed to enjoy peculiar satisfaction To dissipate the impression this scene had left on my mind I got into a whiskey and rode out when the first thing I saw was a negro girl fall naked from a garret window on a heap of broken bottles this was indeed an accident but she was so mangled though not dead that she exhibited a spectacle nearly as wretched as the otherCursing my unlucky fate I turned the horses and drove to the beach as the only place to avoid every scene of cruelty and misery but here I had the mortification to see two Philadelphia sailors while they were fighting on the forecastle of their vessel both fall over the ship's bow into the stream where they sunk and were no more seen On board another American brig I discovered a little tar defending himself from the crosstrees with a hatchet against a serjeant and four armed men for a considerable time till they threatening  to shoot him out of the rigging he at last surrendered and being brought ashore was dragged to fort Zelandia in company with two others by a file of musketeers where for having been drunk on duty they received a  firecant  each at the captain's request that is they were bastinadoed or beaten on the shoulders by two corporals with bamboo canes till their backs were black and swelled like a cushion However arbitrary this mode of correction the captain endeavoured to explain the necessity of it the private American sailors being of a turbulent spirit indeed when drunk although when sober they may be fairly classed among the best seamen in the world  Early the next morning while musing on all the different dangers and chastisements to which the lower class of people are exposed I heard a crowd pass under my window Curiosity made me start up dress in a hurry and follow them when I discovered three negroes in chains surrounded by a guard going to be executed in the savannah Their undaunted look however averse I may be to the fight of cruelties so attracted my attention as to determine me to see the result which was thusThe sentence being read in Low Dutch which they did not understand one was condemned to be flogged below the gallows and his accomplice to have his head struck off with an ax for having shot a slave who had come to steal plantains on the estate of his mistress The truth however was that this had been done by that lady's absolute command but the murder being  discovered she in the hopes of saving her character besides the expence of paying the penalties gave up her valuable slave and permitted the unhappy man to be thus sacrificed He laid his head upon the block with great indifference stretching out his neck when with one blow of the ax it was severed from his body  The third negro whose name was  Neptune  was no slave but his own master and a carpenter by trade he was young and handsome but having killed the overseer of the estate  Altona  in the Para Creek in consequence of some dispute he  justly  forfeited his life The particulars however are worth relating This man having stolen a sheep to entertain a favourite young woman the overseer who burnt with jealousy had determined to see him hanged to prevent which the negro shot him dead among the sugarcanes for these offences of course he was sentenced to be  broken alive upon the rack  without the benefit of the  coup de grace  or mercystroke Informed of the dreadful sentence he composedly laid himself down on his back on a strong cross on which with arms and legs expanded he was fastened by ropes the executioner also a black man having now with a hatchet chopped off his left hand next took up a heavy iron bar with which by repeated blows he broke his bones to shivers till the marrow blood and splinters flew about the field but the prisoner never uttered a groan nor a sigh The ropes being next unlashed I imagined him dead and felt happy till the magistrates  stirring to depart he writhed himself from the cross when he fell on the grass and damned them all as a set of barbarous rascals at the same time removing his right hand by the help of his teeth he rested his head on part of the timber and asked the bystanders for a pipe of tobacco which was infamously answered by kicking and spitting on him till I with some American seamen thought proper to prevent it He then begged that his head might be chopped off but to no purpose At last seeing no end to his misery he declared  "that though he had deserved death he had not expected to die so many deaths however said he you christians have missed your aim at last and I now care not were I to remain thus one month longer"  After which he sung two extempore songs with a clear voice the subjects of which were to bid adieu to his living friends and to acquaint his deceased relations that in a very little time he should be with them to enjoy their company for ever in a better place This done he calmly entered into conversation with some gentlemen concerning his trial relating every particular with uncommon tranquillity  "But" said he abruptly "by the sun it must be eight o'clock and by any longer discourse I should be sorry to be the cause of your losing your breakfast"  Then casting his eyes on a Jew whose name was  De Vries  "Apropos sir" said he "won't you please to pay me the ten shillings you owe me"    "For what to do"    "To buy meat and drink to be suredon't you perceive I am  The Execution of Breaking on the Rack  to be kept alive"  Which speech on seeing the Jew stare like a fool this mangled wretch accompanied with a loud and hearty laugh Next observing the soldier that stood sentinel over him biting occasionally on a piece of dry bread he asked him  "how it came to pass that he a  white man  should have no meat to eat along with it"    "Because I am not so rich"  answered the soldier  "Then I will make you a present sir" said the negro "first pick my hand that was chopped off clean to the bones next begin to devour my body till you are glutted when you will have both bread and meat as best becomes you"  which piece of humour was followed by a second laugh and thus he continued until I left him which was about three hours after the dreadful execution  Wonderful it is indeed that human nature should be able to endure so much torture which assuredly could only be supported by a mixture of rage contempt pride and the glory of braving his tormentors from whom he was so soon to escape  At Demerary so late as October thirtytwo wretches were executed in three days sixteen of whom suffered in the manner just described with no less fortitude and without uttering one single complaint    Though I never recal to my remembrance without the most painful sensation this horrid scene which must revolt the feelings of all who have one spark of humanity I cannot forbear exhibiting to the public the dreadful spectacle in the annexed drawing If the reader  however should be offended with this shocking exhibition and my dwelling so long on this unpleasant subject let it be some relief to his reflection to consider this punishment not inflicted as a wanton and unprovoked act of cruelty but as the extreme severity of the Surinam laws on a desperate wretch suffering as an example to others for complicated crimes while at the same time it cannot but give me and I hope many others some consolation to reflect that the above barbarous mode of punishment was hitherto never put in practice in the British colonies  I must now relate an incident which as it had a momentary effect on my imagination might have had a lasting one on some who had not investigated the real cause of it and which it gave me no small satisfaction to discover About three in the afternoon walking towards the place of execution with my thoughts full of the affecting scene and the image of the sufferer fresh in my mind the first object I saw was his head at some distance placed on a stake  nodding  to me backwards and forwards as if he had really been alive I instantly stopped short and seeing no person in the savannah nor a breath of wind sufficient to move a leaf or a feather I acknowledge that I was rivetted to the ground where I stood without having the resolution of advancing one step for some time till reflecting that I must be weak indeed not to approach this dead skull and find out the wonderful phaenomenon if possible I boldly walked up and instantly discovered the natural cause by the return of a  vulture  to the gallows  who perched upon it as if he meant to dispute with me for this feast of carrion which bird having already picked out one of the eyes had fled at my first approach and striking the skull with his talons as he took his sudden flight occasioned the motion already described I shall now only add that this poor wretch after living near six hours had been knocked on the head by the commiserating sentinel the marks of whose musket were perfectly visible by a large open fracture in the skull  Vultures  are compared by some to the eagle though those of Surinam possess very opposite qualities They are indeed birds of prey but instead of feeding on what they kill like the other noble animal their chief pursuit is carrion wherefore they generally resort to burialgrounds and places of execution which they discover by their very acute smell so much so that by the negroes they are called  tingeefowlo  or the stinking bird The Guiana vultures are the size of a common turkey they are of a darkgrey colour with black wings and tail the bill is straight with a crooked point and very strong the tongue is cloven the neck without feathers and the legs very short Besides carrion these birds will often destroy and eat serpents and indeed every thing that comes in their way until they are so much gorged that they can hardly fly  The bird called the  king of the vultures  is not very common in Surinam though sometimes the Indians bring one or two to Paramaribo for sale on account of its great  beauty This is larger than any turkeycock with a naked head and neck the skin of which is partly brown yellow and scarlet round its neck it has a dusky long feathered collar in which it can at pleasure withdraw and so far hide its neck that nothing but part of the head is perceptible This bird likewise feeds on carrion serpents rats toads and even excrements  Among the other birds of prey in the forest of Surinam is found the  crested eagle  This is a very fierce bird and also very strong the back is black but yellowish at the base the breast and belly white with black spots as are its thighs and even the feathers of its legs the rest of the body is entirely brown and the claws perfectly yellow The head of this bird is flat ornamented with four feathers two long and two short which it can erect or depress at pleasure  About this time the  Hind  an English frigate with her tender were on the coast looking out for American prizes  The th being the Prince of Orange's birthday the whole corps of officers were entertained with salt beef salt pork barley puddings and hard pease by Colonel Fourgeoud And this day poor Joanna being inflexible in her resolutions I ratified the agreement with the good Mrs Godefroy in presence of her mother and other relations whereby the above lady bound herself  "never to part with her except to myself alone as long as she lived and that upon her death not only her full liberty  but a spot of ground for cultivation besides a neat house built upon it should be her portion for ever to dispose of as she pleased"  After this she returned my remaining bond of florins and gave Joanna a purse with gold containing near twenty ducats besides a couple of pieces of East India chintz advising me at the same time  "to give in a request to the court for little Johnny's immediate manumission which" she observed "was a necessary form whether I should be able to obtain the bail usually required or not and without which formality even if I had the bail ready to appear nothing would be done in the course of business"  Having both of us thanked this most excellent woman I went to sup with the Governor where being transported with joy I gave him my request in full form which he coolly put in his pocket with one hand while he gave me a hearty squeeze with the other and shaking his head told me frankly  "that he would lay it before the court but at the same time was perfectly convinced my boy must die a slave unless I could find the necessary bail which he was at the same time well persuaded very few people would wish to appear for"  Thus after spending so much time and labour besides the expence of above a hundred guineas already paid I had still the inexpressible mortification to see this dear little fellow of whom I was both the father and the master exposed to perhaps eternal servitude as for Joanna she was now perfectly safe to my heartfelt satisfaction  One consolation however in the midst of this disappointment most opportunely presented itself The famous negro  GramanQwacy  formerly mentioned who was just returned from Holland brought the news that partly by  his  interest a new law was there enacted by which all slaves were to be free six months after their landing at the Texel which indeed on application of their masters might be extended to twelve but not a single day longer on any account whatsoeverThus being persuaded that I should  one day  joyfully carry both him and his mother over the Atlantic my heart was greatly relieved  Of this GramanQwacy I will beg leave to give a short account before I take farewell of the reader Suffice it for the present to say that the Prince of Orange besides paying his out and homeward passage and giving him several presents sent him back to Surinam dressed in a suit of blue and scarlet trimmed over with broad gold lace on his hat he wore a white feather and looked upon the whole not unlike one of the Dutch generals which goodness made this king of the negroes however very proud and even frequently very saucy  On the th the Governor of the colony gave a very sumptuous feast to several of his friends at his  indigoplantation  which was situated but a few miles at the back of his palace where I had the honour to be invited as one of the party and had the pleasure of inspecting the  process of making  indigo  a detail of which will probably be acceptable  In the first place therefore I shall present the curious with a drawing of the  indigo plant  which is a knotty shrub produced from seed which grows to about two feet from the ground and comes to perfection in the space of two months This plant requires a very rich soil which besides ought to be kept perfectly clean from weeds In the plate  A  is the colour of the sprig  B  the leaves above  C  the same below  D  the seed inclosed in small brown pods  E  the size of the leaf as it grows  F  a piece of indigo ready made for use The above sprig was designed from nature on the spot but on a small scale it has something the appearance of the tamarind branch principally in the size of the leaf which also grows in pairs and is darker above than below but at the extremity of each shoot in  this  shrub one leaf grows single which is not the case in the other The young shoot in the tamarindtrees also appears at the extremity of the branches but in this they spring forth as may be seen from the base  The mode in which this plant is converted into indigo is as follows When all the verdure is cut off the whole crop is tied in bunches and put into a very large tub with water covered over with very heavy logs of wood by way of pressers thus kept it begins to ferment in less than eighteen hours the water seems to boil and becomes of a violet or garter blue colour extracting all the grain or colouring matter from  the plant in this situation the liquor is drawn off into another tub which is something less when the remaining trash is carefully picked up and thrown away and the very noxious smell of this refuse it is that occasions the peculiar unhealthiness which is always incident to this business Being now in the second tub the mash is agitated by paddles adapted for the purpose till by a skilful maceration all the grain separates from the water the first sinking like mud to the bottom while the latter appears clear and transparent on the surface this water being carefully removed till near the coloured mass the remaining liquor is drawn off into a third tub to let what indigo  it  may contain also settle in the bottom after which the last drops of water here being also removed the sediment or  indigo  is put into proper vessels to dry where being divested of its last remaining moisture and formed into small round and oblong square pieces it is become a beautiful dark blue and fit for exportation The best indigo ought to be light hard and sparkling In Surinam but little of it is cultivated for what reason I know not since one pound is sold for about four florins which is about seven shillings in sterling money  It is said this article was first introduced by one  Destrades  who called himself a French officer and must have brought it from the island of St Domingo very lately since I myself was well acquainted with this poor fellow who since shot himself through the head with a pistol at DemeraryAs the circumstances of his  Sprig of the Indigo Plant  death were somewhat remarkable I cannot resist the temptation of relating them Having involved himself in debt he turned to ready money his remaining effects and fled from Surinam next setting up in the Spanish contraband trade his all was taken Deprived of every thing he now applied for protection to a friend at Demerary who humanely gave him shelter at this time an abscess gathering in his shoulder every assistance was offered but in vain Mr Destrades refusing to let it be even examined his shoulder therefore grew worse and even dangerous but he persisted in not permitting it to be uncovered till one day having dressed himself in his best apparel the family was alarmed by the report of firearms when they found him weltering in his blood with a pistol by his side and then to their surprize having stripped him the mark of  V  for  voleur  or thief was discovered on the very shoulder he had attempted to concealThus ended the life of this poor wretch who had for years at Paramaribo supported the character of a polite and wellbred gentleman where he had indeed been universally respected  Dinner being over at the Governor's indigoplantation I now departed in his excellency's coach to the waterside where a tentbarge and eight oars lay in waiting to row me down to the estate  Catwyk  in the River Comewina whither I was invited by Mr  Goetzee  a Dutch naval officer who was the proprietor of this beautiful countryseat In this charming situation no amusements  were wanting There were carriages saddlehorses sailboats billiardtables c all ready for immediate use But what embittered the pleasure was the inhuman disposition of Mr Goetzee's  lady  who flogged her negro slaves for every little trifle For instance one of the footboys called  Jacky  not having rinsed the glasses according to her mind she ordered him to be whipped the next morning but the unfortunate youth soon put himself beyond the reach of her resentment for having taken farewell of the other negroes on the estate he went up stairs laid himself down upon his  master's  own bed where placing the muzzle of a loaded fowlingpiece in his mouth by the help of his toe he drew the trigger and put an end to his existence A couple of stout negroes were now sent up to see what was the matter who finding the bed all over bespattered with blood and brains got orders to throw the body out of the window to the dogs while the master and mistress were so very much alarmed that they never got the better of it  The above unhappy people were poisoned by their slaves about six years after this happened  nor would any person consent to lie in the same apartment till I chose it in preference to any other being assuredly the most pleasant room and the very best bed in the house What added much to the alarm of the family was the circumstance of a favourite child lying fast asleep in the same apartment where this shocking catastrophe happened They were however relieved from  their alarms on this score by being informed that it had not received the smallest injury  I had not been fourteen days on this plantation when a female mulatto slave called  Yettee  for having jocosely said "her mistress had some debt as well as herself" was stripped stark naked and in a very indecent as well as inhuman manner flogged by two stout negroes before the dwellinghouse door while both her feet were locked to a heavy iron bolt until hardly any skin was left on her thighs or sides Five days after this I had the good fortune however to get her relieved from the ironbolt which was locked across her shins but a Mrs  Van Eys  alledging she had affronted her also by her  saucy  looks prevailed on Mrs Goetzee to renew the punishment the same week when she was actually so cruelly beaten that I expected she could not have survived it  Disgusted with this barbarity I left the estate Catwyk determined never more to return to  it  but I still accompanying Mr Goetzee to visit some of his other plantations from curiosity in Cottica and Pirica Rivers at one of these called the  Alia  a newborn female infant was presented me by way of compliment to give it a name which I called  Charlotte  But the next morning during breakfast seven negroes were here again tied up and flogged some with a  cowskin  which is very terribleHence I made my retreat to the estate  SgravenHague  and there meeting a mulatto youth in chains whose name was  Douglas  I with horror recollected his unhappy father who had  been obliged to leave him a slave and was now dead Heartily tired of my excursion I was now glad to make haste back to Paramaribo where as soon as I arrived the first news I heard was that Colonel Fourgeoud's French valetdechambre poor  Monsieur Laurant  had actually been buried before he was quite deadand that for having been found drunk in an alehouse no less than thirteen of our men had most severely run the gauntlet and as many been terribly bastinadoed the greatest number of which no more saw Europealso that a Quaderoon youth and a Dutch sailor were found murdered on the beach I was now proceeding to take a walk on the plain or esplanade but here I was called in by Mr Stkr who conducting me three stories high "From this window said he a  "few days since leaped one of my black boys to escape a gentle flogging however having only fainted in consequence of his fall we soon brought him to life again by a hearty scouring on the ribs so he did not escape after which for having risked himself that is to say his master's property and frightened my wife she ordered him to be sent to Fort Zelandia where he received the interest that is a most confounded  spansobocko  "  The punishment called  spansobocko  is extremely severe indeed and is executed in the following manner The prisoner's hands being lashed together he is laid down on the ground on one side with his knees thrust between his arms and these confined by a strong stake  which separates them from his wrists and is driven perpendicularly into the ground insomuch that he can no more stir than if he was dead In this locked position trussed like a fowl he is beaten on one side of his breech by a strong negro with a handful of knotty tamarind branches till the very flesh is cut away he is then turned over on the other side where the same dreadful flagellation is inflicted till not a bit of skin is left and the place of execution is dyed with blood after which the raw lacerated wound is immediately washed with lemonjuice and gunpowder to prevent mortification and then he is sent home to recover as well as he can  The above cruel and indecent punishment is sometimes repeated at every street in the town of Paramaribo to men and women indiscriminately which is a severity absolutely beyond conception however it is never  thus  inflicted without a condemnation from the court But a single  spansobocko  without regard to age or sex as I have just mentioned may be ordered by any proprietor either at home or by sending the victim to the fortress with a note to the public executioner to whom some trifle in money is paid as a fee of office  I next was addressed by a Monsieur  Rochetaux  whose Coromantyn cook having spoiled his  ragout  had just cut his own throat to prevent a whipping and Mr Charles  Reynsdorp  's lately did the same  After these facts can it be a matter of surprize that  the negro slaves rise up in rebellion against masters who treat them with so very much severity  As I do not recollect that I have described in what manner these insurgents generally attack the estates I cannot introduce it on a more proper occasion  Having lain during the night lurking in the bushes that surround the estate they always appear a little before daybreak when unexpectedly falling on and massacring the Europeans they plunder the dwellinghouse which they next set on fire and then carry off the negro women whom they load with the spoil and treat with the utmost insolence should they make opposition  For minute particulars I cannot do better than refer the curious to Mr  Belknap  's History of  New Hampshire  where he describes the insurrection of the American Indians which are almost perfectly similar to those of the African negroes    And now farewell I hope ye wretched objects who have not made the least conspicuous figure in these bloody pages for which I should be more ready to apologize to the reader had I not been induced to make cruelty ashamed of itself and humanity gain ground that at last in some measure my motive may be crowned with success I most sincerely wish abhorring every act of barbarity from the very bottom of my soul  "Why  Christians  rage thine insolence and scorn  "Why burst thy vengeance on the wretch forlorn  "The cheerless captive to slow death consign'd  "  Weigh'd down with chains  in prison glooms confin'd  "Of hope bereft  who  by thy minions curs'd  "With hunger famish'd and consum'd with thirst  "Without one friend when Death's last horror stung  "Roll'd the wild eye and gnaw'd the anguish'd tongue"  I have already stated that on the th of August I gave in a hopeless request to the Governor for my boy's emancipation and on the th of October I saw with equal joy and surprize the following advertisement posted up  "That if any one could give in a lawful objection why  John Stedman  a Quaderoon infant the son of Captain Stedman should not be presented with the blessing of freedom such person or persons to appear before January st "  I no sooner read it than I ran with the good news to my good friend Mr Palmer who assured me  "that the above was no more than a form put in practice on the supposition of my producing the bail required which undoubtedly they expected from my having so boldly given in my request to the Governor of the colony"  Without being able to utter one syllable in reply I retired to the company of Joanna who with a smile bid me  "never to despair that Johnny certainly one day would be free"  nor did she ever fail in giving me some consolation whatever desperate were my expectations  About this time we were informed that in the Utrecht paper an impertinent  libel  had appeared against the good  Fourgeoud ridiculing him for his embassy to the  Owca  and  Serameca  negroes which gentleman though he had no assistance from these  allies  to expect and his troops now melted down almost to nothing nevertheless scorned to keep those that could stand upon their feet inactive Thus having provided the few remaining privates with new cloathes the  first  they had received since besides new sabres billhooks c he sent them all once more up accompanied only by the subalterns to be encamped at the mouth of the Cassipore Creek in the upper parts of the Cottica river the staff officers and captains being ordered soon to follow and on the th  we  were treated by our commander for the  first  time with a sirloin of good roastbeef which however was sent him from Amsterdam prepared as I have already described At the dessert was a kind of fruit called in Surinam  pomme de canelle  or cinnamonapple it grows on a shrub in most gardens at Paramaribo and has something the appearance of a young artichoke being covered with a kind of green scales The skin of this fruit is half an inch thick and the pulp like clotted cream mixed with brown sugar it is very sweet but not much esteemed by many palates being rather too luscious the seeds which are black hard and large are contained in the pulp or creamy substance  Having now prepared myself once more for actual service and again received a profusion of wine spirits and refreshments of every kind to carry with me to the  woods from different friends at Paramaribo I left my dear mulatto and her boy to the care of that excellent woman Mrs Godefroy in order the following day to set out on my  seventh  campaign and help if possible to compleat that business we had so long and so ardently undertaken for the safety and welfare of this valuable colony and its  lawful  inhabitants of every denomination while happily my health and my spirits were at this time once more just as vigorous and as strong with all my limbs as perfectly sound as the very first day that I landed with Colonel Fourgeoud and his regiment of marines in  Terra Firma  CHAP XXVIII The Rebels fly for Protection to CayenneThird March to GadoSabyA second Reinforcement of Troops arrive from HollandShipwreck of the Transport Paramaribo March to Rio ComewinaDismal Picture of Distress and of MortalityThe Peace of the Colony restored  CHAP XXVIII  ON the th of November in company with several other gentlemen I now once more set out in a tent barge for the encampment at the  Casseepore  Creek and this day the whole colony was full of smoke the woods having taken fire near the sea fide by some unknown accident On our passage we met Colonel  Texier  who came from the post  Vredenburgh  at the Marawina with a detachment and assured us that since the blow we gave to the rebels at  GadoSaby  they were mostly fled to the other side of that great river where they found refuge amongst the French who were settled in  Cayenne  he had however taken a woman and lieutenant  Keen  took two men and killed two more while the two new black volunteer companies supported the honour of their colours which they had received with so much ceremony from the governor by occasionally bringing in captives from the sea shore behind Paramaribo in which they were assisted by the Indians who had voluntarily fought and defeated the enemy  there more than once Thus every thing promised fair to crown our endeavours with success and finally to reestablish safety and tranquillity in the colony  On our passage we stopped at the estate  Saardan  the proprietor of which by a late marriage was our Lieutenant Colonel  Des Borgnes  I found here an American sailor who came to load molasses and having an inclination to try the skill of the new planter and his overseer in rum I desired the tar to colour a couple of gallons of  killdevil  made at the very same plantation and bring them ashore as rum brought from  Antigua  He did so and they gave him in exchange for it a six gallon keg of the very same spirits declaring it was much better than their own and then drank the contents in punch to my very great entertainment The sailor said he should colour the six gallons also and did not doubt of loading his boat to the water's edge before he reached Paramaribo Such in all countries is the force of prejudice  Having been very well entertained at Saardan we set forward and arrived safe in the encampment at the Casseepore Creek in Cottica River on the th where in stepping ashore being without shoes and stockings I narrowly escaped being bitten by a  landscorpion  This insect is of the size of a small crayfish and has an oval body its colour is like that of soot and it is jointed in moveable rings it has eight legs divided by joints and two jointed claws projecting from the head appearing like part of the body with such small eyes that they are  hardly perceptible the tail is formed by seven globular divisions like beads which terminate in a double sting this it bends over its back to protect its young ones from the attacks of other insects for to the creature's back the young resort after being hatched from eggs like pinheads in a small web spun by the female The sting of the landscorpion is not accounted fatal but occasions a violent pain and throws the patient into a fever it is said they change their skins as crabs do their shells The scorpions generally frequent old trees and old furniture and are often found amongst dry rubbish and faded grass  Almost the first accidents that I saw here was a poor fellow a marine going to bathe in the river who was instantly snapt away by a large  alligator  I no sooner beheld him sink and disappear than having stripped I actually dived after the poor man by the help of a long oar which a negro held perpendicular under water for the purpose constantly taking care to keep all my limbs in motion However I found him not and tugging the oar as a signal to pull it up the fellow by miscomprehension pushed both it and myself down with such violence that we did not rise again to the surface till near the middle of the stream which carried down the oar while I regained the shore by swimming and very great exertion  On the th being now once more ordered to march on discovery to  GadoSaby  I set out at six o'clock in the morning with two subaltern officers three serjeants  seven corporals and fifty privates besides a surgeon and the noted free negro Gousary whom we lost for three or four hours and encamped near the banks of the same creek not having been able to advance above six miles due west from its mouth  On the st we marched north for about seven or eight miles without meeting with one drop of  water  to alleviate our burning thirst it being at this time in the very heart of the dry season which this year was more scorching than I ever remembered it before  Having now changed my course to the northeast and passed the quagmire about noon the following day we marched  dry  through the late fatal marsh and an hour after we kept due west when falling in with a large field of yams we demolished it then proceeding forward I encamped in the old settlement Cofaay almost choked for want of water not having met with any thing like it from the moment we sat out Here however the negro slaves found means to procure us some which though stagnant and stinking like a kennel we drank straining it through our shirtsleeves  During this march I nevertheless took notice of the following trees not yet described  viz  the  canavatepy  and the  berklack  which are extremely fit for domestic use The first is beautifully striped black and brown and has much the appearance of that usually called brazil while it diffuses a smell in working not inferior to that of a carnation The second is a pale red or pink colour and is  equally good for almost every purpose I was this day also presented with a singular kind of fruit called here the  marmalade box  being about the size of a large apple rather oval and all covered over with down This fruit in the beginning is green and when ripe it turns to a brown colour the husk is hard and by a certain motion opens in halves like a walnut when the pulp appears like that of a medlar being a sweet brown substance and adhering to large kernels which the inhabitants suck off with avidity and from this it derives the above name As I took no particular notice of the tree I am sorry not to have it in my power to give any account of it whatsoever  The d I marched east from Cofaay with a view of obtaining some fresh accounts of the rebels and proceeded by a path of communication through cultivated fields but fell in with nothing some delightful views and a large herd of  warree  hogs excepted which from the gnashing of their teeth and their stamping the ground before we saw them we had actually mistaken for a straggling party of the enemy and had consequently freshprimed and prepared to engage them  About noon we returned to  GadoSaby  where sitting down to rest from our fatigue a tall  old rebel negro  appeared suddenly in the very midst of us with a long white beard a white cotton sheet tied about his shoulders and a broken cutlass in his hand Seeing this venerable apparition I instantly started up and forbidding my  people to fire at him I civilly desired him to approach me pledging myself that no person under my command should dare to hurt him but that he should have every thing for his relief that I could affordHe answered "No no massera" with the utmost deliberation and shaking his head in an instant disappeared while two of my men contrary to my orders fired after him at the distance of perhaps six paces only yet both missed their object to my great satisfaction he being a poor forsaken creature that had been left behind the rest gleaning a precarious subsistence from his own deserted fields which we had formerly destroyed What renders the negroes so difficult to hit with a ball is this that they never run straight forward but  zigzag  like the forked lightning in the elements  I now to fulfil my orders once more ransacked Cofaay with its adjoining plains though with a sore heart on account of the poor lonely old rebel Here having cut down several cotton and plantaintrees okeor or althea pigeonpease maize pineapples and some rice most of which had spontaneously sprung up again since our last devastation I could not help leaving before  a little shed  where was some fresh ashes and banana shells a few rusk biscuits and a good piece of salt beef as also a bottle of new rum for the unfortunate solitary old man this being his retreat after which we once more encamped in the fields of Cofaay  Having so frequently mentioned  rice  it may be expected  that I should say something concerning its growth and cultivation It rises to the height of four feet with furrowed stalks and in appearance is not unlike wheat but the stalks are knotted by intervals and stronger the leaves are like those of reeds the seeds are produced somewhat like barley and grow on each side of the spikes or ears alternately The  oryza  or rice is cultivated in a warm and marshy soil the grains are oval and if good ought to be white hard and transparent As for the use of this commodity for food it is so well known that I shall only say that without this grain our poor marines must long ago have all been starved particularly in August when for all allowance they got  per  day  one  rusk biscuit and  three  spikes of maize or Indian corn for  five men  rice alone supplying as I have intimated the rest of the allowance  Having now fully compleated my commission I with my detachment marched back for the Casseepore Creek directing my course through the ruined fields of GadoSaby which were at present choked up to a perfect wilderness Hence we kept first to the southwest and then due south after which we slung our hammocks near a former encampment It is to be observed that at this time all the marshes were nearly dry on account of the hottest season I ever remember while the foetid smell occasioned by the quantities of dead warrapa fish that had been deserted by the water was an intolerable nuisance From amongst these putrid fishes our negro  slaves nevertheless selected the most tolerable which fried in the evening served them for a delicate morsel  The morning following we again marched southwest by west when we slung our hammocks not above four miles from the Cassepore Creek and on the th keeping southsouthwest we arrived in the  grand camp  much fatigued and emaciated myself with a swelled face or erysipelas when I gave in my journal to LieutenantColonel de Borgnes who commanded  See the above route and all the others to  GadoSaby  in Plate LVI where they are by different lines distinctly marked  and I believe upon my honour that had we been ordered to remain twenty years on this expedition with a possibility of saving our lives the different diseases plagues and torments would still have accumulated and varied without end  A detachment of fifty men was next sent out to reconnoitre at Jerusalem c and on the th of December the longexpected  relief  consisting of three hundred and fifty men arrived in the river Surinam from Holland after a voyage of nine weeks and three days of which they spent a fortnight at Plymouth  By these the unfortunate account was brought that Captain  Jochem Meyer  who had on board a considerable sum of money for our troops was taken by the Moors and carried with his crew to  Morocco  where they were condemned to be slaves to the emperor  The above captain and his crew were since set at liberty having been ransomed by the Dutch  and that the  ship  Paramaribo  Captain  Spruyt  being one of the vessels that carried over the sick in the beginning of August was wrecked and entirely lost in the channel on the rocks of  Ushant  but that by the exertions of some French fishingboats the crew and troops had all been saved and carried into Brest whence they had taken a fresh passage for the Texel after which the Prince of Orange who was ever distinguished for benevolence and doing good and humane actions ordered the officers and private men above one hundred in number to receive the following sums by way of defraying their loss  viz  each marine received about four the subalterns thirty the captains forty and Major  Medlar  who commanded fifty pounds sterling However by this shipwreck I lost all my three chests of sweetmeats and pickles besides parrots butterflies monkies c intended as presents to my friends in Europe which indiscriminately went to the bottom to  my  no small mortification  Having now for above a month been lodged in a paltry hut beaten by the wind and showers of rain which began to set in unexpectedly and being informed that notwithstanding the arrival of the relief we were still to stay some time longer in the woods which broke many hearts I on the th of December earnestly set about building for myself a comfortable house and which was finished without either nail or hammer in less than six days though it had two rooms a piazza with rails and a  small kitchen besides a garden in which I sowed in peppercresses the names of Joanna and John while my nextdoor neighbour who was my friend Captain  Bolts  made shift to keep a goat and thus we lived not altogether uncomfortably Others kept hens and ducks but not a  cock  was to be seen in the camp for these having first had all their tongues cut out to prevent their crowing though to no purpose had been since condemned to lose their heads In short our gentlemen built a row of very curious houses indeed all projecting from the beech while on the opposite side above a hundred green huts being constructed to receive the newcome troops the whole together formed no contemptible street though it must be confessed its inhabitants were little better than scarecrows  What was most remarkable in my own habitation however was its entry which was not by the door nor yet by the window but only by the roof where I crept in and out allowing absolutely no other admittance and by this contrivance alone I was effectually guarded from those frequent visitors who smelt my pancakes and used to make too free with my eggs and bacon besides interrupting me while I was drawing writing or reading Upon the whole I must acknowledge that this encampment was agreeable enough more so as being on elevated ground had it not been for the pestilential damps and mephitic vapours that exhale constantly from the earth and had already sent numbers to the other world  During this short space of tranquillity I constructed in miniature my cottage in which I lived at the Hope on an oblong board of about eighteen inches by twelve which being entirely made of the manicoletree and branches like the original was esteemed a masterpiece and this I sent as a present to my friend Mr de Graaff at Paramaribo who since placed it in a cabinet of natural curiosities at Amsterdam As I am upon this subject I am tempted to present the reader with a view of two of my habitations the one that at the Hope where I spent such happy days and the other temporary such as in the woods we constructed to be sheltered from the weatherthe first may be considered as the emblem of domestic felicity the second of rustick hardship and fatigue  The troops of the  Society  of Surinam who had been encamped at the Wana Creek the rainy season prematurely setting in now wisely broke up and on the th passing by us rowed down the river Cottica on their way to the plantations in the Pirica Creek but as for us we were as usual condemned to linger in the Cassipore camp while Fourgeoud still kept snug at Paramaribo With the above officers we received intelligence that a few more rebels had been taken at the Marawina while we ourselves daily continued to send out patroles to the right and left but met with nothing to capture  At last on the th six barges came to an anchor before our encampment with part of the fresh troops that were arrived from Holland for our relief which I could not  Manner of Sleeping c in the Forest  Rural RetreatThe Cottage  help viewing with compassion and not without a cause many of them being already attacked with the scurvy and other loathsome diseases We however sent for bricks and built an oven to bake fresh bread c and did all that was in our power to comfort them having received also a supply of wine for my own use I gave a hearty welcome to all the officers to cheer their spirits but this illfated liquor had an effect far different from what I intended on one of our captains  Pt  by name who from some misunderstanding challenged me to fight him instantly Having retired to some distance from the camp and drawing our sabres he burst out into an immoderate fit of laughter and throwing away his weapon desired me  "to cut away but that for his part he had such a real regard for me that he felt it was impossible for him to make any resistance"  after which catching me in both his arms he gave me so hearty an embrace that he had nearly stifled me and I could not without the greatest difficulty get disentangled Being recovered from my surprize I could not help smiling in my turn and after a friendly reprimand reconducted my valiant opponent to the company where we closed the year with the greatest mirth and conviviality  A confounded tumble through my hammock having ushered in the morning of we went to the commanding officer of the camp to pay him the compliments of the season where I was shown the  philander  or  Mexican oppossum  here called  awaree  which had been just taken alive and with all its young  I have already mentioned the murine oppossum thus shall now only describe such peculiarities as I was able to remark and which were indeed but few in number the animal being in the bottom of an empty hogshead when I saw it its biting preventing me to take it in my hand In the first place it was much larger than the former this being the size of an overgrown Norway rat the colour was a yellowish grey all over and the belly and limbs a dirty white the muzzle was more blunt than that of the murine oppossum with long whiskers its eyes not black but transparent with a black ring round the iris the tail extremely long thick and hairy particularly near the root and its smell was very offensive This oppossum had a pouch under its belly formed by the folding of the skin which is hairy within as well as without from this pouch I saw the young ones five or six in number several times run out when the mother was not disturbed and as often run into it upon the smallest noise or shaking the hogsheadAs I pitied the poor creature after its having been so long tormented I suddenly kicked up the hogshead when the oppossum with all its young escaped and ran swiftly up a very high tree before Colonel Seyburg's cottage and there it hung by the tail to one of the branches but as it is a dreadful destroyer of poultry and the Colonel apprehended that  it would kill every one of his fowls he ordered it to my sorrow to be shot down with all its young onesThe Virginian oppossum I never saw and my only further remark on this shall be that its activity very much surprized me as many writers have denied it this quality For further particulars I refer the reader to the murine or mouse oppossum abovementioned as in most circumstances these two animals perfectly agree  Among the destroyers of poultry there is another animal in this country known by the name of  quacyquacy  some call it the racoon but which properly is the  coatimondi  or Brasilian weasel though many people with some degree of propriety compare it to a fox as it is often able to carry away a goose or a turkey and is also extremely cunning This creature is sometimes near two feet long the body shaped like that of a dog and commonly black or rather dark brown though many are of a bright bay colour the tail is long hairy and annulated with black and a deep buff the breast and belly are a dirty white the head is a light brown with long jaws and a black snout that projects upwards for near two inches and is moveable like that of the tapira the eyes are small the ears are short and rounded while on each side a curved stripe connects them and the muzzle the legs of the coati are short especially the foremost the feet are very long with five toes on each and long claws while the animal like the bear always walks on the heel and stands on those behind No quadrupeds the monkies  not excepted are better climbers on the trees where these creatures commit dreadful ravages amongst birdsnests every small animal which they can conquer becoming their prey In the poultryyards in particular they commit great devastations on which account every contrivance that can be invented is put in practice to destroy them  As I am upon the subject of animals before I leave the woods I must describe another creature which inhabits them and which though more than twice the size of the last lives chiefly on ants this is the  great anteater  or  antbear  called also the  tamanoir  and by the Spaniards the  osa palmera  The body of this animal is covered over with very long shaggy hair on the back and belly it is black and on the neck and sides a grey or yellowish white the head is extremely long and slender Qf a light bay colour with very small eyes the ears are short and round and the mouth which has no teeth just large enough to admit its tongue the tail is of an enormous size with very long black hair something like that of a horse with this extraordinary tail when asleep which is generally in the day time or during a hard shower of rain the animal covers itself like a squirrel at other times he trails it along and sweeps the ground The limbs are slender but covered with long hair the hindmost legs being shortest and black with five claws those before are of a dirty white with but four claws the two middle claws being of an extraordinary length  The Tamandua CoatiMondi  The great anteater is a very bad walker resting always on the heel of his awkward long feet like the coati and bear but he is a better climber and so good a fighter that no dog will hunt him since whatever animal he catches between his fore claws nay even the jaguar or tiger he will not release while he has life His food as I have said consists of ants which he takes in the following mannerwhen he comes to an anthillock he unfolds his slender tongue which is about twenty inches long most exactly resembling a worm this being covered over with a clammy matter or saliva the ants get upon it in great numbers and by drawing it into his mouth he swallows thousands all alive and renews the operation till no more are to be found when he marches in quest of another mountain and in the same manner destroys the unwary inhabitants He also climbs in quest of woodlice and wild honey but should he meet with little success in his devastations he is able to fast a considerable time without the smallest inconvenience It is said that the great antbear is tameable and that then he will pick crumbs of bread and small pieces of flesh also that when killed he affords good food to the Indians and negroes the last of which I have seen devour his flesh with pleasure Some antbears measure from the snout to the tip of the tail no less than eight feetSee the two last described animals in the plate annexed  A small species of antbear called the  tamandua  is also found in Surinam though not very common This  differs from the former in having twenty toes the head being thicker in proportion and the tail smaller which is variegated with bands of black and yellowish white A lesser species still is called the  fourmillier  which however never came within my observationBut to proceed  On the d six more barges with troops came up from Paramaribo which compleated the number of three hundred and fifty men arrived from Holland Amongst these being informed there was a Captain  Charles Small  come from the Scots Brigade this gentleman having exchanged with poor Ensign Macdonald who was sent over sick I instantly sculled down the river alone in a canoe to meet him and offer him my assistance I had no sooner got on board his barge than I found him suspended in a hammock with a burning fever He not knowing me on account of my dress which was no better than that of the most ragged sailor asked me what I wanted but when he saw in me his poor friend  Stedman  changed from a stout sprightly young fellow to a miserable debilitated tatterdemallion he grasped me by the hand without uttering a word and burst into tears which agitation while it increased his illness shewed the goodness of his heart to me more than any thing he could have uttered on the subject  "Dn your blubbering Charles" said I "turn out of this stinking cockleshell I'll presently cure thee"  and getting him hoisted into my canoe I brought him on shore to my own habitation but with  the greatest difficulty being obliged to thrust him through a crevice made on purpose as the hole in the roof was not calculated even for any healthy person's admittance myself excepted Having here slung his hammock near to my own and boiled some water I treated him with warm grog and a toasted biscuit and he became much better from that very moment He now acquainted me that one of his men was drowned on the passage and that Colonel Fourgeoud having entertained the officers with a ball after their landing at which one of his cooks and a couple of meagre marines had been the fidlers he concluded his illness to be the consequence of too much dancing A little after this Colonel Fourgeoud himself appearing in person in the camp amongst us he soon however entertained us with musick of a different kind which was no less than the discouraging news that by the newlyarrived corps of officers several of us had lost our rank both in the regiment and in the army after parching above four years in a burning sun toiling ourselves almost to death and subsisting upon stinking meat and black rusk To add to this grievance while the above gentlemen usurped our preferment we were instead of being relieved ordered to continue in the woods in order to teach them their duty  During the above unpleasing probation the major's duty again fell to my share which was at this time extremely disagreeable being obliged daily to chastise the men many of whom pilfered the magazine to alleviate  hunger having been without the article of bread for  seven  days the oven being dropped to pieces Amongst others one poor fellow was nearly flogged to death for having  borrowed  one of the colonel's Bologna sausages for let it be remembered that our commander in chief whatever might be the distress and hardships of the rest never forgot to support  his own  dignity by at least half a dozen of stout negroes loaded with bacon hams Bologna sausages bullocks tongues tea coffee sugar Madeira wine Holland's gin c  Courage may prompt but ebbing out his strength  Mere unsupported man must yield at length  Shrunk with dry famine and with toils declin'd  The drooping body will desert the mind  But built anew with healthconferring fare  With limbs and soul untam'd  he  tires a war  At length on the th a barge arrived not only with a supply of salt beef and rusk but a bullock and two hogs as a present from Mr  Felman  who accompanied by his lady c came actually on a visit to Fourgeoud in this very strange encampment The above animals being immediately killed they were distributed among four hundred people so that it may well be conceived the shares though sweet were not very large after which the company walked about to view our different habitations Being arrived at my dwelling Fourgeoud led them round and round but seeing no door to get in he called out "Nobody at home" When  I instantly thrust my head through the thatch with a pancake in my hand and offered to haul in the ladies but this they civilly declined I never saw Fourgeoud laugh so much in my life As soon however as he was able to recover his gravity he exclaimed  "  Sacre Dieu Il faut être Stedmanil faut être original comme lui  "  and reconducted the company to his own apartment where he gave me an invitation to follow them Indeed when Captain Small and I went out we generally spent our time in a beautiful savannah where we had erected a green shed to be free in conversation and called it  Ranelagh  here we caroused and cracked a bottle in private till we could crack no longer having lived so well that in a little time more than a week my cheese and bacon hams quite disappeared and not a drop of wine or rum was left in the flasksAfter this he as well as I were obliged to live on short allowance while Small had the satisfaction however to see his shipmates do the same who not being acquainted with the oeconomy necessary in a forest had made all their flour into plumpudding and were already obliged to break their teeth on a piece of rye rusk  In short so early as the th one hundred and fifty of these newlyarrived people were already ordered to march when by the way of seasoning them besides heavy accoutrements and a hammock they had orders each man to carry a stuffed knapsack on his back Of this party my friend Small happened to be one who being as corpulent as  Sir John Falstaff  and I having accoutred him in the above  manner the poor fellow could hardly walk at all till declaring to Fourgeoud that I must roll him along like a hogshead he got leave to be disengaged from a part of his unweildy encumbrances  Every thing being ready this loaded detachment now faced to the right and set out with Colonel Fourgeoud at their head for the river Marawina and while I must here acknowledge that this chief was now become to myself as civil as I could expect or desire yet justice compels me to add that to all others he remained just as inflexible a tyrant as ever I had known him which character he unhappily seemed to think incompatible with his rank  During their absence I crossed the water and cut down a cabbagetree on the other side of the river Cottica not only for the cabbage but for the sake of the  groegroe  worms with which I knew it would swarm in about a fortnight  Straying here through the woods with my black boy Quaco I met with the following trees still left for description  viz  the  cedar  the  brownheart  and the  bullettree  The first though it bears that name is different from the cedars of Lebanon which grow in a pyramidical form The Surinam cedar however grows also to a great height but is principally esteemed because the wood is never eaten by the worms or other insects on account of its great bitterness it has also a most agreeable smell and is therefore used in preference to most others for making chests cupboards lockers and all sorts  of joinery besides which it is employed in making the tentbarges and other boats The colour of the timber is a pale orange it is both hard and light and from the trunk exudes a gum not unlike the gum Arabic which is transparent and diffuses a most agreeable flavour  The  brownheart  is in hardness of the same consistency as the purpleheart and the greenheart already mentioned and is shaped into heavy timber for the same purposes such as constructing sugarmills c the colour of this wood is a beautiful brownThe other is the  bullettree  this tree grows sometimes to sixty feet but is not so thick in proportion as many others the bark is grey and smooth the timber brown variegated or powdered with white specks No wood in the forest is equal to this in weight being heavier than seawater and so very durable that when exposed to the open air neither rain or sun have any effect on it for this reason besides its other various uses it is split into  shingles  to roof the houses instead of slates or tiles which as I formerly mentioned would be too heavy and too hot These shingles are sold for £ sterling a thousand at Paramaribo and continue sometimes twentyfour years before they are renewed  I ought to mention also a kind of mahogany which is found in the woods of Guiana called the  ducollabolla  and which is of a superior quality to any which is imported here being of a deeper red colour and of a finer more equal and compact grain also of greater hardness  and weight and thus capable of receiving a more elegant polish  About this period the whole camp was infested with a kind of  woodlice  so called in Surinam but with more propriety they might be termed white ants resembling them almost in every particular except that the ants dwell in the ground and these build their nests on the trunks of trees these nests being black round and irregular are not unlike the woolly head of a negro but sometimes as large as the half of a hogshead and composed of a rustcoloured incrustated earth which is extremely hard and impenetrable to the weather In this mass which internally consists of innumerable cross roads each the size of a goosequill they live together in myriads whence they sally forth and commit their depredations unequalled by any other insect in Guiana piercing through the hardest wood leather linen or whatever comes in their way They also frequently get into the houses by an incrusted covered road made against the wall resembling the half of a sliding pencil which is with its windings sometimes several hundred feet long if this is not destroyed upon its first appearance which must be done by arsenick or the oil of turpentine as they crumble every thing to dust whole dwellings will be entirely demolished and come down to the ground in rubbish These insects notwithstanding their fetid abominable smell are reckoned a very good food for poultry who are said to thrive on them even better than on Indian  corn I ought not to forget their extreme industry in repairing their habitation when injured and their wonderful power of propagation which let ever such numbers be destroyed brings them in a very short time to their former unaccountable multiplicity  To another pest we were also frequently subjected in this camp and this was no less than clouds of  flying lice  which covered our clothes sometimes so thick that they absolutely gave them the appearance of grey cloth This was owing to the shedding of their wings which being four in number they generally left behind them after they alighted and being thus without the means of flying off again they remained on our jackets except however thus covering us all over they caused us no other inconvenience It is the opinion of some naturalists that these flying lice are no other than the abovementioned woodlice which when they become old get wings leave their nests and fly about like some other ants both in Europe and in America  About this time the discipline was peculiarly strict in the camp so that whoever made the very least noise was most severely punished nay threatened to be shot and even the sentinels were ordered to challenge rounds and patrols by no other sound than  whistling  which was answered in the same manner  On the th one of these being condemned to be flogged for speaking loud I however found means Fourgeoud not being yet returned to get him pardoned after  he was already stripped The following day nevertheless evinced that I could punish when things were carried too far for seeing a large piece of boiled pork about two pounds weight flying past me with great velocity and finding it was thrown by one marine to another while they had got a quarrel I instantly ordered them to pick it up and having cut it in two I stood over them myself till they swallowed every morsel of it in my presence sand and all without either bread or drink which they since declared was such a punishment as surpassed my conception and they should remember it to the end of their lives  On the d I received from town a welltimed supply of wine and fresh provisions and the same day Colonel Fourgeoud with his detachment arrived from the Marawina During this trip our active commander had again discovered and destroyed fiftynine houses besides three fields of provisions This certainly gave the finishing blow to the rebel negroes since having no further supply on this side the water they entirely abandoned it and went to settle in the French colony  Cayenne  In this hard though necessary service the men had suffered prodigiously especially those newly arrived numbers of whom were carried in hammocks on poles while near thirty were left sick at the Marawina and my friend Small was at least one stone lighter  At this time in the camp hospital above one hundred were also dangerously ill Nothing was heard but sighs  and the shrieking of the  strix  or Guiana owl which for ever kept them company during the dismal nights Cramps so common in Surinam also infested those that were able to do duty and there reigned a general melancholy all around  The circling sky  The wide enlivening air is full of fate  And struck by turns in solitary pangs  They fall untended and unmourn'd  Here one man was to be seen covered over with bloody boils from head to foot there another led along by two of his comrades in a deep lethargy who in spite of pinching and pricking dosed into eternity a third swelled by the dropsy and imploring the surgeon in vain to tap off the water who generally answered that it was too late was left to expire by suffocation In the hospital some were observed clasping their hands and praying aloud to God to be relieved while others lay at their side in a frenzy fever tearing their hair blaspheming Providence and cursing the day that they were bornIn short all was dreadful beyond description by the pen of a  Milton  excepted  Sad noisome dark  A lazarhouse it seem'd wherein were laid  Numbers of all diseas'd all maladies  Of ghastly spasm or racking torture qualms  Of heartsick agony all feverous kinds  Convulsions epilepsies fierce catarrhs  Demoniac frenzy moping melancholy  And moonstruck madness pining atrophy  Dropsies and asthmas and jointracking rheums  Dire was the tossing deep the groans despair  Tended the sick busiest from couch to couch  And over them triumphant Death his dart  Shook but delay'd to strike though oft invok'd  With vows as their chief good and final hope  From day to day mortality now gained ground while by some accident to compleat the distress part of the camp got on fire but this was fortunately extinguished without any material ill consequences by the activity and exertions of the poor negroes  On the th  my  misery however drew towards an end when to my astonishment and without my asking it Colonel Fourgeoud gave me a leave of absence if I chose it to accompany him and stay henceforth at Paramaribo which without hesitation I most joyfully accepted Thus having made my friend Captain Small a present of my  house  my  Ranelagh  and all my  fresh provisions  besides entertained him and some other officers on a dish of mountaincabbage and my  groegroe  worms which were just come to perfection besides a hearty glass of wine I took my last adieu from them all and at midnight with Colonel Fourgeoud rowed down the River Cottica in an elegant barge with ten oars in company with two more of his officersAnd now farewell once more ye shady  woods thou pleasing gloomy forest pregnant with so many wonders and so many plagues and which in the opinion of so many sufferers even surpassed the  ten plagues of Egypt  Should it be remarked that during this expedition some unchristianlike expressions have escaped let it be at the same time recollected that while surgeons and even cooks though both of little use had been provided nothing like a  parson  was ever seen amongst us from the day we sailed from the Texel  "I have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of Egypt your young men have I slain with the sword I have made the stink of your camps to come up unto your nostrils yet have ye not returned unto me faith the Lord"  The boat being shoved off Colonel Fourgeoud now declared to us that having ransacked the forest in every direction and driven the rebels over the Marawina in  Cayenne  he was determined no more to return to the woods but in a few weeks to draw the long and painful expedition to a conclusion  Now reader it remains with you to acknowledge that I have not led you  about the bush  but  through it  with indefatigable perseverance the more so when it is to be considered that in the middle of the above hurry and distress under which so many have sunk I have often been deprived of  pen ink  and  paper  to make proper annotations which last defect I have even more than once supplied by writing with a pencil on my cartridges or on a bleached  bone  had this not been unavoidably the case more accuracy and many more remarks might with  justice have been expected which one need never be at a loss to make in a country so replete with different objects for speculation  Having rowed all night and breakfasted at the new cordon which was begun to be cut not far from our former post Devil's Harwar on a dram and a biscuit we came about noon to the estate  Lapaix  where we dined with the planter Monsieur  Rivieres  after which Fourgeoud with his adjutant proceeded on their voyage to town while I with another officer went to the seaside at the back of the plantation to shoot snipes and curlews  On our march thither and back again passing two posts of the Society the flag was hoisted refreshments offered us and every other civility shewn us that was in the power of the commanding officers In shooting however we had very little sport except that of killing some  snipes  which flew in such clouds that they almost darkened the sky so that by only firing from time to time above our heads at random we brought down scores at every shot but they were of such a diminutive species that they were scarcely worth the picking up We might have here killed birds of greater size such as  spoonbills cranes red curlews  and  wild ducks  of many kinds had we not unluckily been cut off from the banks on which they were scattered by the sea overflowing the quicksands betwixt us and them They afforded us nevertheless a most delightful view the beech appearing at a distance like a sheet of scarlet and purple embroidered with every other colour  The Spoon Bill or Shoveler  The Jabiru or Crane of Guiana  The  shoveler  or spoonbill which has some affinity to the cranes is about the size of a goose the legs are not very long and it is webfooted but for a little way between the toes the feathers are a beautiful rosecolour though they are white when young but the bill is truly remarkable in this bird being flat much broader before than at any other part and circular in some degree resembling a spoon from which it takes its name They are said to feed on frogs rats and lizards yet fish is evidently their principal nourishment from their frequenting the seaside and having a fishy taste when they are killed  The  crane  or  jabiru  of Surinam I can best compare to a stork of which it has much the appearance but is larger The body of this bird is milk white but the prime feathers of the wings and tail are black the limbs and toes are excessively long but I observed one peculiarity which distinguishes it from all other birds  viz  that it frequently sits upon the heel the neck and bill are of an uncommon length the latter being strong and a little hooked at the point The head of the crane or jabiru is perfectly black on account of which among the Dutch it obtained the appellation of a  negrocop  It frequents the coast like the others above mentioned and lives entirely on fish this bird is easily tamed I have seen a couple of them in the poultryyard belonging to Colonel FourgeoudSee both these species of seafowls in the  plate annexed  where the last is represented sitting in the posture I have described  To delineate the different species of wild ducks that are in Surinam with any degree of accuracy is a task which I acknowledge to be far beyond my reach Suffice it therefore to say that in general they are not very large but adorned with the most splendid tints and most beautiful plumage that can be imagined particularly those they call the  cawereerkee  the  sookooroorkee  and the  annakee  which last are the smallest No waterfowl of any kind without exception can be more delicate eating than all those I have just mentioned while some of them are tameable and frequently seen amongst the poultry on the plantations  Having the following day the opportunity of a boat I prosecuted my voyage down the Cottica River till I came to Paramaribo where in fine spirits and perfect health however strange I arrived that very same evening and where I was most heartily welcomed by my many friends with the warmest congratulations on my still existing after having escaped so many dangers and been so long deprived of every comforttorn by thorns stung by insectsstarved tormented emaciated and woundedoften without clothes health rest money refreshments medicines or friendsand after having lost so many of my brave companions who lay buried in the dustThus ended my seventh and  last  campaign in the forest of Guiana  CHAP XXIX Some Account of a remarkable NegroThe Troops prepare for EuropeDescription of a Coffee PlantationPlan of Reform for the Increase of Population and universal HappinessOne more Instance of horrid Barbarity and Example of HumanityThe Regiment embarks  BEING now once more arrived in town  CHAP XXIX  and wishing to be no longer troublesome to any body I hired a very neat small house by the waterside in which we lived nearly as happy as we had done at the Hope  The first person that visited me here was the American Captain  Lewis  of the  Peggy  who to my great concern told me that poor  Macdonald  the grateful sailor had died on the homeward passage after being twelve days at sea and desired him in his last words to return me with his good wishes the motherofpearl corkscrew I had formerly given him He farther acquainted me also to my sorrow that three English vessels had been captured by the  American Revenue  privateer sloop which lay at this time with her prizes in the road before Paramaribo one of which belonging to Ireland was valued at above £ sterling  Having been waited on by a number of planters and  others with congratulations on our success against the rebels amongst the rest appeared the celebrated  Gramman Quacy  who came to shew me his fine coat gold medal c which he had received as a present from the Prince of Orange in Holland This man being one of the most extraordinary characters of all the negroes in Surinam or perhaps in the world I cannot proceed without giving some account of him the more so as he has made his appearance once or twice already in the course of this historyThis African for he was born on the coast of Guinea by his insinuating temper and industry not only obtained his freedom from a state of slavery but by his wonderful ingenuity and artful conduct found the means of procuring a very competent subsistence  Having got the name of a  lockoman  or sorcerer among the lower slaves no crime of any consequence was committed especially at the plantations but  Gramman Quacy  which signifies Greatman Quacy was instantly sent for to discover the perpetrators which he so very seldom missed owing in fact to their faith in his sorceries added to his penetrating look  See in Chapter XXV the manner in which I myself discovered a thief  and authority among them that he has often prevented farther mischief to their masters and for these services occasionally received very capital rewards The corps of rangers and all fighting free negroes are under his influence to whom he sells his  obias  or  amulets  in order to make them invulnerable  and of course to engage without fear by which deceit he has most certainly done much good to the colony and at the same time filled his pockets with no inconsiderable profit to himself while his person by the blacks is adored and respected like a God The trash of which his amulets are made costs him in reality nothing being neither more nor less than a collection of small pebbles seashells cut hair fishbones feathers c the whole sewed up together in small packets which are tied with a string of cotton round the neck or some other part of the bodies of his credulous votaries  But besides these and many other artful contrivances he had the good fortune in to find out the valuable root known by the name of  Quaciae bitter  of which he was actually the first discoverer and from which it took its name and notwithstanding this medicine is now less in repute in England than formerly it is highly esteemed in many other parts of the world for its efficacy in strengthening the stomach and restoring the appetite It has besides this valuable property that of being a powerful  febrifuge  and may be successfully used when the bark is nauseated as is frequently the case  In it was made known to  Linnaeus  by Mr  d'Ahlberg  formerly mentioned and the Swedish naturalist has since written a treatise upon it By this drug alone Quacy might have amassed riches were he not entirely abandoned to indolence and dissipation the consequence of which is a complication of loathsome distempers  of which the leprosy is one and that disorder is as I have already stated absolutely incurable Nevertheless his age though he could not exactly ascertain it must have been very great since he used frequently to repeat that he acted as drummer and beat the alarm on his master's estate when the French commodore  Jacques Cassard  put the colony under contribution in the year  Having taken a portrait of this extraordinary man with his grey head of hair and dressed in his blue and scarlet with gold lace I in the annexed plate beg leave to introduce it to the reader  This very same week we had indeed a fresh proof of the good effects of Gramman Quacy's animating obias or amulets a captain of the rangers named  Hannibal  bringing in the barbacued hands of two rebel negroes which he had himself encountered and shot and one of these hands proved to be that of the noted rebel  Cupido  formerly taken in and brought to Colonel Fourgeoud in the forest but from whom he had since that time though loaded with chains found means to run away  In returning the visits of my friends I paid one to Mr  Andrew Reynsdorp  who shewed me the loop and button of his hat which being diamond had cost him two hundred guineassuch is the luxury of Surinam But even this is exceeded by the magnificence of M  d'Ahlbergh  who when I waited on him besides a gold snuffbox set  The celebrated Graman Quary  with brilliants value six hundred pounds sterling made me remark two silver bits small pieces of money set in gold and surrounded with diamonds with this inscription  "Soli Deo Gloria Fortuna beaticum c"  Having signified my surprize at this peculiar attention and respect to two sixpences he declared to me that they were all the money he had in the world when he first came to Surinam from his own country  Sweden  "Did you work"  said I  "No"    "Did you beg"    "No"    "You did not steal sir"    "No but  entre nous  I whined and acted the enthusiast which sometimes is very necessary and I found preferable to the other  three  "  To which I answered  "Sir your candid confession brings back to my remembrance your usage of your negro slave  Baron  after having promised him his manumission in Amsterdam and fully proves what you have just asserted"  One instance more of the extravagance and folly of the inhabitants of this colony and I have done Two of them disputing about a most elegant and expensive carriage that was imported from Holland a lawsuit ensued immediately to determine who was to possess it during which time the coach was left uncovered in the street till it fell to pieces and was totally destroyed  On the th of February most of our officers being now arrived at Paramaribo from the camp Colonel  Fourgeoud entertained the whole with a feast as he was pleased to call it at the headquarters an old stable lanthorn with broken panes of glass hanging over our heads which I expected every moment to drop into the soup And here he acquainted us with evident marks of satisfaction that he had at last put a final end to the expedition having notwithstanding there was so little bloodshed perfectly accomplished his aim in rooting out the rebels by destroying TWENTYONE TOWNS or VILLAGES and demolishing TWO HUNDRED FIELDS with vegetables of every kind on which they depended for subsistence also that the intelligence was now confirmed that the negroes were to a man fled over the River Marawina where they and their friends were settled and protected by the French colony of Cayenne who not only gave them shelter but supplied them with every thing they wanted On which good news we all heartily congratulated him and drank further prosperity to the colony of Surinam with three cheers the future safety of which now depended on the new cordon or path of circumvaliation defended by the troops of the Society and the corps of black soldiers or rangers  In Dr  Firmyn  's works Colonel Fourgeoud and his troops are twice mentioned as the saviours of the colony and by the Abbè  Reynal  they are noticed as a very brave and valiant corps compliments to which they are with truth entitled And what cannot but redound to his honour is that at the time he imposed such hardships  on his own troops he never deliberately put a rebel negro captive to death nor even if he could avoid it delivered them into the hands of justice well knowing that while it was his duty to expel them nothing but the most barbarous usage and tyranny had driven these poor people to this last extremity Indeed I myself whom during the first three years he persecuted with unremitting severity must do him the justice to say that he was indefatigable in doing his duty and that though confused I believe him at bottom to have been an undaunted and very BRAVE OFFICER  He further acquainted us that the vessels with a fresh supply of provisions from Holland had been cast on the leeshore in the Texel Roads one of them having her upper cabin stove away with the second mate and three of her men washed overboard he added however that part of the stores had been saved and loaded on hoard two bilanders which were this very day arrived in the River Surinam And now so much in particular was I become his favourite that he even made me his confidant and declared that he proposed keeping the last arrived troops however fast they were dying away and who had lately lost a man by straying in the woods encamped for many months after our departure He then began to tell me what officers he meant if possible to ruin on their return and which by his recommendation he intended to promote but here I took the liberty to stop him short by declaring upon my honour that those very gentlemen should be apprised by myself of their impending  danger if he persisted in carrying this cruel plan in execution This at least had the effect to end the disagreeable conversation when in my turn I added  "Sir permit me farther to put you in remembrance of these very troops you have just mentioned in regard to their truly distressed situation at the  Casseepore Creek  while their surgeon is gaining gold watches and diamond rings by curing fashionable diseases among the gentry at Paramaribo"  To which he replied  "  Vous êetes un brave garçon  "  and promised to take my hints into consideration  I was now invited once more by Captain Mackneal to spend a few days on his coffee estate Sporksgift but though I was prevented on this occasion from accepting the invitation I will take this opportunity to describe that useful berry which not being a native of Guiana it is said was first planted in Surinam by the Count  de Neale  though others ascribe it to one  Hansbach  a silversmith in  In the coffee berry first came to Constantinople from ArabiaAbout the middle of the th century it was introduced in London and in by Sir  Nicholas Laws  it was planted in the island of Jamaica    The coffeeberry is the produce of an elegant tree which is seldom allowed to grow higher than a man can reach in order to facilitate the gathering of it The bark of this tree is light brown and the leaves like laurel having a beautiful polish with these it is thickly covered  Sprig of the Coffee Tree  the branches diverging from near the surface of the earth to the summit The berries which are oval are first green and gradually change their colour till they are ripe when they acquire a bright crimson hue like that of a cherry In each of these berries are two kernels resembling beans lying flat upon each other Of these a good tree is said to produce three or four pounds weight at each crop for this tree like most other vegetable productions in this luxuriant climate bears two crops every year  To give the curious a better idea of this useful plant I present him with a sprig of it copied from nature in the  annexed plate  in which the figure  A  refers to the wood where it was cut off  B  is the upper side of the leaf  C  the lower side of the same  D  is the berry just beginning to change  E  the same in full perfection being of a beautiful crimson and  F  the kernels or beans as they appear when they are divested of their husk and ready for exportation  The buildings on a coffee estate are first the dwelling house which is usually situated for pleasure near the banks of a river and for convenience adjoining to it are erected the outhouses for the overseer and bookkeeper with storehouses and small offices the other necessary buildings are a carpenter's lodge a dock and boathouse and two capital coffeelodges the one to bruise and separate the pulp from the berries the other to dry them the rest consist of negrohouses a stable hospital  and warehouses which altogether appear like a small village The coffeelodge alone sometimes costs five thousand pounds sterling and sometimes more But to give a more complete idea of the whole apparatus I must refer to the  plate  where all the buildings fields paths gardens floodgates and canals are marked and explained by the necessary references The plan as exhibited in this plate is intended to unite at once elegance convenience and safety It is elegant as being perfectly regular convenient as having every thing at hand and under the planter's own inspection and safe being surrounded by a broad canal which by floodgates lets in the water fresh from the river besides a drawbridge which during the night cuts off all communication from without  I shall now proceed to the plantingground which is divided into large square pieces in each of which are generally two thousand beautiful coffeetrees growing at eight or ten feet distance from each other These trees which begin to bear at about the age of three years are in their prime at six and continue to produce fruit till they are thirty the manner of supplying them being from good nurseries which no coffee estate is ever without having already mentioned that they afford two crops every year which is about Midsummer and Christmas  At the times of harvest it is not unpleasing to see the negroes picking the crimson berries among the polished green where allages and sexes are employed to fulfil their  Plan of a regular Coffee Plantation  task with ardour when the youth who having first filled their baskets wantonly run naked and play amongst the luxuriant foliage  I will now conduct them before the overseer's presence where all the baskets being inspected the flogging commences which is mostly inflicted with impartial severity on all who have not fulfilled their tasks whether from idleness or incapacity This ceremony concluded the berries are carried home into the bruisinglodge and the slaves return home to their houses The berries being bruised in a mill for that purpose in the above lodge to separate the kernels from the husks or pulpy substance they are next steeped in water one night to cleanse them and then spread on the dryingfloor which is exposed to the open air and is constructed of flat stones after which they are spread on garrets made for the purpose to let them evaporate and dry internally during which time they must be turned over every day with wooden shovels this done they are once more dried in large coolers or drawers that run easily on rollers in and out of the windows to prevent them from being overtaken by showers of rain then they are put into wooden mortars and beaten by candlelight with heavy wooden pestles like the rice at GadoSaby to divest them of a thin coat or pellicle that unites the two kernels in the pulp At this exercise the negroes wonderfully keep time and always sing a chorus Being next separated from the chaff through a buntmill once more thoroughly dried on the  coolers and the whole beans picked from the bruised which last are consumed in the colony they are finally put into casks or barrels of about three or four hundred weight each for exportation  I shall only farther observe that in Surinam some coffee plantations produce above pounds weight  per annum  and that as I have already mentioned in the year before our arrival no less was exported to Amsterdam alone than pounds of this valuable article the prices of which have fluctuated from threepence halfpenny to eighteen pence but which calculated at the average price of eightpence halfpenny produces a yearly income of not less than pounds sterling which is no despicable revenue besides what goes to Rotterdam and Zealand  This is sufficient to prove that the cultivation of coffee is highly worthy the attention of the planters and as for the virtues of this excellent berry without entering into particulars I will only refer the reader to that highlyapproved pamphlet entitled  "A Treatise concerning the Properties and Effects of Coffee by  Benjamin Mosely  M D Author of Observations on the Dysentery of the West Indies"  from which I cannot resist the temptation of extracting the following passage  "  Bacon  says coffee comforts the head and heart and helps digestion Doctor  Willis  says being daily drunk it wonderfully clears and enlivens each part of the soul and disperses all the clouds of every function The celebrated  Doctor  Harvey  used it often  Voltaire  lived almost entirely on it and the learned and sedentary of every country have recourse to it to refresh the brain oppressed by study and contemplation"  With the above description I must conclude the observations which I have been able to make on such of the vegetable productions of this colony as have offered themselves to my examination But so abundant is the variety and so extraordinary the properties of the trees plants roots c of this country that by far the greater number are as yet perfectly unknown to the oldest inhabitants of this settlement and to all the world besides  A few years ago a Count  Gentelly  an ingenious nobleman travelled through the desarts of Guiana with some Indians and had acquired considerable knowledge in this his favourite study But alas his labours which promised fair to be of material benefit to the Botanic Society and to mankind in general were interrupted by a fever which owing to his excessive fatigue he caught at the River Correntine and cut him off in the midst of his useful and entertaining researches  Having now concluded my account of the different productions of the colony particularly cotton sugar cacao indigo and coffee to which it is indebted for its riches and having once more repeated that the different trees shrubs plants roots gums and perfumes are equally as innumerable as they are excellent I cannot have a fairer opportunity of fulfilling my promise of  submitting to the reader a few considerations by an attention to which I cannot help thinking that not only Surinam but the West India colonies in general might accumulate wealth to themselves and promote the permanent happiness of the slaves that are under their subjection without having recourse to the  Coast of Guinea  to supply the almost hourly consumption of that unfortunate people But before I proceed it will be necessary to state the manner in which the negro slaves  are  distributed and treated by the customs of this settlement only without adverting to the distribution or government of them in other colonies from which however those may equally derive some profitand then I shall endeavour to point out how in my opinion they  ought  to be distributed and treated according to the laws not only of humanity but of common sense  I have before observed that in Surinam there are supposed to be on an average about negro slaves of all denominations which allowing them for the sake of a round number to amount to are here distributed in the following extraordinary manner  viz  The plantations being about in number though some have but negroes and others we will suppose them to possess slaves each which complement is exactly the above number of people These are employed in this settlement as follows the first column of figures alluding to  one  estate the second ditto to  eight hundred  EMPLOYMENTS     On One Estate  On Estates  Four boys or male servants to attend about the house      Maids or female servants to wash few iron c      A cook for the planter overseer c      A fowler or huntsman to provide game for the table      A fishing negro to provide fish for ditto      A gardener to provide the table and the flower garden      To attend the bullocks and horses on the estate      To attend the sheep on the estate      To attend the hogs on the estate      To attend the poultry that is on the estate      Carpenter negroes to build houses boats c      Cooper negroes to make and repair hogsheads      A mason to build and repair the brick foundations      At Paramaribo some to trades others for shew      A negro surgeon to attend the sick negroes      Sick and incurable that are in the hospitals      A nurse for the negro children that cannot be with their parents      Children under age that can do no work of any kind      Superannuated negroes worn out by slavery      To work in the fields no more than miserable wretches      Total or compleat number of slaves in the colony      By this it appears that no more than or only onefourth of the whole number are condemned to do all the labour of the fields on whom it may be said chiefly falls the dreadful lot of untimely mortality that I have formerly mentioned Now it is evident that if the ablebodied slaves that are in the colony of Surinam were put to equal drudgery the mortality which is now at the rate of five  per cent  would then increase to at least the number of twelve out of every hundred and would compleatly extirpate the whole mass in little more than eight years time  Having thus at an average demonstrated how they are distributed I must briefly observe that while full live better than the common people of England and near are kept in idleness and do no work in the fields the remaining may be classed that is in general among the most miserable wretches on earth and are worked starved insulted and flogged to death without being so much as allowed to complain for redress without being heard in their own defence without receiving common justice on any occasion and thus may be considered as deadalive since cut off from all the common privileges of human society  I will now proceed by candidly asking the world If the above is not an improper and senseless misapplication not only of wealth but of human life and labour which only by a proper distribution and management might accumulate the one and relieve the other  Now would this inconsiderate colony but give up their habits of pride and luxury nay in a moderate degree negroes at least might be added to those now labouring in the fields which providing the whole were treated with less severity must at the same time keep the above superfluous number of idlers employed and by assisting the others in their necessary occupations could not but tend greatly to prevent that shocking mortality to which they are at present exposed by unbounded illusage and barbarity  But every reform must begin at that which is the source of  manners  as well as of  justice  and those therefore who are entrusted with the executive government should have no temptation to overlook the breaches of a  law  while it ought to be a sacred and invariable rule never to allow either the governor or the magistrates of such a colony to be the proprietors of more slaves than merely a limited number to attend on their persons according to their ranks since more than once even to  my  observation it has occurred that those who made and those who were appointed to enforce the laws have been the first that  broke them  for the paltry benefit of causing their negroes to work on a Sunday or to follow the bent of their unbounded passions from which shameful example from the magistrate the contagion must necessarily spread among the individuals  Let the  governor  and principal  magistrates  therefore be sent out from Europe let them be gentlemen of fortune and education and above all men  of liberal minds men that are firm and proof against the allurement of a bribe or the glittering of gold and whose passions are restrained by sentiment and manly feelings Let these men be handsomely rewarded by that nation whom they so materially serve and the colony which they so conspicuously protect but let their salaries be ascertained without depending on the blood and sweat of the miserable Africans Then let such men enact impartial regulations by which the negro slaves are to perform no more than their fair task and labour a reasonable number of hours in the twentyfour let these be followed by protecting laws and let them be no longer racked tormented wantonly murdered or infamously robbed of all that is dear to the human affections their wives and daughters Let regulations be adopted by which they may be properly fed and attended to when sick or indisposed and above all let equal justice be administered suffer them when outraged or plundered to obtain a hearing permit them to complain and enable them to prove by  evidence  the grievances by which they are oppressed Even give them what we so much value ourselves AN INDEPENDANT JUDGE and AN IMPARTIAL JURY nay partly composed of their own sable companions Thus would you have them work and act like  men  first suffer them to be  such  When regulations conform to these shall be adopted and enforced then I venture to say that nations will feel the benefit of their coloniesthen planters will become rich and their overseers become honest then slavery will be little  more than a name and subjects will with pleasure fulfil their limited task then and not till then will population sufficiently encrease for the necessary work and the execrable  Guinea  trade be  totally  abolished which is now too frequently carried on with barbarity and unbounded usurpation Then the master will with pleasure look on his sable subjects as on his children and the principal source of his happiness while the negroes will bless the day their ancestors did first set foot on  American  ground  Having thus according to my opinion pointed out the way and the only way if well considered to redress the grievances of this and many other colonies I would also recommend to  planters  and  overseers  in general to peruse with attention a small work entitled  "Letters to a young Planter or Observations on the Management of a Sugar Plantation to which is added the Planter's Calendar Written on the Island of Grenada by an old Planter"  and published in London in vo price One Shilling and Sixpence and sold by  Strachan  Let them next take an example by that incomparable woman Mrs  Godefroy  by Mr  Thomas Palmer  and a few others who consider their slaves as their fellowcreatures without paying the smallest regard either to their paganism or complexion and who increase both their wealth and their happiness by their humanityI will now once more proceed with my narrative  On the th being invited to dine with his excellency the governor I laid before him my collection of drawings  and remarks on the colony of Surinam which I had the satisfaction to see him honour with the highest approbation I then returned him my thanks not only for the material assistance he had afforded me in completing this work but for the unlimited marks of regard and distinction with which he had treated me from first to last during the whole time I resided in Guiana  Availing myself of his friendship I ventured two days after to give him the following very uncommon  request  praying him to lay it before the court which with a smile on his countenance and a hearty shake by the hand he actually promised me to perform  viz  "I the undersubscribed do pledge my  word of honour  being all I possess in the world besides my pay as  bail  that if my late ardent request to the court for the emancipation of my dear boy JOHNNY STEDMAN be granted the said boy shall never to the end of his life become a charge to the colony of Surinam  Signed "JOHN G STEDMAN"  Paramaribo  Feb    th    Having now done the utmost that lay in  my  power I for several days waited the result with anxiety but without meeting with the smallest hopes of success thus with a broken heart I was obliged at last to give him sweet fellow over for lost or take him with me to Europe which must have been plunging a dagger in the bosom of his mother  While I remained in this situation the transport ships were put in commission on the th for our departure and I myself ordered as one of the commissaries to see them wooded and watered the officers were also cleared their arrears and thirteen men discharged at their own desire to push their fortune at Paramaribo I ought here not to omit that the industrious Colonel Fourgeoud once more paid us all in paper by which as usual we lost ten  per cent  which by letting the Jews have the gold and silver he prudently lodged in his own pocket and while the many hundreds of florins allowed us by government to defray excise duties taxes c were never brought to account or rather we were forbidden to enquire after them at all These were trifles indeed when divided among so many gentlemen but in  one  solid mass they were no contemptible picking  On the st of March a serjeant arrived from the camp at the Casseepore Creek in Rio Cottica where the lastarrived troops were hourly dying away and brought the almost incredible account that the man I mentioned to have been  lost in the woods  on the th of February was actually returned after having been missing  sixandtwenty days  nine of which he subsisted on a few pounds of rusk biscuit and seventeen on nothing at all but water He added that he had entirely lost his voice and was reduced to a perfect skeleton however by the care taken of him by the officers there were still hopes of his life Should  any person hesitate to believe this extraordinary fact let them read  Monsieur Godin  's wellauthenticated letter to his friend  Monsieur de la Condamine  wherein he gives an account of the dreadful sufferings of his lady during her route from  Rio Hamba  to  Laguna  through the woods of South America in October where a delicate woman after being deserted by the Indian guides and after both her brothers had fallen martyrs to their hardships and misery subsisted  ten days  alone in a wild forest without food without knowing where she was and surrounded with tigers serpents and dangers of every description I say let them only read the narrative of this lady's sufferings and their credulity will no longer be staggered at what I myself have related I have indeed even omitted facts which on account of their singularity must in the eyes of some have appeared to border on the marvellous But in the forests of South America such extraordinary realities are to be found that there is assuredly no need to have recourse to fiction or the least exaggeration  Who for instance would believe that almost a whole detachment of eighty marines one day marching through a thick wood imagined to a man that they were stepping one after another over a large fallen tree that obstructed their way till at length it began to move and proved to be no other than a full grown serpent of the  aboma  kind measuring according to Colonel Fourgeoud's computation between  thirty  and  forty  feet in length yet this  is an indubitable truth The above animal was neither killed nor hurt the Colonel ordering the remaining party to form in a half circle and march around it in order that they themselves at the same time might escape every danger from the monster's matchless strength  In this place I shall mention another extraordinary circumstance which is that one morning Colonel Fourgeoud resting in his hammock with one hand carelessly leaning over the side a large  rattlesnake  that lay coiled up among the long grass which was under it was actually severed in two by the sentinel during the very moment of action that it made a spring to bite him of which the soldier whose name was  John Kiefhaber  had been apprised first by the sound of its rattle and next by seeing the snake's head erected while it was brandishing its forked tongue  As I am treating of these reptiles I cannot resist the temptation of inserting a fact which I learned from Mr  Francis Rowe  of Philadelphia a respectable old man who informed me that riding out one morning to visit a friend his horse refused to go forward being terrified at a large rattlesnake that lay across the road Mr Rowe having heard of its power of fascination in which he was a believer alighted to lead the animal round it but during that time the snake having coiled himself up sounded its rattle and stared him so full in the face and with such fire in its eyes that the cold sweat broke out upon him thus whilst he durst neither retreat or advance  he imagined himself gradually rivetted to the spot  "However" continued he "my reason remained and my resolution getting the better of my alarm I suddenly approached him and with one stroke of my cudgel knocked out his brains"  On the d of March my friend de Graaf sailed for Holland but first for St Eustatia where his brother was governor and to my great satisfaction took with him Joanna's youngest brother  Henry  for whom he has since obtained his freedom I sailed with them down the river as far as Bram's Point and wished them a successful voyage As I here went ashore in a fishingboat I was tempted to leap into the sea and enjoy the cooling and healthy pleasure of swimming in the Atlantic ocean The fishermen having caught a quantity of large fish I discovered one among them not yet mentioned in my narrative this was the  yellowback  between two and three feet long thus called from its colour which almost resembles that of a lemon but the belly is white the head is very large with two long barbs but the body is small and without scales like the cod it is however not near so good being coarse and insipid eating Two other small fishes I also saw in the boat the one called here the  weepee  resembling a whiplash he other  waracoo  which is a delicate eating but has nothing in its form or habits deserving a particular description  The th of March being the Prince of Orange's birthday  it was celebrated at the head quarters where after dinner in the court ledge hearing Captain  Bolts  in an undeserved manner censured by the colonel's adjutant for recommending one of the young volunteers of an excellent character but who had no friends to support him  A Mr  Sheffer  already named who had served with honour from first to last on the pay of a private soldier during this painful expedition  I broke through the ring that surrounded them in a passion and not being able to restrain myself publicly reproved the aggressor even in Fourgeoud's presence when a furious altercation and very high words immediately ensued the consequence of which was that next morning at sunrise  we  walked to the savannah without seconds where near the gallows we drew our small swords and after making a few passes at each other Captain Van Geurick's point met my shell which having nearly pierced his blade snapped in two pieces and the fortune of war put him entirely in my power Disdaining however to take a mean advantage I instantly dropped my small sword and desired him to step home and replace his own in order to renew the battle but this proposal he was pleased to call so generous that taking me by the hand he requested a renewal of friendship thus acknowledging we had been too hasty on both sides we went to visit poor Bolts who knew nothing of our morning's walk and was though not without difficulty persuaded also to enter into the amicable treaty by which a second rencounter was happily prevented and a general reconciliation took place  On the th having spent most of the day with the governor I in the evening went on board the ships with Captain Bolts to inspect the preparations for the voyage where we found that the mice and rats had made such havock among our provision with which we were  now  very well stocked that I was under the necessity of procuring half a dozen  cats  to destroy them which useful animals are in Surinam neither so plenty nor so good as in Europe being lazy and indolent on account of the climate I observed they were also smaller and ranker with remarkably long muzzles and sharp ears  The following day I was shocked and surprised beyond the power of expression at seeing a  Miss Jettee de la Mare  daughter to the lately deceased gentleman of that name a lovely mulatto girl aged fourteen who had been christened in and educated as a young lady dragged to court in chains with her mother and a few more of her relations the whole surrounded by a military guard I had almost attempted a rescue when having enquired the cause she called out to me herself weeping most bitterly and informed me that  "she was going to be tried by Mr  Schouten  her mother's master for refusing to perform the work of a common slave which she was utterly unable to perform and could never have expected from the footing upon which she had been educated till that unhappy moment"  By the laws of the country however she was not only obliged to submit but at  his  desire was condemned for disobedience together with her poor mother and all her  relations who had presumed to support her claim to liberty to be privately whipped and had it not been for the humanity of Mr  Wickers  who was at that time the fiscal or town clerk and since was governor this infamous sentence would most certainly have been put in execution The unfortunate Miss Jettee de la Mare was from this period nevertheless forced to submit to the tyranny of her unmanly master while pitied by all her acquaintance and lamented by every stranger that was a witness to the inhuman transaction  Such were the fatal consequences of not having been timely emancipated and such were they indeed that they made me tremble for my little boy Happily my uneasiness was not of long duration for however improbable and unexpected I was surprized on the very same day with a polite message from the governor and the court acquainting me that  "having taken my former services into consideration together with my humanity and gallantry in offering my  honour  as bail to see my child before I left him made a free citizen of the world they had unanimously decreed without farther ceremony or expence to compliment me with a letter which was at the same time officially presented to me containing HIS EMANCIPATION FROM THAT DAY FOR EVER AFTER"  No man could be more suddenly transported from woe to happiness than I was at this moment while his poor mother shed tears for joy and gratitude the more so as we had lost all hopes and the favour came perfectly unexpected  and while near forty beautiful boys and girls were left to perpetual slavery by their parents of my acquaintance and many of them without being so much as once enquired after at all  What is most extraordinary indeed is that while the wellthinking few highly applauded my sensibility many not only blamed but publicly derided me for my paternal affection which was called a weakness a whim So extravagant was my joy on this day however at having acted the reverse part of  Inkle  to  Yarico  that I became like one frantic with pleasure I not only made my will in his favour though God knows I had little to dispose of but I appointed my friends Mr  Robert Gordon  and Mr  James Gourlay  to be my executors and his guardians during my absence in whose hands I left all my papers sealed till I should demand them again or they should be informed of my death I then ordered all my sheep poultry c which had prodigiously encreased to be transported and put under their care and making a new suit of cloaths for the occasion which cost me twenty guineas I waited on a Mr  Snyderhans  one of the clergymen at Paramaribo to appoint a day when my boy my  Johnny Stedman  should be made a Christian  I should not here omit to mention that in colony of Surinam all emancipated slaves are under the following restrictions  viz  They are if males bound to help in defending the settlement against all home and foreign enemies  No emancipated slave male or female can ever go to law at all against their former master or mistress  And finally if any emancipated slave male or female dies in the colony and leaves behind any possessions whatever in that case one quarter of the property also goes to his former owners either male or female    On the th Colonel Fourgeoud's remaining troops at last came down from the encampments at Casseepore Creek and every preparation was made for our departure At the same time the extacy of the few surviving marines at their quitting this country was so great having now also received part of their clearance that such intemperance riot and disorder ensued as produced the most formidable quarrels between them and the troops of the Society till some being wounded and some being flogged peace was finally though with difficulty reestablished  This same day a poor sailor while I was on board was drowned in my presence who fell from the gunwale into the river with the sheet anchor which had been neglected to be lashed to the ringbolts I instantly leaped into a boat to try to save him but could only get his hat the man went to the bottom and never more was seen  The day of our departure now approached fast and I gave up my house when at Mrs Godefroy's pressing invitation I spent the few remaining moments in that which she had prepared for the reception of Joanna and her boy in her beautiful garden charmingly situated under the shade of tamarind and orange trees which house she also had neatly furnished with every accommodation that could be desired besides allowing Joanna a negro woman and a girl to attend on her for life Thus situated how blest should I have been in this spot to end my daysBut fate ordained it otherwise  On the d I made it my business with Captain  Small  who was come down with leave of absence to wait on the Reverend Mr Snyderhans according to appointment but who to both our great surprize peremptorily refused to christen the boy alledging for his reason that as I was going to Holland I could not answer for his  christian  education We replied that he was under two very proper guardians the blacksmith's son for such was this divine persisted and we remonstrated but to no purpose for he was just as deaf as his father's anvil and I believe upon my soul quite as empty as his bellows till at length wearied out with his fanatical impertinence I swore that I would sooner see the boy die a heathen than christened by such a blockhead while my friend Small could not help bestowing on him a hearty curse and slapping the door with a vengeance we departed  Feasting and conviviality now prevailed once more at Paramaribo as on our first arrival Grand dinners suppers and balls were heard of in every quarter But I only visited a few of my select friends amongst which number had constantly been Governor Nepveu and where for the last time I made one of the company at a truly magnificent entertainment which ended the scene of liberality and hospitality for which the inhabitants of Surinam are so justly conspicuous and on the th the baggage was shipped on board the vessels  Numberless indeed were the presents for the voyage with which I in particular was now overstocked from every quarter and my provisions of live cattle poultry  wine rum c c were almost sufficient to carry me round the globe amongst the rest in a small bottle case containing liquors I found a crystal phial filled with essential  oil  of  orange  and a parcel of what they called here  tonquin beans  The first is extracted from the rind or peel of the oranges which is done here by the tedious and laborious method of squeezing it between the finger and thumb A few drops of this on a small piece of sugar is said to be an excellent remedy to strengthen the stomach create an appetite and help digestion and one single drop smells so strong that it is sufficient to perfume a whole apartment The tonquin beans are said to grow in a thick pulp something like a walnut and on a large tree I never saw them otherwise than dried when they bear some resemblance to a prune or dried plumb and are made use of to scent snuff and tobacco to which they impart a most agreeable odour  On the th we took our last leave of his Excellency the Governor  en corps  as assuredly was his due after which all the officers of the Society troops waited on Colonel Fourgeoud at the head quarters to wish us a prosperous voyage to Holland and the day was spent by a regale  en militaire viz  a dinner as usual of salt provisions but I must acknowledge accompanied with as much good liquor of every kind as Surinam could furnish and a very hearty welcome  I believe that now a hundred times Fourgeoud shook me by the hand declaring  "That there was not a young  man he loved better in the world that had he commanded me to march through fire as well as water he was convinced I should never have left it without accomplishing his orders"  with many other fine compliments But I must candidly acknowledge that though I had a heart to  forgive  my mind would never permit me to  forget  the many and unnecessary difficulties and miseries to which I had been too wantonly exposed At the same time he informed me that  he  did not propose to depart with us but intended to follow the regiment very soon with the remains of the lastcome relief when he would render me every service in his power Whatever were his  real  motives for such a sudden change in his disposition towards me suffice it to say that few people at this time were better friends than were the old Colonel  Fourgeoud  and Captain  Stedman  In the evening I went to take a short farewell of my most valuable acquaintances such as Mrs  Godefroy  Mr and Mrs  Demelley  Mr and Mrs  Lolkens  Mr and Mrs  Gordon  Mr  Gourlay  Captain  Mackneal  Doctor  Kissam  c who had all besides Mr  Kennedy  and Mr  de Graaf  now gone to Holland treated me with the most constant and distinguished civility since I had been in the colony but my soul was too full of a  friend  that was still dearer to be impressed with that sensibility on separating from them that it must have felt on another occasion And here I cannot in justice omit remarking that while I gave the most impetuous vent to my feelings not the smallest expression of poignant sorrow or even of dejection  escaped from Joanna's lips while her good sense and fortitude even restrained the tear from starting in my afflicted presence I now once more earnestly pressed her to  accompany  me in which I was seconded by the inestimable Mrs Godefroy and all her friends but she remained equally inflexible and her steady answer was as before  "That dreadful as appeared the fatal separation perhaps never more to meet yet she could not but prefer remaining in Surinam first from a consciousness that with propriety she had not the disposal of herself and secondly from pride wishing in her present condition rather to be one of the first among her own class in America than a reflection or burthen on me in Europe as she was convinced must be the case unless our circumstances became one day more independent"  Here Joanna shewed great emotion but immediately retired to weep in privateWhat could I say or doNot knowing how to answer or sufficiently to admire her firmness and resignation which so greatly exceeded my own I determined if possible to imitate her conduct and calmly to resign myself to my fate preparing for the fatal moment when my heart forebode me we were to pronounce the LAST ADIEU and separate for ever  "Zaïre il est trop vrai que l'honneur me l'ordonne  "Que je vous adorai que je vous abandonne  "Que je renonce a vous que vous le désirer  "Que sous un autre loixZaïre vous pleurer"  The whole corps being ordered at seven o'clock on the morning of the th to wait on Colonel Fourgeoud at the head quarters I tore myself away from all that was dear to me in this world without disturbing them in order to prevent the tender scene of parting He then conducted us to the waterside where the boats lay in waiting and we were immediately embarked under a general salute and colours flying from the fortress and the vessels in the roads The whole corps now having dined on board the staffship with Lieutenant Colonel de Borgnes Colonel Fourgeoud politely invited me to accompany him back to town till next morning but which with a broken heart I thought best to decline He then took his final leave and wishing us all a safe and prosperous voyage to Europe he returned under a salute of nine guns and three cheers with Captain Van Geurike his adjutant back to Paramaribo  On the th of March at midnight the signalgun being fired the two ships got under way and dropped down till before the fortress New Amsterdam where they once more came to an anchor  Here my friends Gordon and Gourlay the guardians of my boy after the convivial Colonel Seyburg for such he certainly was had entertained them on board his vessel the  Hollandia  affectionately coming to visit me they did no less than actually prevail on me to accompany them back to Paramaribo My soul could not resist this second invitation of once more beholding what was so dear to me I went and must I say itfound Joanna who had displayed  so much fortitude in my presence now bathing in tears and scarcely alive so much was she become the victim of melancholy and despair Nor had she partaken of food or sleep since my departure nor spoken to any living creature indeed not stirred from the spot where I had left her on the morning of the th  The ships not being quite ready to go to sea till two days after I was prevailed upon to stay on shore a little longer with poor Joanna and her boy which seemed to chear her But alas too dear we paid for this too short reprieve since but few hours had elapsed when a sailor abruptly came in with the message that the ship's boat lay in waiting that minute to carry me on boardAt that instantHeavens what were my feelings Joanna's mother took the infant from her arms the allworthy Mrs Godefroy supporting herself her brothers and sisters hung around me crying and invoking Heaven aloud for my safety while the unfortunate Joanna now but nineteen gazing on me and holding me by the hand with a look ten thousand times more dejected than  Sterne's Maria  was unable to utter one wordI perceived she was distracted the hour was come I exchanged a ringlet of their hair and fondly pressed them both to my bosomthe power of speech also forsook me and my heart tacitly invoked the protection of Providence to befriend them Joanna now shut her beauteous eyesher lips turned the pale colour of deathshe bowed her head and motionless sunk in the arms of HER ADOPTED MOTHERHere I roused all my remaining  fortitude and leaving them surrounded by every care and attention departed and bid GOD BLESS THEM  The boat still delaying a few moments I now stepped up to poor Fourgeoud surrounded by my friends and grasping his veteran hand I could not for my soul but forgive him all the hardships he had ever occasioned me He was  affected  This was a debt he owed me I wished him every good and finally rowed down the river Surinam  At this time the ships were riding off Bram's Point where Mr  Texier  the deputy governor came on board to wish us a prosperous voyage and after dinner under a salute of seven guns together with Captains Small and Fredericy who had accompanied me hither he returned back to Paramaribo  CHAP XXX The Ships weigh Anchor and put to SeaReview of the TroopsAccount of the VoyageThe Arrival in the Texel Description of the Pampus near AmsterdamFinal

departure both vessels  CHAP XXX  under the command of Lieutenant Colonel  des Borgnes  weighed anchor on the morning of the st of April when with a fresh breeze at E we put to sea and kept course N and N W Motionless and speechless I hung over the ship's stern till the land quite disappeared After some days however by considerable exertions I got the better of my melancholy though not of my affection and my mind became once more composed and calm What chiefly contributed to the restoring of my peace was the comfortable reflection that if I had in some measure injured myself I had at least done good to a few others by relieving three  Joanna Johnny and Quaco  innocent and deserving young people from a state of bondage Yet for this action I was assuredly most amply  rewarded by the preservation of my life principally owing to their unremitting care and attention while such numbers fell all around me and more were ruined in their constitution the victims of the climate and the service some having lost the use of their limbs and some of their memory nay one or two were entirely deprived of their mental faculties and continued in a state of incurable insanity for ever  In short out of the number of near twelve hundred ablebodied men not one hundred returned to their friends and their country and perhaps not twenty amongst these were to be found in perfect health Among the dead were including the surgeons between twenty and thirty officers three of which number were colonels and one a major So very destructive was the service to Europeans in such a climate and such ever must be the result of the most successful operations in the unwholesome atmosphere of woods and marshes  One or two remarks I must make before I conclude this subject which areFirst that among the officers and private men who had formerly been in the West Indies none died while among the whole number of above one thousand privates I can only recollect  one  single marine who escaped from sickness and next that of the few belonging to the corps that were now on their voyage for the Texel those gentlemen alone excepted who at this time belonged to the staff I myself was the  only officer  who had sailed out with the regiment in This last was a  pleasing reflection indeed and which could not but render me sincerely thankful to Providence  About the th of April having passed the Tropicks and changed course to N N E and N E we were becalmed for some days I ought not to omit that when in about degrees N latitude we sailed through what is vulgarly called the  Grass Sea  from its being covered over with a floating kind of green and yellow weed called  gulph weeds  some of which when dried in the sun and spread between two sheets of paper are very curious resembling trees flowers shrubs c and in which are harboured small crustaceous fish scollops muscles and shells of many thousand different species Among the last is often found that wonderful sea reptile called the  hippocampus  or seahorse which I could compare to nothing better than the  chevalier  of a  chessboard  though it is generally larger and sometimes eight or nine inches in length The body is composed of cartilaginous rings the head snout and mane are incrusted all over and the tail which is curvated upwards in the figure of an  S  terminates in a point  On the th the calm still continuing we were daily entertained by swarms of flying fish and several doradoes and grampusses swimming and tumbling before and after the ships as if delighting to keep us company The  grampus  is a fish of the cetaceous kind something resembling the dolphin but much larger and approaching the whale in size some being near twenty feet in length and prodigiously fat This fish has forty strong teeth is of  a dark brown colour and spouts water with considerable force We also saw at some distance from the vessels several times above the water a large  northcaper  This fish which very much resembles the Greenland whale is more dangerous on account of its being more active which proceeds from the body being smaller and flatter than that of the former The jaw is shorter with very small barbs the skin is whiter and the produce of its blubber amounts seldom to more than thirty tons  About the d the weather began to change considerably and the whole ship's company were attacked with a severe cold and cough and many also with the ague  On the th the crew was so weak as to be hardly able to do their duty two of them indeed and one marine were already dead and overboard Colonel de Borgnes was also at this time so much indisposed that the command devolved upon me for a few days during his illness when observing the other ship ahead and almost out of sight I availed myself of my commodoreship by hoisting a flag at the maintop and firing a gun to windward to bring her to which she punctually obeyed  A large  shark  now swimming alongside the ship we did all that lay in our power to take it but to no purpose Sharks are in these seas of different kinds but what is generally called the white shark is the most terrible of its species on account of its size weighing often one thousand pounds and measuring sixteen or eighteen feet in length the head which is something depressed is large  The Shark Remora  it has two spouting holes and prominent eyes which it can turn in every direction and bespeak the malignity of its alldevouring nature nearly under these are its mouth and throat of such an enormous size that it will swallow a bulldog its teeth which are placed in five or six rows are so sharp and strong that they will snap off a man's arm or his leg with ease which has very frequently happened The whole shape of this fish is in every respect like that of the dogfish found in the North Seas with very strong fins one dorsal two ventral and two abdominal the tail is bifurcated the upper part being longest the skin is slimy rough and used for what we call  shagreen  The shark always swims with velocity but must turn upon its side to take its prey by which many fish escape its jaws  The  remora  or suckingfish is frequently found sticking to sharks and to ships bottoms this fish is ashcoloured and long about twenty inches the body roundish and tapering near the tail the fins are placed as those of the shark and the under skin is projecting its  sucker  is however what makes it most remarkable being an oval gristly plate above its head with transverse bars like the palate of a sheep This sucker has so much attraction that no waves however violent can beat it off  For both these fishes see the Plate annexed  The  pilotfish  ought here also to be noticed this is small with brilliant colours and is said not only to feed upon  the gills of the shark but to direct it to its prey from which singularity originates its name  On the st of May being exactly one month at sea during which time by way of making a trial I had continued barefooted and bareheaded without catching cold I this day for the first time not only dressed like my shipmates but wore every thing double and some things triple which I found exceedingly comfortable  About this time a Mr  Neyseus  one of our surgeons having on board a  crabbodago  or  grisson  whose ferocity I have already described to carry home as a curiosity the mischievous creature broke loose and in one night murdered all the monkies parrots poultry and other animals that were upon deck while it drove most of the crew who had the watch down the hatchway till luckily one of them with a handspike knocked out his brains  On the d we had hard gales and heavy showers at S E Latitude about ° From this time the gale daily encreased till the ninth when the weather began to moderate  We now saw several porpoises herringgulls c The first is a fish about five or six feet long excessively fat of a bluish black colour and without scales the head has small eyes and no gills but a long snout and sharp teeth The fins are but one dorsal and two ventral and the tail is horizontal to enable it to leap above the water which it does frequently to blow or breathe at which time its snorting may be heard at a great distance The  flesh of the porpoise when killed is red and looks like some kinds of pork  The  herringgull  is a bird as large as a tame duck perfectly white part of the beak and prime feathers excepted which are of a dark ashcolour the eyes are grey the bill and feet are yellow the claws are black and the length of its wings is between four and five feet from the extremity of the one to the other  On the th in the morningwatch being not far from the  Azores  or Western Isles the vessel was nearly laid on her beamends though then under doublereefed topsails by a sudden squall at E At this time a broken topgallantmast a new handspike c floated past the ship the melancholy remains of a shipwreck which we since were informed to be a Dutch homewardbound East Indiaman that had foundered with all the crew near the island of  Terceira  On the th the wind was violent carrying away our foretopgallantmast and splitting the mainsail while the other vessel lost her bowsprit c and on the evening of the th it blew a perfect storm accompanied with thunder and lightening and very heavy rain which continued during the night and which brought our maintopmast by the board while the ship's crew were so very much reduced as to be hardly able to clear the wreck in which I cheerfully assisted by cutting away with a hatchet  The two following days we continued scudding before  the wind with a reef in the foresail the sea running mountains high and constantly breaking over the vessel pumps going day and night soon after which we saluted the Alarm frigate from Holland which compliment they returned  At length the weather becoming fair we were carried within soundings on the th when we hove the lead in ninety fathom water but the wind shifting to the N E with foul weather we beat about in the chops of the Channel till the morning of the st when at half past one a signal gun was fired for the other vessel that we saw the light off Scilly and at four o'clock P M got the pilot on board  Having been becalmed two days off Dover it was the th before we first saw the Dutch coast here we purchased some excellent fish from a  Schevelin  boat with which we entertained the whole crew though during this sea voyage no ship's company could be better provided  Having kept off shore during the night we at last doubled  Keykduyn  and the  Helder  and on the th at three o'clock P M both ships under a discharge of nine guns dropped anchor in the Texel roads  On the th having passed the small island of  Urk  in the  Zuyder Sea  which is the  only rock  in the province of Holland both vessels running before the wind with a fine breeze  premeditatedly  stuck fast upon the  Pampus  this is a large bank of soft mire covered with shoal water and not far from Amsterdam which it naturally protects  like a barrier from all foreign invaders since all ships whatever must either be lifted over or dragged through this bank of mud  The first is done by sinking two concave vessels called  camels  which being chained together under the bottom of an Indiaman or manofwar of whatever burthen the water is pumped out of them when rising gradually to the surface with their burthen they carry it to where there is to be found sufficient depth to keep it afloat  The second method is practised on smaller vessels and consists of half a dozen sail boats called  watermanakins  towing them through the mud which can never be done but when straight before the wind at which time not only the ship itself but the boats that have her in tow must crowd all the sail they possibly can carry  On the morning of the st having been becalmed all night a fresh breeze at E again sprung up when we fired a gun as a signal and five or six watermanakins instantly came off by the help of which we were dragged over the  Pampus  not at the rate of fourteen knots an hour but at that of fourteen hours a knot since we did not get clear of it in less than three days sailing though not four miles in length however I must confess that the last day we had scarcely any wind at all  During this tedious passage it was no bad entertainment to observe the contrast between some newlyarrived  Norwegians  and us those people sitting upon deck in  their shirts and wiping off the perspiration while we were strutting in great coats and fur caps like so many Muscovites to keep us from the cold  Having at this time received a considerable present of refreshments sent by the city of Amsterdam to the deliverers of their favourite colony and being so near revisiting their old friends and acquaintances all on board were in the highest flow of spirits and exulting with gladnessexcepting  one  from whose mind every happiness was banished  I must here still relate the following singular circumstance A manofwar's boat coming alongside the  Hollandia  the officer and crew no sooner entered on board than one of them without speaking ran up aloft with a knife in his teeth to  cut down the pennant  At this time Lieutenant Colonel Seyburg presenting a musquet and swearing he would shoot him out of the rigging the poor fellow came down by the backstays like a shot to our great entertainment next having explained to him that both vessels had been put in commission by the Prince of Orange the amazed lieutenant made a handsome apology and left the ship  On the d of June every thing being in readiness the troops were put on board six lighters appointed to transport them to  BoisleDuc  in which town they were next to be compleated and do the duty as part of the garrison On leaving the vessels we were once more saluted  with nine guns from each which having returned with three cheers we set sail for the place above mentioned As we passed in the lighters through the inland towns such as  Saardam Haerlem  and  Tergow  I thought them truly magnificent particularly the glass painting in the great church of the latter but their inhabitants who crouded about us from curiosity to see us appeared but a disgusting assemblage of illformed and illdressed rabble so much had my prejudices been changed by living among the Indians and blacks their eyes seemed to resemble those of a pig their complexions were like the colour of foul linen they seemed to have no teeth and to be covered over with rags and dirt This prejudice however was not against these people only but against all Europeans in general when compared to the sparkling eyes ivory teeth shining skin and remarkable cleanliness of those I had left behind me But the most ludicrous circumstance was that during all this we never once considered the truly extraordinary figure that we made ourselves being so much sunburnt and so pale that we were nearly the colour of dried parchment by heat and fatigue and so thin that we looked like moving skeletons to which I may add that having lived so long in the woods we had perfectly the appearance of wild people and I in particular very deservedly obtained the characteristic title of  le Sauvage Anglois  or the English savage  In this state we arrived on the th at the town  of BoisleDuc where the troops were finally disembarked  "Per varios casus tot discrimina rerum  "Pervenimus ad Latium"  "Olim meminisse juvabit"  Thus ended perhaps one of the most extraordinary expeditions that was ever undertaken by European troops and to which only the exploits of the American Buccaneers have any and even that a very distant resemblance  On our arrival I found that Lieutenant Colonel  Westerlo  who went sick to Europe in was not yet quite recovered This gentleman now invited me in company with some others to dine with him at the public mess where while some Dutch officers complained that the soup was smoaky and the beef was tough we adventurers declared that we never had tasted a more delicious repast and at the same time while they praised the strawberries cherries and other European fruits we thought them very indifferent and greatly inferior to the avogadopear the watermelon and the pineapple to which we had been lately accustomedwhich shews that every thing in this world is only good or bad by comparison  The following day we were introduced on the parade to the Lieutenant Governor General  Hardenbrook  and spent the evening at his lady's card assembly where I must acknowledge I was charmed with some very sweet faces fresh as the rose and the lily while they were no less entertained with our grotesque appearance though  we had now borrowed the assistance of powder and pomatum  On the th the troops were finally cleared with and paid their remaining arrears and those who chose it permitted to return to their  former  regiments Some of the privates had from thirty to forty pounds to receive which sailorlike having earned it like horses they spent like asses Among others a young fellow of my company whose late regiment chanced to be quartered in the very same town hired three postchaises to carry him the length of one street only ordering a couple of drunken fiddlers in the first his knapsack in the second and placing himself in the third supported by a brace of the frail sisterhood he was however unfortunately shipwrecked in his course being run foul of by the  major de place  who having broken the fiddles and set the ladies adrift towed the roaring adventurer himself after a hard tug to the quarterguard where he came to an anchor in the bilboes till the gale of his dissipation was quite spent and he had got rid of all his cargo In a similar manner went most of the money which had been earned with so much danger hardship and fatigue  Now came the time to keep my longmade resolution of bidding a  lasting farewell  to Colonel Fourgeoud's regiment from which on the th day of August I obtained my free dismission having requested it immediately after my debarkation from the Prince of Orange who at the same time honoured me with a fresh Captain's  commission in the Honourable General Stuart's regiment which I had left in September while from that date to this very day my full pay had amounted to little more than four hundred and fifty pounds sterling having regularly been stopped out of this sum  ten pounds per annum  for the putrid beef pork ruskbread and hard pease that so miraculously had kept soul and body together  Let me not however be considered as wishing to cast a reflection on the Dutch nation in general who indeed omitted nothing for our preservation and encouragement during this long and painful service a people whose virtues have been for ages as conspicuous as their valour  one  man alone was the cause of all our sufferings  Having now exchanged my blue coat for a scarlet one bought a very handsome horse and put Quaco in a brilliant livery I for the last time entertained my shipmates with whom without exception I drank an everlasting friendship then taking my final farewell of them all I the next morning set out to rejoin the old Scotch regiment where I was received with the strongest marks of joy and unfeigned friendship by the corps  Going now to take my leave of Surinam after all the horrors and cruelties with which I must have hurt both the eye and the heart of the feeling reader I will close the scene with an emblematical picture of  Europe supported by Africa and America  accompanied by an ardent wish that in the friendly manner as they are represented  Europe supported by Africa America  they may henceforth and to all eternity be the props of each other I might have included Asia but this I omitted as having no connection with the present narrative we only differ in colour but are certainly all created by the same Hand Thus if it has not pleased fortune to make us equal in rank and authority let us at least use the superiority we possess with moderation and not only proffer that happiness which we have to bestow on our equals but let us extend it with chearfulness to the lowest of our deserving dependants  On the th of August I repaired to the palace of  Loo  in Guelderland where by the Colonel of the regiment I was introduced to his Serene Highness the  Stadtholder  who not only was pleased to give me a gracious reception remarking that by my looks I must have suffered much but soon after promoted me to the rank of  Major  in the same Scottish regiment  As I had now the pleasure also to see a few others of my fellow sufferers recompensed after their hardships I had reason to think the less of our former troubles thus instead of indulging in censure I found a more solid consolation in the triumph of  truth  which was  brought to light  without my farther interference  "Magna est veritas prevalebit"  On the th of September I went to the Hague where I presented his Serene Highness with  eighteen figures  in wax made by myself for his museum which were most  graciously accepted They represented the free Indians of Guiana and negro slaves of Surinam engaged in different occupations on an island supported by a crystal mirror and ornamented with gold  I now also with  his own consent  made a present of my faithful black boy Quaco to the Countess of  Rosendaal  to whose family I was under very great obligations and who since on account of his honesty and sober conduct not only christened him by the name of  Stedman  at my desire but promoted him to be their butler with a promise to take care of him as long as he lived which was particularly grateful to me being such advantages as I could never have procured for him myself  Here I cannot omit an anecdote of attachment in this boyHaving set out by myself on a short journey I found a crownpiece more than I expected in my purse and for which I was at a loss to account till on my return when I questioned Quaco he said  "that fearing I might be short of cash where people seemed so fond of it he had put his fiveshilling piece in my pocket"  This action was the more generous not only in the manner it was done but being at that time the only crown poor Quaco possessed in this world  About the latter end of October I was offered by the directors of the settlement to be sent over as a lieutenant governor to the colony of  Berbicè  situated next to Surinam In consequence I immediately went to  Amsterdam  to wait on them and hear the proposals in which they  indeed offered me a higher salary and greater advantages than they had ever offered to any other gentleman in that situation but I insisted on having either the  government  if I survived or a decent  pension  after a certain number of years at my return which being out of their power they said to grant I declined accepting of the offer altogether judging it more prudent to recover my health and vigour in Europe with a Scottish company than to parch any longer under the Torrid Zone without a prospect of settling at home with honour and a competent fortune Nor was it long before I perfectly recovered and became as stout and healthy as I had ever been in all my life a happiness of which not one among one hundred of my late shipmates could boast  Among others poor COLONEL FOURGEOUD did not long enjoy his good fortune for he was scarcely arrived in Holland with the remaining few who stayed some time behind us than his beloved  ptisan  having failed him he was one morning found  dead  in his bed attended only by a negro and buried with military honours at the Hague  Not long after this expired also in Surinam Fourgeoud's mortal enemy the GOVERNOR of the colony which vacancy was most worthily filled up by Colonel  Texier  and since by the deserving Mr  Wichers  This gentleman having also resigned I have the pleasure to acquaint my readers that in the year that gallant officer Mr F Fredericy so frequently mentioned in this narrative and who had some time before reentered into the service of the Society troops was appointed Governor of the colony of Surinam    From this period nothing worth recording occurred  till the year when the Emperor of Germany having retaken the barrier towns from the States of Holland General Stuart's regiment was the last that evacuated the city of  Namur  and on the same day the Imperial troops marched in to take possession after which the Emperor ordered in the year all the fortifications to be demolished Soon after this the Scotch brigade the privates of which now consisted of all nations was naturalized by the States of Holland that is formed into three  Dutch  regiments on account of the war with Great Britain and this circumstance induced myself and most of the principal officers immediately to resignas we refused to serve against our King and Country  Having thus left the Dutch service on which day by the Prince of Orange I was complimented with the rank of  lieutenantcolonel  the above gentlemen went to England where in consequence of their loyalty they were taken under his Britannic Majesty's protection and on the th of June eleven of them of which number I was so happy to make one were by General  Conway  introduced at St James's where we had the honour to kiss his Majesty's hand  On the th of the same month the halfpay was voted for them all by the British House of Commons according to the rank in which each individual had  actually served  while abroad  The above gentlemen who were looked upon as being the  real  representatives of his Majesty's Scotch brigade had their loyalty further rewarded by the revival of that old and honourable corps in Britain which was since reembodied under the command of General  Francis Dundas  and sent to garrison  Gibraltar  But that the reader may have  some idea of what is meant by the SCOTCH BRIGADE and of what they formerly consisted I will beg leave to insert the following particulars  "In this ancient corps first landed in Holland as independent companies commanded by some of the first noblemen in Scotland  "In the year their gallant behaviour together with the English at the battle of  Reminat  near  Mechlin  is mentioned particularly by  Strada  "In  Menin  was surprised and the Spanish and Walloon guards taken prisoners by Colonel  Balfour  with his regiment alone  "In at the memorable blockade of  BergenopZoom  by the Prince of  Parma  the Scots under the command of General  Balfour  and Colonel  Scott  made a sortie and demolished the greatest part of the Spanish lines by which the enemy were forced to break up the siege with considerable loss of men and ammunition  "In at the siege of  ZutphenDeventer Nimeguen  and  Hulst  their bravery is well known  "In they shared so much of the glory at the taking of  Gertrudenberg  that both General Balfour and his regiment were highly distinguished by Prince  Maurice  The general he made governor to command the garrison instead of his brother Prince  Henry  and the regiment he appointed as the most spirited corps to defend it  "In at the taking of  Bommel  the Scots suffered most considerably  "In two field officers eight captains with above six hundred private men were left dead on the field after the famous  Battle of the Downs  near Nieuport where both they and the English behaved with the greatest gallantry and to the valour of these united bands was attributed the success of the day  "In at the siege of  Ostend  which lasted three years and at which was levelled the whole power of Spain nothing could equal the valour and courage both of the Scotch and English the first commanded by Generals Balfour and  St Clair  the latter by Lords  Willoughby  and  Vere  who after a great slaughter of the Spaniards including all their best officers forced the assailants to raise the siege and retreat with great shame and confusion  "During the government of the three first Princes of Orange  William Maurice  and  FrederickHenry  the Scotch behaved with so much bravery honour and reputation that by the last prince besides many other marks of distinction which he conferred on them they were called the  bulwarks of the republick  "The necessary limits of this chapter compel me to omit many memorable services which were rendered by this distinguished body of men to the provinces of Holland but I cannot overlook the last siege of BergenopZoom by the French in where while others  shamefully ran away one regiment of Scots in the middle of the town having twice repulsed the enemy fought alone till they were nearly cut to pieces leaving fifteen officers and above five hundred privates on the field"  Such is the history of the late Scotch brigade in the Dutch service and such were the outlines of its military character till the day of its dissolution in  I must now draw this narrative to a conclusion by once more mentioning the name of Joanna and acquaint the reader that alasJOANNA IS NO MORE  In the month of August I received the melancholy tidings from Mr Gourlay which pierced me to the soul that on the fatal  fifth  of  November  this virtuous young woman departed this life as  some  suspected by poison  Her emancipated brother  Henry  underwent the same melancholy fate  administered by the hand of jealousy and envy on account of her prosperity and the marks of distinction which her superior merit had so justly attracted from the respectable part of the colony  But she is no more Reader the virtuous Joanna who so often saved my life is no moreHer adopted mother Mrs Godefroy who bedewed her beauteous body with tears ordered it to be interred with every mark of respect under the grove of orangetrees where she had lived Her lovely boy was sent to me with a bill of near two hundred pounds his private property by inheritance from his motherSoon after which expired both his very faithful guardians  This CHARMING YOUTH having made a most commendable progress in his education in Devon went two West India voyages with the highest character as a sailor and during the  Spanish  troubles served with honour as a midshipman on board his Majesty's ships  Southampton  and  Lizard  ever ready to engage in any service that the advantage of his king and country called forBut Oh he also is no more having since  perished  at sea off the island of  Jamaica  The effect which the following lines had on the sympathetic and ingenious Mrs  Cowley  could alone induce me to intrude them on the Public Let this be my apologyOh more than bitter task  AN  Elegy  ON MY  SAILOR  LOUD sounds the tempestpeals of thunder roar  Tremendous lightnings flash from shore to shore  Seas dash the shaking rocksseas mount the flaming sky  And elements convuls'd speak dissolution nigh  Such scenes as these while tossing on the waves  True to his duty still the manly sailor braves  SUCH WAS MY BOYwhose eyes could never weep  But for his neighbour's woes now swallow'd in the deep  Oh agonizing painpain never felt before  My manly boymy  John  my Sailor is no more  Still let me mourn with hopeand GOD adore  With hope to see my sailor once again  Floating on seas of bliss thro' th' azure main  Till then a short farewell my lovely boy  Thy shipmates darling and thy father's joy  Yet one small comfort soothes while doom'd to part  Dear gallant youth thy parent's broken heart  No more thy tender frame thy blooming age  Shall be the sport of Ocean's turb'lent rage  No more thy  olive  beauties on the waves  Shall be the scorn of some European slaves  Whose optics blind to merit ne'er could spy  That sterling worth could bloom beneath a western sky  No more my dearno morewhile  such were scar'd  UNDAUNTED shalt thou rock upon the yard  There while the silver moon gleam'd thro' the gale  With manly skill and courage hand the fail  When Fame who scann'd the value of her Tar  Did make thee shine on board a manofwar  With honor  Since the above lines were written the last of his commanders the gallant Captain  John Hutt  lost his life in the memorable action fought under Admiral LORD HOWE against the French on the st of June This officer loved my Sailor well nor was he less esteemed by Captain  Richard Keates  from whom he had the honour to receive his first naval education  while with equal glory fir'd  To please a parent brother friend thou e'er aspir'd  Till Deathrelentless Deathnone can withstand  To  cut thy cable  gave the LAST COMMAND  Soar now my angel to thy Maker's shrine  There reap that prize due to such worth as thine  Fly gentle shadefly to that blest abode  There view thy  mother  and adore thy GOD  There Oh my Boyon that celestial shore  Oh may we gladly meetand part no more  A PARENT  And now farewell my  friends  who have been pleased to peruse this narrative of my distresses with sympathetic sensibility particularly those whose goodness of heart can forgive my inaccuracies and foiblesI say farewell claiming no other merit whatever throughout these pages than that of having spoke the  simple truth  which if I wilfully have violated may these volumes perish and be forgotten with their authorBut should this treasure TRUTH so rarely to be met with be found in this performance  "Let one poor sprig of bays around my head  "Bloom while I live and point me out when dead"  THE END  INDEX TO THE SECOND VOLUME  A  ACCOREE
