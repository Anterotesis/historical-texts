 A LETTER FROM THE RIGHT HON EDMUND BURKE  MP  IN THE KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN TO SIR HERCULES LANGRISHE BART  MP  ON THE SUBJECT OF  ROMAN CATHOLICS OF IRELAND  AND THE PROPRIETY OF ADMITTING THEM TO THE  ELECTIVE FRANCHISE  CONSISTENTLY WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF THE CONSTITUTION AS ESTABLISHED AT THE  REVOLUTION  LONDON PRINTED FOR J DEBRETT OPPOSITE BURLINGTONHOUSE PICCADILLY MDCCXCII  LETTER  c  MY DEAR SIR  YOUR remembrance of me with sentiments of so much kindness has given me the most sincere satisfaction It perfectly agrees with the friendly and hospitable reception which my son and I received from you some time since when after an absence of twentytwo years I had the happiness of embracing you among my few surviving friends  I really imagined that I should not again interest myself in any public business I had to the best of my moderate faculties paid my club to the Society which I was born in some way or other to serve and I thought I had a right to put on my nightgown and slippers and wish a cheerful evening to the good company I must  leave behind But if our resolutions of vigour and exertion are so often broken or procrastinated in the exertion I think we may be excused if we are not very punctual in fulfilling our engagements to indolence and inactivity I have indeed no power of action and am almost a cripple even with regard to thinking but you descend with force into the stagnant pool and you cause such a fermentation as to cure at least one impotent creature of his lameness though it cannot enable him either to run or to wrestle  You see by the paper I take  The letter is written on folio sheets  that I am likely to be long with malice prepense You have brought under my view a subject always difficult at present criticalIt has filled my thoughts which I wish to lay open to you with the clearness and simplicity which your friendship demands from me I thank you for the communication of your ideas I should be still more pleased if they had been more your own What you hint I believe to be the case that if you had not deferred to the judgment of others our opinions would not differ more materially at this day than they did when we used to confer on the same subject so many years ago If I still persevere in my old opinions it is no small comfort  to me that it is not with regard to doctrines properly yours that I discover my indocility  The case upon which your letter of the th of December turns is hardly before me with precision enough to enable me to form any very certain judgment upon it It seems to be some plan of further indulgence proposed for Catholics of Ireland You observe  "that your general principles are not changed but  that times and circumstances are altered  "  I perfectly agree with you that times and circumstances considered with reference to the public ought very much to govern our conduct though I am far from slighting when applied with discretion to those circumstances general principles and maxims of policy I cannot help observing however that you have said rather less upon the applicability of your own old principles to the  circumstances  that are likely to influence your conduct against these principles than of the  general  maxims of state which I can very readily believe not to have great weight with you personally  In my present state of imperfect information you will pardon the errors into which I may  easily fall The principles you lay down are  "that the Roman Catholics should enjoy every thing  under  the state but should not be  the state itself  "  And you add  "that when you exclude them from being  a part of the state  you rather conform to the spirit of the age than to any abstract doctrine" but you consider the constitution is already establishedthat our state is Protestant  "It was declared so at the revolution It was so provided in the acts for settling the succession of the Crownthe King's coronation oath was enjoined in order to keep it so The King as first magistrate of the state is obliged to take the oath of abjuration and to subscribe the declaration and by laws subsequent every other magistrate and member of the state and legislature and executive are bound under the same obligation"  As to the plan to which these maxims are applied I cannot speak as I told you positively about it Because neither from your letter nor from any information I have been able to collect do I find any thing settled either on the part of the Roman Catholics themselves or on that of any persons who may wish to conduct their affairs in Parliament But if I have leave to  conjecture something is in agitation towards admitting them under  certain qualifications  to have  some share  in the election of members of parliament This I understand is the scheme of those who are intitled to come within your description of persons of consideration property and character and firmly attached to the king and constitution as by  "law established with a grateful sense of your former concessions and a patient reliance on the benignity of parliament for the further mitigation of the laws that still affect them"  As to the low thoughtless wild and profligate who have joined themselves with those of other professions but of the same character you are not to imagine that for a moment I can suppose them to be met with any thing else than the manly and enlightened energy of a firm government supported by the united efforts of all virtuous men if ever their proceedings should become so considerable as to demand its notice I really think that such associations should be crushed in their very commencement  Setting this therefore out of the question it becomes an object of very serious consideration whether because wicked men of  various  descriptions are engaged in seditious courses the rational sober and valuable part of  one  description should not  be indulged their sober and rational expectations You who have looked deeply into the spirit of the Popery laws must be perfectly sensible that a great part of the present mischief which we abhor in common has arisen from them Their declared object was to reduce the Catholics of Ireland to a miserable populace without property without estimation without education The professed object was to deprive the few men who in spite of those laws might hold or obtain any property amongst them of all sort of influence or authority over the rest They divided the nation into two distinct bodies without common interest sympathy or connexion one of which bodies was to possess  all  the franchises  all  the property  all  the education The others were to be drawers of water and cutters of turf for them Are we to be astonished that when by the efforts of so much violence in conquest and so much policy in regulation continued without intermission for near an hundred years we had reduced them to a mob that whenever they came to act at all many of them would act exactly like a mob without temper measure or foresight Surely it might be just now a matter of temperate discussion whether you ought not apply a remedy to the real cause of the evilto raise an aristocratic interest that is an interest of property and education  amongst them and to strengthen by every prudent means the authority and influence of men of that description It will deserve your best thoughts to examine whether this can be done without giving such persons the means of demonstrating to the rest that something more is to be got by their temperate conduct than can be expected from the will and senseless projects of those who do not belong to their body who have no interest in their well being and only wish to make them the dupes of their turbulent ambition  If the absurd persons you mention find no way of providing for liberty but by overturning this happy constitution and introducing a frantic democracy let us take care how we prevent better people from any rational expectations of partaking in the benefits of that constitution  as it stands  The maxims you establish cut the matter short They have no sort of connexion with the good or ill behaviour of the persons who seek relief or with the proper or improper means by which they seek it They form a perpetual bar to all pleas and to all expectations  You begin by asserting that  "they ought to enjoy all things  under  the state but that they  ought not to  be the state  "  A position which I believe in the latter part of it and in the latitude there expressed no man of common sense has ever thought proper to dispute because the contrary implies that the state ought to be in them  exclusively  But before you have finished the line you express yourself as if the other member of your proposition namely that  "they ought not to be  a part  of the state" were necessarily included in your firstWhereas I conceive it to be as different as a part is from the whole that is just as different as possible  I know indeed that it is common with those who talk very different from you that is with heat and animosity to confound those things and to argue the admission of the Catholics into any however minute and subordinate parts of the state as a surrender into their hands of the whole government of the kingdom To them I have nothing at all to say  Wishing to proceed with a deliberative spirit and temper in so very serious a question I shall attempt to analyze as well as I can the principles you lay down in order to sit them for the grasp of an understanding so little comprehensive as mine'State''Protestant''Revolution'These are terms which if not well explained  may lead us into many errorsIn the word  State  I conceive there is much ambiguity The state is sometimes used to signify  the whole commonwealth  comprehending all its orders with the several privileges belonging to each Sometimes it signifies only  the higher and ruling part  of the commonwealth which we commonly call  the Government  In the first sense to be under the state but not the state itself  nor any part of it  is a situation perfectly intelligible but to those who fill that situation not very pleasant when it is understood It is a state of  civil servitude  by the very force of the definition  Servorum non est respublica  is a very old and a very true maxim This servitude which makes men  subject  to a state without being  citizens  may be more or less tolerable from many circumstances but these circumstances more or less favourable do not alter the nature of the thing The mildness by which absolute masters exercise their dominion leaves them masters still We may talk a little presently of the manner in which the majority of the people of Ireland the Catholics are affected by this situation which at present undoubtedly is theirs and which you are of opinion ought to continue for ever  In the other sense of the word  State  by which is understood the  Supreme Government  only I must observe this upon the question that to exclude whole classes of men entirely from this  part  of government cannot be considered as  absolute slavery  It only implies a lower and degraded state of citizenship such is with more or less strictness the condition of all countries in which an hereditary nobility possess the exclusive rule This may be no bad mode of government provided that the personal authority of individual nobles be kept in due bounds that their cabals and factions are guarded against with a severe vigilance and that the people who have no share in granting their own money are subjected to but light impositions and are otherwise treated with attention and with indulgence to their humours and prejudices  The republic of Venice is one of those which strictly confines all the great functions and offices such as are truly  state  functions and  state  offices to those who by hereditary right or admission are noble Venetians But there are many offices and some of them not mean nor unprofitable which are reserved for the  Citadini  Of these all citizens of Venice are capable The inhabitants of the  Terra firma  who are mere subjects  of conquest that is as you express it under the state but "not a part of it" are not however subjects in so very rigorous a sense as not to be capable of numberless subordinate employments It is indeed one of the advantages attending the narrow bottom of their aristocracy narrow as compared with their acquired dominions otherwise broad enough that an exclusion from such employments cannot possibly be made amongst their subjects There are besides advantages in states so constituted by which those who are considered as of an inferior race are indemnified for their exclusion from the government and from noble employments In all these countries either by express laws or by usage more operative the noble casts are almost universally in their turn excluded from commerce manufacture farming of land and in general from all lucrative civil professions The nobles have the monopoly of honour The plebeians a monopoly of all the means of acquiring wealth Thus some sort of a balance is formed among conditions a sort of compensation is furnished to those who in a  limited sense  are excluded from the government of the state  Between the extreme of  a total exclusion  to which your maxim goes and  an universal unmodified  capacity  to which the fanatics pretend there are many different degrees and stages and a great variety of temperaments upon which prudence may give full scope to its exertions For you know that the decisions of prudence contrary to the system of the insane reasoners differ from those of judicature and that almost all the former are determined on the more or the less the earlier or the later and on a balance of advantage and inconvenience of good and evil  In all considerations which turn upon the question of vesting or continuing the state solely and exclusively in some one description of citizens prudent legislators will consider how far  the general form and principles of their commonwealth render it fit to be cost into an cligarchical shape or to remain always in it  We know that the government of Ireland the same as the British is not in its constitution  wholly  Aristocratical and as it is not such in its form so neither is it in its spirit If it had been inveterately aristocratical exclusions might be more patiently submitted to The lot of one plebeian would be the lot of all and an habitual reverence and admiration of certain families might make the people content to see government  wholly in hands to whom it seemed naturally to belong But our constitution has  a plebeian member  which forms an essential integrant part of it A plebeian oligarchy is a monster in itself and no people not absolutely domestic or predial slaves will long endure it The Protestants of Ireland are not  alone  sufficiently the people to form a democracy and they are  too numerous  to answer the ends and purposes of  an aristocracy  Admiration that first source of obedience can be only the claim or the imposture of the few I hold it to be absolutely impossible for two millions of plebeians composing certainly a very clear and decided majority in that class to become so far in love with six or seven hundred thousand of their fellowcitizens to all outward appearance plebeians like themselves and many of them tradesmen servants and otherwise inferior to them as to see with satisfaction or even with patience an exclusive power vested in them by which constitutionally they become their absolute masters and by the manners derived from their circumstances must be capable of exercising upon them daily and hourly an insulting and vexatious superiority nor are they indemnified as in some aristocracies for this state of humiliating vassalage often inverting the nature of things and relations by having the  lower walks of industry wholly abandoned to them They are rivalled to say the least of the matter in every laborious and lucrative course of life while every franchise every honour every trust every place down to the very lowest and least confidential besides whole professions is reserved for the master cast  Our constitution is not made for great general and proscriptive exclusions sooner or later it will destroy them or they will destroy the constitution In our constitution there has always been a difference made between  a franchise  and  an office  and between the capacity for the one and for the other Franchises were supposed to belong to the  subject  as  a subject  and not  as a member of the governing part of the state  The policy of Government has considered them as things very different for whilst Parliament excluded by the test acts and for a while these test acts were not a dead letter as now they are in England Protestant dissenters from all civil and military employments they  never touched their right of voting for members of Parliament or sitting in either House  a point I state not as approving or condemning the measure of exclusion from employments but to prove  that the distinction has been admitted in legislature as in truth it is founded in reason  I will not here examine whether the principles of the British the Irish constitution be wise or not I must assume that they are and that those who partake the franchises which make it partake of a benefit They who are excluded from votes under proper qualifications inherent in the constitution that gives them are excluded not from the  state  but from  the British constitution  They cannot by any possibility whilst they hear its praises continually rung in their ears and are present at the declaration which is so generally and so bravely made by those who possess the privilegethat the best blood in their veins ought to be shed to preserve their share in it they cannot I say think themselves in an  happy  state to be utterly excluded from all its direct and all its consequential advantages The popular part of the constitution must be to them by far the most odious part of it To them it is not  an actual  and if possible still less a  virtual  representation It is indeed the direct contrary It is power unlimited placed in the hands of  an adverse  description  because it is an adverse description  And if they who compose the privileged  body have not an interest they must but too frequently have motives of pride passion petulance peevish jealousy or tyrannic suspicion to urge them to treat the people with contempt and rigour  This is not a mere theory though whilst men are men it is a theory that cannot be false I do not wish to revive all the particulars in my memory I wish them to sleep for ever but it it is impossible I should wholly forget what happened in some parts of Ireland with very few and short intermissions from the year to the year both inclusive In a country of miserable police passing from the extremes of laxity to the extremes of rigour among a neglected and therefore disorderly populaceif any disturbance or sedition from any grievance real or imaginary happened to arise it was presently perverted from its true nature often criminal enough in itself to draw upon it a severe appropriate punishment it was metamorphosed into a conspiracy against the state and prosecuted as such The object was that those persons in the obnoxious description in which all offenders will be most commonly found because the most numerous and the most wretched who could not easily from their character and property be suspected of the  crimes of the lowest people might be involved in the odium in the suspicion and sometimes in the punishment of a higher and far more criminal species of offence This did not arise from any one of the Popery laws since repealed but from this circumstance that the people of that description had no hold on the gentlemen who aspired to be popular representatives and that the candidates neither loved nor respected nor feared them individually or collectively I do not think this evil an evil amongst a thousand others at this day entirely over for I conceive I have lately seen some indication of a disposition perfectly similar to the old ones that is a disposition to carry the imputation of crimes from persons to descriptions and wholly to alter the character and quality of the offences themselves  This universal exclusion seems to me a serious evilbecause many collateral oppressions besides what I have just now stated have arisen from it In things of this nature it would not be either easy or proper to quote chapter and verse but I have great reason to believe particularly since the octenial act that several have refused at all to let their lands to Roman Catholics because it would so far disable them from promoting such interests in  counties as they were inclined to favour They who consider also the state of all sorts of tradesmen shopkeepers and particularly publicans in towns must soon discern the disadvantages under which those labour who have no votes It cannot be otherwise whilst the spirit of elections and the tendencies of human nature continue as they are If property be artificially separated from franchise the franchise must in some way or other and in some proportion naturally attract property to it Many are the collateral disadvantages amongst a  privileged  people which must attend those who have  no  privileges Among the rich each individual is of importance the poor and the middling are no otherwise so than as they obtain some collective capacity and can be aggregated to some corps If legal ways are not found illegal will be resorted to and seditious clubs and confederacies such as no man living holds in greater horror than I do will grow and flourish in spite I am afraid of any thing which can be done to prevent the evil Lawful enjoyment is the surest method to prevent unlawful gratification Where there is property there will be less theft where there is marriage there will always be less fornication  I have said enough of the question of state  as it affects the people merely as such  But it is complicated with a political question relative to religion to which it is very necessary I should say something because the term  Protestant  which you apply is too general for the conclusions which one of your accurate understanding would wish to draw from it and because a great deal of argument will depend on the use that is made of that term  It is  not  a fundamental part of the settlement at the revolution that the state should be protestant without  any qualification of the term  With a qualification it is unquestionably true not in all its latitude With the qualification it was true before the revolution Our predecessors in legislation were not so irrational not to say impious as to form an operose ecclesiastical establishment and even to render the state itself in some degree subservient to it when their religion if such it might be called was nothing but a mere  negation  of some otherwithout any positive idea either of doctrine discipline worship or morals which they professed themselves and which they imposed upon others even under penalties and incapacitiesNo No This never could have been done even by reasonable Atheists They who think religion of no importance  to the state have abandoned it to the conscience or caprice of the individual they make no provision for it whatsoever but leave every club to make or not a voluntary contribution according to their fancies This would be consistent The other always appeared to me to be a monster of contradiction and absurdity It was for that reason that some years ago I strenuously opposed the clergy who petitioned to the number of about three hundred to be freed from the subscription to the Articles without proposing to substitute any other in their place There never has been a religion of the state the few years of the Parliament only excepted but that of  the church of England  the church of England before the reformation connected with the See of Rome since then disconnected and protesting against some of her doctrines and the whole of her authority as binding in our national church nor did the fundamental laws of this kingdom in Ireland it has been the same ever know at any period any other church  as an object of establishment  or in that light any other Protestant religion Nay our Protestant  toleration  itself at the revolution and until within a few years required a signature of thirtysix and a part of a thirtyseventh out of the thirtynine Articles So little idea had they at the revolution of  establishing  Protestantism indefinitely  that they did not indefinitely  tolerate  it under that name I do not mean to praise that strictness where nothing more than merely religious toleration is concerned Toleration being a part of moral and political prudence ought to be tender and large and not too scrupulous in its investigations but may bear without blame not only very illgrounded doctrines but even many things that are positively vices where they are  adulta et praevalida  The good of the commonwealth is the rule which rides over the rest and to this every other must completely submit  The church of Scotland knows as little of Protestantism  undefined  as the church of England and Ireland do She has by the articles of union secured to herself the perpetual establishment of  the Confession of Faith  and the  Presbyterian  church government In England even during the troubled interregnum it was not thought fit to establish a  negative  religion but the Parliament settled the  Presbyterian  as the church  discipline  the directory as the rule of public  worship  and the  Westminster catechism  as the institute of  faith  This is to shew that at no time was the Protestant religion  undefined  established here or any where else as I believe I am sure that when the three religions were  established in Germany they were expressly characterized and declared to be the  Evangelic  and  Reformed  and the  Catholic  each of which has its confession of faith and its settled discipline so that you always may know the best and the worst of them to enable you to make the most of what is good and to correct or qualify or guard against whatever may seem evil or dangerous  As to the coronation oath to which you allude as opposite to admitting a Roman Catholic to the use of any franchise whatsoever I cannot think that the king would be perjured if he gave his assent to any regulation which Parliament might think fit to make with regard to that affair The king is bound by law as clearly specified in several acts of Parliament to be in communion with the church of England It is a part of the tenure by which he holds his crown and though no provision was made till the revolution which could be called positive and valid in law to ascertain this great principle I have always considered it as in fact fundamental that the king of England should be of the Christian religion according to the national legal church for the time being I conceive it was so before the reformation and that since the reformation it became doubly necessary  because the king is the head of that church in some sort an ecclesiastical person and it would be incongruous and absurd to have the head of the church of one faith and the members of another The king may  inherit  the crown as a  Protestant  but he cannot  hold it  according to law without being a Protestant  of the church of England    Before we take it for granted that the king is bound by his coronation oath not to admit any of his Catholic subjects to the rights and liberties which ought to belong to them as Englishmen not as religionists or to settle the conditions or proportions of such admission by an act of Parliament I wish you to place before your eyes that oath itself as it is settled in the act of William and Mary  "Will you to the utmost of your power maintain    The laws of God    the true Profession of    the gospeland    The protestant reformed religion  as it is established by law      And will you preserve unto  bishops  and clergy and the churches committed to  their  charge all such rights and privileges as by law do or shall appertain to them or any of themAll this I promise to do"  Here are the coronation engagements of the King In them I do not find one word to preclude his Majesty from consenting to any arrangement which Parliament may make with regard to the civil privileges of any part of his subjects  It may not be amiss on account of the light which it may throw on this discussion to look a little more narrowly into the matter of that oathin order to discover how far it has hitherto operated as a bar to any proceedings of the Crown and Parliament in favour of those against whom it may be supposed that the king has engaged to support the Protestant church of England in the two kingdoms in which it is established by law First the king swears he will maintain to the utmost of his power  "the laws of God"  I suppose it means the natural moral lawsSecondly he swears to maintain "the true profession of the Gospel" By which I suppose is understood  affirmatively  the Christian religionThirdly that he will maintain  "the Protestant reformed religion"  This leaves me no power of supposition or conjecture for it is defined and described by the subsequent words "established by law" and in this instance to  define it beyond all possibility of doubt he  "swears to maintain the bishops and clergy and the churches committed to their charge" in their rights present and future  This oath as effectually prevents the King from doing any thing to the prejudice of the church in favour of Sectaries Jews Mahometans or plain avowed Infidels just as if he should do the same thing in favour of the Catholics You will see that it is the same Protestant Church so described which the King is to maintain and communicate with according to the act of settlement of the th and th of William III The act of the th of Anne made in prospect of the union is entitled  "An act for securing the Church of England as by law established"  It meant to guard the church implicitly against any other mode of Protestant religion which might creep in by means of the union It proves beyond all doubt that the legislature did not mean to guard the church on one part only and to leave it defenceless and exposed upon every other This church in that act is declared to be "fundamental and essential" for ever in the costitution of the united kingdom so far as England is concerned and I suppose as the law  stands even since the independence it is so in Ireland  All this shews that the religion which the King is bound to maintain has a positive part in it as well as a negative and that the positive part of it in which we are in perfect agreement with the Catholics and with the Church of Scotland is infinitely the most valuable and essential Such an agreement we had with Protestant Dissenters in England of those descriptions who came under the toleration act of King William and Queen Mary an act coeval with the revolution and which ought on the principles of the gentlemen who oppose the relief to the Catholics to have been held sacred and unalterable Whether we agree with the present Protestant Dissenters in the points at the revolution held essential and fundamental among Christians or in any other fundamental at present it is impossible for us to know because at their own very earnest desire we have repealed the toleration act of William and Mary and discharged them from the signature required by that act and because we know that for the far greater part they publicly declare against all manner of confessions of faith even the  consensus    I dwell a little the longer upon this matter and take the more pains to put us both in mind that it was not settled at the revolution that the state should be protestant in the latitude of the term but in a defined and limited sense only and that in that sense only the King is sworn to maintain it for reasons forcible enough at all times but at this time peculiarly so To suppose that the King has sworn with his utmost power to maintain what it is wholly out of his power to discover or which if he could discover he might discover to consist of things directly contradictory to each other some of them perhaps impious blasphemous and seditious upon principle would be not only a gross but a most mischievous absurdity It would make a merit of dissenting from the church of England because the man happens to dissent from the church of Rome also for a man is certainly the most perfect Protestant and the most perfect Dissenter who protests against and dissents from the whole Christian Religion Whether a person's having no Christian Religion be a title to favour in exclusion to the largest description of Christians who hold all the doctrines of Christianity though holding along with them some errors and some superfluities is rather more than any man  who has not become recreant and apostate from his baptism will I believe choose to affirm The countenance given from a spirit of controversy to that negative religion may by degrees encourage light and unthinking people to a total indifference to every thing positive in matters of doctrine and in the end of practice too If continued it would play the game of that sort of of active proselytizing and persecuting atheism which is the disgrace and calamity of our time and which we see to be as capable of subverting a government as any mode of misguided zeal for better things  Now let us fairly see what course has been taken relative to those against whom in part at least the King has sworn to maintain a church  positive in its doctrine and its discipline  The first thing done even when the oath was fresh in the mouth of the sovereigns was to give a toleration to Protestant Dissenters  whose doctrines they ascertained  As to the mere civil privileges which the Dissenters held as subjects before the revolution these were not touched at all The laws have fully permitted in a qualification for all offices to such Dissenters  an occasional conformity  a thing I believe singular where tests are admitted The act called the Test Act itself is with  regard to them grown to be hardly any thing more than a dead letter Whenever the Dissenters cease by their conduct to give any alarm to the government in church and state I think it very probable that even this matter rather disgustful than inconvenient to them may be removed or at least so modified as to distinguish the qualification to those offices which really  guide the state  from those which are  merely instrumental  or that some other and better tests may be put in their place  So far as to England In Ireland you have outran us Without waiting for an English example you have totally and without any modification whatsoever repealed the test as to Protestant Dissenters Not having the repealing act by me I ought not to say positively that there is no exception in it but if it be what I suppose you know very well that a Jew in religion or a Mahometan or even  a public declared Athiest  and blasphemer is perfectly qualified to be lord lieutenant a lord justice or even keeper of the king's conscience and by virtue of his office if with you it be as it is with us administrator to a great part of the ecclesiastical patronage of the crown  Now let us deal a little fairly We must admit that Protestant dissent was one of the quarters from which danger was apprehended at the revolution and against which a part of the coronation oath was peculiarly directed By this unqualified repeal you certainly did not mean to deny that it was the duty of the crown to preserve the church against Protestant Dissenters or taking this to be the true sense of the two revolution acts of King William and of the previous and subsequent union acts of Queen Anne you did not declare by this most unqualified repeal by which you broke down all the barriers not invented indeed but carefully preserved at the revolution you did not then and by that proceeding declare that you had advised the king to perjury towards God and perfidy towards the church No far very far from it you never would have done it if you did not think it could be done with perfect repose to the royal conscience and perfect safety to the national established religion You did this upon a full consideration of the circumstances of your country Now if circumstances required it why should it be contrary to the king's oath his parliament judging on those circumstances to restore to his Catholic people in such measure and  with such modifications as the public wisdom shall think proper to add  some part  in these franchises which they formerly had held without any limitation at all and which upon no sort of urgent reason at the time they were deprived of If such means can with any probability be shewn from circumstances rather to add strength to our mixed ecclesiastical and secular constitution than to weaken it surely they are means infinitely to be preferred to penalties incapacities and proscriptions continued from generation to generation They are perfectly consistent with the other parts of the Coronation Oath in which the king swears to maintain  "the laws of God and the true profession of the gospel and to govern the people according to the statutes in Parliament agreed upon and the laws and customs of the realm"  In consenting to such a statute the Crown would act at least as agreeble to the laws of God and to the true profession of the gospel and to the laws and customs of the kingdom as George I did when he passed the statute which took from the body of the people every thing which to that hour and even after the monstrous acts of the d and th of Anne the objects of common hatred they still enjoyed inviolate  It is hard to distinguish with the last degree of accuracy what laws are fundamental and what not However there is a distinction authorized by the writers on jurisprudence and recognized in some of our statutes I admit the acts of King William and Queen Anne to be fundamental but they are not the  only  fundamental laws The law called  Magna Charta  by which it is provided that  "no man shall be disseized of his liberties and free customs but by the judgment of his peers or the laws of the land" meaning clearly for some proved crime tried and adjudged I take to be a  fundamental law    Now although this Magna Charta or some of the statutes establishing it provide that that law shall be perpetual and all statutes contrary to it shall be void yet I cannot go so far as to deny the authority of statutes made in defiance of Magna Charta and all its principles This however I will say that it is a very venerable law made by very wise and learned men and that the legislature in their attempt to perpetuate it even against the authority of future parliaments have shewn their judgment that it is  fundamental  on the same grounds and in the same manner that the act of the fifth of Anne has considered and declared the establishment of the church of England to be fundamental Magna Charta which secured these franchises to the  subjects regarded the rights of freeholders in counties to be as much a fundamental part of the constitution as the establishment of the church of England was thought either at that time or in the act of King William or in the act of Queen Anne  The churchmen who led in that transaction certainly took care of the material interest of which they were the natural guardians It is the first article of Magna Charta  "that the church of England shall be free" c c  But churchmen and barons and knights took care of the franchises and free customs of the people too Those franchises are part of the constitution itself and inseparable from it It would be a very strange thing if there should not only exist anomalies in our laws a thing not easy to prevent but that the fundamental parts of the constitution should be perpetually and irreconcilably at variance I cannot persuade myself that the lovers of our church are not as able to find effectual ways of reconciling its safety with the franchises of the people as the ecclesiastics of the thirteenth century were able to do I cannot conceive how any thing worse can be said of the Protestant religion of the church of England than this that wherever it is judged proper to give it a legal establishment  it becomes necessary to deprive the body of the people if they adhere to their old opinions of "their liberties and of all their free customs" and to reduce them to a state of  civil  servitude  There is no man on earth I believe more willing than I am to lay it down as a fundamental of the constitution that the church of England should be united and even identified with it but allowing this I cannot allow that all  laws of regulation  made from time to time in support of that fundamental law are of course equally fundamental and equally unchangeable This would be to confound all the branches of legislation and of jurisprudenceThe  Crown  and the personal safety of the monarch are  fundamentals  in our constitution Yet I hope that no man regrets that the rabble of statutes got together during the reign of Henry the Eighth by which treasons are multiplied with so prolific an energy have been all repealed in a body although they were all or most of them made in support of things truly fundamental in our constitution So were several of the acts by which the crown exercised its supremacy such as the act of Elizabeth for making the  high commission courts  and the like as well as things made treason in the time of Charles II None of this species of  secondary and subsidiary laws  have been held fundamental They have yielded to circumstances particularly where they were thought even in their consequences or obliquely to affect other fundamentals How much more certainly ought they to give way when as in our case they effect not here and there in some particular point or in their consequence but universally collectively and directly the fundamental franchises of a people equal to the whole inhabitants of several respectable kingdoms and states equal to the subjects of the kings of Sardinia or Denmark equal to those of the United Netherlands and more than are to be found in all the states of Switzerland This way of proscribing men by whole nations as it were from all the benefits of the constitution to which they were born I never can believe to be politic or expedient much less necessary for the existence of any state or church in the world Whenever I shall be convinced which will be late and reluctantly that the safety of the church is utterly inconsistent with all the civil rights whatsoever of the far larger part of the inhabitants of our country I shall be extremely sorry for it because I shall think the church to be truly in danger It is putting things into the position of  an ugly alternative into which I hope in God they never will be put  I have said most of what occurs to me on the topics you touch upon relative to the religion of the king and his coronation oath I shall conclude the observations which I wished to submit to you on this point by assuring you that I think you the most remote that can be conceived from the metaphysicians of our times who are the most foolish of men and who dealing in universals and essences see no difference between more and less and who of course would think that the reason of the law which obliged the king to be a communicant of the church of England would be as valid to exclude a Catholic from being an exciseman or to deprive a man who has five hundred a year under that description from voting on a par with a factitious Protestant Dissenting freeholder of forty shillings  Recollect my dear friend that it was a fundamental principle in the French monarchy whilst it stood that the state should be Catholic yet the edict of Nantz gave not a full ecclesiastical but a complete civil  establishment  with places of which only they were capable to the Calvinists of France and there were very few employments indeed of which they were not capable The  world praised the Cardinal de Richlieu who took the first opportunity to strip them of their fortified places and cautionary towns The same world held and does hold in execration so far as that business is concerned the memory of Louis the Fourteenth for the total repeal of that favourable edict though the talk of  "fundamental laws established religion religion of the prince safety to the state"  c c  was then as largely held and with as bitter a revival of the animosities of the civil confusions during the struggles between the parties as now they can be in Ireland  Perhaps there are those who think that the same reason does not hold when the religious relation of the sovereign and subject is changed but they who have their shop full of false weights and measures and who think that the adding or taking away the name of Protestant or Papist Guelph or Ghibelline alters all the principles of equity policy and prudence leave us no common data upon which we can reason I therefore pass by all this which on you will make no impression to come to what seems to be a serious consideration in your mind I mean the dread you express of  "reviewing for the purpose of altering the  principles of the Revolution  "  This is an interesting topic on which I will as fully  as your leisure and mine permits lay before you the ideas I have formed  First I cannot possibly confound in my mind all the things which were done at the Revolution with the  principles  of the Revolution As in most great changes many things were done from the necessities of the time well or ill understood from passion or from vengeance which were not only not perfectly agreeable to its principles but in the most direct contradiction to them I shall not think that the  deprivation of some millions of people of all the rights of citizens and all interest in the constitution in and to which they were born  was a thing conformable to the  declared principles  of the Revolution This I am sure is true relatively to England where the operation of these  anti principles  comparatively were of little extent and some of our late laws on that subject admit it But the Revolution operated differently in England and Ireland in many and these essential particulars Supposing the principles to have been altogether the same in both kingdoms by the application of those principles to very different objects the whole spirit of the system was changed not to say reversed In England it was the struggle of the  great body  of the people for the establishment  of their liberties against the efforts of a very  small faction  who would have oppressed them In Ireland it was the establishment of the power of the smaller number at the expence of the civil liberties and properties of the far greater part and at the expence of the political liberties of the whole It was to say the truth not a revolution but a conquest which is not to say a great deal in its favour To insist on every thing done in Ireland at the Revolution would be to insist on the severe and jealous policy of a conqueror in the crude settlement of his new acquisition as a  permanent  rule for its future government This no power in no country that ever I heard of has done or professed to doexcept in Ireland where it is done and possibly by some people will be professed Time has by degrees in all other places and periods blended and coalited the conquered with the conquerors So after some time and after one of the most rigid conquests that we read of in history the Normans softened into the English I wish you to turn your recollection to the fine speech of Cerealis to the Gauls to dissuade them from revolt Speaking of the Romans  "  Nos  quamvis toties lacessiti jure victoriae id solum vobis addidimus quo pacem tueremur nam  neque quies gentium sine armis neque arma sine stipendiis neque stipendia sine tributis haberi queant  Caetera in communi sita sunt  ipsi plerumque nostris exercitibus  praesidetis  ipsi has aliasque provincias  regitis nil seperatum clausumve  Proinde Pacem et urbem quam  victores victique eodem jure obtinemus  amate colite"  You will consider whether the arguments used by that Roman to these Gauls would apply to the case in Ireland and whether you could use so plausible a preamble to any severe warning you might think it proper to hold out to those who should resort to sedition instead of supplication to obtain any object that they may pursue with the governing power  For a much longer period than that which had sufficed to blend the Romans with the nation to which of all others they were the most adverse the Protestants settled in Ireland considered themselves in no other light than that of a sort of a colonial garrison to keep the natives in subjection to the other state of Great Britain The whole spirit of the revolution in Ireland was that of not the mildest conqueror In truth the spirit of those proceedings did not commence at that aera nor was religion of any kind their  primary object What was done was not in the spirit of a contest between two religious factions but between two adverse nations The statutes of Kilkenny shew that the spirit of the popery laws and some even of their actual provisions as applied between Englishry and Irishry had existed in that harassed country before the words Protestant and Papist were heard of in the world If we read Baron Finglas Spenser and Sir John Davis we cannot miss the true genius and policy of the English government there before the revolution as well as during the whole reign of Queen Elizabeth Sir John Davis boasts of the benefits received by the natives by extending to them the English law and turning the whole kingdom into shire ground But the appearance of things alone was changed The original scheme was never deviated from for a single hour Unheard of confiscations were made in the northern parts upon grounds of plots and conspiracies never proved upon their supposed authors The war of chicane succeeded to the war of arms and of hostile statutes and a regular series of operations were carried on particularly from Chichester's time in the ordinary courts of justice and by special commissions and inquisitions first under pretence of tenures and then of titles in the crown for the purpose of the total  extirpation of the interest of the natives in their own soiluntil this species of subtile ravage being carried to the last excess of oppression and insolence under Lord Stafford it kindled at length the flames of that rebellion which broke out in By the issue of that war by the turn which the Earl of Clarendon gave to things at the restoration and by the total reduction of the kingdom of Ireland in the ruin of the native Irish and in a great measure too of the first races of the English was completely accomplished The new English interest was settled with as solid a stability as any thing in human affairs can look for All the penal laws of that unparalleled code of oppression which were made after the last event were manifestly the effects of national hatred and scorn towards a conquered people whom the victors delighted to trample upon and were not at all afraid to provoke They were not the effect of their fears but of their security They who carried on this system looked to the irresistible force of Great Britain for their support in their acts of power They were quite certain that no complaints of the natives would be heard on this side of the water with any other sentiments than those of contempt and indignation Their cries served only to augment their torture Machines  which could answer their purposes so well must be of an excellent contrivance Indeed at that time in England the double name of the complainants Irish and Papists it would be hard to say singly which was the most odious shut up the hearts of every one against them Whilst that temper prevailed and it prevailed in all its force to a time within our memory every measure was pleasing and popular just in proportion as it tended to harass and ruin a set of people who were looked upon as enemies to God and man and indeed as a race of bigotted savages who were a disgrace to human nature itself  However as the English in Ireland began to be domiciliated they began also to recollect that they had a country The  English interest  at first by faint and almost insensible degrees but at length openly and avowedly became an  independent Irish interest  full as independent as it could ever have been if it had continued in the persons of the native Irish and it was maintained with more skill and more consistency than probably it would have been in theirs With their views they changed their maximsit was necessary to demonstrate to the whole people that  there was something at least of a common interest combined with the independency which was to become the object of common exertions The mildness of government produced the first relaxation towards the Irish the necessities and in part too the temper that predominated at this great change produced the second and the most important of these relaxations English government and Irish legislature felt jointly the propriety of this measure The Irish parliament and nation became independent  The true revolution to you that which most intrinsically and substantially resembled the English revolution of was the Irish revolution of The Irish Parliament of bore little resemblance to that which sat in that kingdom after the period of the first revolution it bore a much nearer resemblance though not at all in its temper to that which sat under King James The change of the Parliament in from the character of the Parliament which as a token of its indignation had burned all the journals indiscriminately of the former Parliament in the council chamber was very visible The address of King William's Parliament  the Parliament which assembled after the Revolution amongst other causes of complaint many of them sufficiently just complains of the repeal by their predecessors of Poyning's law no absolute idol with the Parliament of  Great Britain finding the AngloIrish highly animated with a spirit which had indeed shewn itself before though with little energy and many interruptions and therefore suffered a multitude of uniform precedents to be established against it acted in my opinion with the greatest temperance and wisdom She saw that the disposition of the  leading part  of the nation would not permit them to act any longer the part of a  garrison  She saw that true policy did not require that they ever should have appeared in that character or if it had done so formerly the reasons had now ceased to operate She saw that the Irish of her race were resolved to build their constitution and their politics upon another bottom With those things under her view she instantly complied with the whole of your demands without any reservation whatsover She surrendered that boundless superiority for the preservation of which and the acquisition she had supported the English colonies in Ireland for so long a time and at so vast an expence  according to the standard of those ages of her blood and treasure  When we bring before us the matter which history affords for our selection it is not improper to examine the spirit of the several precedents which are candidates for our choice Might it not be as well for your statesmen on the other side of the water to take an example from this latter and surely more conciliatory revolution as a pattern for your conduct towards your own fellowcitizens than from that of when a paramount sovereignty over both you and them was more loftily claimed and more sternly exerted than at any former or at any subsequent period Great Britain in rose above the vulgar ideas of policy the ordinary jealousies of state and all the sentiments of national pride and national ambition If she had been more disposed than I thank God for it she was to listen to the suggestions of passion than to the dictates of prudence she might have urged the principles the maxims the policy the practice of the revolution against the demands of the leading description in Ireland with full as much plausibility and full as good a grace as any amongst them can possibly do against the supplications of so vast and extensive  a description of their own people A good deal too if the spirit of domination and exclusion had prevailed in England might be excepted against some of the means then employed in Ireland whilst her claims ware in agitation they were at least as much out of ordinary course as those which are now objected against admitting your people to any of the benefits of an English constitution  Most certainly neither with you nor here was any one ignorant of what was at that time said written and done But on all sides we separated the means from the end and we separated the cause of the moderate and rational from the illintentioned and seditious which on such occasions are so frequently apt to march together At that time on your part you were not afraid to review what was done at the revolution of and what had been continued during the subsequent flourishing period of the British empire The change then made was a great and fundamental alteration In the execution it was an operose business on both sides of the water It required the repeal of several laws the modification of many and a new course to be given to an infinite number of legislative judicial and official practices and usages  in both kingdoms This did not frighten any of us You are now asked to give in some moderate measure to your fellowcitizens what Great Britain gave to you without any measure at all Yet notwithstanding all the difficulties at the time and the apprehensions which some very wellmeaning people entertained through the admirable temper in which this revolution or restoration in the nature of a revolution was conducted in both kingdoms it has hitherto produced no inconvenience to either and I trust with the continuance of the same temper that it never will I think that this small inconsiderable change relative to an exclusion statute not made at the revolution for restoring the people to the benefits from which the green soreness of a civil war had not excluded them will be productive of no sort of mischief whatsoever Compare what was done in with what is wished in consider the spirit of what has been done at the several periods of reformation and weigh maturely whether it be exactly true that conciliatory concessions are of good policy only in discussions between nations but that among descriptions in the same nation they must always be irrational and dangerous What have you suffered in your peace your prosperity or in what ought ever to be dear to a nation your  glory by the last act by which you took the property of that people under the protection of the  laws  What reason have you to dread the consequences of admitting the people possessing that propety to some share in the protection of the  constitution  I do not mean to trouble you with any thing to remove the objections I will not call them arguments against this measure taken from a ferocious hatred to all that numerous description of Christians It would be to pay a poor compliment to your understanding or your heart Neither  your  religion nor  your  politics consist "in odd perverse antipathies" You are not resolved to persevere in proscribing from the constitution so many millions of your countrymen because in contradiction to experience and to common sense you think proper to imagine that their principles are subversive of common human society To that I shall only say that whoever has a temper which can be gratified by indulging himself in these goodnatured fancies ought to do a great deal more For an exclusion from the privileges of British subjects is not a cure for so terrible a distemper of the human mind as they are pleased to suppose in their countrymen I rather conceive those privileges  to be itself a remedy for some mental disorders  As little shall I detain you with matters that can as little obtain admission into a mind like yours such as the fear or pretence of fear that in spite of your own power and the trifling power of Great Britain you may be conquered by the Pope or that this commodious bugbear who is of infinitely more use to those who pretend to fear than to those who love him will absolve his Majesty's subjects from their allegiance and send over the cardinal of York to rule you as his viceroy or that by the plenitude of his power he will take that fierce tyrant the king of the French out of his jail and arm that nation which on all occasions treats his Holiness so very politely with his bulls and pardons to invade poor old Ireland to reduce you to popery and slavery and to force the freeborn naked feet of your people into the wooden shoes of that arbitrary monarch I do not believe that discourses of this kind are held or that any thing like them will be held by any who walk about without a keeper Yet I confess that on occasions of this nature I am the most afraid of the weakest reasonings because they discover the strongest passions These things will never be  brought out in definite propositions they would not prevent pity towards any persons they would only cause it for those who were capable of talking in such a strain But I know and am sure that such ideas as no man will distinctly produce to another or hardly venture to bring in any plain shape to his own mindhe will utter in obscure ill explained doubts jealousies surmises fears and apprehensions and that in such a fog they will appear to have a good deal of size and will make an impression when if they were clearly brought forth and defined they would meet with nothing but scorn and derision  There is another way of taking an objection to this concession which I admit to be something more plausible and worthy of a more attentive examination It is that this numerous class of people is mutinous disorderly prone to sedition and easy to be wrought upon by the insidious arts of wicked and designing men that conscious of this the sober rational and wealthy part of that body who are totally of another character do by no means desire any participation for themselves or for any one else of their description in the franchises of the British constitution  I have great doubt of the exactness of any part of this observation But let us admit that the body of the Catholics are prone to sedition of which as I have said I entertain much doubt is it possible that any fair observer or fair reasoner can think of confining this description to them only I believe it to be possible for men to be mutinous and seditious who feel no grievance but I believe no man will assert seriously that when people are of a turbulent spirit the best way to keep them in order is to furnish them with something substantial to complain of  You separate very properly the sober rational and substantial part of their description from the rest You give as you ought to do weight only to the former What I have always thought of the matter is thisthat the most poor illiterate and uninformed creatures upon earth are judges of a  practical  oppression It is a matter of feeling and as such persons generally have felt most of it and are not of an overlively sensibility they are the best judges of it But for the  real cause  or the  appropriate remedy  they ought never to be called into council about the one or the other They ought to be totally shut out because their reason is weak because  when once roused their passions are ungoverned because they want information because the smallness of the property which individually they possess renders them less attentive to the consequence of the measures they adopt in affairs of moment When I find a great cry amongst the people who speculate little I think myself called seriously to examine into it and to separate the real cause from the ill effects of the passion it may excite and the bad use which artful men may make of an irritation of the popular mind Here we must be aided by persons of a contrary character we must not listen to the desperate or the furious but it is therefore necessary for us to distinguish who are the  really  indigent and the  really  intemperate As to the persons who desire this part in the constitution I have no reason to imagine that they are persons who have nothing to lose and much to look for in public confusion The popular meeting from which apprehensions have been entertained has assembled I have accidentally had conversation with two friends of mine who knew something of the gentleman who was put into the chair upon that occasion one of them has had money transactions with him the other from curiosity has been to see his concerns they both tell me he is a man of some property but you must be  the best judge of this who by your office are likely to know his transactions Many of the others are certainly persons of fortune and all or most fathers of families men in respectable ways of life and some of them far from contemptible either for their information or for the abilities which they have shewn in the discussion of their interests What such men think it for their advantage to acquire ought not  prima facia  to be considered as rash or heady or incompatible with the public safety or welfare  I admit that men of the best fortunes and reputations and of the best talents and education too may by accident shew themselves furious and intemperate in their desires This is a great misfortune when it happens for the first presumptions are undoubtedly in their favour We have two standards of judging in this case of the sanity and sobriety of any proceedings of the subject proceeding of unequal certainty indeed but neither of them to be neglected the first is by the value of the object sought the next is by the means through which it is pursued  The object pursued I understand and have all along reasoned as if it were so is in some degree or measure to be admitted to the franchises of the constitution Men are considered  as under some derangement of their intellects when they see good and evil in a different light from other men when they choose nauseous and unwholesome food and reject such as to the rest of the world seems pleasant and is known to be nutritive I have always considered the British constitution not to be a thing in itself so vitious as that none but men of deranged understanding and turbulent tempers could desire a share in it on the contrary I should think very indifferently of the understanding and temper of any body of men who did not wish to partake of this great and acknowledged benefit I cannot think quite so favourably either of the sense or temper of those if any such there are who would voluntarily persuade their brethren that the object is not fit for them or they for the object Whatever may be my thoughts I am quite sure that they who hold such language must forfeit all credit with the rest This is infallibleIf they conceive any opinion of their judgment they cannot possibly think them their friends There is indeed one supposition which would reconcile the conduct of such gentlemen to found reason and to the purest affection towards their fellowsufferers that is that they act under the impression of a wellgrounded fear for the  general interest If they should be told and should believe the story that if they dare attempt to make their condition better they will infallibly make it worsethat if they aim at obtaining liberty they will have their slavery doubledthat their endeavour to put themselves upon any thing which approaches towards an equitable footing with their fellowsubjects will be considered as an indication of a seditious and rebellious dispositionsuch a view of things ought perfectly to restore the gentlemen who so anxiously dissuade their countrymen from wishing a participation with the privileged part of the people to the good opinion of their fellows But what is to  them  a very full justification is not quite so honourable to that power from whose maxims and temper so good a ground of rational terror is furnished I think arguments of this kind will never be used by the friends of a government which I greatly respect or by any of the leaders of an opposition whom I have the honour to know and the sense to admire I remember Polybius tells us that during his captivity in Italy as a Peloponesian hostagehe solicited old Cato to intercede with the senate for his release and that of his countrymen this old politician told him that he had better continue in his present condition  however irksome than apply again to that formidable authority for their relief that he ought to imitate the wisdom of his countryman Ulysses who when he was once out of the den of the Cyclops had too much sense to venture again into the same cavern But I conceive too high an opinion of the Irish Legislature to think that they are to their fellow citizen what the grand oppressors of mankind were to a people whom the fortune of war had subjected to their power For though Cato could do so with regard to his senate I should really think it nothing short of impious to compare an Irish Parliament to a den of Cyclops I hope the people both here and with you will always apply to their representatives with becoming modesty but at the same time with minds unembarrassed with any sort of terror  As to the means which they employ to obtain this object so worthy of the sober and rational minds I do admit that such means may be used in the pursuit of it as may make it proper for legislature in this case to defer their compliance until the demandants are brought to a proper sense of their duty A concession in which the governing power of our country loses its dignity  is dearly bought even by him who obtains his object All the people have a deep interest in the dignity of Parliament But as the refusal of franchises which are drawn out of the first vital stamina of the British constitution is a very serious thing we ought to be very sure that the manner and spirit of the application is offensive and dangerous indeed before we ultimately reject all applications of this nature The mode of application I hear is by petition It is the manner in which all the sovereign powers of the world are approached and I never heard except in the case of James the second that any prince considered this manner of supplication to be contrary to the humility of a subject or to the respect due to the person or authority of the sovereign This rule and a correspondent practice are observed from the Grand Seignior down to the most petty Prince or Republic in Europe  You have sent me several papers some in print some in manuscript I think I had seen all of them except the formula of association I confess they appear to me to contain matter mischievous and capable of giving alarm if the spirit in which they are written should be found to make any considerable progress But I am at a loss to know how to apply them as objections  to the case now before us When I find that  the general committee  which acts for the Roman Catholics in Dublin prefers the association proposed in the written draft you have sent me to a respectful application in Parliament I shall think the persons who sign such a paper to be unworthy of any privilege which may be thought fit to be granted and that such men ought  by name  to be excepted from any benefit under the constitution to which they offer this violence But I do not find that this form of a seditious league has been signed by any person whatsoever either on the part of the supposed projectors or on the part of those whom it is calculated to seduce I do not find on enquiry that such a thing was mentioned or even remotely alluded to in the general meeting of the Catholics from which so much violence was apprehended I have considered the other publications signed by individuals on the part of certain societiesI may mistake for I have not the honour of knowing them personally but I take Mr Butler and Mr Tandy not to be Catholics but members of the established church Not  one  that I recollect of these publications which you and I equally dislike appears to be written by persons of that persuasion Now if whilst a man is dutifully soliciting a favour from Parliament any person  should chuse in an improper manner to shew his inclination towards the cause depending and if that  must  destroy the cause of the petitioner then not only the petitioner but the legislature itself is in the power of any weak friend or artful enemy that the supplicant or that the Parliament may have A man must be judged by his own actions only Certain Protestant Dissenters make seditious propositions to the Catholics which it does not appear that they have yet accepted It would be strange that the tempter should escape all punishment and that he who under circumstances full of seduction and full of provocation has resisted the temptation should incur the penalty You know that with regard to the Dissenters who are  stated  to be the chief movers in this vile scheme of altering the principles of election to a right of voting by the head you are not able if you ought even to wish such a thing to deprive them of any part of the franchises and privileges which they hold on a footing of perfect equality with yourselves  They  may do what they please with constitutional impunity but the others cannot even listen with civility to an invitation from them to an illjudged scheme of liberty without forfeiting for ever all hopes  of those liberties which we admit to be  rational  It is known I believe that the greater as well as the sounder part of our excluded countrymen have not adopted the wild ideas and wilder engagement which have been held out to them but have rather chosen to hope small and safe concessions from the legal power than boundless objects from trouble and confusion This mode of action seems to me to mark men of sobriety and to distinguish them from those who are intemperate from circumstance or from nature But why do they not instantly disclaim and disavow those who make such advances to them In this too in my opinion they shew themselves no less sober and circumspect In the present moment nothing short of insanity could induce them to take such a step Pray consider the circumstances Disclaim says somebody all union with the DissentersrightBut when this your injunction is obeyed shall I obtain the object which I solicit from youOh nonothing at all like itBut in punishing us by an exclusion from the constitution for having been invited to enter into it by a postern will you punish by deprivation of their privileges or mulct in any other way those who have tempted usFar from itwe mean to preserve all  their  liberties and immunities as  our  life blood We mean to cultivate  them  as brethren whom we love and respectwith  you  we have no fellowship We can bear with patience their enmity to ourselves but their friendship with you we will not endure But mark it well All our quarrels with  them  are always to be revenged upon you Formerly it is notorious that we should have resented with the highest indignation your presuming to shew any illwill to them You must not suffer them now to shew any goodwill to you Knowand take it once for allthat it is and ever has been and ever will be a fundamental maxim in our politics that you are not to have any part or shadow or name of interest whatever in our state That we look upon you as under an irreversible outlawry from our constitutionas perpetual and unalliable aliens  Such my dear Sir is the plain nature of the argument drawn from the revolution maxims enforced by a supposed disposition in the Catholics to unite with the Dissenters Such it is though it were clothed in never such bland and civil forms and wrapped up as a poet says in a thousand "artful folds of sacred lawn" For my own part I do not know in what manner to shape such arguments so as to obtain admission for them into a rational understanding  Every thing of this kind is to be reduced at last to threats of powerI cannot say  vae victis  and then throw the sword into the scale I have no sword and if I had in this case most certainly I would not use it as a makeweight in politic reasoning  Observe on these principles the difference between the procedure of the Parliament and the Dissenters towards the people in question One employs courtship the other force The Dissenters offer bribes the Parliament nothing but the  front negative  of a stern and forbidding authority A man may be very wrong in his ideas of what is good for him But no man affronts me nor can therefore justify my affronting him by offering to make me as happy as himself according to his own ideas of happiness This the Dissenters do to the Catholics You are on the different extremes The Dissenters offer with regard to constitutional rights and civil advantages of all sorts  every thing  you refuse  every thing  With them there is boundless tho' not very assured hope with you a very sure and very unqualified despair The terms of alliance from the Dissenters offer a representation of the Commons chosen out of the people by the head This is absurdly and dangerously  large in my opinion and that scheme of election is known to have been at all times perfectly odious to me But I cannot think it right of course to punish the Irish Roman Catholics by an universal exclusion because others whom you would not punish at all propose an universal admission I cannot dissemble to myself that in this very kingdom many persons who are not in the situation of the Irish Catholics but who on the contrary enjoy the full benefit of the constitution as it stands and some of whom from the effect of their fortunes enjoy it in a large measure had some years ago associated to procure great and undefined changes they considered them as reforms in the popular part of the constitution Our friend the late Mr Flood no slight man proposed in his place and in my hearing a representation not much less extensive than this for England in which every house was to be inhabited by a voter  in addition  to all the actual votes by other titlesall those some of the corporate which we know do not require a house or a shed Can I forget that a person of the very highest rank of very large fortune and of the first class of ability brought a bill into the House of Lords in the headquarters of aristocracy containing identically  the same project for the supposed adoption of which by a club or two it is thought right to extinguish all hopes in the Roman Catholics of Ireland I cannot say it was very eagerly embraced or very warmly pursued But the Lords neither did disavow the bill nor treat it with any disregard nor express any sort of disapprobation of its noble author who has never lost with king or people the least degree of the respect and consideration which so justly belongs to him  I am not at all enamoured as I have told you with this plan of representation as little do I relish any bandings or associations for procuring it But if the question was to be put to you and me  universal  popular representation or  none at all for us and ours  we should find ourselves in a very awkward position I don't like this kind of dilemmas especially when they are practical  Then since our oldest fundamental laws follow or rather couple freehold with franchise since no principle of the Revolution shakes these liberties since the oldest and one of the best monuments of the constitution demands for the Irish the privilege which they supplicate since the principles of the Revolution coincide with the declarations  of the Great Charter since the practice of the Revolution in this point did not contradict its principles since from that event twentyfive years had elapsed before a domineering party on a party principle had ventured to disfranchise without any proof whatsoever of abuse the greater part of the community since the King's coronation oath does not stand in his way to the performance of his duty to all his subjects since you have given to all other Dissenters these privileges without limit which are hitherto withheld without any limitation whatsoever from the Catholics since no nation in the world has ever been known to exclude so great a body of men not born slaves from the civil state and all the benefits of its constitution the whole question comes before Parliament as a matter for its prudence I do not put the thing on a question of right That discretion which in judicature is well said by Lord Coke to be a crooked cord in legislature is a golden rule Supplicants ought not to appear too much in the character of litigants If the subject thinks so highly and reverently of the sovereign authority as not to claim any thing of right that it may seem to be independent of its power and its free choice and the sovereign on his  part considers the advantages of the subjects as their right and all their reasonable wishes as so many claims in the fortunate conjunction of these mutual dispositions are laid the foundations of a happy and prosperous commonwealth For my own part desiring of all things that the authority of the legislature under which I was born and which I cherish not only with a dutiful awe but with a partial and cordial affection to be maintained in the utmost possible respect I never will suffer myself to suppose that at bottom their discretion will be found to be at variance with their justice  The whole being at discretion I beg leave just to suggest some matters for your considerationWhether the government in church or state is likely to be more secure by continuing causes of grounded discontent to a very great number say two millions of the subjects or Whether the constitution combined and balanced as it is will be rendered more solid by depriving so large a part of the people of all concern or interest or share in its representation actual or  virtual  I here mean to lay an emphasis on the word  virtual  Virtual representation is that in which there is a communion of ininterests  and a sympathy in feelings and desires between those who act in the name of any description of people and the people in whose name they act though the trustees are not actually chosen by them This is virtual representation Such a representation I think to be in many cases even better than the actual It possesses most of its advantages and is free from many of its inconveniences it corrects the irregularities in the literal representation when the shifting current of human affairs or the acting of public interests in different ways carry it obliquely from its first line of direction The people may err in their choice but common interest and common sentiment are rarely mistaken But this sort of virtual representation cannot have a long or sure existence if it has not a substratum in the actual The member must have some relation to the constituent As things stands the Catholic as a Catholic and belonging to a description has no  virtual  relation to the representative but the  contrary  There is a relation in mutual obligation Gratitude may not always have a very lasting power but the frequent recurrency for favours will revive and refresh it and will necessarily produce some degree of mutual attention It will produce  at least acquaintance the several descriptions of people will not be kept so much apart as if they were not only separate nations but separate species The stigma and reproach the hideous mask will be taken off and men will see each other as they are Sure I am that there have been thousands in Ireland who have never conversed with a Roman Catholic in their whole lives unless they happened to talk to their gardiner's workmen or to ask their way when they had lost it in their sports or at best who had known them only as footmen or other domestics of the second and third order and so averse were they some time ago to have them near their persons that they would not employ even those who could never find their way beyond the stable I well remember a great and in many respects a good man who advertised for a blacksmith but at the same time added he must be a Protestant It is impossible that such a state of things though natural goodness in many persons would undoubtedly make exceptions must not produce alienation on one side and pride and insolence on the other  Reduced to a question of discretion and that discretion exercised solely upon what will appear  best for the conservation of the state on its present basis I should recommend it to your serious thoughts whether the narrowing of the foundation is always the best way to secure the building The body of disfranchised men will not be perfectly satisfied to remain always in that state If they are not satisfied you have two millions of subjects in our bosom full of uneasiness not that they cannot overturn the act of settlement and put themselves and you under an arbitrary master or that they are not permitted to spawn an hydra of wild republics on principles of a pretended natural equality in man but because you will not suffer them to enjoy the ancient fundamental tried advantages of a British constitution that you will not permit them to profit of the protection of a common father or the freedom of common citizens and that the only reason which can be assigned for this disfranchisement has a tendency more deeply to ulcerate their minds than the act of exclusion itself What the consequence of such feelings must be it is for you to look to To warn is not to menace  I am far from asserting that men will not excite disturbances without just cause I know that such an assertion is not true But neither  is it true that disturbances have never just complaints for their origin I am sure that it is hardly prudent to furnish them with such causes of complaint as every man who thinks the British constitution a benefit may think at least colourable and plausible  Several are in dread of the manoeuvres of certain persons among the Dissenters who turn this ill humour to their own ill purposes You know better than I can how much these proceedings of certain among the Dissenters are to be feared You are to weigh with the temper which is natural to you whether it may be for the safety of our establishment that the Catholics should be ultimately persuaded that they have no hope to enter into the constitution but through the Dissenters  Think whether this be the way to prevent or dissolve factious combinations against the church or the state Reflect seriously on the possible consequences of keeping in the heart of your country a bank of discontent every hour accumulating upon which every description of seditious men may draw at pleasure They whose principles of faction would dispose  them to the establishment of an arbitrary monarchy will find a nation of men who have no sort of interest in freedom but who will have an interest in that equality of justice or favour with which a wise despot must view all his subjects who do not attack the foundations of his power Love of liberty itself may in such men become the means of establishing an arbitrary domination On the other hand they who wish for a democratic republic will find a set of men who have no choice between civil servitude and the entire ruin of a mixed constitution  Suppose the people or Ireland divided into three parts of these I speak within compass two are Catholic Of the remaining third one half is composed of Dissenters There is no natural union between those descriptions It may be produced If the two parts Catholic be driven into a close confederacy with half the third part of Protestants with a view to a change in the constitution in church or state or both and you rest the whole of their security on a handful of gentlemen clergy and their dependants compute the strength  you have in Ireland  to oppose to grounded discontent to capricious innovation to blind popular fury and to ambitious  turbulent intrigue You mention that the minds of some gentlemen are a good deal heated and that it is often said that rather than submit to such persons having a share in their franchises they would throw up their independence and precipitate an union with Great Britain  I have heard a discussion concerning such an union amongst all sorts of men ever since I remember any thing For my own part I have never been able to bring my mind to any thing clear and decisive upon the subject There cannot be a more arduous question As far as I can form an opinion it would not be for the mutual advantage of the two kingdoms but persons more able than I am think otherwise But whatever the merits of this union may be to make it a  menace  it must be shewn to be an  evil  and an evil more particularly to those who are threatened with it than to those who hold it out as a terror I really do not see how this threat of an union can operate or that the Catholics are more likely to be losers by that measure than the churchmen  The humours of the people and of politicians too are so variable in themselves and are so  much under the occasional influence of some leading men that it is impossible to know what turn the public mind here would take in such an event There is but one thing certain concerning it that this union would excite a strong ferment on both sides of the water with strong animosities and violent passions whilst the arrangement continued in agitation Great divisions and vehement passions would precede this union both on the measure itself and on its terms and particularly this very question of a share in the representation for the Catholics from whence the project of an union originated would form a principal part in the discussion and in the temper in which some gentlemen seem inclined to throw themselves by a sort of high indignant passion into the scheme those points would not be deliberated with all possible calmness  From my best observation I should greatly doubt whether in the end these gentlemen would obtain their object so as to make the exclusion of two millions of their countrymen a fundamental article in the union The demand would be of a nature quite unprecedented You might obtain the union and yet a gentleman  who under the new union establishment wou'd aspire to the honour of representing his county might possibly be as much obliged as he may fear to be under the old separate establishment to the unsupportable mortification of asking his neighbours who have a different opinion concerning the elements in the sacrament for their votes  I believe nay I am sure that the people of Great Britain with or without an union might be depended upon in cases of any real danger to aid the government of Ireland with the same cordiality as they would support their own against any wicked attempts to shake the security of the happy constitution in church and state But before Great Britain engages in any quarrel the  cause of the dispute  would certainly be a part of her consideration If confusions should arise in that kingdom from too steady an attachment to a proscriptive monopolizing system and from the resolution of regarding the franchise and in it the security of the subject as belonging rather to religious opinions than to civil qualification and civil conduct I doubt whether you might quite certainly reckon on obtaining an aid of force from hence for the support of that system We might extend your distractions  to this country by taking part in them England will be indisposed I suspect to send an army for the conquest of Ireland What was done in is a decisive proof of her sentiments of justice and moderation She will not be fond of making another American war in Ireland The principles of such a war would but too much resemble the former one The welldisposed and the illdisposed in England would for different reasons perhaps be equally averse to such an enterprize The confiscations the public auctions the private grants the plantations the transplantations which formerly animated so many adventurers even among sober citizens to such Irish expeditions and which possibly might have animated some of them to the American can have no existence in the case that we suppose  Let us form a supposition no foolish or ungrounded supposition that in an age when men are infinitely more disposed to heat themselves with political than religious controversies the former should entirely prevail as we see that in some places they have prevailed over the latter and that the Catholics of Ireland from the courtship paid them on the one hand and the  high tone of refusal on the other should in order to enter into all the rights of subjects all become Protestant Dissenters and as the others do take all your oaths They would all obtain their civil objects and the change for any thing I know to the contrary in the dark as I am about the Protestant Dissenting tenets might be of use to the health of their souls But what security our constitution in church or state could derive from that event I cannot possibly discern Depend upon it it is as true as nature is true that if you force them out of the religion of habit education or opinion it is not to yours they will ever go Shaken in their minds they will go to that where the dogmas are fewest where they are the most uncertain where they lead them the least to a consideration of what they have abandoned They will go to that uniformly democratic system to whose first movements they owed their emancipation I recommend you seriously to turn this in your mind Believe that it requires your best and maturest thoughts Take what course you pleaseunion or no union whether the people remain Catholics or become Protestant Dissenters sure it is that the present state of monopoly  cannot  continue  If England were animated as I think she is not with her former spirit of domination and with the strong theological hatred which she once cherished for that description of her fellowchristians and fellowsubjects I am yet convinced that after the fullest success in a ruinous struggle you would be obliged finally to abandon that monopoly We were obliged to do this even when every thing promised success in the American business If you should make this experiment at last under the pressure of any necessity you never can do it well But if instead of falling into a passion the leading gentlemen of the country themselves should undertake the business cheerfully and with hearty affection towards it great advantages would follow What is forced cannot be modified but here you may measure your concessions  It is a consideration of great moment that you may make the desired admission without altering the system of your representation in the smallest degree or in any part You may leave that deliberation of a parliamentary change or reform if ever you should think fit to engage in it uncomplicated and unembarrassed with the other question Whereas if they are mixed  and confounded as some people attempt to mix and confound them no one can answer for the effects on the constitution itself  There is another advantage in taking up this business singly and by an arrangement for the single object It is that you may proceed by  degrees  We must all obey the great law of change it is the most powerful law of nature and the means perhaps of its conservation All we can do and that human wisdom can do is to provide that the change shall proceed by insensible degrees This has all the benefits which may be in change without any of the inconveniences of mutation Every thing is provided for as it arrives This mode will on the one hand prevent the  unfixing old interests at once  a thing which is apt to breed a black and sullen discontent in those who are at once dispossessed of all their influence and consideration This gradual course on the other side will prevent men long under depression from being intoxicated with a large draught of new power which they always abuse with a licentious insolence But wishing as I do the change to be gradual and cautious I would in my first steps lean rather to the side of enlargement than restriction  It is one excellence of our constitution that all our rights of election regard rather property than person The standard may be so low or not so judiciously chosen as in some degree to frustrate the end But all this is for your prudence in the case before you You may rise a step or two the qualification of the Catholic voters But if you were tomorrow to put the Catholic freeholder on the footing of the most favoured fortyshilling Protestant Dissenter you know that such is the actual state of Ireland this would not make a sensible alteration in almost any  one  election in the kingdom The effect in their favour even defensively would be infinitely slow But it would be healing it would be satisfactory and protecting The stigma would be removed By admitting settled permanent substance in lieu of the numbers you would avoid the great danger of our time that of setting up number against property The numbers ought never to be neglected because besides what is due to them as men collectively though not individually they have great property they ought to have therefore protection they ought to have security they ought to have even consideration but they ought not to predominate  My dear Sir I have nearly done I meant to write you a long letter I have written a long dissertation I might have done it early and better I might have been more forcible and more clear if I had not been interrupted as I have been and this obliges me not to write to you in my own hand Though my hand but signs it my heart goes with what I have written Since I could think at all those have been my thoughts You know that thirtytwo years ago they were as fully matured in my mind as they are now A letter of mine to Lord Kenmare though not by my desire and full of lesser mistakes has been printed in Dublin It was written ten or twelve years ago at the time when I began the employment which I have not yet finished in favour of another distressed people injured by those who have vanquished them or stolen a dominion over them It contained my sentiments then you will see how far they accord with my sentiments now Time has more and more confirmed me in them all The present circumstances fix them deeper in my mind  I voted last session if a particular vote could be distinguished in unanimity for an establishment  of the Church of England  conjointly  with the establishment which was made some years before by act of parliament of the Roman Catholic in the French conquered country of Canada At the time of making this English ecclesiastical establishment we did not think it necessary for its safety to destroy the former Gallican church settlement In our first act we settled a government altogether monarchical or nearly so In that system the Canadian Catholics were far from being deprived of the advantages or distinctions of any kind which they enjoyed under their former monarchy It is true that some people and amongst them one eminent divine predicted at that time that by this step we should lose our dominions in America He foretold that the Pope would send his indulgences thither that the Canadians would fall in with France declare their independence and draw or force our colonies into the same design The independence happened according to his prediction but in directly the reverse order All our English Protestant colonies revolted They joined themselves to France and it so happened that Popish Canada was the only place which preserved its fidelity the only place in which France got no footing the only  peopled colony which now remains to Great Britain Vain are all the prognostics taken from ideas and passions which survive the state of things which give rise to them When last year we gave a popular representation to the same Canada by the choice of the landholders and an aristocratic representation at the choice of the crown neither was the choice of the crown nor the election of the landholders limited by a consideration of religion We had no dread for the Protestant church which we settled there because we permitted the French Catholics in the utmost latitude of the description to be free subjects They are good subjects I have no doubt but I will not allow that any French Canadian Catholics are better men or better citizens than the Irish of the same communion Passing from the extremity of the west to the extremity almost of the east I have been many years now entering into the twelfth employed in supporting the rights privileges laws and immunities of a very remote people I have not as yet been able to finish my task I have struggled through much discouragement and much opposition much obloquy much calumny for a people with whom I have no tie but the common bond of mankind In this  I have not been left alone We did not sly from our undertaking because the people were Mahometans or Pagans and that a great majority of the Christians amongst them were Papists Some gentlemen in Ireland I dare say have good reasons for what they may do which do not occur to me I do not presume to condemn them but thinking and acting as I have done towards these remote nations I should not know how to shew my face here or in Ireland if I should say that all the Pagans all the Mussulmen and even Papists since they must form the highest stage in the climax of evil are worthy of a liberal and honourable condition except those of one of the descriptions which forms the majority of the inhabitants of the country in which you I and were born If such are the Catholics of Ireland illnatured and unjust people from our own data may be inclined not to think better of the Protestants of a soil which is supposed to infuse into its sects a kind of venom unknown in other places  You hated the old system as early as I did Your first juvenile lance was broken against that giant I think you were even the first who attacked the grim phantom You have an exceeding  good understanding very good humour and the best heart in the world The dictates of that temper and that heart as well as the policy pointed out by that understanding led you to abhor the old code You abhorred it as I did for its vicious perfection For I must do it justice it was a complete system full of coherence and consistency well digested and well composed in all its parts It was a machine of wise and elaborate contrivance and as well fitted for the oppression impoverishment and degradation of a people and the debasement in them of human nature itself as ever proceeded from the perverted ingenuity of man It is a thing humiliating enough that we are doubtful of the effect of the medicines we compound We are sure of our poisons My opinion ever was in which I heartily agreed with those that admired the old code that it was so constructed that if there was once a breach in any essential part of it the ruin of the whole or nearly of the whole was at some time or other a certainty For that reason I honour and shall for ever honour and love you and those who first caused it to stagger crack and gapeOthers may finish the beginners have the glory and take what part you please  at this hour I think you will take the best your first services will never be forgotten by a grateful country Adieu Present my best regards to those I know and as many as I know in our country I honour There never was so much ability or I believe virtue in it They have a task worthy of both I doubt not they will perform it for the stability of the church and state and for the union and the separation of the people for the union of the honest and peaceable of all sects for their separation from all that is illintentioned and seditious in any of them  BEACONSFIELD  January    FINIS
