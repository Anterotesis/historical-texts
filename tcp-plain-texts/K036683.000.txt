PaterNoster Row  Price s  TO EUSTACE BUDGELL  Esq  SIR  _THOSE who devote themselves to POETRY have but one Way of paying the highest Favours their Returns are only the Fruits of that Art which they cultivate and they might well bewail this as a Partiality in Nature were not the Gifts of Genius sometimes beyond those of Fortune Men who like your Self can give Eternity to Names they honour have no Reason to complain of the Muses But such as we who have it in our  Wills to be grateful and are shorten'd in the only Powers we have to shew it feel greater Uneasiness from Obligations than is easy to be express'd In such a Situation we have nothing left but our Attempts to please and these your superior Geniuses must look upon rather as a Homage than a Return the Effects of our good Wishes rather than the Accomplishment of our Desires  NEXT to being eminent in one's own Character to be distinguish'd by Men of Excellence is the happiest Praise and as one of these is very often introductory to the other so has it happen'd to you the  Greatest Men  among us first observ'd and cherish'd your Merit and you soon return'd the Acknowledgment by making that Merit useful and ornamental to your Country What a noble Testimony do your living Virtues give to the Discernment of the late Lord  HALIFAX  that Great Man had the peculiar Happiness of  making Wit and Learning not only a Qualification for his Friendship but of Service to the Business and Management of publick Affairs The Familiarity you have always entertain'd with the first Men of Letters and the Applause with which you have acted and still continue to act in the Sphere of Business are equally to your Honour and have set your Character as much above Flattery as Detraction  FOR my Part it has always been my Ambition to desire the good Opinion of Men of your Turn and I never have or shall be asham'd of publishing the Virtues of those who have been eminent in their Services for our KING Country and Legal Constitution and in this View if any Thing of mine can reach so far would I be look'd upon by Posterity  IN the mean Time I cannot but congratulate my Country for breeding such gallant free Spirits who  like your Self have rose up in Opposition to the two most implacable Powers that can be let loose upon Mankind  Tyranny  and  Popery  It is your Praise Sir to have acted a most noble Part on this Account in the  Irish Senate  a Country more than once the Scene of the most dreadful Massacres but now by the Actions of YOU and your fellow PATRIOTS happily recover'd from the same threat'ning and oh too near impending Persecution  SUCH publick Services as these tho' they give Joy and Blessings to a whole Nation yet they more nearly affect those who have a Share in your Esteem Among the great Number that your Merit have made your Friends I am proud to be accounted one and to have it known to the World I had your Permission to prefix your Name to this TRAGEDY I shall be very negligent with the Criticks and set my Heart at Rest on Account of the Envious  if it has the good Fortune in the least to please and divert one Hour of your Retirement It comes to you with sincere Wishes for a happy  NewYear  for a long and uninterrupted Health and that you may remain what now you are an Ornament to the Post you fill and Blessing to the Nation you are happily planted in are the hearty Wishes and Prayers of  SIR  Your most oblig'd And most obedient Humble Servant  Susanna Cent Livre  PROLOGUE  Spoken by Mr WILKS  By Mr SEWELL  THIS  Play  I wonder how the Thing could hold  Is if I reckon right two Winters old  It should have courted you the last hard Frost  But you in  Ice  and  Politicks  were lost  Two slipp'ry  Things  Some know it to their Cost  The prudent Mother therefore with good Reason  Wean'd not this Child before a better Season  Wellpleas'd sne sees the Madness of the Age  Spent in an Impotent Successless Rage  From civil Life transfer your Horrors  here  And give to  Tragedy  its proper Sphere  Our  Woman  says for 'tis a  Woman  's Wit  That  single Word  will gain us half the  Pit    This is her first Attempt in  TragickStuff  And here's  Intrigue  and  Plot  and  Love  enough  The Devil's in it if the  Sex  can't write  Those Things in which  They  take the most Delight  If she has touch'd these  Scenes  with artful Care  Be kind and all her smaller Failings spare  The  Ladies  sure will ease a  Woman  's Fears  For common Pity's Sake the  Men  for Thiers  On Hopes like these her  Tragedy  depends  Not on confed'rate Clubs of clapping Friends  Dispos'd in Parties to support her Cause  And bully you by Noise into Applause  If she must sue she scorns those vulgar Arts  But fain by nobler Means would win your  Hearts  Tell you she wears her Country in her Breast  And is as firmly  Loyal  as the  best  Then bid your  Hearts  their kindest Pray'rs convey  And meet your coming MONARCH on his Way  Who from one peaceful Journey brings us more  Than our long List of conq'ring KINGS before  For ne'er did  Britain  's Hopes so highly Tower  Or promise such a glorious Stretch of Power  As on that Day which shall to Council bring  The  Bravest Senate  and the Greatest KING  Whose rip'ning Schemes shall distant Nation's Rule  Make  Tyrants  tremble and  Divans  grow cool  To  Britain  's Ensigns then as They decree  The World shall strike by  Land  as well as  Seae  Dramatis Personae  MEN  KING of  Lombardy  Mr  Mills  Duke of  Milan  disguis'd like an  Hermit  Mr  Boman  LORENZO General of  Lombardy  privately marry'd to  Leonora  Mr  Booth  ANTENOR Prime Minister of State Father to  Learchus  Mr  Quin  LEARCHUS Keeper of the  Royal Fort  in Love with  Antimora  Mr  Ryan  CARDONO Friend to LORENZO and his LieutenantGeneral  Mr  Walker  AGONISTUS Friend to LEARCHUS  Mr  Wilks  WOMEN  LEONORA Princess of  Lombardy  Mrs  Oldfield  ANTIMORA in Love with LEARCHUS  Mrs  Porter  Embassadors Captain Guards Ladies and other Attendants  SCENE the City of VERONA in  Lombardy  THE CRUEL GIFT OR THE Royal Resentment  ACT I  SCENE the PALACE  Enter  Antenor  and  Learchus  ANTENOR  AWAY 'tis all Romantick  The lazy Virtue of some dreaming Hermit  Far be Ambition from their homely Cells  But what hast thou to do with illtim'd Honesty  Observe me well and treasure in thy Soul  The experienc'd Wisdom of thy Father  Let Interest be thy bright unerring Guide  The secret darling Purpose of thy Heart  Believe me Boy she reigns Supreme below  Honours and endless Pleasure wait around her  When she commands smile on the Man thou hatest  Caress him to inevitable Ruin  From foolish Pity guard thy welltaught Mind  To Women leave the fond Deceiver Love  That Bar to Glory and to great Revenge  Think not of Friendship more than of a Word  Which once gone forth is lost in idle Air  Lear  Is this the Language of Paternal Love  Forbid it all good Men that I should think so  You mean to prove my Soul and 'tis most just  For many wear the borrow'd Mask of Goodness  But I was made in Scorn of Artifice  Superior Virtue is my awful Goddess  My pleasing Motive and my wish'd Reward  Whether she leads me to the active Field  Or the more dangerous Court she guides my Life  Fame Honour Wealth when by her Hand bestow'd  With grateful Joy submissive I'll receive them  But offer'd by the World in Lieu of her  With Scorn I'd throw them back as empty Trifles  Unworthy of an honest Man's Regard  Ante  Dull Moralist hast thou no Taste of Power  No Thirst of Glory No ambitious Longings  To raise thy Soul and bear thee up to Empire  And can'st thou let  Lorenzo  tower above thee  Call to Remembrance all thy noble Ancestors  Who all fell Victims to the Rage of his  Consider this then think if thou art injur'd  Enough to prompt thee to a great Revenge  Lear  Far be the Thought of Vengeance from my Soul  I view with equal Justice Friends and Enemies  Pride may perhaps pronounce This Weakness in me  No Matter what the haughty Mind suggests  I'd rather wear the Name of Good than Great  Ante  Why this is finely said  Lear  For  Lorenzo  since my Royal Master  Whose great undoubted Right has Power to give  Bestow'd on him the Honours which I wore  Long may they slourish with him who shall dare  Blame you in giving or resuming Favours  Then ought we Sir t' impose on Majesty  What in our selves we would not bear  Ante  Go on go on pursue this darling Vapour  Unthinking to what Precipice it leads  Extol  Lorenzo  dwell upon his Praise  And help to swell the popular Applause  Forget the Conquests that have crown'd thy Valour  The numerous Wounds thou hast sustain'd in Battel  For this insulting this ungrateful King  Lear  Wore not my Sword the Freedom of my Country  Wounds lose their Smart in such a glorious Cause  He who for Interest or for base Revenge  Should in a private Quarrel sell his Foe  Deserves the Scorn of every good Man for't  But he who would enslave his native Land  Give up the reverend Rights of Law and Justice  To the detested Lust of boundless Tyranny  Pollute our Altars change our holy Worship  Deserves the Curses both of Heaven and Earth  And from Society of human Kind  To be cast forth among the Beasts of Prey  A Monster far more savage  Ante  Excellent  Lear  For me  I know no Glory but my Country's Good  Nor Anger bear 'gainst any but her Foes  But all her Enemies are mine for her  I'd make this Body one entire Scar  Ere I would see my Country made a Prey  Or know the King to whom I've sworn distress'd  And this I hold to be all brave Mens Duty  Ante  Matchless Stupidity  Art thou from me from my strong Blood deriv'd  And can thy ebbing Pulses beat so low  So distant from the Vigour of my Soul  But Spite of Artifice I see quite thro' thee  Ill dost thou hide from me the hated Cause  Of this tame Suffering this Bastard Patience  Deaf to Ambition foolish Love betrays thee  Lorenzo  's Sister  Antimora  reigns  The pow'rful Mistress o'er thy Heart and Fame  Thy easy Mind fond of the slavish Yoke  Forgets her haughty Brother soars above thee  I bad thee lift thine Eyes to  Leonora  The beauteous Hope of this fair Kingdom  Lear  Yes that guilty Thought of yours undid me  Oh was it not that finding your Ambition  The angry King to scatter all your Hopes  Ruin'd guiltless me  Ante  Well I remember his ungrateful Rage  Remember it with just Indignation  And thou as soon might'st think to reconcile  Th' eternal Quarrel between Death and Nature  As quench my eager Thirst of Vengeance  Yet I dissembled well my Injuries  And sooth'd the fiery King with so much Art  The bold Proposal was mistook for Zeal  To keep the beauteous  Leonora  with us  'Twas thus the Monarch's Favour I regain'd  His wanting this experienc'd Head for Council  When that old Sophister  Alcanor  dy'd  I rose again prime Minister of State  And now have in my View a brave Design  Of which thou art unworthy to partake  Lear  My Want of Merit is my Pride in this  For where Revenge and Fraud are of the Party  I would not be admitted  Ante  You wou'd not Sir  But tho' Crowns and Pow'r want Charms to move thee  And Injury seems to have lost her pointed Sting  When thou shalt know that  Antimora  's given  A Pledge of Friendship from her Brother's Hand  To his dear Fav'rite and FellowWarrior  I know thy Spirits will be all awake  Lear  Ha  Ante  Yes that dang'rous Maid who has misled thee  For whom all filial Duty is forgot  All Wrongs forgiven all Ambition quench'd  Must be  Cardono  's Wife  Lear  I know  Lorenzo  loves the Man you mention  But that he is to wed fair  Antimora  Is all a Dream work'd up by waking Malice  The Souls of Martyrs mounting from the Flame  Are not more brightly spotless than her Faith  But you have Leave to say whate'er you please  And I unruffl'd will with Calmness hear you  Ante  Go on young Stoick bless these Pair of Friends  Go bend thy Knee to this young Fav'rite low  Resign thy Mistress to the other's Arms  And be renown'd for Patience  Lear  When I do that let Infamy and Shame  Pursue and blot the Name of Soldier from me  Give up my Mistress quit the Maid I love  As soon I would give up my Post in War  Resign the Soul which animates this Frame  And to that latest Nothing be reduc'd  Where Love and Glory ceaseBut oh I rave  Her Brother's Pow'r no not the King's Command  Can shock her Faith  Ante  Build not thy Hopes upon a Woman's Faith  But join with me and greatly be reveng'd  I have the Means  Lorenzo  's in my Snare  Deep as the Grave I've trac'd his erring Steps  And seen him safe within the Toils of Fate  Once more I warn thee to throw off thy Love  Wake from this idle Amorous Lethargy  And shun that falling House like Loss of Honour  Exert thy Soul and aid my great Design  Or from this Moment thou'rt no more my Son  Ex  Lear  Wou'd I indeed were not unhappy Thought  Enter  Agonistus    My  Agonistus    Oh much I wanted thee and thou art come  Even to share Misfortunes with thy Friend  Thou kind thou best Companion of my Youth  Thou Partner in my Dangers well I know thee  Should Father King and ev'ry Star frown on me  Thou would'st not forsake me  Ag  Much sooner shall this fertile Kingdom change  Her happy pregnant Soil for sterile Sand  Than I sorsake my FriendCome be not sad  Thou wilt again regain thy Master's Favour  Lear  Thou know'st me not  Il' thou dost think I in the least regard  Whom Fortune mounts upon her giddy Wheel  Or o'er what Fav'rite she insulting drives  A softer Care does all my Thoughts employ  Love  Agonistus  is the fatal Source  From whence my Sorrows spring  Ag  I've guess'd it long  But knew not to what Fair your Vows were paid  Lear  Now I will tell thee all th' important Story  And ease my burthen'd Heart of half its Load  Thou art well acquainted with that ancient Hate  Between  Lorenzo  's Family and mine  And must remember to have heard at least  His Grandfather when overpower'd by Faction  From Court exil'd pass'd many Years in  Venice  During which Time his Son the Lord  Alcanor  Marry'd a beautiful  Venetian  Lady  And he had Issue by her this  Lorenzo  And  Antimora  of whom she dy'd in Childbed  Soon after this his Father also dy'd  Alcanor  strait employ'd his Friends t' obtain  Leave from the King for his Return to  Lombardy  The King gave Leave he came and liv'd obscurely  In sullen Solitude and haughty Privacy  Ag  I do remember to have heard this Story  Lear  In a lone ancient Seat  Alcanor  liv'd  Hard by a Castle which belong'd to us  'Twas there I first beheld fair  Antimora  And gazing catch'd and gather'd growing Love  Bright as a  Sylvan  Goddess she appear'd  And shot her beauteous Beams into my Soul  In some Disguise I waited every Day  'Till in one happy Ev'ning I at last  Met her as she was walking forth alone  With trembling Awe I ventur'd to approach her  And on my Knees I begg'd that she would hear  The truest Passion that e'er warm'd a Lover  Ag  And she consented  Lear  At first she heard with Caution still objecting  Our Houses Hatred and my prosp'rous Fate  And charg'd me to suppress the growing Flame  And fix my Choice on some more happy Maid  Whose ample Fortunes and whose equal Merit  Might vindicate my Love  Ag  Thus Minds form'd truly great bear up their Port  Lear  But still I press'd and told the lovely Fair one  My wakeful restless Agonies of Heart  My eager Fondness and my growing Fears  The Pains of Doubt and Horror of Despair  With every Care which racks a Lover's Breast  At length the Ardor of my servent Vows  Drew from her snowy Bosom unawares  A pitying Sigh and from her Eyes a Tear  The rich Reward of many anxious Minutes  At last she spoke and bless'd me with this Promise  If there be yet a smiling Hour behind  That shall the Grandeur of our House restore  You who have lov'd me in this Ebb of Fortune  Shall find a grateful Sense in  Antimora  Ag  She is indeed a Miracle of Goodness  Lear  She gave me Leave to see her every Day  But soon alas my Father's waking Jealousy  Discover'd where my constant Vows were paid  And urg'd the King I might be sent Abroad  The  Turkish  War concluded just before  And  Lombardy  was by this Arm in Peace  And 'cause no warlike Expedition offer'd  I bore a peaceful Embassy to  Rome  Before I went I saw the lovely Maid  And told her all the Cunning of my Father  With all the Trouble of my Soul at Parting  She bid me go and said it was my Duty  To serve my King in Peace as well as War  Then breath'd a Sigh and promis'd to be faithful  'Twas thus we parted Soon after I was gone  Oh  Agonistus  fain I would forget it  My Father all our Letters intercepted  And blinded with the daz'ling Lustre of a Throne  Rais'd his ambitious Thoughts to  Leonora  And dar'd to ask her for my Services  Ag  Unlucky Thought  Lear  Oh most abhorr'd Ambition  For this my Father was displac'd from Court  And Lord  Alcanor  grew again in Favour  The  Tuscan  War about that Time broke out  When this  Lorenzo  this young RivalWarrior  Had first the Honour to command our Forces  He rose in Favour whilst I set in Shame  Ag  Swiftly he rose as if the Goddess  Fortune  Became enamour'd with his many Graces  No sooner seen but all her Smiles were on him  Lear  For this I was recall'd disgrac'd upbraided ruin'd  And banish'd from the Sight of  Antimora  Beneath her Window wet with baleful Dew  All Night I lay and told each Star my Grief  She prais'd my Change confess'd the Prince's Charms  And all Access deny'd to wretched me  'Till Love long tortur'd on the Rack of Grief  Convinc'd her of my muchwrong'd Innocence  She smil'd and bid me hope a better Day  But oh what Day can I expect to see  If what my Father told me now be true  Cardono  weds the beauteous  Antimora  But haste my Friend tell her  Learchus  dies  When e'er she makes that hated Rival happy  Ag  I fly but see the Friends appear  Lear  Ha how quick my Spirits move I'm all on Fire  What headstrong Rage does Jealousy inspire  This is the Court safe from unhallow'd Strife  When next we meet guard well that hated Life  Thou shalt dispute my  Antimora  's Charms  And through this Breast make Passage to her Arms  Ex  Enter  Lorenzo  and  Cardono  Lor  Was that  Learchus  parted hence  Card  It was  Lor  They say his Mind is rich in ev'ry Virtue  A Stranger to his Father's canker'd Malice  And of a friendly Nature yet I know not  Something there is that whispers to my Soul  Beware that Race  Card  Oh most Prophetick Thought  Teach  Antimora  to beware it too  Forgive my Fears Lovers have watchful Eyes  Or I mistake or he is much too happy  Lor  The Error of thy Fondness nothing more  She is the Daughter of Antipathy  Nurs'd up in Hate to that invet'rate House  And like my self unalterable  Card  Fain oh very fain would I believe thee  My Hopes are center'd in that blooming Maid  And Life without her is not worth my Care  Yet when I speak of my excessive Passion  To me she seems more cold than MountainSnow  And hears with Unconcern what e'er I say  But if by Chance some one  Learchus  name  A conscious Blush o'erspreads her Face and strait  She turns away to hide the rising Joy  Lor  Sure my Friend thou dost mistake her Looks  That bold Aspirer most abhorr'd  Antenor  Once dar'd to ask the Princess for his Son  Oh were it but for that presumptuous Guilt  I'd sooner wed my Sister to Dishonour  To Misery or Death than to  Learchus  But see she comes as I appointed her  I mean by gentle Means to aid thy Suit  Card  The Powers above assist thee  Enter  Antimora  Ant  Cardono  with him Oh my boading Heart  aside  Card  Who can describe the Lovers painful Pleasure  At the Approach of his enchanting Fair  Anti  I come to know my dearest Brother's Will  Lor  Come nearer Sister why dost tremble so  Hast thou a Cause for Fear my  Antimora  Anti  I hope I need not fear my gentle Brother  Whilst you are safe from Wars destructive Rage  And bless me with your Smiles I have no Fear  Lor  Am I then dear to thee tell me my Sister  Anti  Dear as my Life my Virtue or my Fame  You are the fondest truest best of Brothers  Tender and careful as a Guardian Angel  Since gracious Heaven took my Father from me  Thy kind Indulgence has supply'd his Care  That Providence may crown thy Hopes and Wishes  Is each returning Morn my first Request  Lor  If thou would'st have me credit these fond Accents  Which more if possible endear thee to me  Look on  Cardono  on this suffring Youth  Who treasures all his future Hopes in thee  Pity his Sorrows and prevent his Fate  And if no other Merit reach thy Knowledge  Remember that he is my Friend  Anti  That speaks him of a noble Nature Sir  And I shall still regard him with Esteem  Card  Too weak a Cordial to my fainting Heart  That sickens with Despair  aside  Lor  Esteem Think I prithee what I owe him  And help me to discharge the mighty Debt  Oft in the Field he has my Life preserv'd  When warm'd with Slaughter I have rush'd too far  And plung'd my self amongst my thickest Foes  Hem'd round with Death and yet he broke thro' all  Resolv'd to rescue or to perish with me  Anti  Superior Virtue cannot miss Reward  Lor  Thou must reward him Sister yes thou must  If I have any Interest in thy Breast  If I have well obey'd our Father's Charge  And been a Father to thee or if thou  Hast not forgot his dying last Command  Never to wed without my Approbation  Then if thoud'st know me happy make him so  Anti  Forbear thou kind Protector of my Youth  Forbear to wound thy  Antimora  thus  Nor vainly ask what I can never grant  There was a Time you would have sought my Peace  Give me not Cause to think you love me less  Lor  Thou'rt dearer to me than the Smiles of Kings  My Hopes of Glory or immortal Fame  And therefore 'tis that I would place thee here  Safe in the Arms of this deserving Man  Who merits and who fondly loves thee  Anti  Think you my Lord  Cardono  this the Way  Use you Authority to gain your Wishes  Power may dispose of Life but rest assur'd  A gen'rous Mind can never be compell'd  Card  Alas my Friend your Kindness has undone me  Lor  Take heed my Sister how you wake mine Anger  Which will like Light'ning blast thy unwary Soul  Is there a Form thy erring Choice prefers  To this brave Man My Rage will find him out  And hurl a swift Destruction on his Head  Nay do not weep Tears will avail thee nothing  Can it be possible thou shouldst forget  From whence thou art and listen to  Learchus  The Son of that vile Parricide  Antenor  Detested Thought  Anti  Oh wretched  Antimora  Lor  Ha dar'st thou to sigh for him degen'rate Wretch  Then hear me Madam and observe me well  Teach thy fond Heart t'accept the proffer'd Good  Or from thy Disobedience date long Woe  Affection shall give Place to vow'd Severity  Unseen unnam'd unpity'd shalt thou live  And waste the tedious Hours in vain Remorse  Nor will I ever hold Discourse with thee  But to upbraid thy Weakness  Anti  Oh my Brother my only Friend on Earth  kneels  Recal those Words those dreadful hasty Words  And rather kill me any other Way  Card  Oh hold  Lorenzo  I can bear no more  raises her  Jealousy Disappointments and Despair  Are Joys to what my Heart this Moment feels  She must have Ease whatever comes of me  Anti  Where have you lost your wonted Tenderness  Think if our dearest Father now were living  And should impose such harsh Commands on you  Against your Inclination charge you wed  Or if like me you lov'd where Tyes of Duty  Make that Love a Crime what would you do  Lor  She touches me indeedPrithee comply  Anti  If  Antimora  may have Leave to plead  If I have yet a Place in your Esteem  If from your Breast you have not raz'd me quite  Give to my throbbing Heart a little Time  To weigh the many Cares which hang upon it  And I must beg that you my Lord  Cardono  No longer would insist upon his Power  Urge not a Cause that may increase Debate  Between the kindest most united Pair  That e'er one Mother bore  Card  Severe Request but I obey  Lor  Take thy Desire my Sister but remember  That if you wou'd preserve a Brother's Love  Let not the Woman sway thee to thy Ruin  Go then I say and summon all thy Reason  Direct the Ballance with an even Hand  Consider Duty Honour Gratitude  Are poiz'd against that Trifle Inclination  Then let Impartial Judgment guide thy Choice  Tear from thy Virgin Breast th' inglorious Passion  If thou regard'st thy own or Brother's Fame  Car  Remember my Despair for the same Breath  Which makes him happy gives me certain Death  Ex  Lorenzo  and  Cardono  Anti  What dire malignant Planet rul'd my Fate  Why was I born to Love where I should hate  Where I should hate No I should all Things Love  Such are the Dictates of the Powers above  Then what they teach they surely will defend  On their great Care shall all my Hopes depend  To crown my Love or give my Life an End  Exit  Enter  Antenor  and hears her last Words  Ante  Curse on thy Brother how I hate his Sight  Yet like his evil Genius I pursue him  I have alarm'd the King that Work is o'er  And now th' Embassadors from  Tuscany  Pursuant to the Advice I sent that Duke  Bring with them Propositions for a Marriage  And with unweary'd Diligence attend  And watch those Steps which bring his Ruin on  Between that Prince and  Leonora  To Day they have their Audience of the King  Methinks it suits my Purpose well  But see the King appears  Enter KING  King  Where art thou hid  Antenor  When most I want thee thou dost shun me most  I like it not  Ant  What would my gracious Lord  King  Thou hast convey'd a Sting into my Breast  Which still the more I labour to draw forth  With double Anguish deeper points its Way  What dost thou know that has so greatly mov'd thee  T' instil the subtil Poyson of Distrust  And stir my Nature up against my Child  Ant  If my incessant Duty careful Fears  Ever upon the Guard for you and Glory  Offend my Royal Master I am silent  Forgive my Zeal and I'll observe no more  King  I know Ambition is thy darling Sin  'Bating that I do believe thee honest  Then leave these doubling Arts and speak thy Purpose  Why dost thou sigh and fold thy aged Arms  Expressive Signs of some approaching Mischief  Still warning me in Whispers as I pass  To observe the Princess  Leonora  Ant  This I have done  But if I am too loyal too sincere  If Apprehension grows too swift in me  Give up the Charge you did intrust me with  To some more worthy of your Confidence  Who when they have obey'd your strict Command  And learnt each private Motion of your Court  May cautiously discover what will please  And pass in Silence what you fear to know  King  Tortures and Death pierce me at once and speak  Whate'er it be and rid my Expectation  Some secret Plot against my Life and Crown  Much rather had I hear of brooding Treason  Of raging Pestilence or blazing Cities  Prodigious Earthquakes universal Ruin  Than ought which touches  Leonora  's Fame  Ant  That I had dy'd ere given the secret Vent  I beg your Majesty will urge no more  This hated Subject  King  Urge not my Temper no I charge thee do not  Thou hast rais'd my Curiosity so high  Or give me Ease

On that selected Man  King  Traytor 'tis false I know thou hat'st  Lorenzo  The ancient Quarrel 'twixt his Blood and thine  Has made a Villain of thee  Ant  This I fear'd Oh hard Return for Loyalty  King  If thou dost not prove this Accusation  Thy Head shall answer it  Ant  Be it as you say  If I discover not near to the Bower  A Place thro' which at Midnight he's let in  And sure the Purpose is not hard to guess  King  Do this  Antenor  and my Heart is thine  My Pulse beats high impatient of Revenge  And Speech grows painful choak'd with Indignation  Down all my wild Resentments for a while  And let me see and judge like Majesty  Oh  Leonora  if thou'rt fall'n so low  To hold thy nightly Revels with my Slave  There's not a Rack thy Crimes can make me feel  But I will double it upon you

to Ages last  Yet even now whilst ready Warriors wait  He offers Peace  King  On what Conditions does your Master send  Emb  Conditions Sir he did not term 'em so  But Supplication to your Royal Will  That this fair Princess beauteous  Leonora  Would with your Leave receive him for her Husband  Lor  Ha  Emb  And join the long disputed Lands in Peace  To these of  Lombardy  Ant  I see  Lorenzo  gathers up his Brows  This Proposal stings him to the Soul  Aside  King  Had he been Conqueror thus he might have ask'd  But tell your Duke I have not yet forgotten  His great Injustice to the Duke of  Milan  He took th' Advantage of the  Turkish  War  When all my Force was bent against the Infidels  To chace my Uncle from his Dukedom forth  And set a bold Usurper in his Stead  These twenty Years he has an Exile been  He and one only Son nor know we where  Or to what Country if alive they're driven  By which my Daughter is become the Heir  Of this my Kingdom yet I'll not force her Will  But

declar'd be honest Truth  Thou can'st not fear thou hast a King thy Guard  But take thou Heed be careful in the Proof  Thou seest she does defy thee  Ante  Her Passion shows her Guiltiness the more  It is the Nature of the Sex to do it  They think to screen their Faults with empty Clamour  And stop our just Resentments with their Noise  But if your Majesty discover'd ought  That may instruct her

Friend  And Spight of all Objections I can make  He grows like Fate inexorable  Lear  Oh  Antimora  Love's become enrag'd  At thy too tedious thy too long Delay  And this Way takes to mar our promis'd Joys  And thus revenge the Breach of his Command  For disobeying his first eldest Law  Why throw we not this Tyrant Duty off  And from bless'd  Hymen  's Torch light up that Flame  Which only can expire with our Lives  To humble Plains let us from Courts retire  Serene and quiet as the first kind Pair  Before Ambition taught the Way to Sin  Ant  Nay even there our cruel Foes would find us out  And Time perhaps might change thy Nature too  When thou should'st find thy Father's Hate incline  To banish thee for ever from his Breast  Then thou would'st turn thy Eyes upon this Face  And

to encounter Hosts of Foes  Tho' certain Death attends on ev'ry Side  And see how readily I will obey thee  But what concerns my Country or my King  Love even wants Temptation to betray  Anti  Under this feign'd Allegiance thou would'st hide  Thy ancient Hatred to my Brother's Name  But I have found thee out thro' all thy Turnings  And here I cancel all our former Vows  Be every Thought of thee torn from my Breast  And Enmity eternal grow between us  This Hand on which thou ha'st so often swore  And kiss'd and breath'd thy false pretended Flame  I'll give to him that sets my Brother free  And rack my self to be reveng'd on thee  Exit  Lear  Was e'er Condition so forlorn as mine  At once fond Love and Duty tear my Bosom  Love bids my Heart obey without Controul  But Duty checks my Love and awes my Soul  Of these two great Extreams which shall I take  Shall I my Mistress or my King forsake  To both I would be faithful did I know  What Method I could take to make me so  Direct me

Passion fails to move  And bring  Learchus  over to our Interest  Thou may'st have Hope  Cardono  to succeed  For she has vow'd to see his Face no more  If he denies to set  Lorenzo  free  Card  My Friend and you command what e'er I can  But I despair of  Antimora  's Love  Nor will I poorly ask it on such Terms  To free  Lorenzo  none would hazard more  If in the Field I saw his Life beset  My own for his should offer at the Ransom  But to attempt his Rescue here is fruitless  When under Sentence by the King's Command  And guarded by his most inveterate Foe  'Twou'd plunge us all in certain Death at once  And not relieve but bring his End on faster  Leon  Then will you tamely stand and see him die  His Death conspir'd to feed a Traytor's Pride  And will you nothing dare to save your Friend  Can you forget who led you forth to conquer  And stood the Danger equal with the Meanest  Has he not gain'd immortal Honours for you  And made the Name the very Name of  Lombard  More formidable than once the  Romans  were  And can you now refuse to lend him Succour  Card  Oh Royal Madam think with what Concern  I hear your Words and know my Friend's Distress  Think you I need these Arguments to rouse me  No I only want the Means to set him free  And not the Will to do it  Enter  Antimora  Leon  See where the mourning  Antimora  comes  Like Lillies weeping with the Morning Dew  Which tho' it wets yet sullies not their Beauty  I fear alas to ask thee what Success  Anti  For me most gracious Princess nought remains  Not the least Gleam of Comfort now appears  My Hopes are dead as soon will be my Brother  Where shall I hide me from the fatal News  Or how support me under it  Leon  That both thou and I must leave to Providence  But say suppose that I should find a Way  With Lord  Cardono  's Help to free  Lorenzo  What wouldest thou contribute to his Liberty  Anti  Oh most ador'd of Princes let me kneel  kneels  And bless you for this Supposition only  If ought in

Signet of the King  Cardono  Tho' how procur'd imports not you to know  This gives you Admittance to  Lorenzo  Six trusty Slaves whom I have bought to serve me  All resolutely bold and bent for Action  Wait without and ready for the Enterprize  The Officer who guards the Fort this Day  I also have brought over to our Interest  His Soldiers are by this prepar'd with Wine  To let you pass unheeded thro' the Fort  If any others should resist these Men  At your Command will soon dispose of them  Anti  So may you prosper as your Cause is just  And be rewarded as your Soul desires  Card  Such a Reward would make a Coward brave  But if Success should crown our rising Hopes  Where can  Lorenzo  safely lye conceal'd  From the quicksighted Eye of Power and Malice  Leon  Below the Postern Gate

Remember  Antimora  what you swore  Ex  Cardono  Anti  I do and will observe it faithfully  Leon  Look down ye Angels with propitious Smiles  You whose Business 'tis to guard the Innocent  Thro' all the Mazes of this treach'rous World  And give a just Account of mortal Actions  Look down I say and bless us with Success  And seal the Vow that here I make before you  That if it e'er shall be my Lot to reign  And fill the Throne of my great Ancestors  Each Year I'll dedicate this Day to Heaven  And all the Realm shall pay its Thanks with me  Religion is the best Support of Power  And honest Men are still its best Defenders  Anti  Forgive me Heaven if for my Brother's Sake  I wish she were already on the Throne  How natural is it to prefer those Things  That touch us nearly Spite of Education  For tho' I have been ever taught to love  And pay a strict Obedience to my Sovereign  Yet now I feel that Nature's eldest Law  Pleads strongly in me for my Brother's Life  And oh this Day if young  Cardono  prospers  I give a fatal Proof of my Affection  Now to the Postern where I'll wait to see  What Destiny allots for him and me  If Life I care not how my Lot is cast  Since all my Joys are in my Brother plac'd  But if a Blank and Death these Hopes succeed  At once I'm from my Vow and all my Sorrows freed  Exit  Leon  Lorenzo  is a Pattern for Posterity  It matters not from whence or whom he sprung  Since he has all that forms the Godlike Hero  The Man tho' ne'er so meanly born in Blood  That next his Soul prefers his Country's Good  Who more than Interest does his Honour prize  And scorns by secret Treachery to rise  That can the base and gilded Bribe disdain  Prevent Reflections on his Prince's Fame  And point out glorious Virtues for his Reign  That Man should be a Monarch's

would you Sir conceal your self thus long  And draw this Load of Guiltiness upon me  Her  When he  Who now usurps my Dukedom drove me out  From Court to Court I sought in vain Relief  Your self in War unable to assist me  The Tyrant grew in great Alliance strong  And ev'ry Prince refus'd to shelter me  One  'ning as I walk'd alone in  Venice  And melancholly musing what to do  Having receiv'd my Orders to depart  I met a Hermit who call'd me by my Name  And told me all the Failings of my Life  Then bad me enter holy Orders strait  And expiate my Sins in fervent Prayer  Full twenty Years if this I well perform'd  My Son he said should wear a Regal Crown  And I should be again restor'd to  Milan  But if before that Term of Years expir'd  I lagg'd or once repin'd at what I bore  My Son and I should perishOh fatal Thought  For now I have found th' ambiguous Prophecy  The Crown he meant was Martyrdom for Love  King  Oh most unhappy Prince  Her  This when I told that honest Lord  Alcanor  He offer'd to receive my Son for his  Who then was three Years old and breed him for me  Then bound himself by Oath to keep the Secret  I strait took Orders and finding him recall'd  I soon resolv'd to fix my Dwelling here  And in a lonely Cell hard by the Bower  I liv'd unknown to all but Lord  Alcanor  My Friend upon his Deathbed charg'd  Lorenzo  To pay the Duty of a Son to me  But told him not how much he ow'd it to me  The twenty Years being now expir'd quite  I purpos'd to discover to your Majesty  The great important Story of my Life  And for which Purpose to my Son I gave  The Packet which this Lord return'd me back  But Oh my Soul when most I hop'd for Comfort  I am become most miserable  King  Cease cease to raise the Horror of my Guilt  Except you wish to drive me to Despair  Apply the Cordial of remaining Hope  That you and  Leonora  will forgive me  Lear  Help help the Princess see she comes  Mad with her Woes and grasping still the Heart  King  Open Earth and

Storms of Life will soon be over  Permit me to believe that once I was  The only darling Pleasure of your Soul  Commanded Slaves who at my Nod still fled  And were the very Creatures of my Will  Inform me then how I have lost this Power  That those who should obey dare to controul me  All that I ask is to be rid of them  I want no Daggers Asps nor Poisons now  All several Blessings for a speedy Death  But only Leave to lay a Father's Present  Next my poor Heart and sleep my Cares away  King  Look up my Child behold thy Father mourns  Thy too unhappy worthy Husband's Fall  Oh let my Penitence atone my Crime  See  Leonora  Nature is revers'd  A weeping Father kneeling to his Child  Oh promise me that thou wilt live my Daughter  And we will all revere thy Husband's Mem'ry  For him a Monument shall strait be rais'd  The  Parian  Marble and  Corinthian  Brass  And Gold from  India  shall the Pile adorn  And yearly all his Soldiers gather round  To hear Orations in his Praise for ever  Whilst I resign my Crown and Rule to thee  Leon  Oh poor Temptation to a wretched Life  What is a Crown compar'd with what I feel  Can Crowns allay Extremity of Woe  Oh no your Offers want that healing Power  And if your Sorrow's real or only feign'd  It matters not since my  Lorenzo  's gone  Since you have murder'd him by whom I liv'd  Here by this precious Relick of my Love  Which you have in the purest Metal plac'd  I swear and witness all ye sacred Powers  That guide our Lives and preordain our Fates  Hear and confirm my stedfast Vow  kneels  King  O hold my Child  Leon  No Sleep shall ever close these Eyes again  Nor Food sustain this hated Life I wear  Nor ought profane the Kiss upon my Lips  Which from my Husband I receiv'd at Parting  'Till from these Multitude of Woes reliev'd  I reenjoy my Love  rises  Lear  Oh Madam  Why will you punish all the World for one  For one rash Act committed by a Father  King  Oh that my Crown could raise him from the Grave  With eager Transport I would lay it down  With more Content with more substantial Joy  Could I behold you in each other's Arms  Than e'er the Scepter gave me  Her  I wish thy Soul had been thus touch'd before  Then my  Lorenzo  then my Son had liv'd  Leon  These are your Wishes when Relief is past  Why will you cruelly interrupt the Dying  King  Why wilt thou wound me with thy Unbelief  And rack me worse than e'er thy Husband was  What Proof of my Repentance shall I give thee  By all the Fruits of Earth and Lights of Heaven  By that superior Light the glorious Sun  From which for ever let my Eyes be shut  If they could e'er behold a Sight more pleasing  Lear  Now is my Time  Exit  Leon  In vain in vain you use these Imprecations  Since in my Breast they cannot make Impression  For he alas is gone

the Hatred of your Houses ends  Lor  I'm all Confusion Was I sav'd by thee  Oh spare my Words and read 'em in my Eyes  Lear  I ask no Thanks the King has overpaid me  Since he forgives this only Breach of Duty  Come forth my  Antimora  now no more  Bound by the Duty of a Sister's Love  Enter  Antimora  And oh I wish I cou'd produce  Cardono  I did my best to save him tho' my Rival  But

tender Care I'll pay thee  And wish I really were thy Brother now  To shew how much I prize this worthy Man  Yet take her from my Hand  Learchus  and  With her take the Heart which thou didst kindly

proclaim thy matchless Virtue  Lear  If my Delay of Duty had displeas'd  I would have offer'd up my self great Sir  And dy'd to expiate my honest Fault  Your Pardon Royal Madam's what I want  For all the Grief which I have caus'd in you  I had no gentler Means to save  Lorenzo  But by appearing to obey the King  I us'd the Heart of him  Cardono  stabb'd  To work my End and raise a Father's Pity  Hoping your real Distress might move the King  And wake Repentance in his Royal Soul  My Plot succeeded and I'm happy in it  Leon  Let tender Maids that feel the Force of Love  For ever bless and ever
