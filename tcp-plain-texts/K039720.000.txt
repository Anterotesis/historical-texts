some time ago under the names of Rowley and Canning are still undetermined notwithstanding all the arguments brought on one side to support their authenticity and on the other to prove them the forgeries of a young literary adventurer the question is still brought to no conclusion and as the partisans of each hypothesis declare themselves unconvinced by the evidences of the other the matter may be considered as yet involved in doubt and obscurity The following collection of pieces are liable to none of the objections which are made to the other They are the genuine and acknowledged  productions of Thomas Chatterton a person whose genius and abilities exercised at a very early period of life will no less command the respect of posterity than they have excited the attention and divided the sentiments of the ablest judge of the present age  With respect to Rowley's poems the prevailing opinion seems to be th  they were actually written by Chatterton for though the antique manner in which they were cloathed had served greatly to disguise them yet it could not but be observed that that the smoothness of the versification and the frequent  The argument arising from the coincidences which might be pointed out between the supposed ancient poems and later writers hath not been attended to in the manner it deserves It would be more decisive than any other yet made use of Let any person compare the parallel passages lately pointed out by a writer in the St James's Chronicle No May and at the same time advert to the rules laid down by bishop Hurd for the discovery of imitations and he will not hesitate to acknowledge that the writer of Rowley's poems certainly lived in the present century As this letter will be considered as a curiosity by all who interest themselves concerning the authenticity of those poems and as it is not readily to be referred to being printed only in a newspaper we have subjoined it to the present publication  See page xxiv  traces of imitation of later  writers  utterly inconsistent with the  their being the productions of the fifteenth century These circumstances did no escape the observation of many gentlemen at th  ir f  rst appearance but that forgeries  ld be attempted by one who had not reached the age of seventeen years and that these attempts should be conducted with a degree of skill and judgment which obliged the most intelligent to doubt and  at the same time almost compelled the most doubtful to assent seemed to be hardly within the reach of probability it rather in the opinion of many bordered on imimpossibility  It hath been presumed though without duly weighing circumstances that it would be a wild conjecture to suppose a young and almost uneducated man was capable of conducting a complicated fraud which required applications very different from those which the season of his life and his means of information seemed to point out and at the same time such a course of study as is very seldom pursued until a more advanced period But before this is granted it should be recollected that he was as Mr Warton  Additions to History of Poetry vol II  observe    a singular instance of a prematurity  of abilities and that he had acquired a store of general information far exceeding his years that he possessed a comprehension of mind and activity of understanding which predominated over his situations in life and his opportunities of instruction  When these facts are remembered it will not be considered so very incredible and the history of the human mind will furnish many examples of a maturity of judgment in persons at as early an age which will diminish the surprise which must at the first glance impress every person who reflects upon this extraordinary phenomenon It should be recollected before we pronouce decisively upon this subject that there have been instances almost as extraordinary as that we have now under consideration Dr Wotton at the age of six years acquired a considerable knowledge in the Latin Greek and Hebrew tongues and Dr Johnson  has given the life of one  John Phillip Barretier  who mastered five languages at the age of nine years These acquisitions are certainly as wonderful as Chatterton's knowledge of the obsolete language of the th and th centuries which he was known to be fond of and to which he had particularly applied his attention Nor should the contrivance of such a fraud be deemed beyond the reach of one who possessed such abilities It is known that a person who was distinguished by the name of Psalmanazar in the beginning of the present century fabricated a new language and actually succeeded in imposing upon some of the most intelligent and inquisitive persons of the times who were equally as desirous as able to detect the imposture had it not been managed with a degree of art which eluded all their vigilance  It will hardly be denied that acquisitions like those we have before mentioned are equally surprising with any which Chatterton is supposed to have reached unless the invention of new characters for a language or the difficulties of obtaining an accurate knowledge of the Latin Greek and Hebrew are more easy to overcome than to imitate the manner of writing in the time of Edward the fourth But instances may be produced of persons whose extent of intelligence hath been as great in subjects more abstruse and not less out of the common walk than those to which Chatterton devoted his attention It will be sufficient to name the celebrated Crichton and M Servin mentioned by Sully between both whom and our author a resemblance might be discovered as well in their astonishing abilities as in those defects which marked the private  characters of each of these young adventurers  As the present publication consists of pieces of which not the smallest doubt was ever entertained of their being genuine it is totally unnecessary here to enter into any argument either to support or invalidate those proofs which have been adduced of the authenticity of the supposed ancient poems and it is the less incumbent on the present editor as the public hath lately received entire satisfaction on that head from the same gentleman to whom we are indebted for the first collection of this writer's works It may not however be unnecessary to add a few words in order to compleat the short account given by that gentleman of so extraordinary a personage who may be considered as the literary phenomenon of the times and whose genius if it had been properly fostered and encouraged might have carried English literature  to as high a pitch as any author in the present century One can scarce avoid drawing a parallel upon the present occasion from the similarity of circumstances between our author and the great father of the English stage the one obliged to cramp and abase his genius to the ideas and taste of a barbarous audience the other from necessity compelled to obey the mandates of the directers of our monthly publications equally dogmatical ignorant and insipid  The former editor hath already set forth the few circumstances relative to his author which he possessed in common with other men The time of his birth and death the names of his parents his profession and the confined mode of his education are all accurately stated It is to be regretted that he permitted the  sangfroid  of the antiquary to repress that  warmth which the excellence of his author might have been expected to excite surely that excellence demanded some few words of commendation it is also to be lamented that he did not enter more minutely into the disposition and circumstances of one whom he could not but respect as an author however he might dislike his chararacter as a man and here it must be confessed Chatterton appears to us in the most unfavourab  e point of view He possessed all the vices and irregularities of youth and his profligacy was at least as conspicuous as his abilities Although he was of a profession which might be said to accelerate his pursuits in antiquities yet so averse was he to that profession that he could never overcome it One of his first efforts to emerge from a situation so irksome to him was an application to a gentleman well known in the republic of letters  which unfortunately for the public and himself met with a very cold reception and which the disappointed author always spoke of with a high degree of acrimony whenever it was mentioned to him  After his quitting Bristol he was engaged to assist Mr Northhook in a history of London then publishing in numbers and at the same time was daily writing some piece for the magazines Every effort appears to have been insufficient to ward off the approach of poverty and very soon after he settled in London his distress became so great that he meditated a design of going to Senegal  See Poem to Miss Bush page  This intention was never executed He continued drudging for the booksellers a few months when at last oppressed with poverty and disease in  a fit of despair he put an end to his existence in the month of August with a dose of poison  Such was the wretched life and such the fatal end of one who had he not prematurely finished his days had bidden fair to do the highest honours to English literature The reader will anticipate every reflection of regret which can be made upon this occasion and while he sympathizes with the unfortunate he will lament that one who is allowed to have been as Mr Warton expresses it  "a prodigy of genius"  should by the mere dint of distress be tempted to rid himself of an insupportable existence He will feel himself hurt at the idea that no notice should be taken of one who the last mentioned writer pronounces would have proved the first of English poets had he reached a maturer age and perhaps  he may feel some indignation against the person to whom his first application was made and by whom he was treated with neglect and contempt It were to be wished that the public was fully informed of all the circumstances attending that unhappy application the event of which deprived the world of works which might have contributed to the honour of the nation as well as the comfort and happiness of their unfortunate author  It is observed by the elegant writer before quoted that some of the verses contained in the following miscellany which are those written by their author  without any design to deceive have been judged to be most astonishing productions by the first critic of the present age  After such a judgment it cannot be mentioned without exciting wonder that writings which  deserve such a character should continue undistinguished amidst the trash of monthly compilations A striking similarity may be observed between them and their author both having met with a fate very unworthy their merit equally contemned and despised he living and dying in obscurity they remaining neglected and almost unknown  That they may hereafter stand a monument of the application and abilities of an unfortunate man untimely lost to himself and to the public one who had a slight knowledge of him in his life time but not enough to be acquainted with his merits until too late who considers the neglect which hath been shewn to these his acknowledged works as an imputation on the taste and curiosity of the age hath employed a few leisure hours in collecting the following  miscellany which he trusts after such respectable opinions as are before quoted will not require either excuse or apology but on the contrary will entitle him to the acknowledgments of those readers whose candour will induce them to applaud the marks of genius which may be found herein and at the same time make every due allowance for those imperfections which haste or the unhappy circumstances in which many of them were written would have given the author had he been living a title to expect and demand  J B  Bristol  June  To the Printer of the St James's Chronicle  SIR  AFTER the opinion which the reverend Mr Thomas Warton has delivered concerning the authenticity of the poems attributed to Rowley it may be expected that those who maintain a contrary doctrine should publish some arguments in support of it For my part I shall rather employ memory than sagacity on this subject and have no weight to throw into either scale except the following parallels observing at the same time how extraordinary it is that so many coincidences should be discoverable between Shakespeare Dryden c and Rowley whose name was never

Chatterton's productions we have placed it before the others in this collection as it will afford some gratification to many readers to compare the earliest effort of his invention with the other

at the will of the Almighty When the thunders roar the lightnings shine on the rising waves and the black clouds sit on the brow of the lofty hill who then protects the flying deer swift as a sable cloud tost by the whistling winds leaping over the rolling floods to gain the hoary wood whilst the lightnings shine on his chest and the wind rides over his horns When the wolf roars terrible as the voice of the Severn moving majestic as the nodding forests on the brow of Michelstow who then commands the sheep to follow the swain as the beams of light attend upon the morningKnow O man That God suffers not the least member of his work to perish without answering the purpose of their creation The evils of life with some are blessings and the plant of death healeth the wound of the swordDoth the sea of trouble and affliction overwhelm thy soul look unto the Lord thou shalt stand  firm in the days of temptation as the lofty hill of Kinwulf in vain shall the waves beat against thee thy rock shall stand  Comely as the white rocks bright as the star of the evening tall as the oak upon the brow of the mountain soft as the showers of dew that fall upon the flowers of the field Ethelgar arose the glory of  Ex  Exanceastre noble were his ancestors as the palace of the great Kenric his soul with the lark every morning ascended the skies and sported in the clouds when stealing down the steep mountain wrapt in a shower of spangling dew evening came creeping to the plain closing the flowers of the day shaking her pearly showers upon the rustling trees then was his voice heard in the grove as the voice of the nightingale upon the hawthorn spray he sung the works of the Lord the hollow rocks joined in his devotions the stars danced to his song the rolling years in various mantles drest confest him manHe saw Egwina of the vale his soul was astonished as the Britons who fled before the sword of Kenric she was tall as the towering elm stately as a black cloud bursting into thunder fair as the wrought bowels of the earth gentle and  sweet as the morning breeze beauteous as the sun blushing like the vines of the west her soul as fair as the azure curtain of heaven She saw Ethelgar her soft soul melted as the flying snow before the sun The shrine of St Cuthbert united them The minutes fled on the golden wings of bliss Nine horned moons had decked the sky when Aelgar saw the light he was like a young plant upon the mountain's side or the sun hid in a cloud he felt the strength of his fire and swift as the lightnings of Heaven pursued the wild boar of the wood The morn awoke the sun who stepping from the mountain's brow shook his ruddy locks upon the shining dew Aelgar arose from sleep he seized his sword and spear and issued to the chace As waters swiftly falling down a craggy rock so raged young Aelgar thro' the wood the wild boar bit his spear and the fox died at his feet From the thicket a wolf arose his eyes flaming like two stars he roared like the voice of the tempest hunger made him furious and and he fled like a falling meteor to the war Like a thunderbolt tearing the black rock Aelgar darted his spear through his heart The wolf raged like the voice of many waters and seizing Aelgar by by the throat he sought the regions of the blessedThe wolf died upon his bodyEthelgar and  Egwina weptThey wept like the rains of the spring sorrow sat upon them as the black clouds upon the mountains of death but the power of God settled their hearts  The golden sun arose to the highest of his power the apple perfumed the gale and the juicy grape delighted the eye Ethelgar and Egwina bent their way to the mountain's side like two stars that move through the sky The flowers grew beneath their feet the trees spread out their leaves the sun played upon the rolling brook the winds gently passed along Dark pitchy clouds veiled the face of the sun the winds roared like the noise of a battle the swift hail descended to the ground the lightnings broke from the sable clouds and gilded the dark brown corners of the sky the thunder shook the lofty mountains the tall towers nodded to their foundations the bending oaks divided the whistling wind the broken flowers fled in confusion round the mountain's side Ethelgar and Egwina sought the sacred shade the bleak winds roared over their heads and the waters ran over their feet Swift from the dark cloud the lightning came the skies blushed at the sight Egwina stood on the brow of the lofty hill like an oak in the spring the lightnings  danced about her garments and the blasting flame blackened her face the shades of death swam before her eyes and she fell breathless down the black steep rock the sea received her body and she rolled down with the roaring water  Ethelgar stood terrible as the mountain of Maindip the waves of despair harrowed up his soul as the roaring Severn plows the sable sand wild as the evening wolf his eyes shone like the red vapors in the valley of the dead horror sat upon his brow like a bright star shooting through the sky he plunged from the lofty brow of the hill like a tall oak breaking from the roaring wind Saint Cuthbert appeared in the air the black clouds fled from the sky the sun gilded the spangling meadows the lofty pine stood still the violets of the vale gently moved to the soft voice of the wind the sun shone on the bubbling brook The saint arrayed in glory caught the falling mortal as the soft dew of the morning hangs upon the lofty elm he bore him to the sandy beech whilst the sea roared beneath his feet Ethelgar opened his eyes like the grey orbs of the morning folding up the black mantles of the nightKnow O man said the member of the blessed to submit to the will of  God he is terrible as the face of the earth when the waters sunk to their habitations gentle as the sacred covering of the oak secret as the bottom of the great deep just as the rays of the morning Learn that thou art a man nor repine at the stroke of the Almighty for God is as just as he is great The holy vision disappeared as the atoms fly before the sun Ethelgar arose and bent his way to the college of Kenewalein there he flourishes as a hoary oak in the wood of Arden  D B  Bristol  March  KENRICK TRANSLATED FROM THE SAXON  WHEN winter yelled through the leafless grove when the black waves rode over the roaring winds and the darkbrown clouds hid the face of the sun when the silver brook stood still and snow environed the top of the lofty mountain when the flowers appeared not in the blasted fields and the boughs of the leafless trees bent with the loads of ice when the howling of the wolf affrighted the darkly glimmering light of the western sky Kenrick terrible as the tempest young as the snake of the valley strong as the mountain of the slain his armour shining like the stars in the dark night when the moon is veiled in sable and the blasting winds howl over the wide plain his shield like the black rock prepared himself for war  Ceolwolf of the high mountain who viewed the first rays of the morning star swift as the flying deer strong as a young oak fierce as an evening  wolf drew his sword glittering like the blue vapours in the valley of Horso terrible as the red lightning bursting from the darkbrown clouds his swift bark rode over the foaming waves like the wind in the tempest the arches fell at his blow and he wrapt the towers in flames he followed Kenrick like a wolf roaming for prey  Centwin of the vale arose he seized the massy spear terrible was his voice great was his strength he hurled the rocks into the sea and broke the strong oaks of the forest Slow in the race as the minutes of impatience His spear like the fury of a thunderbolt swept down whole armies his enemies melted before him like the stones of hail at the approach of the sun  Awake O Eldulph Thou that sleepest on the white mountain with the fairest of women no more pursue the darkbrown wolf arise from the mossy bank of the falling waters let thy garments be stained in blood and the streams of life discolour thy girdle let thy flowing hair be hid in a helmet and thy beauteous countenance be writhed into terror  Egward keeper of the barks arise like the roaring waves of the sea pursue the black companies of the enemy  Ye Saxons who live in the air and glide over the stars act like yourselves  Like the murmuring voice of the Severn swelled with rain the Saxons moved along like a blazing star the sword of Kenrick shone among the Britons Tenyan bled at his feet like the red lightning of heaven he burnt up the ranks of his enemy  Centwin raged like a wild boar Tatward sported in blood armies melted at his stroke Eldulph was a flaming vapour destruction sat upon his sword Ceolwolf was drenched in gore but fell like a rock before the sword of Mervin  Egward pursued the slayer of his friend the blood of Mervin smoked on his hand  Like the rage of a tempest was the noise of the battle like the roaring of the torrent gushing from the brow of the lofty mountain  The Britons fled like a black cloud dropping hail flying before the howling winds  Ye virgins arise and welcome back the pursuers deck their brows with chaplets of jewels spread the branches of the oak beneath their feet Kenrick is returned from the war the clotted gore hangs terrible upon his crooked sword like the noxious vapours on the black rock his knees are red with the gore of the foe  Ye sons of the song sound the instruments of music ye virgins dance around him  Costan of the lake arise take thy harp from the willow sing the praise of Kenrick to the sweet sound of the white waves sinking to the foundation of the black rock  Rejoice O ye Saxons Kenrick is victorious  CERDICK TRANSLATED FROM THE SAXON  THE rosecrowned dawn dances on the top of the lofty hill Arise O Cerdick from thy mossy bed for the noise of the chariots is heard in the valleys  Ye Saxons draw the sword prepare the flying dart of death swift as the glancing sight meet the foe upon the brow of the hill and cast the warriors headlong into the roaring stream  The swords of the Saxons appear on the high rock like the lake of death reflecting the beams of the morning sun  The Britons begin to ascend the ragged fragments of the shrinking rock thick as the hail in the howling storm driven down the mountain's side the son of the tempest the chariot and the horse roll in confusion to the bloodstained vale  Sons of war descend let the river be swelled with the smoaking streams of life and the mountain of the slain ascend to the stars  They fall beneath the spear of Cerdick  Sledda is a flame of fire Kenbert scatters the nevererring shaft of death Aelle is a tempest a cloud bursting in blood a winter's wind blasting the soul his knees are encircled with lifewarm gore his white robe is like the morning sky Ceaulin's spear is exalted like the star of the evening his fallen enemies rise in hills around him  The actions of Cerdick astonish the soul the foe is melted from the field and the gods have lost their sacrifice  Cerdick leans upon his spear he sings the praises of the gods let the image be filled with the bodies of the dead for the foe is swept away like purple bloom of the grape no more to be seen The sacred flames ascend the clouds the warriors dance around it The evening slowly throws her dusky vale over the face of the sun  Cerdick arose in his tent  Ye sons of war who shake the silver javelin and the pointed shield arise from the soft slumbers of the night assemble to council at the tent of Cerdick  From the darkbrown spring from the verdant top of the impending rock from the flowery vale and the coppiced heath the chiefs of the war arose  Graceful as the flower that overlooks the silver stream the mighty Cerdick stood among the warriors attention seals up their lips  Why will ye sleep ye Saxons whilst the hanging mountain of fortune trembles over our heads Let us gird on the reeking sword and wrap in flame the town of Doranceastre strong as the foundation of the earth swift as the impetuous stream deadly as the corrupted air sudden as the whirlwind piercing to the hidden bed of the sea armed in the red lightnings of the storm will we come upon the foe Prepare the sword and shield and follow the descendant of Woden  As when the sable clouds incessantly descend in rivers of rain to the woodcrowned hills the foundation of the ground is loosened and the forest gently slides to the valley such was the appearance of the warriors moving to the city of Doranceastre the spears appeared like the stars of the black night their spreading shields like the evening sky  Turn your eyes O ye Saxons to the distant mountain on the spreading top a company is seen they are like the locusts of the East like a darkbrown cloud expanding in the wind they come down the hills like the stones of hail the javelin nods over the helm death sports in their shadows They are children of Woden see the god of battle fans the air the red sword waves in their banner Ye sons of battle wait their approach let their eyes be feasted with the chaplets of victory  It is Kenrick I see the lightning on his shield his eyes are two stars his arm is the arrow of death he drinks the blood of the foe as the rays of the summer sun drink the softly stealing brook he moves like the moon attended by the  stars his bloodstained robe flies around him like the white clouds of the evening tinged with the red beams of the sinking sun  See the chaplet hangs on his helm shade him O ye sons of war with the pointed shield  Kenrick approaches the shields of the brave hang over his head He speaks attention dances on the ear  Son of Woden receive a conquering son the bodies of the slain rise in mountains the ashes of the towns choak up the river the roaring stream of Severn is filled with the slaughtered sons of thunder the warriors hang upon the cliffs of the red rocks the mighty men like the sacrifice of yesterday will be seen no more the briars shall hide the plain the grass dwell in the desolate habitation the wolf shall sleep in the palace and the fox in the temple of the gods the sheep shall wander without a shepherd and the goats be scattered in the high mountains like the surrows on the bank of the swelling slood the enemies are swept away the gods are glutted with blood and peace arises from the solitary grove  Joy wantons in the eye of Cerdick By the powers that send the tempest the red lightning and roaring thunder by the God of war whose delight is in blood and who preys upon the souls of the brave by the powers of the great deep I swear that Kenrick shall sit on my throne guide the sanguine spear of war and the glittering sceptre of peace  Cerdick girds his son with the sword of royalty The warriors dance around him the clanging shields echo to the distant vales the fires ascend the skies the town of Doranceastre increases the flame and the great image is red with the blood of the captives the cries of the burning soe are drowned in the songs of joy the ashes of the image are scattered in the air the bones of the foe are broken to dust  Great is the valour of Cerdick great is the strength of Kenrick  D B  Bristol  May  GODRED CROVAN A POEM  Composed by  DOPNAL SYRRIC Scheld  of  Godred Crovan  King of the  Isle of Man  ARISE O son of Harald the Black for the son of Syrric sleeps upon the mountain under the mossy rock prepare thy silver lance shake the clotted gore of the wolf from thy spreading shield Fingal of the brown lake whose sword divides the lofty pine whose spear is ever moist with the blood of the slain will assist thy arm Cullisin who sleeps on the brow of the mountain whose feet are swift as the days of mirth will draw forth his troops from the forest The lions of the plain Morvor and Essyr will swell thy army as the falling rain swells the silver brook they wait for thy presence as the brown meadow for the spring they will shoot out in blood and blossom in victory  Godred Crovan son of Harald the Black whose name has put to flight armies arise  Godred arose he met the chiefs on the plain they sat down and feasted till the evening there sat Cochlin with the long spear whose arm is a thunderbolt on the banks of the sea he fought an host and rained blood on the plain of Mervor brown is his face as the sunburnt heath strong his arm as the roaring sea he shook his black locks like clouds tossed by the winds he sings the song of joy Godwin of the rushy plain lay upon the skin of the wolf his eyes are stars his blows are lightning Tatwallin sat by his side he sung sweet as the birds of spring he fought like the angry lion  O Tatwallin sing the actions of Harold the Swift  Tatwallin arose from his seat the horn of mirth graced his righthand  Hear ye sons of blood whilst the horn of mirth is refreshing your souls the actions of Harald the Swift  "The wolf of Norway beat his anlace on his silver shield the sons of war assembled around him Swain of the clefthill shook the spear on his left and Harald the Black the lion of Iceland on his right dyed in gore Fergus of the spreading hills was cased in black armour his eyes shone with rage his sword sported with the beams of the sun  "Warriors said the chief of the host let us assault the foe swift as the hawk let us fly to the war strong as the bull fierce as the wolf will we rage in the fight the followers of Harold the son of Godwin shall melt away as the summer clouds they shall fall like the flowers of the field their souls will fade with the blasting of our valour  "Swain prepares for war he sounds the brazen helmet his followers lift high the deadly spear  "The son of Godwin appears on the bridge his banner waves in the wind like a storm he scattered the troops of Swain  "Edmund shot the arrows of death  "Madded by defeat Swain plunged into his band the sword of Edmund sounded on his helmet their silver shields were heard upon the stream the sword of Edmund sunk to the heart of the son of Egwin he bit the bloody sand at his feet  "Harald the Black stood on the bridge he swelled the river with gore he divides the head of Edmund as the lightning tears the top of the strong rock armies melted before him none can withstand his rage The son of Godwin views him from the hill of death he seized the flaming banner and sounds the silver shield  "Girth Leofric and Morcar pillars of the war fly to his shadow with a troop of knights fierce as evening wolves they beset Harald the Black like a tempest they rage like a rock he repels their assault hills of the slain arise before him the course of the stream is turned aside  "Warriors said the son of Godwin though we rage like a tempest like a rock he repels our assault Morcar let one of thy knights descend beneath the bridge and pierce him through the back with a spear  "Selwyn swift as a salling meteor shot beneath the wave the sharp spear pierces through the back of Harald the Black he falls like a mountain in an earthquake his eyes shot fire and his teeth gnashed with rage he dies  "The hopes of Norway are no more Harold the Swift led his troops to the bridge they started at the sight of the mighty body they wept they sled  "Thee Godred only thee of all the thousands of the war prepared thy sword for battle they dragged thee from the field  "Great was the sorrow of the sons of Norway"  Tatwallin ended his song the chiefs arose from the green plain they assemble their troops on the banks of Lexy  Ceormond with the green spear martialled his band he deduced his lineage from Woden and displayed the shield of Penda Strong as the tower of Pendragon on the hill furious as the souls of the unburied warriors his company were all chiefs  Upon the high hills he encountered Moryon like dashing waves they rushed to the war their swords rained blood to the valley beneath Moryon wild as the winter's wind raged in the fight the pointed javelin quivered in his breast he rolled down the high hill Son of Woden great was thy might by thy hand the two sons of Osmor fell to the valley  How are thy warriors stretched upon the bank of the Lexy like willows  Ealward of the brown rock who dyes his anlace in the blood of the wolves of the hill whose spear like a star blasts the souls of the foe see he sleeps with the chiefs upon the skin of the wolf the battle is raging in his fancy he grasps the bloody spear his enemies fly before him joy and rage dance on his brow thus sleeping he is as the sun slightly covered with a cloud  Dugnal who inhabits the isles whose barks are swifter than the wind stands on the bank of the stream his eyes are bent on the spangling wave his hands press the silverheaded spear he is a lion in the war in the council wise as the ancient priests  Wilver stands on the righthand of Godred he is a rock unmoved by the tempest of war  Lagman is a young oak he flourishes in the heat of the glory of his fire the warriors are like the stars of the winter night  The noise of a multitude is heard from the hills Godred sets his troops in order for war they are seen on the brow of the hill Many are the foes of Godred great is the courage of his warriors  Raignald of the isles attends the chiefs of his foes his arm is strong as the flourishing oak his wisdom deep as the black lake his swift ships slew over the waves he defied to battle the prince of the mountains  Bladdyn fell by his hand he burnt the palace of the wood the horn embossed with gold graced his spoils he returned to his castle over a sea of blood  Dunhelm bears the banner of the foe he is the dragon of the mossy plain he kept the water of the seven springs Wynfylt and his warriors sought  to bear away the water in the horn of hospitality Dunhelm arose from his strong fort his anlace glittered over his head  Children of the hills said the son of Olave restore the water to the gentlyrunning stream  The son of Meurig answered not the anlace of Dunhelm divided his head his blows fell like the stones of hail when the loud winds shake the top of the lofty tree the warriors fled like the clouds of night at the approach of the sun  Elgar from the borders of Northumberland was among the enemies of Godred Crovan son of Harald the Black he led his troop down the hill and began the fight with Ospray like the raging of the lake of blood when the loud winds whistle over the sharp cliffs of the rock was the noise of the battle  Summerled rose in the sight like the rays of the morning blood beamed about him his helmet sell from his head his eyes were like the lights upon the billows  Octha who fought for Godred opposed the passage of his rage his shield was like the rising sun  his spear the tower of Mabyn the spear of Summerled sounded on the shield of Octha he heard the shrill cry of joy as the broken weapon fell to the ground his sword fell upon the shoulder of Summerled he gnashed his teeth and died  Ospray like a lion ravages the band of Elgar Octha follows behind him dying his long white robe in blood  Elgar flies to the son of Vorti his spear sounds upon his helmet the sword of Octha divides the shield of Elgar the Northumbrian warrior retires to his band Dunhelm drives his long spear through the heart of Octha he falls to the ground Wilver sets his foot upon his breathless corpse and buries him beneath the bodies of the foe  Raignald with his band flies to the relief of Dunhelm the troops of Wilver and Ospray slowly retire Dunhelm falls by the javelin of an unknown warrior so falls the eagle by the arrow of the child  Raignald rages like the fires of the mountain the troops of Dugnal and Ceormond melt before him  Dugnal lifts high his broad shield against the breast of Raignald his sword hangs over his head the troops of Raignald retire with their chief Ealward and the son of Harald the Black fly to the war the foe retire before them Raignald encourages his men like an eagle he rages in the fight  The troops of Godred halt the bands of Dugnal and Ceormond forsake their leaders  Godred retires to the bank of the Lexy the foe followed behind but were driven back with shame On the bank of the Lexy the warriors are scattered like broken oaks  Godred sounds the silver shield the chiefs assemble round his tent  Let us again to the war O chiefs and drive the foe over the mountains  They prepare for war Dugnal leads the wolves of the isle with a loud voice they began the fight Ealward falls by the sword of Raignald Cullifin scatters the javelins of fate Fingal rages in the fight but sell by the sword of Elgar  Cochlin heard the dying groans of his friend his sword pierced the heart of Elgar he fell upon the body of Fingal  Morvor and Essyr raged like sons of blood thousands fell around them Godwin scattered slaughter through the host of the soe Tatwallin sweeps down the chief of the battle like the noise of torrents rolling down the high mountains is the noise of the fight the feet of the warriors are wet with blood the sword of Cochlin is broken his spear pierces through the foe like lightning through the oak the chiefs of Godred fill the field with the bodies of the dead the night approaches and victory is undecided the black clouds bend to the earth Raignald and Godred both retire  The chiefs of Godred assembled at the tent of council Tatwallin arose and sung  "When the flowers arose in the verdant meadows when the birds of spring were heard in the grove of Thor the son of Victa prepared his knights for war strong as the mossy tomb of Ursic were the warriors he had chose for his band they issued out to the war Wecca shook the crooked anlace at their head  "Halt said the son of Victa let the troops stand still still as the silent wood when the winds are laid asleep the Saxons stood on the spreading plain  "Sons of blood Said the immortal Wecca the foe against whom we must fight are stronger than the whole power of our king let the son of Henna with three hundred warriors be hid in the darkbrown wood when the enemy faint in the battle let them spread themselves like the bursting cloud and rain a shower of blood the foe will be weakened astonished and fly  "The warriors held their broad shields over the head of the son of Victa they gave him the chaplet of victory and sang the song of joy  "Hennack with the flower of the war retired to the darkbrown wood the sun arose arrayed in garments of blood Wecca led his men to the battle like bears they raged in the fight yet the enemy fled not neither were they moved the fight continued till noon the troops of the son of Victa fought like the dragons of the mountain the foe sainted they were weakened yet they fled not  "The son of Henna drew forth his band to the plain like a tempest they fell upon the foe they were astonished they fled  "Godred Crovan son of Harald the Black the lion of Iceland and all the warriors who fight in his cause let us pursue the same method let the mountain of Secafull conceal Dugnal and three hundred chosen warriors from the eyes of Raignald when he is spent in the fight let them issue to the war"  Godred arose from his throne he led Tatwallin to a seat at his righthand  Dugnal prepares his troop sing O Tatwallin the actions of Hengist and Horsa  Tatwallin arose from his seat  "When the black clouds stooped below the tops of the high hills when the wolf came forth from the wood when the branches of the pine perished when the yews only smiled upon the russetheath the sons of Woden led the furious warriors to the bank of the swift stream there  sat the horse of the hill whose crooked sword shone like the star of the evening  "Peada was the banner of the hills when he waved his golden torce upon the bodies of the slain the hearts of his companions beamed with victory he joined the numerous bands of the sons of Woden like a swelling stream they enter the borders of the land of Cuccurcha  "Locca of the brown valley sounds the shield the king of Urrin hears the sound he starts from his seat assemble the lions of war for the enemy are upon the borders  "Sons of Morven upon whose shields are seen the hawk and the serpent swift as the wind fly to the warriors of Abon's stream sons of war prepare the spreading shield the sword of fire the spear the azure banner made sacred by the God  "Cuccurcha issues to the war as an enemy's wolf to the field  "Selward whose face is a summer cloud gleaming with the recent lightning of the storms shakes the broad anlace  "Eadgar and Emmieldred sons of the mighty Rovan who discomfitted Osniron with his steeds of fire when the god of war the blood stained Woden pitched his tent on the bank of the wide lake are seen in the troop  "Creadda whose feet are like those of the horse lifts high the silver shield  "On the plain near the palace of Frica he encountered with Egward their swords rained blood shields echoed to the valley of slaughter  "These were the warriors of Cuccurcha the lions of the war  "Hengist and Horsa met them on the sandy plain the shafts of death clouded the sun swift as the ships of Horsa strong as the arm of Suchullin Peada ravaged the band of Cuccurcha like a mountain Eadgar sustained the blow of Hengist great was the fury of Emmieldred his spear divided the broad shield his anlace sunk into the heart the sword of Anyoni pierced the breast of Cuccurcha he fell like an oak to the plain  "Creadda rages in the battle he is a wild boar of the wood the anlace of Horsa sounds on his round helm he gnashes his teeth he churns the smoaking gore he dies Locca reclines on his long spear he is wearied with dealing death among his foes the anlace of Hengist alights on his back he falls to the ground  "The men of Urrin sled to the forest the lions of war Hengist and Horsa throw the spears of flight they burn up the souls of the flying foe the great image is red with blood the flame lights the stars the moon comes forth to grace the feast the chaplet of victory hangs on the brow of the warriors"  Tatwallin ended his song  The morning crept from the mountains Dugnal with his troops retired to the forest on the mountain of Scoafull  Godred Crovan son of Harald the Black the lion of Iceland prepares for battle Raignald came down to the plain long was the fight and bloody  Godred Crovan beat his anlace on the shield the warriors upon the mountain heard the sound of the silver shield swift as the hunted stag they fly to the war they hear the noise of the battle the shout of the onset swells in the wind the loud din of the war increases as the thunder rolling from afar they fly down the mountains where the fragments of the sharp rock are scattered around they ascend like the vapours folding up the high hill upon the borders of Osloch their helmets sweep the dawn of the morning the saffron light shines on the broad shield through the dark dells they cut a passage through the dells where the beams of the sun are never seen  On the rushy moor of Rossin they astonish the foe and join in the war  There fought Godred Crovan death sat on his sword the yelling breath of the dying foe shook his banner his shield the stream of Lexy which urrounds the darkbrown wood and shines at the noon of day his anlace dropped blood and tore through the helmets of the foe like the red lightning of the storm  Dugnal chief of the mountain warriors who drove Rygwallon from his chariot of war lifted his shield and spear through the heart of Morval the weapon persorated he yelled like a wolf of the mountain he died  Weolmund of the white rock arose in the fight like the fires of the earth he burnt up the ranks of the foe his spear a blasted oak his shield the sea when the winds are still he appeared a hill on whose top the winter snow is seen and the summer sun melts it up victory sat on his helmet death on his anlace  Wilver who supports the tottering rocks who flies like the bird of summer over the plain shakes the crooked sword as he rages upon the hills of the slain and is red with living gore the spears of the foe are gathered about him the sharp javelins sound on his shield he looks around the field the savage Edwin flies to his aid like two wolves they rage in the war their shields are red with blood  The bear of the north throws his lance the furclad Godard Syrric displays his starry shield the  chiefs fall at his feet he rises on the breast of Rynon storms of blood surround his sword blood flows around him  When the storm rages in the sky the torrents roll to the plain the trees of the wood are borne away the castle falls to the ground such was the fury of the fight on the moor of Rossin the chiefs fell our foes halt they fly swift as the clouds of winter Ospray throws the spear of Chaso swift as their fear he flies to the pursuit the soul of Godred melted he rolled the blue banner wrought with gold round the crimson stream his warriors dance around him they sing the song of Harald the Black they hail him king the golden sandal is thrown over his helmet May the Gods grant this war for empire be his last  THE HIRLAS Translated from the ancient  British  of OWEN CYFELIOG Prince of  Powys  ERE the sun was seen on the brow of the mountain the clanging shields were heard in the valley our enemies were apalled at the sound The red armour of our warriors glittered till the noon of day The foe fled from the borders they fell in the chace like stones of hail they panted like hunted wolves  Let the Hirlas of Rhys overflow like the waters of the great river  Where the golden banners declare the valour of Rhys had the horn of hospitality long been used it relieved the warriors who fainted in the chace and the traveller whose habitation is beyond the white mountains  Bring here O cupbearer the carved Hirlas of mirth which glows with livid gold let the sparkling mead slow around it  Gwgwyn prince of my table son of mighty men thine are the first honours of the Hirlas small is the gift of gratitude great were thy services When thy ancestors stood in the fight victory stood with them loud were their voices in the battle as the hygra of their charge  Fill the golden Hirlas of mirth attend to the merits of the warriors lest they revenge on thee the disgrace of their honour  See Gryffydh with his uplifted crimson spear expects it he is the bulwark of the borders sprung from Cynfyll and the dragons of the hill his name shall ever live in the songs of the bards As refreshed with the drink of mirth his attendants fought furious as the battle of the champions of the valley Whilst the tomb of Pendragon shall stand on the hill his same shall remain in the song  Fill up the Hirlas to Eadnyfed who sits like a god upon his broken armour like a tempest he  fell upon the shields of his foes near Gyrthyn he slew an host  The distant nations heard the noise of the battle of Maelor the sound of the shields was heard in the mountains Dreadful was the conflict as that of Bangor when the warriors were trod to the ground The princes fled Morach beat the earth with his feet Morvran fled over the mountain  Fill up the golden Hirlas Let the mead be borne to Sylliw defender of our coast to the lion of war the son of Madoc fierce as a wolf in the fight soft as the mossy bed in peace  To the sons of Essyner bear it next strong as two rocks they raged in the fight the bravest champion falls before them like storms they pierce the targets of the foe sweeping down the multitude as the loud billows sweep the sand  Fill up the badge of honour To Tudor bear the golden Hirlas Now to Moreiddeg who with his brother assisted our cause valour set  upon their brows like wolves they sought for blood These are my chiefs  Let the golden Hirlas go round to the seat of Morgan whose name shall be heard in the songs of our children the sight of his useless sword blasted my soul  Fill up the badge of honour the golden Hirlas To Gronwys bear it astonished I saw him stand like a rock on the spreading plain of Giveshun he sustained the assault of an army Upon the sandy bank of the sea his attendants did wonders The chief of the foe was burnt in the fire of his rage and the gleanings of the sword were lost in the stream  In the heat of the battle the son of Gryffydh burst his chains Menrig again raged in the war When the sun sat on the hill we sung the song of victory  Fill the Hirlas of mirth to all the chiefs of Oweyn who are the wolves of the mountain Madoc and Meyler are in soul one they are our castles The warriors of the hill stood round their chief  strong as the spear of Uther swift in pursuit as the vapours of the night  Fill the Hirlas with mead Let us drink to the honour of the warriors who fell in the war  Bear it to Daniel beauteous as the verdure of the forest savage as the prowling wolf  O cupbearer great is thy service in displaying the merits of the warrior if thou hast not heard his fame his spear flies to thy breast and his followers drink thy blood  Whilst the lamps of joy are burning let the Hirlas go round to the warriors who fought at Llydcomb they fought with the rage of lions the mead is their due they defended Cwrys  Let the Hirlas go round May the Ruler of all send us liberty and life  D B  Bristol  Jan  GORTHMUND TRANSLATED FROM THE SAXON  THE loud winds whistled through the sacred grove of Thor far over the plains of Denania were the cries of the spirits heard The howl of Hubba's horrid voice swelled upon every blast and the shrill shriek of the fair Locabara shot through the midnightsky  Gorthmund slept on his couch of purple the blood of the slain was still on his cruel hand his helmet was stained with purple and the banner of his father was no more white His soul shuddered at the howl of Hubba and the shrill shriek of Locabara he shook like the trembling reed when the loud tempest rolls the foaming flood over the pointed rocks pale was his face as the eglantine which climbs the branches of the slowery bramble He started from his couch his black locks stood upright on his head like the spears which stand round the tent of the warriors when the silver moon spangles on the tranquil lake  Why wilt thou torment me Hubba it was not by my hand that the sword drank thy blood Who saw me plunge the dagger to the heart of Locabara No Nardin of the forest was far away Cease cease thy shrieks I cannot bear them On thy own sword thou hast thy death and the fair virgin of the hills fell beneath the rage of the mountains Leave me leave me witness Hel  Hela  or  Hel  was the idol of the Danes not as some authors falsely aslert of the Saxons He was the god of battle and victory It is worthy remark that every pagan deity of the northern nations had his symbol or type under which he was worshipped The type of Hel was a black raven hence the Danish standard was a raven The symbol of Woden was a dragon which was the standard of the Saxons in general and the arms of Wessex  I knew not Locabara I forced her not to my embraces no I slew her not she fell by the mountaincers Leave me leave me O soul of Hubba  Exmundbert who bore the  The office of shieldbearer was very ancient and honourable the leaders of armies had generally three shieldbearers one to bear the shield painted or engraved with the symbol of the god and the others were employed to sound the shields of alarm  silver shield of Gorthmund flew from his downy couch swift as  the rumour of a coming host He struck the golden cup and the king of the flying warriors awakened from his dream of terror Exmundbert is he gone Strike the silver shield call up the sons of battle who sleep on the mossy banks of Frome But stay 'tis all a vision 'tis over and gone as the image of Woden in the evening of a summerday Hence to thy tent I will sleep again  Gorthmund doubled his purple robe and slept again  Loud as the noise of a broken rock breaking down the caverns of Seoggeswaldscyre  Seoggeswaldscyre from Seggeswald where Ethelbald the ninth king of the Mercians and fifteenth monarch of England was slain in an insurrection of his subjects This poem is certainly older than Alfred's time and is among numerous others a proof that the division of England into shires was not introduced by that glorious monarch  was the voice of Hubba heard sharp as the cry of the bird of death at the window of the wounded warrior  when the red rays of the morning rise breaking from the east and the soul of the sick is flying away with the darkness was the shriek of Locabara Rise from thy couch Gorthmund thou wolf of the evening When the sun shines in the glory of the day when the labouring swain dances in the woodland shade when the sparkling stars glimmer in the azure of the night and contentment sleeps under the rustic roof thou shalt have no rest Thine are the bitter herbs of affliction for thee shall the wormwood shed its seed on the blossoms of the blooming flower and imbitter with its falling leaves the waters of the brook Rise Gorthmund rise the Saxons are burning thy tents rise for the Mercians are assembled together and thy armies will be slain with the sword or burnt in the image of  The pagan Saxons had a most inhuman custom of burning their captives alive in a wicker image of their god Tewisk Whilst this horrid sacrifice was performing they shouted and danced round the flames  Tewisk The god of victory shall be red with thy blood and they shall shout at the sacrifice Rise Gorthmund thy eyes shall be closed in peace no more  The king of the swift warriors started from his couch he shook like an oak through which the lightnings have cut their rapid way his eyes rolled like the lights on the Saxons barks in the tempest of the dark and black night  Exmundbert flew to his chief he struck the silver shield Sueno of the dark lake and the black haired Lecolwin caught the lance and the shield and prest into the royal tent  Warriors strike the shields of alarm the Mercians are assembled together the Saxons are burning our tents give the cry of war and issue to the battle come upon them by the side of the thick wood near the city of  Rowcester in Derbyshire a place of

their walls The leaders returned  There is no enemy near O king still as the habitation of the dead are the kingdoms around us they have felt the strength of thy arm and will no more rise up to oppose us As the grass falls by the hand of the mower so shall they fall before us and be no more The banner Reafan shall be exalted and the seven gods of the Saxons be trampled in the dust Let the armies of

Ribible  among the AngloSaxons was an instrument not unlike a violin but played on with the fingers  instrument of sacrifice Confused as the cry of the fleet dogs when the white bear is pursued over the mountains of the north confused as the resolutions of terror was the noise of the warriors They danced till the mantle of midnight ascended from the earth  The morning shook the dew from her crown of roses on the yellow locks of the dancers and the gleams of light shot through the dark grey sky like the reeking blood over the shield of steel See warriors a dark cloud sits on the mountain's brow

will rain but in showers of blood For the dark cloud is  the army of  A Mercian of this name commanded the army of Offa and a nobleman named Sigebert was of great account in the court of Brightrick king of Essex  Segowald he leads the flower of the warriors of Mercia and on his right hand is the mighty son of battle the great Sigebert who leads the warriors of Wessex  The dance was ended and the captives of sacrifice bound to the sacred tree they panted in the pangs of death  Sudden from the borders of the wood was the alarm given and the silver shield rouzed the sun from behind the black clouds The archers of the sacrifice dropped the bow and caught the lance and the shield Confusion spread from watchtower to watchtower and the clamour rung to the distant hills  Gorthmund raged like a wild boar but he raged in vain his whole army was disordered and the cry of war was mixed with the yell of retreat  Segowald came near with his Mercians on the righthand and the great Sigebert led the Saxons round the thick wood  The Danes rage like the tempest of winter but the Mercians stand firm as the grove of oaks on the plains of  Ambrosbury in Wiltshire where Alfritha wife to king Edgar built a nunnery to atone for the murder of her soninlaw Edward In this place Eleanor queen to Henry the Third lived a nun  Ambroisburgh great is the strength of the swift warriors of the north but their troops are broken and out of the order of battle  The Saxons with the great Sigebert have incircled the wood they rage in the fight like wolves The Danes are pressed on all sides they fly like the leaves in autumn before the strong wind  Gorthmund scorns to fly he is descended from the son of battle L'achollan whose sword put to flight the armies of Moeric when the sun was covered with a mantle of blood and darkness descended upon the earth at noon day He bears upon his arm the shield of Lofgar the keeper of the  castle of Teigne Lofgar never fled though the lances of the foe flew about him numerous as the winged ants in summer Lofgar never fled though the warriors of the mountains hurled the rocks upon him in the valley when he fought for the shield of Penda and should Gorthmund fly Gorthmund whose sword was his law who held justice in his banner  Segowald sought Gorthmund he found him singly encountering an army  Turn to me son of Lofgar I am Segowald of the lake hast thou not heard of my fame in battle When the army of Hengist panted on the darkbrown heath I cheared them to the war and the banner of victory waved over my head Turn thy arms upon me Gorthmund I am worthy thy strength  The son of Lofgar rushed to the son of Alderwold they fought like the children of destruction on the plain of Marocan Gorthmund fell He fell like the mountain boar beneath the arrow of the hunter  As the shades of death danced before his eyes he heard the yell of Hubba and the shrill shriek of Locabara Thou art fallen thou son of injustice thou art fallen thy shield is degraded in the dust and thy banner will be honoured no more Thy swift warriors are fled over the plain as the driving sheep before the wolf Think Gorthmund think on Hubba the son of Crinewalch of the green hill Think on Locabara whom thy sword sent to the regions of death Remember thy injustice and die  NARVA AND MORED AN AFRICAN ECLOGUE  RECITE the loves of Narva and Mored  The priest of Chalma's triple idol said  High from the ground the youthful warriors sprung  Loud on the concave shell the lances rung  In all the mystic mazes of the dance  The youths of Banny's burning sands advance  Whilst the soft virgin panting looks behind  And rides upon the pinions of the wind  Ascends the mountains brow and measures round  The steepy cliffs of Chalma's sacred ground  Chalma the god whose noisy thunders fly  Thro' the dark covering of the midnight sky  Whose arm directs the closeembattled host  And sinks the labouring vessels on the coast  Chalma whose excellence is known from far  From Lupa's rocky hill to Calabar  The guardian god of Afric and the isles  Where Nature in her strongest vigour smiles  Where the blue blosson of the forky thorn  Bends with the nectar of the op'ning morn  Where ginger's aromatic matted root  Creep through the mead and up the mountains shoot  Three times the virgin swimming on the breeze  Danc'd in the shadow of the mystic trees  When like a dark cloud spreading to the view  The firstborn sons of war and blood pursue  Swift as the elk they pour along the plain  Swift as the flying clouds distilling rain  Swift as the boundings of the youthful roe  They course around and lengthen as they go  Like the long chain of rocks whose summits rise  Far in the sacred regions of the skies  Upon whose top the black'ning tempest lours  Whilst down its side the gushing torrent pours  Like the long cliffy mountains which extend  From Lorbar's cave to where the nations end  Which sink in darkness thick'ning and obscure  Impenetrable mystic and impure  The flying terrors of the war advance  And round the sacred oak repeat the dance  Furious they twist around the gloomy trees  Like leaves in autumn twirling with the breeze  So when the splendor of the dying day  Darts the red lustre of the wat'ry way  Sudden beneath Toddida's whistling brink  The circling billows in wild eddies sink  Whirl furious round and the loud bursting wave  Sinks down to Chalma's sacerdotal cave  Explores the palaces on Zira's coast  Where howls the warsong of the chieftain's ghost  Where the artificer in realms below  Gilds the rich lance or beautifies the bow  From the young palmtree spins the useful twine  Or makes the teeth of elephants divine  Where the pale children of the feeble sun  In search of gold thro' every climate run  From burning heat to freezing torments go  And live in all vicissitudes of woe  Like the loud eddies of Toddida's sea  The warriors circle the mysterious tree  'Till spent with exercise they spread around  Upon the op'ning blossoms of the ground  The priestess rising sings the sacred tale  And the loud chorus echoes thro' the dale  PRIESTESS  Far from the burning sands of Calabar  Far from the lustre of the morning star  Far from the pleasure of the holy morn  Far from the blessedness of Chalma's horn  Now rest the souls of Narva and Mored  Laid in the dust and number'd with the dead  Dear are their memories to us and long  Long shall their attributes be known in song  Their lives were transient as the meadow flow'r  Ripen'd in ages wither'd in an hour  Chalma reward them in his gloomy cave  And open all the prisons of the grave  Bred to the service of the godhead's throne  And living but to serve his God alone  Narva was beauteous as the op'ning day  When on the spangling waves the sunbeams play  When the Mackaw ascending to the sky  Views the bright splendor with a steady eye  Tall as the house of Chalma's dark retreat  Compact and firm as Rhadal Ynca's fleet  Compleatly beauteous as a summers sun  Was Narva by his excellence undone  Where the soft Togla creeps along the meads  Thro' scented Calamus and fragrant reeds  Where the sweet Zinsa spreads its matted bed  Liv'd the still sweeter flow'r the young Mored  Black was her face as Togla's hidden cell  Soft as the moss where hissing adders dwell  As to the sacred court she brought a fawn  The sportive tenant of the spicy lawn  She saw and lov'd And Narva too forgot  His sacred vestment and his mystic lot  Long had the mutual sigh the mutual tear  Burst from the breast and scorn'd confinement there  Existence was a torment O my breast  Can I find accents to unfold the rest  Lock'd in each others arms from Hyga's cave  They plung'd relentless to a wat'ry grave  And falling murmur'd to the pow'rs above  "Gods Take our lives unless we live to love"  C  Shoreditch  May  THE DEATH OF NICOU AN AFRICAN ECLOGUE  ON Tiber's banks Tiber whose waters glide  In slow meanders down to Gaigra's side  And circling all the horrid mountain round  Rushes impetuous to the deep profound  Rolls o'er the ragged rocks with hideous yell  Collects its waves beneath the earth's vast shell  There for a while in loud confusion hurl'd  It crumbles mountains down and shakes the world  Till borne upon the pinions of the air  Through the rent earth the bursting waves appear  Fiercely propell'd the whiten'd billows rise  Break from the cavern and ascend the skies  Then lost and conquer'd by superior force  Through hot Arabia holds its rapid course  On Tiber's banks where scarlet jass'mines bloom  And purple aloes shed a rich perfume  Where when the sun is melting in his heat  The reeking tygers find a cool retreat  Bask in the sedges lose the sultry beam  And wanton with their shadows in the stream  On Tiber's banks by sacred priests rever'd  Where in the days of old a god appear'd  'Twas in the dead of night at Chalma's feast  The tribe of Alra slept around the priest  He spoke as evening thunders bursting near  His horrid accents broke upon the ear  Attend Alraddas with your sacred priest  This day the sun is rising in the east  The sun which shall illumine all the earth  Now now isrising in a mortal birth  He vanish'd like a vapour of the night  And sunk away in a faint blaze of light  Swift from the branches of the holy oak  Horror confusion fear and torment broke  And still when Midnight trims her mazy lamp  They take their way thro' Tiber's wat'ry swamp  On Tiber's banks close rank'd a warring train  Stretch'd to the distant edge of Galca's plain  So when arriv'd at Gaigra's highest steep  We view the wide expansion of the deep  See in the gilding of her wat'ry robe  The quick declension of the circling globe  From the blue sea a chain of mountains rise  Blended at once with water and with skes  Beyond our sight in vast extension curl'd  The check of waves the guardians of the world  Strong were the warriors as the ghost of Cawn  Who threw the Hillofarchers to the lawn  When the soft earth at his appearance fled  And rising billows play'd around his head  When a strong tempest rising from the main  Dash'd the full clouds unbroken on the plain  Nicou immortal in the sacred song  Held the red sword of war and led the strong  From his own tribe the sable warriors came  Well try'd in battle and well known in fame  Nicou descended from the god of war  Who liv'd coeval with the morning star  Narada was his name who cannot tell  How all the world thro' great Narada fell  Vichon the god who rul'd above the skies  Look'd on Narada but with envious eyes  The warrior dar'd him ridicul'd his might  Bent his white bow and summon'd him to fight  Vichon disdainful bade his lightnings fly  And scatter'd burning arrows in the sky  Threw down a star the armour of his feet  To burn the air with supernat'ral heat  Bid a loud tempest roar beneath the ground  Lifted the sea and all the earth was drown'd  Narada still escap'd a sacred tree  Lifted him up and bore him thro' the sea  The waters still ascending fierce and high  He tower'd into the chambers of the sky  There Vichon sat his armour on his bed  He thought Narada with the mighty dead  Before his seat the heavenly warrior stands  The lightning quiv'ring in his yellow hands  The god astonish'd dropt hurl'd from the shore  He drop'd to torments and to rise no more  Headlong he falls 'tis his own arms compel  Condemn'd in everburning fires to dwell  From this Narada mighty Nicou sprung  The mighty Nicou furious wild and young  Who led th'em battled archers to the field  And bore a thunderbolt upon his shield  That shield his glorious father died to gain  When the white warriors fled along the plain  When the full sails could not provoke the flood  Till Nicou came and swell'd the seas with blood  Slow at the end of his robust array  The mighty warrior pensive took his way  Against the son of Nair the young Rorest  Once the companion of his youthful breast  Strong were the passions of the son of Nair  Strong as the tempest of the evening air  Insatiate in desire fierce as the boar  Firm in resolve as Cannie's rocky shore  Long had the gods endeavour'd to destroy  All Nicou's friendship happiness and joy  They sought in vain 'till Vicat Vichon's son  Never in feats of wickedness outdone  Saw Nica sister to the mountain king  Drest beautiful with all the flowers of spring  He saw and scatter'd poison in her eyes  From limb to limb in varied forms he flies  Dwelt on her crimson lip and added grace  To every glossy feature of her face  Rorest was fir'd with passion at the sight  Friendship and honour sunk to Vicat's right  He saw he lov'd and burning with desire  Bore the soft maid from brother sister sire  Pining with sorrow Nica faded died  Like a fair aloe in its morning pride  This brought the warrior to the bloody mead  And sent to young Rorest the threat'ning reed  He drew his army forth Oh Need I tell  That Nicou conquer'd and the lover fell  His breathless army mantled all the plain  And Death sat smiling on the heaps of slain  The battle ended with his reeking dart  The pensive Nicou pierc'd his beating heart  And to his mourning valiant warriors cry'd  I and my sister's ghost are satisfy'd  BrookeStreet  June  ELEGY To the Memory of Mr THOMAS PHILLIPS of  Fairford  NO more I hail the morning's golden gleam  No more the wonders of the view I sing  Friendship requires a melancholy theme  At her command the awful lyre I string  Now as I wander thro' this leafless grove  Where the dark vapours of the ev'ning rise  How shall I teach the chorded shell to move  Or stay the gushing torrents from my eyes  Philips great master of the boundless lyre  Thee would the grateful muse attempt to paint  Give me a double portion of thy fire  Or all the pow'rs of language are too faint  Say what bold number what immortal line  The image of thy genius can reflect  O lend my pen what animated thine  To shew thee in thy native glories deckt  The joyous charms of Spring delighted saw  Their beauties doubly glaring in thy lay  Nothing was Spring which Phillips did not draw  And ev'ry image of his muse was May  So rose the regal hyacinthal star  So shone the pleasant rustic daisied bed  So seem'd the woodlands less'ning from afar  You saw the real prospect as you read  Majestic Summer's blooming flow'ry pride  Next claim'd the honour of his nervous song  He taught the stream in hollow trills to glide  And lead the glories of the year along  When golden Autumn wreath'd in ripen'd corn  From purple clusters press'd the foamy wine  Thy genius did his sallow brows adorn  And made the beauties of the season thine  Pale rugged Winter bending o'er his tread  His grizzled hair bedropt with ioy dew  His eyes a dusky light congeal'd and dead  His robe a tinge of bright etherial blue  His train a motley'd sanguine sable cloud  He limps along the russet dreary moor  Whilst rising whirlwinds blasting keen and loud  Roll the white surges to the sounding shore  Nor were his pleasures unimprov'd by thee  Pleasures he has tho' horridly deform'd  The silver'd hill the polish'd lake we see  Is by thy genius fix'd preserv'd and warm'd  The rough November has his pleasures too  But I'm insensible to every joy  Farewel the laurel now I grasp the yew  And all my little powers in grief employ  In thee each virtue found a pleasing cell  Thy mind was honour and thy soul divine  With thee did ev'ry power of genius dwell  Thou wert the Helicon of all the nine  Fancy whose various figuretinctur'd vest  Was ever changing to a different hue  Her head with varied bays and flow'rets drest  Her eyes two spangles of the morning dew  In dancing attitude she swept thy string  And now she soars and now again descends  And now reclining on the Zephyr's wing  Unto the velvetvested mead she bends  Peace deck'd in all the softness of the dove  Over thy passions spread her silver plume  The rosy vale of harmony and love  Hung on thy soul in one eternal bloom  Peace gentlest softest of the virtues spread  Her silver pinions wet with dewy tears  Upon her best distinguish'd poet's head  And taught his lyre the music of the spheres  Temp'rance with health and beauty in her train  And massymuscled Strength in graceful pride  Pointed at scarlet Luxury and Pain  And did at every chearful feast preside  Content who smiles at all the frowns of fate  Fann'd from idea ev'ry seeming ill  In thy own virtue and thy genius great  The happy muse laid anxious troubles still  But see The sick'ned glare of day retires  And the meek ev'ning shades the dusky grey  The west faint glimmers with the saffron fires  And like thy life O Phillips dies away  Here stretch'd upon this heav'n ascending hill  I'll wait the horrors of the coming night  I'll imitate the gentlyplaintive rill  And by the glare of lambent vapours write  Wet with the dew the yellow'd hawthorns bow  The loud winds whistle thro' the echoing dell  Far o'er the lea the breathing cattle low  And the shrill shriekings of the screechowl swell  With rustling sound the dusky foliage flies  And wantons with the wind in rapid whirls  The gurg'ling riv'let to the valley hies  And lost to sight in dying murmurs curls  Now as the mantle of the ev'ning swells  Upon my mind I feel a thick'ning gloom  Ah Could I charm by friendship's potent spells  The soul of Phillips from the deathy tomb  Then would we wander thro' the dark'ned vale  In converse such as heav'nly spirits use  And borne upon the plumage of the gale  Hymn the Creator and exhort the muse  But horror to reflection Now no more  Will Phillips sing the wonder of the plain  When doubting whether they might not adore  Admiring mortals heard the nervous strain  A mad'ning darkness reigns thro' all the lawn  Naught but a doleful bell of death is heard  Save where into an hoary oak withdrawn  The scream proclaims the curst nocturnal bird  Now rest my muse but only rest to weep  A friend made dear by every sacred tye  Unknown to me be comfort peace or sleep  Phillips is dead 'tis pleasure then to die  FEBRUARY AN ELEGY  BEGIN my muse the imitative lay  Aonian doxies sound the thrumming string  Attempt no number of the plaintive Gay  Let me like midnight cats or Collins sing  If in the trammels of the doleful line  The bounding hail or drilling rain descend  Come brooding Melancholy pow'r divine  And ev'ry unform'd mass of words amend  Now the rough goat withdraws his curling horns  And the cold wat'rer twirls his circling mop  Swift sudden anguish darts thro' alt'ring corns  And the spruce mercer trembles in his shop  Now infant authors madd'ning for renown  Extend the plume and hum about the stage  Procure a benefit amuse the town  And proudly glitter in a title page  Now wrapt in ninefold fur his squeamish grace  Defies the fury of the howling storm  And whilst the tempest whistles round his face  Exults to find his mantled carcase warm  Now rumbling coaches furious drive along  Full of the majesty of city dames  Whose jewels sparkling in the gaudy throng  Raise strange emotions and invidious flames  Now Merit happy in the calm of place  To mortals as a Highlander appears  And conscious of the excellence of lace  With spreading frogs and gleaming spangles glares  Whilst Envy on a tripod seated nigh  In form a shoeboy daubs the valu'd fruit  And darting lightnings from his vengeful eye  Raves about Wilkes and politics and Bute  Now Barry taller than a grenadier  Dwindles into a strippling of eighteen  Or sabled in Othello breaks the ear  Exerts his voice and totters to the scene  Now Foote a lookingglass for all mankind  Applies his wax to personal defects  But leaves untouch'd the image of the mind  His art no mental quality reflects  Now Drury's potent king extorts applause  And pit box gallery echo "How divine"  Whilst vers'd in all the drama's mystic laws  His graceful action saves the wooden line  NowBut what further can the muses sing  Now dropping particles of water fall  Now vapours riding on the north wind's wing  With transitory darkness shadow all  Alas How joyless the descriptive theme  When sorrow on the writer's quiet preys  And like a mouse in Cheshire cheese supreme  Devours the substance of the less'ning bayes  Come February lend thy darkest sky  There teach the winter'd muse with clouds to soar  Come February lift the number high  Let the sharp strain like wind thro' alleys roar  Ye channels wand'ring thro' the spacious street  In hollow murmurs roll the dirt along  With inundations wet the sabled feet  Whilst gouts responsive join th'elegiac song  Ye damsels fair whose silver voices shrill  Sound thro' meand'ring folds of Echo's horn  Let the sweet cry of liberty be still  No more let smoking cakes awake the morn  O Winter Put away thy snowy pride  O Spring Neglect the cowslip and the bell  O Summer Throw thy pears and plums aside  O Autumn Bid the grape with poison swell  The pension'd muse of Johnson is no more  Drown'd in a butt of wine his genius lies  Earth Ocean Heav'n The wond'rous loss deplore  The dregs of Nature with her glory dies  What iron Stoic can suppress the tear  What sour reviewer read with vacant eye  What bard but decks his literary bier  Alas I cannot singI howlI cry  D  Bristol  Feb  ELEGY ON W BECKFORD ESQ  WEEP on ye Britonsgive your gen'ral tear  But hence ye venalhence each titled slave

at the rust'ling leaf and rolls his eyes  Aghast with horror when he views the tomb  With every torment of a hell he flies  The bubbling brooks in plantive murmurs roll  The bird of omen with incessant scream  To melancholy thoughts awakes the soul  And lulls the mind to contemplation's dream  A dreary stillness broods o'er all the vale  The clouded moon emits a feeble glare  Joyless I

said to have been written by Thomas Rowlie in the th century having given rise to some ingenious criticisms respecting their authenticity I beg leave to send you the following fragment of a sermon by the same author It was given to me some time since by Mr George Catcott whose name has been so often mentioned on the present occasion and to whose inquisitive disposition and very commendable zeal the public is principally indebted for the preservation and appearance of these valuable productions of antiquity It may be necessary to inform you that when Chatterton gave this fragment to his friend he was utterly and ever after continued unacquainted with any language but his mothertongue and that  the citations of these languages from two antient authors have been fully authenticated The poetical talents of our bard are established by the publication of his poems but the following fragment of a sermon on the divinity of the Holy Spirit displays him in the more illustrious character of an orthodox divine Every circumstance which tends to throw light on the history of Rowlie should be given to the public and his sentiments on so essential a point of the Christian religion by no means suppressed notwithstanding they may not have the sanction of an age unhappily overgrown with Arianism and infidelity Chatterton himself although he totally disbelieved the subject of the fragment had however the ingenuity to produce it and I am sorry that the ingenuous editors had not thought it and some others of Rowlie's prose productions in their possession worthy of being published together with his poetical compositions  Yours c A B  I have been favoured with the perusal of some prose MSS now in Mr Catcot's possession that prove Rowlie's existence beyond the possibility of a doubt

goode man the favouryte of Godde the friende of the chyrche the companyonne of kynges and the sadre of hys natyve cittie"  was a younger son of a citizen of Bristol In his youth he gave early dawnings of wisdom and learning  "As wise as anie of the eldermenne  He'd wytte enowe to make a mayre at tenne"  Story of Mr William Canynge  p    He was also of a comely person but married it seems for love without a fortune Soon after however his father and elder brother who both loved money as much as he despised it died and left him large estates in land and money with his  brother John  Called  Thomas  by Stow in his list of Mayors  dependent upon him on which he founded a chauntry for their souls  "And put hys broder ynto syke a trade  That he Lorde Mayre of Londonne towne was made"  Ibid p  in the year But soon this dawning was overcast by the death of his wife his second self Of his native city he was mayor five times and beside several other charities founded an almshouse or hospital which is yet in being at Redcliffhill and built a chapel and that noble church of St Mary Redcliff the finest parishchurch in England  "The maystrie of a human hande  The pryde of Brystowe and the Westerne lande"  On our Ladies Chyrche  When Sir Baldwin Fulford was executed at Bristol for treason in Edward IV Canynge being then mayor made great intercession  for him to the King  Then Maister Canynge sou  the Kinge  And telle down onne hys knee  "I'm come" qu  d he "unto your Grace  To move your clemencye"  The Deathe of Syr Charles Bawdin  who heard him graciously having been much his friend though he would not grant his request When he was knighted does not appear Rowley has dedicated to him his tragedy of Aella in two epistles To that of Godwyn Canynge wrote the prologue an  in it acted the part of King Edward the Confessor Four poems of his are also printed with Rowley's In a second match being proposed by the King between him and a lady of the Wi  eville the Queen's family Sir William went into orders purposely to avoid it being ordained acolythe by his friend Bishop Carpenter  Rowley in his dedication of Aella says  "Goode Byshoppe Carpynter dyd byd mee  ie  He wys  he you healthe and f  linesse  Happiness  for aie"  of Worcester th of September and receiving the higher orders of subdeacon deacon and priest  th of March the d and th of April respectively Being then made dean of the collegiate church of Westbury Wilts with his usual munificence he rebuilt that college Soon after his taking orders he gave by a deed of trust dated th of October in part of a benefaction of l to St Mary Redcliff church  "  certain jewels  of Sir Theobald Gorges  Sir Theobald Gorges was a Knight of an ancient family seated at Wraxhall within a few miles of Bristol See  Rot Parl  H VI n Leland's Itin Vol vii p He was an actor in both Rowley's tragedies and wrote one of the  Mynsirelles Songes  in Aella p "Rowley Iscamm and  T  b Gorges  " are mentioned by Canynge as three of his  ends in his "Accounte of his Feast"  Knt"  which had been pawned to him for l  Full of good works he died in the year and was buried in Redcliff church where two monuments were erected to his memory one with his effigies in the robes of a magistrate the other in those of a priest cut in white marble Besides his many other charitable donations he settled lands to pay l  per annum  to the sheriffs  in lieu of toll demanded by them at the city gates For an account of the chests deposited by him in Redcliff church see pp  Sir W Canynge had also a cabinet of curiosities which he had collected with very great expence and Rowley assisted him in making the collection The greatest part of a large folio was filled with his compositions This folio Rowley says  "was a presente wordie of a grete kynge"  and the loss of it will be sincerely regretted by the friends of literature as the writings might have thrown some light on the learning of those times Canynge was also a man of an extensive genius and a liberal turn of mind the distinguished patron of literature and a lover of the fine arts Rowley it appears by his writings lived in the greatest intimacy with him and received very extraordinary marks of his favour and generosity On all occasions he shews his gratitude to his illustrious friend takes perpetual delight in dwelling on his many amiable virtues and constanly manifests an earnest desire of transmitting his fame to posterity This appears not only in many of his poems but also in the following prose work preserved by  Chatterton and printed in the Town andCountry Magazine for Nov which as a literary curiosity our readers we doubt not will be glad to see republished here with several corrections For other particulars of this Maecenas of the Bristol Virgil they must wait till Mr Barrett favours the world with his history of that city  Some farther Account of this extraordinary Person written by  Rowley  the Priest  "I was fadre confessor to masteres Roberte and mastre William Cannings Mastre Robert was a man after his fadre's own harte greedie of gaynes and sparynge of alms deedes but master William was mickle courteous and gave me many marks in my needs At the age of years deaces'd master Roberte and by master William's desyre bequeathd me one hundred marks I went to thank master William for his mickle courtesie and to make tender

might have bargaynd marks better but master William would not part with it The prior of Coventree did sell me a picture of great account made by Badilian Y'allyanne who did live in the reign of Kynge

Cannings my Bristow tragedy for which he gave me in hands twentie pounds and did praise it more then I did think my self did deserve for I can say in troth I was never proud of my verses since I did read master Chaucer and now haveing nought to do and not wyling to be ydle I went to the minster of our Ladie and Saint Goodwin and then did purchase the Saxon manuscripts and sett my selfe

and hospitality Though not wholly neglected now it cannot boast of the honours it once had the veneration for religious seasons fled with popery and old English hospitality is long since deceased Our modern playthings of fortune who make the whole year a revolution of dissipation and joyless festivity cannot distinguish this season unless by resting from their laborious pleasures and if they can think find a happy serenity in solitude and reflection unknown in the tumult of hurricanesThe ancient Christmas gambols were in my opinion superior to our modern spectacles and amusements wrestling hurling the ball and dancing in the woodlands were pleasures for men it is true the conversation of the hearthfide was the tales of superstition  the fairies Robin Goodfellow and hobgoblins never failed to make the trembling audience mutter an Ave Maria and cross their chins but the laughable exercises of blindman's buff riddling and question and command sufficiently compensated for the sew sudden starts of terror Add to these amusements the wretched voices of the chanters and sub chanters howling carols in Latin the chiming of consecrated bells the burning consecrated wax candles curiously representing the Virgin Mary praying the saint whose monastery stood nearest the munching consecrated crossloaves sold by the monks all which effectually eradicated the spectres of their terrific stories Nor were these the only charms against the foul fiends and nightmare sleeping crosslegged like the effigies of Knights Templars and warriors and the holy bush and churchyard yew were certain antidotes against those invisible beings After this representation I may be thought partial to my own hobbyhorse as an antiquary in giving the preference to the amusements of the days of old but let the sentimental reader consider that the tales of superstition when believed affect the soul with a sensation pleasurably  horrid we may paint in more lively colours to the eye they spoke to the heart  The great barons and knights usually kept open house during this season when their villains or vassals were entertained with bread beef and beer and a pudding wastol cake or Christmas kitchel and a groat in silver at parting being obliged in return to wave the full flaggon round their heads in honour of the master of the house Sometimes the festival continued till Twelfthday when the baron or his steward took the deis or upper seat of the table and after dinner gave every man a new gown of his livery and two Christmas kitchelsThis kind of liberality endeared the barons to the common people and made them ever ready to take up arms under their banners  A register of the nunnery of Keynsham relates that William earl of Glocester entertained two hundred knights with tilts and fortunys at his great manor of Keynsham provided thirty pies of the eels of Avon as a curious dainty and on the Twelfthday began the plays for the knights  by the monks with miracles and maumeries for the henchmen and servants by minstrels  Here is plainly a distinction made between maumeries and miracles and the more noble representations comprehended under the name plays The first were the holiday entertainments of the vulgar the other of the barons and nobility The private exhibitions at the manors of the barons were usually family histories the monk who represented the master of the family being arrayed in a tabard or herald's coat without sleeves painted with all the hatchments of the names In these domestic performances absurdities were unavoidable and in a play wrote by Sir Tibbet Gonges Constance countess of Bretagne and Richmond marries and buries her three husbands in the compass of an hour Sometimes these pieces were merely relations and had only two characters of this kind as that in Weever's Funeral monuments None but the patrons of monasteries had the service of the monks in performing plays on holidays provided the same contained nothing against God or the church The public exhibitions were superior to the private the plot generally the life of some pope or the  founder of the abbey the monks belonged to I have seen several of these pieces mostly Latin and cannot think our ancestors so ignorant of dramatic excellence as the generality of modern writers would represent they had a good moral in view and some of the maumeries abound with wit which though low now was not so then Minstrels jesters and mummers was the next class of performers every knight had two or thee minstrels and jesters who were maintained in his house to entertain his family in their hours of dissipation these Chancer mentions in the following passages  Doe comme he saied myn mynstrales  And jestours for to tellen us tales  Anon in mye armyage  Of Romaunces yatto

Chancer had distributed copies of the tale of Piers Plowman a Franciscan friar wrote a satiric maumery upon him which was acted at the monasteries in London and at Woodstock before the court Chancer not a little nettled at the poignancy and popularity of the satire meeting his antagonist in Fleetstreet beat him with his dagger for which he was fined two shillings as appears by a record of the Inner Temple where Chancer was a student  ANECDOTE CONCERNING LORD JEFFRIES  A Few months before the abdication of the dastardly tyrant James II lord chancellor Jeffries of detested memory went to Arundel in Sussex in order to influence an election He took his residence at the castle and went the day fixed for the election to the townhall where Mr Peckam who was then mayor of Arundel held his court Jeffries had the impudence to shew his bloody face there the mayor ordered him to withdraw immediately and in case of refusal threatened to have him committed  "You"  said he  "who ought to be the guardian of our laws and of our sacred constitution shall not so audaciously violate them This is my court and my jurisdiction here is above yours"  Jeffries who was not willing to perplex still more the king's assairs and to enrage the populace retired immediately The next morning he invited Peckham to breakfast with him which he accepted but he had the courage to scorn to take a place which the merciless executioner offered him  Taken from the Records of the Town of Arundel  To the  Printer  of the  Town  and  Country  MAGAZINE  SIR  BEING a little curious in antiquities I have found

the Statue ordered to be erected to the Memory of the late  William Beckford  Esq by the Court of Common Council  EXPLANATION  Mr  Beckford  in his Robes as Lord Mayor treading on  Tyranny  and supporting  Britannia  who in a recumbent distressed Posture looks up to him as imploring his Assistance On an Altar on which are the Arms of the City of  London  the Address surmounted with the Cap of  Liberty  and the City Regalia the Sword resting on  Magna Charta  encircled with Laurel  SCULPTURE is an art which by design and solid matter imitates the palpable objects of nature It is difficult to ascertain the epocha of  its origin it is lost in the most remote antiquity The arts of imitation in general as painting architecture sculpture c where the first invented Sculptors began to work upon clay and wax which are more flexible and more pliable than wood and stone They soon made statues of trees which were neither subject to corruption nor worms as the lemontree the cypress the palm the olive the ebony and the vine at last they made use of metals ivory and the hardest stones marble especially became the most precious matter and the most esteemed for works of sculpture  The nations amongst which this fine art was in the greatest honour were the Aegyptians those people so celebrated by the monuments of their gratitude towards the memory of the kings their benefactors It was to perpetuate their names that they erected in the earliest ages the two Colossean statues of Mocrus and the queen his spouse  The Aegyptian sculptors excelled all others in exactness of proportion the different parts of a statue were often formed by divers artists and these parts united made the whole perfect  The Greek historians boast of the invention of that art in their country which they attribute to love however it is certain that the first essays of sculpture in Greece were very unpolished but Dedalus having travelled into Aegypt improved himself in this art and formed afterwards pupils who became the admiration of a people whose taste was not yet refined by the elegant statues of Phydias Myron Lysippus c  The Greeks subdued by the Romans degenerated insensibly and the arts vanished with their freedom  Sculpture was an exotic which never could thrive in victorious Rome its transient glory was eclipsed by the other arts in the reign of Augustus it declined under Tiberius Caius and Claudius and reappeared with an enormous magnitude under Nero  The Gothic sculpture sprung afterwards from a wild imagination unassisted by nature  The epocha of sculpture is the same in France and Italy The celebrated Michael Angelo worked  in Rome under the pontificate of Leo X whilst John Goujon was admitted at Paris under the patronage of Francis I  The English advanced by slow degrees to the perfection of that art in which they now rival their ancient masters  The sculptors gave the name of statue to a figure in embossed work that stands by itself in wood stone marble or metal of persons conspicuous by their birth their rank or their merit  The ancients often represented figures of men kings and even gods under a species of statues smaller than the natural size  Those of persons who had distinguished themselves by their superior knowledge their virtues or some important services to the commonwealth were erected at the public expence in statues of human size  The third species of statues was designed for kings and emperors they were taller than men  commonly are and those which personated heroes were larger in proportion  As for the Colossean statues they represented gods and often kings and emperors desirous to magnify themselves by these stupendous works reared at their own expence monuments of their vanity and folly  An equestrian statue exhibits a man on horseback as the statue of Charles I at Charingcross the statue of Henry IV at Paris and that of Cosmo de Medicis at Leghorn  A Greek statue is naked and antique thus called because the Greeks displayed in that manner the gods the heroes and the athlets of the Olympic games  The Roman statues are all represented with a drapery  A mausoleum is a pompous funeral monument decorated with sculpture and architecture with an epitaph sacred to the memory of some considerable personage It derives its etymology from the  magnificent tomb which Queen Artemisa caused to be erected for Mausolus king of Caria her husband  Heroes patriots and statesmen are not only entitled to the love and veneration of their cotemporaries during their lives but their virtues and services ought to be transmitted to the latest posterity This vanity of surviving our dust by lasting monuments of national gratitude has prompted men to the most noble actions and inspired them with the emulation of being enrolled in the records of time with those great heroes whose statues and inscriptions they contemplate with a sort of extacy The tombs of Westminsterabbey fill the mind with that awful reverence which a magnificent and grateful nation testifies for its benefactors The portraits of the illustrious warriors who have subdued our inveterate enemies in both hemisphered exposed to public view in Vauxhallgardens create even in a dissipated multitude a kind of admiration greatly superior to that inspired by the enchantment of the place The spirit and magnamanity of the incorruptible Beckford so becoming the first magistrate of the metropolis of a powerful empire his noble and animated speech  to the throne which was the last public testimony of his unwearied zeal for his country's cause will be echoed with applause at the sight of his statue by the succeeding generation to whom he tried to transmit our constitution restored to its pristine purity  ADVENTURES OF A STAR  I Shall omit the minute passages of my life which happened whilst my members were in a state of separation and begin my history where I began to see the polite worldin the laceman's shop My possessor was a substantial man and of some account among the monied men at Jonathan's He was accounted a wit at his club at the Robinhood which was not then altogether as patriotic as it is now no Cato being permitted to mount the table and harangue himself into an asthma Here I lived in a state of inactivity for above a month and heard nothing but the usual discourse of trade when one day a couple of pretty ladies hurried into the shop from a coach dignified with a coronet  "Well Mr Spangle we want to take a view of the newest patterns you have Lord my dear and is the wretch really jealous"  "Quite mad 'pon honour Don't you think this pattern very pretty Why he had the impudence to declare that I  should receive no more visits from the colonel"  "An amazing pretty stomacher pray what is the price And I hope you answered him like a woman of quality and spirit"  "Certainly my dear"  "Fifty guineas Mr Spangle Well let me have it and book it to lord Gr I will never disgrace my title"  "But my dear Harriot I have reason to fear his jealousy will veer round to the right object"  "Reason to fear my dear what an expression is that for a woman of quality You have reason to fear nothing but his interrupting your happiness"  "And that I defy him to do Here Harry take the trifles Yours Mr Spangle"  And away drove the titular honourables whom I heard no more of till my exaltation among the quality The next discourse of any consequence happened between Mr Spangle and his son Jack Spangle was as complete a city buck as any who srequent the Park when the sun shines He spoke an anglicised French very sluently and murdered an overture upon the violin to admiration  "Jack said the old gentleman to him one day when the ungracious spendthrift had made application for t'other bank bill these wild courses will never do I hear you have a mistress I don't begrudge it Jack but why will  you pay so confounded dear for her I make allowances you are flesh and blood as well as myself would you had as much prudence as many years have taught me I protest when I was a young fellow I cut as pretty a figure as you with half the expence I used to take a trip into the country hire a good handsome wench as my servant put her into reputable lodgings and buy every thing necessary for her myself and by these means fix her my own at an easy rate Here was the surgeon's bill saved and my constitution kept whole and sound for matrimony if ever fate should throw a wife with ten thousand pounds in my way I made every lady a compliment but seldom accompanied it with any other present than a kiss Would you Jack pursue the same prudent method you would find the benefit of it but I am afraid you are resolved to buy experience dear"  Jack heard this admonition with a sheepishness natural enough to the choice spirits of the city when they are under the rod of correction but the old gentleman producing a bill at the end of his harangue Jack's countenance brightened up he received it and bowing respectfully stammered  out  "'Tis very true Sir as you say Sir"  After lying in the shop three months and four days I always endeavour to be precise in my chronology as it gives the reader assurance that the history is really and  bona fide  true one of my rays by an accident began to be a little tarnished this was a terrible misfortune as in consequence of it I was degraded to the glasscase at the door I now gave way to the most violent emotionsof despair and thought my splendor irretrievable saw all my hopes of rising in the polite world vanished and expected never to be relieved till the day of transmutation from my disgraceful situation But fate had kinder days in store for me The first object that claimed my attention in the street was the superb chair of Mrs Spermacety the waxchandler's wife Her chairmen were loaded with silver lace and the footman who cleared the way had an enormous bag wig I expected to have seen it filled with the dignity of a duchess but how great was my astonishment when I perceived a short fat woman of the same complexion as the sign of the Saracen's Head fastened in it She was dressed meanly rich without the shadow of elegance  in any thing but her chair which had formerly belonged to a lady of quality having purchased it at her decease Her sneaking pitiful countenance did not discover one grain of generosity or nobility she appeared an absolute burlesque on the grandeur which surrounded her The following dialogue between Mr Spangle and his good friend and neighbour Mr Pickle let me into her whole history  "Good morning to you neighbour Spangle as the man said methinks Mrs Spermaceti shines today"  "She shines every day at home and abroad Mr Pickle but there may be reasons for it and the grey mare is sometimes the better horse"  This stroke though in my opinion not very brilliant brought a horselaugh on both sides for about ten minutes  "You are a wit neighbour you are a wit but they say as how that Mrs Spermaceti was formerly her husband's cookmaid but lies and snowballs gather in rolling pray is there any truth in the matter"  "Between ourselves there is a great deal of truth in it and the first charm that Mr Spermaceti found in his spouse was that she dressed ortolans to a miracle"  Another loud laugh of applause echoed to the end of the street  "And they say Mr Spangle as how that she lost three  thousand pounds one night at the gaming table to lord whatyecallumlord Dillitanti is that true"  "Very true upon my word for Tom Shamwell who now lives by his wit stood behind her chair to let him into her hand as they call it"  "Well the Lord help us all it is a sad thing to ha  e a spending wife who consumes all the money before we gets it"  This edifying discourse was terminated by a hearty shake of the hand and an invitation from both parties to partake of a bottle of wine I had now remained exposed to public view for about three weeks and had caught the eye of every staring countryman who did honour to my fallen brightness by exclaiming  "Odzounds what a woundy pretty thingamy"  Fortune at last began to smile and my deliverance from disgrace was effected in the following manner  Father L'Andridella was at the time of the intended assassination of the king of Portugal treasurer to a principal college of the order of Jesus in the city of Lisbon He was the intimate friend and considant of Malagrida and assisted him in composing those ridiculous whimsies which the Inquisition  condemned as heretical He was also deep in the important secret and when the conspiracy began to unravel was happy enough to escape the flames which Malagrida and the other conspirators perished in The inhumanity with which the innocent families of the only two noble conspirators were treated is too shocking to be dwelt upon  Andridella went first to Paris where he was employed by St Florentin to bear certain presents to certain ministers in England on a pacific account but he demanding more for his trouble than St Florentin chose to give he was threatened with being confined for life in the Bastile which threat would have been actually carried into execution had he not timely got away to England  How a certain physician came by his intelligence shall be known in due time  Andridella for reasons best known to himself shifted his habit and equipped himself as a pedlar Being a man of an extensive genius and great knowledge in chemistry he prepared several tinctures for taking spots out of linen recovering  tarnished gold or silver and other ingenious  minutiae  In one of his diurnal rotations he called on Mr Spangle and imparted to him the virtues of his box I was accordingly taken down to bear witness to the excellence of his tincture and on the touch of his brush moistened by it shone forth with redoubled lustre which by a natural sympathy glittered also in the eyes of Mr Spangle Andridella was paid generously and I was once more carefully laid up in the shop but my stay there was very short for Mr Buckram the taylor gave me the preference before twenty of my brethren and fixed me to a magnificent suit of cloaths which were conveyed to Bn house for the use of a young d just stepped into his estate and title  The duke of De was the nobleman upon whose breast I commanded respect Paracelsus and that ingenious astrologic physician Culpeper assert that gold and silver have a magic virtue The magic of this virtue commercially considered is interest physically it is chimerical and metaphisically it is a fine subtle genius or spirit as capable of reasoning upon matter as any deist since Bolingbroke By the magic of my composition  I was enabled to look internally into the bosoms which I adorned externally and had no reason to be dissatisfied with my situation as his grace's heart was no dishonour to his star He was young and had his foibles the principal of which was a strong passion for gaming Reason in vain endeavoured to convince him of his error had he been convinced his resolution would have been too feeble to bear him through in a reformation The first time I adorned him I visited the court after the levee was over he was accosted by Lord Rattle  "Ah De how the devil d'ye do to day I was horridly dipp'd last night thirteen bottles of champaigne demme Lord Shuffle was bit this morning of three thousand and has sent to his steward to cut down a whole forest to have a better stock to proceed upon Pray have you seen Cd's Letters"  "O horrid don't mention the stuff I sicken at the idea Lady Bab Blouzy has had the vapours these five days by perusing as many lines Nauseous 'pon 'onour I always write my billets in French a certain preservative against vulgar criticism"  "Gadso you're right my lord but as I always thought writing pedantic and beneath a nobleman my valet always writes my amorous epistles  and a fine fellow he is too Trims a sentiment like a bagwig and twists a meaning like a curl"  I admired his lordships prudence in making his valet a secretary as it was more than probable he was better qualified for the office than his honourable master  In the evening I accompanied the duke to the gamingtable my lustre sickened and my whole frame trembled at beholding the knot of rascals and villains who surrounded him Some he honoured with a nod and others he condescended to enter into a conversation with and then with an air of careless indifference sat down to play and before he rose lost above eight thousand pounds This loss but very little affected him and he went home with the same composure of mind he brought out with him The sharpers who shared the booty were Sir Richard lord M Jack Hounslow and father Andredilla whose ingenuity had raised me to my present exalted station Sir Richard had a legal claim to his title but no man could disgrace it with more villanies or meannesses His humble soul stooped to every thing when interest was in the way and his tender conscience never gave him any trouble about the matter  Though lord M and this conscientious knight of the post were continually quarrelling every were else they always agreed at the gamingtable in a very capital point viz to bubble his grace His grace was so easy so superficially learned in the art of gambling and his antagonists so cunning and deep in the mystery that Bnhouse was more than once on the verge of being sold to pay these inpostors what the world calls debts of honour Lord M who though young yet enervated with pleasure had still a hankering desire to be sacrificing on the altar of the Cytherean goddess and by the infallibility of a bankbill had gained admittance into the chamber of Miss Rrs the baronet's mistress His lordship was making his addresses when Sir Richard made his appearance as the baronet was a man of prudence and knew how to make use of an opportunity he proposed to his lordship that if he should be permitted to partake of the profits arising from his grace and an eminent EastIndia bubble his lordship should partake in common with the baronet in the charms of Miss Rrs Lord M stretched his gallantry to the utmost and complied and it was upon this consideration that the baronet had admittance to  the gaming table Jack Hounslow was his lordship's understrapper he had been an upholsterer but having squandered his stock and nothing being left but a pair of pistols he employed them to the most profitable advantage by levying contributions on the highway The frequent executions of his fellow labourers striking a damp upon his spirits and having now pretty well recruited his pockets he gave up his hazardous employment and commenced sharper Lord M soon discovered his inventive genius and useful parts and engaged him in his service  Sir Kenelm Digby who so religiously maintained the doctrine of sympathy would have attributed his lordship's discovery to similar feelings in his own breast But as many tedious and learned arguments may be brought to maintain it and to say but little in a case of importance is worse than nothing at all and for other good causes and considerations I shall leave it entirely to the reader  Father Andredilla having acquired a considerable sum by his tinctures put himself into a magnificent dress hired three servants and assuming the title of marquis de Villa Garcia completed the  party who were continually preying upon the inexperience of the duke One morning lord Rattle came thundering in upon his grace  "O De I shall die with risibility Never was such a comical figure demme no masquerade face can be half so laughable There's Cd gone to his trial with a countenance as dejected as lord Be's when at Kingston and lady Harriet Gr with a face as bronzed and as impudent as a naiad of CoventGarden"  "Pretty work Rattle and what d'ye think will be the issue"  "Between you and I I have a very important secret and could I confide in your retentive faculties by the Lord I have no friend upon earth I would rather reveal it to"  "You may depend upon my honour Jack did I ever betray your inestimable secrets"  "Why then De it is absolutely determined that when a divorce is obtained Cd shall positively marry lady Harriet I may confide in your honour now I hope"  "Undoubtedly"  replied his grace smothering a laugh  "your secrets are of too much importance to be trisled with"  Lord Rattle's whispers had generally as much truth as those of a coffeehouse politician who is happy in the acquaintance of a paragraphmaker  I had lived with his grace long enough to see him bubbled out of thirty thousand pounds and was then configned as a customary fee to his valet who immediately carried me to Monmouthstreet to take my chance with an army of decayed gentry some of whom I had been acquainted with in their days of prosperity As I had lived my usual time among the great I submitted to my fate without murmuring A black velvet coat and waistcoat my near neighbours were taken down to give physical dignity to a young fellow who had newly commenced quackdoctor and found out a nostrum to cure distempers which never existed This suit had once adorned a genius of the same profession whose extraordinary operations in Moorfields had made him the envy of all HattonGarden Doctor Bialini the original wearer was quite an Esculapius in his way he was unacquainted with every principle in surgery but having as much courage and impudence as ignorance he boldly undertook the most difficult operations When he happened to divide an artery in the cure of a scratch it was all very well and he had discovered by experience that diverting the distemper to the nobler parts was an infalliable cure for inconsiderable ailments He couched for the  cataract and where he cured one by chance he made twenty totally blind beyond all possibility of recovery But success did not always attend his adventure a young lady of great family applying to him to be eased of a troublesome pain in the head he gave her such a dose of his cathartic pills that she expired under their operation The friends of the deceased accused the doctor of murder and left it to his choice either to take a dose of his own cathartics or leave England to return no more As he knew the merit of his medicaments too well to chuse the first he returned to Italy to exercise his honester occupation of a taylor His solemn habiliments were now disposed of to his successor in fame Mr Perron who had been educated a cobler and on the merit of being twice salivated advertised to cure a certain distemper in all its extensive branches The regular surgeons have had no reason to complain of his success as he has greatly increased the business of the faculty by confirming the disease and ruining the constitution in every patient he undertook to cure The warehouse I was laid up in was greatly frequented by secondhand gentry among whom I heard many entertaining discourses but too foreign from my purpose to be related here  A servant enquiring for a rich suit with a star I was accordingly taken down approved of and carried off I wondered what use I was going to be put to when a meagre tall old man made his appearance  "Well done my bra' bonny laddie this is saving the siller and laying up more for the bairn"  These words were uttered by the identical duke of A who putting on his prudent finery stepped into a coach as antiquated as hospitality and rattled off to court The reception he met with from his M would have shamed virtue out of countenance when we see villany and avarice caressed what shall we say but that ks are men His only merit was in being born a Scot and distantly related to lord B I had examined his breast and found him nothing but a composition of pride fraud and avarice As he was deep in all his favoured countryman's secrets the affair of the peace was not unknown to him and he had no inconsiderable share of the booty Not contented with his share he revealed the transaction to a certain western physician binding him by oath not to discover from whom he had his intelligence and articling to receive a moiety of whatever should be given the doctor to  stop his mouth or say nothing at all to the purpose The whole juggle was transacted entirely to the duke's satisfaction and he partook so gloriously of the hushmoney that for a moment emerging from his usual avarice he gave his servants new liveries and matched one of his horses having before paired a bay and a black one The nobility did not receive him so well as his M as he was universally looked upon as a scandal to his title he was shunned by every polite company Unfortunately the too retentive memory of a gentleman discovered his grace's cloaths to have been worn by a more honourable nobleman and having whispered his discovery to lady Henrietta Fh as a very great secret it was known all over the town before the evening that the duke of A had been to court in the duke of D's castoff cloaths Nothing can express the vexation of the old duke his pride which had stooped to his avarice in the purchase of his prudent bargain began though too late to have the preeminence he ordered his servant to bear me back to Monmouthstreet and desire the fripperyman to refund the money which he did after deducting a guinea for the use of his magnificence  I was now taken off the coat and condemned to the meltingpot but whilst the executioner is preparing my siery grave I have time to subscribe myself  The public's humble servant A STAR  To the  Printer  of the  Town  and  Country  MAGAZINE  SIR  AS there are few monthly productions so universally read as your agreeable Miscellany I have taken the liberty to beg the insertion of the following short account of my life in which I shall be as brief as possible and which if you think proper to countenance may be a means to warn others of my sex from falling into the same unhappy snares which I now fatally experience have been my ruin  My parents were people of some repute for my father enjoyed a place under the government of upwards of two hundred pounds a year besides a small estate in the country which brought him in about a hundred and fifty pounds a year more As I was their only daughter they naturally took the best care of my learning that their income would permit and I was sent early to a boarding school where I received the rudiments of a polite  education and made as great progress in French music c as could reasonably be expected  I was in my thirteenth year when my father died of a fever and as he had been no great oeconomist and the estate which he enjoyed was to leave our family at his death my poor mother and I were left without the least resource Grief for the loss of a tender and affectionate husband soon put an end to my mother's distress and I was now the only one left to suffer for the faults of my poor father's imprudence It happened I had a near relation who was married to a gentleman of fortune who pitying my situation took me home with her to be a companion By the chearfulness of my disposition and my universal assiduities to please I ingratiated myself so much in the favour of my cousin and Mr M and received for it such convincing proofs of their friendship and desire to make me happy that I soon forgot the loss I had so lately sustained Mr and Mrs M were extremely goodnatured and affable and I enjoyed every felicity I could wish for in my dependent state Unluckily for me Mrs M was threatened with a consumption just as I had attained my fifteenth year which daily increasing  in about six months terminated a life the loss of which I have now the utmost reason to lament but not before she had recommended me to the care of Mr M in such terms that none but a wretch abandoned to all manner of villainy could have ever forgot  I felt every emotion of grief which a heart truly susceptible of gratitude could experience at such a shock but my concern was soon alleviated by the assurances I received from my surviving benefactor of a continuance of that protection and esteem I had hitherto met with By his genorosity I was rendered sole mistress of his house and had every indulgence granted which I could expect As he had no children he took me frequently with him for an airing in the chariot and though I observed his fondness for me daily increase I did not suffer the least suspicion to enter my breast Being of an age in which young women are initiated in company and as I was to move in a more genteel sphere than formerly I was no longer to be supported in my present character but at a considerable expence so that he spared no cost to make me appear suitable to that rank in which he placed me  By this stratagem which I did not at first understand he filled me with additional tenderness and gratitude compelled me to repose on him as my only support and by my sense of his favour and the desire of retaining it disposed me to unlimited complaisances At last the wretch took advantage of the familiarity which he enjoyed as my relation and the submission which he exacted as my benefactor to attempt the ruin of an orphan whom his indulgence had melted and his authority had subdued Shocked at the baseness of his designs I summoned all the courage which a weak woman could employ and resented his behaviour with a becoming indignation But instead of recoiling at the deed he upbraided me with ingratitude and mingled his artifices with menaces of total desertion if I should continue to resist  I was now completely depressed and though I had seen mankind enough to know the necessity of outward chearfulness I often withdrew to my chamber to vent my grief and examine by what means I might escape perpetual mortification The loss of my indulgent parents and kind cousin were  now severely felt and I only reflected that had I been taught a more useful kind of learning than a boardingschool produces I might still live secure under the consciousness of an unblemished reputation Unaccustomed and unexperienced to earn my bread in a menial capacity I had no hopes lest but such as might proceed from his future honour and genorosity I soon found myself cruelly deceived no art or cunning was left untried to accomplish his purpose the most subtle protestations of protection and maintenance were made use of and a solemn promise of marriage to silence all my fears  Oh Woman woman thy name is frailty  Young and credulous I swallowed the glittering bait and fell an easy victim to the unruly passion of an ungrateful wretch  But alas When he found the consequences attendant on our crime which I tremble to relate he not only refused to fulfil his promise of marriage but also abandoned me to all the pangs of recollection and the frowns of a merciless world  Yet villain as he was he did not turn me out of doors till he had given me money to support me in those moments of perturbation which his passion had forced me to suffer and an untimely birth at length relieved me from the anxieties of a mother though it left me under the severe pressures of infamy and the painful prospect of approaching poverty  Friends and acquaintances have now forsaken me and I am reduced to the lot of those unhappy beings from whom many who melt at the sight of all other misery think it meritorious to withhold relief whom the rigour of virtuous indignation dooms to suffer without complaint and perish without regard and whom I myself have formerly insulted in the pride of reputation and security of innocence  Let others who read my story be warned by my example and however specious the pretence avoid the consequences Let them consider that however secure they may think themselves they will have need of all their fortitude when put to the test Whatever they may think of me  let them judge as favourably as possible and as it is out of their power to assist let them at least pity a wretch destined to suffer for the faults of an ungrateful monster  I am Sir Your humble servant MARIA FRIENDLESS  June  To the  Printer  of the  Town  and  Country  MAGAZINE  SIR  PERMIT me through the channel of your Magazine to lay before the public scenes of distress of no common kind Though it can afford me no pleasure to recite the many sufferings of a wretched victim to misfortune yet by my errors others may be convinced that the way of virtue only is the way to felicity Born to an elevated rank in life I was instructed rather to value myself on the blind acquisitions of fortune and the tinsel of external accomplishments than on the more solid and commendable qualifications of the mind My years of infancy were marked by an infant pride and the mercenary disposition of menial servants did not fail to make the evil increase with my growth  When I just entered my sixteenth year I was initated into all the oeconomy of high life Should the rustic or mercantile reader find fault with the expression  oeconomy  when applicable to high life  his ignorance is seen in the censure Dames of spirit have their mean savings and a titled lady is as anxiously avaricious in her way as any plodding citizen whose business and pleasure unite in gain Most of the estates of our nobility are heavily mortgaged or lie useless to the owner till the rent clears the incumbrances this is all that can be urged in defence of a lady of quality's sharping upon her servant and slripping her fille de chambre of all her ready cash to answer some urgent demand upon her honour which she protests by that sacred honour shall be returned with interest in a few days But alas Among quality things equally as sacred as honour are abused and trifled with If there is any real spirit in high life any generous indifference as to the affairs of this world which should constitute the sole merit of  noblesse  it is oftener found in a citizen's wife However the court may exclaim against the city there is less mercenary meanness in the dames of LudgateHill than in a whole masquerade of right honourable dishonourables  But to return to my own story Happy in the notion of the world by being born to a title and a large fortune it is not to be doubted that the  coxcombs of the court were busy to ingratiate themselves in my favour by genteely letting me know they thought themselves very pretty fellows some indeed went so far as to assure me by the  lard  and all that that I was consumedly handsome still keeping a distant view to the dear subject self and never lending a compliment unless it might be returned to the maker These shadows of men were my continual torment being my settled perhaps prejudiced aversion  Another class of lovers deserved rather my friendship or my pity than my love these were men of sense who by the malice of their fortune or their stars if you are an astrologer had never risen in life to what their ambitious ideas aspired to  As the customs of the world are by the courtesy of it allowed to be just these men imagined every girl of conspicuous accomplishments whose unexperienced heart they could deceive into love their lawful prize Dangerous is that lover who has more sense than virtue his sense when perverted is the greatest evil he can possess Fools are mere cyphers they are like the air when the arrow flies no traces remain to tell its way they  are like the sea where every single impression is lost in multitudes of impressions Though I easily defended myself against the egotisms and addresses of the coxcomb I found it no easy task to ward off the assaults of the man of sense his batteries are levelled at the heart and where he has mutual youth to plead in his favour seldom fails of carrying the day In the early bloom of life we are not ourselves and I confess had not pride been a more certain guard than virtue my fortune would have fallen into the hands of the creditors of an unfortunate but amorous author However this was an error of youth and the passion fled with my experience and the absence of the bard But my God Why did it fly To make room for one which should torment me for years Better had it been for me to live poor by the villany of another than to be rich great and miserable by my own villany But just heavens I deserve it all  I was in my nineteenth year when the personal accomplishments of a young gentleman of inferior rank and fortune to mine a Mr Knowles first engaged my notice I cannot say I conceived a passion instantaneously for him I was never so  romantic I admired his manly figure his easy air and affable behaviour In short I wished to know him which was going as far as a woman of prudence could go upon first sight I was then universally allowed to be a beauty and was unhappy enough to engage his attention If his person pleased his conversation charmed me I was now madly in love A solid judgment without the least cynical cast a florid easy manner of speech without the least affectation and a fluent tongue without any impertinence all inspired to make me so From the minute of our conversation we began an acquaintance an illfated one for me Mr Knowles had never spoke of his passion though his fine eyes expressed unutterable things we were often together and I did not think it an unhappy circumstance that no declaration had been made for that chilling coldness which by the custom of the world necessarily succeeds a declaration till the matrimonial act is determined must to mutual lovers be a ceremonious torment In the ensuing spring Mr Knowles being in the country as I was one morning playing on my harpsichord my father came hastily into the room  "My dear girl"  said he throwing his arm round my waist  "I am overjoyed partake of my transports and ease one part of them"  I replied  "Whatever gives my father joy must consequently be welcome to me"  "It is in your power"  answered he  "in your power alone to insure this happiness to me The earl of has seen you he likes he loves you he has this day offered proposals to me and will settle more than your own fortune on you"  I was thunderstruck at this intelligence I could hear no more I fainted My father was frighted he called for help and soon recovered me Seeing me revive he changed his tender solicitude to rage called me an ungrateful vile disobedient wretch in having engaged my affections to another which he was sure was the case without his consent told me I should marry his lordship in three days time or turn out of his doors with nothing but what I could demand Saying this he flung out of the room and left me to consult with Janet my waiting woman who was privy to my prepossession in favour of Mr  Knowles  "Oh Janet"  I exclaimed  "was ever poor creature so suddenly plunged into the depth of misery"  "Why to be sure madam"  returned she  "the matter is a little sudden but as to misery I have heard your honourable father say that happiness and misery were both in our own hands Suppose madam this affair had not hapened would you ever have had Mr Knowles"  "No"  replied I warmly  "No I would never have stooped below my birth"  "Why then dear madam if he is out of the question who could you have better than an earl It is true he is old but then you will have a man of quality and have all your own fortune settled on you For my part I can see no reason to hesitate"  Weak as these reasons may appear it was such cogency of argument that urged me to consent to be countess of Doubting the stability of the resolution I hastened to put it into execution and in one fatal minute did what ages of repentance could not undo My lord was affable and kind my father transported out of himself and I was neither miserable nor happy in a kind of negative existence which for want of a better name we call the vapours a latitudinary word which meaning every thing means nothing  Mr Knowles heard of our marriage he flew on the wings of love As I was sitting alone in my parlour amusing myself with fruitless repentance he burst in upon me and giving me an inexpressible look exclaimed  "Oh my Fanny"  That short sentence did more than the bitterest reproach could have done it threw me into agonies not to be described At last I gathered strength enough to speak  "Sir since the laws of the world have have bound me to another to whom my kind regards are due they cannot now be yours"  This I murmured in articulations scarce to be understood I knew not what I said He started from his chair and eagerly seizing my hand exclaimed  "And was there ever a possibility they could be mine"  This reply embarrassed me greatly I was all confusion and hurry when my lord entered  Nothing can paint the distraction of his features lunacy itself could not be more enraged he fiercely commanded Mr Knowles to walk out of the house without permitting him to speak and returned to me with the countenance of a fury  "Madam"  said he  "could you carry on your vile intrigues no where but in my house But I  will take care for the future you shall have no intrigues elsewhere"  Saying this he left me and never afterwards suffered me to stir out but with an old woman who served me in the office of a duenna  Vexed at this barbarous treatment I resented it like a woman of quality and spirit I insisted on the dismission of my spy and being left to my own liberty This his lordship flatly refused Madening with rage I made an immediate assignation with Mr Knowles exerted my authority sent back my guard and flew in my own coach to the place of appointment  When a woman has taken one false step 'tis too late to think of receding she is necessitated to go on Jealousy is certainly the effect of love yet it is a very troublesome effect and only tends to make the possessor hated by the object he loves  My husband's behaviour grew intolerable and I was determined to leave him This I did soon after with Mr Knowles and we retired to a neighbouring kingdom Happy in not being disturbed we thought his lordship sat easy under his  loss when the first intelligence we had of him brought his will Distracted at the fatal consequence of my resentment I flew to the house once his now mine his generosity having left me all laying the blame on the disparity of our ages my prepossession and his jealousy Here had I the unhappiness to find my father dying stabbed to the heart with the news of my flight O my God what an everlasting hell of reflection must attend the guilty  FRANCES  MEMOIRS OF A SADDOG  To the Editor of the  Town  and  Country  MAGAZINE  SIR  THE man who sits down to write his own history has no very agreeable task to execute The chevalier Taylor is the only egotist since Julius Caesar who has made tolerable work in drawing the picture of himself Julius had but two colours to paint with truth and classic elegance here the chevalier had the advantage for he was too great to be confined within the bounds of the first qualification and has  with a thousand materials The sentimental John Buncle should not be forgotten the man who admires the mountains of the north in his description will lose all his admiration in the real prospect  But to proceed to my own affairs I am Mr Editor a Sad Dog a very Sad Dog have run through many sad adventures had many sad escapes from the clutches of baliffs and at the time of writing this sad relation am throned in a broken chair within an inch of a thundercloud  I set out in life with a fortune of five thousand pounds which the old prig my father left me with this memorable piece of advice  "Item I leave to my youngest son Henry five thousand pounds with an old book formerly his grandmother Bridget's called The Way to save Wealth containing a thousand choice receipts in cookery c and I advise that he read two pages of the said book every day before he dines"  Very pretty advice but I had not veneration enough for the parental character to follow it  When the legacy was paid me I bid my brother adieu drank three bottles of claret with Sir Stentor Ranger who had married my sister and drove furiously to the metropolis in my own phaeton and sour Honour was the only book which I ever honoured with a perusal and being pretty well dipped in the theory of gambling I ventured to  engage with some knights of the post which were a little better versed in the practical part and at one sitting lost one fifth of my fortune This was a terrible stroke to me and I began for the first time in my life to reflect but a bottle of champaigne and a night at the hotel drove every troublesome idea out of my head  Miss Fanny Ht who by a natural transition is transmigrated from a whore into a bagniokeeper was then in the bloom of her charms she was never a firstrate beauty but always a very favourite toast among the bucks and pretty fellows of the city  I was one evening strolling the Park when Miss Fanny had experience enough to perceive that she had nailed my attention As I was neither acquainted with her character or situation I was not a little elated with the condescending glances she honoured me with Presuming on my conquest I made her a few compliments 'squired her out of the Park and thought myself blest in being permitted to accompany her to her lodgings I had not enjoyed my têteàtête five minutes before I was astonished at hearing the wellknown  thunder of the voice of Jack Ntt  "'Sblood and 'oons you old harridan she is mine for a month and I would rather lose fifty per cent than lend her for a single night to the dearest friend upon earth"  To this vociferous exclamation the venerable matron replied  "Won't Miss Kitty do for once or Polly or Miss Nancy"  "I'll have no Miss but Fanny by G"  replied Jack bursting into the parlour upon us I was now sufficiently in the secret and not displeased at finding my charmer no vestal Jack who had paid fifty pounds for his month insisted on his right of purchase but Miss Fanny thinking me a better paymaster heroically turned him out of the parlour telling him for his comfort that he should have his month another time Miss Fanny pleased me so well that before I was weary of her I had sunk another thousand when in a fit of reflexion I bid her adieu and left her to Jack and the rest of her monthly keepers  To make a little digression I think this method of hiring for a month preferable to the wholesale bargains for life and of mutual advantage to the keeper and kept if that form will stand good in law for a man will find it all rapture and love  without disgust and in a few months play the the same part over again with no decay of vigour  Jack Ntt is now a principal merchant and rolls about in his coach and four to every public dinner where his appetite and solidity of judgment in the edible way does honour to the city It is notorious that he is a cuckold and by more than one method free of his company but that is no detriment to him in the scale of mercantile merit The extraordinary bustle he has made in a late political affair is very little to his advantage but it must be observed in his defence that the earl of Hlsbh did him the greatest act of friendship mortal man could do him viz invited him to a turtlefeast and revealed to him a secret in the culinary art till then utterly unknown to all the world but his lordship and his cook Some indeed pretended to say that this secret is nothing more than giving venison an additional flavour by basting it with a preparation of French cheese and rancid butter but as I would not presume to give my opinion in a matter of such importance I shall leave Jack to the pleasure of the table and proceed in my relation  On this considerable decay of my fortune I began to consider seriously of my departed father's curious advice and in consequence of this consideration resolved to set up for a fortunehunter and retrieve my affairs in the sober track of matrimony A Miss Ln was the girl I had fixed upon and accordingly dressed at She raised my hopes and gratified my vanity by several significant glances and I was so certain of carrying her off in the end that I chearfully launched out five hundred pounds in dress and equipage which had such an amazing effect that in three weeks time I had three kisses of her hand and in the fourth week she took a trip to Scotland with her father's footman This unexpected stroke created in me an absolute aversion to matrimony and a resolution not to endeavour to better myself by the hymenial knot  Soon after this affair I made an acquaintance with the wife of an alderman I shall conceal his name as his patriotic behaviour has rendered him respectable in the city Mrs was of an amorous complexion her husband had too much of the citizen to be like her turtle venison and popularity were the only objects of his attention  out of the comptinghouse Though he has never repeated three periods with propriety except when assisted by the ingenious device of placing the readymade speech in the crown of his hat yet his mercantile genius has often struck upon very lucky hits He is unrivalled in reckoning the amount of rate per cent and no stockbroker at Jonathan's can whisper a piece of secret intelligence with half his dexterity Between you and I and the post Mr Editor the stopping the circulation of bad halfpence inconsiderable as the coin may appear to some has brought him in no less than seven thousand pounds and increased the trade of him and his partners amazingly  Mrs had penetration enough to find out my good qualities and you will suppose that I was not wanting in acknowledging her partiality We had frequent interviews at the house of a capital miliner in the Strand and the amour for some time went swimmingly on  Mrs was under no apprehensions of my being satiated with enjoyment for generously considering I was but a younger brother I never sacrificed on the altar of the Cyprean goddess  without receiving a bankbill worth my acceptance But alas happiness is of short duration or to speak in the language of the highsounding Ossian  "Behold thou art happy but soon ah soon wilt thou be miserable Thou art as easy and tranquil as the face of the greenmantled puddle but soon ah soon wilt thou be tumbled and tossed by misfortunes like the stream of the watermill Thou art beautiful as the cathederal of Canterbury but soon wilt thou be deformed like Chinese palacepaling So the sun rising in the east gilds the borders of the black mountains and laces with his golden rays the darkbrown heath The hind leaps over the slowery lawn and the reeky bull rolls in the bubbling brook The wild boar makes ready his armour of defence The inhabitants of the rocks dance and all nature joins in the song But see riding on the wings of the wind the black clouds fly The noisy thunders roar the rapid lightnings gleam the rainy torrents pour and the dropping swain flies over the mountain swift as Bickerstaff the son of song when the monster Bumbailiano keeper of the dark and black cave pursued him over the hills of death and the green meadows of dark men"  O Ossian immortal genius what an invocation  could I make now but I shall leave it to the abler pen of Mr Duff and spin out the thread of my own adventures  Mrs having dispatched a billet to me I flew to her in her own house The knight as she thought was fixed to the table of Sir Tunbelly Grains knight citizen and alderman who had invited him to dinner on a delicious turtle a blessing not to be neglected But Oh grief of griefs the knight having forgot his favourite tobaccobox popped in upon us unexpectedly and found us too familiarly engaged Instead of bursting into the rage which might have animated an Italian or Spaniard on the occasion he shook his head and pronouncing coolly  "Very fine all very fine"  he left us and returned to Sir Tunbelly to finish the turtle As by his hasty throwing open the door he had exposed us to the view of two of his servants I was terribly afraid of a prosecution for  crim con  for though it was as fashionable then as it is now I was not very eager to lose the remainder of my fortune fashionably But the knight considering his reputation would receive a severe stroke should the affair be made public contented himself with demanding  two thousand pounds for the injury I had done him As he threatened to prosecute for larger damages unless I complied I was obliged to refund more than Mrs 's bounty had bestowed upon me  The old curmudgeon had heartily provoked me and I resolved though at the expence of every shilling I had to be revenged on him For this purpose I published the whole affair and the devil assisting my invention I struck upon another expedient to gratify my vengeance  The knight's eldest daughter Sabina whom he had by a former wife was a fine sprightly girl and wanted nothing but the  bon ton  to render her perfectly accomplished about eighteen a remarkable fine complexion and expressive blue eyes She was at the time of the unlucky discovery with a relation in Essex as I had formerly paid a few compliments to her beauty which I had reason to say without vanity were not ill received I instantly dispatched an epistle to her the most tender my imagination could dictate It wrought the effect I designed and she returned an answer After a long farce of lying and intriguing on my  part and credulity on hers I accomplished the grand endyou will guess what I mean  We lived in love and rapture about a month when her father bid her prepare to marry Mr Lutestring the mercer by the next week She flew to the usual place of assignation bathed in tears with a face expressive of the most violent grief  I was now almost persuaded to love her in earnest but I was a Sad Dog to suffer revenge and when I seriously reflect a revenge which had no foundation in reason to get the better of every nobler passion  "O my dear Harry"  exclaimed the beautiful unfortunate  "let us fly immediately to Scotland otherwise my father inhuman man will oblige me to marry Bob Lutestring next week"  "Bob Lutestring my dear"  replied I indifferently  "is a substantial man and I would not have you disoblige your father on my account"  "And is this your advice"  returned the heroine assuming a dignified air  "be assured Sir I shall follow it"  Saying this she slung from me her ideas I suppose a little different from those she brought with her  But I had not yet accomplished my revenge Steeled in impudence as I am I blush to write the rest but it shall be out I informed Mr Lutestring of my intimacy with his future spouse and advised him not to unite himself to a woman of such principles I made certain of receiving a challenge and a string of curses for my information but alas I knew not the city  "Sir"  replied the mercer  "I thank you for your intelligence this day received but your advice is not worth a yard of tape you say Sabina has been faulty allow it but will her father give me any thing the less for her fortune on that account on the contrary were not my notions of honour very refined I might make it a means of raising my price"  I slunk away astonished at this reply reflecting how various are the species and refinements of honour  I was now just on the brink of poverty I had made a considerable breach in my last five hundred and began to shudder at the contempt with which the decay of my fortune threatened me Relying on his former professions of friendship I posted down to Sir Stentor Ranger in hopes he would have assisted me I found the knight very busy with Sir Charles Banbury in tracing the honourable pedigree of an Arabian barb  "Hey Hal"  exclaimed the knight with a voice which would have drowned the full chorus of a foxchace  "what the devil brought thee here I thought thou wert grown a gentleman and had forgotten us all"  He received me with as much kindness and civility as his rustic breeding would permit and invited me to his antiquated hall  After a noble dinner of venison when Sir Charles had retired on cracking the nineteenth bottle I ventured to open the business Nothing can express the surprise which distended the knight's ample countenance I made no very agreeable comments on his astonishment but thank Heaven those comments were as groundless as the Rev Mr Bentinck's on the Bible  "Zounds"  thundered the knight  "five thousand pounds gone already you have been a Sad Dog Hal that I'll say for thee But howsundever as thou beest my nown flesh and blood d'ye see I'll do something for thee Let me see let me see dost understand horseflesh"  I answered  "that I was not very deep in the mystery but I hoped with a little of his instructions to be serviceable to him"  "Adad thou art in the right Hal nobody knows these things better than me There's my lord Grosvenor's filly Long Dick he would have it that he was got by his own horse Thunder when I by the mere make of his pastern found 'um out to be got by Sir George Blunt's white horse Duke Dost know any thing of dogs Canst train a pointer or a hawk or such like things"  "This"  I replied  "I could with safety undertake"  "Well then zay no more no more words to the matter I'll do for thee thou shalt have one hundred and fifty pounds a year and so ge'es  thy hand Hal A bargain's a bargain I scorn to flinch from my word thou shalt ha'it odzookers thou shalt ha'it"  In consequence of this bargain I commenced superintendant of his stables and kennels I discharged my office much to his satisfaction and by dint of application acquiring some knowledge in the mysteries of the turf I began to be of consequence in the racing world Sir Stentor's hall was very ancient and had been in days of yore a family seat of the Mowbrays It had not undergone any considerable reparation since the Reformation when an ancestor of Sir Stentor's having often had quarrels with a neighbouring abbot in the sacrilegious pillage purchased his abbey for less than the onetwentieth of its value and robbing it of all its ornaments and painted glass made the abbey a stable and turned his dogs into the chapel  Sir Stentor had many curious visitors on account of his antient painted glasswindows among the rest was the redoubted baron Otranto who has spent his whole life in conjectures This most ingenious gentleman as a certain advertiser stiles  him is certainly a good judge of paintings and has an original easy manner of writing That his knowledge in antiquity equals his other accomplishments may be disputed As Sir Stentor had ever been politically attached to his family he welcomed the the baron with every demonstration of joy and ordered the bells of the parish church to be rung As a further testimony of his joy he sent for a blind fidler the Barthelemon of the village to entertain the baron with a solo during dinner and after the desert Robin Hood's Ramble was melodiously chaunted by the knight's groom and dairymaid to the excellent music of a twostringed violin and a bagpipe A concert by the first masters in Europe could not have pleased the baron so well he imagined himself carried back to the age of his favourite hero Richard the Third  Should any critic assert that it is impossible such an imagination could enter the  cerebellum  of the baron who confines all his ideas within the narrow limits of propriety for the songs of Robin Hood were not in being till the reign of queen Elizabeth his assertion shall stand uncontradicted by me as I know by woeful experience  that when an author resolves to think himself in the right it is more than human argument can do to convince him he is in the wrong  The baron after dinner asked the knight if he had ever discovered in any place about his house an escutcheon argent on a fesse gules three garbs or between as many shields sable cheveronny of the first  To this learned interrogatory the knight answered with a stare of astonishment and  "Anon Sir what d'ye talk of I don't understand such outlandish lingo not I for my part"  Otranto finding it impossible to enter into a conversation suitable to his hobbyhorse begged leave to visit the kennel desiring the knight to permit the huntsman to go with him lest the dogs might not be over civil to a stranger  "Odzookers"  cried Sir Stentor  "are you afraid of the dogs I'll go with you myself man"  The baron found many things worthy his notice in the ruinated chapel but the knight was so full of the praises of his harriers that the antiquary had not opportunity to form one conjecture After looking round the chapel for some moveable piece of age on which he might employ his speculative talents to the eternal honour of his judgment he pitched upon a stone which had no antiquity at all and transported with his fancied prize placed it upon his head and bore it triumphantly to his chamber desiring the knight to give him no disturbance the next day as he intended to devote it to the service of futurity  This important piece of stone had by the huntsman been sacrilegiously stolen from the neighbouring churchyard and employed with others to stop up a breach in the kennel through which the adventurous Jowler had squeezed his lank carcase  Nothing can escape the clutches of curiosity The letters being ill cut had an appearance of something Gothic and the baron was so far gone in this Quixotism of literature that at the first glance he determined them to be of the third Runic alphabet of Wormius  The original inscription was James Hicks lieth here with Hester his wife  The broken stone is here represented  The baron having turned over Camden Dugdale Leyland and Wever at last determined it to be  Hic jacet corpus Kenelmae Sancto Legero Requicseat  c c What confirmed him in the above reading and made it impossible for him to be mistaken was that a great man of the name of Sancto Legero had been buried in the county about five hundred years ago  Elated with the happy discovery the Baron had an elegant engraving of the curiosity executed and presented it to the society of antiquaries who look upon it as one of the most important discoveries which have been made since the great Dr Trefoil found out that the word  kine  came from the Saxon  co  ice  When this miracle of literature left the village the bells were again rung and the baron was wrapped in Elysium on the success of his visit  I had served Sir Stentor above two years when by a lucky hit Sir Charles Banbury and myself took the whole field in and cleared above twenty thousand pounds eight thousand of which fell to my share  I was now once more established in the world and redeemed from the dependance which had mortified my pride As I was seldom ungrateful I repaid Sir Stentor's kindness by revealing to him the whole  arcana  of the turf which he has improved to so much advantage that he has added five hundred  per annum  to his paternal estate by his successes at Newmarket  In prosperity I never gave ear to the sage whispers of Prudence her cool advice was never felt but in the winter of adversity I was flush and resolved to go over to Paris and glitter in all the splendor of an Englishman This rapid resolution was as rapidly executed and in less than ten days  after my success I found myself at the city of noise and frippery  I had too much spirit to murmur at the expence but I often wished for something more substantial than  soup  or  fricasée  after living at the gigantic table of Sir Stentor and feasting on roast beef and venison I found it difficult to swallow liquids and shadows But every other consideration was soon drowned in that of a young marchioness who never met my eyes without telling them such a tale of love that it was impossible not to understand it  I directed my valet La Fosse to make every possible enquiry after her he brought me intelligence that she was the widow of a marquis and of a very noble family This was sufficient I instantly dispatched a messenger of love to her and 'ere another moon had gilded up her horns married her But I had cause to repent my expedition she was indeed the widow of a marquis but one of the poorest of that title in France his debts were great and his widow instead of discharging them had contracted more her noble family not being able to support her  I was soon rouzed from my dream of happiness and thrown into prison my fortune was insufficient to procure my liberty and there I should have perished had not an old rich farmergeneral taken my wife under his protection paid her debts generously set me free and presented me with a bill of two hundred pounds on condition I returned to England I did not chuse to reject his offer and with that sort of pseudorepentance which generally waits on us when we are grown wise too late took my leave of France and prosperity  Immediately on my return to England I waited on Sir Stentor but the knight knowing my genius in horseflesh was not willing to put me in a condition of rivalling him upon the turf  "Zounds Hal whoy thou spendest every thing no no I duont want a top gamekeeper now Here I'll gi' thee this bill of one hundred pounds and my bay gelding Jockey go and see 'un he is as fine a beast as any I have in hand"  I thought it not prudent to refuse the knight's offer and making the best of a bad bargain accepted  Jockey and the bill and made the best of my way to London  Here after a long deliberation I resolved to turn stockjobber and the first time I visited Jonathan's by propagating a report that Jamaica was taken by the Spaniards increased my small sum to two thousand pounds I was now in raptures and saw once again the visions of good fortune swimming before my sight I still continued improving my principal when an account from Trieste reduced me to seven hundred and in a few days after another account from the same unfortunate place utterly ruined me and I waddled a lame duck out of the alley  What could I now do As to mechanic business I was utterly a stranger to it and my soul disdained the livery of a slave I had distracted myself with reflection till the last bill of ten pounds was mutilated when I thought of setting up for an author  As I did not doubt my invention and had vanity enough for the character I sat down to invoke the muses The first fruits of my pen were  a political essay and a piece of poetry the first I carried to a patriotic bookseller who is in his own opinion of much consequence to the cause of liberty and the poetry was left with another of the same tribe who made bold to make it a means of puffing his Magazine but refused any gratuity Mr Britannicus at first imagining the piece was not to be paid for was lavish of his praises and I might depend upon it it should do honour to his flaming patriotic paper but when he was told that I expected some recompence he assumed an air of criticism and begged my pardon he did not know that circumstance and really he did not think it good language or sound reasoning  I was not discouraged by the objections and criticisms of the bookselling tribe and as I know the art of Curlism pretty well I make a tolerable hand of it But Mr Printer the late prosecution against the booksellers having frightened them all out of their patriotism I am necessitated either to write for the entertainment of the public or in defence of the ministry As I have some little remains of conscience the latter is not very agreeable Political writing of either  side of the question is of little service to the entertainment or instruction of the reader Abuse and scurrillity are generally the chief figures in the language of party I am not of the opinion of those authors who deem every man in place a rascal and every man out of place a patriot  Permit this then to appear in your universally admired Magazine it may give some entertainment to your reader and a dinner to  Your humble servant HARRY WILDFIRE  To the  Printer  of the  Town  and  Country  MAGAZINE  SIR  LEST your Hunter of Oddities should meet with me and cook up my singularity as a dish of diversion for the town I trouble you with a description of myself Have you ever seen a portait by Holbein or the figure of an old fellow in ancient tapestry I am a laughable counterpart to either of these curiosities I am heir to no inconsiderable estate which has but one incumbrance on it a plaguy longlived surly dog of a father  If I am not mistaken the Romancatholics make longevity one of the peculiar gifts of heaven I confess I am so irreligious as to wish heaven had been less sparing of its gifts to my honoured papa You will say I am an ungracious child perhaps but when you have got to the end of my epistle you will excuse me If absurdities and follies are the general attendants of age I cannot see with what justice greyhairs command veneration  My father has as well furnished a wardrobe as any knight in the shire but not an individual garment in it which has been made since the Revolution  My father dresses in the uniform of a courtier in the reign of James I his hat is like a strawberrybasket with the handle thrust under his chin this piece of ornament belonged to Robert Carey who as he was a great man in his time and nearly related to our family must not be out of remembrance He wears also an enormous ruff once the property of Sir Venison Goosepye lordmayor of London who though of a younger branch of the family established it on a more respectable footing than before by doubling its rentroll Gratitude obliges my sire to wear this ruff though as full of holes as a lawyer's conscience A flashed doublet with slit sleeves and a long cloak envelopes his trunk and a monstrous pair of trunkhose square shoes and large shoeroses conclude his bundle of ridiculous habiliments Could I persuade him to be contented with making himself laughed at I should be happy in entertaining my friends with the oddity of his appearance but when I consider that mine is equally  as laughable I sicken at the sight of his antiquated garb I am almost ashamed to describe myself but in hopes that he must soon set out on his journey to the other world I make a virtue of necessity and comply He absolutely threatens to disinherit me if I grumble at dressing for the memory of the departed and an estate of sixthousand  per annum  is not to be lost for the sake of a fulltrimmed suit and a gold button My hair is dressed in a very peculiar and risible manner it is cut close on the middle of the head and twisted like a horse's mane on each side this my papa avers was the most polite fashion in the reign of queen Elizabeth as appears by the portrait of his great uncle Sir Henry Dainty This Sir Henry was the greatest beau of his time and is thought by a learned antiquary to be the identical person for whom Shakespeare drew the character of Ostrick in Hamlet My hat is not quite so comical as my sire's it inclines more to the shape of a closestoolpan pardon the simile you will find it in another author it is too delicate to be my own This ornament of the head once graced the  caput  of the profound Dr Technicus who had an universal nostrum which enabled him to ride in his chair and what do you think this nostrum was  Nothing but a cataplasm of masticated bread and butter My ruff is perfectly yellow but as it belonged to the reverend Dr Drouzy my father makes it a point of conscience to oblige me to wear it I have a large jutting coat and wide breeches the very tip of the mode in the days of Henry VII mottled stocking red and green and shoes with monstrous pikes complete my ornamentals  This Mr Printer is a perfect representation of my externals Do be so obliging as to give the old fellow a hint in your Magazine that he acts very ridiculously He has already felt the bad effects of his antiquated wardrobe My sister was as laughable as myself she wore a hood of unconscionable thick velvet which projected on each side of her face like a horse's blinds her ruff was enormous and betwixt that and her headgear there was nothing but the tip of her nose to be seen her stays reached down to her knees her stockings were yellow and her shoes squaretoed All these ornaments had in the days of their prosperity glittered on Alice Sevenoke a maid of honour to queen Mary who was famous for making custards and giving eelpies an excellent relish My sister Biddy's gown was as heavy as  a modern novel upon a moderate computation it had above three pounds of silver in its embroidery the colours indeed were faded but that defect was made up in the lenghth of the train which afforded the cat a five minutes play while Miss Biddy was turning the corner  A female must necessarily be worse qualified to bear this purgatory than a man and she having fifteen thousand pounds which an old aunt had left her to be paid at her marriage whipped off to Scotland at the age of sixteen with a young fellow in the army Would I could make my escape too from the tyranny of this taylor of antiquity I am sensible no character at Cornelys's could make so ridiculous an appearance as I do  Oh dear Mr Ham if you have any bowels of compassion address a line or two to the old prig shew him how barbarous it is to deprive a young fellow of all the pleasures of life to indulge an unaccountable whim push the matter home to him and if you succeed you shall ever have the prayers of  Your humble servant TONY SELWOOD  To the  Printer  of the  Town  and  Country  MAGAZINE  NUMBER I  SIR  I Think Addison says in defining a complete fine gentleman that even dress should be attended to and indeed it has so great an influence in most situations of this life that a person who is entirely negligent of it will find himself either overlooked or despised in the usual intercourse of society  There are indeed some singular characters who pique themselves upon an utter contempt for dress but to the shame of men of letters be it said that these are generally pedants or such as value themselves upon an affected absence from the trivial pursuits of this world  Dick Flighty is a man of a very different cast from these dress he considers as the ultimate end of existence and he would be miserable for a  year if lord M or captain G was to have a new fashoned  cut  from Paris before him He was the first who introduced the Tambour waistcoat he rode post from that metropolis with six horses to be here in time This he considered as a very capital stroke in establishing his fashionable character and which he looked upon as indispensable when Sir James G appeared in a silver silk flowered embroidery before he had recieved intelligence of the invention His disgrace upon this occasion was inexpressible and had he not retrieved himself in the violet birds eye velvet on the ensuing birthday the consequence might have been fatal  Dick is possessed of about four thousand a year which he lays out in his opinion to the best advantage He neither games nor drinks which considering the licentiousness of the age is something extraordinary but then he keeps as elegant an equipage as any man in town which he constantly uses besides this he has a fine pack of hounds though he never hunts four racehorses though he never sports and keeps three mistresses whom he never visits  To be ingenuous Dick may be fairly classed as the sovereign of  petit maitres  the prince of fops and the representativegeneral of coxcombs nevertheless Dick is an arrant sloven Whilst he is driving from one end of the town to the other in search of the most celebrated embroiderer to give him directions concerning a new invented sprig his  chapeau de bras  which he wears on his head would be a disgrace to a hair dresser and the back of his coat is more greasy than a butcher's but then this is the  ton  Dick holds it as an invariable maxim that a clean coat and a good hat in an undress would be a disgrace to a gentleman and bring him upon a level with a  bourgeois  I am Sir Yours A HUNTER OF ODDITIES  St James's CoffeeHouse  May  NUMBER II  SIR  FINDING you gave place to my Odd Man in your last I have sent you another to hand up in the group and as I shall let you have one every month we shall by the end of the year complete our collection  Dick Slender is now about his fortyfifth year six feet high without any incumbrance of flesh He is one of those people who saunter about town and call themselves gentlemen because they have nothing to do and are incapable of doing any thing  Dick upon the death of his father became possessed of three thousand pounds in the funds he was destined to the bar and had been brought up in the Temple but finding in himself very little disposition for the Statutes at Large or Coke upon Littleton he shut up his folios and resolved to be the man of pleasure  He soon discovered however that the interest of his money at three per cent would not support him in the line of life he had chalked out and therefore sunk the capital in the purchase of an annuity and caring for neither man woman or child eats drinks and dresses up to one hundred and eighty pounds per annum  Dick is always the first night at a new play in the pit and though he never read Aristotle or understands a syllable of Horace he is one of the greatest critics of the age He has learnt a few setphrases at the Bedford these he utters promiscuously upon all such occasions and he blends them in so curious a manner that they will do for any performance of every degree of merit He nevertheless has frequently a crowd about him at the coffeehouse and his decisions indecisive as they be are considered as the opinion of the town  His success in gallantry is not less conspicuous than his judgment in criticism if a number of letters constantly addressed to him in a female hand often sealed with a coronet can authenticate his intrigues or prove that half the women of  fashion in England are enamoured with him But unfortunately he lately quarrelled with his washerwoman upon the loss of some silk stockings and she has revealed a secret that has banished him from George's for these three weeks She was the amanuensis the corresponding ladies and the deliverer of all these letters to the parties who brought them to this coffeehouse and she is resolved to keep the seal with the coronet for her trouble This she has revealed to several of her customers in the Temple at the same time declaring that notwithstanding the many intrigues she had carried on with Dick Slender and though she had often been alone with him in private he had never once offered a rude thing to her yet Jenny is but two and twenty has a very wanton eye and a good complexion  To illustrate Dick's character still farther he is a politician he has read all Junius's letters and can make out every dash he is a member of the Bill of Rights harangues at the Smyrna upon the Middlesex election and proposes questions at the Robinhood upon the legality of incapacitation It is true that all his political reading has been confined to the Public and the Gazetteer but no  man understands the real  nature of our constitution the essence of our rights and liberties the limits of the prerogative the extent of parliamentary privileges the nature of our foreign connections or the balance of power  better or more profoundly than DICK SLENDERby  intuition  A HUNTER OF ODDITIES  NUMBER III  SIR  THIS metropolis abounds with so many oddities that I am sometimes at a loss to hit upon one for the month I have now in my collection about three dozen that will do either for winter or summer their peculiarities are of such a nature and they are such complete originals they never can be unseasonably hung up to public view But a truce with preface or else perhaps you will think me worthy a place in my own collection  Eolus is as variable in his temper as the thirtytwo points of the compass but it must be acknowledged that a coach has to him all the magnetic qualities of the loadstone especially when the wind is in his chops But why confine his character in so small a compass Eolus is every body and every thing at times he eats like Quin drinks with Rigby intrigues with a Cumbd and fights with every man that never existed He is a buckram hero and if I might be allowed a taylor's  pun you may twist him to what you please It is time however to bring forth our hero and let him speak for himself  Enter  Eolus  Eolus  Here cookat four preciselylet the venison be done to a turn and as to the turbot let it weigh exactly three pounds not an ounce more or less  Cook  Yes Sir you may depend upon your directions being punctually followedNobody I think hits your honour's taste so well as meI study it day and night  Eolus  Yes Jack I must acknowledge you do make me eat a pound more since you came to the house than ever I did before I shall just take a turn in a hack round the new buildings Grosvenorsquare and Marybone by way of a whet and be here precisely at four  So short a dialogue dear Ham cannot certainly disgust your readers but perhaps they may be curious to know how many he has to dine with  him Just as many as a certain rl lover found when he awoke and met with nobody but himself  Eolus seems to have followed Quin's rule which I shall exemplify Said lady Tshd I mean the modest lady Tshd to Quin  "I wonder Mr Quin that you do not marry take a house and keep an equipage"  "Why lookye my lady I like the sweets of matrimony without the bittersI always carry my wife my coach and my cook in my pocket and when they displease me jolt me into a passion or spoil my appetite I turn them off"  Quin was so pregnant of good things that the very mention of him engenders a number but I shall take up your reader's time with the relation of only one more which he said to the same lady upon a somewhat similar occasion  "Pray Mr Quin"  said she  "did you ever make love"  "No my lady"  replied Sir John Bruce  "I always buy it ready made"  So much for Quin now once more for Eolus he is about five seet nothing as round as a hogshead owing to his eating immoderately rides in a hack all the morning to create an appetite rides  in the same vehicle all the afternoon to promote digestion He has seven hundred a year of which he does not save a farthing which he disposes of chiefly to hackneycoachmen and vintners The ladies however ingross some part of his purse as well as his person but he is an oeconomist in love at least with regard to property which he transfers to them very sparingly  If after this any one should think Eolus the mere puff of imagination he may be seen alive every day at four not a hundred yards from Warwickcourt Holborn  A HUNTER OF ODDITIES  NUMBER IV  SIR  LOUNGING the other day at Slaughter's coffeehouse I made acquaintance with a person who has turned out a proper candidate to be enrolled in your list of oddities  He had been reading the Gazetteer for about twenty minutes in the course of which he had taken as many pinches of snuff when he started all at once and giving a fling to the paper overturned a dish of scalding coffee upon a gentleman's white silk stockings crying  "Zounds there he is againhow he stinks"  then rising up without paying any attention to the mischief he had done or making the least apology to the gentleman whose legs he had scalded he walked three or four times up and down the room shaking his arm and fingers crying out  "Keep off keep off"  I did not know what to conclude from his behaviour but as I was the nearest to him during his exclamation and this perambulation I thought it  necessary to ask him whether he proposed insulting meto which he made no reply but muttered  "The devil opened my curtains last night and he has been after me all day"  Then shaking his hand more violently than ever  "there you are off at last"  After this curious soliloquy he began to grow a little calm seated himself upon another of the benches and ordered a pint of milk He then pulled out of his pocket several old pamphlets and read them very attentively but not without ejaculating now and thee  "Off you villain off"  and shaking his hand and arm very violently  I enquired at the bar who this extraordinary person was and whether he was out of his mind when I was informed that he was Mr Hawy brother to the commissioner of that name that he had frequented the house several years and that he was a very inoffensive goodnatured man  Having received this intelligence I resolved to have a little conversation with him when I found him very rational upon every subject except the devil but the slightest hint about that infernal being made him shake his hand and arm and cry out  "Offoff"  It would be doing this gentleman a great piece of service if any of your ingenious correspondents could hit upon some probable scheme of exorcising this same devil out of poor Hawy who would then in every respect be an agreeable and worthy member of society  A HUNTER OF ODDITIES  Slaughter's Coffeehouse  June  To the  Printer  of the  Town  and  Country  MAGAZINE  SIR  THOUGH I have much reason to think myself qualified for society I am to my great mortification confided in a boardingschool however I am not debarred the pleasure of reading I know all the real names of your  téte à tétes  and am very well skilled in decyphering an asterism or dash I have perused every novel published by Lowndes or Noble and could upon occasion compile a secret history as pathetic and moving as any other female author There is no modern play which I have not read from the bright sallies of Foote to the dull dialogue of Cumberland You see I am a judge of theatrical merit my knowledge of the drama is hereditary for my cousin Ben who understands heraldry can prove himself and consequently me to be descended from Ben Jonson's grandmother's sister So much for internal merit The young foxhunters in the neighbourhood swear I am a woundy pretty maid The politer sort protest before gad I am  an angel and Madame Gouvernante tells me I am very fair very elegant and every way accomplished You will excuse this description of myself as it is a true though trite observation that few readers regard any history 'till they are minutely acquainted with the author my intention in writing was to ask your advice Now you must know Mr Ham that I have ten thousand pounds at my own disposal a qualification which may in your opinion exceed all the others I value myself upon My father who is a plodding sort of a man and upon Bristol exchange or rather in the street has the character of a rich merchant who knows how to live in the world designs to marry me to Bob Barter the hopeful son of his good friend Hezekiah Barter Bob is in the polite language of Bristol a devil of a buck You may see him in the morning sitting under a shed on the key registering the weight of sugars and in the evening shining at a ball He overturns a basket of oysters or beats a dog with a better grace than any youthful notary of Bacchus in that elegant city the cream of politeness As Madame Gouvernante knows my father's intentions she very readily permits his intrusions and takes every opportunity to leave  us together The wretch has never read further than the Gazette or tables of interest so that it is impossible to receive a compliment worth accepting from him He seems to look upon me as already married and treats me with a suitable indifference Upon the exit of the Gouvernante he claps on his hat takes a turn round the room very politely exposes his backside to the fire and remarks it is very cold or something of equal importance I never regard the wretch but if I am reading consider myself as alone and read on Pray Mr Hamilton is such a contemptible being to be treated with more respect Having told you I do not like this uncivilized Bristolian you may imagine a  tendresse  for some other has made his faults more conspicuous You will not be far from the truth A young author who has read more than Magliabechi and wrote more loveletters than Ovid is continually invoking the nine to describe me but he never pays a compliment to my person without a concomitant one to my understanding Though I have ten thousand pounds he never mentions marriage and when it is forced into his discourse rails at it most religiously but he intrigues like a Jesuit to be made happy with a  téte à téte  conversation  or a walk in the wood but thank my stars I have always courageously denied He has sentiment in his common conversation and is reported to have ruined three young ladies of fortune Pray Mr Hamilton what am I to do in this case Nothing can be more disagreeable than this boardingschool If I am obliged to marry that insignificant wretch Bob Barter will the forced ceremony oblige me to hate my literary lover Your advice will oblige  Yours c ASTREA BROKAGE  Bristol  Jan  A SONG ADDRESSED TO MISS CAM OF BRISTOL  AS Spring now approaches with all his gay train  And scatters his beauties around the green plain  Come then my dear charmer all scruples remove  Accept of my passion allow me to love  Without the soft transports which love must inspire  Without the sweet torment of fear and desire  Our thoughts and ideas are never refin'd  And nothing but winter can reign in the mind  But love is the blossom the spring of the soul  The frosts of our judgments may check not controul  In spite of each hindrance the spring will return  And nature with transports refining will burn  This passion celestial by Heav'n was design'd  The only fix'd means of improving the mind  When it beams on the senses they quickly display  How great and prolific how pleasing the ray  Then come my dear charmer since love is a flame  Which polishes nature and angels your frame  Permit the soft passion to rise in your breast  I leave your good nature to grant me the rest  Shall the beautiful flow'rets all blossom around  Shall Flora's gay mantle enamel the ground  Shall the red blushing blossom be seen on the tree  Without the least pleasure or rapture for me  And yet if my charmer should frown when I sing  Ah what are the beauties the glories of spring  The flowers will be faded all happiness fly  And clouds veil the azure of every bright sky  C  London  May  To the Printer of the  Town  and  Country  MAGAZINE  SIR  I Was some time since in company with a party who piqued themselves upon being men of wit and genius one of them however was nothing more than a pretender who after many ineffectual attempts at length set the table on a roar by a most execrable pun he joined in the laugh and fancied he had now been very successful when a gentleman turning to lord Chd asked his lordship what was his opinion of punning in general To which his lordship replied  "I conceive punning has a doublefold advantage in company for a very good pun makes one laugh and a very bad one makes one laugh still more as was the case just now but"  said he  "an indifferent pun is the most indifferent of all indifferent things having neither salt enough to make one smile or stupidity enough to excite the risible muscles at the author and may therefore be stiled the dregs of wit the sediment of humour and the  caput mortuum  of common sense"  I am Sir your constant reader And humble servant T B  Berkleysquare  June  THE UNFORTUNATE FATHERS  MR Sladon a merchant of Bristol by industry and diligent application to business acquired a considerable fortune As he was an enemy to noise and pomp he neither set up his carriage nor endeavoured to make a splended appearance his only care centered in Maria his beautiful daughter he spared no costs to complete her education her genius requited his labour no instructions were lost on her and she excelled in every qualification which dignify her sex At the age of seventeen she was universally allowed to be a beauty The reader will excuse the writer from giving a description of her person let him cull from the volumes of poets and painters all his imagination counts beautiful and throw into it an inexpressible softness and he has Maria  Mr Hinckley whose father was closely connected in trade with Mr Sladon struck with the  uncommon lustre of Maria's person and mind intreated his father to permit him to pay his addresses to her  "George"  said the priest of Mammon  "I commend your choice Miss Sladon is a very good oeconomist and will have little less than a plumb to her fortune go and prosper"  Young Hinckley assured his father he had not the least mercenary view  "Away"  replied the old man  "when you have been as often upon 'Change as me you'll know better"  Young Hinckley had no cause to complain of his reception Maria had never viewed him with eyes of indifference Mr Sladon rejoiced at the proposed alliance all was unity and love and before the expiration of two months George acquainted his father that he intended to request Mr Sladon to fix the day but was thunderstruck with his command that he should not go such lengths till he had further orders from him  Mr Sladon who was himself above deceit never suspected it in another his generous frankness laid him open to the vile arts of old Hinckley after being connected together the space of a year he broke and ruined him  Maria had by this time conceived the most tender passion for young Hinckley it was allowable as she had always considered him as her future husband No words can describe Hinckley's excess of love Imagine what an effect this stroke must have upon both Nothing but imagination can paint it  Mr Sladon was only affected for his daughter his noble soul rose superior to this revolution he triumphed in poverty over the wealthy wretch who caused his misfortunes Old Hinckley whose fortune was increased not dimished by this infamous action perceived with chagrin his son's madness for Maria he endeavoured to divert his attention to objects more rich and therefore in his opinion more deserving but he laboured in vain nothing could abate his love Mr Sladon saw his passion he pitied him but could not think of uniting his daughter to a man whose superiority of circumstances was derived from his own ruin  Old Hinckley finding all remonstrances useless by some mercenary agents persuaded Mr Sladon that young Hinckley was privy to and assisting in his ruin The circumstances made it plausible  he believed it and forbade him his house Maria would have credited it of any other man in this case it was dubious her love for him was partial but as she had looked upon the father formerly in the best light she doubted whether she might not be deceived in the son She was in this wavering opinion when the only servant Mr Sladon had brought her a letter from young Hinckley she knew the hand she eagerly caught it she recollected and dropped it on the ground after a long struggle between duty and love she sent it back unopened When a person of good sense and strong natural parts has not the happiness of a religious education he is generally a Deist or Socinian This was the case with young Hinckley his father endeavouring to qualify him for commerce neglected Christianity to the most refined notions of honour and morality he united an absolute contempt for religion his passions were violent but as he was continually on his guard they seldom appeared When he heard that Maria had returned his letter he raved to the utmost extravagance of madness then appearing calm he sat down and writing a letter sealed it and left it on the table Having done this he went into his chamber and immediately shot himself  Old Hinckley hearing the explosion ran from his compter and ascending the stairs saw his son extended breathless He fainted and continued in that condition till his servants occasionally coming in recovered him  The letter which was directed to his father contained what follows  I shall not accuse your conduct for you are my father I shall only endeavour to vindicate the action I am about to perpetrate This will be easily done There is a principle in man a shadow of the Divinity which constitutes him the image of God you may call it conscience grace inspiration the spirit or whatever name your education gives it If a man acts according to this regulator he is right if contrary to it he is wrong It is an approved truth that this principle varies in every rational being As I can reconcile suicide to this principle with me it is consequently no crime Suicide is sometimes a noble insanity of the soul and often the result of a mature and deliberate approbation of the soul If ever a crime it is only so to society there indeed it always appears an irrational emotion but when  our being becomes dissocial when we neither as  ist or are assisted by society we do not injure it by laying down our load of life It may seem a paradoxical assertion that we cannot do wrong to ourselves but it is certain we have power over our own existence Such is my opinion and I have made use of such power  GEORGE HINCLEY  This seeming philosophy was lost on old Hinckley he was really affected with the loss of his son and did not survive him three months  Maria the beautious Maria had a still shorter date She heard the fatal news and expired within a weekMr Sladon loved his daughter too well to live without her he compleated the tragedy and sunk to the grave resigned and contented amidst the chastisements of Providence  ELEGY TO THE MEMORY OF MR THOMAS CHATTERTON LATE OF BRISTOL  HOW
