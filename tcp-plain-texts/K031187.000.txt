 ATYS AND ADRASTUS A TALE In the Manner of  DRYDEN  'S FABLES  By Mr WILLIAM WHITEHEAD Fellow of  ClareHall  in  Cambridge  Infelix Nati funus crudele videbis  Hi nostri reditus expectatique triumphi  Haec mea magna fides  Virg Aen viii  LONDON  Printed for R MANBY on  Ludgate Hill  And Sold by M COOPER in  Paternoster Row  MDCCXLIV  Price One Shilling  This Story is related in the first Book of  Heredotus  's History The Author is translated from the Greek by Mr  Littlebury  ATYS and ADRASTUS A TALE  WHERE  Hermus'  Waters wash the  Lydian  Strand  The pow'rful  Craesus  stretch'd his wide Command  A Warriour King whose willing Subjects bow'd  To sceptred Worth superior to the Croud  Vast was his Wealth for Conquest swell'd his Store  Nor what enrich'd the Prince had left the People poor  Two Sons he had alike in outward Mien  The tender Pledges of a dying Queen  But speechless one ne'er taught his Sire to melt  With lisping Eloquence by Parents felt  And mimic Art in vain Expedients sought  To form the Tongue and free th' imprison'd Thought  Yet blooming  Atys  well that Loss supply'd  Atys  the People's Hope and Monarch's Pride  His beauteous Soul thro' every Feature glow'd  And from his Lips such soft Persuasion flow'd  As Nature had withheld the Brother's Share  Only to pour a double Portion there  But vain those Graces since conceal'd from View  They droop in Shades and wither where they grew  For one dread Night as o'er the weary King  The drowsy God had stretch'd his leaden Wing  He seem'd he knew not where in Wars engag'd  And whilst around the doubtful Battle rag'd  Saw from some hostile Hand unerring Part  A fatal Spear that pierc'd his  Atys'  Heart  He starts he wakes'Tis Night and Silence all  Yet scarce confirm'd he still beholds him fall  Still bleeds in Fancy's Eye the gaping Wound  On Fancy's Ear the dying Groans resound  Again he sleeps the same sad Scenes return  Restless he rolls and waits the ling'ring Morn  What can he do or how prevent a Doom  Which Heav'n foretels and Fate has said shall come  "And yet perhaps the Gods these Dreams inspire  "To save the guiltless Son and warn the Sire  "Too fond of Arms I've wander'd far astray  "While Youth and blind Ambition led the Way  "And ravag'd Countries may perhaps demand  "This bleeding Sacrifice for Wrongs sustain'd  "Then hear me Gods propitious while I swear  "Peace only Peace shall be my future Care  "O wou'd your Powers but save my darling Boy  "No more this Breast shall glow this Arm destroy  "Nor e'er shall  Atys  the dire Sport pursue  "Still in my Court and seldom from my View  "In Ease inglorious shall he pass his Days  "Untaught to feel th' insatiate Lust of Praise  He spake and cautious far away remov'd  From  Atys  what next  Atys  most he lov'd  The Pomp of War No Falchions guard the Gate  And Chiefs unarm'd around his Palace wait  Nay farther still extends a Parent's Fear  Ev'n Arms themselves he dreads and most the Spear  Nor leaves of ancient Wars the weak Remains  But strips their Trophies from the mould'ring Fanes  Lest fixt too loosely form the faithless Stone  The casual Steel shou'd drop and pierce his Son  Thus some sweet Warbler of the feather'd Throng  Deep in the thorny Brake secures her Young  Yet vainly anxious feels a fancied Woe  And starts at every Breeze that stirs the Bough  With silent Horror hears the whisp'ring Groves  And distant Murmurs of the Spring she loves  Unhappy Sire but vainly we oppose  Weak human Caution when the Gods are Foes  Thy Story's Sequel must too surely prove  That Dreams prophetic Dreams descend from  Jove  Nor yet shall  Atys  thwart thy fond Designs  He moves implicit as his Sire inclines  On every Look his eager Duty hung  And read his Wishes e'er they reach'd his Tongue  With Smiles he strips his Helmet's plumy Pride  With Smiles he lays his useless Spear aside  Nor lets one Sigh confess a latent Care  Reserving all his Griefs for his  Adrastus'  Ear  Adrastus  early did his Soul approve  Brave virtuous learn'd and form'd for  Atys'  Love  A  Phrygian  Youth whom Fate condemn'd to roam  An exil'd Wand'rer from a cruel Home  For yet a Boy his inadvertent Lance  An Infant Brother slew the Crime of Chance  In vain he wept no Expiation knew  And loaded with a Father's Curse withdrew  But not in vain the Gods such Ills dispence  If softey'd Pity takes her Rise from hence  If hence we learn to feel another's Pain  And from our own Misfortunes grow humane  This young  Adrastus  found and hence confess'd  That mild Benevolence that warm'd his Breast  Hence too his Fortune stretch'd a bolder Wing  And plac'd her Wand'rer near the  Lydian  King  There long the favour'd Youth exalted shone  Dear to the Sire but dearer to the Son  And pow'rful Sympathy their Hearts had join'd  In stronger Ties than Gratitude can bind  With him did  Atys  every Sport pursue  That Health demands and earlier Ages knew  At Morn at Eve at sultry Noon with him  He rov'd the sunny Lawn he swam the Stream  Beside the Brook that dimpling glides away  Caught the cool Breeze and lur'd the finny Prey  Urg'd the light Car along th' indented Mead  Or hung impetuous o'er the looserein'd Steed  Beneath whose Hoof unhurt the Flowrets rise  And the light Grass scarce trembles as he flies  But chief he lov'd to range the Woods among  And hear the Music of  Adrastus'  Tongue  With graceful Ease unlock the letter'd Store  For that he learn'd from him endear'd the Knowledge more  Of  Thales'  Wisdom oft the Converse ran  How varying Nature's beauteous Frame began  And erst to different Forms the Waters flow'd  As o'er the Chaos mov'd the breathing God  And how confirm'd when some few Years had roll'd  Expecting Nations did at length behold  Predicted Horrors of a darken'd Sun  And Spheres that shone with Lustre not their own  Of  Solon  too he spake and Laws design'd  To guard fair Freedom not enslave Mankind  And hinted oft what mutual Duties spring  'Twixt willing Subjects and their Father King  How close connected Greatness was with Pain  What earthly Bliss and who the happy Man  Nor less the while his youthful Breast he warms  With pictur'd Fights the Theory of Arms  Lest Honour's Barrier shou'd be quite o'erthrown  And Virtue weaken'd e'er she mounts the Throne  Thee  Homer  thee with Rapture they peruse  Expand the Soul and take in all the Muse  Mix with thy Gods with War's whole Ardor burn  Or melt in silent Tears o'er  Hector  's Urn  How oft transported wou'd young  Atys  cry  "Thus might I fight 'twere glorious thus to die  "But why to me are useless Precepts given  "Tied down and pinion'd by the Will of Heav'n  "No early Wreaths my coward Youth must claim  "No just Ambition warm me into Fame  "Hid from the World to rust in Sloth and buy  "A poor precarious Life with Infamy  "Happy thrice happy on each hostile Strand  "The Youths that perish'd by my Father's Hand  "Their Honor still survives and o'er their Tombs  "Their Country's Tears descend and Laurel blooms  "To Life alone the Victor Sword's confin'd  "Wou'd you indeed distress employ a Love too kind  As oft  Adr√†stus  studious to controul  With Reason's Calm the Tumult of the Soul  Wou'd hint to what Excess soever wrought  Paternal Fondness was a venial Fault  Perhaps as lenient Time stole gently on  His Fears might soften or be quite o'erblown  And Sunbright Honour only be delay'd  Awhile to burst more glorious from the Shade  "Yet think" he cried "whatever they appear  "Few are the Causes can excuse a War  "To raise th' Opprest to curb th' insulting Proud  "Or shou'd your injur'd Country call aloud  "Rush rush to Arms 'tis glorious then to dare  "Delay is Cowardice and Doubt Despair  "But let not idler Views your Breast enflame  "Of boundless Kingdoms and a dreaded Name  "'Tis yours at Home to stem Oppression's Waves  "To guard your Subjects not encrease your Slaves  "On this just Basis Fame's firm Column raise  "And be Desert in Arms your second Praise"  'Twas thus in Converse Day succeeding Day  They wore unfelt the tedious Hours away  Till  Atys'  twentieth Year to bloom began  And the Boy rose insensibly to Man  What now shall  Croesus  find what  Syren  Voice  To make Retirement the Result of Choice  No Father's stern Command these Years allow  A Chain more pleasing must detain him now  In rosy Fetters shall the Youth be tied  And  Mysia  's Captive Fair the chosen Bride  Haste gentle God whose Chains unite the Globe  Known by the blazing Torch and saffron Robe  To  Lydia  haste for  Atys  blames your Stay  Nor fair  Idalia  's Blushes brook Delay  O'er Glory's Blaze your soft Enchantments breathe  And hide the Laurel with the Myrtle Wreath  And now the King with secret Transport found  His Hopes succeed nor fears a martial Wound  While lost in Love the happier  Atys  lies  The willing Victim of  Idalia  's Eyes  O thoughtless Man from hence thy Sorrows flow  The Scheme projected to avert the Blow  But makes it surefor see from  Mysia  's Land  Round list'ning  Atys  crouds a suppliant Band  Their Tears their Cries his easy Breast assail  Fond to redress them e'er he hears their Tale  "A mighty Boar the Curse of angry Heav'n  "Had from their Homes the wretched Suff'rers driv'n  "Waste were their viny Groves their rising Grain  "Their Herds their Flocks th' attendant Shepherds slain  "And scarce themselves survive  "O wou'd but  Atys'  lead the hunter Train  "Again their viny Groves their waving Grain  "Might rise secure their Herds their Flocks encrease  "And fair  Idalia  's Country rest in Peace"  The Youth assents th' exulting Crouds retire  When thus impatient speaks the trembling Sire  "What means my Son preserv'd alas in vain  "From hostile Squadrons and the tented Plain  "To rush on Deathrecal your rash Design  "Mine be the Blame and be the Danger mine  "Myself will lead the Band" The Youth return'd  While his flush'd Cheek with mild Resentment burn'd  "Will  Croesus  lead the Band a Hunter now  "Skill'd in the Fight and Laurels on his Brow  "Alas such Mockeries of War become  "The Loit'rer  Atys  fearful of his Doom  "To him at least these Triumphs be resign'd  "That not entirely useless to Mankind  "His Days may pass These Triumphs all his Aim  "These humble Triumphs scarce allied to Fame  "And yet dread Sir if you command his Stay  "O force of Duty  Atys  must obey  "Alas on you whatever Blame shall fall  "A Father's Fondness can excuse it all  "But me of me if still your Power withstands  "What must the  Lydian  what the  Mysian  Bands  "What must  Idalia  think"  Adrastus  here  Soft interpos'd "Great King dismiss your Fear  "Nor longer  Atys'  first Request oppose  "War was your Dream no War this Region knows  "For humbler Prey the Hunters range the Wood  "Their Spears fly innocent of human Blood  "Then fear not themOr had the phantom Boar  "Dug deep the Wound and drank the vital Gore  "That dreadful Vision had excus'd your Care  "Nor  Atys  offer'd an unheeded Prayer  "I love the Prince and but I think his Life  "Safe as my own would urge him from the Strife  "Permit him Sirthis Arm shall guard him there  "And safely may you trust  Adrastus'  Care  "For shou'd he fall this Arm wou'd surely prove  "My Bosom feels a more than Father's Love"  As when impetuous thro' th' autumnal Sky  Urg'd by the Winds the Clouds disparting fly  O'er the broad Wave or wide extended Mead  Shifts the quick Beam alternate Light and Shade  So glanc'd the Monarch's Mind from Thought to Thought  So in his varying Face the Passions wrought  Oft on his Son he turn'd a doubtful Eye  Afraid to grant nor willing to deny  Oft rais'd it tearful to the blest Abodes  And sought in vain the unregarding Gods  Then look'd consent But added with a Groan  "From thee  Adrastus  I expect my Son"  Why shou'd I tell impatient for the Fight  How  Atys  chid the ling'ring Hours of Night  Or how the roseate Morn with early Ray  Streak'd the glad East and gradual spread the Day  When forth he issued like the  Lycian  God  Loose to the Breeze his hov'ring Mantle flow'd  Wav'd the light Plume above behind him hung  His rat'ling Quiver and his Bow unstrung  He mounts his Steed the Steed obey'd the Rein  Arch'd his high Neck and graceful paw'd the Plain  E'vn  Croesus'  self forgot a while his Fear  Of future Ills and gaz'd with Transport there  Or why relate when now the Train withdrew  How fair  Idalia  sigh'd a soft adieu  How  Croesus  follow'd with his Voice and Eyes  Fond to behold but fonder to advise  And oft repeated as they journey'd on  "From thee  Adrastus  I expect my Son"  Suffice it us they leave the Waves that flow  O'er Beds of Gold and  Tmolus'  fragrant Brow  They pass  Magnesia  's Plains  Caicus'  Stream  The  Mysian  Bound that chang'd his ancient Name  And reach  Olympus'  Verge whose Summit nods  O'er  Phrygian  Fields nor boasts assembled Gods  Here Desolation spread her ghastly Reign  O'er trampled Vines and dissipated Grain  And saw with Joy revolving Seasons smile  To swell her Pomp and mock the Lab'rers Toil  Led by her baleful Steps the Youth explore  His dark Retreats and rouse the foaming Boar  Hard was the Strife his horny Sides repel  Unting'd the plumy Shaft and blunted Steel  The Dogs lie mangled o'er the bleeding Plain  And many a Steed and many a Youth was slain  When now his wellaim'd Bow  Adrastus  drew  Twang'd the stretch'd String the feather'd Vengeance flew  And ras'd the Monster's Neck he roars he flies  The Croud pursues the Hills resound their Cries  Full in the Centre of a Vale embrown'd  With arching Shades they close the Savage round  He wheels he glares he meditates his Prey  Resolv'd to strike resolv'd to force his Way  But  Atys  timely stop'd his fierce Career  And thro' his Eyeball sent the whizzing Spear  And joyful saw him reel with eager Speed  He bares his shining Blade he quits his Steed  "Ah stop rash Youth not Conquest you pursue  "Death revels there the wretched Victim you  "You rush on Fate"in vainhe reach'd the Beast  He rais'd his Arm and now had pierc'd his Breast  When in that Moment from the adverse Throng  A Heav'ndirected Spear  Adrastus  flung  Glanc'd o'er the falling Beast the fated Wood  And fix'd in  Atys'  Breast drank deep the vital Flood  The strugling Prince impatient of the Wound  Writh'd on the Spear the Crouds enclose him round  Then sunk in Death unknowing whence it came  Yet ev'n in Death he call'd  Adrastus'  Name  "Where flies  Adrastus  from his dying Friend  "O bear me near" Poor Prince thy Life must end  Not in thy Murderer's Arms he hears thee not  Like some sad Wretch fix'd to the fatal Spot  Where fell the Bolt of Jove nor Ear nor Eye  Nor Arm to help nor Language to reply  Nor Thought itself is his Oblig'd to move  As they direct his Steed he leaves the Grove  As they direct to  Sardis'  Towers again  In Silence follows the returning Train  There too we turn for there the pensive Sire  Now hopes now fears and pines with vain Desire  In every Dust before the Wind that flies  In every distant Cloud that stains the Skies  He sees his Son return till oft deceiv'd  No more his Eye the flattering Scene believ'd  Yet still he wander'd and with Looks intent  The fatal Road his darling  Atys  went  There to averted Heav'n he tells his Pain  And slaughter'd Hecatombs decrees in vain  There to  Idalia  frequent by his Side  Relates his Fears or sooths the weeping Bride  With Tales of  Atys'  Worth and points the Place  Where late he parted from their last Embrace  And now perchance in Tears they linger'd there  When slowlymoving real Crouds appear  "What means" he cried and shot a trembling Eye  A Youth deputed by the rest drew nigh  And in sad Accents told the dreadful Tale  Rage seiz'd the King expiring breathless pale  Idalia  sinks th' attendant Fair convey  With Tears and Shrieks the beauteous Load away  "Where is the Wretchhear hospitable Jove  "Is this is this thy more than Father's Love  "Give me my Sonwhy stare thy haggard Eyes  "As fix'd in Grief  here  only Sorrow lyes"  And smote his Breast "thy Life in Blood began  "A fated Wretch a Murd'rer e'er a Man  "O foolish King by my Indulgence stole  "This Serpent near me that has stung my Soul  "This thy Return for all a King could shower  "Of Bounty o'er thee Life and Wealth and Power  "But what are those How great soe'er they be  "I gave thee more I gave myself to thee  "I gave thee  Atys  link'd in Friendship's Chain  "O fatal Gift if thus return'd again  "Reach me a Swordand yet dear bleeding Clay  "Can his can thousand Lives thy Loss repay"  Then burst in Tears "Heav'ns Instrument I blame  "Tho' by  his  Hand from Heav'n the Vengeance came  "This Stroke O  Solon  has convinc'd my Pride  "O had I never liv'd or earlier died  "Alas poor Wretch why dost thou bare thy Breast  "And court my Sword tho' lost himself to Rest  "This curst of Heav'n this  Croesus  can forgive  "Th' unhappy Cause and bids the Murd'rer live"  "Ah stop" he cried" and write the milder Fate  "Here with thy Sword I only liv'd for that  "Undone I thought beyond Misfortune's Power  "O do not by Forgiveness curse me more"  While yet he pleaded to the mourning Croud  Forth rush'd  Idalia  by her Maids pursu'd  Eager she seem'd with light Suspicions fill'd  And on her Face Heartpiercing Madness smil'd  "Where is my wand'ring Love ye  Lydians  say  "Does he indeed along  Meander  stray  "And rove the  Asian  PlainI'll seek him there  "Ye  Lydian  Damsels of your Hearts beware  "Fair is my Love as to the sunny Beam  "The lightspread Plumage on  Cayster  's Stream  "His Locks are  Hermus'  Gold his Cheeks outshine  "The Ivory tinctur'd by your Art divine  "I see him now in  Tmolus'  Shade he lies  "On saffron Beds soft Sleep has seal'd his Eyes  "His Breath adds Sweetness to the Gale that blows  "Tread light ye Nymphs I'll steal on his Repose  "Alas he bleeds O Murder  Atys  bleeds  "And o'er his Face a dying Paleness spreads  "Help Help  Adrastus  can you leave him now  "In Death neglect him Once it was not so  "What and not weep a Tear at least is due  "Unkind  Adrastus  he'd have wept for you  "Come then my Maids our Tears shall wash the Gore  "We too will die since  Atys  is no more  "But first we'll strow with Flowers the hallow'd Ground  "Where lies my Love and plant the Cypress round  "Nor let  Adrastus  know for should he come  "New Streams of Blood wou'd issue from the Tomb  "The Flowers wou'd wither at his baleful Tread  "And at his Touch the sick'ning Cypress fade  "Come comenay do not tear me from his Side  "Cruel  Adrastus  am I not his Bride  "I mustI willme wou'd you murder too"  At this unable to sustain his Woe  "My Soul can bear no more"  Adrastus  cries  His Eyes on Heav'n "Ye Powers that rule the Skies  "If your august unerring Wills decreed  "That States and Kings and Families must bleed  "Why was I singl'd to perform the Part  "Unsteel'd my Soul unpetrified my Heart  "What had I done a Child an embrio Man  "E'er Passions cou'd unfold or Thought began  "Yet then condemn'd an infant Wretch I fled  "Blood on my Hands and Curses on my Head  "O had I perish'd sobut Fortune smil'd  "To make her Frowns more direThis vagrant Child  "Became the Friend of Kings to curse them all  "And with new Horrors dignify his Fall"  Then eager snatch'd his Sword "for Murders past  "What have I not endur'dbe this my last"  And pierc'd his Breast "This fated Arm shall pour  "Your Streams of Wrath and hurl your Bolts no more  "For Pangs sustain'd Oblivion's all I crave  "O let my Soul forget them in the Grave  "Alas forgive the Wretch your Judgments Doom  "Dark are your Ways I wander in the Gloom  "Nor shou'd perhaps complainBe Grief  my  Share  "But if your Heav'n has Mercy pour it there  "On yon heartbroken King on yon distracted Fair"  He spake and drew the Steel the weeping Train  Support him to the Bier he grasps the Slain  There feels the last sad Joy his Soul desires  And on his  Atys'  muchlov'd Breast expires  O happy Both if ought my Muse cou'd shed  Of "Tears eternal that embalm the Dead"  While round  Britannia  's Coast old Ocean raves  And to her Standard roll th' embattled Waves  Fair Empress of the Deep so long your Names  Shou'd live lamented by her brightest Dames  Who oft at Evening shou'd with Tears relate  The murder'd Friend and poor  Idalia  's Fate  And oft enquiring from their Lovers hear  How  Croesus  mourn'd a twice revolving Year  Then rous'd at  Cyrus'  Name and Glory's Charms  Shook off enervate Grief and shone again in Arms  FINIS  Lately
