with rustic but handsome ornaments On one side are Apollo as Lycidas and Aminta sitting at a pinasorte Dorus Bacchus and Neptune drinking  AIR  Apollo  c  Do re mi fa sol la sol do  Even easy gentle go  That the notes may smoothly flow  Not too fast nor yet too slow  Dorus  Take a toper's toastmay the vine  In the Zodiac be a thirteenth sign  A star that shall its influence shed  To light the drunkards home to bed  Apollo  Do mi sol re fa la sol mi  See see see  Who struck B  Mi  Take care for if you lose the key  You'll lose what's worse the harmony  Nep  Take a sailor's toastmay grog  As through the voyage of life we jog  Still the faithful pilot prove  That steers us to the port of love  Apollo  c  Do re mi fa sol la sol do  Even easy gently go  That the notes may smoothly flow  Not to fast nor yet too slow  Chorus  Let's drink and sing and love and fight  Each pursue his own delight  The string the fair the sword the bowl  Shall melt tune cheer or nerve the soul  That so we may be fitted for  Music and wine and love and war  RECITATIVE  Dorus  Come t'other pull at the decanter  I say you tory rory ranter  You shall be Bacchus I Silenus  And pitch and oakum here between us  Shall be the ass  Aminta  And so you tell us  They're both quite out of date  Apollo  Those fellows  Parcel and Handel with their knowledge  Yes we proceed Ma'am in our college  On a new plan we've changed our note  Since Arne compos'd what Milton wrote  And in the present institution  Music's given up for execution  Troth I shall have a heavy loss in  Ballow my boy and Jemmy Dawson  Margaret's ghost and hapless Peg  This last I love  Apollo  Sing it I beg  You'll jeer me  Apollo  No Ma'am  Bacchus  Never fear it  Nep  Tip us the ditty  Dorus  Ay let's hear it  AIR  And did you hear what sad disaster  Poor Peg of Mapledown befel  For love which stoutest hearts can master  Alas that those who love so well  In sorrow's train  Should mourn in vain  Her story does such grief impel  That woe is me the while I tell  II  She loved a youth of honest kindred  At church behold the happy pair  And ask what 'twas their bliss that hinder'd  For he was young and the was fair  Accursed be wars  And party jars  Why must the handsome danger share  Alas it fills me with despair  III  Onward to his liege lord's dwelling  A rebel rout had cut their way  What shrieks ensued and what a yelling  For he a true man must away  He swore the fight  Would end ere night  And he'd return with garlands gay  Sweet trophies for his wedding day  VI  Night came and saw the youth returning  Accurs'd be war's destructive knife  She ran to clasp with passion burning  Her wedded lorddeprived of life  Oh cruel spright  What not one night  Is not her tale with misery rife  At once a maiden and a wife  RECITATIVE  Apollo  Cara Carissima  Dor  To the matter  These here three suterers seek my dature  I'm all for Bacchus  Luff old soakum  Nep  His chance a'nt worth a pinch of oakham  Well what say you Why as it were  I can't Miss quaver you an air  Like Nipchcese yonder fine and finicle  If one we sing abast the binnacle  Would suit d'ye see why I'd unship it you  O of all things then here goes tip it you  AIR  A sailor and an honest heart  Like ship and helm are ne'er apart  For how should one stem wind and tide  If tother should refuse to guide  With that she freely cuts the waves  And so the tar  When clashing waves arround him jar  Consults his heart and dangers braves  Where duty calls nor asks for more  Than grog aboard and girl ashore  II  'Tis not a thousand leagues from home  More horrid that the billows foam  'Tis not that gentler is the breeze  In Channel than in distant seas  Danger surrounds him far and near  But honest tar  Though winds and waters round him jar  Consults his heart and scorns to fear  The risks he runs endears him more  To grog on board and girl ashore  III  'Tis not that in the hottest fight  The murd'rous ball will sooner light  On that than any other spot  To face the cannon is his lot  He must of dangers have his share  But honest tar  Though fire and winds and water jar  Consults his heart and shakes off care  And when the battle's heat is o'er  In grog aboard drinks girl ashore  Apollo Neptune Bacchus Dorus Aminta  and  Mopsa  RECITATIVE  Mopsa  Sir Sir I've fetch'd your musicianers  Apolle  Thou art my sweetest of commissioners  I'll go prepare the concert Madam  Thou shalt have oceans  Mopsa  If you had 'em  O never fear you shall be paid  All is not lost that is delayed  A pig by keeping up gets fat  Oh ho Sir if you're good at that  Mop  AIR  I can proverb it tooNe'er lean on a rush  A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush  'Tis the money paid that decides who's the winner  Who waits upon fortune's ne'er sure of a dinner  Out of sight out of mind delaying breeds danger  He ought to be cozened who trusts to a stranger  Heaven take my friend and the old one my brother  Promising's one thing performing another  II  Much may fall out 'twixt the cup and the lip  The builder's receipt's the best sail in the ship  'Tis a good thing to lend but a btter to borrow  Pay me today and I'll trust you tomorrow  Brag is a good dog but holdfast a better  One may guess at a word when one knows the first letter  There's not the most fire where we see the most smother  Promising's one thing performing another  RECITATIVE  Bacchus  Now Ma'am for me  Dorus  That's right lad crack us  The praise o' th' bottle my bold Bacchus  Aminta  I've heard you all and in good sooth  To say I love not were not truth  For I do love and that not slenderly  But truly constantly and tenderly  Now do I keen impatience trace  In the jolly toper's ruddy face  My bard's inspiredMy tar tacks short  And thinks he soonshall make his port  Which is it toper tar or poet  ListenI'll tell you how to know it  AIR  What time the vesper bell shall sing  The holy priests to call  Him to the temple love must bring  Who does my heart enthral  It may be you or you or you  Would you know who  Come all  See how each brow with sadness lours  Poor souls what fears distress 'em  Come don't complain  A few short hours  Will put you fairly out of pain  Without suspense love ever cloys  And we must first imagine joys  Before we can possess 'em  RECITATIVE  Dorus  I'm all for Bacchus  Bacchus  I shall pass about  To such a toast with joy the glass about  Apollo  Ye hours till then be feathered feeted  Neptune  Your signal Ma'am shall be repeated  Aminta  In short each tells me in his lingo  He'll fail me notO love by jingo  Thy power all other power surpasses  Thou turn'st the wisest men to asses  Oh for a simile to utter  What thou art likeCome you who mutter  So much of torments which ye prove  Like to something this same love  AIR  Apollo  Love's a fireIf fire you view  How beautiful and bright  What kindly warmth when heavenly hue  How goodly to the sight  But touch it how it burns  And so is love as bright as fair  Seen in a lovely face  A snowey bosom auburn hair  Or figure moved with grace  But felta serpent turns  Mopsa  II  Love is wineThe wine you sip  All evils can controul  And pleasure from the quivering lip  Soon reaches to the soul  Drink deepYou're drunk my lad  And so it is if love you try  While you can have the art  To let it gratify the eye  And never touch the heart  For then 'twill drive you mad  Appollo  III  Love's the DevilWhat is he not  He's every form and hue  He's short and tall and cold and hot  And black and white and blue  And till he buys you civil  So love still under every form  Changing a thousand ways  True and false and cold and warm  Goes on till he betrays  Exactly like the Devil  CATCH  To Cupid then let us be civil  And flaming altars rear him  Like Indians who they say the Devil  Adore because they fear him  END of the FIRST ACT  ACT II  Scene continuesPlutus  RECITATIVE  I've underta'en a job for Hercules  Or the Devil when in a conjuror's circle he is  Or Atlas's toil or Jason's travel  Or Theseus's lab'rynth to unravel  And were it not for this I thank it  I know they'd toss me in a blanket  Mopsa crossing the stage  Plutus  HereMolly Sukey Jenny Betty  What is your nameyou're dev'lish pretty  Mopsa  I wish I could return the compliment  Plutus  Nay nay 'twas not your brow to rumple I meant  I'd serve you  Mopsa  Ay so say the rest of you  To serve themselvesAh bad's the best of you  Plutus  Why what has put thee in this humour  Mopsa  My lady's handsome  Plutus  So says rumour  Mopsa  And has three sparksYet friend of mine  I ne'er saw colour of their quine  Plutus  The fourth shall make up their omission  And I am heOn one condition  Mopsa  What is't  Plutus  That you a good word speak for me  Mopsa  A better post you could not seek for me  Plutus  There's earnest then  Mopsa  A note for twenty  I can't give change  Plutus  O I have plenty  Keep it yourself  Mopsa  Lord you're so free of 'em  You said you'd pay for all there's three of them  Plutus  And here three notesWell now regard me  And see what share of praise you award me  If now I'm ugly 'twere a strange ill  Mopsa  UglyYou're handsome as an angel  AIR  I vow I thought you at first sight  A moppet a baboon a fright  Or some hobgobbling of the night  Who guilty creatures waken  With nose and chin like ramshorns curled  And brows in furrowed wrinkles furled  Well 'tis amazing in this world  How one may be mistaken  II  For now I see with half an eye  You are not old nor made awry  Nor do your shambling trotters ply  As if by palsy shaken  You're young as Ganymede and fair  Narcissus had not such an air  Well 'tis amazing I declare  How one may be mistaken  SCENE III  Plutus Dorus  RECITATIVE  Plutus  I've gain'd Ma'am Abigail for ever  Here comes the fathernow or never  Dorus  Hey boys for Bacchus  Plutus  Fill your glasses  Confusion to all sober asses  Dorus  Who's thiswhy damn it you're a joker  Bacchus for everhey old soaker  Plutus  Why Bacchus is a clever feller  But Plutus 'tis who fills the cellar  Which 'twixt ourselves will better suit us  Dorus  Is itthen here goeshey for Plutus  Well hang me but I like your notion  Plutus  Ay ay there lies your true devotion  And if you've any thing to say to him  I'll tell you in what way to pray to him  Dorus  Who are you then that overwhelm me so  Plutus  I'm his high priest  Dorus  Why you don't tell me so  Plutus  Have charge of every bag and coffer  Which for your daughter's love I offer  Dorus  But Sir she has another lover  Who when he chances to discover  Indeed she has three but Quaverino  Is her own choicea monstrous Geno  Plutus  Hehang him whezened creaturefulsomer  Than Doll he dances on his Ducimer  He handsome clever witty courteous  Author of any thing that's virtuous  Or ought of merit the contriver  The fellow is not worth a stiver  Dorus  Indeed That argument's convincing  Plutus  What signifies the matter mincing  AIR  He's poor as Job and Siryou twig me  Can he be tall  Dorus  Sir he's a Pigmy  Plutus  Or handsome  Dorus  Uglier than a lizard  Plutus  Or strait  Dorus  As crooked as an Izard  Plutus  Honest  Dorus  He's one of your trapanners  Plutus  Well bred  Dorus  A bear has better manners  Plutus  RECITATIVE  And as to all his tricks and fancies  His fortunetelling and romances  Our good or our ill fate divining  From stars which at our birth were shining  AIR  Why what can he tell us we know all the past  Are content with the fate we're at present possessing  And if for the future our lot's are all cast  We might there find a curse where we hope for a blessing  What's hid in the stars then is not worth our care  We shall know it too soon if 'tis any vexation  If 'tis good fortune pleasure's a little too rare  To rob ourselves of it by anticipation  II  What folly 'twere then in the myst'ries of fate  To drive by a vain idle impulse directed  The knowledge of ill cannot lessen its weight  And pleasure's most welcome when least it's expected  What's hid c  SCENE IV  To them AMINTA  Dorus  Here comes my daughter  Plutus  At her studies  Dorus  Her mad tide as the highest flood is  Anintas  With his own genius he has fired me  He has transported meinspired me  Sweet Lycidas  Dorus  Do'nt prate so fast of him  For once for all you've seen the last of him  Aminta  O Sir consider how he plays  His graces his cantabiles  What taste and judgment there is in 'em  Dorus  Do'nt know a crotchet from a minum  Aminta  Who tells you so  Dorus  That gemman yonder  Aminta  Who when he's ready 's he I wonder  Plutus  One who will prove him a worse tidler  At music than an old blind fidler  And you'll confess it  Aminta  I shallsooner  The solar orb shall yield 't th' lunar  The spheres play discords sound kick  d sense  And the nine muses chatter nonsense  Plutus  Make no rash oathsone little ditty  Of mine's more tasty and more witty  Than all the warblings of that chap  While I strike up you hold your lap  AIR  Tis true the mark of many years  Upon my wrinkled front appears  Yet have I no such mighty fears  This will my fortune spoil  Go'd still each happiness bestows  Ev'n where no youthful ardour glows  For proof dear girl take these rouleaus  And give me one sweet smile  II  'Tis true upon my baggard face  No marks of beauty can you trace  Nor wears my figure ought of grace  To ensure the lover's bliss  Yet am I no such shocking fright  But that bank notes may set things right  Take then these billsall drawn at sight  And give me one sweet kiss  III  'Tis true I know not to be kind  And that within my hardened mind  No more a jewel can you find  Than beauty in my face  But one within this casket here  Shall make amendsit's lustre's clear  Nor shall I think I've sold it dear  Paid by a sweet embrace  At the end of each stanza she hesitates and at last gives him what he asks  RECITATIVE  Plutus  Well is there any thing that's silly in't  Sure never wit was half so brilliant  Plutus  Why yes it matter has and reason  Mopsa  And such as always comes in season  Plutus  From a rough fellow such as me  You'd not expect such poetry  Sir roughest oysters we find pearl in  Dorus  Yes yes his arguments are sterling  Plutus  To Aminta  Well what say you my little sonnet  You see has drawn encomiums on it  From these good people one and 'tother  Amnta  I'll tell you if you'll sing another  P  us  ▪  Hey day what's here  SCENE V  To them Apollo and the Muses  Dorus  You may well stare  The fellow makes my house a fair  Apollo  Ladies and gentlemen be seated  We're perfect every thing's compleated  O you'll be charmed come are you ready  Take careattentionlead off steady  Carefulexpressivelywith gusto  AwaytogetherTempo guisto  AIR  Come round me and weep to your hearts take despair  'Tis a cause that all nature must mourn  Poor Hylas of love who from all had a share  From our wishes for ever is torn  That Hylas to whom we looked up for a smile  As we blessing from heaven obtain  Whose form was so faultless whose tongue knew no guile  Is goneand our wishes are vain  RECITATIVE  Apollo  Well old friend what d'ye say to that  Plutus  I vow I thought it rather flat  Apollo  But you I'm sure with rapture listened  Aminta  Ne'er heard such stuff since I was christened  Mopsa  I thinks it would be rare to meet  Worse ballad singing in the street  Apollo  Your father is asleep I see  How is this  Dorus  EhO don't mind me  I rose just when the morn was dawning  Besides at such stuff how help yawning  Apollo  Ne'er did I see four faces sadder  Plutus  The truth my good friend is you're had here  Apollo  Had  Plutus  Yes your musick was divine  'Till these good people had heard mine  But I by striking upon this chord  Have made your harmony all discord  Wit against goldnext time I prithee  Thou goest to woo take money with thee  This shall assist thee in thy quarrel  'Gainst dull Apollo and his laurel  Apollo  Peace Caitif nor abuse a God  Could crush thee with a single nod  Aminta  Nay prithee friend none of your breezes  This gemman here does what he pleases  Then do not thus our pleasure hinder  Unless you'd be chuck'd out of winder  Come loveliest object of my wishes  And let us leave this fool officious  Poor and make love 'tis past endurance  I never heard of such assurance  AIR  Shall Ithe thought transports me  When diamonds round me shine  When fortune kindly courts me  And so much splendour's mine  Shall I such matchless favours  Ungratefully thus wrong  For semidemi quavers  And to the end of an old song  No no no  Fools alone do so  And so good Sir solo  You come and so may go  No no in your carreer  You're stoptyour tinkling art  Went only through my ear  Like tumbler through a hoop  It never touched my heart  Therefore good Signor troop  Shall I c  Apollo Dorus and Mopsa  Apollo  To Dorus  And pray your promise forgetter  Can you their friend be and abettor  And in their perfidy protect 'em  Promises I don't recollect 'em  Apollo  Why surely sir 'twould not be flattering  Myself  Good friend I can't stand chattering  If you've a brilliant thought your head in  To celebrate my daughter's wedding  You shall be paid for'tWell adieu  I have a thousand things to do  Apollo Dorus and Mopsa  Dorus  How could you write such horrid trash  Such vile inferual stuff  Apollo  You lash  Somewhat too hard  Plutus  I am no fool boy  I'd shew you better from a school boy  And as for musick not to sham it  My good friend you can't say your gamut  Grinding like organ with a barrel  A thing like psalm or Christmas carrol  And glide and languish groan and die  And call it harmony O fie  Would'st hear the Forte the Piano  And the true taste Italiano  Of the composer and the singer too  Pray Madam touch him up a thing or two  AIR  You must begin Pomposo  Incline to the affecttuoso  Thenof the Amoroso  A gentle touch  And now so much for the motivo  Further in your progression  No matter for expression  So that for relievo  You ha  And he  And la  And mi  And sink and break  And trill and shake  And on a long division soar  You'll set the audience in a roar  And now have done with that key  And get into a flat key  Now give us that once more  And take it a note lower  Now the flutes obligato  The fiddles pizzicato  And now a long fermato  Then to the subject come again  And after the motivo  By way of a relievo  Be sure repent that hum again  Of ha  And he  And la  And mi  And sink and break  And trill and shake  Then you must go low  That the horns may have a solo  And then on a division soar  'Twill set the audience in a roar  Apollo Mopsa  Apollo  Give me thy pity and assistance  Dear Mopsa  Mopsa  Pray friend keep your distance  Such imperance indeed  Believe me  Mop  Where's all the gold you said you'd give me  You fidling fellowCome come stir you friend  Pipe somewhere else there's nothing for you friend  Gold then has borne away the palm  Your very humble servant Ma'am  The jadeshe this old grazier chuses  And slights Apollo and Muses  AIR  I thought we were fiddle and bow  So well we in concert kept time  And to strike up a part base and low  Without either reason or rhyme  What a natural was I so soon  With pleasure to quaver away  For I am hummed I think now to some tune  She has left me the piper to pay  II  'Tis plain to perceive she's in glee  And thinks I shall be such a slat  As to shake but she's in a wrong key  For she never shall catch me at that  Whoe'er to the crotchets of love  Let's his heart dance a jig in his breast  'Twill a bar to his happiness prove  And shall surely deprive him of rest  SCENE X  To him  Plutus Dorus Aminta and Mopsa  RECITATIVE  Ptutus  And now good master sonnet monger  We'll carry on the farce no longer  To Aminta  Your other lovers are together  l'th' temple I'll conduct you thither  And yet I think 'twill make less fuss  If we the temple bring to us  Change scene I will it  SCENE the LAST  The TEMPLE of JUPITER  Apollo  At this minute I  Plainly perceive thou'rt some divinity  Come hither in my pranks to catch me  But if know whothe devil fetch me  Plutus  Off then vile dress let what will follow  Apollo  Plutus  Plutus  As sure as thou'rt Apollo  Or Bacchus thou and I'm afraid too  We've Neptune here in masquerade too  Great heroes all yet let me tell you  Plutus can always buy and sell you  Apollo  I do not you advantage envy  Losers fare best when gods with men vie  Who from the vices they inherit  Prefer base gold to sterling merit  Plutus  I thought you'd finish in heroics  The others bear it like two stoics  This tale above stairs will make merry many  But come as master of the ceremony  I've yet to heal this fair one's sorrow  You'll see your Lycidas tomorrow  The real onethis god you've lost here  Was nothing more than an impostor  Those riches I have left you prize  Adieu be happy and be wise  AIR  Apollo  This story fell out which to night we have given t'ye  In the year of the world 'bout a thousand and seventy  So says the traditionand if ought of satire  It contains pray believe we know nought of the matter  'Tis plain to be seen nor is this a lie  For is there one here  To whom 'tis not clear  That in England indulge any folly whatever  Folks never for gold  Are barter'd and sold  For our farce then no one can unkindly apply it  No no we defy it  We paint but the manners of Sicily  Plutus  II  Would a gentleman fain be returned for a borough  Here in England his money could ne'er bring him through  No no he's obliged to leave all at their option  For he ne'er could with brib'ry do ought or corruption  I ask the whole nationIs this a lie  Is a counsellor learned  In a law suit concerned  Most ready for nothing he gives you his trouble  To double  His Fee  With him were no plea  Our farce then no one can unkindly apply it  No no we defy it  We paint but the manners of Sicily  Amtnta  III  Is a treaty of marriage on footthe poor lady  In England ne'er asks if the writings are ready  But blindly accepting whate'er they appoint her  She marries for love and ne'er thinks of a jointure  I appeal to the boxesIs this a lie  As to buying of wares  And such trifling affairs  All the world knows that six out of seven  Are given  Not sold  So light they prize gold  For our farce then no one can unkindly apply it  No no we desy it  We paint but the manners of Sicily  The END
