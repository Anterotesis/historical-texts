 EVERY ONE HAS HIS FAULT A COMEDY IN FIVE ACTS AS IT IS PERFORMED AT THE THEATRE ROYAL COVENTGARDEN  BY MRS INCHBALD  LONDON PRINTED FOR G G J AND J ROBINSON PATERNOSTERROW  PROLOGUE  BY THE REV MR NARES  Spoken by Mr FARREN  OUR Author who accuses great and small  And says so boldly there are faults in all  Sends me with dismal voice and lengthen'd phiz  Humbly to own one dreadful fault of his  A fault in modern Authors not uncommon  It isnow don't be angryHe's  a woman  Can you forgive it Nay I'll tell you more  One who has dar'd to venture here before  Has seen your smiles your frownstremendous sight  O be not in a frowning mood tonight  The Play perhaps has many things amiss  Well let us then reduce the point to this  Let only those that have no failings hiss  The Rights of Women  says a female pen  Are to do every thing as well as Men  To think to argue to decide to write  To talk undoubtedlyperhaps to fight  For Females march to war like brave Commanders  Not in old Authors onlybut in Flanders  I grant this matter may be strain'd too far  And Maid 'gainst Man is most uncivil war  I Grant as all my City friends will say  That Men should rule and Women should obey  That nothing binds the marriage contract faster  Than oura "Zounds Madam I'm your Lord and Master"  I grant their nature and their frailty such  Women may make too freeand know too much  But since the Sex at length has been inclin'd  To cultivate that useful partthe mind  Since they have learnt to read to write to spell  Since some of them have witand use it well  Let us not force them back with brow severe  Within the pale of ignorance and fear  Confin'd entirely to domestic arts  Producing only children pies and tarts  The fav'rite fable of the tuneful Nine  Implies that female genius  is divine  Then drive not Critics with tyrannic rage  A supplicating Fairone from the Stage  The Comic Muse perhaps is growing old  Her lovers you well know are few and cold  'Tis time then freely to enlarge the plan  And let all those write Comediesthat can  DRAMATIS PERSONAE  MEN  Lord Norland  Mr FARREN  Sir Robert Ramble  Mr LEWIS  Mr Solus  Mr QUICK  Mr Harmony  Mr MUNDEN  Mr Placid  Mr

PLACID  And yet your singularity pleases me for you are the first elderly bachelor I ever knew who did not hug himself in the reflection that he was not in the trammels of wedlock  SOLUS  No I am only the first elderly bachelor who has truth and courage enough to confess his dissatisfaction  PLACID  And you really wish you were married  SOLUS  I do I wish still more that I had been married thirty years ago Oh I wish a wife and halfascore children would now start up around me and bring along with them all that affection which we should have had for each other by being earlier acquainted But as it is in my present state there is not a person in the world I care a straw for and the world is pretty even with me for I don't believe there is a creature in it who cares a straw for me  PLACID  Pshaw You have in your time been a man of gallantry and consequently must have made many attachments  SOLUS  Yes such as men of gallantry usually make I have been attached to women who have purloined my fortune and to men who have partaken of the theft I have been in as much fear of my mistress as you are of your wife  PLACID  Is that possible  SOLUS  Yes and without having one of those tender delicate ties of a husband an excuse for my apprehensionI have maintained children  PLACID  Then why do you complain for the want of a family  SOLUS  I did not say I ever had any children I said I had  maintained  them but I never believed they were mine for I could have no dependence upon the principles of their motherand never did I  take one of those tender infants in my arms that the forehead of my Valet the squinteye of my Apothecary or the doublechin of my Chaplain did not stare me in the face and damp all the fine feelings of the parent which I had just called up  PLACID  But those are accidents which may occur in the marriage state  SOLUS  In that case a man is pitiedin mine he is only laughed at  PLACID  I wish to heaven I could exchange the pity which my friends bestow on me for the merriment which your ill fate excites  SOLUS  You want but courage to be envied  PLACID  Does any one doubt my courage  SOLUS  No If a Prince were to offend you you would challenge him I have no doubt  PLACID  But if my wife offend me I am obliged to make an apologyWas not that her voice I hope she has not overheard our conversation  SOLUS  If she have she'll be in an ill humour  PLACID  That she will be whether she have heard it or not  SOLUS  Well goodday I don't like to be driven from my fixed plan of wedlock and therefore I won't be a spectator of your mutual discontent  Going  PLACID  But before you go Mr Solus permit me to remind you of a certain concern that I think would afford you much more delight than all you can at this time of life propose to yourself in marriage Make happy by your beneficence a near relation whom the truest affection has drawn into that state but who is denied the blessing of competency to make the state supportable  SOLUS  You mean my nephew Irwin But do not you acknowledge he has a wife and children Did not he marry the woman he loved and has he not at this moment a large family by whom he is beloved And is he not therefore with all his poverty much happier than I He has often told me when I have reproached him with his indiscreet marriage "that in his wife he possessed kingdoms" Do you suppose I will give any part of my fortune to a man who enjoys such extensive domains Nolet him preserve his territories and I will keep my little estate for my own use  Exit  PLACID  John John  Enter Servant  Has your mistress been enquiring for me  JOHN  Yes SirMy Lady asked just now if I knew who was with you  PLACID  Did she seem angry  JOHN  No Sirpretty well  PLACID  You scoundrel what do you mean by "pretty well"  In anger  JOHN  Much as usual Sir  PLACID  And do you call that "pretty well" You scoundrel I have a great mind  Enter Mrs  PLACID  speaking very loud  Mrs  PLACID  What is the matter Mr Placid What is all this noise about You know I hate a noise What is the matter  PLACID  My dear I was only finding fault with that blockhead  Mrs  PLACID  Pray Mr Placid do not find fault with any body in this house But I have something which I must take  you  very severely to talk about Sir  PLACID  No my dear not just now pray  Mrs  PLACID  Why not now  PLACID  looking at his watch  Because dinner will be ready in a few minutes I am very hungry and it will be cruel of you  to spoil my appetite John is the dinner on table  Mrs  PLACID  No John don't let it be served yetMr Placid you  shall  first hear what I have to say  Sitting down  Exit Servant  PLACID  But then I know I sha'n't be able to eat a morsel  Mrs  PLACID  Sit down  He sits  I believe Mr Placid you are going to do a very silly thing I am afraid you are going to lend some money  PLACID  Well my dear and suppose I am  Mrs  PLACID  Then I don't approve of people lending their money  PLACID  But my dear I have known you approve of borrowing money And once in our lives what should we have done if every body had refused to lend  Mrs  PLACID  That is nothing to the purposeAnd now I desire you will hear what I say without speaking a word yourself  PLACID  Well my dear  Mrs  PLACID  Now mind you don't speak till I have done Our old acquaintance Captain Irwin and Lady  Eleanor his wife with whom we lived upon very intimate terms to be sure while we were in America are returned to London and I find you have visited them very frequently  PLACID  Not above two or three times upon my word for it hurts me to see them in distress and I forbear to go  Mrs  PLACID  There You own they are in distress I expected as much Now own to me that they have asked you to lend them money  PLACID  I do own itI do own it Now are you satisfied  Mrs  PLACID  No for I have no doubt but you have promised they shall have it  PLACID  No upon my word I have not promised  Mrs  PLACID  Then promise me they shall not  PLACID  Nay my dear you have no idea of their distress  Mrs  PLACID  Yes I have and 'tis that which makes me suspicious  PLACID  His regiment is now broken all her jewels and little bawbles are disposed of he is in such dread of his old creditors that in the lodging they have taken he passes by the name of MiddletonThey have three more children my dear than when  we left them in New England and they have in vain sent repeated supplications both to his uncle and her father for the smallest bounty  Mrs  PLACID  And is not Lord Norland her father a remarkably wise man and a good man And ought you to do for them what he has refused  PLACID  They have offended him but they have never offended me  Mrs  PLACID  I think 'tis an offence to ask a friend for money when there is no certainty of returning it  PLACID  By no means for if there  were  a certainty even an enemy might lend  Mrs  PLACID  But I insist Mr Placid that they shall not find a friend in you upon this occasionWhat do you say Sir  PLACID  after a struggle  No my dear they shall not  Mrs  PLACID  Positively shall not  PLACID  Positively shall notsince they have found an enemy in you  Enter  SERVANT  SERVANT  Dinner is on table  PLACID  Ah I am not hungry now  Mrs  PLACID  What do you mean by that Mr Placid I insist on your being hungry  PLACID  Oh yes I have a very excellent appetite I shall eat prodigiously  Mrs  PLACID  You had best  Exeunt  SCENE II  An Apartment at Mr  HARMONY's  Enter Mr  HARMONY  followed by Miss  SPINSTER  Miss  SPINSTER  Cousin cousin Harmony I will not forgive you for thus continually speaking in the behalf of every servant whom you find me offended with Your philanthropy becomes insupportable and instead of being a virtue degenerates into a vice  HARMONY  Dear Madam do not upbraid me for a constitutional fault  Miss  SPINSTER  Very true you had it from your infancy I have heard your mother say you were always foolishly tenderhearted and never shewed one of those discriminating passions of envy hatred or revenge to which all her other children were liable  HARMONY  No since I can remember I have felt the most unbounded affection for all my fellow creatures I even protest to you dear Madam that as I walk along the streets of this large metropolis so warm is my heart towards every person who passes me that I long to say "How do you do" and  "I am glad to see you" to them all Some men I should like even to stop and shake hands with and some women I should like even to stop and kiss  Miss  SPINSTER  How can you be so ridiculous  HARMONY  Nay 'tis truth and I sincerely lament that human beings should be such strangers to one another as we are We live in the same street without knowing one another's necessities and oftentimes meet and part from each other at church at coffeehouses playhouses and all public places without ever speaking a single word or nodding "Good bye" though 'tis a hundred chances to ten we never see one another again  Miss  SPINSTER  Let me tell you kinsman all this pretended philanthropy renders you ridiculous There is not a fraud a theft or hardly any vice committed that you do not take the criminal's part shake your head and cry "Provisions are so scarce" And no longer ago than last Lordmayor'sday when you were told that Mr Alderman Ravenous was ill with an indigestion you endeavoured to soften the matter by exclaiming "Provisions are so scarce"But above all I condemn that false humanity which induces you to say many things in conversation which deserve to stigmatize you with the character of deceit  HARMONY  This is a weakness I confess But though my honour sometimes reproaches me with it as a fault my conscience never does for it is by this very failing that I have frequently made the bitterest  enemies friendsJust by saying a few harmless sentences which though a species of falsehood and deceit yet being soothing and acceptable to the person offended I have immediately inspired him with lenity and forgiveness and then by only repeating the selfsame sentences to his opponent I have known hearts cold and closed to each other warmed and expanded as every human creature's ought to be  Enter  SERVANT  SERVANT  Mr Solus  Exit Servant  Miss  SPINSTER  I cannot think Mr Harmony why you keep company with that old bachelor he is a man of all others on earth I dislike and so I am obliged to quit the room though I have a thousand things to say  Exit angrily  Enter  SOLUS  HARMONY  Mr Solus how do you do  SOLUS  I am very lonely at home will you come and dine with me  HARMONY  Now you are here you had better stay with me we have no company only my cousin Miss Spinster and myself  SOLUS  No I must go home do come to my house  HARMONY  Nay pray stay what objection can you have  SOLUS  Why to tell you the truth your relation Miss Spinster is no great favourite of mine and I don't like to dine with you because I don't like her company  HARMONY  That is to me surprising  SOLUS  Why old bachelors and old maids never agree we are too much alike in our habits we know our own hearts so well we are apt to discover every foible we would wish to forget in the symptoms displayed by the other Miss Spinster is peevish fretful and tiresome and I am always in a fidget when I am in her company  HARMONY  How different are her sentiments of you for one of her greatest joys is to be in your company  Solus  starts and smiles  Poor woman she has to be sure an uneven temper  SOLUS  No perhaps I am mistaken  HARMONY  But I will assure you I never see her in half such good humour as when you are here for I believe you are the greatest favourite she has  SOLUS  I am very much obliged to her and I certainly  am  mistaken about her temperSome people if they look ever so cross are goodnatured in the main and I dare say she is so Besides she never has had a husband to sooth and soften her disposition and there should be some allowance made for that  HARMONY  Will you dine with us  SOLUS  I don't care if I do Yes I think I will I must however step home firstbut I'll be back in a quarter of an hourMy compliments to Miss Spinster if you should see her before I return  Exit  Enter  SERVANT  SERVANT  My lady begs to know Sir if you have invited Mr Solus to dine because if you have she shall go out  Exit Servant  Enter Miss  SPINSTER  HARMONY  Yes Madam I could not help inviting him for poor man his own house is in such a state for want of proper management he cannot give a comfortable dinner himself  Miss SPINSTER  And so he must spoil the comfort of mine  HARMONY  Poor man poor man after all the praises he has been lavishing upon you  Miss  SPINSTER  What praises  HARMONY  I won't tell you for you won't believe them  Miss  SPINSTER  Yes I shallOh nonow I recollect this is some of your invention  HARMONY  Nay I told him it was  his  invention for he declared you looked better last night than any other lady at the Opera  Miss  SPINSTER  No this sounds like truth and depend upon it though I never liked the manners of Mr Solus much yet  HARMONY  Nay Solus has his faults  Miss  SPINSTER  So we have all  HARMONY  And will you leave him and me to dine by ourselves  Miss  SPINSTER  Oh no I cannot be guilty of such ill manners though I talked of it Besides poor Mr Solus does not come so often and it would be wrong not to shew him all the civility we can For my part I have no dislike to the man and if taking a bit of dinner with us now and then can oblige either you or him I should be to blame to make any objection Come let us go into the drawingroom to receive him  HARMONY  Ay this is right this is as it should be  Exeunt  SCENE III  A Room at the Lodgings of Mr  IRWIN  Mr  IRWIN  and Lady  ELEANOR IRWIN  discovered  Lady  ELEANOR  My dear husband my dear Irwin I cannot bear to see you thus melancholy Is this the joy of returning to our native country after a nine years banishment  IRWIN  Yes For I could bear my misfortunes my  wretched poverty with patience in a land where our sorrows were shared by those about us but here in London where plenty and ease smile upon every face where by birth you claim distinction and I by serviceshere to be in wantto be obliged to take another name in shame of our ownto tremble at the voice of every stranger for fear he should be a creditorto meet each old acquaintance with an averted eye because we would not feel the pang of being shunnedTo have no reward for all this even in a comfortable home but there to see our children looking up to me for that support I have not in my power to giveCan Ican I love them and you and not be miserable  Lady  ELEANOR  And yet I am not so And I am sure you will not doubt my love to you or them  IRWIN  I met my uncle this morning and was mean enough to repeat my request to himhe burst into a fit of laughter and told me my distresses were the result of my ambition in marrying the daughter of a nobleman who himself was too ambitious ever to pardon us  Lady  ELEANOR  Tell me no more of what he said  IRWIN  This was a day of trialsI saw your father too  Lady  ELEANOR  My father Lord Norland Oh Heavens  IRWIN  He passed me in his carriage  Lady  ELEANOR  I envy you the blessing of seeing him For OhExcuse my tears he is my father still How did he look  IRWIN  As well as he did at the time I used to watch him from his house to steal to youBut I am sorry to acquaint you that to guard himself against all returning love for you he has I am informed adopted a young lad on whom he bestows every mark of that paternal affection of which you lament the loss  Lady  ELEANOR  May the young man deserve his tenderness better than I have doneMay he never disobey him May  he  be a comfort and cherish his benefactor's declining yearsAnd when his youthful passions teach him to love may they not like mine teach him disobedience  Enter a  SERVANT  with a letter  IRWIN  What is that letter  SERVANT  It comes from Mr Placid the servant who brought it said and requires no answer  Exit  IRWIN  It's strange how I tremble at every letter I see as if I dreaded the contents How poverty has unmann'd me  aside  I must tell you my dear that finding myself left this morning without a guinea I wrote to Mr Placid to borrow a small sum This is his answer  reading the superscription  "To Mr Middleton"That's righthe remembers the caution I gave him I had forgot whether  I had for my memory is not so good as it was I did not even recollect this hand though it is one I am so well acquainted with and ought to give me joy rather than sorrow  Opens the letter hastily reads and lets it drop  Now I have not a friend on earth  Lady  ELEANOR  Yes you have me You forget me  IRWIN  in a transport of grief  I would forget youyouand all your children  Lady  ELEANOR  I would not lose the remembrance of you or of them for all my father's fortune  IRWIN  What am I to do I must leave you I must go I know not where I cannot stay to see you perish  Takes his hat and is going  Lady  ELEANOR  holding him  Where would you go 'Tis evening'tis dark Whither would you go at this time  IRWIN  distractedly  I must consider what's to be doneand in this room my thoughts are too confined to reflect  Lady  ELEANOR  And are London streets calculated for reflection  IRWIN  Nofor action To hurry the faint thought to resolution  Lady  ELEANOR  You are not wellYour health has been lately impairedYour temper has undergone a change tooI tremble lest any accident  IRWIN  What accident  Wildly  Lady  ELEANOR  I know your provocations from an ungrateful world But despise it as that despises you  IRWIN  But for your sake I could  Lady  ELEANOR  Then witness Heaven I am happyThough bred in all the delicacy the luxury of wealth and splendour yet I have never murmured at the change of fortune while that change has made me wife to you and mother of your children  IRWIN  We  will  be happyif possible But give me this evening to consider what plan to fix upon There is no time to lose we are without friends without moneywithout creditFarewell for an hourI will see Mr Placid if I can and though he have not the money to lend he may perhaps give me some advice  Lady  ELEANOR  Suppose I call on  her  Women are sometimes more considerate than men and  IRWIN  Do you for the best and so will IHeavens bless you  Exeunt separately  ACT II  SCENE I  A Coffee or Clubroom at a Tavern  Enter Sir  ROBERT RAMBLE  and Mr  SOLUS  and Mr  PLACID  at the opposite Side  SOLUS  SIR Robert Ramble how do you do  Sir  ROBERT  My dear Mr Solus I am glad to see you I have been dining by myself and now come into this public room to meet with some good company  SOLUS  Ay Sir Robert you are now reduced to the same necessity which I frequently amI frequently am obliged to dine at taverns and coffeehouses for want of company at home  Sir  ROBERT  Nay I protest I am never happier than in a house like this where a man may meet his friend without the inconvenience of form either as a host or a visitor  SOLUS  Sir Robert give me leave to introduce to you Mr Placid he has been many years abroad but I believe he now means to remain in his own country for the rest of his life This Mr Placid is Sir Robert Ramble  Sir  ROBERT  to Mr  Placid  Sir I shall be happy in your acquaintance and I assure you if you will do me the honour to meet me now and then at this house you will find every thing very pleasant I verily believe that since I lost my wife which is now about five months ago I verily believe I have dined here three days out of the seven  PLACID  Have you lost your wife Sir And so lately  Sir  ROBERT  with great indifference  Yes Sir about five months agoIs it not Mr Solus You keep account of such things better than I do  SOLUS  Oh ask me no questions about your wife Sir Robert if she had been mine I would have had her to this moment  PLACID  What wrested her from the gripe of death  Sir  ROBERT  No Sir only from the gripe of the Scotch lawyers  SOLUS  More shame for you Shame to wish to be divorced from a virtuous wife  PLACID  Was that the case Divorced from a virtuous wife I never heard of such a circumstance before Pray Sir Robert  very anxiously  will you indulge me by letting me know in what manner you were able to bring about so great an event  Sir  ROBERT  It may appear strange to you Sir but my wife and I did not live happy together  PLACID  Not at all strange Sir I can conceiveI can conceive very well  SOLUS  Yes he can conceive that part to a nicety  Sir  ROBERT  And so I was determined on a divorce  PLACID  But then her character could not be unimpeached  Sir  ROBERT  Yes it was Sir You must know we were married in Scotland and by the laws there a wife can divorce her  husband  for breach of fidelity and so though my wife's character was unimpeached mine was not and she divorced me  PLACID  And is this the law in Scotland  Sir  ROBERT  It is Blessed blessed country that will bind young people together before the years of discretionand as soon as they have discretion to repent will unbind them again  PLACID  I wish I had been married in Scotland  SOLUS  But Sir Robert with all this boasting you must own that your divorce has greatly diminished your fortune  Sir  ROBERT  taking  Solus  aside  Mr Solus you have frequently hinted at my fortune being impaired but I do not approve of such notions being received abroad  SOLUS  I beg your pardon but every body knows that you have played very deep lately and have been a great loser and every body knows  Sir  ROBERT  No Sir every body does not know it for I contradict the report wherever I go A man of fashion does not like to be reckoned poor no more than he likes to be reckoned unhappy We none of us endeavour to  be  happy Sir but merely to be  thought  so and for my part I had rather be in a state of misery and envied for my supposed happiness than in a state of happiness and pitied for my supposed misery  SOLUS  But consider these misfortunes which I have just hinted at are not of any serious nature only such as a few years oeconomy  Sir  ROBERT  But were my wife and her guardian to become acquainted with these little misfortunes they would triumph in my embarrassments  SOLUS  Lady Ramble triumph  They join Mr  Placid  She who was so firmly attached to you that I believe nothing but a compliance with your repeated request to be separated caused her to take the step she did  Sir  ROBERT  Yes I believe she did it to oblige me and I am very much obliged to her  SOLUS  As good a woman Mr Placid  Sir  ROBERT  Very goodbut very ugly  SOLUS  She is beautiful  Sir  ROBERT  to  Solus  I tell you Sir she is hideous And then she was grown so insufferably peevish  SOLUS  I never saw her out of temper  Sir  ROBERT  Mr Solus it is very uncivil of you to praise her before my face Lady Ramble at the time I parted with her had every possible fault both of mind and person and so I made love to other women in her presence told her bluntly that I was tired of her that  I was very sorry to make her uneasy but that I could not love her any longer  And was not that frank and open  SOLUS  Oh that I had but such a wife as she was  Sir  ROBERT  I must own I loved her myself when she was young  SOLUS  Do you call her old  Sir  ROBERT  In years I am certainly older than she but the difference of sex makes her a great deal older than I am For instance Mr Solus you have often lamented not being married in your youth but if you had what would you have now done with an old wife a woman of your own age  SOLUS  Loved and cherished her  Sir  ROBERT  What in spite of her loss of beauty  SOLUS  When she had lost her beauty most likely I should have lost my eyesight and have been blind to the wane of her charms  PLACID  anxiously  But Sir Robert you were explaining to me Mr Solus give me leave to speak to Sir Robert I feel myself particularly interested on this subjectAnd Sir you were explaining to me  Sir  ROBERT  Very true Where did I leave off Oh at my ill usage of my Lady Ramble Yes I did use her very ill and yet she loved me Many a time when she has said to me "Sir Robert I detest your principles your manners and even your person" often at that very instant I have seen a little sparkle of a wish peep out of the corner of one eye that has called to me "Oh Sir Robert how I long to make it up with you"  SOLUS  to Mr  Placid  Do not you wish that your wife had such a little sparkle at the corner of one of her eyes  Sir  Robert  to Mr  Placid  Sir do you wish to be divorced  PLACID  I have no such prospect Mrs Placid is faithful and I was married in England  Sir  ROBERT  But if you have an unconquerable desire to part a separate maintenance will answer nearly the same endfor if your Lady and you will only lay down the plan of separation and agree  PLACID  But unfortunately we never do agree  Sir  ROBERT  Then speak of parting as a thing you dread worse than death and make it your daily prayer to her that she will never think of going from youShe will determine upon it directly  PLACID  I thank you I'm very much obliged to you I thank you a thousand times  Sir  ROBERT  Yes I have studied the art of teasing a wife and there is nothing vexes her so much as laughing at her Can you laugh Mr Placid  PLACID  I don't know whether I can I have not laughed since I marriedBut I thank you Sir for your instructionsI sincerely thank you  SOLUS  And now Sir Robert you have had the good nature to teach this Gentleman how to get rid of his wife will you have the kindness to teach me how to procure one  Enter Mr  IRWIN  Sir  ROBERT  Hah Sure I know that Gentleman's face  SOLUS  My Nephew Let me escape his solicitations  Aside  Here waiter  Exit  PLACID  Irwin  Starting  Having sent him a denial I am ashamed to see him  Aside  Here Mr Solus  Exit following Mr  SOLUS  IRWIN  aside  More cool faces My necessitous countenance clears even a clubroom  Sir  ROBERT  My dear Captain Irwin is it you Yes 'faith it isAfter a nine years' absence I most sincerely rejoice to see you  IRWIN  Sir Robert you shake hands with a cordiality I have not experienced these many days and I thank you  Sir  ROBERT  But what's the matter You seem to droop Where have you left your usual spirits Has absence from your country changed your manners  IRWIN  No Sir but I find some of my countrymen changed I fancy them less warm less friendly than they were and it is that which perhaps has this effect upon me  Sir  ROBERT  Am I changed  IRWIN  You appear an exception  Sir  ROBERT  And I assure you that instead of being grown more gloomy I am even more gay than I was seven years ago for then I was upon the point of matrimonybut now I am just relieved from its cares  IRWIN  I have heard as much But I hope you have not taken so great an aversion to the marriagestate as never to marry again  Sir  ROBERT  Perhaps not But then it must be to some rich heiress  IRWIN  You are right to pay respect to fortune Money is a necessary article in the marriage contract  Sir  ROBERT  As to thatthat would be no great object at present No thank Heaven my estates are pretty large I have no children I have a rich Uncle excellent health admirable spirits and thus happy it would be very strange if I did not meet my old friends with those smiles which never for a moment quit my countenance  IRWIN  In the dispensation of the gifts of Providence how few are found blest like you  Sighing  Sir  ROBERT  And I allure you my dear Mr Irwin it gives me the most serious reflections and the most sincere concern that they are not  IRWIN  I thank you Sir most heartily I thank you for mankind in general and for myself in particular For after this generous unaffected declaration with less scruple than I should to any man in the world I will own to you that I am at this very time in the utmost want of an act of friendship  Sir  ROBERT  aside  And so am INow must I confess myself a poor man or pass for an unfeeling one and I will choose the latter  Bowing with great ceremony and coldness  Any thing that I can command is at your service  IRWIN  Confounded and hesitating  Why then Sir RobertI am almost ashamed to say itbut circumstances have been rather unfavourableMy wife's father  affecting to smile  is not reconciled to us yetMy regiment is broke My Uncle will not part with a farthingLady Eleanor my wife  wipes his eyes  has been supported as yet with some little degree of tenderness elegance andin short I owe a small sum which I am afraid of being troubled for I want a trifle also for our immediate use and if you would lend me a hundred poundsthough upon my honour I am not in a situation to fix the exact time when I can pay it  Sir  ROBERT  My dear Sir never trouble yourself about the time of paying it because it happens not to be in my power to lend it you  IRWIN  Not in your power I beg your pardon but have not you this moment been saying you are rich  Sir  ROBERT  And is it not very common to be rich without money Are not half the town rich And yet half the town has no money I speak for this end of the town the West end The Squares for instance part of Piccadilly down St James'sstreet and so home by Pall Mall We have all estates bonds drafts and notes of hand without number but as for money we have no such thing belonging to us  IRWIN  I sincerely beg your pardon And be assured Sir nothing should have induced me to have taken  the liberty I have done but the necessities of my unhappy family and having understood by your own words that you were in affluence  Sir  ROBERT  I  am  in affluence I am I am but not in so much perhaps as my hasty inconsiderate account may have given you reason to believe I forgot to mention several heavy incumbrances which you will perceive are great drawbacks on my fortuneAs my wife sued for the divorce I have her fortune to return I have also two sisters to portion offa circumstance I totally forgot But my good friend though I am not in circumstances to do what you require I will do something that shall be better I'll wait upon your fatherinlaw Lord Norland and entreat him to forgive his daughter and I am sure he will if I ask him  IRWIN  Impossible  Sir  ROBERT  And so it is now I recollect for he is no other than the guardian of my late wife and a request from me will be received worse than from any other person However Mr Irwin depend upon it that whenever I have an opportunity of serving you I will And whenever you shall do me the favour to call upon me I shall be heartily glad to see you If I am not at home you can leave your card which you know is all the same and depend upon it I shall be extremely glad to see you or that at any time  Exit  IRWIN  Is this my native country Is this the hospitable land which we describe to strangers NoWe are savages to each other nay worseThe savage  makes his fellowsavage welcome divides with him his homely fare gives him the best apartment his hut affords and tries to hush those griefs that are confided in his bosomWhile in this civilized city among my own countrymen even among my brother officers in the army and many of my nearest relations so very civilized they are I could not take the liberty to enter under one roof without a ceremonious invitation and that they will not give me I may leave my card at their door but as for me or any one of mine they would not give us a dinner unless indeed it was in such a style that we might behold with admiration their grandeur and return still more depressed to our own povertyCan I bear this treatment longer No not even for you my Eleanor And this  takes out a pistol  shall now be the only friend to whom I will applyAnd yet I want the courage to be a villain  Enter Mr  HARMONY  speaking as he enters  Irwin  conceals the pistol instantly  HARMONY  Let me see half a dozen newspapersEvery paper of the day  Enter  WAITER  WAITER  That is about three dozen Sir  HARMONY  Get a couple of porters and bring them all  He sits down they bring him papers and he reads  Irwin  starts sits down leans his head on one of the tables and shews various signs of uneasiness then comes forward  IRWIN  Am I a man a soldierAnd a coward Yes  I run away I turn my back on lifeI forsake the post which my commander Providence has allotted me and fly before a banditti of rude misfortunes Rally me love connubial and parental love rally me back to the charge No those very affections sound the retreat  Sits down with the same emotions of distraction as before  HARMONY  That gentleman does not seem happy I wish I had an opportunity of speaking to him  Aside  IRWIN  comes forward and speaks again  But Oh my wife what will be your sufferings when I am brought home to your wretched habitationAnd by my own hand  HARMONY  I am afraid Sir I engross all the news here  Holding up the papers  IRWIN  still apart  Poor soul how her heart will be torn  HARMONY  after looking steadfastly on him  Captain Irwin till this moment I had not the pleasure of recollecting you It is Mr Irwin is it not  IRWIN  His mind deranged by his misfortunes  Yes Sir But what have you to say to him more than to a stranger  HARMONY  Nothing more Sir than to apologize to you for having addressed you just now in so familiar a manner before I knew who you were and to assure you that although I have no other knowledge of you than from report and having been once I believe in your company at this very  house before you left England yet any services of mine as far as my abilities can reach you may freely command  IRWIN  Pray Sir do you live at the West end of the town  HARMONY  I do  IRWIN  Then Sir your services can be of no use to me  HARMONY  Here is the place where I live here is my card  Gives it to him  IRWIN  And here is mine And now I presume we have exchanged every act of friendship which the strict forms of etiquette in this town will admit of  HARMONY  By no means Sir I assure you my professions never go beyond my intentions and if there is any thing that I can serve you in  IRWIN  Have you no sisters to portion off no lady's fortune to return Or perhaps you will speak to my wife's father and entreat him to forgive his child  HARMONY  On that subject you may command me for I have the honour to be intimately acquainted with Lord Norland  IRWIN  But is there no reason you may recollect "why you would be the most unfit person in the world to apply to him"  HARMONY  None I have been honoured with marks of his friendship for many years past and I do not know any one who could with less hazard of his resentment venture to name his daughter to him  IRWIN  Well Sir if you should see him two or three days hence when I am set out on a journey I am going if you will then say a kind word to him for my wife and children I'll thank you  HARMONY  I will go to him instantly  Going  IRWIN  No do not see him yet stay till I am gone He will do nothing till I am gone  HARMONY  May I ask where you are going  IRWIN  No very tedious journey but it is a country to those who go without a proper passport always fatal  HARMONY  I'll see Lord Norland tonight perhaps I may persuade him to prevent your journey I'll see him tonight or early in the morning depend upon itI am a man of my word Sir though I must own I do live at the West end of the town  Exit  IRWIN  'Sdeath am I become the ridicule of my fellowcreatures or am I not in my sensesI know this is Londonthis house a tavernI know I have a wife Oh 'twere better to be mad than to remember her She has a fatherhe is rich and proudthat I will not forget But I will pass his house and send a malediction as I pass it  furiously    No breathe out my last sigh at his inhospitable door and that sigh shall breatheforgiveness  Exit  SCENE II  The Lodgings of Mr  IRWIN  Enter Mrs  PLACID  followed by Lady  ELEANOR IRWIN  Lady  ELEANOR  I am ashamed of the trouble I have given you Mrs Placid It had been sufficient to have sent me home in your carriage to attend me yourself was ceremonious  Mrs  PLACID  My dear Lady Eleanor I was resolved to come home with you as soon as Mr Placid desired I would not  Lady  ELEANOR  Was that the cause of your politeness I am sorry it should  Mrs  PLACID  Why sorry It is not proper he should have his way in every thing  Lady  ELEANOR  But I am afraid you seldom let him have it at all  Mrs  PLACID  Yes I doBut where my dear is Mr Irwin  Lady  ELEANOR  weeping  I cannot hear the name of Mr Irwin without shedding tears his health has been so much impaired of late and his spirits so badsometimes I even fear for a failure in his mind  Weeps again  Mrs  PLACID  Is not he at home  Lady  ELEANOR  I hope he is  Goes to the side of the scenes  Tell your master Mrs Placid is here  Enter  SERVANT  SERVANT  My master is not come in yet Madam  Lady  ELEANOR  Not yet I am very sorry for itvery sorry indeed  Mrs  PLACID  Bless me my dear don't look thus pale Come sit down and I'll stay with you till he returns  Sits down herself  Lady  ELEANOR  My dear you forget that Mr Placid is in the carriage at the door all this time  Mrs  PLACID  No I don't Come let us sit and have half an hour's conversation  Lady  ELEANOR  Nay I insist upon your going to him or desiring him to walk in  Mrs  PLACID  Now I think of it they may as well drive him home and come back for me  Enter Mr  PLACID  Why surely Mr Placid you were very impatient I think you might have waited a few minutes longer  PLACID  I would have waited my dear but the evening is so damp  Lady  ELEANOR  Ah 'tis the evening which makes me alarmed for Mr Irwin  PLACID  Lady Eleanor you are one of the most tender anxious and affectionate wives I ever knew  Mrs  PLACID  There Now he wishes he was your husband He admires the conduct of every wife but his own and envies every married man of his acquaintance But it is very ungenerous of you  PLACID  So it is my dear and not at all consistent with the law of retaliation for I am sure there is not one of my acquaintance who envies me  Mrs  PLACID  Mr Placid your behaviour throughout this whole day has been so totally different to what it ever was before that I am half resolved to live no longer with you  PLACID  aside  It will doIt will do  Lady  ELEANOR  Oh my dear friends do not talk of parting how can you while every blessing smiles on your union Even I who have reason to regret mine yet while that load of grief a separation from Mr Irwin is but averted I will think every other affliction supportable  A loud rapping at the door  That is he  Mrs  PLACID  Why you seem in raptures at his return  Lady  ELEANOR  I know no greater rapture  Enter  IRWIN  pale trembling and disordered  Lady  ELEANOR  My dear you are not well I see  IRWIN  Yes  Aside to her in anger  Why do you speak of it  PLACID  How do you do Irwin  IRWIN  I am glad to see you  Bows  Mrs  PLACID  But I am sorry to see you look so ill  IRWIN  I have only been taking a glass too much  Lady  Eleanor  weeps  PLACID  Pshaw Don't I know you never drink  IRWIN  You are mistaken I do when my wife is not by I am afraid of her  PLACID  Impossible  IRWIN  What To be afraid of one's wife  PLACID  No I think that very possible  Mrs  PLACID  But it does not look well when it is so it makes a man appear contemptible and a woman a termagant Come Mr Placid I cannot stay another moment Good night Heaven bless you  To Lady  Eleanor  Good night my dear Mr Irwin  and now pray take my advice and keep up your spirits  IRWIN  I will Madam  Shaking hands with  Placid  And do you keep up your spirits  Exeunt Mr and Mrs  Placid  Irwin  shuts the door with care after them and looks round the room as if he feared to be seen or overheard  I am glad they are gone I spoke unkindly to you just now did I not My temper is altered lately and yet I love you  Lady  ELEANOR  I never doubted it nor ever will  IRWIN  If you did you would wrong me for there is not a danger I would not risk for your sake there is not an infamy I would not be branded with to make you happy nor a punishment I would not undergo with joy for your welfareBut there is a bar to this we are unfortunately so entwined together so linked so rivetted so cruelly painfully fettered to each other you could not be happy unless I shared the self same happiness with you But you will learn betternow you are in London and amongst fashionable wives you must learn better  Walks about and smiles with a ghastly countenance  Lady  ELEANOR  Do not talk do not look thus wildlyIndeed indeed you make me very uneasy  IRWIN  What uneasy when I come to bring you comfort and such comfort as you have not experienced  for many a day  He pulls out a pocketbook  Here is a friend in our necessitya friend that brings a thousand friends plenty andno not always peace  He takes several papers from the book and puts them into her handsShe looks at them then screams  Lady  ELEANOR  Ah 'Tis money  Trembling  These are Bank notes  IRWIN  Hush For heaven's sake hush We shall be discovered  Trembling and in great perturbation  What alarms you thus  Lady  ELEANOR  What alarms you  IRWIN  Do you say I am frightened  Lady  ELEANOR  A sight so new has frightened me  IRWIN  Nay they are your own by heaven they are No one on earth has a better or a fairer right than you have It was a laudable act by which I obtained themThe parentbird had forsook its young and I but forced it back to perform the rites of nature  Lady  ELEANOR  You are insane I fear No no I do not  fear hope  you are  A loud rapping at the streetdoorHe starts takes the notes from her and puts them hastily into his pocket  IRWIN  Go to the door yourself and if 'tis any one who asks for me say I am not come home yet  She goes out then returns  Lady  ELEANOR  It is the person belonging to the house no one to us  IRWIN  My dear Eleanor are you willing to quit London with me in about two hours time  Lady  ELEANOR  Instantly  IRWIN  Nay not only London but England  Lady  ELEANOR  This world if you desire it To go in company with you will make the journey pleasant and all I loved on earth would still be with me  IRWIN  You can then leave your father without regret  never never  to see him more  Lady  ELEANOR  Why should I think on him who will not think of me  Weeps  IRWIN  But our children  Lady  ELEANOR  We are not to leave them behind  IRWIN  One of them we must but do not let that give you uneasiness You know he has never lived with us since his infancy and cannot pine for the loss of parents whom he has never known  Lady  ELEANOR  But I have  known him  He was my first and sometimes I think more closely wound around my heart than all the rest The grief I felt on being forced to leave him when we went  abroad and the constant anxiety I have since experienced lest he should not be kindly treated have augmented I think my tenderness  IRWIN  All my endeavours today as well as every other day have been in vain to find into what part of the country his nurse has taken himNay be not thus overcome with tears we will in spite of all my haste to be gone stay one more miserable day here in hopes to procure intelligence so as to take him with us and then smile with contempt on all we leave behind  Exeunt  END OF THE SECOND ACT  ACT III  SCENE I  A Library at Lord  NORLAND's  Enter Lord  NORLAND  followed by Mr  HARMONY  Lord  NORLAND  in anger  I TELL you Mr Harmony that if an indifferent person one on whom I had never bestowed a favour in my life were to offend me it is in my nature never to forgive Can I then forgive my own daughter my only child on whom I heaped continually marks of the most affectionate fondness Shall she dare to offend me in the tenderest point and you dare to suppose I will pardon her  HARMONY  Your child consider  Lord  NORLAND  The weakest argument you can use As my child was not she most bound to obey me As my child ought she not to have sacrificed her own happiness to mine Instead of which mine has been yielded up for a whim a fancy a fancy to marry a beggar and as such is her choice let her beg with him  HARMONY  She does by mepleads hard for your forgiveness  Lord  NORLAND  If I thought she dared to send a message to me though dictated on her knees she should find  that she had not yet felt the full force of my resentment  HARMONY  What could you do more  Lord  NORLAND  I have done nothing yet At present I have only abandoned herbut I can persecute  HARMONY  I have no doubt of it and that I may not be the means of aggravating your displeasure I assure you that what I have now said has been entirely from myself without any desire of hers and at the same time I give you my promise I will never presume to intrude the subject again  Lord  NORLAND  On this condition but on no other I forgive you now  HARMONY  And now then my Lord let us pass from those who have forfeited your love to those who possess itI heard some time ago but I never presumed to mention it to you that you had adopted a young man as your son  Lord  NORLAND  "A young man" PshawNo a boya mere child who fell in my way by accident  HARMONY  A chance child Ho hoI understand you  Lord  NORLAND  Do not jest with me Sir Do I look  HARMONY  Yes you look as if you would be ashamed to own it if you had one  Lord  NORLAND  But this boy I am not ashamed ofhe is a favouriterather a favouriteI did not like him so well at firstbut customand having a poor creature entirely at one's mercy one begins to love it merely from the idea ofWhat would be its fate if one did not  HARMONY  Is he an orphan then  Lord  NORLAND  No  HARMONY  You have a friendship for his parents  Lord  NORLAND  I never saw the father his mother I had a friendship for once  Sighing  HARMONY  Ay while the husband was away  Lord  NORLAND  I tell you no  violently  But ask no more questions Who his parents are is a secret which neither he nor any one that is now living knows except myself nor ever shall  HARMONY  Well my Lord since 'tis your pleasure to consider him as your child I sincerely with you may experience more duty from him than you have done from your daughter  Lord  NORLAND  Thank Heaven his disposition is not in the least like her'sNo  very much impassioned  I have the joy to say that never child was so unlike its mother  HARMONY  starting  How His mother  Lord  NORLAND  Confusionwhat have I saidI am ashamed  HARMONY  Nobe proud  Lord  NORLAND  Of what  HARMONY  That you have a lawful heir to all your riches proud that you have a grandson  Lord  NORLAND  I would have concealed it from all the world I wished it even unknown to myself And let me tell you Sir as not by my design but through my inadvertency you are become acquainted with this secret that if ever you breathe it to a single creature the boy shall answer for it for were he known to be her's though he were dearer to me than ever  she  was I would turn him from my house and cast him from my heart as I have done her  HARMONY  I believe youand in compassion to the child give you my  solemn promise  never to reveal who he is I have heard that those unfortunate parents left an infant behind when they went abroad and that they now lament him as lost Will you satisfy my curiosity in what manner you sought and found him out  Lord  NORLAND  Do you suppose I searched for him Nohe was forced upon me A woman followed me about eight years ago in the fields adjoining to  my country seat with a halfstarved boy in her hand and asked my charity for my grandchild the impression of the word made me turn round involuntarily and casting my eyes upon him I was rejoiced not to find a feature of his mother's in all his face and I began to feel something like pity for him In short he caught such fast hold by one of my fingers that I asked him carelessly "if he would go home and live with me" On which he answered me so willingly "Yes" I took him at his word  HARMONY  And did never your regard for him plead in his mother's behalf  Lord  NORLAND  Never For by Heaven I would as soon forgive the robber who met me last night at my own door and holding a pistol to my breast took from me a sum to a considerable amount as I would pardon her  HARMONY  Did such an accident happen to you  Lord  NORLAND  Have you not heard of it  HARMONY  No  Lord  NORLAND  It is amazing we cannot put a stop to such depredations  HARMONY  Provisions are so scarce  Enter  SERVANT  SERVANT  Miss Wooburn my Lord if you are not engaged will come and sit an hour with you  Lord  NORLAND  I have no company but what she is perfectly acquainted with and shall be glad of her visit  Exit Servant  HARMONY  You forget I am a stranger and my presence may not be welcome  Lord  NORLAND  A stranger What to my ward to Lady Ramble for that is the name which custom would authorise her to keep but such courtesy she disdains in contempt of the unworthy giver of the title  HARMONY  I am intimate with Sir Robert my Lord and though I acknowledge that both you and his lady have cause for complaint yet Sir Robert has still many virtues  Lord  NORLAND  Not one He is the most vile the most detestable of characters He not only contradicted my will in the whole of his conduct but he seldom met me that he did not give me some personal affront  HARMONY  It is however generally held better to be uncivil in a person's presence than in his absence  Lord  NORLAND  He was uncivil to me in every respect  HARMONY  That I will deny for I have heard Sir Robert in your absence say such things in your praise  Lord  NORLAND  Indeed  HARMONY  Most assuredly  Lord  NORLAND  I wish he had sometimes done me the honour to have spoken politely to my face  HARMONY  That is not Sir Robert's wayhe is no flatterer But then no sooner has your back been turned than I have heard him lavish in your praise  Lord  NORLAND  I must own Mr Harmony that I never looked upon Sir Robert as incorrigible I could always discern a ray of understanding and a beam of virtue through all his foibles nor would I have urged the divorce but that I found his wife's sensibility could not bear his neglect and even now notwithstanding her endeavour to conceal it she pines in secret and laments her hard fortune All my hopes of restoring her health rest on one prospectthat of finding a man worthy my recommendation for her second husband and by creating a second passion expel the firstMr Harmony you and I have been long acquaintedI have known your disposition from your infancy Now if such a man as you were to offer  HARMONY  You flatter me  Lord  NORLAND  I do notWould you venture to become her husband  HARMONY  I cannot say I have any particular desire but if it will oblige either you or herfor my part I think the short time we live in this world we should do all we can to oblige each other  Lord  NORLAND  I should rejoice at such an union myself and I  think I can answer for herYou permit me then to make overtures to her in your name  HARMONY  considering  This is rather a serious piece of business However I never did make a difficulty when I wished to oblige a friendBut there is one proviso my Lord I must first mention it to Sir Robert  Lord  NORLAND  Why so  HARMONY  Because he and I have always been very intimate friends and to marry his wife without even telling him of it will appear very uncivil  Lord  NORLAND  Do you mean then to ask his consent  HARMONY  Not absolutely his consent but I will insinuate the subject to him and obtain his approbation in a manner suitable to my own satisfaction  Lord  NORLAND  You will oblige me then if you will see him as early as possible for it is reported he is going abroad  HARMONY  I will go to him immediatelyand my Lord I will do all in my power to oblige you Sir Robert and the Lady  aside  but as to obliging myself that was never one of my considerations  Exit  Enter Miss  WOOBURN  Lord  NORLAND  I am sorry to see you thus you have been weeping Will you still lament your separation from a  cruel husband as if you had followed a kind one to the grave  Miss  WOOBURN  By no means my Lord Tears from our sex are not always the result of grief they are frequently no more than little sympathetic tributes which we pay to our fellowbeings while the mind and the heart are steeled against the weakness which our eyes indicate  Lord  NORLAND  Can you say your mind and heart are so steeled  Miss  WOOBURN  I can My mind is as firmly fixed against Sir Robert Ramble as at our first acquaintance it was fixed upon him And I solemnly protest  Lord  NORLAND  To a man of my age and observation protestations are vainGive me a proof that you have rooted him from your heart  Miss  WOOBURN  Any proof you require I will give without a moment's hesitation  Lord  NORLAND  I take you at your word and desire you to accept a Gentleman whom I shall recommend for your second husband  Miss  Wooburn  starts  You said you would not hesitate a moment  Miss  WOOBURN  I thought I should notbut this is something so unexpected  Lord  NORLAND  You break your word then and still give cause for this ungrateful man to ridicule your fondness for him  Miss  WOOBURN  No I will put an end to that humiliation and whoever the Gentleman is whom you mean to proposeYet do not name him at presentbut give me the satisfaction of keeping the promise I have made to you at least for a little time without exactly knowing how far it extends for in return I have a promise to ask from you before I acquaint you with the nature of your engagement  Lord  NORLAND  I give my promise Now name your request  Miss  WOOBURN  Then my Lord  hesitating and confused  the law gave me back upon my divorce from Sir Robert the very large fortune which I brought to himI am afraid that in his present circumstances to enforce the strict payment of this debt would very much embarrass him  Lord  NORLAND  What if it did  Miss  WOOBURN  It is my entreaty to you in whose hands is invested the power to demand this right of law to lay my claim aside for the present  Lord  Norland  offers to speak  I know my Lord what you are going to say I know Sir Robert is not  now  but I can never forget that he  has been  my husband  Lord  NORLAND  To shew my gratitude for your compliance with the request I have just made you  Goes to a table in the library  here is the bond by which I am impowered to seize on the greatest part of his estates in right of you take the bond into your own possession till your next husband demands it  of you and by the time you have called him husband for a few weeks this tenderness or delicacy to Sir Robert will be worn away  Enter  HARMONY  hastily  HARMONY  My Lord I beg pardon but I forgot to mention  Miss  WOOBURN  Oh Mr Harmony I have not seen you before I know not when I am particularly happy at your calling just now for I have  hesitating  a little favour to ask of you  HARMONY  If it were a great favour Madam you might command me  Miss  WOOBURN  Butmy Lord I beg your pardonbut the favour I have to ask of Mr Harmony must be told to him in private  Lord  NORLAND  Oh I am sure I have not the least objection to you and Mr Harmony having a private conference I'll leave you together  Harmony  appears embarrassed  You do not derange my business I'll be back in a short time  Exit  Miss  WOOBURN  Mr Harmony you are the very man on earth I most wanted to see  Harmony  bows  I know the kindness of your heart the liberality of your sentiments and I wish to repose a charge to your trust very near to me indeedbut you must be secret  HARMONY  When a Lady reposes a trust in me I should not be a man if I were not  Miss  WOOBURN  I must first inform you that Lord Norland has just drawn from me a promise that I will once more enter into the marriagestate and without knowing to whom he intends to give me I will keep my promiseBut it is in vain to say that though I mean all duty and fidelity to my second husband I shall not experience moments when my thoughtswill wander on my first  HARMONY  starting  HemHem  To her  Indeed  Miss  WOOBURN  I must always rejoice in Sir Robert's successes and lament over his misfortunes  HARMONY  If that is all  Miss  WOOBURN  No I would go one step further  Harmony  starts again  I would secure him from those misfortunes which to hear of will disturb my peace of mind I know his fortune has suffered very much and I cannot  will not  place it in the power of the man whom my Lord Norland may point out for my next marriage to distress him farther This is the writing by which that Gentleman may claim the part of my fortune from Sir Robert Ramble which is in landed property carry it my dear Mr Harmony to Sir Robert instantly and tell him that in separating from him I meant only to give him liberty not make him the debtor perhaps the prisoner of my future husband  HARMONY  Madam I will most undoubtedly take this bond to my friend but will you give me leave to suggest to you that the person on whom you bestow your hand may be a little surprised to find that while he is in possession of you Sir Robert is in the possession of your fortune  Miss  WOOBURN  Do not imagine Sir that I shall marry any man without first declaring what I have doneI only wish at present it should be concealed from Lord NorlandWhen this paper is given as I have required it cannot be recalled and when that is past I shall divulge my conduct to whom I please and first of all to him who shall offer me his addresses  HARMONY  And if he is a man of my feelings his addresses will be doubly importunate for this proof of liberality to your former husband But are you sure that in the return of this bond there is no secret affection no latent spark of love  Miss  WOOBURN  None I know my heart and if there was I could not ask you Mr Harmony nor any one like you to be the messenger of an imprudent passion Sir Robert's vanity I know may cause him to judge otherwise but undeceive him let him know this is a sacrifice to the golden principles of duty and not an offering to the tinselled shrine of love  Enter Lord  NORLAND  Put up the bond  Harmony  conceals it  Lord  NORLAND  Well my dear have you made your request  Miss  WOOBURN  Yes my Lord  Lord  NORLAND  And has he granted it  HARMONY  Yes my Lord I am going to grant it  Lord  NORLAND  I sincerely wish you both joy of this good understanding between you But Mr Harmony  in a whisper  are not you going to Sir Robert  HARMONY  Yes my Lord I am going this moment  Lord  NORLAND  Make haste then and do not forget your errand  HARMONY  No my Lord I sha'n't forget my errand it won't slip my memoryGood morning my Lord good morning Madam  Exit  Lord  NORLAND  Now my dear as you and Mr Harmony seem to be on such excellent terms I think I may venture to tell you if he has not yet told you himself that he is the man who is to be your husband  Miss  WOOBURN  He Mr HarmonyNo my Lord he has not told me and I am confident he never will  Lord  NORLAND  What makes you think so  Miss  WOOBURN  Becausebecausehe must be sensible he would not be the man I should choose  Lord  NORLAND  And where is the woman who marries the man she would choose You are reversing the order of society men only have the right of choice in marriage Were women permitted theirs we should have handsome beggars allied to our noblest families and no such object in our whole island as an old maid  Miss  WOOBURN  But being denied that choice why forbid to remain as I am  Lord  NORLAND  What are you now Neither a widow a maid nor a wife If I could fix a term to your present state I should not be thus anxious to place you in another  Miss WOOBURN  I am perfectly acquainted with your friendly motives and feel the full force of your advice I therefore renew my promiseand although Mr Harmony in respect to the marriage state is as little to my wishes as any man on earth I will nevertheless endeavourwhatever struggles it may cost meto be to him if he prefers his suit a dutiful an obedientbut for a loving wife that I can never be again  Exeunt severally  SCENE  An Apartment at Sir  RORBERT RAMBLE's  Enter Sir  ROBERT  and Mr  HARMONY  Sir  ROBERT  I thank you for this visit I was undetermined what to do with myself Your company has determined me to stay at home  HARMONY  I was with a Gentleman just now Sir Robert and you were the subject of our conversation  Sir  ROBERT  Had it been a Lady I should be anxious to know what she said  HARMONY  I have been with a Lady likewise and she made you the subject of her discourse  Sir  ROBERT  But was she handsome  HARMONY  Very handsome  Sir  ROBERT  My dear fellow what is her name What did she say and where may I meet with her  HARMONY  Her name is Wooburn  Sir  ROBERT  That is the name of my late wife  HARMONY  It is her I mean  Sir  ROBERT  Zounds you had just put my spirits into a flame and now you throw cold water all over me  HARMONY  I am sorry to hear you say so for I came from her this moment and what do you think is the present she has given me to deliver to you  Sir  ROBERT  Pshaw I want no presents Some of my old loveletters returned I suppose to remind me of my inconstancy  HARMONY  Do not undervalue her generosity this is her presentthis bond which has power to take from you three thousand a year her right  Sir  ROBERT  Ah this is a present indeed Are you sure you speak truth Let me look at itSure my eyes deceive meNo by Heaven it is true  Reads  The very thing I wanted and will make me perfectly happy Now I'll be generous again my bills shall be paid my gaming debts cancelled poor Irwin shall find a friend and I'll send her as pretty a copy of verses as ever I wrote in my life  HARMONY  Take care how you treat with levity a woman of her elevated mind She charged me to assure you "that love had no share whatever in this act but merely compassion to the embarrassed state of your affairs"  Sir  ROBERT  Sir I would have you to know I am no object of compassion However a Lady's favour one cannot return and so I'll keep this thing  Puts it in his pocket  HARMONY  Nay if your circumstances are different from what she imagines give it me back and I will return it to her  Sir  ROBERT  No poor thing it would break her heart to send it backNo I'll keep itShe would never forgive me were I to send it back I'll keep it And she is welcome to attribute her concern for me to what she pleases But surely you can see you can understandBut Heaven bless her for  her love and I would love her in returnif I could  HARMONY  You would not talk thus if you had seen the firm dignity with which she gave me that paper "Assure him" said she "no remaining affection comes along with it but merely a duty which I owe him to protect him from the humiliation of being a debtor to the man whom I am going to marry"  Sir  ROBERT  With the utmost emotion  Why she is not going to be married again  HARMONY  I believe so  Sir  ROBERT  But are you sure of it Sir Are you sure of it  HARMONY  Both she and her guardian told me so  Sir  ROBERT  That guardian my Lord Norland is one of the basest vilest of menI tell you what Sir I'll resent this usage  HARMONY  WhereforeAs to his being the means of bringing about your separation in that he obliged you  Sir  ROBERT  Yes Sir he did he certainly didbut though I am not the least offended with him on that head for at that I rejoice yet I will resent his disposing of her a second time  HARMONY  And why  Sir  ROBERT  Because little regard as I have for her myself yet no other man shall dare to treat her so ill as I have done  HARMONY  Do not fear itHer next husband will be a man who I can safely say will never insult or even offend her but sooth indulge and make her happy  Sir  ROBERT  And do you dare to tell me that her next husband shall make her happy Now that is worse than the otherNo Sir no man shall ever have it to say "he has made her either happy or miserable" but myself  HARMONY  I know of but one way to prevent it  Sir  ROBERT  And what is that  HARMONY  Pay your addresses to her and marry her again yourself  Sir  ROBERT  And I would rather than she should be happy with any body else The devil take me if I would not  HARMONY  To shew that I am wholly disinterested in this affair I will carry her a letter from you if you like and say all I can in your behalf  Sir  ROBERT  Ha ha ha Now my dear Harmony you carry your goodnatured simplicity too far However I thank you I sincerely thank youBut do you imagine I should be such a blockhead as to make love to the same woman I made love to seven years ago and who for the last six years I totally neglected  HARMONY  Yes for if you neglected her six years she will now be a novelty  Sir  ROBERT  Egad and so she will You are right  HARMONY  But being in possession of her fortune you can be very happy without her  Sir  ROBERT  Take her fortune back Sir  Taking the bond from his pocket and offering it to  Harmony  I would starve I would perish die in poverty and infamy rather than owe an obligation to a vile perfidious inconstant woman  HARMONY  Consider Sir Robert if you insist on my taking this bond back it may fall into the husband's hands  Sir  ROBERT  Take it backI insist upon it  Gives it him and  Harmony  puts it up  But Mr Harmony depend on it Lord Norland shall hear from me in the most serious manner for his interferenceI repeat he is the vilest the most villanous of men  HARMONY  How can you speak with such rancour of a nobleman who speaks of  you  in the highest terms  Sir  ROBERT  Does he 'faith  HARMONY  He owns you have some faults  Sir  ROBERT  I know I have  HARMONY  But he thinks your good qualities are numberless  Sir  ROBERT  Now dam'me if ever I thought so ill of  him  as I have appeared to doBut who is the intended  husband my dear friend Tell me that I may laugh at him and make you laugh at him  HARMONY  No I am not inclined to laugh at him  Sir  ROBERT  Is it old Solus  HARMONY  No  Sir  ROBERT  But I will bet you a wager it is somebody equally ridiculous  HARMONY  I never bet  Sir  ROBERT  Solus is mad for a wife and has been praising mine up to the heavens you need say no more I know it is he  HARMONY  Upon my honour it is not However I cannot disclose to you at present the person's name I must first obtain Lord Norland's permission  Sir  ROBERT  I shall ask you no more I'll write to her she will tell meor I'll pay her a visit and ask her boldly myselfDo you think  anxiously  do you think she would see me  HARMONY  You can but try  Enter  SERVANT  SERVANT  Mr Solus  Sir  ROBERT  Now I will find out the secret immediatelyI'll charge him with being the intended husband  HARMONY  I will not stay to hear you  Enter  SOLUS  Mr Solus how do you do I am extremely sorry that my enagagements take me away as soon as you enter  Exit  Harmony  running to avoid an explanation  SOLUS  Sir Robert what is the matter Has any thing ruffled you Why I never saw you look more out of temper even while you were married  Sir  ROBERT  Ah that I had never married never known what marriage was for even at this moment I feel its torments in my heart  SOLUS  I have often heard of the torments of matrimony but I conceive that at the worst they are nothing more than a kind of violent tickling which will force the tears into your eyes though at the same time you are bursting your sides with laughter  Sir  ROBERT  You have defined marriage too favourably there is no laughter in the state all is melancholy all gloom  SOLUS  Now I think marriage is an excellent remedy for the spleen I have known a Gentleman at a feast receive an affront disguise his rage step home vent it all upon his wife return to his companions and be as good company as if nothing had happened  Sir  ROBERT  But even the necessary expences of a wife should alarm you  SOLUS  I can then retrench some of my own Oh my dear Sir a married man has so many delightful privileges to what a bachelor hasAn old Lady will introduce her daughters to you in a dishabille "It does not signify my dears it's a married man"One Lady will suffer you to draw on her glove"Never mind it's a married man" Another will permit you to pull on her slipper a third will even take you into her bedchamber "Pshaw it's  nothing  but a married man"  Sir  ROBERT  But the weight of your fetters will overbalance all these joys  SOLUS  And I cannot say notwithstanding you are relieved from the bond that I see much joy or brightness here  Sir  ROBERT  I am not very well at present I have the headach and if ever a wife can be of comfort to her husband it must be when he is indisposed A wife then binds up your head mixes your powders bathes your temples and hovers about in a way that is most endearing  SOLUS  Don't speak of it I long to have one hover about me But I willI am determined I will before I am a week older Don't speak don't attempt to persuade me not Your description has renewed my eagernessI will be married  Sir  ROBERT  And without pretending not to know who you mean to make your wife I tell you plainly it is Miss Wooburn it is my late wifeI know you  made overtures to my Lord Norland and that he has given his consent  SOLUS  You tell me a great piece of newsI'll go ask my Lord if it be true and if he says it is I shall be very glad to find it so  Sir  ROBERT  That is right Sir marry her marry herI give you joythat's allHa ha ha I think I should know her temperBut if you will venture to marry her I sincerely wish you happy  SOLUS  And if we are not you know we can be divorced  Sir  ROBERT  Not always Take my advice and live as you are  SOLUS  You almost stagger my resolutionI had painted such bright prospects in marriageGood day to you  Going returns  You think I had better not marry  Sir  ROBERT  You are undone if you do  SOLUS  sighing  You  ought to know from experience  Sir  ROBERT  From that I speak  SOLUS  Going to the door and returning once or twice as unstable in his resolution  But then what a poor disconsolate object shall I live without a wife to hover about me to bind up my head and bathe my temples Oh I am  impatient for all the chartered rights privileges and immunities of a married man  Exit  Sir  ROBERT  Furies racks tormentsI cannot bear what I feel and yet I am ashamed to own I feel any thing  Enter Mr  PLACID  PLACID  My dear Sir Robert give me joy Mrs Placid and I are come to the very point you advised matters are in the fairest way for a separation  Sir  ROBERT  I do give you joy and most sincerelyYou are right you'll soon be as happy as I am  Sighing  But would you suppose it that deluded woman my wife is going to be married again I thought she had had enough of me  PLACID  You are hurt I see lest the world should say she has forgot you  Sir  ROBERT  She cannot forget me I defy her to forget me  PLACID  Who is her intended husband  Sir  ROBERT  Solus Solus An old manan ugly man He left me this moment and owned itowned it Go after him will you and persuade him not to have her  PLACID  My advice will have no effect for you know he is bent upon matrimony  Sir  ROBERT  Then could not you my dear Sir as you are going to be separated could not you recommend him to marry your wifeIt will be all the same to him I dare say and I shall like it much better  PLACID  Ours will not be a divorce consider but merely a separate maintenance But were it otherwise I wish no man so ill as to wish him married to Mrs Placid  Sir  ROBERT  That is my case exactly I wish no man so ill as to wish him married to my Lady Ramble and poor old Solus in particular poor old man a very good sort of manI have a great friendship for SolusI can't stay a moment in the houseI must go somewhereI'll go to SolusNo I'll go to Lord NorlandNo I will go to Harmony and then I'll call on you and we'll take a bottle together and when we are both free  takes his hand  we'll join from that moment we'll join to laugh at to contemn to despise all those who boast of the joys of conjugal love  Exeunt  END OF THE THIRD ACT  ACT IV  SCENE I  An Apartment at Mr  HARMONY's  Enter Mr  HARMONY  HARMONY  AND now for one of the most painful tasks that brotherly love ever draws upon me to tell another the suit of which I gave him hope has failedYet if I can but overcome Captain Irwin's delicacy so far as to prevail on him to accept one proof more of my good wishes towards him but to a man of his nice sense of obligations the offer must be made with caution  Enter Lord  NORLAND  Lord  NORLAND  Mr Harmony I beg your pardon I come in thus abruptly from the anxiety I feel concerning what passed between us this morning in respect to Miss Wooburn You have not changed your mind I hope  HARMONY  Indeed my Lord I am very sorry that it will not be in my power to oblige you  Lord  NORLAND  in anger  How Sir Did not you give me your word  HARMONY  Only conditionally my Lord  Lord  NORLAND  And what were the conditions  HARMONY  Have you forgot them Her former husband  Enter  SERVANT  SERVANT  Sir Robert Ramble is in his carriage at the door and if you are at leisure will come in  HARMONY  Desire him to walk up I have your leave I suppose my Lord  Exit Servant  Lord  NORLAND  Yes but let me get out of the house without meeting him  Going to the opposite door  Can I go this way  HARMONY  Why should you shun him  Lord  NORLAND  Because he used his wife ill  HARMONY  He did But I believe he is very sorry for it And as for you he said to me only a few hours agobut no matter  Lord  NORLAND  What did he say I insist upon knowing  HARMONY  Why then he said "that if he had a sacred trust to repose in any one  you  should be the man on earth to whom he would confide it"  Lord  NORLAND  Well I am in no hurry I can stay a few minutes  Enter Sir  ROBERT RAMBLE  Sir  ROBERT  Oh Harmony I am in such a distracted state  of mind  Seeing Lord  Norland  he starts and bows with the most humble respect  Lord  NORLAND  Sir Robert how do you do  Sir  ROBERT  My Lord I am pretty wellI hope I have the happiness of seeing your Lordship in perfect health  Lord  NORLAND  Very well Sir I thank you  Sir  ROBERT  Indeed my Lord I think I never saw you look better  Lord  NORLAND  Mr Harmony you and Sir Robert may have some businessI'll wish you a good morning  HARMONY  No my Lord I fancy Sir Robert has nothing particular  Sir  ROBERT  Nothing nothing I assure you my Lord  Lord  NORLAND  However I have business myself in another place and so you will excuse me  Going  Sir  ROBERT  following him  My LordLord NorlandI trust you will excuse my enquiriesI hope my Lord all your family are well  Lord  NORLAND  All very well  Sir  ROBERT  Your little ElevèMaster Edwardthe young Gentleman you have adoptedI hope he is  well  hesitating and confused  Andyour Ward SirMiss WooburnI hope my Lord she is well  Lord  NORLAND  Yes Sir Robert Miss Wooburn is tolerably well  Sir  ROBERT  Only tolerably my Lord I am sorry for that  HARMONY  I hope my Lord you will excuse my mentioning the subject but I was telling Sir Robert just now of your intentions respecting a second marriage for that Lady but Sir Robert does not appear to approve of the design  Lord  NORLAND  What objection can  he  have  Sir  ROBERT  My Lord there are such a number of bad husbands there are such a number of dissipated unthinking unprincipled menAndI should be extremely sorry to see any Lady with whom I have had the honour of being so closely allied united to one who would undervalue her worth  Lord  NORLAND  Pray Sir Robert were you not then extremely sorry for her while she was united to you  Sir  ROBERT  Very sorry for her indeed my Lord But at that time my mind was so taken up with other cares I own I did not feel the compassion which was her due but now that I am single I shall have leisure to pay her more attention and should I find her unhappy it must inevitably make me so  Lord  NORLAND  Depend upon it that on the present occasion I shall take infinite care in the choice of her husband  Sir  ROBERT  If your Lordship would permit me to have an interview with Miss Wooburn I think I should be able at least  Lord  NORLAND  You would not sure insult her by your presence  Sir  ROBERT  I think I should be able at least to point out an object worthy of her tasteI know what she will like better than any body in the world  Lord  NORLAND  Her request has been that I may point her out a husband the reverse of you  Sir  ROBERT  Then upon my honour my Lord she won't like him  Lord  NORLAND  Have not you liked women the reverse of her  Sir  ROBERT  Yes my Lord perhaps I have and perhaps I still do I do not pretend to love  her  I did not say I did nay I positively protest I do not but this indifference I acknowledge as one of my faults and notwithstanding all my faults give me leave to acknowledge my gratitude that your Lordship has nevertheless been pleased to declare you think my virtues are numberless  Lord  Norland  shews surprise  HARMONY  aside to Sir  ROBERT  Hush hushDon't talk of your virtues now  Lord  NORLAND  Sir Robert to all this incoherent language this is my answer this is my will The Lady to whom I have had the honour to be guardian shall never while she calls me friend see you more  Sir  ROBERT  at this sentence stands silent for some time then suddenly recollecting himself  Sir  ROBERT  Lord Norland I am too well acquainted with the truth of your word and the firmness of your temper to press my suit one sentence farther  Lord  NORLAND  I commend your discernment  Sir  ROBERT  My Lord I feel myself a little embarrassed I am afraid I have made myself a little ridiculous upon this occasionWill your Lordship do me the favour to forget it  Lord  NORLAND  I will forget whatever you please  HARMONY  following him whispers  I am sorry to see you going away in despair  Sir  ROBERT  I never did despair in my life Sir and while a woman is the object of my wishes I never will  Exit  Lord  NORLAND  What did he say  HARMONY  That he thought your conduct that of a just and an upright man  Lord  NORLAND  To say the truth he has gone away with better  manners than I could have imagined considering his jealousy is provoked  HARMONY  Ah I always knew he loved his wife notwithstanding his behaviour to her for if you remember he always spoke well of her behind her back  Lord  NORLAND  No I do not remember it  HARMONY  Yes he did and that is the only criterion of a man's love or of his friendship  Enter  SERVANT  SERVANT  A young gentleman is at the door Sir enquiring for Lord Norland  Lord  NORLAND  Who can it be  HARMONY  Your young gentleman from home I dare say Desire him to walk in Bring him here  Exit Servant  Lord  NORLAND  What business can he have to follow me  Enter  EDWARD  EDWARD  Oh my Lord I beg your pardon for coming hither but I come to tell you something you will be glad to hear  HARMONY  Good Heaven how like his mother  Lord  NORLAND  Taking him by the hand  I begin to think he isbut he was not so when I first took him No no if he had he would not have been thus near me nowbut to turn him away because his countenance is a little changed I think would not be right  EDWARD  to  Harmony  Pray Sir did you know my mother  HARMONY  I have seen her  EDWARD  Did  you  ever see her my Lord  Lord  NORLAND  I thought you had orders never to enquire about your parents Have you forgot those orders  EDWARD  No my Lord but when this gentleman said I was like my motherit put me in mind of her  HARMONY  You do not remember your mother do you  EDWARD  Sometimes I think I do I think sometimes I remember her kissing me when she and my father went on board of a ship and so hard she pressed meI think I feel it now  HARMONY  Perhaps she was the only Lady that ever saluted you  EDWARD  No Sir not by many  Lord  NORLAND  But pray young man to have done with this  subject what brought you here You seem to have forgot your errand  EDWARD  And so I had upon my word Speaking of my mother put it quite out of my headBut my Lord I came to let you know the robber who stopped you last night is taken  Lord  NORLAND  I am glad to hear it  EDWARD  I knew you would and therefore I begged to be the first to tell you  HARMONY  to Lord  Norland  Should you know the person again  Lord  NORLAND  I cannot say I should his face seemed so much distorted  HARMONY  Ay wretched man I suppose with terror  Lord  NORLAND  No it appeared a different passion from fear  EDWARD  Perhaps my Lord it was  your  fear that made you think so  Lord  NORLAND  No Sir I was not frightened  EDWARD  Then why did you give him your money  Lord  NORLAND  It was surprise caused me to do that  EDWARD  I wondered what it was You said it was not fear and I was sure it could not be love  HARMONY  How has he been taken  EDWARD  A person came to our steward and informed against himand Oh my Lord his poor wife told the officers who took him they had met with misfortunes which she feared had caused a fever in her husband's head and indeed they found him too ill to be removed and so she hoped she said "that as a man not in his perfect mind you would be merciful to him"  Lord  NORLAND  I will be just  EDWARD  And that is being merciful is it not my Lord  Lord  NORLAND  Not always  EDWARD  I thought it had beenIt is not  just  to be unmerciful is it  Lord  NORLAND  Certainly not  EDWARD  Then it must be  just  to have mercy  Lord  NORLAND  You draw a false conclusion Great as is the virtue of  mercy justice  is greater still  Justice  holds its place among those cardinal virtues which include all the lesserCome Mr Harmony will you go home with me And before I attend to this business let me persuade you to forget there is such a person in the world as Sir Robert and suffer me to introduce you to Miss Wooburn as the man who  HARMONY  I beg to be excusedBesides the consideration of Sir Robert I have another reason why I cannot go with you The melancholy tale which this young gentleman has been telling has cast a gloom on my spirits which renders me unfit for the society of a Lady  Lord  NORLAND  Now I should not be surprised were you to go in search of this culprit and his family and come to me to intreat me to forego the prosecution but before you ask me I tell you it is in vainI will not  HARMONY  Lord Norland I have lately been so unsuccessful in my petitions to you I shall never presume to interpose between your rigour and a weak sufferer more  Lord  NORLAND  Plead the cause of the good and I will listen but you find none but the wicked for your compassion  HARMONY  The good in all states even in the very jaws of death are objects of envy it is the bad who are the only real sufferers There where no internal consolation cheers who can refuse a little external comfortAnd let me tell you my Lord that amidst all your authority your state your grandeur I often pity you  Speaking with unaffected compassion  Lord  NORLAND  Goodday Mr Harmony and when you have apologised for what you have said we may be friends again  Exit leading off  Edward  HARMONY  Nay hear my apology now I cannotno it is not in my nature to live in resentment nor under the resentment of any creature in the world  Exit

given me a palpitation since the honeymoon  Enter Miss  WOOBURN  who starts on seeing Sir  Robert  he bows in great confusion  Miss  WOOBURN  Support me Heaven  Aside  Sir  ROBERT  Bows repeatedly and does not speak till after many efforts  Was ever man in such confusion before his wife  Aside  Miss  WOOBURN  Sir Robert having recovered in some measure from the surprise into which this intrusion

Miss  WOOBURN  And is this the motive of your visitthis the return  Sir  ROBERT  No Madam that obligation was not the motive which drew me hitherThe real cause of this seeming intrusion isyou are going to be married once more and I come to warn you of your danger  Miss  WOOBURN  That you did sufficiently in the marriagestate  Sir  ROBERT  But now I come to offer you advice that may be of the most material consequence should you really be determined to yield yourself again into the power of a husband  Miss  WOOBURN  Which I most assuredly am  Sir  ROBERT  Happy happy man How much is he the object of my envy None so well as I know how to envy him because none so well as I know how to value you  She offers to go  Nay by Heaven you shall not go till you have heard all that I came to say

kneeling  Maria Maria look at meLook at me in this humble stateCould you have suspected this Maria  Miss  WOOBURN  No nor can I conceive what this mockery means  Sir  ROBERT  It means that now you are

refusal  Lord  NORLAND  I will try howeverMadam quit the room instantly  Sir  ROBERT  My Lord she shall not quit it  Lord  NORLAND  I command her to go  Sir  ROBERT  And I command her to stay  Lord

supplicating attitude  Enter  EDWARD  shewing in Mr  SOLUS  and Mr  PLACID Edward  points to Sir  Robert  who has his back to them and goes off  Sir  ROBERT  Still on his knees and not perceiving their entrance  I cannot live without youReceive your penitent husband thus humbly acknowledging his faults and imploring you to accept him once again  SOLUS  Going up to Sir  Robert  Now is it wonderful that I should want a wife  PLACID  And is it to be wondered at if I should hesitate about parting with mine  Sir  ROBERT  Starts up in great confusion  Mr Solus Mr Placid I am highly displeased that my private actions should be thus inspected  SOLUS  No one shall persuade me now to live a day without a wife  PLACID  And no one shall persuade me now not to be content with my own

WOOBURN  My dear Mrs Placid if this visit is to me I take it very kind  Mrs  PLACID  Not absolutely to you my dear I saw Mr Placid's carriage at the door and so I stepped in to desire him to go home Go home directly  PLACID  Presently my dear I will go presently  Mrs  PLACID  Presently won't do I say directly There is a lady at my house in the greatest possible distress  whispers him  Lady

satisfaction of exposing your love and then enjoying the triumph of bidding you farewell for ever  Exit with Mrs  Placid  SOLUS  Looking steadfastly at Sir  Robert  He turns pale at the thoughts of losing her Yes I think I'll marry  Lord  NORLAND  Come Sir Robert it is in vain to loiter your doom is fixed  Sir  ROBERT  In a melancholy musing tone  Shall I then never again know what it is to have a heart like her's to repose my troubles on  SOLUS  Yes I am pretty sure I'll marry  Sir  ROBERT  A friend in all my anxieties a companion in all my pleasures a physician in all my sicknesses  SOLUS  Yes I  will  marry  Lord  NORLAND  Come come Sir Robert do not let you and I have any dispute  Leading him towards the door  Sir  ROBERT  Senseless man not to value those blessingsNot to know how to

Apartment at Lord  NORLAND's  Enter  HAMMOND  followed by Lady  ELEANOR  HAMMOND  MY Lord is busily engaged Madam I do not suppose he would see any one much less a stranger  Lady  ELEANOR  I am no stranger  HAMMOND  Your name then Madam  Lady  ELEANOR  That I cannot send in But tell him Sir I am the afflicted wife of a man who for some weeks past has given many fatal proofs of a disordered mind In one of those fits of phrensy he held an instrument of death meant for his own destruction to the breast of your Lord who by accident that moment passed and took from him what he vainly hoped might preserve his own life and relieve the wants of his family But his paroxysm over he shrunk from what he had done and gave the whole he had thus unwarrantably taken into a servant's hands to be returned to its lawful owner The man admitted to this confidence betrayed his trust and instead of giving up what was so sacredly delivered to him secreted it and to obtain the promised reward came to this house but to inform against the wretched offender who now only resting on your Lord's clemency can escape the direful fate he has incurred  HAMMOND  Madam the account you give makes me interested in your behalf and you may depend I will repeat it all with the greatest exactness  Exit  Hammond  Lady  ELEANOR  Looking around her  This is my father's house It is only through two rooms and one short passage and there he is sitting in his study Oh in that study where I even in the midst of all his business have been so often welcome where I have urged the suit of many an unhappy person nor ever urged in vain Now I am not permitted to speak for myself nor have one friendly voice to do that office for me which I have so often undertaken for others  Reenter  HAMMOND EDWARD  following  HAMMOND  My Lord says that any petition concerning the person you come about is in vain His respect for the laws of his country demands an example such as he means to make  Lady  ELEANOR  Am I am I to despair then  To  Hammond  Dear Sir would you go once more to him and humbly represent  HAMMOND  I should be happy to oblige you but I dare not take any more messages to my Lord he has given me my answerIf you will give me leave Madam I'll see you to the door  Crosses to the other side and Exit  Lady  ELEANOR  MiseryDistractionOh Mr Placid Oh  Mr Harmony Are these the hopes you gave me could I have the boldness to enter this house But you would neither of you undertake to bring me hereneither of you undertake to speak for me  She is following the Servant  Edward  walks softly after her till she gets near the door he then takes hold of her gown and gently pulls it she turns and looks at him  EDWARD  Shall I speak for you Madam  Lady  ELEANOR  Who are you pray young Gentleman Is it you whom Lord Norland has adopted for his son  EDWARD  I believe he has Madam but he has never told me so yet  Lady  ELEANOR  I am obliged to you for your offer but my suit is of too much consequence for  you  to undertake  EDWARD  I know what your suit is Madam because I was with my Lord when Hammond brought in your message and I was so sorry for you I came out on purpose to see youand without speaking to my Lord I could do you a great kindnessif I durst  Lady  ELEANOR  What kindness  EDWARD  But I durst notNo do not ask me  Lady  ELEANOR  I do not But you have raised my curiosity and in a mind so distracted as mine it is cruel to excite one additional pain  EDWARD  I am sure I would not add to your grief for the worldBut then pray do not speak of what I am going to sayI heard my Lord's lawyer tell him just now "that as he said he should not know the person again who committed the offence about which you came and as the man who informed against him was gone off there could be no evidence that he did the action but from a book a particular pocketbook of my Lord's which he forgot to deliver to his servant with the notes and money to return and which was found upon him at your house and this Lord Norland will affirm to be his"Now if I did not think I was doing wrong this is the very book  Takes a pocketbook front his pocket  I took it from my Lord's table but it would be doing wrong or I am sure I wish you had it  Looking wishfully at her  Lady  ELEANOR  It will save my life my husband's and my children's  EDWARD  trembling  But what is to become of me  Lady  ELEANOR  That Providence who never punishes the deed unless the  will  be an accomplice shall protect you for saving one who has only erred in a moment of distraction  EDWARD  I never did any thing to offend my Lord in my lifeand I am in such fear of him I did not think I ever shouldYet I cannot refuse  you  take it  Gives her the book  But pity me when my Lord shall know of it  Lady  ELEANOR  Oh should he discard you for what you have done it will embitter every moment of my remaining life  EDWARD  Do not frighten yourself about thatI think he loves me too well to discard me quite  Lady  ELEANOR  Does he indeed  EDWARD  I think he doesfor often when we are alone he presses me to his bosom so fondly you would not supposeAnd when my poor nurse died she called me to her bedside and told me but pray keep it a secretshe told me I washis grandchild  Lady  ELEANOR  You areyou are his grandchildI seeI feel you arefor I feel that I am your mother  Embraces him  Oh take this evidence back  returning the book  I cannot receive it from thee my childno let us all perish rather than my boy my only boy should do an act to stain his conscience or to lose his grandfather's love  EDWARD  What do you mean  Lady  ELEANOR  The name of the person with whom you lived in your infancy was Heyland  EDWARD  It was  Lady  ELEANOR  I am your mother Lord Norland's only child  Edward  kneels  who for one act of disobedience have been driven to another part of the globe in  poverty and forced to leave you my life behind  She embraces and raises him  Your father in his struggles to support us all has fallen a victim but Heaven which has preserved my child will save my husband restore his sense and once more  EDWARD  starting  I hear my Lord's stephe is coming this way Begone mother or we are all undone  Lady  ELEANOR  No let him come for though his frown should kill me yet must I thank him for his care of thee  She advances towards the door to meet him  Enter Lord  NORLAND  Falling on her knees  You love me 'tis in vain to say you do not You love my child and with whatever hardships you have dealt or still mean to deal by me I will never cease to think you love me nor ever cease my gratitude for your goodness  Lord  NORLAND  Where are my servants Who let this woman in  She rises and retreats from him alarmed and confused  EDWARD  Oh my Lord pity herDo not let me see her hardly treatedIndeed I cannot bear it  Enter  HAMMOND  Lord  NORLAND  to Lady  Eleanor  What was your errand here If to see your child take him along with you  Lady  ELEANOR  I came to see my fatherI have a house too full of such as he already  Lord  NORLAND  How did she gain admittance  HAMMOND  With a petition which I repeated to your Lordship  Exit  Hammond  Lord  NORLAND  Her husband then it was who  To Lady  Eleanor  But let him know for this boy's sake I will no longer pursue him  Lady  ELEANOR  For that boy's sake you will not pursue his father but for whose sake are you so tender of that boy 'Tis for mine for my sake and by that I conjure you  Offers to kneel  Lord  NORLAND  Your prayers are vain  To  Edward  Go take leave of your mother  for ever  and instantly follow me or shake hands with me for the last time and instantly begone with her  Edward  stands between them in doubt for some little time looks alternately at each with emotions of affection at last goes to his grandfather and takes hold of his hand  EDWARD  Farewell my Lord it almost breaks my heart to part from youbut if I have my choice I must go with my mother  Exit Lord  Norland  instantly  Lady  Eleanor  and her Son go off on the opposite side  SCENE II  Another Apartment at Lord  NORLAND's  Enter Miss  WOOBURN  and Mrs  PLACID  Mrs  PLACID  Well my dear farewellI have staid a great while longer than I intendedI certainly forgot to tell Mr Placid to come back after he had spoken with Lady Eleanor or he would not have taken the liberty not to have come  Miss  WOOBURN  How often have I lamented the fate of Lord Norland's daughter But luckily I have no personal acquaintance with her or I should probably feel a great deal more on her account than I do at presentShe had quitted her father's house before I came to it  Enter Mr  HARMONY  HARMONY  My whole life is passed in endeavouring to make people happy and yet they won't let meI flattered myself that after I had resigned all pretensions to you Miss Wooburn in order to accommodate Sir Robertthat after I had told both my Lord and him in what high estimation they stood in each other's opinion they would of course be friends or at least not have come to any desperate quarrelinstead of which what have they done but within this hour had a dueland poor Sir Robert  Miss  WOOBURN  For Heaven's sake tell me of Sir Robert  HARMONY  You were the only person he mentioned after  he received his wound and such encomiums as he uttered  Miss  WOOBURN  Good Heaven If he is in danger it will be vain to endeavour to conceal what I shall suffer  Retires a few paces to conceal her emotions  Mrs  PLACID  Was my husband there  HARMONY  He was one of the seconds  Mrs  PLACID  Then he shall not stir out of his house this month for it  HARMONY  He is not likely for he is hurt too  Mrs  PLACID  A great deal hurt  HARMONY  Don't alarm yourself  Mrs  PLACID  I don't  HARMONY  Nay if you had heard what he said  Mrs  PLACID  What did he say  HARMONY  How tenderly he spoke of you to all his friends  Mrs  PLACID  But what did he say  HARMONY  He said you had imperfections  Mrs  PLACID  Then he told a falsehood  HARMONY  But he acknowledged they were such as only evinced a superior understanding to the rest of your sexand that your heart  Mrs  PLACID  Bursting into tears  I am sure I am very sorry that any misfortune has happened to him poor silly man But I do not suppose  drying up her tears at once  he will die  HARMONY  If you will behave kind to him I should suppose not  Mrs  PLACID  Mr Harmony if Mr Placid is either dying or dead I shall behave with very great tenderness but if I find him alive and likely to live I will lead him such a life as he has not led a long time  HARMONY  Then you mean to be kind But my dear Miss Wooburn  going to her  why this seeming grief Sir Robert is still living and should he die of his wounds you may at least console yourself that it was not your cruelty which killed him  Miss  WOOBURN  Rather than have such a weight on my conscience I would comply with the most extravagant of his desires and suffer  his  cruelty to be the death of me  HARMONY  If those are your sentiments it is my advice that you pay him a visit in his affliction  Miss  WOOBURN  Oh no Mr Harmony I would not for the universe Mrs Placid do you think it would be proper  Mrs  PLACID  No I think it would notConsider my dear you are no longer a wife but a single Lady and would you run into the clutches of a man  HARMONY  He has no clutches Madam he is ill in bed and totally helplessBut upon recollection it would perhaps be needless to go for he may be too ill to admit you  Miss  WOOBURN  If that is the case all respect to my situation my character sinks before the strong desire of seeing him once more Oh were I even married to another I feel that in spite of all my private declarations or public vows I should fly from him to pay my duty where it was first plighted  HARMONY  My coach is at the door shall I take you to his house Come Mrs Placid wave all ceremonious motives on the present melancholy occasion and go along with Miss Wooburn and me  Miss  WOOBURN  But Mrs Placid perhaps poor Mr Placid is in want of your attendance at home  HARMONY  No they were both carried in the same carriage to Sir Robert's  Miss  WOOBURN  As  Harmony  leads her to the door  Oh how I long to see my dear husband that I may console him  Mrs  PLACID  Oh how I long to see my dear husband that I may quarrel with him  Exeunt  SCENE III  The Hall at Sir  ROBERT RAMBLE's  The  PORTER  discovered asleep  Enter a  FOOTMAN

must be certain is an exception  PORTER  No Lady can be an exception in my master's present state for I believe Sir but perhaps I should not speak of it I believe my master is nearly gone  Miss  WOOBURN  Oh support me Heaven  Mrs  PLACID  But has he his senses  PORTER  Not very clearly I believe  Miss  WOOBURN  Oh Mr Harmony let me see him before they are quite lost  PORTER  It is as much as

PORTER  What Madam  HARMONY  He does not understand you  To Miss  Wooburn  Come will you go back  PORTER  Do my Lady and call in the morning  Miss  WOOBURN  By that time he may be totally insensible

Gentlemen  Mrs  PLACID  Mr PlacidMr Placid are not you afraid  PLACID  No MadamI have consulted my friends I have drank two bottles of wine and I never intend to be afraid again  Miss  WOOBURN  to Sir  Robert  Can it be that I see you without a wound  Sir  ROBERT  No my life that you do not for I have a wound through my heart which none but you can cure But in despair of your aid I have flown to wine to give me a temporary relief by the loss of reflection  Mrs  PLACID  Mr Placid you will be sober in the morning  PLACID  Yes my dear and I will take care that you shall be dutiful in the morning  HARMONY  For shame How can you treat Mrs Placid thus You would not if you knew what kind things she has been saying of you and how anxious  she was when I told her you were wounded in a duel  Mrs  PLACID  Was not I Mr Harmony  Bursting into tears  PLACID  Aside to  Harmony  and Sir  Robert  I did not know she could cryI never saw it before and it has made me sober in an instant  Miss  WOOBURN

SOLUS  I am marriedI am married Wish me joy I am married  Sir  ROBERT  I cannot give you joy for envy  SOLUS  Nay I do not know whether you will envy me much when you see my spouseI cannot say she was exactly my choice However she is my wife now and that is a name so endearing I think I love her better since the ceremony has been performed  Mrs  PLACID  And pray when did it take place  SOLUS  This moment We are now returning from a friend's house where we have been joined and I felt myself so happy I could not pass Sir Robert's door without calling to tell him of my good fortuneAnd as I see your Lady here Sir Robert I guess you are just married too and so I'll hand my wife out of the carriage and introduce the two Brides to each other  Exit  Solus  Sir  ROBERT  You see my Lord what construction Mr Solus has put on this Lady's visit to me And by Heaven if you take her away it will be said that she came and offered herself and that I reject her  Miss  WOOBURN  Such a report would kill me  Enter  SOLUS  leading on Miss  SPINSTER  SOLUS  Mistress Solus  Introducing her  HARMONY  starting  My Relation Dear Madam by what strange turn of fortune do I see you become a wife  Mrs  SOLUS  Mr Harmony it is a weakness I acknowledge but you can never want an excuse for me when you call to mind "the scarcity of provisions"  SOLUS  Mr Harmony I have loved her ever since you told me she spoke so well of me behind my back  Enter  SERVANT  And whispers Mr  HARMONY  who follows him off  Lord  NORLAND  I agree with you Mr Solus that this is a most excellent proof of a person's disposition and in consideration Sir Robert that throughout all our many disagreements you have still preserved a respect for my character in my absence I do at last say to that Lady she has my consent to trust you again  Sir  ROBERT  And she will trust me I see it in her smiles Oh unexpected ecstasy  Enter Mr  HARMONY  HARMONY  Holding a letter in his hand  Amidst those bright prospects of joy which this company are contemplating I come to announce an event that ought to cloud the splendour of the horizonA worthy but an illfated man whom  ye were all acquainted with has just breathed his last  Lord  NORLAND  Do you mean the husband of my daughter  SOLUS  Do you mean my nephew  PLACID  Is it my friend  Sir  ROBERT  And my old acquaintance  HARMONY  Did Mr Irwin possess all those titles you have given him Gentlemen Was he your son  To Lord  Norland  Your nephew  To  Solus  Your friend  To Mr  Placid  And your old acquaintance  To Sir  Robert  How strange he did not know it  PLACID  He did know it  HARMONY  Still more strange that he should die for want and not apply to any of you  SOLUS  What Die for want in London Starve in the midst of plenty  HARMONY  No but he seized that plenty where law where honour where every social and religious tie forbad the trespass and in punishment of the guilt has become his own executioner  Lord  NORLAND  Then my daughter is wretched and her boy involved in his father's infamy  SOLUS  The fear of his ghost haunting me will disturb the joys of my married life  PLACID  Mrs Placid Mrs Placid my complying with your injunctions in respect of Mr Irwin will make me miserable for ever  Miss  WOOBURN  I wish he had applied to me  Sir  ROBERT  And as I refused him his request I would give half my estate he had  not  applied to me  HARMONY  And a man who always spoke so well of you all behind your backsI dare say that in his dying moments there was not one of you whom he did not praise for some virtue  SOLUS  No nowhen he was dying he would be more careful of what he said  Lord  NORLAND  Sir Robert goodday Settle your marriage as you and your Lady shall approve you have my good wishes But my spirits have received too great a shock to be capable of any other impression at present  Miss  WOOBURN  Holding him  Nay stay my Lord  SOLUS  And Mrs Solus let me hand you into your carriage to your company but excuse my going home with you  My  spirits have received too  great a shock for me to be capable of any other impression at present  HARMONY  Stopping  Solus  Now so loth am I to see any of you only for a moment in grief while I have the power to relieve you that I cannot helpYes my philanthropy will get the better of my justice  Goes to the door and leads on Lady  Eleanor Irwin  and  Edward  Lord  NORLAND  Runs to  Irwin  and embraces him  My son  Irwin  falls on his knees  I take a share in all your offencesThe worst of accomplices while I impelled you to them  IRWIN  On his knees  I come to offer my returning reason to offer my vows that while  that  reason continue so long will I be penitent for the phrensy which put your life in danger  Lady  ELEANOR  Moving timidly to her Father leading  Edward  by the hand  I come to offer you this child this affectionate child who in the midst of our caresses droops his head and pines for your forgiveness  Lord  NORLAND  Ah there is a corner of my heart left to receive him  Embraces him  EDWARD  Then pray my Lord suffer the corner to be large enough to hold my mother  Lord  NORLAND  My heart is softened and receives you all  Embraces Lady  Eleanor  who falls on her knees he then turns to  Harmony  Mr Harmony I thank you I most sincerely thank you for this the joyfullest moment of my life I not only experience release from misery but return to happiness  HARMONY  Goes hastily to  Solus  and leads him to  Irwin  then turns to Mr and Mrs  Placid  And now that I see you all reconciled I can say there are not two enemies in the whole circle of my acquaintance that I have not within these three days made friends  Sir  ROBERT  Very true Harmony for we should never have known half how well we all love one another if you had not told us  HARMONY  And yet my good friends notwithstanding the merit you may attribute to me I have one most tremendous fault and it weighs so heavy on my conscience I would confess what it is but that you might hereafter call my veracity in question  Sir  ROBERT  My dear Harmony without a fault you would not be a proper companion for any of us  Lord  NORLAND  And while a man like you may have among so many virtues some faults let us hope there may be found in each of us among all our faults some virtues  HARMONY  Yes my Lordand notwithstanding all our faults it is my sincere wish that the world may speak well of usbehind our backs  THE END  EPILOGUE  By M P ANDREWS ESQ  Spoken by Mrs MATTOCKS  "EACH has his fault" we readily allow  To this Decree our dearest friends must bow  One is too careless one is too correct  All save our own sweet self has some defect  And characters to ev'ry virtue dear  Sink from a hint or suffer by a sneer  "Sir Harry Blink Oh he's a worthy man  "Still anxious to do

discordant life  We bring to combat discontent and strife  And by the force of contrast sweetly prove  The charm that waits on fond and faithful love  When suited years and pliant tempers join  And the heart glows with energy divine  As the lov'd offspring of the happy pair  Oft climb the knee the envied kiss to share  Such joys this happy country long has known  Rear'd in the Cot reflected from the Throne  Oh may the glorious zeal the loyal stand  Which nobly animate this envied land  Secure to every breast with glad increase  The heartfelt blessings of domestic peace
