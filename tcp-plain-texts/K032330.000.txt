 THE Perjur'd Husband OR THE Adventures of VENICE A TRAGEDY As it is Acted at the THEATREROYAL IN  DRURYLANE  BY His MAJESTY's Servants  Written by Mrs CENTLIVRE  LONDON  Printed for W FEALES at  Rowe  's  Head  overagainst  St Clement  's  Church  in the  Strand  MDCCXXXVII  To His GRACE WRIOTHESLY DUKE of BEDFORD  May it please your Grace  _IT is the just Prerogative of true Greatness to be universally admir'd by all and one so eminently possess'd of it as your Grace can no more escape the Tribute of our Praise and Admiration than you can cease to deserve it Not that 'tis in the Power of any one or even the Applause of Multitudes to reach half your Merit yet may we be allow'd according to the Proportion of our poor Stock to throw in our Mite and not be frightned from the Hopes of your Grace's Patronage by considering the Unworthiness of the Offering for were none but worthy Offerings made the Gods themselves wou'd lose their Sacrifice and they that deserve most our Praise shou'd have it least because 'tis hardest to give them their Due  And 'tis impossible my Lord this Poem should find Sanctuary any where but in the Umbrage of your Favour for the Eyes of all Mankind are so fixt upon your Grace that 'twou'd be a Disappointment to the Publick to lay at any other's Door what is so much your Duee And tho' I hit not a  Wildair  for the Humour of the  Town in my Play I may boldly say I have copied the greatest Part of Mankind in the just Admiration of your Grace  Your particular Art in appearing free complaisant and conversible without quitting a Noble Greatness proper to yourself makes us at once approach you with Freedom and with Awe Your Goodness that makes you stoop to your Inferiors loses nothing by being view'd near at hand but is the more admir'd for it and thus we consider your Grace arriv'd at the Height of Greatness without a mortifying Reflection on the Lowness of our own Condition nor does the World envy the truly Great who by their Goodness and Affability make Mankind partake of their Felicity  I may plead Prescription in Excuse of this Presumption and tell how Poets in all Ages have pretended a Right to lay their Works at some Nobleman's Feet but I'd rather submit to your Grace's Goodness for if I have offended 'tis a Fault of the best kind and proceeds from too much Zeal to let the World know how much I am  My Lord  Your Grace's most Obedient and Devoted Humble Servant  Susanna Centlivre    PREFACE  _I SHOULD not trouble my Reader with a Preface if Mr  Collier  had taught Manners to  Masks  Sense to  Beaus  and Good Nature to  Criticks  as well as Morality to the Stage the first are sure to envy what they can't equal and condemn what they don't understand the  Beaus  usually take a greater Liberty with our Sex than they wou'd with their own because there's no Fear of drawing a Duel upon their Hands the latter are a Sort of rude splenatick Men that seldom commend any thing but what they have had a Hand in These snarling Sparks were pleas'd to carp at one or two Expressions which are spoken in 'em Aside by one of the inferior Characters in the Drama and without considering the Reputation of the Persons in whose Mouths the Language is put condemn it strait for loose and obscure Now with Submission to better Judges I cannot believe that a PrayerBook shou'd be put into the Hands of a Woman whose innate Virtue won't secure her Reputation nor is it reasonable to expect a Person whose Inclinations are always forming Projects to the Dishonour of her Husband shou'd deliver her Commands to her Confident in the Words of a Psalm I heartily wish that those that find fault with the Liberty of my Stile wou'd be pleas'd to set a Pattern to the Town by retrenching some of their Debaucheries for Modesty thrives best by Example Modest Language from the truly Virtuous is expected I mean such as will neither act ill nor suffer ill to be acted It is not enough that  Lucy  says she's honest in having denied the Brutal Part who ever thinks Virtue centers in that has a wrong Notion of it no Virtue is a tender Plant which cannot live in tainted Ground Virtue is what the Air  of Flattery cannot blast nor the vile sordid Dross of Gain poison and she that can withstand these two Shocks may be stil'd truly Virtuous I ask my Reader's Pardon for my Bluntness but I hope none of my Sex so qualified will condemn me for exposing the Vices of the seeming Religious  I fear there are but too many hit by the Character of Signora  Pizalta  I wish for the sake of the reverse Party there were fewer or they better known since the malicious World are so apt to judge of Peoples Inclinations by the Company they keep which is sometimes authentick but not always an infallible Rule I shall say little in Justification of the Play only desire the Reader to judge impartially and not condemn it by the Shortness of its Life since the Season of the Year never promis'd much better Success It went off with general Applause and 'tis the Opinion of some of our best Judges that it only wanted the Addition of good Actors and a full Town to have brought me a Sixth Night there having been worse Plays within

in his Nightgown a Table with Lights and Letters lying on the Table  Bas  All Things lie hush'd in peaceful Silence here  All but  Bassino  's MindOh happy he  Who lives secure and free from Love's Alarms  But happier far who Master of himself  Ranges abroad without that Clog a Wife  Oh rigorous Laws impos'd on Freeborn Man  On Man by bounteous Nature first design'd  The Sovereign Lord of all the Universe  Why must his generous Passion thus be starv'd  And be confin'd to one alone  The Woman whom Heaven sent as a Relief  To ease the Burden of a tedious Life  And be enjoy'd when summon'd by Desire  Is now become the Tyrant of our Fates    Takes up a Letter  But hold  Bassino  whither does thy Passion  Hurry thy wandering Reason Let this Letter  Recall the Fugitive and fix thy Senses  On dutious LoveA Wife so young so fair  So excellent whose Charms not three Months since  Did fire thy Soul a Wife who dotes on thee  A Wife to whom thou sworest eternal Love  By Heaven I swear again I will be true  This Thought again restores my Peace of Mind  No charming Wife no dear  Placentia  no  Thou shalt not beg in vain I will return    Kisses the Letter  But who comes hereMy Friend  Armando  Enter  Armando  Arm  Dear Friend I heard  The Conflict of your Passion and my Joys  Are now compleat since Virtue gains the Day  Bas  Yes dear  Armando  the Conflict is o'er  And I'm resolv'd to fly

dear Mate Haste then my Friend to drive  That Cloud of Sorrow which o'recasts her Mind  And like the Sun dispel her gloomy Thoughts  Bas  Thanks for your Counsel  You like a God support my feeble Virtue  This very Morning I'll prepare for  Turin    Where Time and Absence will deface the Image  Of that bewitching Beauty which how haunts  My tortur'd MindYet first I'll take my Leave  Of this fair CharmerAnd Heaven grant  That I may see her unconcern'd  Arm  My Lord what d'you mean  Have you well weigh'd the Danger of this Visit  Bas  What Danger can there be  Arm  Danger my LordConsider well how feeble  Our Reason is against the Pow'r of Beauty  Bas  My Resolution's firm no Charm can shake it  Arm  If not her Beauty fear her Syren Tongue  Fear her endearing Prayers her fond Reproaches  Her tender Sighs her Vows her trickling Tears  Nayif all these prove vain fear her Despair  A Woman an abandon'd Woman's Rage  Bas  Were there more Dangers yet I'll stand 'em all  My Honour bids me pay this parting Visit  My Heart shall have no Share in what I'll speak  Trust me this once and be yourself a Witness  Bassino  can controul unlawful Love  Arm  My Lord 'tis with Regret I see you go  May Heaven assist you in this dangerous Strife  SCENE III  Aurelia  's Chamber    She in an Undress with  Florella  Aur  No more of thatCease thy ungrateful Suit  Alonzo  is a Man I cannot love  I own he's witty generous and brave  Has all the Charms that Nature can bestow  To fire a Woman's HeartYet I'm insensible  His very Sight chills all my trembling Spirits  Therefore name him no moreI charge thee do not  Flor  Madam I've doneYet shall I be permitted  To ask a Question Are you then resolved  Ne'er to admit a Passion in your Breast  Aur  Oh Dear  Florella  press not a Confession  Which but too well my Eyes themselves disclose  Alas I loveI love to such Excess  That tho' I know I'm lov'd again my Mind  Is still perplex'd with Doubts and jealous Fears  Flor  You love and are belov'd Then sure you reach  The Height of human Bliss and bounteous Heaven  Can scarce give moreBut who's the happy Man  Is it not Count  Bassino  Aur  Oh charming Name there's Musick in that Sound  Yes Count  Bassino  is the Man I love  Canst thou now blame my Coldness to  Alonzo  Flor  Forgive me Madam if I dare persume  To speak my Sentiments I must confess  Bassino  is a Man of excellent Virtue  His Education at the Court of  Savoy    Has still refin'd what he receiv'd from Nature  His Person too is charming  And what most Women court he has a Title  But then consider you are unacquainted  With his Estate and tho' his Equipage  Denotes an ample Fortune yet we see  Many a Stranger here during the Carnival  Who makes a Figure by industrious Gaming  As for  Alonzo  he was born at  Venice    Of Noble Parents his Estate a large one  Even from his Youth you had his amorous Wishes  And as he grew in Years his Love encreas'd  You lov'd him tooNay which is more your Father  Approv'd your mutual Loves and at his Death  Bequeath'd you to  Alonzo    Aur  Oh my  Florella  thou hast rouz'd a Thought  Which will for every break  Aurelia  's Rest  I know my Father's Tenderness to me  Made him confirm  Alonzo  's Suit for then  I lov'd  Alonzo    But were my gentle Father still alive  I'm sure he would not cross my Inclinations  But Oh name not my Father I cannot bear  The sad Remembrance of so great a Loss    Weeps  Flor  But fear you not t'offend his peaceful Ghost  By breaking with the Man he destin'd yours  Aur  'Tis not my Fault and just Heaven must forgive  What Heaven decreesYes 'tis my cruel Stars  That made my Heart inconstant to  Alonzo    'Tis with Regret I break my plighted Faith  In vain I strive to check my newborn Love  I cannot cannot live without  Bassino    Flor  Madam I wish your Passion ne'er prove fatal  But much I fear this inauspicious Match  Enter  Bassino Armando  Aur  May Heaven avert th' unlucky Combination  Of our presaging Thoughts For know I tremble too  But here's the Man that will dispel my Fears  Arm  to  Bass  My Lord remember  To keep your Resolution  Bas  to  Arm  YesI will keep it  To  Aur    Madam you will pardon  A Morning Visit when you know what Reasons  Press'd me to fix it on this early Hour  By Letters from the Court I was last Night  Commanded to return with Speed to  Turin    And thence set out for  France  to represent  My Sovereign Leige in solemn Embassy  This Day I must prepare to take my Journey  Tho' 'tis with killing Grief I leave my dear  My fair  Aurelia    To  Arm    Now my  Armando

you now forget your solemn Vows  Why have I met with this inhuman Usage  Bas  Madam my Prince's Orders  Are absolute My Honour is concern'd  Aur  Must a vain Title be preferr'd to Love  But noYou never lov'd'twas base Deceit  Curst curst dissembling Men Their flattering Tongues  Can feign a Passion that will look like Love  Till by Degrees they get us in their Power  Then with bold Impudence they draw the Vizor  And shew the Cheat that mock'd our credulous Hopes  Faithless  Bassino    How oft you swore your Love cou'd ne'er expire  How oft you swore one Smile of mine had Charms  Even above the Glories of a Crown  Those were the Oaths I fondly did believe  Those Words convey'd a Poison to my Heart  And even now I feel its mighty Force  My Head turns giddy and my trembling Knees  Betray their sinking Burden  Alas I faint I die    She faints  Bassino  runs and embraces he  Bass  Oh stay my Love my Life my Soul my all▪  The Conflict's past and I am thine again  But she is breathless Oh ye rigorous Gods  Give back her Soul or let my own be plung'd  To dark  Elysium  Oh my dear  Aurelia    Hugs he  Arm  Is this your Resolution By Heaven I blush  To call you Friend Your Wife my Lord remembe  Your Wife  Bass  Curse on that Name  Urge me no more to follow your Chimera's  Left you oblige me to break off that Friendship  You blush to ownOh my  Aurelia  Arm aside  How sweet is treacherous Vice how e  ge  Fond Man pursues his Ruin  All Arguments were vainyet still one Way remain  Which cannot fail to stop the Progress of this impio  Lov  His Wife by my Direction

Lover's Watch which he swears does not at all agree with his Constitution He hates Injunctions of Love like those of Penance For the one says he is no more pleasurable to the Body than the other beneficial to the Soul  L  Piz  What a fine Gallant I'm like to have with these Principles Wellwhat did he say to a Summons from a Woman of my Quality Did it not make him wish the Time of Assignation were sooner than the Appointment in the Letter  Lucy  He first hum'd over your Billet and pausing a while he desir'd me to stay for an Answer in a next Room then coming to me he ask'd me what Countrywoman you were For said he if she should prove an old Acquaintance I would use her damnablyBut when I and assur'd him you never saw the Outside of these Walls he began to have that Desire which all Men have to a new Face  L  Piz  Very well and what then  Luc  He strait enquir'd whether you were black brown fair old young Maid Wife or Widow I told him you was a wretched Wise to an old impotent  rich covetous noble  Venetian  beautiful young generous and of a fair Complexion He hugg'd me at these Words seem'd transported with the News and swore that in Intrigues a Wife was most suitable to his Temper for said he there's neither Children to father nor Honour to repair and where his Pocket and Liberty are safe he is contented to venture his Body and Soul  L  Piz  Excellent Maxims  Lucy  In short Madam he says he has had several Bills of this Nature drawn upon him of late and how much his Stock may be exhausted he knows not but however he'll meet you and if he cannot answer your Expectation he'll give you Earnest  L  Piz  You talk merrily Girl I hope you did not tell my Name I should be loath to trust a Man of his Character with my Reputation at first Dash  Lucy  No Madam I only told your Quality  L  Piz  That's well Oh Reputation what several Sorts of Slavery do we undergo to preserve thee for to be thought virtuous we are forced to be constantly railing against Vice tho' our Tongues and Maxims seldom agree  Lucy  Alas Madam that Pretence is grown too common For the Men now take it for granted that a Lady is very near surrendring when once she holds out that Flag of Defiance  L  Piz  WellMen use us very barbarously They will neither suffer us to be honest nor allow us to be thought soHere take this Key and secure every thing that concerns my Reputation And if my Husband wakes ere I come back you may easily find some Excuse to prevent his Enquiries for the Carnival allows us more Liberty than at other times we dare pretend toI know thy

injure so good a Woman for the World  Piz  Pshaw pshawWhere's the Injury done to her Child Adod I'll give thee a hundred Crowns  Lucy  No Injury say you my Lord Why I wonder you should be so jealous of my Lady and preach such religious Maxims to her when your own Principles are quite opposite  Piz  Look ye Child a Man may do that which would look abominable in a WifeA Woman's Reputation is a nice Thing  Lucy  'Tis soand therefore 'tis but Reason I should take Care of mine  Piz  Prithee no more of that Thy Reputation shall be safe I'll marry thee to my Gentleman  Lucy  GentlemanValet FaughAnd

by this single Act we plainly see  That Vengeance always treads on Perjury  And tho' sometimes no Bolts be at us hurl'd  Whilst we enjoy the Pleasures of this World  Yet a Day waits a Day of general Doom  When guilty Souls must to an Audit come  Then that we may not tremble blush or fear  Let our Desires be just our Lives unsullied here    Exeunt Omnes  FINIS  BOOKS Printed for W FEALES at  Rowe
