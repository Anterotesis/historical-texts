 THE Siege of AQUILEIA  A TRAGEDY  As it is acted at the THEATREROYAL IN DRURYLANE  Me non oracula certum  Sed mors certa facit pavido fortique cadendum est  Hoc satis est dixisse Jovem  LUCAN  DUBLIN Printed for G and A EWING in  Damestreet  MDCCLX  PROLOGUE  Spoken by Mr GARRICK  WHEN Philip's son led forth his warlike band  To die or conquer in a distant land  To fan the fire a martial muse he chose  From Homer's song a new Achilles rose  When generous Athens her prime trophies won  Vanquisb'd Darius and Darius' son  The stage breath'd warthe soldiers bosom burn'd  And fiercer to the field each chief return'd  Now when the world resounds with loud alarms  When victory sits plan'd on Britain's arms  Be war our theme the hero's glorious toil  And virtue springing from the iron soil  Our scenes present a siege in story known  Where magnanimity and valour shone  If nature guides us if the hand of truth  Draws the just portrait of a Roman youth  Who with the best and noblest passions sir'd  In the same moment conquer'd and expir'd  Perhaps your bearts may own the pictur'd woe  And from a fonder source your sorrows flow  Whilst warm remembrance aids the poet's strain  And England weeps for English heroes slain  Dramatis Personae  MEN  AEMILIUS Consul of Rome and Governor of Aquileia  Mr GARRICK  Sons of the Consul  PAULUS  Mr AUSTIN  TITUS  Mr HOLLAND  Officers in the Army of

ACKMAN  WOMEN  CORNELIA Wife to the Consul Mrs CIBBER  THE Siege of AQUILEIA  A TRAGEDY  ACT I SCENE I  The Palace Court  Enter  PAULUS  and  TITUS  THIS is no time to strive for vain renown  The fate of Rome remember that my brother  Depends on the Defence of Aquileia  TITUS  PAULUS I know  PAULUS  But thou dost not consider  Th' importance of this war We fight not now  As oft since Freedom fell our fathers fought  When Latian chiefs contended who should reign  With half the senate listed on each side  The victor still was Roman and rever'd  The gods and temples of immortal Rome  But o'er yon mighty host that girds our walls  Fierce MAXIMIN commands whether of Thrace  Or wild Dalmatia so obscure his birth  Himself scarce knows but sure Barbarian born  This savage soldier nurs'd in blood and war  Whom military frenzy hath set up  To trample on mankind abhors a Roman  And marks for death the noble and the brave  His yoke at last th' indignant senate scorns  The slumb'ring Genius of our country wakes  And rouses slothful Italy to arms  The furious tyrant from the frontier hastes  Like a wild beast gall'd by the hunter's spear  And breathing vengeance rushes upon Rome  Here first oppos'd tenfold his fury burns  Here in the pass of fate our father stands  Defies and stops the monster in his rage  Till Rome's last legions come to give him battle  Now when a soldier's life is of such moment  When destiny hangs on a single day  To fight for glory TITUS were a crime  TITUS  No PAULUS no it is not fame alone  That TITUS seeks to purchase from the foe  Tho' such a crime the gods and men would pardon  I know the peril that o'er Rome impends  And know the hated cause of all our ills  That army only brave against their country  I mean to smite them and their giant leader  Whom nature for a gladiator form'd  To be the sport and not the lord of Rome  The blow once struck our foe must raise the siege  Or waste his veterans in vain attacks  And give to GORDIANUS easy conquest  PAULUS  Were this a frontier city far from Rome  And yon huge host compos'd of foes remote  German or Parthian I would say to thee  Lead on my brother Shield to shield we'd go  And fire yon turret or together perish  But now when conquest by delay is gain'd  When Aquileia guards the walls of Rome  Dread of the great event has so possess'd me  That like the Persian soldier I could stay  My arm uplifted patient to the call  Of cautious Duty  TITUS  And renouncing fame  Oh PAULUS you have gain'd long since the prize  That I contend for Every martial palm  Thy sword hath won When I like thee am great  In deeds of arms like thee I may be wary  Now to my brother I lay bare my breast  This famous siege approaches to its end  Whatever end the ruling gods ordain  Yet no distinguish'd action graces me  I've done my duty That I reckon nothing  The meanest soldier has not shrunk from duty  Son of AEMILIUS and thy brother PAULUS  I must do more and by the gods I will  Here I have found a path that leads to glory  Do not oppose me elsewe're friends no more  Our father comes Speak not against my purpose  And I shall move the consul's noble mind  Enter  AEMILIUS  AEMILIUS  Health to my sons  PAULUS  and  TITUS  Heaven guard our father's life  AEMILIUS  And bless my children ha your looks are keen  Your's chiefly TITUS what hath stirr'd your spirit  How points the enemy This quiet night  In preparation past portends a storm  PAULUS  On that attack which threats the eastern gate  The enemy hath labour'd all night long  Repairing what the river's rage had ruin'd  AEMILIUS  It was a friendly flood The river god  With all his waters guards his native walls  On that strong quarter they can ne'er prevail  The north I fear where yon stupendous tower  Our works commands  TITUS  It shall not long command  Let but the consul grant me my desire  AEMILIUS  What would my son  TITUS  Their tower is weakly guarded  At break of day a soldier from yon camp  Fled to my post hollow and gaunt he was  His shrivell'd limbs scarce bore his sounding arms  Like him he said with toil and famine worn  Were half the tyrant's host For MAXIMIN  Mad with delay and fiercer from repulse  Reviles his soldiers drives them to the trench  With whips and sharp reproach This day o'ercome  By strong necessity he breathes a while  And sends his legions forth to gather in  Whatever this exhausted region yields  I saw the busy foragers in troops  March and disperse themselves on every side  Like playful children on a summer day  Secure and careless for no martial band  Of late hath sallied from our guarded gates  This is the time Permit me O my father  Now to attack their ill defended lines  And fire that mighty tower in which they trust  AEMILIUS  Well hast thou spoke my son thy zeal I love  Nor must thy skill and judgment pass unprais'd  Be thus attentive still and trust me TITUS  In future sieges and in other wars  Swift execution shall thy purpose honour  TITUS  Ne'er shall I see another siege like this  Ne'er draw my sword in such a glorious cause  Alas my lord check not my spring of thought  Nor nip the only bud it yet has borne  AEMILIUS  Riper occasions will thy valour claim  Danger comes on Typhaeuslike it comes  Whose fabled stature every hour encreas'd  TITUS  O judge not of the counsel by the weight  Of him that gives it Would to heaven my lord  That I could now divest me of that youth  Which mars my credit Chearfully I'd step  Far into age to gain but for a day  The grave authority which years bestow  PAULUS  What brings the brave Numidian GARTHA hither  Enter  GARTHA  GARTHA  Hail to the general  AEMILIUS  Hail valiant GARTHA  How has the morning past where you command  GARTHA  It has been busy The presumptuous foe  In loose disorder'd squadrons rang'd the fields  I watch'd the time and sudden as the blast  That rises in the desart out we rush'd  And swept them from the plain Safe in our speed  We urg'd the chace far as the rising ground  And unmolested view'd the camp below  This worthy of your notice I observ'd  Their wond'rous tower the work of many a day  Stands now protected by a feeble guard  TITUS  Thanks for thy welcome tidings noble GARTHA  The guardian gods of Rome bend from their skies  And point this action out Hear me my father  If ever since my birth I gave thee joy  If e'er thou did'st as parents oft are wont  Interpret large the promise of my childhood  O hear and grant my chief and dear request  Let me go forth be this my first exploit  To wrap in fire the tyrant's boasted tower  That Rome who glories in the Aemilian line  May join your TITUS to his kindred names  AEMILIUS  In thee the spirit of thy fathers speak  Or some superior power thy bosom fires  Whom I oppose no more Go and fulfil  Thy destiny Brave GARTHA too shall add  His troops to thine Prepare what else  TITUS  'Tis done  Destructive instruments and balls of fire  Are ready at the gate  AEMILIUS  Farewel my son  If you prevail urge not too far your fortune  Remember still my words that when we meet  I may have cause to praise thy conduct then  As now thy courage TITUS  TITUS  GARTHA come  Exeunt  TITUS  and  GARTHA  AEMILIUS  PAULUS lead thou thy legion to the gate  And favour their retreat It may be needful  But mix not in the fight for mighty cities  Have been by such temerity surpriz'd  PAULUS  Would there was no Roman breast more prone  To rash attempts than mine I wish my lord  That I had led and TITUS had sustain'd me  Enter an  OFFICER  OFFICER  Consul of Rome this arrow thus inscrib'd  Fell on the green slop'd bank fast by my post  And as it bears your name myself have brought it  AEMILIUS  reads  "In three days hence even with the ides of June  "The Roman army comes to your relief  "Be sparing of your troops protract the siege  "Thou art the shield of Rome and GORDIANUS"  AEMILIUS  Soldier return and publish to the legions  The welcome tidings of a near relief  OFFICER  Gladly my lord Much have the troops endur'd  And with unshaken constancy they suffer  Exit  OFFICER  PAULUS  Had this advice arriv'd ere TITUS went  I think he hardly had obtain'd permission  Tho' MAXIMIN should raise an hundred towers  And like the Giants when they warr'd with Jove  Pile mountains on each other high as heaven  For three short days his fury we may scorn  AEMILIUS  Go and prevent the sally Tell thy brother  What the imperial mandate here contains  It is the emperor's command recalls him  PAULUS  With pleasure I obey  Exit  PAULUS  AEMILIUS  alone  I must reserve  My sons my soldiers for a nobler service  And in the battle aid the Roman arms  The hour approaches that must give to Rome  A legal lord by her own suffrage chosen  Or fix a barb'rous master o'er mankind  That barb'rous master I shall never own  If I could stoop to drag the servile chain  And live the vassal of a vile Dalmatian  Yet I could not conceal me in the croud  Of prostrate Romans I that stood aloft  And bore thro' Italy the senate's standard  Fast by that standard will I plant my foot  There with my boys a glorious conquest gain  Or end at once the long Aemilian line  CORNELIA  appears  Behold the only object that can shake  One moment my resolve What will become  Of thee CORNELIA doom'd perhaps to live  Like PRIAM's wretched queen the slave of those  By whom her sons her husband country fell  Enter  CORNELIA  and  PRIEST  CORNELIA  Why is my lord alone Where are my sons  AEMILIUS  This day CORNELIA brings us welcome tidings  The Emperor approaches with his host  CORNELIA  Thanks to the gods But say where are my children  AEMILIA  This instant I expect them to return  CORNELIA  From whence AEMILIUS  AEMILIUS  From the northern gate  TITUS had form'd a brave a great design  But when assurance of relief arriv'd  My PAULUS hasten'd to recal his brother  CORNELIA  'Tis as I fear'd PAULUS will come too late  The omens of the gods must be fulfill'd  AEMILIUS  What evil omens has CORNELIA seen  CORNELIA  'Tis strange to tell but as I slumb'ring lay  About that hour when glad Aurora springs  To chace the lagging shades methought I was  In Rome and full of peace the city seem'd  My mind oblivious too had lost it's care  Serene I step'd along the lofty hall  Imbellish'd with the statues of our fathers  When suddenly an universal groan  Issued at once from every marble breast  Aghast I gaz'd around when slowly down  From their high pedestals I saw descend  The murder'd GRACCHI Hand in hand the brothers  Stalk'd towards me As they approach'd more near  They were no more the GRACCHI but my sons  PAULUS and TITUS At that dreadful change  I shriek'd and wak'd But never from my mind  The spectacle shall part Their rueful eyes  Their cheeks of stone the look of death and woe  So strange a vision ne'er from fancy rose  The rest my lord this holy Priest can tell  AEMILIUS  Why this is nothing but a common dream  For often when the waking mind is charg'd  With apprehension of uncertain ills  Imagination in the hour of rest  Presenteth wild fantastic combinations  That have a shade and tincture of the past  But 'tis the weakness of the human mind  That joins the vain assemblage to futurity  PRIEST  Men reason thus my lord who think their reason  Can grasp and measure all presumptuous thought  Sounds more than human have been often heard  And shapes celestial seen by mortal man  But yet most frequent in the silent night  Are warnings given by strange portentuous dreams  The history of mighty Rome abounds  In awful instances The old republic  By them has oft been sway'd and oft preferv'd  AEMILIUS  But tell me Priest of JOVE what do the gods  By their more certain omens now declare  PRIEST  Consul with the most venerable rites  That our religion knows I have perform'd  A sacrifice to Capitolian JOVE  This pious matron present never yet  Since at the altars of the gods I stood  Did I behold such omens of calamity  Yet they were intricate ambiguous dark  And tho' some parts I might interpret fair  Even these were mix'd and full of dire perplexity  No further can I see into the cloud  That veils the will of heaven but this I say  And by the scepter of the god I serve  It is the truth Some dreadful danger hangs  O'er thee thyself this city or thy race  Shout  CORNELIA  Ha what means that shout  AEMILIUS  It is a joyful shout  Behold the cause see where that dusky smoke  Darkens the air And now the flame bursts out  Their turret blazes and my TITUS conquers  CORNELIA  O heaven and earth O son too well belov'd  Why do these cruel omens check my joy  Enter an  OFFICER  OFFICER  Consul your valiant son hath fir'd the tower  But whilst he urg'd too far the flying foe  A band that lay conceal'd beyond the height  Has gain'd the plain between him and the city  AEMILIUS  O rashly brave whom I forewarn'd in vain  Retire CORNELIA yet he may be rescu'd  LUCIUS  Enter another  OFFICER  LUCIUS  The northern gate unguarded stands  For when brave PAULUS saw his brother's peril  He with his legion rush'd upon the foe  And furious is the fight  CORNELIA  Both both are lost  AEMILIUS  Unhappy youths My steady PAULUS too  Where is our discipline obedience where  I have no leisure now for words CORNELIA  Implore the gods to guard you and your children  Exit with his attendants  Manent  CORNELIA  and  PRIEST  CORNELIA  Perhaps ere this CORNELIA has no children  They both are fallen into the fatal snare  Tremendous oracle too late reveal'd  PRIEST  Abandon not thy soul to such despair  The sword of war devouring as it is  Consumes not all The destin'd number die  And from the bloodiest field still some return  CORNELIA  My sons will ne'er return I know them well  The noble heart of TITUS if he lives  This instant swells with grief and pride and shame  Will he the author of this fatal combat  Forsake the soldiers whom he led to slaughter  Return discomfited and sav'd by flight  To bear reproach and blush in Aquileia  He will not holy Flamen Nor will PAULUS  Calm as he is and master of himself  My generous PAULUS will not leave his brother  Alas I never shall behold them more  This is the evil that the gods foretold  Ye constant matrons of Rome's former days  Alas I have no fortitude like yours  Mine were no publick cares In the mild shade  Of sweet domestic happiness I liv'd  Till this fierce tempest rose the storm of war  Whose rage hath burst on the Aemilian race  PRIEST  Lady retire I to the walls will go  And learn what has befallen Remember thou  How oft in human life the great conclusion  Of fear'd and wish'd events mocks all conjecture  Exeunt  End of the first Act  ACT II SCENE I  Enter  PRIEST  PRIEST  TOO soon thy omens are accomplish'd JOVE  O wretched parents O devoted race  Enter  LUCIUS  LUCIUS  CORNELIA comes impatient of thy stay  PRIEST  How shall my tongue perform a faithful office  And tell CORNELIA what my eyes beheld  Her sons I saw surrounded by the foe  And their small troops seem'd like a bank of fand  Which by the flowing tide encompass'd round  Each moment wastes and lessens to the view  Their wretched father saw and could not save them  For full oppos'd to him the tyrant stood  With half his host embattled Thrice AEMILIUS  Came to the front of his remaining troops  As if he meant to rush upon the foe  And thrice the consul pull'd the father back  Then looking down and leaning on his sword  The tears fast trickling down the warrior's cheeks  He paus'd a while and turn'd him to the city  Enter  CORNELIA  CORNELIA  Thou bring'st no comfort Terror and dismay  Are written on thy brow Haste tell me Flamen  PRIEST  Behold a soldier bleeding from the field  Enter  GARTHA  wounded  CORNELIA  'Tis the Numidian chief  GARTHA  Lady these wounds  Which bleed to death make GARTHA not asham'd  That he alone revisits Aquileia  Involuntary messenger am I  Of tidings harsh to tell My fiery steed  Gall'd with an arrow bore me from the plain  Where still your valiant sons maintain the fight  And with amazing actions fate suspend  The boldest soldiers of the tyrant's host  Shrink from their rage Lady I speak with pain  This to the consul I advis'd the sally  And fell into the ambush I rejoice  That I shall not survive it  PRIEST  Help he faints  GARTHA  Ch would I had fallen at the feet of TITUS  Enter Attendants  PRIEST  Support and bear him hence  CORNELIA  O generous GARTHA  Too dearly hast thou prov'd thy constant faith  Exit  GARTHA  supported  No more I hear the shouts of distant war  'Tis horrid silence all The work of death  Is over doubt and fear are at an end  Now certain anguish and despair prevail  Enter  AEMILIUS  attended  My husband  AEMILIUS  Oh CORNELIA wretched dame  Look not to me I bring no consolation  I cannot comfort thee I could not save  My children from destruction Rigid duty  Made me spectator of their overthrow  O fatal ensigns of unhappy power  O had AEMILIUS been a poor Centurion  He might unheeded have forsook his station  And perish'd with his children  CORNELIA  They are dead  PAULUS and TITUS dead Their mother lives  Ye all directing gods whom we adore  Whom I with spotless hands have ever serv'd  Is misery like this my just reward  Your dearest gifts are to destruction turn'd  Had I not been the fond the happy mother  Of sons for whom all mothers envy'd me  I had not been above all women wretched  PRIEST  Great are thy woes CORNELIA great indeed  Yet not unfrequent in this changeful world  Are woes like thine and greater still than thine  The famous matron of thy name and blood  The first CORNELIA saw her godlike sons  In Rome betray'd and slain by Roman hands  And oft in every age have wretched mothers  Surviv'd their families' their country's ruin  And liv'd sad captives in a foreign land  No kindred ear to hear no eye to weep  In pity of their woes no human face  For them to look on but the hateful face  Of foes who made them childless widows slaves  To thee remain thy husband and thy country  In whose defence thy sons so greatly died  Thee Rome shall honour and revere in thee  The sacred memory of her heroes slain  AEMILIUS  It is the right the birthright of our house  For Rome to die in every signal strife  In every struggling period of the state  My sires have bled My sons have chose their time  Bravely they fought and nobly were they slain  Rome still shall stand tho' the AEMILII fall  The tyrant's works are levell'd with the ground  And his proud tower yet smokes upon the plain  Our ramparts now his fierce assaults desy  The Roman army like a gather'd storm  Rolls towards him My sons shall be reveng'd  My eyes shall see my sword shall share the vengeance  CORNELIA  Mean while unburied on the bloody field  Amidst the common heap my children lie  Majestic PAULUS and my lovely TITUS  Is this the end of all your mother's care  Some fierce barbarian now insults the dead  Adding dishonest wounds O might not gold  Their dear remains redeem Alas alas  'Tis the sole consolation I can hope for  To save them from the beasts and birds of prey  That howl and scream around these fatal walls  To fold once more their bodies in my arms  To lay them decent on the funeral pile  And o'er their ashes pour a parent's heart  AEMILIUS  Mindful of that sad duty I sent forth  A herald to the tyrant and expect  Each moment his return The trumpet sounds  Enter Herald with an Officer of  MAXIMIN's  'Tis he and with him one whose lofty port  And splendid arms bespeak his high command  CORNELIA  Forgive O chief unknown a mother's grief  Which short'ning the respect thy presence claims  Hastes to enquire if MAXIMIN will give  The bodies of her children to the tomb  OFFICER  Far be its dismal honours from your offspring  Lady your valiant sons survive the field  CORNELIA  Are they not dead were not the AEMILII slain  On yonder field Their father saw them fall  OFFICER  Faint with long fighting and encompast round  Opprest with numbers and borne down they fell  Not slain nor greatly wounded Captives now  In their behalf from MAXIMIN I come  CORNELIA  O sire of gods and men eternal JOVE  For ever prais'd be thy protecting arm  OFFICER  Upon their father now depends their fate  'Tis his to grant what MAXIMIN requires  CORNELIA  Let his demands be boundless as the wish  Of avarice itself they shall be granted  Treasures there are from age to age preserv'd  The acquisition of our frugal sires  Well are the treasures of our house bestow'd  If they redeem their lives who should possess them  OFFICER  It is not gold that MAXIMIN requires  To thee AEMILIUS I address my words  Imperial MAXIMIN lord of mankind  Charges the senate and the Roman people  With breach of vows and unprovok'd rebellion  But chiefly thee who first withstood thy sovereign  And stopt the progress of his just revenge  The righteous gods he saith to thee averse  Have made thy sons the captives of his arms  Them he has doom'd to death and will this day  The sentence execute unless their father  Before the sun shall set give up the city  CORNELIA  Relentless tyrant O allseeing gods  How dire a prospect opens to CORNELIA  AEMILIUS  I stand now not in equal lists with MAXIMIN  Nor mean I here to plead the cause of Rome  'Twould but offend thine ear Yet tell thy lord  He knows AEMILIUS not and therefore wrongs him  By this unworthy trial of his faith  Unhappy most unhappy he may make me  But he and fortune cannot make me base  OFFICER  Is this the answer I must bear to MAXIMIN  AEMILIUS  What other answer could he hope from me  OFFICER  Think of the consequence of this defiance  AEMILIUS  I'll meet it when it comes now I must think  Of trust repos'd in me by injur'd Rome  OFFICER  Stout are thy words But will this pride of spirit  Sustain thee through the horrors that surround thee  Thy lips have now pronounc'd thy children's doom  Which executed as it soon must be  Will move the sternest soldier of our camp  To tender pity Never yet were seen  So brave a pair as thy unhappy sons  Nature on them has pour'd out all her gifts  And drest their virtue in the fairest form  CORNELIA  O thou whose tongue in Roman accents speaks  Whose gentle aspect shews a mind humane  Take pity on the most unhappy parents  That ever bore the name This fatal day  Has prov'd too well the worth of these my sons  Whom nature tho' they less deserv'd would love  O soften to the tyrant this refusal  I know not what to say I have no right  But that which signal misery confers  To beg from thee assistance If thou hast  At home an anxious mother or sad spouse  Who daily trembles for thy noble life  Think of her state and listen to CORNELIA  Whose tongue till now did never plead for favour  AEMILIUS  O generous stranger our misfortunes touch  Thy manly mind  OFFICER  No stranger I behold  A Roman and a friend This helmet off  Perhaps CORNELIA may remember VARUS  CORNELIA  VARUS my friend companion of my youth  O heavy change of times on other terms  In Rome delightful Rome we wont to meet  VARUS  Most true CORNELIA  CORNELIA  And is VARUS come  To aid the tyrant's arms against his country  Come the fierce herald of his kinsmen's doom  VARUS  With the same heart the same unalter'd mind  To all that e'er he lov'd is VARUS come  AEMILIUS  Permit me gallant VARUS still to claim  Thy friendship tho' I stand the tyrant's foe  VARUS  AEMILIUS fortune rules the lives of men  Had I been consul and possess'd in Rome  Of civil dignity perhaps like thee  I should have arm'd me in the senate's cause  Whilst thou a soldier on the distant frontier  Perhaps like me hadst fought thy leader's quarrel  The armies of the north acknowledge MAXIMIN  I lead the British legions to the war  But more of this hereafter Thou hast heard  My horrid message and hast made such answer  As well becomes a Roman and a consul  AEMILIUS  Barbarian as he isforgive me VARUS  He cannot mean this threat'ning to fulfil  VARUS  O trust not the humanity of MAXIMIN  If he's not cruel why art thou in arms  Besides his temper ever fierce and savage  Is now incens'd enrag'd almost to madness  By the wide was  ing havock of this day  His works are levell'd his best legions thin'd  His nephew ALGAR slain by TITUS' hand  In the first transport of his furious wrath  He did devote to the infernal gods  And ALGAR's shade the pris'ners of the field  An old Ligurian captain of his guards  Step'd in and interpos'd this crafty counsel  Your answer I will bear but give it colours  That may denote the dawning of submission  And so retard  Enter an  OFFICER  OFFICER  An herald from the camp  Requires the tribune forthwith to return  Impatient MAXIMIN stands on the plain  Known by his purple and gigantick stature  CORNELIA  Dreadful impatience most inhuman rage  By the dear sympathy of Roman blood  Which in our veins from the same fountain flows  Let me entreat thee VARUS to appease  The angry tyrant Represent AEMILIUS  Dispos'd to yield all that his honour can  And if stern MAXIMIN prefers revenge  To profer'd gold yet try if wealth can win  His friends and favourites to be more gentle  VARUS  He has no friends nor favourites from fear  His soldiers serve his officers obey  I must be gone for MAXIMIN brooks not  His orders slighted Trust my zeal CORNELIA  Had I but equal power your sons were free  Consul  AEMILIUS  Let me conduct thee to the gate  And tell thee as we go what yet remains  Untold of our condition  Exeunt  AEMILIUS  and  VARUS  CORNELIA  Interpreter of heaven's mysterious will  Angur rever'd how will the evening close  Of this distressful day Haste to repeat  The sacred rites and prove thy art divine  PRIEST  Such is my purpose soon as Phoebus bows  From his meridian height Lady my mind  Has ponder'd MAXIMIN's abhor'd demand  One only course there is to end the strife  The dreadful strife of nature and of duty  In great AEMILIUS' mind and reconcile  The children's safety with the father's honour  CORNELIA  'Tis that I wish for but of that despair  PRIEST  The Roman host by GORDIANUS led  In three days hence reach Aquileia's walls  Their near approach to MAXIMIN unknown  Therefore the consul without breach of honour  Without injustice to the Roman state  May stipulate with MAXIMIN to yield  The city on the fourth returning day  If not reliev'd E'er that the chance of war  Raises the siege or makes resistance vain  CORNELIA  Wise are thy words and now the dawn of hope  Breaks on my darksome mind Believe me priest  The loss of my dear sons in battle slain  As once I thought them was less terrible  Than the dire apprehension of that death  To which the tyrant dooms them worse to me  And worse far worse to them Alas my sons  Uncertain is your fate who can foretel  The savage motions of the tyrant's will  And yet this counsel seems the only means  Of preservation Minister of heaven  Let us retire and at the altar bow  Of JOVE eternal who thy heart inspir'd  Exeunt  End of the second Act  ACT III SCENE I  Enter  AEMILIUS  and from the other side of the stage  LUCIUS  LUCIUS  TO every post and station round the wall  Your orders have been borne And each commander  With zeal obey'd  AEMILIUS  The soldiers' countenance  How seems it LUCIUS  LUCIUS  Determin'd to the death  Strong indignation at their leader's fate  With grief and pity o'er their visage gleams  But every passion settles to revenge  AEMILIUS  LUCIUS 'tis well See that my steed be led  Accoutr'd to the gate I know not LUCIUS  How soon I may bestride him  Exit  LUCIUS  AEMILIUS  alone  This distress  Grows heavier every hour like a green wound  At first I felt it not it rankles now  Would I had listen'd to the urgent voice  Of nature when she call'd me to the field  Who could have blam'd the passions of a father  If Rome had blam'd me in the silent tomb  Her voice had not been heard  Enter  CORNELIA  CORNELIA  Why tarries VARUS  AEMILIUS  He will return CORNELIA doubt not that  The tyrant knows the snare in which we're caught  And to the uttermost will prove our souls  Before he breaks it  CORNELIA  By the gods inspir'd  The priest hath found the means to set us free  If you consent  AEMILIUS  If I consent alas  That doubt implies suspicion of the means  CORNELIA  Hear me and judge capitulate with MAXIMIN  In three days hence to yield up Aquileia  If not reliev'd Before that time expires  The arms of Rome victorious raise the siege  Or if defeated make resistance vain  Bend not thine eye AEMILIUS on the ground  The strictest law of duty is fulfill'd  If thou reject'st this counsel I will say  Not MAXIMIN the tyrant slew my children  But their own cruel father  AEMILIUS  Oh forbear  My soul is rack'd my heart asunder torn  The eyes of all the world on me are fix'd  Rome and mankind from me expect their fate  I must consider this applauded counsel  Ere I embrace  CORNELIA  This city is not Rome  Nor your small garrison the Roman host  A part a little part a very grain  Of publick interest in your mind outweighs  Your children all your children Oh AEMILIUS  Alike the father and the mother bear  The name of parent but a parent's love  Lives only in the tender mother's heart  AEMILIUS  First let us learn what answer VARUS brings  Enter  VARUS  He comes and various passions dim his face  CORNELIA  O VARUS VARUS  VARUS  Oh too just thy fears  Of my lov'd kinsmen unrevok'd the doom  VARUS hath kneel'd in vain Hard as the rocks  Of wild Dalmatia is the tyrant's heart  Incens'd at the refusal which I bore  His fury rages like a fire confin'd  And threatens every quarter Hear AEMILIUS  And tremble now for Rome as for thy children  AEMILIUS  For Rome  VARUS  The tyrant lend me patience Heaven  To speak with calmness I who serve him still  This day hath vow'd to raze imperial Rome  AEMILIUS  Barbarian why  VARUS  To fix his wavering host  To glut his legions with the mighty spoil  Disease and famine prey upon his troops  And rumour cries that a relief is near  The soldiers faint and murmur at the length  And havock of this siege The crafty tyrant  With sound of trumpet thro' the camp proclaim'd  That he will give the city to be sack'd  Raze her proud walls and change the seat of empire  The glad Barbarians shouted to the skies  And mix'd with their applause unheardof oaths  To die with MAXIMIN  AEMILIUS  What said the Romans  VARUS  In number few but scatter'd thro' the bands  They griev'd and carefully supprest their sorrow  AEMILIUS  Was there no Roman near enough to plant  A dagger in the heart of MAXIMIN  VARUS  Before the tyrant reach the walls of Rome  That Roman may be found  AEMILIUS  Above the name  Of godlike SCAEVOLA his fame shall rise  VARUS  The righteous gods whom MAXIMIN contemns  Have in their vengeance urg'd his frantic mind  By this decree to work his own perdition  Long honour'd Rome tho' thou hast lost so much  Of thy primaeval splendor still my heart  Thy image worships still for thee I fought  And from Siluria to the savage shore  Of Caledonia I thy trophies rear'd  And shall thy soldier draw his sword against thee  Or stand a tame spectator of thy fall  No I am thine devoted as of old  Thy darling sons when first thy glory rose  Nor shall thy turrets bow imperial Rome  Till low in dust the head of VARUS lies  AEMILIUS  There spoke a Roman  CORNELIA  I rejoice to hear▪  The voice of VARUS thus declare for Rome  Her distant danger may thy arm avert  But who defends my sons whose sudden fate  This day decides  VARUS  O were it possible  To gain a short delay Time presses me  For strong in troops and terrible is MAXIMIN  Nor am I yet prepar'd to rise in arms  In a few daysnay if the Roman host  Were near at hand  CORNELIA  My husband speak  AEMILIUS  O VARUS  The fates are merciful Peruse these lines  VARUS  "In three days hence" Then tyrant I shall meet thee  But what can sheath this day the naked sword  AEMILIUS  A truce I'll offer bind myself by vow  Nor is the practice new or strange in war  Within a certain time to yield the city  If not reliev'd the time this scroll directs  The fourth revolving day  VARUS  I see their aim  Ere that the blow is struck by GORDIANUS  Ere that shall VARUS spread his Roman eagle  And chace the raven of Dalmatia home  AEMILIUS  Thou think'st the tyrant will accept those terms  VARUS  I hold it certain he can wish no more  Unknown to him th' approach of GORDIANUS  By MARS the father of the Roman race  Whose spear omnipotent in battle rules  My life shall stand betwixt your sons and death  CORNELIA  O best of friends This is the work of heaven  Whose awful purposes unconscious man  Promotes and fondly thinks he serves his own  Thus from remotest Britain's frozen shore  The tyrant to his aid the warrior calls  Who comes a Weapon in the hand of JOVE  To smite the proud usurper and preserve  My children  AEMILIUS  Yea his country and mankind  VARUS  May the event these pleasing hopes fulfil  I that have been a soldier from my youth  And fought out many a hard unequal conflict  With tribes and nations who no mercy know  Yet never felt my bosom thus alarm'd  AEMILIUS  For us for Rome thy Roman mind is mov'd  VARUS  In a new path I tread I that ne'er us'd  Dissimulation must a while dissemble  Soon may the hour of nobler action come  When in the front of my brave troops I stand  And dare the hateful tyrant with my sword  My heart shall beat no more My friends farewel  CORNELIA  The gods protect thee VARUS  VARUS  Consul 'tis meet  You hold your troops prepar'd and from the walls  Each motion watch that rises in our camp  AEMILIUS  My vigilance shall equal the occasion  Exit  VARUS  'Tis as thou said'st indeed the hand of heaven  Ye powers supreme who guide the line of fate  Whose winding course eludes the sense of man  Who could have thought that from our deep distress  My son's captivity and threaten'd death  Should spring the ruin of insulting MAXIMIN  CORNELIA  Him who contemns the gods the gods will punish  Now or hereafter To the altar I  Of JOVE will hasten and his power implore  Here LUCIUS comes  Enter  LUCIUS  AEMILIUS  What tidings  LUCIUS  Good my lord  Far on the distant heights that close the vale  The watchmen have descried a welcome sight  Eagles and standards glittering in the sun  Squadrons of horse that move along the hill  Your faithful soldiers in loud shouts rejoice  And hail the van of GORDIANUS' host  AEMILIUS  Too soon great gods they come  LUCIUS  Too soon my lord  That cannot be In a most happy hour  Relief approaches For in every street  Th' afflicted citizens exclaim against you  And as they pass upbraid the patient soldier  For tame submission to your rigid will  Which even your children's danger cannot bend  AEMILIUS  Would to the gods their murmurs and reproaches  Were all I had to bear  Enter a Herald and an Officer from  MAXIMIN  Now bursts the storm  CORNELIA  This is not VARUS Sternly he comes on  This is the dreadful harbinger of death  OFFICER  Consul I come from MAXIMIN that prince  Whose wrath is terrible now burns with wrath  At thee and sends me to denounce his vengeance  He hath discover'd thy unworthy arts  The fraudulent proposal of a truce  When thou did'st know the rebel host drew near  Hither I come to cut all treaties short  And to pronounce thy son's immediate death  Unless without delay thou yield'st this city  Thyself thy legions freely to his mercy  AEMILIUS  A cruel message harshly thou deliver'st  The dreadful echo of thy threat'ning lord  He grows in his demands  OFFICER  'Tis fit he should  When basely dealt with treachery still finds  Its due reward from him  AEMILIUS  Ha who art thou  Who dar'st presume thus to address the consul  OFFICER  I am the slave of MAXIMIN if thou  Hast any other name it is a worse one  Rebel proud Roman  AEMILIUS  Thou'rt protected slave  Thy character is sacred elseBarbarian  Return to MAXIMIN the terms I sent  By VARUS I adhere to and expect  another answer by a gentler herald  CORNELIA  Thou art no Roman Wilt thou deign to tell  Thy name and country  OFFICER  DUMNORIX my name  My country Gaul  CORNELIA  And of Ligurian race  Chief of the band Pretorian art thou not  OFFICER  I am and faithful to the prince I serve  CORNELIA  Faithful to evil false to all that's good  To nature and humanity a traitor  Contriver of the murder of my children  My soul by strong antipathy divin'd thee  And shudder'd at thee as her evil genius  AEMILIUS  CORNELIA beware thou wrong'st thyself  Thus to expose to him thy wounded heart  OFFICER  VARUS your countryman hath told you lady  What counsel I suggested to my prince  This I expected from a Roman messenger  Whose treachery his master soon shall know  He told you true From me the counsel came  I thought the dames of Rome had lov'd their children  Exit  DUMNORIX  CORNELIA  Oh my husband What remedy what hope  AEMILIUS  In VARUS still I trust The troops of Rome  Are near at hand That insolent Ligurian  Hath chaf'd me to the height O awful Rome  Where are thy honours Queen of all the earth  How art thou fallen When a vile slave like this  Insults thy consul and decrees the doom  Of thy Patrician race If this must be  'Tis time to die we all have liv'd too long  CORNELIA  I felt the insult but my feeble anger  Blaz'd for a moment only Other passions  Soon quench'd my indignation O my children  Enter an  OFFICER  OFFICER  To arms my lord The enemy comes on  AEMILIUS  We are prepar'd for MAXIMIN is known  I look'd for this attack Against what gate  Bend they their force  OFFICER  They threaten every gate  For all their legions move Distinct I saw  Three mighty columns shoaling to the plain  And in their front are carriages advanc'd  Loaded with beams and rafters fit to frame  Some engine strong against our batter'd walls  AEMILIUS  Be not afraid  To  CORNELIA  A shout  What means that fearful cry  CORNELIA  A cry it was a groan a dreadful groan  As if a multitude a legion died  AEMILIUS  Farewel  CORNELIA  My lord one moment stay behold  Enter  LUCIUS  AEMILIUS  From whence that dismal cry  OFFICER  Alas alas  It was the people's voice the soldiers voice  Lamenting for your sons  CORNELIA  Already heaven  AEMILIUS  Say what has befallen  OFFICER  Still my lord they live  But on the verge of death the brothers stand  CORNELIA  Still they live  AEMILIUS  Uninterrupted now relate  Without a comment what thy eyes have seen  OFFICER  The host of MAXIMIN for fight array'd  In three huge columns onward slowly mov'd  And when their van had reach'd the little hill  From whence the fountain springs fast by the wall  The army halted then appear'd a band  Busy artificers who rear'd in haste  A pile we wonder'd at but soon was chang'd  Our wonder into sorrow when we knew  It was a scaffold and beheld your sons  Guarded and bound draw near That spectacle  Produc'd the cry  CORNELIA  O insupportable  My lord my husband oh  AEMILIUS  Matron retire  And hide thy anguish from the common eye  CORNELIA  Ha Whither dost thou go  AEMILIUS  Streight to the gate  CORNELIA  Where thou art I will be I cannot leave thee  Have mercy upon me your sons yourself  And to necessity a little yield  Intreat a short delay new terms propound  Let not your children die  AEMILIUS  Think'st thou thy sons  Will chuse a life bought by their father's shame  If right my soul divines of both my boys  What they dread most this instant is to live  Redeem'd inglorious with my honour lost  CORNELIA  I am encompassed on a pointed rock  I stand a dreadful gulph on either side  AEMILIUS  The time is not expir'd some hours the sun  Hath yet to fall this awful preparation  Is meant to terrify and shake my soul  That I may bow before the next demand  Go to the palace when a message comes  From the fell tyrant thou shalt hear it answered  CORNELIA  Deal not my lord deceitfully with me  I have a right a mother's right  AEMILIUS  Be calm  Let me conjure thee by the sacred names  Of thy great ancestors who died for Rome  Remember them and prove thyself their daughter  Exit  AEMILIUS  CORNELIA  alone  My ancestors alas illomen'd names  Ye shades of heroes o'er the world renown'd  For virtue and for great misfortunes fam'd  Why should I think of you but to confirm  The dire presage that rises from my heart  Your matchless worth exempted not from ills  But was the cause recorded of your ruin  Sprung from your blood I fear that I am born  Heir to the fortunes of the fated line  Exit  CORNELIA  End of the third  ACT  ACT IV SCENE I  Enter  LUCIUS  I Will report the truth too visible  Is the sad object from our crowded walls  Unhappy mother whom excess of anguish  Drives to pursue additional distress  O good and great AEMILIUS how my soul  Is griev'd for thee and for thy valiant sons  Whom I so oft have carried in my arms  My generous master made me free in vain  Still I remain'd a voluntary slave  Prefer'd his service in a foreign land  To sweet LARISSA and my nativeshore  My only son under his roof brought forth  Born on the day that gave young TITUS birth  Bred up with him in every Roman art  Unlike the rudeness of our simple land  Wild with despair vows he will not outlive  His dear dear lord his kind his noble master  Enter  CORNELIA  CORNELIA  Calamity comes on me like a torrent  And overwhelms a mind not us'd to woe  Ha LUCIUS hast thou seen my hapless sons  Say can I view them from th' adjacent wall  LUCIUS  Too well alas conspicuous they stand  CORNELIA  LUCIUS lead on  LUCIUS  Reluctant I obey  I fear the transports of a mother's mind  CORNELIA  I will behold them I will see my children  Whate'er befal me I will gaze upon them  Tho' frantic madness should my soul surprise  All lesser fears are in a greater lost  Haste and conduct me  LUCIUS  The sad spectacle  Is near at hand  CORNELIA  O feeble limbs that fail  And weakly serve the strength of my despair  LUCIUS  'Tis nature shrinks O lady yet be warn'd  CORNELIA  No if my wretched limbs refuse their office  The arms of slaves shall bear me to the wall  I'm firmer now proceed  LUCIUS  The herald comes  CORNELIA  The last of heralds but I will not tarry  Exeunt  CORNELIA  and  LUCIUS  Enter Herald and  VARUS  This is the place appointed by the consul  Find and inform him quickly of my presence  Exit Herald  VARUS  alone  They must not die It were a deed to strike  Horror from pole to pole The Parthian fierce  And the wild Moor would tremble at the tale  And mark accurst the pale of Roman empire  Tyrant too savage over beasts to rule  Fidelity to thee were horrid treason  To human nature to the gracious gods  Who o'er distrest humanity preside  This day has full display'd the tyrant's soul  And ripen'd thoughts long growing in my breast  Tis vain to think of antient freedom now  The senate and the people are no more  Rome's vast dominions for the scepter call  The world subdu'd one master must command  But let us have a monarch not a tyrant  Enter  AEMILIUS  AEMILIUS  VARUS return'd can MAXIMIN relent  VARUS  Never his rage would stab the hoary Priest  Before the altar Hardly have I gain'd  This last renewal of the first conditions  AEMILIUS  Where is the host of Rome  VARUS  Far distant still  Those squadrons that in evil hour alarm'd  The tyrant and defeated our design  The zeal of GORDIANUS had advanced  To chear your troops with promise of relief  AEMILIUS  'Tis fate o'erwhelms us To the tyrant bear  My first and latest answer With delight  With transport I would die to save my sons  But will not save them by an act of baseness  VARUS  With fortitude with dignity AEMILIUS  Thou hast sustain'd this cruel shock of fortune  And justify'd the sentiments of Rome  That plac'd her sovereign confidence in thee  Now hear the counsel of a faithful friend  Anxious for thee and zealous for his country  AEMILIUS  No vain desire of glory rules my breast  I feel the throbs of nature all I wish  Is to be just to Rome I envy not  Nor emulate the older Brutus' fame  VARUS  The profer'd terms accept and save thy children  Rome shall not suffer when her troops draw near  I will forsake the tyrant's shatter'd side  And fix the fortune of the future field  AEMILIUS  Compassion dictates this delusive counsel  Thy pity for a miserable father  But chance may marr thy generous design  And deep dismay for Aquileia lost  Confound the legions that contend for Rome  Then whither shall forlorn AEMILIUS fly  Where shall he hide him from reproach and shame  What joy what comfort will his children yield  When he and they with infamy must dwell  A new companion to our noble race  No rather let the blow tremendous fall  And crush us in the path our fathers trod  I see the image of my bleeding country  I hear the voice of Rome her consul call  The chosen guardian in her last extreme  City of gods mother of heroes fam'd  Like gods of old shall I abandon thee  Eor whom so many noble youths have died  So many fathers  Enter  CORNELIA  Now my heart be firm  CORNELIA  Where is AEMILIUS the hardhearted father  Who whets the tyrant's sword against his children  AEMILIUS  Alas CORNELIA  CORNELIA  I have seen my sons  Both bound with chains I saw the deadly ax  And the stern villain standing by their side  Consul I kneel to thee O hear thy wife  Hear me my husband whilst I yet have sense  And reason left to regulate my words  O drive me not to madness to despair  Already wavering on the brink I stand  In agony extreme  AEMILIUS  Trust in the gods  They sooth the agonies of guiltless woe  But to despair resign the selfcondemn'd  O my beloved wife do not assail  Thy husband's soul that labours to be just  Heaven knows how dear to my afflicted heart  Thou and the pledges of our virtuous love  Have ever been more dear than ever now  But if their danger and thy fears should bend  My yielding mind to baseness and to shame  Remorse would break the concord of our love  And hate succeed to criminal affection  CORNELIA  Me only hate acquit thy noble sons  Too like thyself AEMILIUS had'st thou seen  Thy sons as I beheld them from the ramparts  With head erect and high my PAULUS stood  I knew his stature eminent unmov'd  And stedfast was his gesture firm he seem'd  Like a strong castle on its rocky base  The port of TITUS shew'd a mind less calm  Around he look'd and from his scornful eyes  Threw on his foes defiance and disdain  At last in earnest speech the brothers join'd  I saw them whisper PAULUS bow'd his head  The multitude long silent at my presence  Lamented then the weeping mothers clasp'd  Their infants to their breasts and look'd at me  I left the walls to find thee out my husband  And lead thee thither that thou might'st relent  AEMILIUS  Relent CORNELIA O eternal powers  That see the anguish of my tortur'd soul  Sustain me still let not my duty yield  To the strong yearning of a father's heart  CORNELIA  Why speaks not VARUS Has he too conspir'd  Against me and my children  VARUS  I have spoke  And told the consul that his sons may live  And Roman arms o'er MAXIMIN prevail  CORNELIA  What would'st thou more inexorable man  VARUS  I see the bottom of thy troubled mind  And in this awful hour revere thy virtue  Which stands aloof and trembles at dishonour  But hear this new addition to my counsel  Soldiers I have in every danger try'd  Bred to hard service in our British wars  Accustom'd to explore the forests wild  Alone amidst the perils of the night  And mingle fearless with the savage foes  Disguis'd in their attire and uncouth arms  Of those the most expert I will dispatch  That GORDIANUS may his arms advance  Enter an  OFFICER  OFFICER  My Lord your son approaches  CORNELIA  Ha my son  OFFICER  TITUS your son attended by a herald  Slow thro' the gazing multitude proceeds  Who weep and bless him  AEMILIUS  Ha what change is this  OFFICER  The herald as he passes scatters gladness  Saying that TITUS comes to end the war  And to compassion move his father's mind  AEMILIUS  TITUS does TITUS come to plead compassion  Now destiny thou tramplest down AEMILIUS  Go tell him Herald that I will not see him  Let him not come to hear me curse the hour  That made me father of a son like him  CORNELIA  Judge not so rashly see and hear thy son  AEMILIUS  Mention him not that father has my envy▪  Who mourneth o'er his sons in battle slain  Shortsighted mortals Let no man repine  When fate bereaves him of the child he loves  Amidst his anguish let him think of mine  And that will comfort him  CORNELIA  This is not well  Nor like my son yet valour cannot change  Its quality so quickly He hath prov'd  His dauntless courage Death in terror clad  Could not dismay him But his noble mind  Is sway'd by pity of his brother's fate  In his involv'd  Enter  TITUS  AEMILIUS  Gods unabash'd he seems  Nor at his most inglorious purpose blushes  AEMILIUS  turns from him  CORNELIA  Dear to thy mother still  TITUS  To his father  Turn not away  Nor hold thy TITUS of one look unworthy  AEMILIUS  Art thou my TITUS Thou that fear'st to die  And comes a servile suppliant for life  With coward prayers to seduce the consul  No thou art not my son I had a son  Whose only fault was valour to excess  Whose fatal courage was the source of ills  Which he was bound in honour to sustain  Thou art not he Thou scandal to thy country  Thou tool of MAXIMIN  TITUS  Wrong not thy son  Fast roll the number'd moments of my life  And I must hasten to redeem my fame  CORNELIA  I fear but know not what his words portend  TITUS  I have deceiv'd the tyrant and am come  No messenger or counsellor of shame  The cause of honour of my father's honour  The cause of Rome against myself I plead  And in my voice the noble PAULUS speaks  Let no man pity us aloft we stand  On a high theatre objects I think  Of admiration and of envy rather  The tyrant and his menac'd deaths we scorn  The chearful victims of our sacred country  AEMILIUS  Hear this O earth and heaven my son my pride  Come to thy father's arms now now I know  My blood again O bitter pleasing hour  For I must lose thee lose thee O my hero  Now when I love thee best and most admire  CORNELIA  Preserve that virtue which you thus admire  My son my husband VARUS pity me  TITUS  This to prevent I came the force I fear'd  Of strong affection and a mother's tears  We saw the busy heralds come and go  And trembled lest the consul might be won  For ebbing resolution ne'er returns  But still falls farther from its former shore  To aid my father in this trying hour  Did I assume a dastard's vile disguise  AEMILIUS  And did I meet thee with reproach and anger  With scorn encounter my devoted son  Who came to strengthen and support his sire  Forgive me last of the Aemilian line  Pure and unstain'd the current of our blood  Ends as it long hsa flow'd  CORNELIA  O VARUS speak  Tell them thou guardian angel of thy country  That Rome does not this sacrifice demand  Why should they die in vain  VARUS  Thou noble youth  Whose life more and more precious still I deem  I am the friend of Rome of yonder host  No slender part under my ensigns move  With them I watch the tyrant's overthrow  And guard my country with a stronger power  Than Aquileia and her feeble walls  Great is thy glory thou hast reach'd the top  Of magnanimity in bloom of youth  The REGULUS reviv'd of antient Rome  Inflexible to terror yield to prudence  No tongueshall tax thine or thy father's fame  TITUS  Renowned VARUS often have I heard  Of thee and of thy virtues oft rejoic'd  That I could claim affinity with them  But not the sanction of thy honour'd voice  Not all the credence due to worth like thine  Can move my stedfast mind There is but one  One only path which mortals safely tread  The sacred path of rectitude and truth  I follow tho' it leads me to the tomb  Forgive me noble Roman o'er thy head  Perhaps this instant dire discovery hangs  And thou and Rome are lost and basely lost  No let the consul as he ought defy  The tyrant's threat'ning and rely on heav'n  For me and PAULUS too our hearts are fix'd  Deliberation of our state is vain  For if the consul should this city yield  Inevitable death abides his sons  CORNELIA  Eternal Gods thy mystic words explain  TITUS  A solemn oath determin'd we have sworn  Ne'er to survive the ignominious ransom  Restor'd to liberty to death we fly  And perish mutual by each other's sword  AEMILIUS  Immortal Gods who gave me sons like these  Forsake them not but guard your work divine  CORNELIA  My bestbelov'd my darling my sond heart  Bleeds tenderness for thee But there is something  So awful and so great a glory round thee  Which dazzles and o'erwhelms me O my son  Is life a burden Lov'st thou not thy parents  Who for the love of thee would gladly die  TITUS  Think not O best of mothers best of women  That with unfilial arrogance I speak  My heart is full this instant of affection  Hard to suppress Dear to my soul are those  I leave behind bitter to me their sorrows  But destiny supreme hath mark'd my way  And I accept what honour cannot shun  By trivial accident by various ills  Fatal to man thou might'st have lost thy sons  And they in dark oblivion would have slept  But now I see the goal that JOVE assigns  And glory terminates our short career  Be this thy comfort I avow it mine  Admir'd and mourn'd by Rome for Rome we die  Of fate secure immortal is our fame  And spotless laurels deck thy childrens tomb  CORNELIA  Mysterious Powers how strange is my distress  Thy virtue TITUS rends thy mother's heart  Ev'n now the grandeur of thy tow'ring soul  Exalts my humbler mind to thoughts like thine  But when thou goest alas I sink again  Like the weak Pythian when her God has left her  TITUS  My father  AEMILIUS  O my son thou art the judge  And arbiter of fate Time rapid fly  And bring a joyful victory to Rome  Let me but see the scale of combat turn'd  And die in glad assurance of her fafety  VARUS  The hero's fire invades my secret soul  Like his my bosom burns You shall not die  To  TITUS  Unaided and alone Perhaps the Gods  I know not that but I will raise a pile  Of glorious ruin Shine ye stars of Rome  First in the column stand my British bands  To  AEMILIUS  Prepare your squadrons and protract the time  Of his return  Enter  PRIEST  of  JUPITER  and the younger  LUCIUS  PRIEST  Consul of mighty Rome  Firm be the purpose of the present hour  The sire of Gods a happy sign hath giv'n  Trust in the aid of heav'n's eternal king  His adamantine ages JOVE extends  VARUS  Romans and friends farewell Undaunted TITUS  I go to aid thee too with mortal arms  Exit  VARUS  TITUS  Deem me not impious servant of the Gods  Thee and thy sacred office I revere  But signs and omens may our thoughts deceive  Men may mistake the purposes of heav'n  The shield of JOVE guards not the brave man's life  Nor wards his body from the mortal blow  A shield there is that never can be pierc'd  The heav'nly armour of a mind resolv'd  That mail who wears against all force is clad  And triumphs o'er the fate by which he falls  Enter  OFFICER  OFFICER  My Lords th' assembled citizens demand  An audience  AEMILIUS  Tell them No It will require  My presence to appease their fearful clamour  Retire my son and till the herald comes  A sad but dear society enjoy  Exeunt  End of the fourth Act  ACT V SCENE I  The Trumpets sound  Enter  TITUS CORNELIA  and  AEMILIUS  TITUS  FOR me the trumpet sounds  CORNELIA  O dreadful sound  TITUS  The hour is come  CORNELIA  Alas not yet my son  To the last moment stay So VARUS counsell'd  TITUS  The herald's at the gate I must not stay  Nor linger like a criminal opprest  With shameful fears Farewell my sire farewell  CORNELIA  Thou goest to die and say'st thou but farewell  It were too little if from Rome thou went'st  A sportful journey to the Baian shore  But thou art going never to return  To the dark region  TITUS  Where all men have gone  Where all must go but glorious is the path  Thy offspring tread An honourable death  Is the sole gift which fate cannot resume  Methinks it suits us not thus to discourse  Combat thy grief and make our parting noble  CORNELIA  Nature forbids I cannot conquer nature  Speak not so firm look not so unconcern'd  Leave in thy mother's ear some tender words  Fit for eternal memory  TITUS  If thou lov'st  O spare thy son lest MAXIMIN should think  He has subdued me No He shall not see  Upon my cheek the vestige of a tear  AEMILIUS  Thy spirit shall inspire thy father's soul  Till to the shades he sinks to meet thee there  Then to the founders of immortal Rome  I'll point my heroesTo my PAULUS this  Embraces  And now farewell  CORNELIA  Alas thy fire despairs  He quits thy hand

lustre more  Enter  LUCIUS  LUCIUS  Strife and confusion  Reign in the tyrant's camp Himself I saw  Leap from his high tribunal  AEMILIUS  Sound th' alarm  This is the work of VARUS  TITUS  Consul beware  Hostility from thee is breach of faith  Whilst I remain  AEMILIUS  Too true my son Begone  And free thy father's sword  CORNELIA  Embraces him  He shall not go  One instant saves him keeps him from the storm  My arms have strength enough to hold my son  My only left for now his brother dies  TITUS  Nothing shall hold me I have deeply sworn  And left my brother pledge of my return  Left him to bear alone the tyrant's rage  To die by torture if I break my faith  Thus would'st thou buy my life Unhand me streight  Or I must tear myself  AEMILIUS  Thy frenzy woman  Cuts off our last resource adds shame to ruin  I will not cannot succour noble VARUS  And much wrong'd PAULUS till thou sett'st him free  The clamour ceases Oh what hast thou done  CORNELIA  There let him go and perish with his brother  Forgive this action for excess of anguish  Deprives CORNELIA of her reason's aid  Now comes the raven that still bodes my woes  Enter Herald and  DUMNORIX  DUMNORIX  Captive the time's

alarm provokes thee to the field  One fate abides the children and their fire  Tyrannic fortune when thou raisest up  To envy'd eminence the sons of men  Thou but prepar'st a triumph for thyself  A second triumph from their grievous fall  Alike the column and its ruins mark  Thy sovereign sway Now LUCIUS will obey  Thy orders lord then hasten to thy side  The humble shrub shall with the cedar fall  CORNELIA  behind the Scene  CORNLLIA  Stand off  LUCIUS  CORNELIA'S voice it sounds of woe▪  Enter  CORNELIA  followed by her woman  CORNELIA  Stand off I say and let me find my husband  Fit mate for me for me whose eyes have seen  The murder of my child  LUCIUS  Alas alas  The blow at last hath fall'n  CORNELIA  His streaming bood  I saw  LUCIUS  His blood whom has the tyrant spar'd  CORNELIA  None LUCIUS none I tarry'd not to see  A second stroke O lead me to my husband  LUCIUS  He guards the gate  Sound of trumpets  But hark his trumpets sound  And sound a charge Lady my son went forth  To rouse the British legions to defend  Their leader and thy sons That sound proclaims  Tumult and war are up My lord is there  Exit  Manent  CORNELIA  and attendants  CORNELIA  The frantic father rushes to revenge  His sons or throw the load of life away  The desolate CORNELIA she remains  Her children murder'd and her husband slain  Enter  PRIEST  Where are thy omens thy predictions too  Thou priest of falshood  PRIEST  Know 'twas VARUS fell  And not thy son his fall the signal prov'd  Of instant battle With a whirlwind's rage  His legions rush'd upon the tyrant's guard  Thy valiant sons are free and lead the fight  CORNELIA  Can this be truth Shall I again believe  And wake me from the dreadful dream of death  That had possess'd my soul  PRIEST  Matron thy sons  Thy husband too victorious shall return  I saw the bird of JOVE his wings extend  And hover o'er their battle still he bears  Upon his pinions conquest  CORNELIA  Say'st thou so  Then heaven and thou forgive me JOVE supreme  If I have ought offended on my head  On mine alone let all thy wrath descend  But spare my sons and spare their blameless sire  Enter  LUCIUS  LUCIUS  Lady rejoice the tyrant is no more  His barbarous cohorts yield  CORNELIA  Blest be thy tongue  But tell me of my sons and of their father  LUCIUS  With voice and hand they urge the fainting foe  Whose courage with their furious leader died  Long like a mound against the raging main  Stood MAXIMIN the bulwark of his host  His strength defied the fury of the storm  Till to the van resistless TITUS came  By TITUS' noble arm the giant fell  And o'er him rush'd the war  CORNELIA  Not without crush  And havock round him such a ruin fell  O minister of heaven why dost thou bend  Thine eye on empty space and gaze on air  Can'st thou descry the future or perceive  Events accomplish'd tho' unknown  PRIEST  'Tis done  The weary sisters rest CYLLENIUScomes  Like a bright meteor streaming down the vault  Of azure heaven in his right hand the rod  And in his left a laurel dropping blood  Behold  Enter  AEMILIUS  attended  CORNELIA  My husband oh Where hast thou left  Thy sons  AEMILIUS  They come victorious from the field  CORNELIA  Why dost thou faintly speak such welcome tidings  Thou art not wounded  AEMILIUS  No  CORNELIA  From whence that cloud  Which overcasts thy brow What damps thy joy  Tell me AEMILIUS for I read thy soul  There indivulg'd some cruel evil lies  AEMILIUS  Alas  CORNELIA  Thou sigh'st not thus for VARUS lost  My sons thou say'st draw near what is the grief  That wrings thy heart  AEMILIUS  O summon to thine aid  What constancy thou hast soon shalt thou see  What I would not relate  CORNELIA  Ha am I mock'd  With false reports  What spectacle is this  Enter  TITUS  wounded and supported by  PAULUS  and soldiers  Are these the victors oh my TITUS dies  TITUS  I stood the chance of war Do not bewail  A fate so far above my highest hope  When last we parted Men are born to die  CORNELIA  But not like thee in youth untimely slain  TITUS  This active day has been an age of life  Rome is deliver'd Thou hast still a son  Why mourns my brother o'er a soldier's fall  PAULUS  I griev'd not TITUS when our lot was equal  CORNELIA  There will be wars again to snatch thee too  Fear not too long a life the useless live  The vile the odious thy desert is death  TITUS  My limbs grow weak upon the earth I'll rest  Have I redeem'd my rashness O my father  AEMILIUS  'Tis scarce a blemish to be brave to rashness  To thee Rome owes her safety her existence  And with her chief deliverers ranks thy name  TITUS  I feel my father's praise now when the hand  Of death comes near my heart  CORNELIA  I will be calm  O let me not disturb his parting soul  Sustain me mighty gods  TITUS  To sooth her grief  My PAULUS be thy care My last request  My father hear O comfort that good man  His son before me rushing in his breast  Receiv'd a javelin that was aim'd at mine  Cherish his age  Dies  AEMILIUS  Thou Roman to the height  Of Roman virtue to lament for thee  With common wailings were a feeble part  And far beneath the spirit of thy fall  Unworthy of thy father  PAULUS  From this place  Let me persuade my mother to retire  CORNELIA  I must behold the dead Fear not excess  Nor vehemence from me Those features wear  A look of triumph Yes thy mother's heart  Amidst her anguish at that look revives  The cruel fate thy generous mind embrac'd  Thou hast escap'd to meet the death thou lov'd'st  In arms victorious o'er thy prostrate foe  Now to the place where I will dwell with grief  And ever listen to my heroe's praise  Exit  CORNELIA  with  PAULUS  PRIEST  He fell not till each omen was accomplish'd  Himself his brother and his country free  No height beyond the summit where he stood  On earth remain'd that he might ne'er descend  The gods could only grant a death like his  AEMILIUS  Hence to the forum bear the noble corpse  And let the musick of the legions sound  A warlike symphony whose strains express  Our mingled state of triumph and of sorrow  Exeunt omnes  EPILOGUE  Spoken by Mrs CIBBER  OUR Author as I'm told is not to seek  In antient Lore in Latin nor in Greek  I therefore did advise him as a friend  To make his learning serve some useful end  And let me know what rules he had observ'd  What unities of time and place preserv'd  He answer'd Poetry is not an art  'Tis nature only frames the poet's heart  Still as he thinks the scene he feels along  And from his bosom bursts the raptur'd song  This is the sacred oracle the shrine  The bard consults and here the tuneful Nine  With the same fire the hearer's soul must glow  Else vain to him the tale of tragick woe  There is a temper which is all and all  That sounds responsive to the poet's call  Like Memnon's harp which pour'd harmonious lays  Whene'er its strings were touch'd by Phoebus' rays  This temper of the soul is sweet and wild  It sobs or smiles as sudden as a child  To woes imagin'd tears unfeigned gives  And in the poet's world of fancy lives  Whilst thus he spoke a bell was heard to ring  He stop'd and started like a guilty thing  Ere the dread curtain rose in haste withdrew  And at a distance wails his doom from you  FINIS
