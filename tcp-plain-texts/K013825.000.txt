 THE SPANISH DESCENT A POEM  By the Author of  The TrueBorn Englishman    LONDON  Printed in the Year  THE SPANISH DESCENT A POEM  LOng had this Nation been amus'd in vain  With Posts from  Portugal  and News from  Spain    With  Ord  's Conquests and the Fleets Success  And Favours from the  Moors  at  Maccaness    The Learned  Mob  bought Compasses and Scales  And every Barber knew the  Bay  of  Cales    Show'd us the Army here and there the Fleet  Here the Troops Land and there the Foes Retreat  There at St  Maries  how the Spaniard runs  and listen close as if they heard the Guns  And some pretend they see themthe Nuns  Others describe the Castle and  Puntalls    And tell how easie 'tis to Conquer  Cales    Wisely propose to let the Silver come  And help to Pay the Nation's Debts at Home  But still they count the Spoils without the Cost  And still the News came faster than the Post  The graver Heads like Mountebanks of State  Of Abdication and Revolts Debate  Expect a Revolution should appear  As Cheap and Easie as it had done here  Bring the revolting  Grandees  to the Coast  And give the Duke  D' Anjou  up for Lost  Doom him to  France  to seek Relief in vain  And send the Duke of  Austria  to  Spain    Canvas the Council at  Madrid  and find  How all the Spanish Courtiers stand enclin'd  Describe the strange Convulsions of the State  And Old  Carreroe  's Sacrific'd to Fate  Then all the Stage of Action they Survey  And wish our Generals knew as much as they  Some have their Fancies so exceeding Bold  They saw the Queens fall out and heard 'em Scold  Nor is the thing so strange for if they did  'Twas Talking from  Toledo  to  Madrid    And now the Farce is acting o'er again  The meaning of our Mischiefs to Explain  The Learned  Mob c'erread  in Arms and Law  The Cause of their Miscarriages foresaw  Tell us the Loitering Minutes were misspent  Too long a going and too few that went  Exalt the Catalonian Garrison  The New made Works the Platform and the  Town    Tell us it was Impossible to Land  And all their Batteries sunk into the Sand  Some are all Banter and the Voyage Despise  For fruitless Actions seldom pass for Wise  Tell us 'twas like our  English  Politicks  To think to wheedle  Spain  with  Hereticks    The disproportion'd Force they Banter too  The Ships too many and the Men too few  Then they find fault with Conduct and condemn  Sometimes the Officers sometimes the Men  Nor scapes his Grace the  Satyr  of the  Town    Whoever fails Success shall fail Renown  Sir  George  comes in among the Indiscreet  Sometimes the Armies censur'd then the Fleet  How the abandon'd  Country  they destroy'd  And made their early Declarations void  Too hasty Proofs of their Protection gave  Plundering the People they came there to Save  As if the  Spaniards  were so plagu'd with  France    To fly to Thieves for their Deliverance  But amongst all the Wisdom of the  Town    The vast Designs of Fate remains unknown  Unguest at unexpected hid from Thoughts  For no Man look'd for Blessings in our Faults  Mischances sometimes are a Nation's Good  Rightly Improv'd and Nicely Understood  Ten Years we felt the Dying Pangs of War  And fetch'd our Grief and Miseries from far  Our  English  Millions Foreign War maintains  And  English  Blood has Drencht the Neighbouring Plains  Nor shall we Blush to Boast what all Men own  Uncommon  English  Valour has been shown  The forward Courage of our  Ill Paid Men    Deserves more Praise than Nature spares my Pen  What cou'd they not Perform or what Endure  Witness the Mighty Bastions of  Namure    We fasted much and we attempted more  But ne'er cou'd come to giving Thanks before  Unless 'twas when the Fatal Strife was o're  Some secret  Achan  Curst our Enterprize  And  Israel  fled before her Enemies  Whether the Poisonous Particles were hid  In Us that Follow'd  or in Them that Led  What Fatal Charm benumb'd the Nations Sense  To struggle with Eternal Providence  Whether some Curse or else some  Perjur'd Vow    Or some strange Guilt that's expiated now  Was it the  Pilots  who ill steer'd the State  Or was it the Decisive Will of Fate  'Tis hard to tell but this too well we know  All things went backward or went on too slow  Small was the Glory of our High Success  A Tedious War and an Imperfect Peace  Peace Dearly purchas'd and which Cost us more  Great Kingdoms than we Conquer'd Towns before  Actions may miss of their deserv'd Applause  When Heaven approves the Men and not the Cause  And well contriv'd Designs miscarry when  Heaven may approve the Cause but not the Men  Here then's the Ground of our Expence of Blood  The Sword of  Gideon  's not the Sword of  God    The Mighty and the Wise are laid aside  And Victory  the Sex  has Dignified  We have bin us'd to  Female Conquests  here  And  Queens  have bin the Glory of the War  The Scene Revives with Smiles of Providence  All things Declin'd before and Prosper since  And as if ill Success had been Entail'd  The Posthume Projects are the last that fail'd  As Heaven whose Works are hid from Humane View  Would blast our Old Designs and bless our New  And now the Baffl'd Enterprize grows stale  Their Hopes decrease and juster Doubts prevail  The Unattempted  Town  Sings Victory  And scar'd with Walls and not with Men we Fly  Great Conduct in our safe Retreat we shew  And bravely Reimbark when none Pursue  The Guns the Ammunitions put on Board  And what we could not Plunder we Restor'd  And thus we Quit the  Andalusion  Shores  Drencht with the  Spanish  Wine and  Spanish  Ws  With Songs of Scorn the  Arragonians  Sing  And loud  Te Deum  make the Valleys Ring  Uncommon Joys now raise the Hopes of  Spain    And  Vigo  does their PlateFleet Entertain  The vast Galeons DeepBalasted with Ore  Safely reach Home to the  Galitian  Shore  The Double Joy spreads from  Madrid  to  Rome    The  English  Fled the Silver Fleet's come Home  From thence it reaches to the Banks of  Po    And the Loud Cannons let the  Germans  know  The ratling Volleys tell their Shortliv'd Joys  And roar  Te Deum  out in Smoak and Noise  To  Milan  next it flies on Wings of Fame  There the Young Monarch and his Heroes came  From sad  Luzara  and the  Mantuan  Walls  To seek New Dangers and to rescue  Cales    His Joy for Welcome Treasure he exprest  But grieves at his good Fortune in the rest  The Flying  English  he had wisht to stay  To Crown with Conquest One Victorious Day  The Priest in high Procession shew their Joy  And all the Arts of Eloquence Employ  To feed his Pride of fancy'd Victories  And raise his untry'd Valour to the Skies  The flattering  Courtiers  his vain Mind possess  With Airy Hopes of Conquest and Success  Prompt his young Thoughts to run on new Extreams  And Sycophantick Pride his Heart Enflames  His  Native Crime  springs up his Pulse beats high  With Thoughts of Universal Monarchy  Fancies his Foreign Enemies supprest  And Boasts too soon how he'll subdue the rest  Princes like other Men are blind to Fate  He only sees the Event who does the Cause create  From hence through  France  the Welcome Tydings fly  To mock his Ancient Sire with Mushroom Joy  Raptures possess the Ambitious Heads of  France    And Golden Hopes their new Designs advance  Now they Consult to Crush the World agen  And talk of rifling  Christendom  for Men  New Fleets new Armies and new Leagues contrive  And swallow Men and Nations up alive  Prescribe no Bounds to their Ambitious Pride  But first the Wealth and then the World Divide  Excess of Pride to Airy Madness grows  And makes Men strange Romantick things propose  The Head turns round and all the Fancy's vain  And makes the World as Giddy as the Brain  Men that Consult such Weighty Things as those  All Possible Disasters should suppose  In vain great  Princes  mighty things Invent  While Heaven retains the Power to prevent  He that to General Mischief makes Pretence  Should first know how to conquer Providence  Such strive in vain and only shew Mankind  How Tyrants cloath'd with Power are all enclin'd  Mean while our melancholy Fleet steers Home  Some griev'd for past for future Mischiefs some  Disaster swells the Blood and Spleen the Face  And ripens them for glorious Things apace  With deep Regret they turn their Eyes to  Spain    And wish they once might Visit them again  Little they dreamt that Good which Heaven prepar'd  No Merit from below no Signs from Heaven appear'd  No Hints unless from their highripen'd Spleen  And strange ungrounded Sympathy within  The silent Duke from all Misconduct Free  Alone enjoys  Calm of Honesty  Fear not  should be fairly shown  And  England  's Errors not his own  His Constant Temper's all serene and Clear  First free from Guilt and therefore free from Fear  Not so the rest for conscious Thoughts become  More restless now the nearer they come Home  The Partymaking Feuds on Board begin  For People always Quarrel when they Sin  Reflect with Shame upon the things misdone  And shift their Faults about from One to One  Prepare Excuses and compute their Friends  And dread the Fate which their Desert attends  Some wish for Storms and curse the Wind and Sails  And Dream no doubt of Gibbets and of Jayls  Imaginary Punishments appear  And suited to their secret Guilts their Fear  Their hast'ning Fate in their own Fancies Read  And few 'tis fear'd their Innocence can plead  Then their sweet Spoils to trusty Hands convey  And throw the  rifl'd Gods of Spain  away  Disgorge that Wealth they dare not entertain  And wish the Nuns  their MaidenHeads again    Dismiss their Wealth for fear of Witnesses  And purge their Coffers and their Consciences  Cursing their  Illgot Trifles  but in vain  For still the Guilt and still the Fears remain  Tell us ye Rabbies of abstruser Sense  Who jumble Fate and Fools with Providence  Is this the chosen Army this the Fleet  For which Heaven's Praises sound in every Street  Cou'd Heaven provide them one Occasion more  Who had so Ill discharg'd themselves before  That Fleet so many former Millions Lost  So little had Perform'd so much had Cost  That Fleet so often Mann'd with Knaves before  That serv'd us all the War to make us Poor  That Twice had made their fruitless Voyage to  Spain    And saw the  Streights  and  so came Home again  Our  Wooden Walls  that should Defend our Trade  And many a Witless  Wooden  Voyage ha' made  How oft have they been fitted out in Vain  Wasted our Money and destroy'd our Men  Betray'd our Merchants and expos'd their Fleets  And caus'd Eternal Murmurs in our Streets  The Nation's Genius sure prevails above  And Heaven conceals his Anger shows his Love  The Nation's Guardian Angel has prevail'd  And on her Guardian Queen new Favours has entail'd  Now let glad  Europe  in her Turn Rejoice  And Sing new Triumphs with exalted Voice  See the glad Post of Tidings wing'd with News  With suited Speed the wondring Fleet pursues  His Haste discern'd increases their Surprize  The more they wonder and the more he flies  Nor Wind nor Seas proportion'd Speed can bear  For Joy and Hope have swifter Wings than Fear  With what Surprize of Joy they meet the News  Joys that to every Vein new Spirits infuse  The wild Excess in Shouts and Cries appear  For Joys and Griefs are all irregular  Councils of War for sake of Forms they call  But Shame admits of no Disputes at all  How should they differ where no Doubt can be  But if they shou'd accept of Victory  Whether they shou'd the great Occasion take  Or baffle Heaven and double their Mistake  Whether the naked and defenceless Prize  They should accept or Heaven and that Despise  Whether they shou'd Revive their Reputation  Or sink it Twice and Twice Betray the Nation  Who dare the horrid Negative design  Who dare the Last suggest the First decline  Envy her self  for Satan's always there    And keeps his Councils with the God of War  Tho' with her swelling Spleen she seem'd to burst  Will'd the Design while the Event she Curs'd  The Word's gone out and now they spread the Main  With swelling Sails and swelling Hopes for  Spain  To double Vengeance prest wheree'er they come  Resolv'd to pay the Haughty  Spaniard  home  Resolv'd by future Conduct to atone  For all our past Mistakes and all their own  New Life springs up in every  English  Face  nd fits them all for Glorious Things apace  he Booty some Excites and some the Cause  ut more the Hope to gain their lost Applause  ager their sully'd Honour to restore  ome Anger whets some Pride and Vengeance more  The lazy Minutes now pass on too slow  ancy flies faster than the Winds can blow  patient Wishes lengthen out the Day  hey chide the loitering Winds for their delay  t Time is Nature's faithful Messenger  d brings up all we Wish as well as all we Fear  The Mists clear up and now the Scout discries  e Subject of their Hopes and Victories  The wish'd for Fleets embay'd in Harbour lye  Unfit to fight and more unfit to fly  Tr  oughout the Navy flies  Eccho'd from Shore with Terror and Surprize  Strange  wer of Noise  which at one simple sound  At once shall some Encourage some Confound  In vain the Lion tangl'd in the Snare  With Anguish roars and rends the trembling Air  'Tis vain to struggle with Almighty Fate  Vain and Impossible the weak Debate  The Mighty Booms the Forts resist in vain  The Guns with fruitless Force  in Noise  complain  See how the Troops intrepidly fall on  Wish for more Foes and think they fly too soon  With eager Fury to their Forts pursue  And think the odds of Four to One too few  The Land's first Conquer'd  and the Prize attends  Fate beckens in the Fleet to back their Friends  Despair succeeds they struggle now too late  And soon submit to their prevailing Fate  Courage is Madness when Occasion's past  Death's the securest Refuge and the last  And now the rolling Flames come threatning on  And mighty Streams of melted Gold run down  The flaming Oar down to its Center makes  To Form new Mines beneath the Oazy Lakes  Here a Galleon with Spicy Drugs enflam'd  In Odoriferous folds of Sulphur stream'd  The Gods of Old no such Oblations knew  Their Spices weak and their Perfumes but few  The frighted  Spaniards  from their Treasure fly  Loth to forsake their Wealth  but loth to Die    Here a vast Carrack flies while none pursue  Bulg'd on the Shore by her Distracted Crew  There like a mighty Mountain she appears  And groans beneath the Golden Weight she bears  Conquest perverts the Property of Friend  And makes Men Ruin what they can't Defend  Some blow their Treasure up into the Air  With all the wild Excesses of Despair  Strange Fate that War such odd Events shou'd have  Friends would destroy and Enemies would save  Others their Safety to their Wealth Prefer  And mix  some small Discretion  with their Fear  Life's the best Gift that Nature can bestow  The first that we receive the last which we forego  And he that's  vainly Prodigal of Blood    Forfeits his Sense to do his Cause no good  All Desparation's the Effect of Fear  Courage is Temper Valour can't Despair  And now the Victory's compleatly gain'd  No Ships to Conquer now no Foes remain'd  The mighty Spoils exceed whate'er was known  That Vanquish'd ever lost or Victor won  So great if Fame shall Future Times remind  They'll think she Lies and Libels all Mankind  Well may the Pious Queen New Anthems raise  Sing her own Fortunes and Her Maker's Praise  Invite the Nation willing Thanks to pay  And well may all the Mighty Ones Obey  So may they sing be always so preserv'd  By Grace unwish'd and Conquest undeserv'd  Now let us Welcome Home the Conquering Fleet  And all their well aton'd Mistakes forget  Such high Success shou'd all Resentments drown'd  Nothing but Joy and Welcome should be found  No more their past Miscariages Reprove  But bury all in Gratitude and Love  Let their high Conduct have a just Regard  And meaner Merit meet a kind Reward  But now what Fruits of Victory remain  To Heaven what Praise What Gratitude to Man  Let  France  sing Praise for Shams of Victories  And Mock their Maker with Religious Lies  But  England  blest with thankful Hearts shall raise  For mighty Conquests mighty Songs of Praise  She needs no false Pretences to Deceive  What all Men see all Men must needs believe  Our Joy can hardly run into Excess  The well known Subject all our Foes confess  We can't desire more they can't pretend to less  ANNE  like her Great Progenitor sings Praise  Like her she Conquers and like her she Prays  Like her she Graces and Protects the Throne  And counts the Lands Prosperity her own  Like her  and long like her  be Bless'd her Reign  Crown'd with new Conquests and more Fleets from  Spain    See now the Royal Chariot comes amain  With all the willing Nation in her Train  With humble Glory and with solemn Grace  Queen in her Eyes and Christian in her Face  With Her  Her represented Subjects join  And when She Prays th' whole Nation says  Amen    With Her in Stalls the Illustrious Nobles sat  The Cherubims and Seraphims of State  ANNE  like a Cornet in the Center shone  And they like Stars that circumfere the Sun  She Great in them and they as Great in Her  Sure Heaven will such Illustrious Praises hear  The crouding Millions Hearty Blessings pour  Saint  Paul  ne'er saw but one such Day before  FINIS
