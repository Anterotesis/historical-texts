 OROONOKO A TRAGEDY  OROONOKO OR THE ROYAL SLAVE A TRAGEDY  ALTERED FROM SOUTHERNE BY FRANCIS GENTLEMAN  As it was Performed at the THEATRE in EDINBURGH with universal Applause  GLASGOW PRINTED BY ROBERT AND ANDREW FOULIS MDCCLX  TO JAMES BOSWELL ESQ  HOW can the muse with burthen'd pinions soar  No flow'rs appear among the winter's store  Remov'd from FORTUNE'S vivifying heat  Almost within the Frigid Zone of fate  Can shiv'ring fancy fondly hope to rise  Through the rough regions of tempestuous skies  'Tis madness to attemptyet REASON proud  With Godlike energy thus cries aloud  ' Let fools the deity of FORTUNE own  ' I view alike a cottage or a throne  ' Intrinsic worth alone has charms for me  ' The worth of virtue and of liberty  ' Rouze then nor let an apathy of soul  ' Thy active freeborn faculties controul  ' Behold aright the attributes of state  ' They are not always happy who are great  ' Invoke CONTENT to soothe thy troubled mind  ' CONTENT the opulence of human kind  ' That like the tuneful herald of the morn  ' When rosytinctur'd beams the East adorn  ' From his grass pallat mounts on cow'ring wings  ' And from his height serenelooks down on kings  ' Then pleas'd returns into his humble bed  ' And rests while sleep from grandeur's couch is fled  ' Such is CONTENTher sacred aid invoke  Sweet as Orphean lyre the voice that spoke  As that could lull the savage herds to rest  So this can calm the troubles of my breast  'Tis donecare's  urrow'd brow is render'd even  The call of REASON is the call of Heav'n  And now to justly dedicate those lays  Which through the parentstock must hope for praise  From SOUTHERNE'S muse existence must derive  Must live through him if they should chance to live  Shall I for some exalted title seek  And cringe to fortune not to merit speak  Noshe disdains a task so meanly low  In ev'ry shape to flattery a foe  But where with honest pleasure she can find  Sense taste politeness with goodnature join'd  There gladly will she raise her humble voice  Nor fears to tell that BOSWELL is her choice  FRANCIS GENTLEMAN  GLASGOW  February  PROLOGUE  HOW difficult the task of those who aim  By lays dramatic to arrive at same  Who fondly hope 'twill prove a work of ease  The appetites of all their guests to please  This vain attempt eludes the nicest care  For taste's as different as our faces are  SOUTHERNE whose tender muse could well impart  The noblest feelings to each melting heart  And raise by force divine for the distress'd  Grief's tend'rest sympathy in ev'ry breast  Who wanted but attention to command  The subject passions with a master hand  Was forc'd when he adventur'd on the stage  To prostitute his genius to the Age  An Age remarkable for wit and vice  When pleasure must be had at any price  When wounded virtue hung her languid head  And ev'ry sense of public shame was fled  When hapless poets if they wish'd to eat  Must furnishtho' regreta luscious treat  This sad necessity even DRYDEN'S muse  With such immoral pieces could abuse  In their deformity his beauties fade  And all his laurels wither in their shade  But now when chaster judgment holds the scales  And taste with delicacy join'd prevails  From ribaldry to rescue virtuous lays  Must plead some favour though it reach not praise  Ye CALEDONIAN fair in whom we find  Each charm of person and each grace of mind  For Virtue's sake a feeble genius spare  The cause of Virtue's your peculiar care  In you it lies to censure or to save  To your protection take the ROYAL SLAVE  ADVERTISEMENT  THOUGH the Prologue shews the motive of this alteration it may not be improper to mention that it was first hinted to the Author by a Noble Personage who has eminently distinguished himself in the literary world and who recollected to have heard Mr SOUTHERNE declare in his latter days that he most heartily regretted his complying with licentious taste by writing any thing so offensive to modesty as the comic part of his works especially that which was so unnaturally joined to the tragedy of this play  The Author thinks himself obliged in gratitude to acknowledge the very candid reception  his  part of it met with from the polite and judicious audience of EDINBURGH without one person to recommend it as he chose to lie concealed and this approbation is the more extraordinary as the piece laboured under some lamentable deficiencies in the representation  Such lines as have been added to gratify curiosity are marked thus  '  Dramatis Personae  OROONOKO  ABOAN  GOVERNOR  BLANDFORD  MASSINGANO  ZINZO  CAPT DRIVER  PLANTERS and SLAVES  IMOINDA  OROONOKO  ACT THE FIRST  GOVERNOR and BLANDFORD  GOVERNOR  ' BLANDFORD your partial fortune ever smiles  ' Like a kind mistress lavish of her grace  ' She beams indulgent upon every wish  ' Yet this time tho' a prince becomes your slave  ' I envy not but in the former sale  ' Chance cross'd the strongest purpose of my heart  ' Your lovely prize the fair Clemene's charms  ' Assail'd and won my soul  Blan  ' You love her then  Gov  ' Too sure I love her more than words can speak  ' Each day the passion more enflames my breast  ' And tho' she wears the sable veil of grief  ' Tho' floods of tears o'erwhelm her starry eyes  ' Such native beauteous innocence appears  ' That thought can find no other theme but her  Blan  ' Have you reveal'd your passion told your love  ' Unless some sorrow of unknown import  ' Some mighty woe lies heavy on her heart  ' Her abject state may win her to your will  ' And then by shewing how you wish to please  ' Creating gratitude you'll gain her love  Gov  ' My tongue unpractised in the soothing art  ' But ill befits the tenderness of love  ' My stubborn temper with reluctance bends  ' To such soft feelings and I strive in vain  ' To deck persuasion in attractive phrase  ' Besides I fear some settled care within  ' But be it as it may she shall be mine  ' I will luxuriously possess her charms  ' And cure this raging fever of my soul  Blan  You've my consent to try all gentle means  Humanity obliges me to stand  Her guardian against violence  ' But see here comes the sordid Buccaneer  ' With a malicious joy upon his brow  ' To boast the merit of his savage trade  ' A wretch as ruthless as the prowling wolf  ' Without one human feeling in his breast  ' Yet vaunts that as a Christian he has right  ' To make the most of infidelshe's here  CAPTAIN DRIVER and PLANTERS  Driv  ' Well LieutenantGovernor I believe I have done my part this trip I have brought my full number of slaves and some such as don't come every day I was hard drove to bring the matter to bear but Dick Driver don't go without his errand so here they are I  ' have delivered them and now my lads it is your business to make the most of them in your way as I have done in mine  Gov  ' Your active spirit has serv'd the colony Captain and deserves our thanks  Driv  ' Nay do you see for that matter Governor I want no complementeering I serve the colony and myself I am not one of your what d'ye callum's that love their country better than themselves no no I plow the deep my masters and give chase to Fortune with all the sail I can make when I clap her aboard she'll soon strike  Blan  ' There you are right Captain Fortune womanlike must be close pursu'd and seldom can resist the brave  Driv  ' True spring my bowsprit and so I often told Jack Handspike he and I were fellowprentices and messmates as honest a fellow Jack was as ever knock'd off a can of slip but he had a damn'd troublesome companion call'd Conscience I bid him shake hands and part but I don't know how he wou'd row against wind and tide and now he plies before the mast while I command the Charming Peggyas good a seaboat as ever swam but no matter for that he has his conscience he he he  Gov  But Captain where are the slavesthey are long acoming  Blan  And who is this prince that's fall'n to my lot for our lord Governor  Driv  He's the devil of a fellow that I can tell you a prince every inch of him you have paid dear enough for him for all the good he'll do you I was forc'd to clap him in irons and did not think the ship safe neither You are in hostility with the Indians they say they threaten you daily you had best have an eye upon him  Blan  But who is he  Driv  Why he is son and heir to the great King of Angola a mischievous monarch in those parts who by his good will would never let any of his neighbours be quiet This son was his General a plaguy sighting fellow I have formerly had dealings with him for slaves which he took prisoners and have got pretty roundly by him But the war being at an end and nothing more to be got by the trade of the countryI made bold to bring the prince along with me  Gov  How could you do that  Blan  What steal a prince out of his own country Impossible  Driv  'Twas hard indeedHowever I did itYou must know this Oroonoko  Blan  Is that his name  Driv  Ay Oroonoko  Gov  Oroonoko  Driv  He's naturally inquisitive about the men and manners of the white nations so because I cou'd give him some accounts of those parts of the world I grew very much into his favour  'When I made my last voyage he had quarrell'd with his father about some  woman and grew so damn'd surly that he wou'd scarce speak to any body so they desir'd I wou'd get him on board my ship and try to make him merry'  on this I invited him I could do no less you know as he had been a friend to me I prepar'd my entertainment so he came in the evening and brought about twenty friends with him the punch flew about and as many of his companions as I thought would be dangerous I sent dead drunk on shorethe rest we secur'd and so you have the Prince Oroonoko  Plant  Gad amercy Captain there you was with him i'faithSuch men as you are fit to be employ'd in public affairs the plantation will thrive by you  Plant  Ay ay industry ought to be encourag'd  Driv  There's nothing to be done without it boys I have made my fortune this way  Gov  But Captain methinks you have taken a great deal of pains about this Prince Oroonoko why did you part with him at the rate of common slaves  Driv  Why LieutenantGovernor I'll tell you I did intend to have carried him to England and to have shewn him there but I found him troublesome upon my hands and I am glad to be rid of him at any rateI think I hear them coming  Blan  Many of these here doom'd to drag a life of slavery know nothing better they were born slaves and only change their masters but a prince taught only to command betray'd and sold my heart drops blood for him  Driv  Now Governor here he comes pray observe him  'I did not strip him and his favourite of their finery because it sets 'em off to the best advantage  Slaves pass over two and two  Enter OROONOKO and ABOAN  Oro  So Sir you have kept your word with me  Driv  I am better Christian I thank you than to keep my word with a heathen  Oro  You are a Christian be a Christian still  If you have any God that teaches you  To break your word I need not curse you more  Let him cheat you as you are false to me  Ye faithful followers of my better fortune  We have been fellowsoldiers in the field  Now we are fellowslaves This last farewel  Be sure of one thing that will comfort us  Whatever world we next are thrown upon  Cannot be worse than this    Exeunt Slaves  Driv  You see Governor what a bloody Pagan he is but I took care none of his followers should be in the same lot with him for fear they shou'd undertake some desperate action to the danger of the colony  Oro  Live still in fear it is the villain's curse  And will revenge my chains fear even me  Who have no power to hurt thee Nature abhors  And drives thee out from the society  And commerce of mankind for breach of faith  Men live and prosper but in mutual trust  A confidence of one another's truth  That thou hast violated I have done  I know my fortune and submit to it  Gov  Sir I am sorry for your fortune and would help it if I could  Blan  Take off his chainsYou know your condition but you are fallen into honourable hands you are the Lord Governor's slave who will use you nobly in his absence it shall be my care to serve you  Oro  I hear you but I can believe no more  ' 'Tis not the Christian lure of fairfaced smiles  ' Where lurks deceit in friendship's borrow'd guise  ' Can now ensnare my deep experienc'd heart  ' That shame of nature and the human form  ' Who barter'd honesty and me for gold  ' Profess'd as fair and much as you can do  ' Whilst I determin'd to be just myself  ' Thought others so and thus became a slave  Gov  Captain I am afraid the world wont speak so honourably of this action of yours as you would wish  Driv  Look ye LieutenantGovernor I don't wish about the matterI have the moneylet the world talk and be damn'dI care not  Oro  I would forget myselfBe satisfy'd    To Blandford after talking with him aside  I am above the rank of common slaves  Let that content youThe Christian there who knows me  For his own sake will not discover more  Driv  I have other matters to mind You have him so much good may do you with your Prince Oroonoko  Exit Driver    To the Planters who stare at Oroonoko  Blan  What wou'd you have there You stare as if you never saw a man beforeStand farther off  Oro  Let them stare on  I am unfortunate but not asham'd  Of being so No let the guilty blush  The white man who betray'd me honest black  Disdains to change its colourI am ready  Where must I go Dispose me as you please  I am not well acquainted with my fortune  But must learn to know it betterso I know you say  Degrees make all things easy  Blan  All things shall be easy  Oro  Tear off this pomp and let me know myself  The slavish habit best becomes me now  Hard fare and chains and whips may overpow'r  The frailer flesh and bow my body down  But there's another nobler part of me  Out of your reach which you can never tame  Blan  You shall find nothing of this misery  You apprehend We are not monsters all  ' Some here the touch of melting pity know  ' Our eyes have tears for merit in distress  ' Our hearts are form'd to sympathize in woe  ' And tho' your wrongs may fix a gen'ral charge  ' An undistinguish'd infamy on all  ' 'Tis Christian virtue to delight in good  ' Tho' Christian av'rice breaks each social tie  Oro  ' What is your government your boasted laws  ' Compiled to form and civilize your states  ' If breach of faith is let unpunish'd pass  ' The needy wretch who steals a piece of oar  ' Repays the injury with loss of life  ' While the successful subjects of deceit  ' Who wound our natures in each vital part  ' Receive applause and triumph in their guilt  ' Yet still with selfish arrogance on climes  ' Where simple honesty and nature reigns  ' You cast the name of savage with contempt  ' But know proud boasters those unletter'd shores  ' Claim brighter virtues far than art e'er taught  ' Learning and fraud are equally unknown  Blan  We hear with pleasure Sir and must admire  ' Those sentiments which speak a noble mind  ' But hope your future treatment may remove  ' This too just prejudice and gain esteem  You seem unwilling to disclose yourself  Therefore thro' fear the mentioning your name  Shou'd give you new disquiet I presume  To call you Caesar  Oro  I am myselfbut call me what you please  Gov  A very good name and fit for your character  Oro  Was Caesar then a slave  Gov  I think he was to pirates toohe was a great conqueror but unfortunate in his friends  Oro  His friends were Christians then  Blan  No  Oro  No that's strange  Gov  And murder'd by them  Oro  I would be Caesar there Yet I will live  Blan  Live to be happier  Oro  ' No let me manifest a greater soul  ' Than to confide in that deluder Hope  ' At whose false shrine the wretched seek relief  ' The weakest mind with happiness in view  ' Tho' distant far can bear the pangs of woe  But when upon the weary wing of thought  We range the waste of desolate despair  Nor start a gleam of hope 'then the tryal comes  ' And nature pleading for existence here  ' Applauds the wretched who can dare to live  Blan  ' Your mind's disturb'd I will intrude no more  ' But wait upon attend and serve you  Oro  ' Do with me what you will'Tis equal all  ' I am a slaveyet still a greater curse  ' Renders the torments of that station worse  ' But wherefore touch upon my private grief  ' Tho' you shou'd feel you cannot bring relief    Exeunt  MASSINGANO solus  ' Thou nurse of discontent lov'd solitude  ' To thy deserted shrine my wishes bend  ' In thy lone walks on meditation's wing  ' I soar above captivity and chains  ' Again I visit Africk's golden shores  ' And fancied freedom balms my wounded mind  ' In the lov'd semblance of rejoicing friends  ' With all the awful charms of martial fame  ' And milder beauties of domestic bliss  ' But oh how short this visionary joy  ' Transient and like the lightning's subtle beam  ' When flashing thro' the sable gloom of night  ' So swift the airbuilt column of my joy  ' Dissolves and leaves me in the gulph of woe  ' Sure I must dreammy eyes must play me false  ' Or in my view a well known figure comes  '

YOU know my story and you say you are  A friend to my misfortunes that's a name  Will teach you what you owe yourself and me  Blan  I'll study to deserve to be your friend  When once our noble Governor arrives  With him you will not need my interest  He is too generous not to feel your wrongs  But be assur'd I will employ my pow'r  And find the means to send you home again  Oro  I thank you Sirmy honest wretched friends    Sighing  Their chains are heavy they have hardly found  So kind a master May I ask you Sir  What is become of them Perhaps I should not  You will forgive a stranger  Blan  I'll enquire  And use my best endeavours where they are  To have 'em gently us'd  Oro  Once more I thank you  You offer ev'ry cordial that can keep  My hopes alive to wait a better day  What friendly care can do you have apply'd  But oh I have a grief admits no cure  Blan  You do not know Sir  Oro  Can you raise the dead  Pursue and overtake the wings of time  And bring about again the hours the days  The years that made me happy  Blan  That is not to be done  Oro  No there is nothing to be done for me    Kneeling and kissing the earth  Thou God ador'd thou ever glorious sun  If she be yet on earth send me a beam  Of thy allseeing pow'r to light me to her  Or if thy sister goddess has preferr'd  Her beauty to the skies to be a star  O tell me where she shines that I may stand  Whole nights and gaze upon her  Blan  I am rude and interrupt you  Oro  I am troublesome  But pray give me your pardon My swoll'n heart  Bursts out its passage and I must complain  O can you think of nothing dearer to me  Dearer than liberty my country friends  Much dearer than my life that I have lost  The tend'rest best belov'd and loving wife  Blan  Alas I pity you  Oro  Do pity me  Pity's akin to love and every thought  Of that soft kind is welcome to my soul  I would be pity'd here  Blan  I dare not ask  More than you please to tell me but if you  Think it convenient to let me know  Your story I dare promise you to bear  A part in your distress if not assist you  Oro  Thou honesthearted man I wanted such  Just such a friend as thou art that would sit  Still as the night and let me talk whole days  Of my Imoinda O I'll tell thee all  From first to last and pray observe me well  Blan  I will most heedfully  Oro  There was a stranger in my father's court  Valu'd and honour'd much he was a white  The first I ever saw of your complexion  He chang'd his God for ours and so grew great  Of many virtues and so fam'd in arms  He still commanded all my father's wars  I was bred under him One fatal day  The armies joining he before me stept  Receiving in his breast a poison'd dart  Levell'd at me he dy'd within my arms  I've tir'd you already  Blan  Pray go on  Oro  He left an only daughter whom he brought  An infant to Angola When I came  Back to the court a happy conqueror  Humanity oblig'd me to condole  With this sad virgin for a father's loss  Lost for my safety I presented her  With all the slaves of battle to atone  Her father's ghost But when I saw her face  And heard her speak I offer'd up myself  To be the sacrifice She bow'd and blush'd  I wonder'd and ador'd The sacred pow'r  That had subdu'd me then inspir'd my tongue  Inclin'd her heart and all our talk was love  Blan  Then you were happy  Oro  O I was too happy  I marry'd her and though my country's custom  Indulg'd the privilege of many wives  I swore myself never to know but her  She grew with child and I grew happier still  O my Imoinda But it could not last  Her fatal beauty reach'd my father's ears  He sent for her to court where cursed court  No woman comes but for his am'rous use  He raging to possess her she was forc'd  To own herself my wife The furious king  Started at incest but grown desperate  Not daring to enjoy what he desir'd  In mad revenge which I could never learn  He poison'd her or sent her far far off  Far from my hopes ever to see her more  Blan  Most barbarous of fathers the sad tale  Has struck me dumb with wonder  Oro  I have done  I'll trouble you no farther now and then  A sigh will have its way that shall be all  FIRST PLANTER  Plant  Blandford the LieutenantGovernor is gone to your plantation He desires you wou'd bring the royal slave with you The sight of his fair mistress he says is an entertainment for a prince he would have his opinion of her  Oro  Is he a lover  Blan  So he says himself he flatters a beautiful slave that I have and calls her mistress  Oro  Must he then flatter her to call her mistress  I pity the proud man who thinks himself  Above being in love what tho' she be a slave  She may deserve him  Blan  You shall judge of that when you see her Sir  Oro  I go with you    Exeunt  IMOINDA sola  ' Tis all in vainI cannot sooth my woe  ' Nor place nor prospect can afford relief  ' Tho' jocund nature smiles in ev'ry part  ' All studied arts to heal th' unquiet mind  ' But more perplex and minister fresh pain  ' Tho' pity's hand has kindly loos'd my chains  ' Smooth'd stern captivity to gentle smiles  ' And try'd all means to flatter female pride  ' My widow'd heart that mourns its absent mate  ' Shuns the fond service of officious care  ' When martyr'd love lies bleeding in the breast  ' Each faculty must feel the pangs of grief  ' Ev'n churlish reason yields its tyrant sway  ' And melts in streams of pity from the eyes  ' Such hopeless woe is mineyet nature still  ' Inflexibly denies my only wish  ' To find a peaceful refuge in the grave  Enter GOVERNOR  Gov  I have disturb'd you I confess my fault  My fair Clemenebut begin again  And I will listen to your mournful plaint  Sweet as the soft complaining nightingale's  While every word calls out my raptur'd soul  And leaves me silent as the midnight groves  Speak speak again and let me wonder at  The matchless power you have to charm me  Imo  ' If sighs and tears can find the way to please  ' This heart these eyes may prove the source of joy  ' But wherefore seek you from a wretch like me  ' What only can be found in minds at ease  ' If ought but sorrow you expect to meet  ' Your cheated senses have mistook their way  ' Within this breast in melancholy state  ' Despair and sadness hold their gloomy reign  ' And exil'd pleasure flies the dreary waste  Gov  You must not weep I come to dry your tears  And raise you from your sorrow Look upon me  Look with the eyes of kind indulging love  That I may have full cause for what I say  I come to offer you your liberty  And be myself your slave'My fortune pow'r  ' All shall be made subservient to your will  ' What nature can produce or art devise  ' To rouze you from this lethargy of woe  ' Now waits on your acceptance  Imo  ' 'Tis vain to ask  ' What I have not alas the pow'r to give  ' Yet gratitude requires to pay my thanks  ' For proffer'd kindness and experienc'd care  ' But ev'ry state is now alike to me  ' The senses wrapp'd in moping melancholy  ' Remain unmov'd at pleasure's sprightly call  ' Desist then timely from such fruitless pains  ' And if the friendless may demand a boon  ' To some lone place as gloomy as my thoughts  ' Where barren nature wears eternal frowns  ' And wintry tempests howldirect my steps  ' There more at ease than in the shine of life  ' Let griefworn thought in silence reach the grave  Gov  ' Yet hear the voice of pity and of love  ' No more my fair admit the tyrant grief  ' To prey upon the roses of thy cheeks  ' Like eastern blasts upon the flow'rs of spring  ' Dry up the fountain of thy ceaseless tears  ' And let those eyes in native lustre shine  ' Give me thy hand and with enliv'ning touch  ' Convey soft rapture to my wishing soul  ' You turn away and are unkindly coy  ' But I have urg'd too far to be denied  ' And to relieve your modesty from pain  ' Must gently force you to comply  Imo  ' Oh Sir  ' Let me conjure you by each social tie  ' By whatsoever Deity you serve  ' And all you hold most dear in earth or heav'n  ' Wound not my nature in its tenderest part  ' Behold me thrown thus prostrate at your feet  ' And if my tears have any pow'r to move  ' Oh let them plead the rescue of my fame  ' Or if you cannot purchase peace on cheaper terms  ' Here kill me and remove the cause of pain  Gov  ' Nay 'tis ungrateful to avoid my love  ' But have a care lest passion turn'd to hate  ' Should change the kind indulgence you have met  ' To treatment better fitted to a slave  Imo  ' Oh let it come I cannot fear it now  ' Those feeble limbs in slavish garments wrapp'd  ' Shall gladly toil beneath the scorching sun  ' Or freeze beneath the winter's piercing sky  ' Then when the labour of the day is pass'd  ' And weary nature sickens for repose  ' Contented rest upon th' uncover'd ground  ' Still free in mind in spotless virtue rich  Gov  ' 'Tis idle all the virtue which you preach  ' That foe to ev'ry true enjoyment here  ' Is but a phantom of unfeeling minds  ' Once more I take your handyour modesty  ' Wou'd draw it backbut you wou'd take it ill  ' If I should let it goI know you would  ' I see you must be forc'd to please yourself  ' Nay if you struggle with me I must take  Imo  You may my life that I can part with freely  But with my virtue never    Exit  Gov  She's gone  ' Curse on the pride that swells her foolish heart  ' And stands the bar between me and enjoyment  Enter BLANDFORD and OROONOKO  Blan  Governor we don't disturb I hope  How has Clemene listen'd to your suit  She's thankful for the honour I suppose  Gov  Deaf as the winds to ev'ry thing I say  Still when I speak to her she sighs and weeps  Something more near than bondage she laments  Blan  What do her fellow slaves say of her they perhaps  May find the cause  Gov  'Tis secret still from all  Some who

love  A brave resentment which inspir'd by you  Might kindle and diffuse a gen'rous rage  Among the slaves to rouze and shake our chains  And struggle to be free  Oro  How can we help ourselves  Abo  I knew you when you wou'd have found a way  How help ourselves the very Indians teach us  We need but to attempt our liberty  And we carry it We have hands sufficient  Double the number of our

the first moment they put on my chains  I have thought of nothing but the weight of 'em  And how to throw 'em off can yours sit easy  Oro  I have a sense of my condition  As painful and as quick as yours can be  I feel for my Imoinda and myself  Imoinda much the tenderest part of me  But tho' I languish for my liberty  I would not buy it at the Christian price  Of black ingratitude they sha'not say  That we deserv'd our fortune by our crimes  Murder the innocent  Abo  The innocent  Oro  These men are so whom you would rise against  If we are slaves they did not make us slaves  But bought us in an honest way of trade  As we have done before 'em bought and sold  Many a wretch and never thought it wrong  They paid our price for us and we are now  Their property a part of their estate  To manage as they please Mistake me not  I do not tamely say that we should bear  All that they could lay upon us but we find  The load so light so little to be felt  Considering they have us in their pow'r  And may inflict what grievances they please  We ought not to complain  Abo  My royal Lord  You do not know the heavy grievances  The toils the labours weary drudgeries  Which they impose burdens more sit for beasts  For senseless beasts to bear than thinking men  Then if you saw the bloody cruelties  They execute on every slight offence  Nay sometimes in their proud insulting sport  How worse than dogs they lash their fellowcreatures  Your heart wou'd bleed for 'em Oh could you know  How many wretches lift their hands and eyes  To you for their relief  Oro  I pity 'em  And wish I could with honesty do more  Abo  You must do more and may with honesty  O royal Sir remember who you are  A Prince born for the good of other men  Whose Godlike office is to draw the sword  Against oppression and set free mankind  And this I'm sure you think oppression now  What tho' you have not felt their miseries  Never believe you are oblig'd to them  They have their selfish reasons may be now  For using of you well but there will come  A time when you must have your share of 'em  Oro  You see how little cause I have to think so  Favour'd in my own person in my friends  Indulg'd in all that can concern my care  In my Imoinda's soft society    Embracing her  Abo  And therefore you wou'd lie contented down  In the forgetfulness and arms of love  To get young Princes for 'em  Oro  Say'st thou ha  Abo  Princes the heirs of empire and the last  Of your illustrious lineage to be born  To pamper up their pride and be their slaves  Oro  Imoinda save me save me from that thought  Imo  There is no safety from it I have long  Suffer'd it with a mother's labouring pains  And can no longer Kill me kill me now  While I am blest and happy in your love  Rather than let me live to see you hate me  As you must hate me me the only cause  The fountain of these flowing miseries  Oro  Shall the dear babe the eldest of my hopes  Whom I begot a Prince be born a slave  The treasure of this temple was design'd  T' enrich a kingdom's fortune Shall it here  Be seiz'd upon by vile unhallow'd hands  To be employ'd in uses most profane  Abo  In most unworthy uses think of that  And while you may prevent it O my Lord  Rely on nothing that they promise you  They speak you fair I know and bid you wait  But think what 'tis to wait on promises  And promises of men who know no tie  Upon their words against their interest  And where's their interest in freeing you  Imo  O where indeed to lose so many slaves  Abo  Nay grant this man you think so much your friend  Be honest and intends all that he says  He is but one and in a government  Where he confesses you have enemies  That watch your looks What looks can you put on  To please those men who are before resolv'd  To read 'em their own way Alas my Lord  If they incline to think you dangerous  They have their knavish arts to make you so  And then who knows how far their cruelty  May carry their revenge  Imo  To every thing  That does belong to you your friends and me  I shall be torn from you forced away  Helpless and miserable shall I live  To see that day again  Oro  That day shall never come  Abo  I know you are persuaded to believe  The Governor's arrival will prevent  These mischiefs and bestow your liberty  But who is sure of that I rather fear  More mischiefs from his coming he is young  Luxurious passionate and amorous  Such a complexion when made bold by pow'r  To count'nance all that he is prone to do  Will know no bounds no law against his lusts  If in a fit of his intemperance  With a strong hand he shall resolve to seize  And force my royal Mistress from your arms  How can you help yourself  Oro  Ha thou hast rous'd  The lion in his den he stalks abroad  And the wide forest trembles at his roar  I find the danger now my spirits start  At the alarm and from all quarters come  To man my heart the citadel of love  Is there a pow'r on earth to force you from me  And shall I not resist it nor strike first  To keep to save you to prevent that curse  This is your cause and shall it not prevail  Oh you were born always to conquer me  Now I am fashion'd to thy purpose speak  What combination what conspiracy  Would'st thou engage me in I'll undertake  All thou would'st have me now for liberty  For the great cause of love and liberty  Abo  Now my great master you appear yourself  And since we have you join'd in our design  It cannot fail us I have muster'd up  The choicest slaves men who are sensible  Of their condition and seem most resolv'd  ' Men whom a train of injuries have roused  ' To any act that may restore their freedom  ' Or give a fair occasion of revenge  ' We have unbosom'd mutually our griefs  ' And sworn if you approve a solemn league  Oro  ' When liberty points out the glorious way  ' Thy Prince's heart can never lag behind  ' Let freedom martial her intrepid sons  ' And to the verge or through the gulph of fate  ' I will conduct their animated course  ' Yet do not wish to shed ev'n Christian blood  Abo  ' Nor I if other means can serve our ends  ' If not 'tis done in selfdefence and then  ' Severest justice sanctifies the deed  ' Even fortune hitherto so much our foe  ' Seems to relentthat ship in whose dark womb  ' The cave of slavery we hither came  ' Lies in our reach within the river's mouth  ' And some of those who join in our design  ' Used by their Christian tyrants in the trade  ' Know how to steer her through the wat'ry world  Oro  ' How shall I thank thee for thy honest pains  ' Which have devised and laid so bold a plan  ' Summon thy friends and soon as rising morn  ' Shall gild the summit of yon eastern hills  ' Let them assemble westward of the grove  ' That skirts along the river side there I will appear  ' And join to put the wish'd event to proof  ' If we succeed I shall possess the means  ' To give my valiant friends a just reward  ' To place my loved Imoinda on a throne  ' And gild our greatness with domestic bliss  ' But if an adverse fate should still attend  ' Death laurelcrown'd will come a welcome friend  ' And kindly waft us to that honest shore  ' Where Christian frauds shall never reach us more  ' At least
