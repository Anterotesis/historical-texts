 A  Bickerstaff  's Burying OR Work for the  Upholders  A FARCE As it is ACTED at the  THEATRES  with Applause By His MAJESTY'S Servants  Written by Mrs  Susanna Centlivre  Author of  The Gamester  a Comedy  DUBLIN  Printed by  S Powell  for  George Risk  at the Corner of  Castlelane  in  Damestreet  near the  Horse guard  MDCCXXIV  Dramatis Personae  MEN  Mezro  Captain  Boatswain    st Sailor    d Sailor  WOMEN  Lady  Mezro  Isabinda  her Niece  A  Lady  Officer  Servants  Lucy  To the Magnificent COMPANY of UPHOLDERS  c  CÆ²stom has made some Things absolutely necessary and two Sheets without a Dedication or a Preface by way of Excuse would be an unpardonable Indecency To avoid which I was considering at whose Feet to lay these following Scenes First I thought of offering it to all those young Wives who had sold themselves for Money and been inter'd with Misery from the first Day of their Marriage but supposing their chief Pleasure to consist in Pride and that they had rather gratify their Ambition in the Arms of a Fool or Fourscore than wed a Man of Sense of narrower Fortunes I concluded 'em unworthy of my Notice  Then the Race of Old Men presented themselves in my Mind who despising Women of their own Years marry Girls of fifteen by which they keep open House for all the young Fellows in Town in order to encre  se their Families and make their Tables flourish like the Vine But my Aversion to Fools of all Kinds made me decline them too  At last casting my Eyes upon the Title of the F  rce I found it could justly belong to none but the Magnificent Company of  Upholders  whom the judicious Censor of  Great Britain  has so often condescended to mention to you then worthy Sirs whose solemn Train keeps up the pompous State of Beauty beyond the Limits of a Gasp of Breath and draws the gazing World to admire even after Death to you this Piece I Dedicate 'tis but Reason that you should receive some Tribute from us Living who so truly mourn us dead What does not Mankind owe to  you All Ranks and Conditions are obliged to you th  Aged and the Young the Generous and the Miser th  well descended and the boser born The Escutcheons gar+nish out the Hearse the Streamers and Wax Lights let  into the Name of a Man which all his Life had been hi  in Obscurity and many a Right Honourable would fal unlamented we  e it not for your decent Cloaks and dis+mal Faces that look as sorrowful as the Creditors the leave unpaid What an immense Sum might be rais'd from your Art to carry on the War would you like true  Briton  exert your Power The People being fond of Sights wh  might not be g  ther'd at a Funeral when the Rooms a  clad in Sable the Body dressd out with all your skilfu  Care the Tapers burning in their Silver Socke  s th  weeping Virgins fixt like Statues round and aromat  Gums persume the Chambers I think it preferable to th  Puppet Show and a Peny a Head for all the Curiou  would I dare be positive amount to more than the Candl  Tax and so make Death subservient to the Living  But this Gentlemen I leave to your superior Judgme  in Politick Principles and only beg leave to remind yo  that in this crouded Town there are a Prodigious Numb  of Mr  Bickerstaff  's Dead Men that swarm about Streets therefore for the Sakes of the most ingenious Part of Ma  kind you ought to take Care to interr them out of  Way since he that does no Good in his Generation shoul  not be reckon'd among the Living  And now to conclude Gentlemen I hope you'll pard  this Liberty I have taken and accept this as a Token  the Respect I bear your noble Society I honour you tho' have no Desire of falling into your Hands but I thi  we Poets are in no Danger of that since our real Esta  +lies in the Brain and our personal consists in two or th  loose Scenes a few Couplets for the Tag of an Act and slight Sketch for a  ong and as I take it you are  overfond of PaperCredit where there is no Probabili  of recovering the Debt So wishing you better Custome  I expect no Return but am proud of subscribing  self  GENTLEMEN  Your most obedient humble Serv  A  Bickerstaff  's Burying OR Work for the  Upholders  SCENE I  A working Sea seen at a Distance with the
