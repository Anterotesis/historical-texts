 AMANA A Dramatic Poem  Libertas et natale solum  By a LADY  LONDON Printed by T HARRISON For W JOHNSTON in LudgateStreet MDCCLXIV  PREFACE  THE story of this piece is taken from the moral and ingenious writings lately published stiled THE ADVENTURER Numbers and But the Drama which was too much confined in the fable has been inlarged here by the addition of four persons namely NARDIC ABDALLAH FATIMA and HAMET For tho' NARDIC and ABDALLAH SANBAD in the original are mentioned in the story they are not introduced into the scene  Some other alterations have been made in the fable in order to accommodate the representation to a British audience the machinery of genie's has been laid aside and the catastrophé brought to pass without the declared interposition of superior agents the time and place too have been restrained to preserve two of the unities Shakespear alone could  call spirits from the vasty deep  he was himself a superior intelligence could create beings not to be found in nature or fable could rock ages to sleep to hasten his events and  annihilate both time and space  to bring the history of a man within the representation of a day  "Existence saw him spurn her bounded reign  "And panting time toiled after him in vain"  But modern wits are no more able to stride in Shakespear's buskin than modern beaus to shoot in Ulysses' bow  The moral professed in the original story is  To shew the folly of human wishes and schemes for correcting the moral government of the world  which sentiment is preserved here in a speech of Amana's  O Nouradin  Forgive this fatal rashnessHad I staid  A few short moments we had now been blest  But wresting from the hand of providence  The means of my escape we both are wretched  But I confess that the reflections which occurred to my mind most strongly on the perusal of this tale were a tender and humane resentment of the miseries of those nations which are subject to despotic power and an exulting sense of the peculiar blessings of liberty that we enjoy in these thrice happy kingdoms  The contemplation of this contrast both suggested and inspired the plan of the following writing in which I have endeavoured to contribute my grateful mite of praise to those laws and to that government under which our superior advantages are established defended and preserved and however the presumption of this attempt may be condemned I hope that the faults of the performance may be pardoned as the first essay of  A Woman  To the RIGHT HONOURABLE The Countess of  Northumberland  MADAM  I Beg leave to lay at your ladyship's feet a work which from the spirit of liberty it attempts to breathe may hope for the honour of your patronage Your ladyship's own character justifies this address and the names of PERCY and SEYMOUR demand it History is my voucher and fame my herald Liberty was their crest and Glory their motto  BUT such an heroic subject is beyond my strength and I shall content myself with praising and admiring the more social and amiable virtues of your ladyship your humanity benevolence and affability which latter quality is the characteristic of true nobility in opposition to that haughtiness which is frequently observable in those who have sprung from obscurityThose who are placed on an eminence may  descend  but those on a level would  rise  IF this little work the offspring of a female and unlettered pen shall be so happy to amuse your ladyship for half an hour it will afford the highest satisfaction to the author who humbly presumes to hope that your ladyship's candour will pardon whatever defects your judgment may find in this piece for the sake of those sentiments it is intended to convey  I have the honour to be With the profoundest respect and humblest duty MADAM Your most

Minister  HAMET  Aga of his Guards  NOURADIN  an  Egyptian  Merchant  CALED  his Slave  ABDALLAH  Father to  Amana  WOMEN  Amana  FATIMA  Sultaness  Attendants Guards  c  SCENE  in and near  Grand Cairo  AMANA  ACT I  SCENE  A Fountain  Enter  AMANA  with a Goblet in her Hand  Amana  _HAIL sacred fount blessed by our holy prophet  Whose precepts pure as thy translucent stream  Cleanse the foul man diffusing health and virtue  Frequent ablutions purge our outward stains  And moral laws preserve our inward pureness  But hark a caravan approaches near  Quick from all eyes let me conceal my own  veils  Enter  CALED  Caled  Damsel by heat and thirst impelled I come  To seek refreshment from this hallowed spring  Say wilt thou lend that goblet  Amana  Take it freely  reaching it to him  Caled  Heavens what an arm a shape a mien an air  Such are the  Houries  promised us above  And why not taste our happiness below  She must unveil  aside  Withdraw that curtain maid  To cure my passion or confirm my wonder  taking hold of her  Amana  Rude stranger hold  Caled  Nay then I'll do it for thee  they struggle and her veil falls off  Enter  NOURADIN  Nouradin  Insolent slave forego thy brutal hold  Or by the soul of my departed father  strikes him  This moment is thy last Say beauteous maid  Can you forgive this ruffian's barbarous outrage  Or shall his instant death make just attonement  Enter  ABDALLAH  and  Amana  runs to him  Amana  O let me hide me in my father's bosom  Abdallah  My loved Amana my last grasp of life  What monster viler than the wildest Arab  Could dare insult thy unoffending youth  Or force thee lave thy glowing cheeks with tears  Nouradin  The slave who dared offend the angelic maid  Waits to receive his doom from her decree  And justice satisfied too lovely fair  I hope that vassal's crime will rest on him  Absolving us from any purpose vile  Nor may the innocent attone the guilty  Amana  Injustice dwells not in a heart like mine  Nor can resentment there long hold a place  To you my lord my grateful thanks are due  Who rescued me from brutal violence  That wretch's rude assault I pardon also  Let him depart unharmed  Nouradin  Excellent maid  Thy mind and body sure are of a piece  Bright emanations of the deity  Abdallah  If you from insult have preserved Amana  O take a father's prayer whose feeling heart  For every wrong she suffers must drop blood  My age's darling sole remaining stay  Which holds my frame from sinking to the grave  O could I see that tender lilly propt  By fortune's fostering hand or better far  Supported by the bridegroom rose I then  With smiles would close my wearied eyes in death  Nouradin  O if the purest flame that ever warmed  A virgin heart for such is mine to love  Unknowing of its pleasures or its pains  'Till I beheld this loveliest of her sex  And gazed my soul away O if a passion  Which in a moment equals that of years  Can make me worthy to possess such charms  Accept that prop that firm support in me  Whose circling arms shall screen her from each blast  Cherish her blooming years and nurse her age  Abdallah  Since heaven deprived me of its richest bounty  My lost Amestris joy hath never once  Pervaded this dark mansion the busy guest  Now fills each space nor leaves me room for utterance  Generous young man thy worth thy wealth and power  To me are fully known with gratitude  I willingly accept the proffered honour  If my Amana's heart feel no reluctance  To aid her father's wish and make us blest  But should all Egypt's monarch from his Throne  Descending court her to the bridal bed  If her repugnant heart refused his love  I would remit a father's stern behest  Nor force my child to splendid misery  What says Amana  Amana  My father's tenderness has been so great  That I have scarcely felt the bonds of duty  As inclination prompted every act  Which might appear obedience and in this  The most important deed of all my life  My heart feels no reluctance to obey  Nouradin  Extatic sound thus prostrate at thy feet  Let my full heart pour forth its grateful rapture  And by a life of love and friendly care  Repay the happiness I now receive  Abdallah  Arise my son and may our holy prophet  With benign aspect smile upon your union  May long and prosperous days attend your lives  And every hour increase your mutual flame  Nouradin  This day the mourning for my father ends  From Mecca's shrine to which in pilgrimage  I went I now return some Angel sure  Hath led my footsteps near this sacred fount  And in reward for filial duty paid  Hath blessed me with an husband's happy rites  With her's and your consent tomorrow's sun  Shall see us joined in Hymen's constant bands  Meantime to Cairo instant we'll repair  Where choicest ornaments shall deck my fair  Their rays inferior by thy eyes be shewn  Which shine in native modesty alone  exeunt  Nouradin Amana  and  Abdallah  Manet  CALED  Caled  May swift destruction overtake you both  And if wronged Caled's means can lend it aid  They shall be well supplied Thou Nouradin  Hast robbed me of this maid I met her first  And had a prior claim Her childish coyness  Would soon have yielded to my freeest wishes  Hadst thou not intervened while she right woman  Preferred the fortune to the man Nor yet  Is this the worst offence did he not strike thee  And act the bravo's part throughout A blow  What tho' the chance of war hath quite reversed  My outward seemings still my pride remains  As high as when in Spain my native country  I was saluted by the stile of lord  And tho' the Turk hath sold my limbs to bondage  The inward man no shackles can controul  My abject state restrains a nobler daring  Therefore I'll seek amends by cautious means  And may revenge quick animate my purpose  'Tis said that love has wingsBut vengeance still  Outstrips its flightThe Cyprian queen is drawn  By dovesThe bird of Jupiter's an eagle  On eagles wings my vengeance now shall speed  And in my talons grasp'd these doves shall bleed  exit  SCENE  changes to a palace  Enter  OSMIN  Osmin  What art thou pomp an airy being sure  Delusive shade which fools alone admire  But wisemen ne'er enjoy Even substances  Grow vain and mock the eager grasp the mind  Sated not satisfied with blooming beauty  Lo dull disgust pursues the tired embrace  Variety's a cheatInstead of quickening  It only palls the taste and sinks our relish  To depravity The lowly cottager  Whose homely wife made coarse by labour rests  Within his arms feels more of bliss than I  Who can command a thousand various fair  To inspire new wishes and revive my ardor  But then it is submission and not love  Which prompts their yieldingThey chuse not Osmin  But obey the Sultan while in full gust  Of amorous dalliance I but feel myself  An happy brute yet still a wretched man  Enter  FATIMA  Osmin  Why Fatima with illtimed zeal and fondness  Dost thou obtrude upon my private leizure  Fatima  Blame not th'impatience of unchanging passion  Which follows where attraction leads the way  Tho' that which once to me you urged is dead  Mine like the fragrant mittle lives in frost  Thy chilling coldness may destroy its blossoms  But cannot kill the root  Osmin  These strong professions  Of neverceasing love sound like upbraidings  To my tired earI like them notnor thee  Fatima  Oh do not wound me with such harsh expression  But since my once loved image hath forborne  To mark its former traces in thy bosom  Yet still in pity to my sex's weakness  Restrain thy speech from scorn O spare the guilt  To thy own breast of stabbing mine with grief  Yet leave me hopethe wretch's only solace  And let the jealous doubts of slighted love  And not thy stern decree pronounce my doom  Oh suffer me to gaze sometimes in rapture  Upon my sovereign's face to hear that voice  Which whilom used to inspire my soul with joy  And ease my heart with sighing on thy bosom  Osmin  Awayaway dalliance without desire  Is lifeless sportbesides it might encrease  Thy hapless flame and I in generous pity  Would quickly cure thy simple sex's folly  RetireI am used to dictatenot to argue  Fatima  Since you pronounce it I will go for ever  A banished wretch exiled of joy or hope  But dread the anguish thou hast made me feel  May be repaid thee in the same degree  Love is a vengeful power and will I hope  Resent his votary's cause some beauteous maid  Shall yet avenge my wrongs and make thee know  Worse pangs than I do nowif possible  Osmin  Thy vain predictions like phantastic dreams  Vanish in empty air I dare deny  That all the charms of thy whole sex conjoined  Can raise or pain or pleasure in my breast  Full well I know therefore despise ye all  Fatima  Then hear almighty love thy suppliant's prayer  If thou dost ever touch that stubborn heart  With bitterest venom tinge the piercing dart  Mix yellow jealousy and fireeyed rage  And may no healing balm his pangs assuage  Let him feel all love's anguish all its pain  And may his fondest wishes meet disdain  exit  Enter  NARDIC  Nardic  May endless days of never fading bliss  Await my sovereign may still ripening honours  Bloom round his brow and each day add new trophies  To adorn his fame Behold from Gaza's walls  A messenger arrived proclaims your arms  Victorious o'er the rebel slaves who now  All own allegiance to thy rightful sway  Osmin  'Tis well  Now let those lofty disaffected towers  That braved the heavens and me be razed to earth  And let all those who dared oppose my reign  Now feel my vengeance Is the city sacked  Nardic  Yes mighty Sultan  Osmin  Then let its name no longer be remembered  But see O Nardic how the shortlived joy  Inspired by this success like the swift glare  Of lightning is extinguished Discontent  Returns and renders still thy prince unhappy  Nardic  Where then may we seek bliss if he whose nod  Gives life or death while numerous nations wait  Attendant on his will can yet be wretched  Whose every sense is gratified to fulness  While all of art and all of nature join  To soothe his wish and court his appetite  Our bounteous Nile yields all that can indulge  The smell or taste of fruits and flowers luxuriant  Our minstrels cunning in their harmony  Draw forth such dulcet sounds as might assist  Creation in her work and animate  The dust from whence we sprang But O the last  The best the highest pitch of mortal bliss  See the collected master works of nature  The lovely fair from various regions sought  Envying each other every partial smile  Osmin  Avaunt audacious slave darest thou presume  To expostulate with me When I have said  That I am most unhappy think'st thou then  Thy flattering tongue can gloss my wretchedness  But wherefore do I suffer thee to breathe  Thou abject thing except to administer  Delight to Osmin Then hear my firm resolve  If in three days thou find'st not some new joy  Some untried vanity that may awake  My soul and rouse it to a sense of pleasure  Thy head shall pay the forfeitVanish straight  Nor waste thy precious time in vain debating  exit  Nardic  Osmin  I have surrounded joy's capricious maze  Yet cannot find the clueSome demon sure  Withholds itBut I'll seek it in the pit  Of Acheron or missing sink in the pursuit  Nor rapes nor murders shall obstruct my course  Pleasures like maids must first be won by force  Of them too when we taste we soon are cloyed  And only sigh for those not yet enjoyed  End of the  First Act  ACT II  SCENE NARDIC  's Apartment  NARDIC  Solus  Nardic  TERROR solicitude and wild despair  Pursue my steps Each moment seems my last  The tyrant seeks my life and he must have it  Where can I turn to find new joys for one  Who has in vain exhausted nature's treasure  And plenteous as she is hath made her bankrupt  Were he indeed a king I might supply  New objects daily to relieve his languor  And yield him transports beyond mortal sense  To feed the poor to comfort the distressed  To usher bashful genius into life  Become a parent to the orphan's tear  "And cause the widow's heart to sing for joy"  Exalt a monarch to an angel's rank  But virtue ne'er hath warmed his earthborn soul  'Tis a sixth sense to Osmin Science fair  To him hath spread her lettered page in vain  His mind ne'er reached to contemplation's height  Nor felt the rapture of a moral sense  His pulse his nerves form all his notices  His heart his soul are aliens to his joys  I have sent proclamation forth that he  Who in two days produce the fairest virgin  To fill the Sultan's arms shall in degree  Stand next to Nardic be the third within  This spacious realm No claimant yet appears  Enter an  Attendant  and  CALED  Attendant  This stranger mighty lord earnest desires  To come into thy presence I have now  Fulfilled thy wish  to  Caled  Nardic  'Tis wellRetire  exit  Attend  What would'st thou  Caled  Let Nardic's smiles from out the dust raise up  The lowest slave that mingles with his fellows  Here may my faithful service be accepted  And Osmin's arms be blessed with sovereign beauty  Nardic  Say on for lo my ears are all attention  Caled  This day the merchant Nouradin prepares  To wed the fairest maid Circassia's plains  Or Georgia's vales have ever yet presented  To the seraglio's of the South or East  The fabled Venus fails of her description  And those angelic nymphs which by our prophet  Are promised to the happy saints above  But equal her perfection Never sure  For vulgar use were charms like her's ordained  Our Caliph only may deserve such bliss  Nardic  If that thy tongue unused to flattering speech  Hath but reported truly quick expect  The high reward proclaimedNay more endowed  With all the active friendship of my life  Haste then and bring this most transcendent fair  To bless my longing sight  Caled  My gracious lord  Without thy aid our purposed wish were vain  Lo Caled is the slave of Nouradin  And shall he dare to ravish from his arms  The bride of his affections Thou must lend  The Sultan's power which only can accomplish  His happiness and ours with that invested  Instant I'll force her to your raptured gaze  And prove that I want art to paint her charms  Nardic  The royal mandate quick shall be prepared  And if our holy prophet aids my prayer  She'll answer to thy boast Come in with me  exeunt  SCENE  A Garden  NOURADIN  and  AMANA  seated in a Bower  Nouradin  My beauteous bride with pleasure I survey  These dazzling gems diminished in their lustre  By thy bright eyes like stars before the sun  But O that glorious planet moves but slowly  Stopping perhaps his course to gaze on thee  Were Thetis such a bride as my Amana  His chariot would outspeed the wind and yet  Not equal my impatience for the night  Amana  All that I hear all that I see is new  Yet not the pride of sudden elevation  Swells my full heart but gratitude to thee  These splendid ornaments and this gay scene  Attract my wonder but inspire not joy  'Tis he the fond dispenser of them all  'Tis Nouradin alone that gives them value  And makes them pleasing to Amana's eyes  Nouradin  O were the flaming mines where diamonds grow  With all of wealth and grandeur in my power  How poorly should I estimate the gift  Compared to that which I receive from thee  Amana  Too highly dost thou rate so slight a prize  For poor Amana's heart is all her treasure  There humblest duty joined with tenderest love  And grateful sentiment shall ever dwell  For thee my lord my lover husband friend  Nouradin  Transporting charmer generous to excess  But words are feeble to express my sense  Here then I make a solemn vow that tho'  kneeling  Our law admits plurality of wives  Thy Nouradin's sincere and faithful heart  Shall never wander from Amana's charms  Nor feel the power of beauty but from her  The pride the pleasure of his future life  His whole of bliss below Who dares intrude  rising  Enter  CALED  and Guards  Nouradin  Unmannered slave what insolence to rush  Into my presence thus  Caled  Then know my errand  presenting the mandate  Nouradin  With reverence I receive the Caliph's mandate  reads  Caled  Can'st thou not read it Why dost tremble so  Arouse and be a manI did not strike thee  Thou first bereaved me of that precious beauty  I but repay thee justice for thy wrongs  Nouradin  Ten thousand daggers stick within my heart  Monster Barbarian Oh  drops the paper and  Caled  takes it up  Amana  Alas he faints  Quick let me fly to aid him  runs to him  Caled  Lovely maid  Thy tender cares must henceforth be bestowed  On one more worthy of thy charms The Sultan  In tedious languishment attends thy presence  And we must not delay  Amana  Oh never never  This world hath no exchange for Nouradin  Nouradin  Tear out my heart pluck all my limbs asunder  Wreak thy full vengeance on this wretched body  But spare Oh spare Amana  Amana  Nought but death  Shall ever wrest me from my love My father  Enter  ABDALLAH  Wilt thou not rescue me  Caled  Observe this mandate  to  Abdallah  Abdallah  Alas my child it is not in my power  Nouradin  Since wealth can bribe thee to an act of baseness  Let it for once inspire humanity  Take all that I possessexcepting her  Thou can'st not leave me poor  Caled  Were all thy wealth  Trebled a thousand fold nay were it more  Than even thought can number for it all  I'd not forego the joys I feel in vengeance  Now thou art answeredQuick prepare to part  I will indulge thee with a last embrace  Amana  They shall dismember me to loose this hold  Oh kill me sir and save me from dishonour  to her father  Abdallah  Oh my unhappy child thy father wishes  To see thee dead but cannot give the blow  Caled  Come madam to delay your bliss were vain  If you consent not force shall make you happy  lays hold of her  Nouradin  Oh do not hurt her tender limbs and I  Will quit my hold of her and life together  My loved my lost Amana  they force her off He falls  Abdallah  Curst be this clime and doubly cursed its Prophet  For whose false faith I left the only true  At once abandoned heaven and my country  Renounced both worlds for my Amestris' charms  O liberty thou first best gift to man  Bestowed in ParadiseNature's creation  Subject to him himself without controul  Except to heaven alone Thus thus derived  We claim it as our birthright Yet O shame  Whole nations have resigned this right divine  From heaven revolting yet submit to man  Albion alone preserves the blest Palladium  Where every power of doing good is free  And peasants may defend their rights from kings  A second Eden in religion also  In faith and practice purest among men  Yet I a renegade to each advantage  Tho' born a Briton bred a Christian too  My creed my country for a woman's love  Did forfeit True indeed my paradise  I have enjoyed belowBut vengeance sure  Tho' slow hath now o'erta'en and my Amana  Is marked a victim for her father's crime  Yet still just heaven If sin may be attoned  kneels  By deep contrition weigh my penitence  Nor shed the parent's guilt upon the child  Oh rather let me live while nature's powers  Admit existence in that life be cursed  With pain with penury with every ill  To vex the mind or torture human sense  Extend those evils to my latest gasp  And purge my apostasy with wounds and death  Nouradin  Why did I part with her Why not sustain  starting up  The Sultan's cruelty and Caled's vengeance  Oh had they hewed me piecemeal what could they  Have done but kill'd me And I now must suffer  A thousand thousand deaths But fear for her  Unmanned my nature quiteFor in the strife  They might have injured her There there I died  Torn from my bleeding heart where is she now  Perhaps encircled in the Caliph's arms  Abdallah  Stay that ungenerous thoughttho' born a slave  My daughter ever hath been bred a Briton  Nor will she condescend to live on terms  Which her chaste soul abhorsFrom earliest youth  She has been taught to know that life is dowerless  Without virtue stript of that rich portion  One lot alone remainsto die with honour  Therefore believe Amana still a virgin  Or no more  Nouradin  Why dost thou seek to aggravate my sorrows  I hoped Amana's heart might be at peace  That wealth that grandeur might have bought her smiles  And left me only wretchedOh 'tis false  Vile treason against love That heavenly maid  Within this hour declared she only lived  For NouradinThen let me instant fly  To save her from pollution this good sword  Lodge deep in Osmin's breastor in my own  Abdallah  My son attend A thought has quick occurred  Which may perhaps redeem us from despair  The captain of the guards his name is Hamet  Was once a well tried friend of mine honest  Sincere and brave strict bound in gratitude  For services no matter now to tell  And if the modes of court have not erased  All generous feelings from his aged breast  He will both pity and assist our purpose  Should he but lend his aid I yet have hope  Of rescuing Amana from perdition  But oh he never felt a father's anguish  Nor did his heart e'er bleed as mine does now  Nouradin  O lose not time in fruitless doubts or fears  But fly this moment and strong urge your suit  Use every argument that thought can frame  To bind him to our friendship if my wealth  Can buy his service let him take it all  And pay me with one sight of my Amana  Abdallah  Thou need'st not seek to press a father's haste  To save an only child for tho' no raptures  Now fire my blood like yours more generous passions  Rage 'gainst oppression with parental fondness  Have made my heart as brave as his who dares  The cannon's roar in battle But my son  Know that the adventure is most hazardous  Therefore with caution let us now proceed  Entreating heaven to bless the pious deed  And if we fail I am prepared to bleed  End of the  Second Act  ACT III  SCENE NARDIC  's Apartment  Enter  NARDIC  Nardic  WHAT strong impatience agitates my mind  Would Caled were arrived I long yet dread  To view this promised maid upon whose charms  Depends my life or death Oh the mean slavery  Of proud dependence How contemptuous seem  All power all greatness which we poorly borrow  From another's smiles or purchase basely  With office servile or with treachery buy  Strange state of man to be or slave or tyrant  Is there no  mean  condition holy prophet  Are all then born for one No way to blend  Prerogative with liberty To poise  In equal scales the prince and people's rights  And make them mutually suspend each other  Enter  CALED  leading in  Amana  veiled  Caled  Now let thy servant's truth be fully proved  Behold the fair Amana  Nardic  Her shape and stature vouch in part thy praise  Her face I hope will certify the rest  takes off her veil  scendent charmer dry those falling tears  A  d let thy lovely eyes be decked in smiles  To  reet thy coming greatness happiest  As fairest of thy sex I hail thee queen  prostrates himself before her  And here devote my future life and service  To the commands of our bright Sultaness  The fair Amana  Amana  O detested flattery  Offspring of meanness and ambition fostered  In courts luxuriant soil for every vice  To thrive and flourish in Know I disdain  The Sultan and his greatness If indeed  Thou mean'st thy kind professions for my service  O give me back to a fond father's arms  To a despairing husband's bleeding heart  Or with thy poignard set my own at rest  Nardic  Alas bright maid thy youth and inexperience  Have much deceived thee and thou know'st not yet  The joys superior which attend on greatness  Soon

wholly won e'er she  Beheld the mighty Osmin given away  By sacred contract to a lovely youth  And this day was to have solemnized our nuptials  But for the treachery of a barbarous slave  Then let not him for whom fond beauties sigh  Retain the furtive prize of villainy  But quick restore her to the virtuous ties  Of filial duty and of wedded love  Osmin  Arisebut be assured thou plead'st in vain  The tenderness of thy complaint hath moved me  But not to pitySince thou can'st feel love  Why not sustain its pleasing pains for me  Thou art not formed of coarse plebeian mould  Too delicate to sill a vassal's arms  I would preserve thy passion in its force  But thou must learn to change the happy object  The task is easy from my own experience  For I have loved beforeand now love thee  Amana  As well might'st thou command sweet flowers to grow  On the tempestuous sea as force true love  To change its object 'Tis impossible  From one strong stem rooted in both our hearts  Our passions bloomed at once reciprocal  Thy breath may blast the fruit but ne'er thy hand  Reap the ripe harvest Then O mighty Sultan  If ever thou dost hope to taste the joys  Of mutual love O let my streaming eyes  And lifted hands procure my reconveyance  Or if thou enviest him this poor possession  Quick let my death destroy his hopes with thine  Osmin  Thou shalt not die nor will I part with thee  But know the slave for whom thy fondness pleads  Shall bleed within thy sight if in the space  Of two revolving suns thou yieldest not  To gratify my wish with soft compliance  'Tis thy own

neck where I  Should fold my grateful arms to death devote him  Rather than wound his image in my heart  Or stain that mirror with a second object  Osmin  Beware and stop thy heedless tongue lest I

not that  He is too much enamoured of her charms  To quit the fond pursuit the power of beauty  Had never such effect upon his heart  Since first I marked the movement of his passions  Besides his restive pride will scorn to yield  And force is ready should persuasion fail  He has allowed a respite of two days  To abate her grief and tune her soul to joy  While as he knows his own unbridled will  Which like a whirlwind bears down all before it  He hath withdrawn himself from the serrail  To waste the tedious space in solitude  At  The plain of the Mummies near Kairo  Sakara upon the bank

growth outstrips its slender girth  Each blast alarms me and I shrink my head  Old Hamet's well earned post and long worn honours  He hath resigned with silence and submission  Unlike a soldier

hope  Again be thineThe friend I told thee of  Hath proved his worth and with his utmost power  Hath promised to assist the bold adventure  Therefore prepare to quit this cursed land  Where tyranny is law and innocence  Can find no safety but in hasty flight  If we succeed in rescuing Amana  My native country shall afford us refuge  But if successless in the brave attempt  Our solace be that we

Abdallah  Know then the tyrant whether thro' compassion  Or still in hope to soothe her to compliance  Hath granted her two days to wean her sorrow  To conquer nature and submit to fate  During which interval he hath retired  To Sakara whence like an epicure  Fasting from beauty to increase appetite  He like an hungry glatton may return  And feast his quickened sense with fuller gust  Nouradin  O

captain of his guard now subaltern  To impious Caled from a twofold reason  Impelled by friendship's ties and just disdain  On being thus disgraced to pay the hire  Of hellish deeds of rape and treachery  Will introduce thee in the Sultan's robes  His yearly perquisite at dusk of even  To the seraglio to Amana's ward  From whence by means which Hamet shall direct  Thou may'st descend into

to the softness of a seraph  Nouradin  Were but my life my happiness at stake  Well might'st thou doubt the weakness of my virtue  Against Amana's charmsBut where her safety  Becomes the question I can turn a stoic  Scarcely indulge my ravished eyes to gaze  Or raptured hand to feast upon her touch  'Till I restore her to her father's arms  Abdallah  O may the blessings of a mutual love  Light

Is but a child indeedA playful god  His darts unvenomed and unnerved his arm  Not so he took possession of my heart  But shot himself with his whole train of ills  Into my glowing breast thou happy fair  Wert formed to inspire the passion in its rage  Thy heart insensible to all its pangs  Amana  Alas thou art deceived Amana's heart  Feels all the fond solicitudes of love  But then it was thy chaste thy generous passion  Unhappy Nouradin that lighted up  The flame in my cold bosom which with life  Alone shall be extinguished  Fatima  Hapless maid  Here I return thy pity twenty fold  Alas thou art more wretched than myself  I have but one concernwith mutual warmth  To inspire the Sultan's breastwhile doubly vexed  Thou hast a love debarred and one to shun  The Caliph's fate and mine exact the same  Pursuing fled from meeting hate for love  Amana  Curst be his passion curst his vicious love  And doubly curst the hour he saw Amana  Oh that deformity would spread its veil  Over

mean wretch unhappy  But cannot make me blestEven in my arms  The adverse fair will sigh for Nouradin  And curse the tyrant for the unwilling joy  Nardic  And what avail her curses while her charms  Shall gratify my sovereign's fond desire  And feast his every sense  Osmin  Awayaway  I am surfeited of sense want higher gust  Which love reciprocal alone can yield  Oh must I never taste the fond embrace  Of mutual love The ardour ne'er behold  Of unfeigned passion modesty alone  That brightest ornament of female beauty  Restraining its excess Must I ne'er see  The half denying half consenting glance  Steal from Amana's eye I may possess  But not enjoy her charmsDull feast  To gorge a clovefoot satyr's appetite  O that I could transform my outward semblance  And take the shape and garb of Nouradin  Then might I feel the true extatic joy  Of being pressed with transport to the heart  Of this too lovely but capricious fair  The very thought inspires an half enjoyment  Nardic  Then why not practise the deceit my liege  I have seen this Nouradin when late he came  To sue a licence out for Mecca's shrine  Whither his filial piety and duty  Inclined him to perform a pilgrimage  In zeal and honour of his father's shade  He seemed a comely youth in face and person  Resembling much my prince The least disguise  In the dun shades of night might gratify  My sovereign's present wish thy fond embrace  Would fill her arms as well as Nouradin  'Twill make her happy during the delusion  And save a world of virgin coyness then  If she be woman she'll forgive the cheat  And bless the artifice that saved her shame  Osmin  Haste thensupply me with a merchant's garb  This night I'll play Amphytrion absolved  By gods who smile at the fond frauds of love  I'll enter the seraglio steal

sanctified by Hymen's virtuous bands  "Thus thus w'ell disappoint the tyrant's hope"  O the transcending joy I then shall feel  When full possessing all she can bestow  I let her know 'tis Osmin she has blessed  And like another Jove confound her sense  With my full blaze of glory  Nardic  I am charmed  At this fair scene which opens to thy view  Such happy thefts exceed those dull enjoyments  Which willing beauty yields This key conveys  My royal master thro' the palace gates  Unseen by all his guards Within an hour  I will provide a dress to suit the intent  Exact the same that bridegrooms wear for such  We must suppose was Nouradin's this morn  When habited in form to espouse the fair  And may success attend my sovereign's will  Equal to his and Nardic's mutual wish  exit

bright chariot for a day  I'd plunge the world in deep and sudden darkness  Nor ask for light but from Amana's eyes  Like him too once to obtain my soul's ambition  I'd hazard mine and this whole globe's existence  For I in truth could never yet believe  Our lying Imans or their flattering prophet  All that I know of bliss I will enjoy  And leave the rest to chance or destiny  exit  SCENE NOURADIN's  House  Enter  NOURADIN  in the Sultan's Robes with  HAMET  and  ABDALLAH  Hamet  My friends I have risqued my life to aid your cause  And much I fear but more I hope the event  These robes of royalty sit easy on thee  And as thou bearest a likeness to the Sultan  The guards will ne'er suspect the masquerade  But should the least suspicion chance to arise  In any of the watch deep plunge this dagger  In his heart and speed thy course in silence  Nouradin  If there be such a deity as love  He will protect and guide me to Amana  For sure a fonder votary ne'er bowed  Before his altar in the Cyprian isle  Night too will be my friend accustomed still  To smile on lovers she will not refuse  Her aid to Nouradin My beating heart  Bounds with prophetic rapture I shall yet  Retrieve the angelic maid from soul offence  And make her future life one scene of bliss  Abdallah  I would not wish to damp thy virtuous hope  But much I dread there is an heavy cloud  Hangs o'er our heads to shower down evils on us  My cursed apostasy hath brought this ruin  On my illfated house and my Amana  With you my son tho' innocent may suffer  For my impietySo heaven decrees  Nouradin  What means Abdallah  Abdallah  In the distracted moment when my child  Was deemed a sacrifice to brutal lust  And torn from thy despairing arms and mine  I told thee of my country and religion  And oh I told thee  Nouradin  I do remember something like a dream  While on the ground in agony I lay  You talked methought in wild phantastic vision  Of lands of freedom of a purer faith  And judgments visited for sins derived  Abdallah  To thee my son I might appear to rave  Born as thou art beneath a tyrant's yoke  And early taught to bend thy passive neck  To arbitrary sway The mountain goddess  Hath never deigned to mark her footsteps here  Nor yet hath heaven its saving grace extended  To lands of despotism and gross imposture  But what I tremble for is lest the charms  Of my Amestris opening in their prime  In my Amana may perhaps induce  The curse of disobedience to our law  Hamet  Let not thy timorous faith forebode such ills  Nor sink the spirit of our bold emprize  For thee or me the muddy dregs of life  Are scarcely worth the draught A nauseous potion  Therefore without repining at the past  With calmness let us wait the pregnant future  And whether death or freedom be our lot  Let us receive the alternative like men  Abdallah  My friends I fear not for myself my life  Hath filled its years and like a full fed guest  I'd gladly quit the banquet and depend  On penitence sincere for future bliss  But oh I dread lest those much dearer to me  Than all the joys of earth combined may starve  Like dowerless children of a spendthrift father  For my extravagance and luxury  Nouradin  Forbear these sad reflectionsIf high heaven  Whose justice with the tenderest mercy tempered  Presides o'er all its works if it regard  The ways of man its justice will pronounce  Amana mine and in its goodness will  Restore her to my fond and faithful arms  Hamet  Prophetic be thy hopeThis silver key  The last remaining badge of Hamet's greatness  None but the mighty Nardic hath another  And he most luckily attends the Sultan  Will open every gate within the palace  Beneath the garden wall we'll wait for thee  If thou escapest we shall be free if not  This dagger shall release my bondsFarewel  exit  Nouradin  The servent blessings of a grateful heart  Raised from the depth of sorrow into joy  Dwell ever round thee and protect thy age  looking after him  But why that heavy gloom upon thy brow  Illboding to our hopes as low'ring clouds  In days of harvest to the rural swain  to  Abdallah  Abdallah  From threescore years of tedious disappointment  I have been taught that hope is the true curse  Of Tantalus and when the flattering draught  Seems just to touch our lips some sullen sprite  Dashes the stream aside and makes us feel  Our griefs increased by bordering on joy  Therefore I bid thy inexperience fear  Nouradin  Thy philosophic lore I'll strive to learn  When my tumultuous passions are at peace  Then only can it rule the human heart  The rudder's useless in a storm must yield  To raging billows and resistless winds  Whilst the scared pilot stands in mute despair  But to our holy prophet here I kneel  To bless my little bark with prosperous gales  Let but Amana be the precious freight  No other treasure shall I wish on board  Or care what course we steerPossessed of her  All climes all nations are the same to me  Wheree'er she smiles a paradise

fear  I ne'er again shall know  Amana  Do not despair  When the first tumults of the Caliph's rage  For my escape are past then may'st thou hope  By arts of soothing tenderness once more  To steal into his heart and win his love  By soft indulgence to his present passion  Thou may'st revive the former in his breast  And thus regain the empire thou hast lost  She who would please proud man must not disdain  The lowest methods to attain her purpose  Humility's the garb in which their sex  The most delight to see us dressedBy this  Their vain superiority is shewn  And our dependent state upon their wills  Fatima  Thy calm expressions raise my utmost wonder  Thou can'st not surely mean to die e'er long  Yet talk with such reflection and composure  Amana  My soul is fixed and therefore am I calm  Did hope or fear perplex this constant breast  The strong emotions could not be concealed  What can I hope from lust and tyranny  Or what have I to fear who in that hour  When I was forced from my fond husband's arms  Lost the last glimpse of happiness below  For thee alone my generous Nouradin  And my unhappy father do I feel  O Fatima this thought hath roused sensations  Which I could wish

me a poor two days  And is this pittance now curtailed to half  But what's a day a week a year to me  Whose fate's already fixed and soul resolved  Then why should I resent this breach of faith  Or start at hastening from the griefs I feel  And speeding to the land of peace and rest  Retire a while I shall obey the Sultan  Attendant retires to the back of the scene  Now now Amana summon all thy courage  What means this chilling damp that clings around me  Why do I tremble thus my tottering limbs  Why should they now refuse their wonted aid  A little longer and I shall not want it  But pale and cold stretched on my parent earth  No longer be a burthen to myself  Can love of life have power o'er the unhappy  Or shall a wretch who languishes in prison  Refuse to be set free The instinctive voice  Perhaps of nature pleads too strongly here  And silences the stiller pleas of virtue  But cannot love inspire my timid sex  Shall I be led a willing sacrifice  To gratify a mean and gross desire  O never Death has lost its terrors now  This cordial draught shall lead me to his arms  To peace and Nouradin  drinks  'Tis done and now  Fear hope and every passion of the soul  Are all extinct but loveThat still remains  And in my latest moments will prevail  In prayers and blessings on my Nouradin  What strengthening power hath braced my sinews thus  'Tis love 'tis hope 'tis immortality  Lavinia comeAttend me to the Sultan  exeunt  SCENE  The Pavilion The Stage darkened  NOURADIN  alone  Enter  AMANA  and  Attendant  the latter retires  Nouradin  Approach my fair nor longer now delay  Thy suppliant monarch's bliss whose fond impatience  Hath urged him to infringe his royal word  And make a sacrifice to love transcending far  What he requests from thee Reduce him not  To win by force what he would owe to favour  Believe me the rich bounties of thy love  Shall not be spent on my sole luxury  But treasured in my heart to be repaid  With grateful use to purchase joys for thee  Amana  Banish those vicious hopes and know that I  Nor dread thy power nor supplicate thy pity  Thou see'st no more the weeping trembling maid  Who late implored thy graceBut one who comes  To dare thy rage and prove its impotence  Nouradin  Whence comes this boast What means the frantic fair  Amana  She means to pour out her whole soul before thee  Its love its hate without disguise or fear  To curse thee tyrant from her wounded heart  And breathe forth fervent wishes for thy rival  May every joy of which thou hast deprived him  Be doubled tenfold by all gracious heaven  May long and happy days attend him here  And may we meet again in that blest place  Where tyrants ne'er can come to part us more  Nouradin  Thy prayers are prophesies my virtuous bride  Behold thy fondest wishes are fulfilled  And underneath this hated garb thou see'st  The happy Nouradin O let me press  Thy constant heart close to his faithful breast  Amana  Oh  shrieks and faints  Nouradin  She faints the strong surprize hath overpowered  Her delicate and agitated frame  Awake my loveMy soul's immortal joy  Revive and bless me with a look a word  Amana  Oh Nouradin fly fly this hated place  Nouradin  Come let me bear thee in these longing arms  Convey thee quick from out these cursed walls  And give thee back to love and liberty  Amana  Alas my bounds are set I ne'er shall quit  This fatal spot 'till soul and body part  Nouradin  Dost thou indeed refuse to go with me  Has bondage then such charms or has thy tongue  Belied thy heart in feigning generous love  To enhance thy sacrifice to princely grandeur  Amana  O cease to wound me by unkind suspicion  My heart is wholly thineThe last sad drops  It e'er shall weep will be fond tears for thee  Nouradin  Why then thou angel maid wilt thou provoke  Our adverse fate by this illtimed delay  Amana  Alas I fear to tell what must be known  For now ten thousand fires rage in my bosom  Oh Nouradin  Nouradin  I am on the rack what mean these strong convulsions  Speak quickly my heart's loveI am all distraction  Amana  That pang is past and if my strength will hold  I'll tell thee the sad tale of woe  Nouradin  O stay  Whilst thou hast ease let me convey thee hence  Amana  Alas my love it is impossible  Death riots in my veins  Nouradin  Death Said you death  Amana  Too sure he has possession of my heart  Thy only rival there O Nouradin  He grasps me hard wilt thou not struggle with him  Nouradin  I would contend with the united world  To save my more than life But say O say  How camest thou thus I press yet dread to know  Amana  When torn from thee and my unhappy father  And led a captive to the foul serrail  I firm resolved to die e'er flames impure  Should blast this shrine hallowed to love and thee  A rival sultaness approved my vow  And whether moved by jealousy or pity  Supplied the deadly draught which late I drank  When summoned to attend the tyrant's will  In this lewd scene of infamy and vice  Now now I feel its baneful influence  Too strong for mortal powers  Nouradin  O holy prophet  Exchange my life for her's  Amana  O Nouradin  Forgive this fatal rashnessHad I staid  A few short moments we had now been blest  But wresting from the hand of providence  The means of my escape we both are wretched  But love and virtue called and here resigned  I fall a sacrifice to heaven and thee  Oh  dies  Nouradin  Speak on tho' every word thy lips may utter  Be daggers hereYet O Speak on and live  And art thou silent then Shall I ne'er hear  Thy tender tuneful voice once more Nay then  No other mournful tale shall ever vex  My wounded ear or grieve my tortured breast  Thus from all future anguish am I free  My life my soul shall follow my Amana  stabs himself and dies  Enter  NARDIC  and  FATIMA  with Lights  HAMET  and  ABDALLAH  guarded  Nardic  The Sultan's slainSecure those hoary traitors  The rack shall force them to reveal their crimes  What's here Another Osmin dead and by him  The fair Amana  Abdallah  O my unhappy children  Hamet  Then all is at an endNow Nardic know  I plotted not the Caliph's death but sought  That maid's release and in those royal robes  I gained admittance for that injured youth  How heaven hath countermined our honest purpose  I cannot say but this I know that I  Am ready to resign a life which both  My years and this world's base ingratitude  Have now made stale and absynth to my sense  Nardic  Convey him to the dungeon and the wheel  Dost thou know aught of this sad tragedy  to  Fatima  Fatima  My strong remorse alas too plainly shews  I am in part an actor in this scene  Tho' wholly guiltless of the Sultan's death  How far concerned in this catastrophé  When the fierce passions which now tear my soul  Will give me leave I shall with truth relate  Abdallah  O turn your vengeance on this guilty wretch  'Tis I am the curst source of all these sorrows  My darling child that now lies dead before you  Was sacrificed by meCurse on this head  And these grey hairs which have involved you both  In guilt like mine  kneeling over the dead bodies  Nardic  Thy wretchedness old man  Hath turned thy brainHow could thy feeble arm  Have power to bring these dread events to pass  Abdallah  Not mine indeed but heaven's avenging hand  Hath struck this heavy blowThe Sultan's vice  Hath earned his fateFor tyranny should bleed  But these unhappy innocents were doomed  For my foul crimes my vile apostasy  For quitting heaven and native liberty  Let those who dwell in Albion's happy land  Grateful acknowledge heaven's most bounteous hand  Its choicest boon in freedom is bestowed  And their best praise to its protector owed  Who not in Britain's cause alone sustains  The toils of council and of hostile plains  The world's great champion born for all mankind  In whom the oppressed a certain refuge find  Whose sword but like the lancet wounds to heal  Where moral lenitives can nought avail  Whose olive bearing laurel peace restores  And calms the discord of contending powers  FINIS
