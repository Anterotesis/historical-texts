 THE STATE of the WAR AND THE NECESSITY OF AN Augmentation  THE PRESENT STATE OF THE WAR AND THE NECESSITY OF AN Augmentation CONSIDER'D  LONDON  Printed and sold by  J Morphew  near  Stationers Hall    PREFACE  THE Author of the following Essay has endeavoured to draw into one continued Scheme the whole State of the present War and the Methods that appear to him the most proper for bringing it to a happy Conclusion  After having considered that the  French  are the constant and most dangerous Enemies to the  British  Nation and that the Danger from them is now greater than ever and will still increase till their present Ʋnion with  Spain  be broken he sets forth the several Advantages which this Ʋnion has already given  France  and taken from  Great Britain  in relation to the  WestIndies  the Wollen Manufacture the Trade of the  Levant  and the Naval Power of the Two Nations  He shews how these Advantages will still rise higher after a Peace notwithstanding our  present Conquests with new Additions shou'd be confirmed to us as well because the Monarchy of  Spain  wou'd not be weakened by such Concessions as because no Guarantee cou'd be found sufficient to secure them to us For which Reasons he lays it down as a fixt Rule That no Peace is to be made without an entire Disunion of the  French  and  Spanish  Monarchies  That this may be brought about he endeavours to prove from the Progress we have already made towards it and the Successes we have purchased in the present War which are very considerable if well pursued but of no effect if we acquiesce in them  In order to compleat this Disunion in which we have gone so far he wou'd not have us relie upon exhausting the  French  Treasury attempts on the  Spanish Indies  Descents on  France  but chiefly upon outnumbring them in Troops  France  being already drained of her best Supplies and the Confederates Masters of much greater Forces for Multitude and Strength both in Men and Horse and provided with Generals of greater Fame and Abilities  He then considers the wrong Measures we have hitherto taken in making too small Levies after a successful Campaign in Regulating their number by that of the Enemys Forces and Hiring them of our Confederates shewing at the same time the Inconveniencies we suffer from such hir'd Troops and several Advantages we might receive from Employing those of our own Nation  He further  this Augmentation of our Forces to  the keeping up a Standing Body of  times of Peace to enable us to make an Impression on the Enemy in the present Posture of the War and to secure our selves against a Prince who is now at the Head of a powerful Army and has not yet declared himself  In the last place he answers by several Considerations those two Popular Objections That we furnish more towards the War than the rest of the Allies and that we are not able to contribute more than we do already  These are the most material Heads of the following Essay in which there are many other subordinate Reflections that naturally grow out of so copious a Subject  THE PRESENT STATE OF THE WAR AND THE NECESSITY OF AN Augmentation CONSIDER'D  THE  French  are certainly the most implacable and the most dangerous Enemys of the  British  Nation Their Form of Government their Religion their Jealousy of the  British  Power as well as their Prosecutions of Commerce and Pursuits  of Universal Monarchy will fix them for ever in their Animosities and Aversions towards us and make them catch at all Opportunities of subverting our Constitution destroying our Religion ruining our Trade and sinking the Figure which we make among the Nations of  Europe  Not to mention the particular Ties of Honour that lie on their present King to impose on us a Prince who must prove fatal to our Country if he ever reigns over us  As we are thus in a natural State of War if I may so call it with the  French  Nation it is our Misfortune that they are not only the most inveterate but most formidable of our Enemies and have the greatest Power as well as the strongest Inclination to ruin us No other State equals them in the Force of their Fleets and Armies in the Nearness and Conveniency of their Situation and in the Number of Friends and Wellwishers which it is to be fear'd they have among us  For these Reasons our Wars with  France  have always affected us in our most tender Interests and concern'd us more than those we have had with any other Nation but I  may venture to say This Kingdom was never yet engag'd in a War of so great consequence as that which now lies upon our hands Our All is at stake and irretrievably lost if we fail of Success At other times if a War ended in a dishonourable Peace or with equal Loss we cou'd comfort our selves with the hopes of a more favourable Juncture that might set the Ballance right or turn it to our Advantage We had still the prospect of forming the same Alliance or perhaps strengthning it with new Confederacies and by that means of trying our Fortune a second time in case the Injustice or Ambition of the Enemy forc'd us into the Field At present if we make a Drawn Game of it or procure but Moderate advantages we are in a Condition which every  British  Heart must tremble at the thought of There are no second Trials no Wars in reserve no new Schemes of Alliance to which we can have recourse Should the  French  King be able to bear down such an united Force as now makes head against him at a time when  Spain  affords him no greater Assistance what will he do when the Trade of the  Levant  lies at  his Mercy when the whole Kingdom of  Spain  is supply'd with his Manufactures and the Wealth of the  Indies  flows into his Coffers and what is yet worse when this additional Strength must arise in all its particulars from a proportionable Decay in the States that now make War upon him It is no wonder therefore that our late King of Glorious Memory who by the Confession of his greatest Enemies was a Prince that perfectly understood the Interests of  Europe  should in his last Speech recommend to his Parliament the declaring War against  France  in those memorable Words  You have yet an Opportunity by God's blessing to secure to you and your Posterity the quiet Enjoyment of your Religion and Liberties if you are not wanting to your selves but will exert the antient Vigour of the  English  Nation but I tell you plainly my Opinion is if you do not lay hold on this occasion you have no reason to hope for another  We have already a dreadful Proof of the Increase of Power that accrues to  France  from its Conjunction with  Spain  So expensive a War as that which the  French  Monarchy hath  been carrying on in so many and so remote Parts at once must long since have drain'd and exhausted all its Substance had there not been several secret Springs that swell'd their Treasury from time to time in proportion as the War has sunk it The King's Coffers have been often reduced to the lowest Ebb but have still been seasonably refresh'd by frequent and unexpected Supplies from the  Spanish America  We hear indeed of the Arrival but of very few Ships from those Parts but as in every Vessel there is Stowage for immense Treasures when the Cargo is pure Bullion or Merchandize of as great a Value so we find by Experience they have had such prodigious Sums of Money convey'd to them by these secret Channels that they have been enabled to pay more numerous Armies than they ever had on foot before and that at a time when their Trade fails in all its other Branches and is distress'd by all the Arts and Contrivances of their neighbouring Nations During the last four Years by a modest Computation there have been brought into  Brest  above six Millions of Pounds Sterling in Bullion What then shall we suppose wou'd  be the effect of this Correspondence with  America  might the Wealth of those Parts come to them on Squadrons of Men of War and Fleets of Galeons If these little Bycurrents that creep into the Country by Stealth have so great a Force how shall we stem the whole Torrent when it breaks in upon us with its full Violence And this certainly will be our Case unless we find a Means to dissolve the Union between  France  and  Spain  I have dwelt the longer on this Consideration because the present War hath already furnish'd us with the Experiment and sensibly convinc'd us of the Increase of Power which  France  has receiv'd from its Intercourse with the  Spanish WestIndies  As there are many who look upon every thing which they don't actually see and feel as bare Probability and Speculation I shall only touch on those other Reasons of which we have already also had some Experience for our preventing this Coalition of Interests and Designs in the two Monarchies  The Woollen Manufacture is the  British  Strength the staple Commodity and proper Growth of our Country if this fails us our Trade and Estates must sink together  and all the Cash of the Nation be consumed on Foreign Merchandize The  French  at present gain very much upon us in this great Article of our Trade and since the Accession of the  Spanish  Monarchy supply with Cloath of their own making the very best Mart we had in  Europe  And what a melancholy Prospect have we if ever a Peace gives them leave to enrich their Manufacture with Mixtures of  Spanish  Wool to multiply the Hands employ'd in it to improve themselves in all the Niceties of the Art and to vend their Wares in those Places where was the greatest Consumption of our Woollen Works and the most considerable Gain for the  British  Merchant Notwithstanding our many seasonable Recruits from  Portugal  and our Plantations we already complain of our want of Bullion and must at last be reduc'd to the greatest Exigencies if this great Source be dry'd up and our Traffick with  Spain  continue under its present Discouragement  The Trade of the  Levant  must likewise flourish or decay in our Hands as we are Friends or Enemies of the  Spanish  Monarchy The late Conquest of  Naples  will  very little alter the case though  Sicily  should follow the Fate of her Sister Kingdom The  Streight  's Mouth is the Key of the  Levant  and will be always in the Possession of those who are Kings of  Spain  We may only add that the same Causes which streighten the  British  Commerce will naturally enlarge the  French  and that the Naval Force of either Nation will thrive or languish in the same degree as their Commerce gathers or loses Strength And if so powerful and populous a Nation as that of  France  become superior to us by Sea our whole is lost and we are no more a People The Consideration of so narrow a Channel betwixt us of such Numbers of regular Troops on the Enemy's side of so small a standing Force on our own and that too in a Country destitute of all such Forts and strong Places as might stop the Progress of a victorious Army hath something in it so terrifying that one does not care for setting it in its proper Light Let it not therefore enter into the Heart of any one that hath the least Zeal for his Religion or Love of Liberty that hath any regard either to the Honour or Safety of his Country or a well  Wish for his Friends or Posterity to think of a Peace with  France  till the  Spanish  Monarchy be entirely torn from it and the House of  Bourbon  disabled from ever giving the Law to  Europe  Let us suppose that the  French  King would grant us the most advantageous Terms we can desire without the Separation of the two Monarchies they must infallibly end in our Destruction Shou'd he secure to us all our present Acquisitions shou'd he add two or three FrontierTowns to what we have already in  Flanders  shou'd he join the Kingdoms of  Sicily  and  Sardinia  to  Milan  and  Naples  shou'd he leave King  Charles  in the peaceable Possession of  Catalonia  shou'd he make over to  Great Britain  the Town and Harbour of  Cadis  as well as that of  Gibraltar  and at the same time resign his Conquests in  Portugal  it wou'd all be of no effect towards the common Safety of  Europe  while the Bulk of the  Spanish  Continent and the Riches of  America  remain in the Possession of the  Bourbon  Family  Boccalini  when he weighs the States of  Europe  in his Political Balance after having laid  France  in one Scale throws  Spain  into the  other which wanted but very little of being a Counterpoise The  Spaniards  upon this says he begun to promise themselves the Honour of the Ballance reckoning that if  Spain  of it self weigh'd so well they cou'd not fail of Success when the several Parts of the Monarchy were lump'd in the same Scale Their Surprise was very great when upon the throwing in of  Naples  they saw the Scale rise and was greater still when they found that  Milan  and  Flanders  had the same effect The truth of it is these parts of the  Spanish  Monarchy are rather for Ornament than Strength They furnish out Viceroyalties for the Grandees and Posts of Honour for the Noble Families but in a time of War are Incumbrances to the main Body of the Kingdom and leave it naked and expos'd by the great number of Hands they draw from it to their Defence Shou'd we therefore continue in the Possession of what we have already made our selves Masters with such Additions as have been mentioned we shou'd have little more than the Excrescencies of the  Spanish  Monarchy The Strength of it will still join it self to  France  and grow the closer to it by its Disunion from the rest And in this case  the Advantages which must arise to that People from their intimate Alliance with the remaining part of the  Spanish  Dominions wou'd in a very few Years not only repair all the Damages they have sustained in the present War but fill the Kingdom with more Riches than it hath yet had in its most flourishing Periods  The  French  King hath often enter'd on several expensive Projects on purpose to dissipate the Wealth that is continually gathering in his Coffers in times of Peace He hath employ'd immense Sums on Architecture Gardening WaterWorks Painting Statuary and the like to distribute his Treasures among his People as well as to humour his Pleasures and his Ambition But if he once engrosses the Commerce of the  Spanish Indies  whatever Quantities of Gold and Silver stagnate in his private Coffers there will be still enough to carry on the Circulation among his Subjects By this means in a short space of time he may heap up greater Wealth than all the Princes of  Europe  join'd together and in the present Constitution of the World Wealth and Power are but different Names for the same thing Let us therefore suppose that after eight or ten Years of Peace he hath  a mind to infringe any of his Treaties or invade a neighbouring State to revive the Pretensions of  Spain  upon  Portugal  or attempt the taking those Places which were granted us for our Security what Resistance what Opposition can we make to so formidable an Enemy Shou'd the same Alliance rise against him that is now in War with him what cou'd we hope for from it at a time when the States engag'd in it will be comparatively weaken'd and the Enemy who is now able to keep them at a stand will have receiv'd so many new Accessions of Strength  But I think it is not to be imagin'd that in such a Conjuncture as we here suppose the same Confederates or any other of equal Force cou'd be prevail'd upon to join their Arms and endeavour at the pulling down so exorbitant a Power Some might be bought into his Interests by Money others drawn over by Fear and those that are liable to neither of these Impressions might not think their own Interest so much concern'd as in the present War or if any appear'd in a disposition to enter into such a Confederacy they might be crush'd separately before they cou'd concert Measures for their mutual Defence  The keeping together of the present Alliance can be ascribed to nothing else but the clear and evident Conviction which every Member of it is under that if it shou'd once break without having had its effect they can never hope for another Opportunity of reuniting or of prevailing by all the joint Efforts of such an Union Let us therefore agree on this as a fixt Rule and an inviolable Maxim never to lay down our Arms against  France  till we have utterly disjoyn'd her from the  Spanish  Monarchy Let this be the first Step of a publick Treaty the Basis of a general Peace  Had the present War indeed run against us and all our Attacks upon the Enemy been vain it might look like a degree of Frenzy or a Mixture of Obstinacy and Despair to be determin'd on so impracticable an Undertaking But on the contrary we have already done a great part of our Work and are come within view of the End that we have been so long driving at We remain victorious in all the Seats of War In  Flanders  we have got into our hands several open Countries rich Towns and fortified Places We have driven the Enemy out of all his Alliances dispossest him of his Strong Holds and  ruin'd his Allies in  Germany  We have not only recover'd what the Beginning of the War had taken from us but possest ourselves of the Kingdom of  Naples  the Dutchy of  Milan  and an Avenue of  France  in  Italy  The  Spanish  War hath given us a Haven for our Ships and the most populous and wealthy Province of that Kingdom In short we have taken all the outlying parts of the  Spanish  Monarchy and made Impressions upon the very Heart of it We have beaten the  French  from all their advanc'd Posts in  Europe  and driven them into their last Entrenchments One vigorous Push on all sides one general Assault will force the Enemy to cry out for Quarter and surrender themselves at discretion Another  Blenheim  or  Ramillies  will make the Confederates Masters of their own Terms and Arbitrators of a Peace  But notwithstanding the Advantages already gain'd are very considerable if we pursue them they will be of no effect unless we improve them towards the carrying of our main point The Enemy staggers if you follow your Blow he falls at your Feet but if you allow him respite he will recover his Strength and come upon you with greater Fury We have given  him several repeated Wounds that have enfeebl'd him and brought him low but they are such as time will heal unless you take advantage from his present Weakness to redouble your Attacks upon him It was a celebrated part in  Caesar  's Character and what comes home to our present purpose that he thought nothing at all was done while any thing remain'd undone In short we have been tugging a great while against the Stream and have almost weather'd our point a Stretch or two more will do the Work but if instead of that we slacken our Arms and drop our Oars we shall be hurried back in a moment to the place from whence we first set out  After having seen the Neecessity of an entire Separation of the Kingdoms of  France  and  Spain  our Subject naturally leads us into the Consideration of the most proper means for effecting it  We have a great while flatter'd ourselves with the prospect of reducing  France  to our own Terms by the want of Money among the People and the Exigencies of the publick Treasury but have been still disappointed by the great Sums imported from  America  and the many new Expedients which the Court hath found out for its Relief A long consumptive War is more likely to break the Grand Alliance than disable  France  from maintaining sufficient Armies to oppose it An arbitrary Government will never want Money so long as the People have it and so active a People will always have it whilst they can send what Merchandises they please to  Mexico  and  Peru  The  French  since their Alliance with  Spain  keep thirty Ships in constant Motion between the Western Ports of  France  and the South Seas of  America  The King himself is an Adventurer in this Traffick and besides the Share that he receives out of the Gains of his Subjects has immense Sums that come directly from it into his own Hands  We may further consider that the  French  since their abandoning  Bavaria  and  Italy  have very much retrench'd the Expence of the War and lay out among themselves all the Money that is consumed in it  Many are of Opinion that the most probable way of bringing  France  to Reason wou'd be by the making an Attempt upon the  Spanish WestIndies  and by that means to cut off all Communication  with this great Source of Riches or turn the Current of it into our own Country This I must confess carries so promising an appearance that I would by no means discourage the Attempt But at the same time I think it should be a collateral Project rather than our principal Design Such an Undertaking if well concerted and put into good Hands would be of infinite Advantage to the Common Cause but certainly an Enterprise that carries in it the Fate of  Europe  should not turn upon the Uncertainty of Winds and Waves and be liable to all the Accidents that may befal a Naval Expedition  Others there are that have long deceiv'd themselves with the hopes of an Insurrection in  France  and are therefore for laying out all our Strength on a Descent These I think do not enough consider the natural Love which the gross of Mankind have for the Constitution of their Fathers A Man that is not enlightned by Travail or Reflexion grows as fond of Arbitrary Power to which he hath been us'd from his Infancy as of cold Climates or barren Countries in which he hath been born and bred Besides there is a kind of sluggish Resignation as well as  poorness and degeneracy of Spirit in a state of Slavery that we meet with but very few who will be at the pains or danger of recovering themselves out of it as we find in History Instances of Persons who after their Prisons have been flung open and their Fetters struck off have chosen rather to languish in their Dungeons than stake their miserable Lives and Fortunes upon the Success of a Revolution I need not instance the general Fate of Descents the Difficulty of supplying Men and Provisions by Sea against an Enemy that hath both at hand and without which it is impossible to secure those Conquests that are often made in the first Onsets of an Invasion For these and other Reasons I can never approve the nursing up Commotions and Insurrections in the Enemy's Country which for want of the necessary Support are likely to end in the Massacre of our Friends and the Ruin of their Families  The only means therefore for bringing  France  to our Conditions and what appears to me in all human probability a sure and infallible Expedient is to throw in Multitudes upon 'em and overpower 'em with Numbers Would the Confederacy exert it self as much  to annoy the Enemy as they themselves for their Defence we might bear them down with the weight of our Armies and in one Summer overset the whole Power of  France  The  French  Monarchy is already exhausted of its best and bravest Subjects The Flower of the Nation is consum'd in its Wars The Strength of their Armies consists at present of such as have saved themselves by flight from some or other of the victorious Confederates and the only proper Persons to recruit them are but the Refuse of those who have been already pick'd out for the Service Mareschal  de Vauban  tho' infinitely partial in his Calculations of the Power of  France  reckons that the Number of its Inhabitants was two Millions less at the Peace of  Ryswick  than in the beginning of the War that was there concluded And tho' that War continued Nine Years and this hath as yet lasted but Six yet considering that their Armies are more strong and numerous that there hath been much more Action in the present War and that their Losses sustain'd in it have been very extraordinary we may by a moderate Computation suppose that the present War hath not been less prejudicial than the foregoing  one in the Ravage which it has made aamong the People There is in  France  so great a disproportion between the number of Males and Females and among the former between those who are capable of bearing Arms and such as are too young sickly or decrepit for the Service and at the same time such vast numbers of Ecclesiasticks Secular and Religious who live upon the Labours of others that when the several Trades and Professions are supply'd you will find most of those that are proper for War absolutely necessary for filling up the laborious part of Life and carrying on the Underwork of the Nation They have already contributed all their superfluous Hands and every new Levy they make must be at the Expence of their Farms and Vineyards their Manufactures and Commerce  On the contrary the Grand Alliance have innumerable Sources of Recruits not only in  Britain  and  Ireland  the  Ʋnited Provinces  and  Flanders  but in all the populous parts of  Germany  that have little Trade or Manufactures in proportion to the number of their Inhabitants We may add that the  French  have only  Switzerland  besides their own Country  to recruit in and we know the Difficulties they meet with in getting thence a single Regiment Whereas the Allies have not only the same Ressource but may be supply'd for Mony from  Denmark  and other Neutral States In short the Confederates may bring to the Field what Forces they please if they will be at the charge of 'em but  France  let her Wealth be what it will must content herself with the Product of her own Country  The  French  are still in greater streights for Supplies of Horse than Men The Breed of their Country is neither so good nor numerous as what are to be found in most of the Countries of the Allies They had last Summer about Threescore Thousand in their several Armies and cou'd not perhaps bring into the Field more if they were dispos'd to make such an Augmentation  The  French  Horse are not only few but weak in comparison of ours Their Cavalry in the Battle of  Blenheim  cou'd not sustain the Shock of the  British  Horse For this reason our late way of attacking their Troops Sword in Hand is very much to the Advantage of our Nation as our Men are more robust and our Horses of a stronger  Make than the  French  and in such Attacks it is the Weight of the Forces supposing equal Courage and Conduct that will always carry it The  English  Strength turn'd very much to account in our Wars against the  French  of old when we us'd to gall them with our long Bows at a greater Distance than they could shoot their Arrows This Advantage we lost upon the Invention of FireArms but by the present Method our Strength as well as Bravery may again be of use to us in the Day of Battle  We have very great Encouragement to send what Numbers we are able into the Field because our Generals at present are such as are likely to make the best use of them without throwing them away on any Rash Attempts or illconcerted Projects The Confederate Armies have the Happiness of being commanded by Persons who are esteem'd the greatest Leaders of the present Age and are perhaps equal to any that have preceded them There is a sort of Resemblance in their Characters A particular Sedateness in their Conversation and Behaviour that qualifies them for Council with a great Intrepidity and Resolution that fits them for Action They are all of them  Men of conceal'd Fire that doth not break out with Noise and Heat in the ordinary Circumstances of Life but shews it self sufficiently in all great Enterprises that require it 'Tis true the General upon the  Rhine  hath not had the same Occasions as the others to signalize himself but if we consider the great Vigilance Activity and Courage with the consummate Prudence and the nice sense of Honour which appears in that Prince's Character we have great reason to hope that as he purchased the first Success in the present War by forcing into the Service of the Confederates an Army that was rais'd against them in the very Heart of the Empire he will give one of the finishing Strokes to it and help to conclude the great Work which he so happily begun The sudden Check that he gave to the  French  Army the last Campaign and the good Order he establish'd in that of the  Germans  look like happy Presages of what we may expect from his Conduct I shall not pretend to give any Character of the Generals on the Enemy's side but I think we may say this that in the Eyes of their own Nation they are inferior to several that have formerly commanded the  French  Armies If  then we have greater Numbers than the  French  and at the same time better Generals it must be our own Fault if we will not reap the Fruit of such Advantages  It would be loss of Time to explain any further our Superiority to the Enemy in Numbers of Men and Horse We see plainly that we have the Means in our Hands and that nothing but the Application of them is wanting Let us only consider what use the Enemy would make of the Advantage we have mention'd if it fell on their side and is it not very strange that we shou d not be as active and industrious for our Security as they wou'd certainly be for our Destruction But before we consider more distinctly the Method we ought to take in the Prosecution of the War under this particular View let us reflect a little upon those we have already taken in the Course of it for these six Years past  The Allies after a successful Summer are too apt upon the Strength of it to neglect their Preparations for the ensuing Campaign while the  French  leave no Art nor Stratagem untried to fill up the empty Spaces of their Armies and swell 'em to an equal Bulk with those of the Confederates By this means our Advantage  is lost and the Fate of  Europe  brought to a second Decision It is now become an Observation that we are to expect a very indifferent Year after a very successful one  Blenheim  was follow'd by a Summer that makes no noise in the War  Ramillies Turin  and  Barcelona  were the Parents of our last Campaign So many dreadful Blows allarm'd the Enemy and rais'd their whole Country up in Arms Had we on our side made proportionable Preparations the War by this time had been brought to a happy Issue If after having gain'd the great Victories of  Blenheim  and  Ramillies  we had made the same Efforts as we should have done had we lost them the Power of  France  could not have withstood us  In the beginning of the Winter we usually get what Intelligence we can of the Force which the Enemy intends to employ in the Campaigns of the succeeding Year and immediately cast about for a sufficient number of Troops to face them in the Field of Battle This I must confess would be a good Method if we were engag'd in a Defensive War We might maintain our Ground with an equal Number of Forces but our Business is not only to secure what we are already in Possession of we are to wrest the  whole  Spanish  Monarchy out of the Hands of the Enemy and in order to it to work our Way into the Heart of his Country by dint of Arms We should therefore put forth all our Strength and without having any Eye to his Preparations make the greatest Push that we are able on our own side We are told that the Enemy at present thinks of raising Threescore Thousand Men for the next Summer if we regulate our Levies in that View we do nothing let us perform our utmost as they do and we shall overwhelm 'em with our Multitudes We have it in our Power at least to be four times as strong as the  French  but if Ten Men are in War with Forty and the latter detatch only an equal Number to the Engagement what Benefit do they receive from their Superiority  It seems therefore to be the Business of the Confederates to turn to their Advantage their apparent Odds in Men and Horse and by that means to outnumber the Enemy in all Rencounters and Engagements For the same Reason it must be for the Interest of the Allies to seek all Opportunities of Battle because all Losses on the opposite side are made up with infinitely more Difficulty than on ours  besides that the  French  do their Business by lying still and have no other Concern in the War than to hold fast what they have already got into their Hands  The Miscarriage of the noblest Project that ever was form'd in  Europe  can be ascrib'd to nothing else but our want of Numbers in the several Quarters of the War If our Armies on all sides had begun to busie and insult the Enemy at the same time that the Forces march'd out of  Piemont Toulon  had been at present in the Hands of the Duke of  Savoy  But could that Prince ever have imagin'd that the  French  would have been at liberty to detatch whole Armies against him Or will it appear credible to Posterity that in a War carried on by the joint Force of so many populous and powerful Nations  France  could send so great a part of its Troops to one Seat of the War without suffering in any of the rest Whereas it is well known that if the Duke of  Savoy  had continued before  Toulon  eight Days longer he had been attack'd by an Army of Sixty Thousand Men which was more than double the Number of his own and yet the Enemy was strong enough every where else to prevent the Confederates from making any Impression  upon them However let us fall into the right Measures and we may hope that the Stroke is only deferr'd The Duke of  Savoy  hath secur'd a Passage into  Dauphiny  and if the Allies make such Efforts in all Parts as we may reasonably expect from them that Prince may still make himself Master of the  French  Dominions on the other side of the  Rhone  There is another part of our Conduct which may perhaps deserve to be consider'd As soon as we have agreed with the States General upon any Augmentation of our Forces we immediately negotiate with some or other of the  German  Princes who are in the same Confederacy to furnish out our Quota in Mercenaries This may be doubly prejudicial to the Alliance First as it may have an ill Influence on the Resolutions of those Princes in the Diet of the Empire who may be willing to settle as small a Quota as they can for themselves that they may have more Troops to hire out and in the next place as it may hinder them from contributing the whole Quota which they have settled This actually happen'd in the last Campaign when we are told the  Germans  excus'd themselves for their  want of Troops upon the  Rhine  as having already put most of their Forces into the  British  and  Dutch  Service Such an Excuse indeed is very unjust but it would be better to give them no occasion of making it and on such Occasions to consider what Men are apt to do as well as what they may do with Reason  It might therefore be for our Advantage that all the Foreign Troops in the  British  Pay shou'd be rais'd in Neutral Countries  Switzerland  in particular if timely applied to might be of great use to us not only in respect of the Reinforcements which we might draw from thence but because such a Draught of Forces would lessen the Number of those that might otherwise be employ'd in the  French  Service The Bulk of our Levies shou'd nevertheless be rais'd in our own Country it being impossible for the Neutral States to furnish both the  British  and  Dutch  with a sufficient Number of effective Men besides that the  British  Soldiers will be more at the Disposal of their General and act with greater Vigour under the Conduct of one for whom they have so just a Value and whom they do not consider only as their Leader but as their CountryMan  We may likewise suppose that the Soldiers of a Neutral State who are not animated by any National Interest cannot fight for Pay with the same Ardour and Alacrity as Men that fight for their Prince and Country their Wives and Children  It may likewise be worth while to consider whether the Military Genius of the  English  Nation may not fall by degrees and become inferior to that of our neighbouring States if it hath no occasion to exert it self Minds that are altogether set on Trade and Profit often contract a certain Narrowness of Temper and at length become uncapable of great and generous Resolutions Shou'd the  French  ever make an unexpected Descent upon us we might want Soldiers of our own Growth to rise up in our Defence and might not have time to draw a sufficient Number of Troops to our Relief from the remote Corners of  Germany  It is generally said that if King  Charles  II had made War upon  France  in the beginning of his Reign he might have conquer'd it by the many Veterans which were scatter'd up and down this Kingdom and had been inur'd to Service in the Civil Wars It is to be hop'd we shall never have such another Nursery  of Soldiers but if the present War gives a more Military Turn to all other Nations of  Europe  than to our own it is to be fear'd we may lose in Strength what we gain in Number We may apply the same Consideration nearer home If all our Levies are made in  Scotland  or  Ireland  may not those two Parts of the  British  Monarchy after the disbanding of the present Army be too powerful for the rest in case of a Revolt tho' God be thank'd we are not in any danger of one at present However as these Considerations don't concern the more essential part of our Design it is sufficient have mention'd them  The sparing of our selves in so important a Conjuncture when we have but this single Opportunity left for the preserving every thing that is pretious amongst us is the worst sort of Management that we can possibly fall into The good Husbandry of one Age may intail an endless Expence upon all Posterity We must venture the sacrificing a part of our Lives and Fortunes at present if we will effectually secure both for the future The  British  Kingdom is so well stock'd with People and so much abounds in Horse that we have Power  enough in our own Hands did we make our utmost use of it to humble  France  and in a Campaign or two to put an end to the War  There is not a more disagreeable Thought to the People of  Great Britain  than that of a standing Army But if a Peace be made before the Disunion of  France  and  Spain  there are few perhaps that will not think the maintaining a settled Body of numerous Forces indispensable for the Safety of our Country We have it therefore in our Choice to raise such a strong Reinforcement of Troops as at present may be sufficient in Conjunction with those of the Allies for breaking the Strength of the Enemy or when the Peace is concluded to keep on Foot such an Army as will be necessary for preventing his Attempts upon us  It is to be hop'd that those who wou'd be the most zealous against keeping up a constant Body of Regular Troops after a General Peace will the most distinguish themselves for the promoting an Augmentation of those which are now on Foot and by that means take care that we shall not stand in need of such an Expedient  We are indeed oblig'd by the present Situation of our Affairs to bring more Troops into the Field than we have yet done As the  French  are retir'd within their Lines and have collected all their Strength into a narrow Compass we must have greater Numbers to charge them in their Entrenchments and force them to a Battle We saw the last Campaign that an Army of Fourscore Thousand of the best Troops in  Europe  with the Duke of  Marlborough  at the Head of them cou'd do nothing against an Enemy that were too numerous to be assaulted in their Camps or attack'd in their Strong Holds  There is another Consideration which deserves our utmost Attention We know very well that there is a Prince at the Head of a powerful Army who may give a turn to the War in which we are engag'd if he thinks fit to side with either Party I cannot presume to guess how far our Ministers may be inform'd of his Designs But unless they have very strong Assurances of his falling in with the Grand Alliance or not opposing it they cannot be too circumspect and speedy in taking their Precautions against any contrary Resolution We shall be unpardonable if  after such an Expence of Blood and Treasure we leave it in the power of any single Prince to command a Peace and make us accept what Conditions he thinks fit It is certain according to the Posture of our Affairs in the last Campaign this Prince could have turn'd the Ballance on either side but it is to be hop'd the Liberties of  Europe  will not depend any more on the Determination of one Man's Will I don't speak this because I think there is any Appearance of that Prince's uniting himself to  France  On the contrary as he hath an extraordinary Zeal for the Reform'd Religion and great Sentiments of Honour I think it is not improbable we shou'd draw him over to the Confederacy if we press him to it by proper Motives His Love for Religion and his Sense of Glory will both have their effect on a Prince who hath already distinguish'd himself by being a Patron of Protestants and Guarantee of the  Westphalian  Treaty And if his Interest hath any part in his Actions the Allies may make him greater Offers than the  French  King can do in the present Conjuncture There are large Extents of Dominion in the forfeited Principalities of the Empire doubtful Successions to which  the King of  Sweden  seems to have very just Pretensions and at the same time a great Title not yet dispos'd of and a Seat of War on the  Moselle  where none of our Generals have signaliz'd themselves It would be Presumption to be particular in any Proposals on such an Occasion it is enough to have shewn in general that there are fair Opportunies of which the Wisdom of the Confederates may make use  Common Sense will direct us when we see so warlike a Prince at the Head of so great an Army hovering on the Borders of our Confederates either to obtain his Friendship or secure ourselves against the Force of his Arms We are sure whatever numbers of Troops we raise we shall have no Hands but what will turn to account Nay we are certain that extraordinary Funds and Augmentations for one or two Campaigns may spare us the Expence of many Years and put an end to Taxes and Levies for a whole Age whereas a long parcimonious War will drain us of more Men and Money and in the end may prove ineffectual  There is still a great Popular Objection which will be made to every thing that can  be urg'd on this Subject And indeed 'tis such a one as falls so much in with the Prejudices and little Passions of the Multitude that when it is turn'd and set off to advantage by illdesigning Men it throws a Damp on the publick Spirit of the Nation and gives a check to all generous Resolutions for its Honour and Safety In short we are to be told that  England  contributes much more than any other of the Allies and that therefore it is not reasonable she shou'd make any Addition to her present Efforts If this were true in Fact I don't see any tolerable colour for such a Conclusion Supposing among a Multitude embarqu'd in the same Vessel there are several that in the fury of a Tempest will rather perish than work for their Preservation wou'd it not be Madness in the rest to stand idle and rather chuse to sink together than do more than comes to their share Since we are engag'd in a Work so absolutely necessary for our Welfare the Remisness of our Allies should be an Argument for us to redouble our Endeavours rather than slacken them If we must govern our selves by Example let us rather imitate the Vigilance and Activity of the Common Enemy than  the Supineness and Negligence of our Friends  We have indeed a much greater share in the War than any other part of the Confederacy The  French  King makes at us directly keeps a King by him to set over us and hath very lately augmented the Salary of his Court to let us see how much he hath that Design at heart Few of the Nations in War with him shou'd they ever fall into his hands wou'd lose their Religion or Form of Government or interfere at present with him in matters of Commerce The  Dutch  who are likely to be the greatest Losers after the  Britains  have but little Trade to the  Levant  in comparison with ours have no considerable Plantations or Commerce in the  WestIndies  or any WoollenManufactures for  Spain  not to mention the strong Barrier they have already purchas'd between  France  and their own Country  But after all every Nation in the Confederacy makes the same Complaint and fancys itself the greatest Sufferer by the War Indeed in so common a Pressure let the Weight be never so equally distributed every one will be most sensible of that part which lies on his own Shoulders We furnish  without dispute more than any other Branch of the Alliance but the question is whether others do not exert themselves in proportion according to their respective Strength The Emperor the King of  Prussia  the Elector of  Hannover  as well as the States of  Holland  and the Duke of  Savoy  seem at least to come up to us The greatest Powers in  Germany  are borrowing Mony where they can get it in order to maintain their stated Quota's and go thorough their part of the Expence and f any of the Circles have been negligent they have paid for it much more in their late Contributions than what wou'd have furnish'd out their Share in the common Charges of the War  There are others who will object the Poverty of the Nation and the Difficulties it wou'd find in furnishing greater Supplies to the War than it doth at present To this we might answer that if the Nation were really as poor as this Objection makes it it shou'd be an Argument for enforcing rather than diminishing our present Efforts against  France  The sinking our Taxes for a few Years wou'd be only a temporary Relief and in a little time occasion far greater Impositions  than those which are now laid upon us Whereas the seasonable Expence of part of our Riches will not only preserve the rest but by the right use of them procure vast Additions to our present Stock It may be necessary for a Person languishing under an ill Habit of Body to lose several Ounces of Blood notwithstanding it will weaken him for a time in order to put a new Ferment into the remaining Mass and draw into it fresh Supplies  But we can by no means make this Concession to those who so industriously publish the Nation's Poverty Our Country is not only rich but abounds in Wealth much more than any other of the same Extent in  EuropeFrance  notwithstanding the Goodness of its Climate the Fertility of its Soil the Multitude of its Inhabitants its convenient Harbours both for the  Ocean  and  Mediterranean  and its present Correspondence with the  WestIndies  is not to compare with  Great Britain  in this particular I shall transcribe word for word the Passage of a late celebrated  French  Author which will lay this Matter in its full light and leave the Reader to make the counterpart of the Parallel between the two Nations  "According to all the Inquiries that I have been able to make during several Years in which I have apply'd my self to this sort of Remarks I have observ'd that about a Tenth part of the People of this Kingdom are reduc'd to Beggary and are actual Beggars That among the Nine other parts Five are not in a condition to give Alms or Relief to those aforemention'd being very near reduc'd themselves to the same miserable Condition Of the Four other remaining Parts Three are very uneasy in their Circumstances and embarass'd with Debts and LawSuits In the Tenth part I reckon the Soldiers Lawyers Ecclesiasticks Merchants and substantial Citizens which cannot make up more than a Hundred Thousand Families And I believe I should not be mistaken if I shou'd say that there are not above Ten Thousand of these Families who are very much at their ease and if out of these Ten Thousand we shou'd take the Men that are employ'd in Publick Business with their Dependents and Adherents as also those whom the King supports by his Bounty with a few Merchants  the number of those who remain will be surprisingly little"  Dixme Royale  What a dreadful Account is this of Nineteen Millions of People for so many the Author reckons in that Kingdom How can we see such a Multitude of Souls cast under so many Subdivisions of Misery without reflecting on the Absurdity of a Form of Government that sacrifices the Ease and Happiness of so many reasonable Beings to the Glory of one of their FellowCreatures But this is not our Affair at present  If we run over the other Nations of  Europe  that have any part in the present War we shall only pass through so many different Scenes of Poverty  Spain Portugal  and  Savoy  are reduc'd to great Extremities  Germany  is exhausted to the last degree in many parts of it and in others plundered of all she had left  Holland  indeed flourishes above the rest in Wealth and Plenty But if we consider the infinite Industry and Penuriousness of that People the Coarseness of their Food and Raiment their little Indulgences of Pleasure and Excess it is no wonder that notwithstanding they furnish as great Taxes as their Neighbours they make a better figure  under them In a Commonwealth there are not so many overgrown Estates as in Monarchies the Wealth of the Country is so equally distributed that most of the Community are at their Ease though few are plac'd in extraordinary Points of Splendour and Magnificence But notwithstanding these Circumcumstances may very much contribute to the seeming Prosperity of the  Ʋnited Provinces  we know they are indebted many Millions more than their whole Republick is worth and if we consider the variety of Taxes and Impositions they groan under at a time when their private Dissensions run high and some of the wealthiest parts of the Government refuse to bear their share in the publick Expence we shall not think the Condition of that People so much to be envied as some amongst us would willingly represent it  Nor is  Great Britain  only rich as she stands in comparison with other States but is really so in her own intrinsick Wealth She had never more Ships at Sea greater quantities of Merchandise in her Warehouses larger Receipts of Customes or more numerous Commodities rising out of her Manufactures than she has at present In short she sits in the  midst of a mighty Affluence of all the Necessaries and Conveniencies of Life If our Silver and Gold diminishes our publick Credit continues unimpair'd and if we are in want of Bullion it lies in our own power to supply our selves The old  Roman  General when he heard his Army complain of Thirst shew'd 'em the Springs and Rivers that lay behind the Enemy's Camp It is our own case The Rout of a  Spanish  Army would make us Masters of the  Indies  If Prince  Eugene  takes upon him the Command of the Confederate Forces in  Catalonia  and meets with that Support from the Alliance which they are capable of giving him we have a fair Prospect of reducing  Spain  to the entire Obedience of the House of  Austria  The  Silesian  Fund to the immortal Reputation of those generous Patriots who were concern'd in it enabled that Prince to make a Conquest of  Italy  at a time when our Affairs were more desperate there than they are at present in the Kingdom of  Spain  When our Parliament has done their utmost another publick spirited Project of the same nature which the Common Enemy cou'd not foresee nor prepare against might in all  probability set King  Charles  upon the Throne for which he hath so long contended One pitcht Battle wou'd determine the Fate of the  Spanish  Continent  Let us therefore exert the united Strength of our whole Island and by that means put a new Life and Spirit into the Confederates who have their Eyes fixt upon us and will abate or increase their Preparations according to the Example that is set them We see the Necessity of an Augmentation if we intend to bring the Enemy to Reason or rescue our Country from the Miseries that may befal it and we find our selves in a condition of making such an Augmentation as by the Blessing of God cannot but prove effectual If we carry it on vigorously we shall gain for our selves and our Posterity a long a glorious and a lasting Peace but if we neglect so fair an Opportunity we may be willing to employ all our Hands and all our Treasures when it will be too late and shall be tormented with one of the most melancholy Reflexions of an afflicted Heart That it was once in our Power to have made our selves and our Children happy  FINIS
