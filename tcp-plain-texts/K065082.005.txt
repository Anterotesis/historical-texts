HISTORY OF THE DECLINE AND FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE  CHAP XXVII  Death of GratianRuin of ArianismSt AmbroseFirst civil War against MaximusCharacter Administration and Pennance of TheodosiusDeath of Valentinian  II  Second civil War against EugeniusDeath of Theodosius  THE fame of Gratian before he had accomplished the twentieth year of his age was equal to that of the most celebrated  Character and conduct of the emperor Gratian A D  princes His gentle and amiable disposition endeared him to his private friends the graceful affability of his manners engaged the affection of the people the men of letters who enjoyed the liberality acknowledged the taste and eloquence of their sovereign his valour and dexterity in arms were equally applauded by the  soldiers and the clergy considered the humble piety of Gratian as the first and most useful of his virtues The victory of Colmar had delivered the West from a formidable invasion and the grateful provinces of the East ascribed the merits of Theodosius to the author of  his  greatness and of the public safety Gratian survived those memorable events only four or five years but he survived his reputation and before he fell a victim to rebellion he had lost in a great measure the respect and confidence of the Roman world  The remarkable alteration of his character or  His defects  conduct may not be imputed to the arts of flattery which had besieged the son of Valentinian from his infancy nor to the headstrong passions which that gentle youth appears to have escaped A more attentive view of the life of Gratian may perhaps suggest the true cause of the disappointment of the public hopes His apparent virtues instead of being the hardy productions of experience and adversity were the premature and artificial fruits of a royal education The anxious tenderness of his father was continually employed to bestow on him those advantages which he might perhaps esteem the more highly as he himself had been deprived of them and the most skilful masters of every science and of every art had laboured to form the mind and body of the young prince  Valentinian was less attentive to the religion of his son since he entrusted the education of Gratian to Ausonius a professed Pagan Mem de l'Academie des Inscriptions tom xv p The poetical fame of Ausonius condemns the taste of his age  The knowledge which they painfully  communicated was displayed with ostentation and celebrated with lavish praise His soft and tractable disposition received the fair impression of their judicious precepts and the absence of passion might easily be mistaken for the strength of reason His preceptors gradually rose to the rank and consequence of ministers of state  Ausonius was successively promoted to the Praetorian praefecture of Italy A D and of Gaul A D and was at length invested with the consulship A D He expressed his gratitude in a servile and insipid piece of flattery Actio Gratiarum p which has survived more worthy productions  and as they wisely dissembled their secret authority he seemed to act with firmness with propriety and with judgment on the most important occasions of his life and reign But the influence of this elaborate instruction did not penetrate beyond the surface and the skilful preceptors who so accurately guided the steps of their royal pupil could not infuse into his feeble and indolent character the vigorous and independent principle of action which renders the laborious pursuit of glory essentially necessary to the happiness and almost to the existence of the hero As soon as time and accident had removed those faithful counsellors from the throne the emperor of the West insensibly descended to the level of his natural genius abandoned the reins of government to the ambitious hands which were stretched forwards to grasp them and amused his leisure with the most frivolous gratifications A public sale of favour and injustice was instituted both  in the court and in the provinces by the worthless delegates of his power whose merit it was made  sacrilege  to question  Disputare de principali judicio non oportet Sacrilegii enim instar est dubitare an is dignus sit quem elegerit imperator Codex Justinian l ix tit xxix leg This convenient law was revived and promulgated after the death of Gratian by the feeble court of Milan  The conscience of the credulous prince was directed by saints and bishops  Ambrose composed for his instruction a theological treatise on the faith of the Trinity and Tillemont Hist des Empereurs tom v p ascribes to the archbishop the merit of Gratian's intolerant laws  who procured an Imperial edict to punish as a capital offence the violation the neglect or even the ignorance of the divine law  Qui divinae legis sanctitatem nesciendo omittunt aut negligendo violant et offendunt sacrilegium committunt Codex Justinian l ix tit xxix leg Theodosius indeed may claim his share in the merit of this comprehensive law  Among the various arts which had exercised the youth of Gratian he had applied himself with singular inclination and success to manage the horse to draw the bow and to dart the javelin and these qualifications which might be useful to a soldier were prostituted to the viler purposes of hunting Large parks were inclosed for the Imperial pleasures and plentifully stocked with every species of wild beasts and Gratian neglected the duties and even the dignity of his rank to consume whole days in the vain display of his dexterity and boldness in the chace The pride and wish of the Roman emperor to excel in an art in which he might be surpassed by the meanest of his slaves reminded the numerous spectators of the examples of Nero and  Commodus but the chaste and temperate Gratian was a stranger to their monstrous vices and his hands were stained only with the blood of animals  Ammianus xxxi and the younger Victor acknowledge the virtues of Gratian and accuse or rather lament his degenerate taste  The odious parallel of Commodus is saved by "licet incruentus" and perhaps Philostorgius l x c and Godefroy p had guarded with some similar reserve the comparison of Nero    The behaviour of Gratian which degraded his  Discontent of the Roman troops A D  character in the eyes of mankind could not have disturbed the security of his reign if the army had not been provoked to resent their peculiar injuries As long as the young emperor was guided by the instructions of his masters he professed himself the friend and pupil of the soldiers many of his hours were spent in the familiar conversation of the camp and the health the comforts the rewards the honours of his faithful troops appeared to be the object of his attentive concern But after Gratian more freely indulged his prevailing taste for hunting and shooting he naturally connected himself with the most dexterous ministers of his favourite amusement A body of the Alani was received into the military and domestic service of the palace and the admirable skill which they were accustomed to display in the unbounded plains of Scythia was exercised on a more narrow theatre in the parks and inclosures of Gaul Gratian admired the talents and customs of these favourite guards to whom alone he entrusted the defence of his person  and as if he meant to insult the public opinion he frequently shewed himself to the soldiers and people with the dress and arms the long bow the sounding quiver and the fur garments of a Scythian warrior The unworthy spectacle of a Roman prince who had renounced the dress and manners of his country filled the minds of the legions with grief and indignation  Zosimus l iv p and the younger Victor ascribe the revolution to the favour of the Alani and the discontent of the Roman troops Dum exercitum negligeret et paucos ex Alanis quos ingenti auro ad se transtulerat anteferret veteri ac Romano militi  Even the Germans so strong and formidable in the armies of the empire affected to disdain the strange and horrid appearance of the savages of the North who in the space of a few years had wandered from the banks of the Volga to those of the Seine A loud and licentious murmur was echoed through the camps and garrisons of the West and as the mild indolence of Gratian neglected to extinguish the first symptoms of discontent the want of love and respect was not supplied by the influence of fear But the subversion of an established government is always a work of some real and of much apparent difficulty and the throne of Gratian was protected by the sanctions of custom law religion and the nice balance of the civil and military powers which had been established by the policy of Constantine It is not very important to enquire from what causes the revolt of Britain was produced Accident is commonly the parent of disorder the seeds of rebellion happened to fall on a soil which was supposed to be more fruitful than any other in tyrants and  usurpers  Britannia fertilis provincia tyrannorum is a memorable expression used by Jerom in the Pelagian controversy and variously tortured in the disputes of our national antiquaries The revolutions of the last age appeared to justify the image of the sublime Bossuet "cette isle plus orageuse que les mers qui l'environment"  the legions of that sequestered island had been long famous for a spirit of presumption and arrogance  Zosimus says of the British soldiers    and the name of Maximus was  Revolt of Maximus in Britain  proclaimed by the tumultuary but unanimous voice both of the soldiers and of the provincials The emperor or the rebel for his title was not yet ascertained by fortune was a native of Spain the countryman the fellowsoldier and the rival of Theodosius whose elevation he had not seen without some emotions of envy and resentment the events of his life had long since fixed him in Britain and I should not be unwilling to find some evidence for the marriage which he is said to have contracted with the daughter of a wealthy lord of Caernarvonshire  Helena the daughter of Eudda Her chapel may still be seen at Caersegont now Caernarvon Carte's Hist of England vol i p from Rowland's Mona Antiqua The prudent reader may not perhaps be satisfied with such Welch evidence  But this provincial rank might justly be considered as a state of exile and obscurity and if Maximus had obtained any civil or military office he was not invested with the authority either of governor or general  Cambden vol i introduct p ci appoints him governor of Britain and the father of our antiquities is followed as usual by his blind progeny Pacatus and Zosimus had taken some pains to prevent this error or fable and I shall protect myself by their decisive testimonies Regali habitû  exulem  suum illi exules orbis induerunt in Panegyr Vet xii and the Greek historian still less equivocally  Maximus  l iv p    His abilities and even his integrity are acknowledged by the partial writers of the age and the merit must indeed have been conspicuous that could extort such a confession in favour of the vanquished enemy of Theodosius The discontent of Maximus might incline him to censure the conduct of his sovereign and to encourage perhaps without any views of ambition the murmurs of the troops But in the midst of the tumult he artfully or modestly refused to ascend the throne and some credit appears to have been given to his own positive declaration that he was compelled to accept the dangerous present of the Imperial purple  Sulpicius Severus Dialog ii Orosius l vii c p They both acknowledge Sulpicius had been his subject his innocence and merit It is singular enough that Maximus should be less favourably treated by Zosimus the partial adversary of his rival    But there was danger likewise in refusing the  Flight and death of Gratian  empire and from the moment that Maximus had violated his allegiance to his lawful sovereign he could not hope to reign or even to live if he confined his moderate ambition within the narrow limits of Britain He boldly and wisely resolved to prevent the designs of Gratian the youth of the island crowded to his standard and he invaded Gaul with a fleet and army which were long afterwards remembered as the emigration of a considerable part of the British nation  Archbishop Usher Antiquitat Britan Eccles p has diligently collected the legends of the island and the continent The whole emigration consisted of soldiers and plebeians who settled in Bretagne Their destined brides St Ursula with noble and plebeian virgins mistook their way landed at Cologne and were all most cruelly murdered by the Huns But the plebeian sisters have been defrauded of their equal honours and what is still harder John Trithemius presumes to mention the  children  of these British  virgins  The emperor in his peaceful residence  of Paris was alarmed by their hostile approach and the darts which he idly wasted on lions and bears might have been employed more honourably against the rebels But his feeble efforts announced his degenerate spirit and desperate situation and deprived him of the resources which he still might have found in the support of his subjects and allies The armies of Gaul instead of opposing the march of Maximus received him with joyful and loyal acclamations and the shame of the desertion was transferred from the people to the prince The troops whose station more immediately attached them to the service of the palace abandoned the standard of Gratian the first time that it was displayed in the neighbourhood of Paris The emperor of the West fled towards Lyons with a train of only three hundred horse and in the cities along the road where he hoped to find a refuge or at least a passage he was taught by cruel experience that every gate is shut against the unfortunate Yet he might still have reached in safety the dominions of his brother and soon have returned with the forces of Italy and the East if he had not suffered himself to be fatally deceived by the perfidious governor of the Lyonnese province Gratian was amused by protestations of doubtful fidelity and the hopes of a  support which could not be effectual till the arrival of Andragathius the general of the cavalry of Maximus put an end to his suspense That resolute officer executed without remorse the orders or the intentions of the usurper Gratian as he rose from supper was delivered into the hands of the assassin and his body was denied to the pious and pressing intreaties of his brother  A D Aug  Valentinian  Zosimus l iv p has transported the death of Gratian from Lugdunum in Gaul Lyons to Singidunum in Moesia Some hints may be extracted from the Chronicles some lies may be detected in Sozomen l vii c and Socrates l v c Ambrose is our most authentic evidence tom i Enarrat in Psalm lxi p tom ii epist xxiv p c and de Obitû Valentinian Consolat No p  The death of the emperor was followed by that of his powerful general Mellobaudes the king of the Franks who maintained to the last moment of his life the ambiguous reputation which is the just recompence of obscure and subtle policy  Pacatus xii celebrates his sidelity while his treachery is marked in Prosper's Chronicle as the cause of the ruin of Gratian Ambrose who has occasion to exculpate himself only condemns the death of Vallio a faithful servant of Gratian tom ii epist xxiv p edit Benedict  These executions might be necessary to the public safety but the successful usurper whose power was acknowledged by all the provinces of the West had the merit and the satisfaction of boasting that except those who had perished by the chance of war his triumph was not stained by the blood of the Romans  He protested nullum ex adversariis nisi in acie occubuisse Sulp Severus in Vit B Martin c The orator of Theodosius bestows reluctant and therefore weighty praise on his clemency Si cui ille pro ceteris sceleribus suis  minus crudelis  fuisse videtur Panegyr Vet xii    The events of this revolution had passed in such rapid succession that it would have been impossible for Theodosius to march to the relief  Treaty of peace between Maximus and Theodosius A D  of his benefactor before he received the intelligence of his defeat and death During the season of sincere grief or ostentatious mourning the Eastern emperor was interrupted by the arrival of the principal chamberlain of Maximus and the choice of a venerable old man for an office which was usually exercised by eunuchs announced to the court of Constantinople the gravity and temperance of the British usurper The ambassador condescended to justify or excuse the conduct of his master and to protest in specious language that the murder of Gratian had been perpetrated without his knowledge or consent by the precipitate zeal of the soldiers But he proceeded in a firm and equal tone to offer Theodosius the alternative of peace or war The speech of the ambassador concluded with a spirited declaration that although Maximus as a Roman and as the father of his people would chuse rather to employ his forces in the common defence of the republic he was armed and prepared if his friendship should be rejected to dispute in a field of battle the empire of the world An immediate and peremptory answer was required but it was extremely difficult for Theodosius to satisfy on this important occasion either the feelings of his own mind or the expectations of the public The imperious voice of honour and gratitude called aloud for revenge From the liberality of Gratian  he had received the Imperial diadem his patience would encourage the odious suspicion that he was more deeply sensible of former injuries than of recent obligations and if he accepted the friendship he must seem to share the guilt of the assassin Even the principles of justice and the interest of society would receive a fatal blow from the impunity of Maximus and the example of successful usurpation would tend to dissolve the artificial fabric of government and once more to replunge the empire in the crimes and calamities of the preceding age But as the sentiments of gratitude and honour should invariably regulate the conduct of an individual they may be overbalanced in the mind of a sovereign by the sense of superior duties and the maxims both of justice and humanity must permit the escape of an atrocious criminal if an innocent people would be involved in the consequences of his punishment The assassin of Gratian had usurped but he actually possessed the most warlike provinces of the empire the East was exhausted by the misfortunes and even by the success of the Gothic war and it was seriously to be apprehended that after the vital strength of the republic had been wasted in a doubtful and destructive contest the feeble conqueror would remain an easy prey to the Barbarians of the North These weighty considerations engaged Theodosius to dissemble his resentment and to accept the alliance of the tyrant But he stipulated that Maximus should content himself with the possession of the countries beyond  the Alps The brother of Gratian was confirmed and secured in the sovereignty of Italy Africa and the Western Illyricum and some honourable conditions were inserted in the treaty to protect the memory and the laws of the deceased emperor  Ambrose mentions the laws of Gratian quas non abrogavit hostis tom ii epist xvii p  According to the custom of the age the images of the three Imperial colleagues were exhibited to the veneration of the people nor should it be lightly supposed that in the moment of a solemn reconciliation Theodosius secretly cherished the intention of perfidy and revenge  Zosimus l iv p We may disclaim his odious suspicions but we cannot reject the treaty of peace which the friends of Theodosius have absolutely forgotten or slightly mentioned    The contempt of Gratian for the Roman soldiers  Baptism and orthodox edicts of Theodosius A D Feb  had exposed him to the fatal effects of their resentment His profound veneration for the Christian clergy was rewarded by the applause and gratitude of a powerful order which has claimed in every age the privilege of dispensing honours both on earth and in heaven  Their oracle the archbishop of Milan assigns to his pupil Gratian an high and respectable place in heaven tom ii de Obit Val Consol p  The orthodox bishops bewailed his death and their own irreparable loss but they were soon comforted by the discovery that Gratian had committed the sceptre of the East to the hands of a prince whose humble faith and fervent zeal were supported by the spirit and abilities of a more vigorous character Among the benefactors  of the church the fame of Constantine has been rivalled by the glory of Theodosius If Constantine had the advantage of erecting the standard of the cross the emulation of his successor assumed the merit of subduing the Arian heresy and of abolishing the worship of idols in the Roman world Theodosius was the first of the emperors baptised in the true faith of the Trinity Although he was born of a Christian family the maxims or at least the practice of the age encouraged him to delay the ceremony of his initiation till he was admonished of the danger of delay by the serious illness which threatened his life towards the end of the first year of his reign Before he again took the field against the Goths he received the sacrament of baptism  For the baptism of Theodosius see Sozomen l vii c Socrates l v c and Tillemont Hist des Empereurs tom v p  from Acholius the orthodox bishop of Thessalonica  Ascolius or Acholius was honoured by the friendship and the praises of Ambrose who styles him murus fidei atque sanctitatis tom ii epist xv p and afterwards celebrates his speed and diligence in running to Constantinople Italy c epist xvi p a virtue which does not appertain either to a  wall  or a  bishop  and as the emperor ascended from the holy font still glowing with the warm feelings of regeneration he dictated a solemn edict which proclaimed his own faith and prescribed the religion of his subjects  "It is our pleasure such is the Imperial style that all the nations which are governed by our clemency and moderation should stedfastly adhere to the religion which was taught by St  Peter to the Romans which faithful tradition has preserved and which is now professed by the pontiff Damasus and by Peter bishop of Alexandria a man of apostolic holiness According to the discipline of the apostles and the doctrine of the gospel let us believe the sole deity of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost under an equal majesty and a pious Trinity We authorise the followers of this doctrine to assume the title of Catholic Christians and as we judge that all others are extravagant madmen we brand them with the infamous name of Heretics and declare that their conventicles shall no longer usurp the respectable appellation of churches Besides the condemnation of Divine justice they must expect to suffer the severe penalties which our authority guided by heavenly wisdom shall think proper to inflict upon them  Codex Theodos l xvi tit i leg with Godefroy's Commentary tom vi p Such an edict deserved the warmest praises of Baronius auream sanctionem edictum pium et salutareSic itur ad astra  "  The faith of a soldier is commonly the fruit of instruction rather than of enquiry but as the emperor always fixed his eyes on the visible landmarks of orthodoxy which he had so prudently constituted his religious opinions were never affected by the specious texts the subtle arguments and the ambiguous creeds of the Arian doctors Once indeed he expressed a faint inclination to converse with the eloquent and learned Eunomius who lived in retirement at a small distance from Constantinople  But the dangerous interview was prevented by the prayers of the Empress Flaccilla who trembled for the salvation of her husband and the mind of Theodosius was confirmed by a theological argument adapted to the rudest capacity He had lately bestowed on his eldest son Arcadius the name and honours of Augustus and the two princes were seated on a stately throne to receive the homage of their subjects A bishop Amphilochius of Iconium approached the throne and after saluting with due reverence the person of his sovereign he accosted the royal youth with the same familiar tenderness which he might have used towards a plebeian child Provoked by this insolent behaviour the monarch gave orders that the rustic priest should be instantly driven from his presence But while the guards were forcing him to the door the dexterous polemic had time to execute his design by exclaiming with a loud voice  "Such is the treatment O Emperor which the King of Heaven has prepared for those impious men who affect to worship the Father but refuse to acknowledge the equal majesty of his divine Son"  Theodosius immediately embraced the bishop of Iconium and never forgot the important lesson which he had received from this dramatic parable  Sozomen l vii c Theodoret l v c Tillemont is displeased Mem Eccles tom vi p with the terms of "rustic bishop" "obscure city" Yet I must take leave to think that both Amphilochius and Iconium were objects of inconsiderable magnitude in the Roman empire    Constantinople was the principal seat and fortress of Arianism and in a long interval of forty years  Sozomen l vii c Socrates l v c Marcellin in Chron The account of forty years must be dated from the election or intrusion of Eusebius who wisely exchanged the bishopric of Nicomedia for the throne of Constantinople  the faith of the princes and prelates who  Arianism of Constantinople A D  reigned in the capital of the East was rejected in the purer schools of Rome and Alexandria The archiepiscopal throne of Macedonius which had been polluted with so much Christian blood was successively filled by Eudoxus and Damophilus Their diocese enjoyed a free importation of vice and error from every province of the empire the eager pursuit of religious controversy afforded a new occupation to the busy idleness of the metropolis and we may credit the assertion of an intelligent observer who describes with some pleasantry the effects of their loquacious zeal  "This city says he is full of mechanics and slaves who are all of them profound theologians and preach in the shops and in the streets If you desire a man to change a piece of silver he informs you wherein the Son differs from the Father if you ask the price of a loaf you are told by way of reply that the Son is inferior to the Father and if you enquire whether the bath is ready the answer is that the Son was made out of nothing  See Jortin's Remarks on Ecclesiastical History vol iv p The thirtythird Oration of Gregory Nazianzen affords indeed some similar ideas even some still more ridiculous but I have not yet found the  words  of this remarkable passage which I allege on the faith of a correct and liberal scholar  "  The heretics of various denominations subsisted in peace under the protection of the Arians of Constantinople who endeavoured to secure the attachment of those obscure sectaries while they abused with unrelenting severity the victory which they had obtained over the followers of the council of Nice During the partial reigns of Constantius and Valens the feeble remnant of the Homoousians was deprived of the public and private exercise of their religion and it has been observed in pathetic language that the scattered flock was left without a shepherd to wander on the mountains or to be devoured by rapacious wolves  See the thirtysecond Oration of Gregory Nazianzen and the account of his own life which he has composed in iambics Yet every physician is prone to exaggerate the inveterate nature of the disease which he has cured  But as their zeal instead of being subdued derived strength and vigour from oppression they seized the first moments of imperfect freedom which they acquired by the death of Valens to form themselves into a regular congregation under the conduct of an episcopal pastor Two natives of Cappadocia Basil and Gregory Nazianzen  I confess myself deeply indebted to the  two  lives of Gregory Nazianzen composed with very different views by Tillemont Mem Eccles tom ix p and Le Clerc Bibliotheque Universelle tom xviii p  were distinguished above all their  Gregory Nazianzen  contemporaries  Unless Gregory Nazianzen mistook thirty years in his own age he was born as well as his friend Basil about the year The preposterous chronology of Suidas has been graciously received because it removes the scandal of Gregory's father a saint likewise begetting children after he became a bishop Tillemont Mem Eccles tom ix p  by the rare union of profane  eloquence and of orthodox piety These orators who might sometimes be compared by themselves and by the public to the most celebrated of the ancient Greeks were united by the ties of the strictest friendship They had cultivated with equal ardour the same liberal studies in the the schools of Athens they had retired with equal devotion to the same solitude in the deserts of Pontus and every spark of emulation or envy appeared to be totally extinguished in the holy and ingenuous breasts of Gregory and Basil But the exaltation of Basil from a private life to the archiepiscopal throne of Caesarea discovered to the world and perhaps to himself the pride of his character and the first favour which he condescended to

speedily accomplished and the emperor as soon as he had finished the operations of the campaign made his public entry into the capital at the head  of a victorious army The next day after his arrival he summoned Damophilus to his prefence and offered that Arian prelate the hard alternative of subscribing the Nicene creed or of instantly resigning to the orthodox believers the use and possession of the episcopal palace the cathedral of St Sophia and all the churches of Constantinople The zeal of Damophilus which in a Catholic saint would have been justly applauded embraced without hesitation a life of poverty and exile  Socrates l v c and Sozomen l vii c relate the evangelical words and actions of Damophilus without a word of approbation He considered says Socrates that it is difficult to  resist  the powerful but it was easy and would have been profitable to  submit  and his removal was immediately followed by the purification of the Imperial City The Arians might complain with some appearance of justice that an inconsiderable congregation of sectaries should usurp the hundred churches which they were insufficient to fill whilst the far greater part of the people was cruelly excluded from every place of religious worship Theodosius was still inexorable but as the angels who protected the Catholic cause were only visible to the eyes of faith he prudently reinforced those heavenly legions with the more effectual aid of temporal and carnal weapons and the church of St Sophia was occupied by a large body of the Imperial guards If the mind of Gregory was susceptible of pride he must have felt a very lively satisfaction when the emperor conducted him through the streets in solemn triumph and with his own hand respectfully  placed him on the archiepiscopal throne of Constantinople But the saint who had not subdued the imperfections of human virtue was deeply affected by the mortifying consideration that his entrance into the fold was that of a wolf rather than of a shepherd that the glittering arms which surrounded his person were necessary for his safety and that he alone was the object of the imprecations of a great party whom as men and citizens it was impossible for him to despise He beheld the innumerable multitude of either sex and of every age who crowded the streets the windows and the roofs of the houses he heard the tumultuous voice of rage

the sun broke forth when the procession entered the church  About six weeks afterwards Theodosius declared his resolution of expelling from all the churches of his dominions the bishops and their

expulsion of Damophilus The Eunomian historian has been carefully strained through an orthodox sieve  would perhaps contain the lamentable story of the persecution which afflicted the church under the reign of the impious Theodosius and the sufferings of  their  holy confessors might claim the pity of the disinterested reader Yet there is reason to imagine that the violence of zeal and revenge was in some measure eluded by the want of resistance and that in their adversity the Arians displayed much less firmness than had been exerted by the orthodox party under the reigns of Constantius and Valens The moral character and conduct of the hostile sects appear to have been governed by the same common principles of nature and religion but a very material circumstance may be discovered which tended to distinguish the degrees of their theological faith Both parties in the schools as well as in the temples acknowledged and worshipped the divine majesty of Christ and as we are always prone to impute our own sentiments and passions to the Deity it would be deemed more prudent and respectful to exaggerate than to circumscribe the adorable perfections of the Son of God The disciple of Athanasius exulted in the proud confidence that he had entitled himself to the divine  favour while the follower of Arius must have been tormented by the secret apprehension that he was guilty perhaps of an unpardonable offence by the scanty praise and parsimonious honours which he bestowed on the Judge of the World The opinions of Arianism might satisfy a cold and speculative mind but the doctrine of the Nicene Creed most powerfully recommended by the merits of faith and devotion was much better adapted to become popular and successful in a believing age  The hope that truth and wisdom would be  The council of Constantinople A D May  found in the assemblies of the orthodox clergy induced the emperor to convene at Constantinople a synod of one hundred and fifty bishops who proceeded without much difficulty or delay to complete the theological system which had been established in the council of Nice The vehement disputes of the fourth century had been chiefly employed on the nature of the Son of God and the various opinions which were embraced concerning the  Second  were extended and transferred by a natural analogy to the  Third  person of the Trinity  Le Clerc has given a curious extract Bibliothéque Universelle tom xviii p of the theological sermons which Gregory Nazianzen pronounced at Constantinople against the Arians Eunomians Macedonians c He tells the Macedonians who deified the Father and the Son without the Holy Ghost that they might as well be stiled  Tritheists  as  Ditheists  Gregory himself was almost a Tritheist and his monarchy of heaven resembles a wellregulated aristocracy  Yet it was found or it was thought necessary by the victorious adversaries of Arianism to explain the ambiguous language  of some respectable doctors to confirm the faith of the Catholics and to condemn an unpopular and inconsistent sect of Macedonians who freely admitted that the Son was consubstantial to the Father while they were fearful of seeming to acknowledge the existence of  Three  Gods A final and unanimous sentence was pronounced to ratify the equal Deity of the Holy Ghost the mysterious doctrine has been received by all the nations and all the churches of the Christian world and their grateful reverence has assigned to the bishops of Theodosius the second rank among the general councils  The first general council of Constantinople now triumphs in the Vatican but the popes had long hesitated and their hesitation perplexes and almost staggers the humble Tillemont Mem Eccles tom ix p  Their knowledge of religious truth may have been preserved by tradition or it may have been communicated by inspiration but the sober evidence of history will not allow much weight to the personal authority of the Fathers of Constantinople In an age when the ecclesiastics had scandalously degenerated from the model of apostolical purity the most worthless and corrupt were always the most eager to frequent and disturb the episcopal assemblies The conflict and fermentation of so many opposite interests and tempers inflamed the passions of the bishops and their ruling passions were the love of gold and the love of dispute Many of the same prelates who now applauded the orthodox piety of Theodosius had repeatedly changed with prudent flexibility their creeds  and opinions and in the various revolutions of the church and state the religion of their sovereign was the rule of their obsequious faith When the emperor suspended his prevailing influence the turbulent synod was blindly impelled by the absurd or selfish motives of pride hatred and resentment The death of Meletius which happened at the council of Constantinople presented the most favourable opportunity of terminating the schism of Antioch by suffering his aged rival Paulinus peaceably to end his days in the episcopal chair The faith and virtues of Paulinus were unblemished But his cause was supported by the Western churches and the bishops of the synod resolved to perpetuate the mischiefs of discord by the hasty ordination of a perjured candidate  Before the death of Meletius six or eight of his most popular ecclesiastics among whom was Flavian had  abjured  for the sake of peace the bishopric of Antioch Sozomen l vii c Socrates l v c Tillemont thinks it his duty to disbelieve the story but he owns that there are many circumstances in the life of Flavian which  seem  inconsistent with the praises of Chrysostom and the character of a saint Mem Eccles tom x p  rather than to betray the imagined dignity of the East which had been illustrated by the birth and death of the Son of God Such unjust and disorderly proceedings forced the gravest members of the assembly to dissent and to secede and the clamorous majority which remained masters of the field of

twentyseventh and thirtysecond orations were pronounced in the several stages of this business The peroration of the last tom i p in which he takes a solemn leave of men and angels the city and the emperor the East and the West c is pathetic and almost sublime  instead of derogating from the truth of his evidence affords an additional proof of the spirit which actuated the deliberations of the synod Their unanimous suffrage had confirmed the pretensions which the bishop of Constantinople derived from the choice of the people and the approbation of the emperor But Gregory soon became the victim of malice and envy The bishops of the East his strenuous adherents provoked by his moderation  in the affairs of Antioch abandoned him without support to the adverse faction of the Egyptians who disputed the validity of his election and rigorously asserted the obsolete canon that prohibited the licentious practice of episcopal translations The pride or the humility of Gregory prompted him to decline a contest which might have been imputed to ambition and avarice and he publicly offered not without some mixture of indignation to renounce the government of a church which had been restored and almost created by his labours His resignation was accepted by the synod and by the emperor with more readiness than he seems to have expected At the time when he might have hoped to enjoy the fruits of his victory his episcopal throne was filled by the senator Nectarius and the new archbishop accidentally recommended by his easy temper and venerable aspect was obliged to delay the ceremony of his consecration till he had previously dispatched the rites of his baptism  The whimsical ordination of Nectarius is attested by Sozomen l vii c but Tillemont observes Mem Eccles tom ix p Après tout ce narré de Sozomene est si honteux pour tous ceux qu'il y mele et surtout pour Theodose qu'il vaut mieux travailler à le detruire qu'à le soutenir an admirable canon of criticism  After this remarkable experience of the ingratitude of princes and prelates Gregory retired once more to his obscure solitude of Cappadocia where he employed the remainder of his life about eight years in the exercises of poetry and devotion The title of Saint has been added to  his name but the tenderness of his heart  I can only be understood to mean that such was his natural temper when it was not hardened or inflamed by religious zeal From his retirement he exhorts Nectarius to prosecute the heretics of Constantinople  and the elegance of his genius reflect a more pleasing lustre on the memory of Gregory Nazianzen  It was not enough that Theodosius had suppressed  Edicts of Theodosius against the heretics A D  the insolent reign of Arianism or that he had abundantly revenged the injuries which the Catholics sustained from the zeal of Constantius and Valens The orthodox emperor considered every heretic as a rebel against the supreme powers of heaven and of earth and each of those powers might exercise their peculiar jurisdiction over the soul and body of the guilty The decrees of the council of Constantinople had ascertained the true standard of the faith and the ecclesiastics who governed the conscience of Theodosius suggested the most effectual methods of persecution In the space of fifteen years he promulgated at least fifteen severe edicts against the heretics  See the Theodosian Code l xvi tit v leg with Godefroy's commentary on each law and his general summary or  Paratition  tom vi p  more especially against those who rejected the doctrine of the Trinity and to deprive them of every hope of escape he sternly enacted that if any laws or rescripts should be alleged in their favour the judges should consider them as the illegal productions either of fraud or forgery The penal statutes were directed against the ministers the assembles and the persons of the heretics and the passions of the legislator were expressed  in the language of declamation and invective I The heretical teachers who usurped the sacred titles of Bishops or Presbyters were not only excluded from the privileges and emoluments so liberally granted to the orthodox clergy but they were exposed to the heavy penalties of exile and confiscation if they presumed to preach the doctrine or to practise the rites of their  accursed  sects A fine of ten pounds of gold above four hundred pounds Sterling was imposed on every person who should dare to confer or receive or promote an heretical ordination and it was reasonably expected that if the race of pastors could be extinguished their helpless flocks would be compelled by ignorance and hunger to return within the pale of the Catholic Church II The rigorous prohibition of conventicles was carefully extended to every possible circumstance in which the heretics could assemble with the intention of worshipping God and Christ according to the dictates of their conscience Their religious meetings whether public or secret by day or by night in cities or in the country were equally proscribed by the edicts of Theodosius and the building or ground which had been used for that illegal purpose was forfeited to the Imperial domain III It was supposed that the error of the heretics could proceed only from the obstinate temper of their minds and that such a temper was a fit object of censure and punishment The anathemas of the church were fortified by a sort of civil excommunication which separated them from their fellowcitizens by a peculiar brand of  infamy and this declaration of the supreme magistrate tended to justify or at least to excuse the insults of a fanatic populace The sectaries were gradually disqualified for the possession of honourable or lucrative employments and Theodosius was satisfied with his own justice when he decreed that as the Eunomians distinguished the nature of the Son from that of the Father they should be incapable of making their wills or of receiving any advantage from testamentary donations The guilt of the Manichaean heresy was esteemed of such magnitude that it could be expiated only by the death of the offender and the same capital punishment was inflicted on the Audians or  Quartodecimans  They always kept their Easter like the Jewish Passover on the fourteenth day of the first moon after the vernal equinox and thus pertinaciously opposed the Roman church

meaner criminals who assumed the merit of an early repentance If any credit could be allowed to confessions extorted by fear or pain and to vague reports the offspring of malice and credulity the heresy of the Priscillianists would be found to include the various abominations of magic of impiety and of lewdness  The scandalous calumnies of Augustin Pope Leo c which Tillemont swallows like a child and Lardner refutes like a man may suggest some candid suspicions in favour of the older Gnostics  Priscillian who wandered about the world in the company of his spiritual sisters was accused of praying starknaked in the midst of the congregation and it was confidently asserted that the effects of his criminal intercourse with the daughter of Euchrocia had been suppressed by means still more odious and criminal But an accurate or rather a candid enquiry will discover that if the Priscillianists violated the laws of nature it was not by the licentiousness but by the austerity of their lives They absolutely condemned the use of the marriagebed and the peace of families was often disturbed by indiscreet separations They enjoined or recommended a total abstinence from all animal food and their  continual prayers fasts and vigils inculcated a rule of strict and perfect devotion The speculative tenets of the sect concerning the person of Christ and the nature of the human soul were derived from the Gnostic and Manichaean system and this vain philosophy which had been transported from Egypt to Spain was ill adapted to the grosser spirits of the West The obscure disciples of Priscillian suffered languished and gradually disappeared his tenets were rejected by the clergy and people but his death was the subject of a long and vehement controversy while some arraigned and others applauded the justice of his sentence It is with pleasure that we can observe the humane inconsistency of the most illustrious saints and bishops Ambrose of Milan  Ambros tom ii epist xxiv p  and Martin of Tours  In the Sacred History and the Life of St Martin Sulpicius Severus uses some caution but he declares himself more freely in the Dialogues iii Martin was reproved however by his own conscience and by an angel nor could he afterwards perform miracles with so much ease  who on this occasion asserted the cause of toleration They pitied the unhappy men who had been executed at Treves they refused to hold communion with their episcopal murderers and if Martin deviated from that generous resolution his motives were laudable and his repentance was exemplary The bishops of Tours and Milan pronounced without hesitation the eternal damnation of heretics but they were surprised and shocked by the bloody image of their temporal death and the honest feelings of  nature resisted the artificial prejudices of theology The humanity of Ambrose and Martin was confirmed by the scandalous irregularity of the proceedings against Priscillian and his adherents The civil and ecclesiastical ministers had transgressed the limits of their respective provinces The secular judge had presumed to receive an appeal and to pronounce a definitive sentence in a matter of faith and episcopal jurisdiction The bishops had disgraced themselves by exercising the function of accusers in a criminal prosecution The cruelty of Ithacius  The Catholic presbyter Sulp Sever l ii p and the pagan Orator Pacat in Panegyr Vet xii reprobate with equal indignation the character and conduct of Ithacius  who beheld the tortures and solicited the death of the heretics provoked the just indignation of mankind and the vices of that profligate bishop were admitted as a proof that his zeal was instigated by the sordid motives of interest Since the death of Priscillian the rude attempts of persecution have been refined and methodised in the holy office which assigns their distinct parts to the ecclesiastical and secular powers The devoted victim is regularly delivered by the priest to the magistrate and by the magistrate to the executioner and the inexorable sentence of the church which declares the spiritual guilt of the offender is expressed in the mild language of pity and intercession  Among the ecclesiastics who illustrated the  Ambrose archbishop of Milan A D  reign of Theodosius Gregory Nazianzen was distinguished by the talents of an eloquent preacher  the reputation of miraculous gifts added weight and dignity to the monastic virtues of Martin of Tours  The life of St Martin and the Dialogues concerning his miracles contain facts adapted to the grossest barbarism in a style not unworthy of the Augustan age So natural is the alliance between good taste and good sense that I am always astonished by this contrast  but the palm of episcopal vigour and ability was justly claimed by the intrepid Ambrose  The short and superficial life of St Ambrose by his deacon Paulinus Appendix ad edit Benedict p ixv has the merit of original evidence Tillemont Mem Eccles tom x p and the Benedictine editors p xxxilxiii have laboured with their usual diligence  He was descended from a noble family of Romans his father had exercised the important office of Praetorian praefect of Gaul and the son after passing through the studies of a liberal education attained in the regular gradation of civil honours the station of consular of Liguria a province which included the Imperial residence of Milan At the age of thirtyfour and before he had received the sacrament of baptism Ambrose to his own surprise and to that of the world was suddenly transformed from a governor to an archbishop Without the least mixture as it is said of art or intrigue the whole body of the people unanimously saluted him with the episcopal title the concord and perseverance of their acclamations were ascribed to a praeternatural impulse and the reluctant magistrate was compelled to undertake a spiritual office for which he was not prepared by the habits and occupations of his former life But the active force of his genius soon qualified him to exercise with zeal  and prudence the duties of his ecclesiastical jurisdiction and while he cheerfully renounced the vain and splendid trappings of temporal greatness he condescended for the good of the church to direct the conscience of the emperors and to controul the administration of the empire Gratian loved and revered him as a father and the elaborate treatise on the saith of the Trinity was designed for the instruction of the young prince After his tragic death at a time when the empress Justina trembled for her own safety and for that of her son Valentinian the archbishop of Milan was dispatched on two different embassies to the court of Treves He exercised with equal firmness and dexterity the powers of his spiritual and political characters and perhaps contributed by his authority and eloquence to check the ambition of Maximus and to protect the peace of Italy  Ambrose himself tom ii epist xxiv p gives the emperor a very spirited account of his own embassy  Ambrose had devoted his life and his abilities to the service of the church Wealth was the object of his contempt he had renounced his private patrimony and he sold without hesitation the consecrated plate for the redemption of captives The clergy and people of Milan were attached to their archbishop and he deserved the esteem without soliciting the favour or apprehending the displeasure of his feeble sovereigns  The government of Italy and of the young  His successful opposition to the empres Justina A D April April  emperor naturally devolved to his mother Justina a woman of beauty and spirit but who in the  midst of an orthodox people had the misfortune of professing the Arian heresy which she endeavoured to instil into the mind of her son Justina was persuaded that a Roman emperor might claim in his own dominions the public exercise of his religion and she proposed to the archbishop as a moderate and reasonable concession that he should resign the use of a single church either in the city or suburbs of Milan But the conduct of Ambrose was governed by very different principles  His own representation of his principles and conduct tom ii epist xx xxi xxii p is one of the curious monuments of ecclesiastical antiquity It contains two letters to his sister Marcellina with a petition to Valentinian and the sermon  de Basilicis non tradendis  The palaces of the earth might indeed belong to Caesar but the churches were the houses of God and within the limits of his diocese he himself as the lawful successor of the apostles was the only minister of God The privileges of Christianity temporal as well as spiritual were confined to the true believers and the mind of Ambrose was satisfied that his own theological opinions were the standard of truth and orthodoxy The archbishop who refused to hold any conference or negociation with the instruments of Satan declared with modest firmness his resolution to die a martyr rather than to yield to the impious sacrilege and Justina who resented the refusal as an act of insolence and rebellion hastily determined to exert the Imperial prerogative of her son As she desired to perform her public devotions on the approaching festival  of Easter Ambrose was ordered to appear before the council He obeyed the summons with the respect of a faithful subject but he was followed without his consent by an innumerable people they pressed with impetuous zeal against the gates of the palace and the affrighted ministers of Valentinian instead of pronouncing a sentence of exile on the archbishop of Milan humbly requested that he would interpose his authority to protect the person of the emperor and to restore the tranquillity of the capital But the promises which Ambrose received and communicated were soon violated by a perfidious court and during six of the most solemn days which Christian piety has set apart for the exercise of religion the city was agitated by the irregular convulsions of tumult and fanaticism The officers of the household were directed to prepare first the Portian and afterwards the new  Basilica  for the immediate reception of the emperor and his mother The splendid canopy and hangings of the royal seat were arranged in the customary manner but it was found necessary to defend them by a strong guard from the insults of the populace The Arian ecclesiastics who ventured to shew themselves in the streets were exposed to the most imminent danger of their lives and Ambrose enjoyed the merit and reputation of rescuing his personal enemies from the hands of the enraged multitude  But while he laboured to restrain the effects of their zeal the pathetic vehemence of his sermons continually inflamed the angry and seditious temper  of the people of Milan The characters of Eve of the wife of Job of Jezabel of Herodias were indecently applied to the mother of the emperor and her desire to obtain a church for the Arians was compared to the most cruel persecutions which Christianity had endured under the reign of Paganism The measures of the court served only to expose the magnitude of the evil A fine of two hundred pounds of gold was imposed on the corporate body of merchants and manufacturers an order was signified in the name of the emperor to all the officers and inferior servants of the courts of justice that during the continuance of the public disorders they should strictly confine themselves to their houses and the ministers of Valentinian imprudently confessed that the most respectable part of the citizens of Milan was attached to the cause of their archbishop He was again solicited to restore peace to his country by a timely compliance with the will of his sovereign The reply of Ambrose was couched in the most humble and respectful terms which might however be interpreted as a serious declaration of civil war  "His life and fortune were in the hands of the emperor but he would never betray the church of Christ or degrade the dignity of the episcopal character In such a cause he was prepared to suffer whatever the malice of the daemon could inflict and he only wished to die in the presence of his faithful flock and at the foot of the altar  he  had not contributed to excite but it was in the power of God alone to appease  the rage of the people he deprecated the scenes of blood and confusion which were likely to ensue and it was his fervent prayer that he might not survive to behold the ruin of a flourishing city and perhaps the desolation of all Italy  Retz had a similar message from the queen to request that he would appease the tumult of Paris It was no longer in his power c A quoi j'ajoutai tout ce que vous pouvez vous imaginer de respect de douleur de regret et de soumission c Memoires tom i p Certainly I do not compare either the causes or the men yet the coadjutor himself had some idea p of imitating St Ambrose  "  The obstinate bigotry of Justina would have endangered the empire of her son if in this contest with the church and people of Milan she could have depended on the active obedience of the troops of the palace A large body of Goths had marched to occupy the  Basilica  which was the object of the dispute and it might be expected from the Arian principles and barbarous manners of these foreign mercenaries that they would not entertain any scruples in the execution of the most sanguinary orders They were encountered on the sacred threshold by the archbishop who thundering against them a sentence of excommunication asked them in the tone of a father and a master Whether it was to invade the house of God that they had implored the hospitable protection of the republic The suspense of the Barbarians allowed some hours for a more effectual negociation and the empress was persuaded by the advice of her wisest counsellors to leave the Catholics in possession of all the churches of Milan and to dissemble till a  more convenient season her intentions of revenge The mother of Valentinian could never forgive the triumph of Ambrose and the royal youth uttered a passionate exclamation that his own servants were ready to betray him into the hands of an insolent priest  The laws of the empire some of which were  A D  inscribed with the name of Valentinian still condemned the Arian heresy and seemed to excuse the resistance of the Catholics By the influence of Justina an edict of toleration was promulgated in all the provinces which were subject to the court of Milan the free exercise of their religion was granted to those who professed the faith of Rimini and the emperor declared that all persons who should infringe this sacred and salutary constitution should be capitally punished as the enemies of the public peace  Sozomen alone l vii c throws this luminous fact into a dark and perplexed narrative  The character and language of the archbishop of Milan may justify the suspicion that his conduct soon afforded a reasonable ground or at least a specious pretence to the Arian ministers who watched the opportunity of surprising him in some act of disobedience to a law which he strangely represents as a law of blood and tyranny A sentence of easy and honourable banishment was pronounced which enjoined Ambrose to depart from Milan without delay whilst it permitted him to chuse the place of his exile and the number of his companions But the authroity of the saints who have preached and practised the maxims of  passive loyalty appeared to Ambrose of less moment than the extreme and pressing danger of the church He boldly refused to obey and his refusal was supported by the unanimous consent of his faithful people  Excubabat pia plebs in ecclesiâ mori parata cum episcopo suo Nos adhuc frigidi excitabamur tamen civitate attonitâ atque turbatâ Augustin Confession l ix c  They guarded by turns the person of their archbishop the gates of the cathedral and the episcopal palace were strongly secured and the Imperial troops who had formed the blockade were unwilling to risk the attack of that impregnable fortress The numerous poor who had been relieved by the liberality of Ambrose embraced the fair occasion of signalising their zeal and gratitude and as the patience of the multitude might have been exhausted by the length and uniformity of nocturnal vigils he prudently introduced into the church of Milan the useful institution of a loud and regular psalmody While he maintained this arduous contest he was instructed by a dream to open the earth in a place where the remains of two martyrs Gervasius and Protasius  Tillemont Mem Eccless tom ii p Many churches in Italy Gaul c were dedicated to these unknown martyrs of whom St Gervase seems to have been more fortunate than his companion  had been deposited above three hundred years Immediately under the pavement of the church two perfect skeletons were found  Invenimus mirae magnitudinis viros duos ut prisca aetas ferebat Tom ii epist xxii p The size of these skeletons was fortunately or skilfully suited to the popular prejudice of the gradual decrease of the human stature which has prevailed in every age since the time of Homer  Grandiaque effossis mirabitur ossa sepulchris  with the heads separated from their  bodies and a plentiful effusion of blood The holy relics were presented in solemn pomp to the veneration of the people and every circumstance of this fortunate discovery was admirably adapted to promote the designs of Ambrose The bones of the martyrs their blood their garments were supposed to contain a healing power and the praeternatural influence was communicated to the most distant objects without losing any part of its original virtue The extraordinary cure of a blind man  Ambros tom ii epist xxii p Augustin Confes l ix c de Civitat Dei l xxii c Paulin in Vitâ St Ambros c in Append Benedict p The blind man's name was Severus he touched the holy garment recovered his sight and devoted the rest of his life at least twentyfive years to the service of the church I should recommend this miracle to our divines if it did not prove the worship of relics as well as the Nicene creed  and the reluctant confessions of several daemoniacs appeared to justify the faith and sanctity of Ambrose and the truth of those miracles is attested by Ambrose himself by his secretary Paulinus and by his proselyte the celebrated Augustin who at that time professed the art of rhetoric in Milan The reason of the present age may possibly approve the incredulity of Justina and her Arian court who derided the theatrical representations which were exhibited by the contrivance and at the expence of the archbishop  Paulin in Vit St Ambros c in Append Benedict p  Their effect however on the minds of the people was rapid and irresistible and the feeble sovereign of Italy found himself  unable to contend with the favourite of heaven The powers likewise of the earth interposed in the defence of Ambrose the disinterested advice of Theodosius was the genuine result of piety and friendship and the mask of religious zeal concealed the hostile and ambitious designs of the tyrant of Gaul  Tillemont Mem Eccles tom x p He partially allows the mediation of Theodosius and capriciously rejects that of Maximus though it is attested by Prosper Sozomen and Theodoret    The reign of Maximus might have ended in  Maximus invades Italy A D August  peace and prosperity could he have contented himself with the possession of three ample countries which now constitute the three most flourishing kingdoms of modern Europe But the aspiring usurper whose sordid ambition was not dignified by the love of glory and of arms considered his actual forces as the instruments only of his future greatness and his success was the immediate cause of his destruction The wealth which he extorted  The modest censure of Sulpicius Dialog iii inflicts a much deeper wound than the feeble declamation of Pacatus xii  from the oppressed provinces of Gaul Spain and Britain was employed in levying and maintaining a formidable army of Barbarians collected for the most part from the fiercest nations of Germany The conquest of Italy was the object of his hopes and preparations and he secretly meditated the ruin of an innocent youth whose government was abhorred and despised by his Catholic subjects But as Maximus wished to occupy without resistance the passes of  the Alps he received with perfidious smiles Domninus of Syria the ambassador of Valentinian and pressed him to accept the aid of a considerable body of troops for the service of a Pannonian war The penetration of Ambrose had discovered the snares of an enemy under the professions of friendship  Esto tutior adversus hominem pacis involucro tegentem was the wise caution of Ambrose tom ii p after his return from his second embassy  but the Syrian Domninus was corrupted or deceived by the liberal favour of the court of Treves and the council of Milan obstinately rejected the suspicion of danger with a blind confidence which was the effect not of courage but of fear The march of the auxiliaries was guided by the ambassador and they were admitted without distrust into the fortresses of the Alps But the crafty tyrant followed with hasty and silent footsteps in the rear and as he diligently intercepted all intelligence of his motions the gleam of armour and the dust excited by the troops of cavalry first announced the hostile approach of a stranger to the gates of Milan In this extremity Justina and her son might accuse their own imprudence and the perfidious arts of Maximus but they wanted time and force and resolution to stand against the Gauls and Germans either in the field or within the walls of a large and disaffected city Flight was their only hope Aquileia their only refuge and as Maximus now displayed his genuine character the brother of Gratian might expect the same fate from the hands of the same assassin  Maximus entered Milan in triumph and if the wise archbishop refused a dangerous and criminal connection with the usurper he might indirectly contribute to the success of his arms by inculcating from the pulpit the duty of resignation rather than that of resistance  Baronius A D No applies to this season of public distress some of the penitential sermons of the archbishop  The unfortunate Justina reached Aquileia in safety but she distrusted the strength of the fortifications she dreaded the event of a siege and she resolved to implore the protection of the great Theodosius whose power and virtue were celebrated in all the countries of the West A vessel was secretly provided to transport the Imperial family they embarked with precipitation in one of the obscure harbours of Venetia or Istria traversed the whole extent of the Hadriatic and Ionian seas turned the extreme promontory of Peloponnesus and after a long but successful navigation reposed themselves in the port of Thessalonica All the subjects of Valentinian deserted the cause of a prince who by his abdication had absolved  Flight of Valentinian  them from the duty of allegiance and if the little city of Aemona on the verge of Italy had not presumed to stop the career of his inglorious victory Maximus would have obtained without a struggle the sole possession of the western empire  Instead of inviting his royal guests to the palace  Theodosius takes arms in the cause of Valentinian A D  of Constantinople Theodosius had some unknown reasons to fix their residence at Thessalonica but  these reasons did not proceed from contempt or indifference as he speedily made a visit to that city accompanied by the greatest part of his court and senate After the first tender expressions of friendship and sympathy the pious emperor of the East gently admonished Justina that the guilt of heresy was sometimes punished in this world as well as in the next and that the public profession of the Nicene faith would be the most efficacious step to promote the restoration of her son by the satisfaction which it must occasion both on earth and in heaven The momentous question of peace or war was referred by Theodosius to the deliberation of his council and the arguments which might be alleged on the side of honour and justice had acquired since the death of Gratian a considerable degree of additional weight The persecution of the Imperial family to which Theodosius himself had been indebted for his fortune was now aggravated by recent and repeated injuries Neither oaths nor treaties could restrain the boundless ambition of Maximus and the delay of vigorous and decisive measures instead of prolonging the blessings of peace would expose the eastern empire to the danger of an hostile invasion The Barbarians who had passed the Danube had lately assumed the character of soldiers and subjects but their native fierceness was yet untamed and the operations of a war which would exercise their valour and diminish their numbers might tend to relieve the provinces from an intolerable oppression Notwithstanding these specious and solid reasons  which were approved by a majority of the council Theodosius still hesitated whether he should draw the sword in a contest which could no longer admit any terms of reconciliation and his magnanimous character was not disgraced by the apprehensions which he felt for the safety of his infant sons and the welfare of his exhausted people In this moment of anxious doubt while the fate of the Roman world depended on the resolution of a single man the charms of the princess Galla most powerfully pleaded the cause of her brother Valentinian  The flight of Valentinian and the love of Theodosius for his sister are related by Zosimus l iv p Tillemont produces some weak and ambiguous evidence to antedate the second marriage of Theodosius Hist des Empereurs tom v p and consequently to refute ces contes de Zosime qui seroient trop contraires à la pieté de Theodose  The heart of Theodosius was softened by the tears of beauty his affections were insensibly engaged by the graces of youth and innocence the art of Justina managed and directed the impulse of passion and the celebration of the royal nuptials was the assurance and signal of the civil war The unfeeling critics who consider every amorous weakness as an indelible stain on the memory of a great and orthodox emperor are inclined on this occasion to dispute the suspicious evidence of the historian Zosimus For my own part I shall frankly confess that I am willing to find or even to seek in the revolutions of the world some traces of the mild and tender sentiments of domestic life and amidst the crowd of fierce and ambitious conquerors I can distinguish with peculiar complacency  a gentle hero who may be supposed to receive his armour from the hands of love The alliance of the Persian king was secured by the faith of treaties the martial Barbarians were persuaded to follow the standard or to respect the frontiers of an active and liberal monarch and the dominions of Theodosius from the Euphrates to the Hadriatic resounded with the preparations of war both by land and sea The skilful disposition of the forces of the East seemed to multiply their numbers and distracted the attention of Maximus He had reason to fear that a chosen body of troops under the command of the intrepid Arbogastes would direct their march along the banks of the Danube and boldly penetrate through the Rhaetian provinces into the centre of Gaul A powerful fleet was equipped in the harbours of Greece and Epirus with an apparent design that as soon as the passage had been opened by a naval victory Valentinian and his mother should land in Italy proceed without delay to Rome and occupy the majestic seat of religion and empire In the mean while Theodosius himself advanced at the head of a brave and disciplined army to encounter his unworthy rival who after the siege of Aemona had fixed his camp in the neighbourhood of Siscia a city of Pannonia strongly fortified by the broad and rapid stream of the Save  The veterans who still remembered the long  Defeat and death of Maximus A D JuneAugust  resistance and successive resources of the tyrant Magnentius might prepare themselves for the labours of three bloody campaigns But the contest  with his successor who like him had usurped the throne of the West was easily decided in the term of two months  See Godefroy's Chronology of the Laws Cod Theodos tom i p cxix  and within the space of two hundred miles The superior genius of the emperor of the East might prevail over the feeble Maximus who in this important crisis shewed himself destitute of military skill or personal courage but the abilities of Theodosius were seconded by the advantage which he possessed of a numerous and active cavalry The Huns the Alani and after their example the Goths themselves were formed into squadrons of archers who fought on horseback and confounded the steady valour of the Gauls and Germans by the rapid motions of a Tartar war After the fatigue of a long march in the heat of summer they spurred their foaming horses into the waters of the Save swam the river in the presence of the enemy and instantly charged and routed the troops who guarded the high ground on the opposite side Marcellinus the tyrant's brother advanced to support them with the select cohorts which were considered as the hope and strength of the army The action which had been interrupted by the approach of night was renewed in the morning and after a sharp conflict the surviving remnant of the bravest soldiers of Maximus threw down their arms at the feet of the conqueror Without suspending his march to receive the loyal acclamations of the citizens of Aemona Theodosius pressed forwards to terminate  the war by the death or captivity of his rival who fled before him with the diligence of fear From the summit of the Julian Alps he descended with such incredible speed into the plain of Italy that he reached Aquileia on the evening of the first day and Maximus who found himself encompassed on all sides had scarcely time to shut the gates of the city But the gates could not long resist the effort of a victorious enemy and the despair the disaffection the indifference of the soldiers and people hastened the downfall of the wretched Maximus He was dragged from his throne rudely stripped of the Imperial ornaments the robe the diadem and the purple slippers and conducted like a malefactor to the camp and presence of Theodosius at a place about three miles from Aquileia The behaviour of the emperor was not intended to insult and he shewed some disposition to pity and forgive the tyrant of the West who had never been his personal enemy and was now become the object of his contempt Our sympathy is the most forcibly excited by the misfortunes to which we are exposed and the spectacle of a proud competitor now prostrate at his feet could not fail of producing very serious and solemn thoughts in the mind of the victorious emperor But the feeble emotion of involuntary pity was checked by his regard for public justice and the memory of Gratian and he abandoned the victim to the pious zeal of the soldiers who drew him out of the Imperial presence and instantly separated his head from his body The intelligence of his defeat  and death was received with sincere or welldissembled joy his son Victor on whom he had conferred the title of Augustus died by the order perhaps by the hand of the bold Arbogastes and all the military plans of Theodosius were successfully executed When he had thus terminated the civil war with less difficulty and bloodshed than he might naturally expect he employed the winter months of his residence at Milan to restore the state of the afflicted provinces and early in the spring he made after the example of Constantine and Constantius his triumphal entry into the ancient capital of the Roman empire  Besides the hints which may be gathered from chronicles and ecclesiastical history Zosimus l iv p

Claudian always seems afraid of exalting the father above the son  might furnish the subject of a sincere and ample panegyric The  wisdom of his laws and the success of his arms rendered his administration respectable in the eyes both of his subjects and of his enemies He loved and practised the virtues of domestic life which seldom hold their residence in the palaces of kings Theodosius was chaste and temperate he enjoyed without excess the sensual and social pleasures of the table and the warmth of his amorous passions was never diverted from their lawful objects The proud titles of Imperial greatness were adorned by the tender names of a faithful husband an indulgent father his uncle was raised by his affectionate esteem to the rank of a second parent Theodosius embraced as his own the children of his brother and sister and the expressions of his regard were extended to the most distant and obscure branches of his numerous kindred His familiar friends were judiciously selected from among those persons who in the equal intercourse of private life had appeared before his eyes without a mask the consciousness of personal and superior merit enabled him to despise the accidental distinction of the purple and he proved by his conduct that he had forgotten all the injuries while he most gratefully remembered all the favours and services which he had received before he ascended the throne of the Roman empire The serious or lively tone of his conversation was adapted to the age the rank or the character of his subjects whom he admitted into his society and the affability of his manners displayed the image of his mind Theodosius respected the simplicity of  the good and virtuous every art every talent of an useful or even of an innocent nature was rewarded by his judicious liberality and except the heretics whom he persecuted with implacable hatred the diffusive circle of his benevolence was circumscribed only by the limits of the human race The government of a mighty empire may assuredly suffice to occupy the time and the abilities of a mortal yet the diligent prince without aspiring to the unsuitable reputation of profound learning always reserved some moments of his leisure for the instructive amusement of reading History which enlarged his experience was his favourite study The annals of Rome in the long period of eleven hundred years presented him with a various and splendid picture of human life and it has been particularly observed that whenever he perused the cruel acts of Cinna of Marius or of Sylla he warmly expressed his generous detestation of those enemies of humanity and freedom His disinterested opinion of past events was usefully applied as the rule of his own actions and Theodosius has deserved the singular commendation that his virtues always seemed to expand with his fortune the season of his prosperity was that of his moderation and his clemency appeared the most conspicuous after the danger and success of the civil war The Moorish guards of the tyrant had been massacred in the first heat of the victory and a small number of the most obnoxious criminals suffered the punishment of the law But the emperor shewed himself much more attentive to relieve the innocent  than to chastise the guilty The oppressed subjects of the West who would have deemed themselves happy in the restoration of their lands were astonished to receive a sum of money equivalent to their losses and the liberality of the conqueror supported the aged mother and educated the orphan daughters of Maximus  Ambros tom ii epist xl p Pacatus from the want of skill or of courage omits this glorious circumstance  A character thus accomplished might almost excuse the extravagant supposition of the orator Pacatus that if the elder Brutus could be permitted to revisit the earth the stern republican would abjure at the feet of Theodosius his hatred of kings and ingenuously confess that such a monarch was the most faithful guardian of the happiness and dignity of the Roman people  Pacat in Panegyr Vet xii    Yet the piercing eye of the founder of the republic must have discerned two essential imperfections  Faults of Theodosius  which might perhaps have abated his recent love of despotism The virtuous mind of Theodosius was often relaxed by indolence  Zosimus l iv p His partial evidence is marked by an air of candour and truth He observes these vicissitudes of sloth and activity not as a vice but as a singularity in the character of Theodosius  and it was sometimes inflamed by passion  This choleric temper is acknowledged and excused by Victor Sed habes says Ambrose in decent and manly language to his sovereign naturae impetum quem si quis lenire velit cito vertes ad misericordiam si quis stimulet in magis exsuscitas ut cum revocare vix possis tom ii epist li p Theodosius Claud in iv Cons Hon c exhorts his son to moderate his anger  In the pursuit of an important object his active courage  was capable of the most vigorous exertions but as soon as the design was accomplished or the danger was surmounted the hero sunk into inglorious repose and forgetful that the time of a prince is the property of his people resigned himself to the enjoyment of the innocent but trifling pleasures of a luxurious court The natural disposition of Theodosius was hasty and choleric and in a station where none could resist and few would dissuade the fatal consequence of his resentment the humane monarch was justly alarmed by the consciousness of his infirmity and of his power It was the constant study of his life to suppress or regulate the intemperate sallies of passion and the success of his efforts enhanced the merit of his clemency But the painful virtue which claims the merit of victory is exposed to the danger of deseat and the reign of a wise and merciful prince was polluted by an act of cruelty which would stain the annals of Nero or Domitian Within the space of three years the inconsistent historian of Theodosius must relate the generous pardon of the citizens of Antioch and the inhuman massacre of the people of Thessalonica  The lively impatience of the inhabitants of Antioch was never satisfied with their own situation  The sedition of Antioch A D  or with the character and conduct of their successive sovereigns The Arian subjects of Theodosius deplored the loss of their churches and as three rival bishops disputed the throne of Antioch the sentence which decided their pretensions  excited the murmurs of the two unsuccessful congregations The exigencies of the Gothic war and the inevitable expence that accompanied the conclusion of the peace had constrained the emperor to aggravate the weight of the public impositions and the provinces of Asia as they had not been involved in the distress were the less inclined to contribute to the relief of Europe The auspicious period now approached of the tenth year of his reign a festival more grateful to the soldiers who received a liberal donative than to the subjects whose voluntary offerings had been long since converted into an extraordinary and oppressive burthen The edicts of taxation interrupted the repose and pleasures of Antioch and the tribunal of the magistrate was besieged by a suppliant crowd who in pathetic but at first in respectful language solicited the redress of their grievances They were gradually incensed by the pride of their haughty rulers who treated their complaints as a criminal resistance their satirical wit degenerated into sharp and angry invectives and from the subordinate powers of government the invectives of the people insensibly rose to attack the sacred character of the emperor himself Their fury provoked by a feeble opposition discharged itself on the  Feb  images of the Imperial family which were erected as objects of public veneration in the most conspicuous places of the city The statues of Theodosius of his father of his wife Flaccilla of his two sons Arcadius and Honorius were  insolently thrown down from their pedestals broken in pieces or dragged with contempt through the streets and the indignities which were offered to the representations of Imperial majesty sufficiently declared the impious and treasonable wishes of the populace The tumult was almost immediately suppressed by the arrival of a body of archers and Antioch had leisure to reflect on the nature and consequences of her crime  The Christians and Pagans agreed in believing that the sedition of Antioch was excited by the daemons A gigantic woman says Sozomen l vii c paraded the streets with a scourge in her hand An old man says Libanius Orat xii p transformed himself into a youth then a boy c  According to the duty of his office the governor of the province dispatched a faithful narrative of the whole transaction while the trembling citizens intrusted the confession of their crime and the assurance of their repentance to the zeal of Flavian their bishop and to the eloquence of the senator Hilarius the friend and most probably the disciple of Libanius whose genius on this melancholy occasion was not useless to his country  Zosimus in his short and disingenuous account l iv p is certainly mistaken in sending Libanius himself to Constantinople His own orations fix him at Antioch  But the two capitals Antioch and Constantinople were separated by the distance of eight hundred miles and notwithstanding the diligence of the Imperial posts the guilty city was severely punished by a long and dreadful interval of suspence Every rumour agitated the hopes and fears of the Antiochians and they heard with terror that their sovereign  exasperated by the insult which had been offered to his own statues and more especially to those of his beloved wife had resolved to level with the ground the offending city and to massacre without distinction of age or sex the criminal inhabitants  Libanius Orat i p edit Venet declares that under such a reign the fear of a massacre was groundless and absurd especially in the emperor's absence for his presence according to the eloquent slave might have given a sanction to the most bloody acts  many of whom were actually driven by their apprehensions to seek a refuge in the mountains of Syria and the adjacent desert At length twentyfour days after the sedition the  March  general Hellebicus and Caesarius master of the offices declared the will of the emperor and the sentence of Antioch That proud capital was degraded from the rank of a city and the metropolis of the East stripped of its lands its privileges and its revenues was subjected under the humiliating denomination of a village to the jurisdiction of Laodicea  Laodicea on the seacoast sixtyfive miles from Antioch see Noris Epoch SyroMaced Dissert iii p The Antiochians were offended that the dependent city of Seleucia should presume to intercede for them  The Baths the Circus and the theatres were shut and that every source of plenty and pleasure might at the same time be intercepted the distribution of corn was abolished by the severe instructions of Theodosius His commissioners then proceeded to inquire into the guilt of individuals of those who had perpetrated and of those who had not prevented the destruction of the sacred statues The tribunal of Hellebicus and Caesarius encompassed with  armed soldiers was erected in the midst of the Forum The noblest and most wealthy of the citizens of Antioch appeared before them in chains the examination was assisted by the use of torture and their sentence was pronounced or suspended according to the judgment of these extraordinary magistrates The houses of the criminals were exposed to sale their wives and children were suddenly reduced from affluence and luxury to the most abject distress and a bloody execution was expected to conclude the horrors of a day  As the days of the tumult depend on the  moveable  festival of Easter they can only be determined by the previous determination of the year The year has been preferred after a laborious inquiry by Tillemont Hist des Emp tom v p and Montfaucon Chrysostom tom xiii p  which the preacher of Antioch the eloquent Chrysostom has represented as a lively image of the last and universal judgment of the world But the ministers of Theodosius performed with reluctance the cruel task which had been assigned them they dropped a gentle tear over the calamities of the people and they listened with reverence to the pressing solicitations of the monks and hermits who descended in swarms from the mountains  Chrysostom opposes  their  courage which was not attended with much risk to the cowardly flight of the Cynics  Hellebicus and Caesarius were persuaded to suspend the execution of their sentence and it was agreed that the former should remain at Antioch while the latter returned with all possible speed to Constantinople and presumed once more to consult the will of his sovereign The resentment of  Clemency of Theodosius  Theodosius had already subsided the deputies of the people both the bishop and the orator had obtained a favourable audience and the reproaches of the emperor were the complaints of injured friendship rather than the stern menaces of pride and power A free and general pardon was granted to the city and citizens of Antioch the prisondoors were thrown open the senators who despaired of their lives recovered the possession of their houses and estates and the capital of the East was restored to the enjoyment of her ancient dignity and splendour Theodosius condescended to praise the senate of Constantinople who had generously interceded for their distressed brethren he rewarded the eloquence of Hilarius with the government of Palestine and dismissed the bishop of Antioch with the warmest expressions of his respect and gratitude A thousand new statues arose to the clemency of Theodosius the  April  applause of his subjects was ratified by the approbation of his own heart and the emperor confessed that if the exercise of justice is the most important duty the indulgence of mercy is the most exquisite pleasure of a sovereign  The sedition of Antioch is represented in a lively and almost dramatic manner by two orators who had their respective shares of interest and merit See Libanius Orat xiv xv p edit Morel Orat

cause and was productive of much  more dreadful consequences That great city the metropolis of all the Illyrian provinces had been protected from the dangers of the Gothic war by strong fortifications and a numerous garrison Botheric the general of those troops and as it should seem from his name a Barbarian had among his slaves a beautiful boy who excited the impure desires of one of the charioteers of the Circus The insolent and brutal lover was thrown into prison by the order of Botheric and he sternly rejected the importunate clamours of the multitude who on the day of the public games lamented the absence of their favourite and considered the skill of a charioteer as an object of more importance than his virtue The resentment of the people was embittered by some previous disputes and as the strength of the garrison had been drawn away for the service of the Italian war the feeble remnant whose numbers were reduced by desertion could not save the unhappy general from their licentious fury Botheric and several of his principal officers were inhumanly murdered their mangled bodies were dragged about the streets and the emperor who then resided at Milan was surprised by the intelligence of the audacious and wanton cruelty of the people of Thessalonica The sentence of a dispassionate judge would have inflicted a severe punishment on the authors of the crime and the merit of Botheric might contribute to exasperate the grief and indignation of his master The fiery and choleric temper of Theodosius was impatient of the dilatory forms of a judicial enquiry  and he hastily resolved that the blood of his lieutenant should be expiated by the blood of the guilty people Yet his mind still fluctuated between the counsels of clemency and of revenge the zeal of the bishops had almost extorted from the reluctant emperor the promise of a general pardon his passion was again inflamed by the flattering suggestions of his minister Rufinus and after Theodosius had dispatched the messengers of death he attempted when it was too late to prevent the execution of his orders The punishment of a Roman city was blindly committed to the undistinguishing sword of the Barbarians and the hostile preparations were concerted with the dark and perfidious artifice of an illegal conspiracy The people of Thessalonica were treacherously invited in the name of their sovereign to the games of the Circus and such was their insatiate avidity for those amusements that every consideration of fear or suspicion was disreguarded by the numerous spectators As soon as the assembly was complete the soldiers who had secretly been posted round the circus received the signal not of the races but of a general massacre The promiscuous carnage continued three hours without discrimination of strangers or natives of age or sex of innocence or guilt the most moderate accounts state the number of the slain at seven thousand and it is affirmed by some writers that more than fifteen thousand victims were sacrificed to the manes of Botheric A foreign merchant who had probably no concern in his murder offered his own life and all his wealth to supply  the place of  one  of his two sons but while the father hesitated with equal tenderness while he was doubtful to chuse and unwilling to condemn the soldiers determined his suspense by plunging their daggers at the same moment into the breasts of the defenceless youths The apology of the assassins that they were obliged to produce the prescribed number of heads serves only to increase by an appearance of order and design the horrors of the massacre which was executed by the commands of Theodosius The guilt of the emperor is aggravated by his long and frequent residence at Thessalonica The situation of the unfortunate city the aspect of the streets and buildings the dress and faces of the inhabitants were familiar and even present to his imagination and Theodosius possessed a quick and lively sense of the existence of the people whom he destroyed  The original evidence of Ambrose tom ii epist li p Augustin de Civitat Dei v and Paulinus in Vit Ambros c is delivered in vague expressions of horror and pity It is illustrated by the subsequent and unequal testimonies of Sozomen l vii c Theodoret l v c Theophanes Chronograph p Cedrenus p and Zonaras tom ii l xiii p Zosimus  alone  the partial enemy of Theodosius most unaccountably passes over in silence the worst of his actions    The respectful attachment of the emperor for  Influence and conduct of Ambrose A D  the orthodox clergy had disposed him to love and admire the character of Ambrose who united all the episcopal virtues in the most eminent degree The friends and ministers of Theodosius imitated the example of their sovereign and he observed with more surprise than displeasure that all his secret counsels were immediately communicated  to the archbishop who acted from the laudable persuasion that every measure of civil government may have some connection with the glory of God and the interest of the true religion The monks and populace of Callinicum an obscure town on the frontier of Persia excited by their own fanaticism and by that of their bishop had tumultuously burnt a conventicle of the Valentinians and a synagogue of the Jews The seditious prelate was condemned by the magistrate of the province either to rebuild the synagogue or to repay the damage and this moderate sentence was confirmed by the emperor But it was not confirmed by the archbishop of Milan  See the whole transaction in Ambrose tom ii epist xl xli p and his biographer Paulinus c Bayle and Barbeyrac Morales des Péres c xvii p c have justly condemned the archbishop  He dictated an epistle of censure and reproach more suitable perhaps if the emperor had received the mark of circumcision and renounced the faith of his baptism Ambrose considers the toleration of the Jewish as the persecution of the Christian religion boldly declares that he himself and every true believer would eagerly dispute with the bishop of Callinicum the merit of the deed and the crown of martyrdom and laments in the most pathetic terms that the execution of the sentence would be fatal to the fame and salvation of Theodosius As this private admonition did not produce an immediate effect the archbishop from his pulpit  His sermon is a strange allegory of Jeremiah's rod of an almondtree of the woman who washed and anointed the feet of Christ But the peroration is direct and personal  publicly addressed  the emperor on his throne  Hodie Episcope de me proposuisti Ambrose modestly confessed it but he sternly reprimanded Timasius general of the horse and foot who had presumed to say that the monks of Callinicum deserved punishment  nor would he consent to offer the oblation of the altar till he had obtained from Theodosius a solemn and positive declaration which secured the impunity of the bishop and monks of Callinicum The recantation of Theodosius was sincere  Yet five years afterwards when Theodosius was absent from his spiritual guide he tolerated the Jews and condemned the destruction of their synagogue Cod Theodos l xvi tit viii leg with Godefroy's Commentary tom vi p  and during the term of his residence at Milan his affection for Ambrose was continually increased by the habits of pious and familiar conversation  When Ambrose was informed of the massacre  Pennance of Theodosius A D  of Thessalonica his mind was filled with horror and anguish He retired into the country to indulge his grief and to avoid the presence of Theodosius But as the archbishop was satisfied that a timid silence would render him the accomplice of his guilt he represented in a private letter the enormity of the crime which could only be effaced by the tears of penitence The episcopal vigour of Ambrose was tempered by prudence and he contented himself with signifying  Ambros tom ii epist li p His Epistle is a miserable rhapsody on a noble subject Ambrose could act better than he could write His compositions are destitute of taste or genius without the spirit of Tertullian the copious elegance of Lactantius the lively wit of Jerom or the grave energy of Augustin  an indirect sort of excommunication by the assurance  that he had been warned in a vision not to offer the oblation in the name or in the presence of Theodosius and by the advice that he would confine himself to the use of prayer without presuming to approach the altar of Christ or to receive the holy eucharist with those hands that were still polluted with the blood of an innocent people The emperor was deeply affected by his own reproaches and by those of his spiritual father and after he had bewailed the mischievous and irreparable consequences of his rash fury he proceeded in the accustomed manner to perform his devotions in the great church of Milan He was stopped in the porch by the archbishop who in the tone and language of an ambassador of Heaven declared to his sovereign that private contrition was not sufficient to atone for a public fault or to appease the justice of the offended Deity Theodosius humbly represented that if he had contracted the guilt of homicide David the man after God's own heart had been guilty not only of murder but of adultery  "You have imitated David in his crime imitate then his repentance"  was the reply of the undaunted Ambrose The rigorous conditions of peace and pardon were accepted and the public pennance of the emperor Theodosius has been recorded as one of the most honourable events in the annals of the church According to the mildest rules of ecclesiastical discipline which were established in the fourth century the crime of homicide was expiated by the penitence of twenty  years  According to the discipline of St Basil Canon lvi the voluntary homicide was  four  years a mourner  five  an hearer  seven  in a prostrate state and  four  in a standing posture I have the original Beveridge Pandect tom ii p and a translation Chardon Hist des Sacremens tom iv p of the Canonical Epistles of St Basil  and as it was impossible in the period of human life to purge the accumulated guilt of the massacre of Thessalonica the murderer should have been excluded from the holy communion till the hour of his death But the archbishop consulting the maxims of religious policy granted some indulgence to the rank of his illustrious penitent who humbled in the dust the pride of the diadem and the public edification might be admitted as a weighty reason to abridge the duration of his punishment It was sufficient that the emperor of the Romans stripped of the ensigns of royalty should appear in a mournful and suppliant posture and that in the midst of the church of Milan he should humbly solicit with sighs and tears the pardon of his sins  The pennance of Theodosius is authenticated by Ambrose tom vi de Obit Theodos c p Augustin de Civitat Dei v and Paulinus in Vit Ambros c Socrates is ignorant Sozomen l vii c concise and the copious narrative of Theodoret l v c must be used with precaution  In this spiritual cure Ambrose employed the various methods of mildness and

execution may be  accepted as the worthy fruits of his repentance  Codex Theodos l ix tit xl leg The date and circumstances of this law are perplexed with difficulties but I feel myself inclined to favour the honest efforts of Tillemont Hist des Emp tom v p and Pagi Critica tom i p  Posterity has applauded the virtuous firmness of the archbishop and the example of Theodosius may prove the beneficial influence of those principles which could force a monarch exalted above the apprehension of human punishment to respect the laws and ministers of an invisible Judge  "The prince" says Montesquieu "who is actuated by the hopes and fears of religion may be compared to a lion docile only to the voice and tractable to the hand of his keeper  Un prince qui aime la religion et qui la craint est un lion qui céde à la main qui le flatte ou à la voix qui l'appaise Esprit des Loix l xxiv c  "  The motions of the royal animal will therefore depend on the inclination and interest of the man who has acquired such dangerous authority over him and the priest who holds in his hand the conscience of a king may inflame or moderate his sanguinary passions The cause of humanity and that of persecution have been asserted by the same Ambrose with equal energy and with equal success  After the defeat and death of the tyrant of  Generosity of Theodosius A D  Gaul the Roman world was in the possession of Theodosius He derived from the choice of Gratian his honourable title to the provinces of the East he had acquired the West by the right of conquest and the three years which he spent in Italy were usefully employed to restore the  authority of the laws and to correct the abuses which had prevailed with impunity under the usurpation of Maximus and the minority of Valentinian The name of Valentinian was regularly inserted in the public acts but the tender age and doubtful faith of the son of Justina appeared to require the prudent care of an orthodox guardian and his specious ambition might have excluded the unfortunate youth without a struggle and almost without a murmur from the administration and even from the inheritance of the empire If Theodosius had consulted the rigid maxims of interest and policy his conduct would have been justified by his friends but the generosity of his behaviour on this memorable occasion has extorted the applause of his most inveterate enemies He seated Valentinian on the throne of Milan and without stipulating any present or future advantages restored him to the absolute dominion of all the provinces from which he had been driven by the arms of Maximus To the restitution of his ample patrimony Theodosius added the free and generous gift of the countries beyond the Alps which his successful valour had recovered from the assassin of Gratian  is the niggard praise of Zosimus himself l iv p Augustin says with some happiness of expression Valentinianum misericordissimâ veneratione restituit  Satisfied with the glory which he had acquired by revenging the death of his benefactor and delivering the West from the yoke of tyranny the emperor returned from Milan to Constantinople  and in the peaceful possession of the East insensibly relapsed into his former habits of luxury and indolence Theodosius discharged his obligation to the brother he indulged his conjugal tenderness to the sister of Valentinian and posterity which admires the pure and singular glory of his elevation must applaud his unrivalled generosity in the use of victory  The empress Justina did not long survive her return to Italy and though she beheld the  Character of Valentinian A D  triumph of Theodosius she was not allowed to influence the government of her son  Sozomen l vii c His chronology is very irregular  The pernicious attachment to the Arian sect which Valentinian had imbibed from her example and instructions were soon erased by the lessons of a more orthodox education His growing zeal for the faith of Nice and his filial reverence for the character and authority of Ambrose disposed the Catholics to entertain the most favourable opinion of the virtues of the young emperor of the West  See Ambrose tom ii de Obit Valentinian c c p c c p When the young emperor gave an entertainment he fasted himself he refused to see an handsome actress c Since he ordered his wild beasts to be killed it is ungenerous in Philostorgius l xi c to reproach him with the love of that amusement  They applauded his chastity and temperance his contempt of pleasure his application to business and his tender affection for his two sisters which could not however seduce his impartial equity to pronounce an unjust sentence against the meanest of his subjects But this amiable youth before he had accomplished the  twentieth year of his age was oppressed by domestic treason and the empire was again involved in the horrors of a civil war Arbogastes  Zosimus l iv p praises the enemy of Theodosius But he is detested by Socrates l v c and Orosius l vii c  a gallant soldier of the nation of the Franks held the second rank in the service of Gratian On the death of his master he joined the standard of Theodosius contributed by his valour and military conduct to the destruction of the tyrant and was appointed after the victory mastergeneral of the armies of Gaul His real merit and apparent fidelity had gained the confidence both of the prince and people his boundless liberality corrupted the allegiance of the troops and whilst he was universally esteemed as the pillar of the state the bold and crafty Barbarian was secretly determined either to rule or to ruin the empire of the West The important commands of the army were distributed among the Franks the creatures of Arbogastes were promoted to all the honours and offices of the civil government the progress of the conspiracy removed every faithful servant from the presence of Valentinian and the emperor without power and without intelligence insensibly sunk into the precarious and dependent condition of a captive  Gregory of Tours l ii c p in the second volume of the Historians of France has preserved a curious fragment of Sulpicius Alexander an historian far more valuable than himself  The indignation which he expressed though it might arise only from the rash and impatient temper of youth may be candidly ascribed  to the generous spirit of a prince who felt that he was not unworthy to reign He secretly invited the archbishop of Milan to undertake the office of a mediator as the pledge of his sincerity and the guardian of his safety He contrived to apprise the emperor of the East of his helpless situation and he declared that unless Theodosius could speedily march to his assistance he must attempt to escape from the palace or rather prison of Vienna in Gaul where he had imprudently fixed his residence in the midst of the hostile faction But the hopes of relief were distant and doubtful and as every day furnished some new provocation the emperor without strength or counsel too hastily resolved to risk an immediate contest with his powerful general He received Arbogastes on the throne and as the count approached with some appearance of respect delivered to him a paper which dismissed him from all his employments  "My authority" replied Arbogastes with insulting coolness "does not depend on the smile or the frown of a monarch"  and he contemptuously threw the paper on the ground The indignant monarch snatched at the sword of one of the guards which he struggled to draw from its scabbard and it was not without some degree of violence that he was prevented from using the deadly weapon against his enemy or against himself A few days after this extraordinary quarrel in which he had exposed  His death A D May  his resentment and his weakness the unfortunate Valentinian was found strangled in his apartment and some pains were employed to disguise  the manifest guilt of Arbogastes and to persuade the world that the death of the young emperor had been the voluntary effect of his own despair  Godefroy Dissertat ad Philostorg p has diligently collected all the circumstances of the death of Valentinian II The variations and the ignorance of contemporary writers prove that it was secret  His body was conducted with decent pomp to the sepulchre of Milan and the archbishop pronounced a funeral oration to commemorate his virtue and his misfortunes  De Obitû Valentinian tom ii p He is forced to speak a discreet and obscure language yet he is much bolder than any layman or perhaps any other ecclesiastic would have dared to be  On this occasion the humanity of Ambrose tempted him to make a singular breach in his theological system and to comfort the weeping sisters of Valentinian by the firm assurance that their pious brother though he had not received the sacrament of baptism was introduced without difficulty into the mansions of eternal bliss  See c p c p Don Chardon Hist des Sacremens tom i p who owns that St Ambrose most strenuously maintains the  indispensable  necessity of baptism labours to reconcile the contradiction    The prudence of Arbogastes had prepared the success of his ambitious designs and the provincials  Usurpation of Eugenius A D  in whose breasts every sentiment of patriotism or loyalty were extinguished expected with tame resignation the unknown master whom the choice of a Frank might place on the Imperial throne But some remains of pride and prejudice still opposed the elevation of Arbogastes himself and the judicious Barbarian thought it  more advisable to reign under the name of some dependent Roman He bestowed the purple on the rhetorician Eugenius  Quem sibi Germanus famulum delegerat exul is the contemptuous expression of Claudian iv Cons Hon Eugenius professed Christianity but his secret attachment to Paganism Sozomen l vii c Philostorg l xi c is probable in a grammarian and would secure the friendship of Zosimus l iv p  whom he had already raised from the place of his domestic secretary to the rank of master of the offices In the course both of his private and public service the count had always approved the attachment and abilities of Eugenius his learning and eloquence supported by the gravity of his manners recommended him to the esteem of the people and the reluctance with which he seemed to ascend the throne may inspire a favourable prejudice of his virtue and moderation The ambassadors of the new emperor were immediately dispatched to the court of Theodosius to communicate with affected grief the unfortunate accident of the death of Valentinian and without mentioning the name of Arbogastes to request that the monarch of the East would embrace as his lawful colleague the respectable citizen who had obtained the unanimous suffrage of the armies and provinces of the West  Zosimus l iv p mentions this embassy but he is diverted by another story from relating the event  Theodosius was justly provoked that the perfidy of a Barbarian should have destroyed in a moment the labours and the fruit of his former victory and he was excited by the  tears of his beloved wife  Zosim l iv p He afterwards says p that Galla died in childbed and intimates that the affliction of her husband was extreme but short  to revenge the fate of her unhappy brother and once more to assert by arms the violated majesty of the throne But as the second conquest of the West was a task of difficulty and danger he dismissed with splendid presents and an ambiguous answer the ambassadors of Eugenius and almost two years were consumed in the preparations of the civil war Before  Theodosius prepares for war  he formed any decisive resolution the pious emperor was anxious to discover the will of heave and as the progress of Christianity had silenced the oracles of Delphi and Dodona he consulted an Egyptian monk who possessed in the opinion of the age the gift of miracles and the knowledge of

the face of a woman and without tasting any food that had been prepared by fire or any human art Five days of the week he spent in prayer and meditation but on Saturdays and Sundays he regularly opened a small window and gave audience to the crowd of suppliants who successively flowed from every part of the Christian world The eunuch of Theodosius approached the window with respectful steps proposed his questions concerning the event of the civil war and soon returned with a favourable oracle which animated the courage of the emperor by the assurance of a bloody but infallible victory  Sozomen l vii c Claudian in Eutrop l i mentions the eunuch's journey but he most contemptuously derides the Egyptian dreams and the oracles of the Nile  The accomplishment of the prediction was forwarded by all the means that human prudence could supply The industry of the two mastergenerals Stilicho and Timasius was directed to recruit the numbers and to revive the discipline of the Roman legions The formidable troops of Barbarians marched under the ensigns of their national chieftains The Iberian the Arab and the Goth who gazed on each other with mutual astonishment were enlisted in

were permitted to occupy without resistance the provinces of Pannonia as far as the foot of the Julian Alps and even the passages of the mountains were negligently or perhaps artfully abandoned to the bold invader He descended from the hills and beheld with some astonishment the formidable camp of the Gauls and Germans that covered with arms and tents the open country which extends to the walls of Aquileia and the banks of  the Frigidus  The Frigidus a small though memorable stream in the country of Goretz now called the Vipao falls into the Sontius or Li  nzo above Aquileia some miles from the

must have been choaked with carcasses if the current had not been swelled with blood  This narrow theatre of the war circumscribed by the Alps and the Hadriatic did not allow much room for the operations of military skill the spirit of Arbogastes would have disdained a pardon his guilt extinguished the hope of a negociation and Theodosius was impatient to satisfy his glory and revenge by the chastisement of the assassins of Valentinian Without weighing the natural and artificial obstacles that opposed his efforts the emperor of the East immediately attacked the fortifications of his rivals assigned the post of honourable danger to the Goths and cherished a secret wish that the bloody conflict might diminish the pride and numbers of the conquerors Ten thousand of those auxiliaries and Bacurius general of the Iberians died bravely on the field of battle But the victory was not purchased by their blood the Gauls maintained their advantage and the approach of night protected the disorderly flight or retreat of the troops of Theodosius The emperor retired to the adjacent hills where he passed a disconsolate night without sleep without provisions and without  hopes  Theodoret affirms that St John and St Philip appeared to the waking or sleeping emperor on horseback c This is the first instance of apostolic chivalry which afterwards became so popular in Spain and in the Crusades  except that strong assurance which under the most desperate circumstances the independent mind may derive from the contempt of fortune and of life The triumph of Eugenius was celebrated by the insolent and dissolute joy of his camp whilst the active and vigilant Arbogastes secretly detached a considerable body of troops to occupy the passes of the mountains and to encompass the rear of the Eastern army The dawn of day discovered to the eyes of Theodosius the extent and the extremity of his danger but his apprehensions were soon dispelled by a friendly message from the leaders of those troops who expressed their inclination to desert the standard of the tyrant The honourable and lucrative rewards which they stipulated as the price of their perfidy were granted without hesitation and as ink and paper could not easily be procured the emperor subscribed on his own tablets the ratification of the treaty The spirit of his soldiers was revived by this seasonable reinforcement and they again marched with confidence to surprise the camp of a tyrant whose principal officers appeared to distrust either the justice or the success of his arms In the heat of the battle a violent tempest  Te propter gelidis Aquilo de monte procellis  Obruit adversas acies revolutaque tela  Vertit in auctores et turbine reppulit hastas  O nimium dilecte Deo cui fundit ab antris  Aeolus armatas hyemes cui militat Aether  Et conjurati veniunt ad classica venti  These famous lines of Claudian in iii Cons Honor c A D are alleged by his contemporaries Augustin and Orosius who suppress the Pagan deity of Aeolus and add some circumstances from the information of eyewitnesses Within four months after the victory it was compared by Ambrose to the miraculous victories of Moses and Joshua  such as is often felt  among the Alps suddenly arose from the East The army of Theodosius was sheltered by their position from the impetuosity of the wind which blew a cloud of dust in the faces of the enemy disordered their ranks wrested their weapons from their hands and diverted or repelled their ineffectual javelins This accidental advantage was skilfully improved the violence of the storm was magnified by the superstitious terrors of the Gauls and they yielded without shame to the invisible powers of heaven who seemed to militate on the side of the pious emperor His victory was decisive and the deaths of his two rivals were distinguished only by the difference of their characters The rhetorician Eugenius who had almost acquired the dominion of the world was reduced to implore the mercy of the conqueror and the unrelenting soldiers separated his head from his body as he lay prostrate at the feet of Theodosius Arbogastes after the loss of a battle in which he had discharged the duties of a soldier and a general wandered several days among the mountains But when he was convinced that his cause was desperate and his escape impracticable the intrepid Barbarian imitated the example of the ancient Romans and  turned his sword against his own breast The fate of the empire was determined in a narrow corner of Italy and the legitimate successor of the house of Valentinian embraced the archbishop of Milan and graciously received the submission of the provinces of the West Those provinces were involved in the guilt of rebellion while the inflexible courage of Ambrose alone had resisted the claims of successful usurpation With a manly freedom which might have been fatal to any other subject the archbishop rejected the gifts of Eugenius declined his correspondence and withdrew himself from Milan to avoid the odious presence of a tyrant whose downfal he predicted in disoreet and ambiguous language The merit of Ambrose was applauded by the conqueror who secured the attachment of the people by his alliance with the church and the clemency of Theodosius is ascribed to the humane intercession of the archbishop of Milan  The events of this

extend the prospect of the public felicity His  death only four months after his victory was considered by the people as an unforeseen and fatal event which destroyed in a moment the hopes of the rising generation But the indulgence of ease and luxury had secretly nourished the principles of disease  This disease ascribed by Socrates l v c to the fatigues of war is represented by Philostorgius

the palace to the camp and the increasing symptoms of a dropsy announced the speedy dissolution of the emperor The opinion and perhaps the interest of the public had confirmed the division of the Eastern and Western empires and the two royal youths Arcadius and Honorius who had already obtained from the tenderness of their father the title of Augustus were destined to fill the thrones of Constantinople and of Rome Those princes were not permitted to share the danger and glory of the civil war  Zosimus supposes that the boy Honorius accompanied his father l iv p Yet the quanto flagrabant pectora voto is all that flattery would allow to a contemporary poet who clearly describes the emperor's refusal and the journey of Honorius  after  the victory Claudian in iii Cons  but as soon as Theodosius had triumphed over his unworthy rivals he called his younger son Honorius to enjoy the fruits of the victory and to receive the sceptre of the West from the hands of his dying father The arrival of Honorius at Milan was welcomed by a splendid exhibition of the games of the Circus  and the emperor through he was oppressed by the weight of his disorder contributed by his presence to the public joy But the remains of his strength were exhausted by the painful effort which he made to assist at the spectacles of the morning Honorius supplied during the rest of the day the place of his father and the great Theodosius expired in the ensuing night Notwithstanding the recent animosities of a civil war his death was universally lamented The Barbarians whom he had vanquished and the churchmen by whom he had been subdued celebrated with loud and sincere applause the qualities of the deceased emperor which appeared the most valuable in their eyes The Romans were terrified by the impending dangers of a feeble and divided administration and every disgraceful moment of the unfortunate reigns of Arcadius and Honorius revived the memory of their irreparable loss  In the faithful picture of the virtues of Theodosius  Corruption of the times  his imperfections have not been dissembled the act of cruelty and the habits of indolence which tarnished the glory of one of the greatest of the Roman princes An historian perpetually adverse to the fame of Theodosius has exaggerated his vices and their pernicious effects he boldly asserts that every rank of subjects imitated the effeminate manners of their sovereign that every species of corruption polluted the course of public and private life and that the feeble restraints of order and decency were insufficient to resist the progress of that degenerate  spirit which sacrifices without a blush the consideration of duty and interest to the base indulgence of sloth and appetite  Zosimus l iv p  The complaints of contemporary writers who deplore the increase of luxury and depravation of manners are commonly expressive of their peculiar temper and situation There are few observers who possess a clear and comprehensive view of the revolutions of society and who are capable of discovering the nice and secret springs of action which impel in the same uniform direction the blind and capricious passions of a multitude of individuals If it can be affirmed with any degree of truth that the luxury of the Romans was more shameless and dissolute in the reign of Theodosius than in the age of Constantine perhaps or of Augustus the alteration cannot be ascribed to any beneficial improvements which had gradually increased the stock of national riches A long period of calamity or decay must have checked the industry and diminished the wealth of the people and their profuse luxury must have been the result of that indolent despair which enjoys the present hour and declines the thoughts of futurity The uncertain condition of their property discouraged the subjects of Theodosius from engaging in those useful and laborious undertakings which require an immediate expence and promise a slow and distant advantage The frequent examples of ruin and desolation tempted them not to spare the remains  of a patrimony which might every hour become the prey of the rapacious Goth And the mad prodigality which prevails in the confusion of a shipwreck or a siege may serve to explain the progress of luxury amidst the misfortunes and terrors of a sinking nation  The effeminate luxury which infected the  The infantry lay aside their armour  manners of courts and cities had instilled a secret and destructive poison into the camps of the legions and their degeneracy has been marked by the pen of a military writer who had accurately studied the genuine and ancient principles of Roman discipline It is the just and important observation of Vegetius that the infantry was invariably covered with defensive armour from the foundation of the city to the reign of the emperor Gratian The relaxation of discipline and the disuse of exercise rendered the soldiers less able and less willing to support the fatigues of the service they complained of the weight of the armour which they seldom wore and they successively obtained the permission of laying aside both their cuirasses and their helmets The heavy weapons of their ancestors the short sword and the formidable  pilum  which had subdued the world insensibly dropped from their feeble hands As the use of the shield is incompatible with that of the bow they reluctantly marched into the field condemned to suffer either the pain of wounds or the ignominy of flight and always disposed to prefer the more shameful alternative The cavalry of the Goths the Huns and the Alani had felt the benefits and adopted the use  of defensive armour and as they excelled in the management of missile weapons they easily overwhelmed the naked and trembling legions whose heads and breasts were exposed without defence to the arrows of the Barbarians The loss of armies the destruction of cities and the dishonour of the Roman name ineffectually solicited the successors of Gratian to restore the helmets and cuirasses of the infantry The enervated soldiers abandoned their own and the public defence and their pusillanimous indolence may be considered as the immediate cause of the downfal of the empire  Vegetius de Re Militari l i c The series of calamities which he marks compel us to believe that the  Hero  to whom he dedicates his book is the last

Theodosius is perhaps the only example of the total extirpation of any ancient and popular superstition  The destruction of the Pagan religion A D  and may therefore deserve to be considered as a singular event in the history of the human mind The Christians more especially the clergy had impatiently supported the prudent delays of Constantine and the equal toleration of the elder Valentinian nor could they deem their conquest perfect or secure as long as their adversaries were permitted to exist The influence which Ambrose and his brethren had acquired over the youth of Gratian and the piety of Theodosius was employed to infuse the maxims of persecution into the breasts of their Imperial proselytes Two specious principles of religious jurisprudence were established from whence they deduced a direct and rigorous conclusion against the subjects of the empire who still adhered to the ceremonies of their ancestors  that  the magistrate is in some measure guilty of the crimes which he neglects to prohibit or to punish and  that  the idolatrous worship of fabulous deities and real daemons is the most abominable crime against the supreme majesty of the Creator The laws of Moses

Roman priests had formerly obtained in the counsels of the republic was gradually abolished by the establishment of monarchy and the removal of  the seat of empire But the dignity of their sacred character was still protected by the laws and manners of their country and they still continued more especially the college of pontiffs to exercise in the capital and sometimes in the provinces the rights of their ecclesiastical and civil jurisdiction Their robes of purple chariots of state and sumptuous entertainments attracted the admiration of the people and they received from the consecrated lands and the public revenue an ample stipend which liberally supported the splendour of the priesthood and all the expences of the religious worship of the state As the service of the altar was not

ancient monument was the only injury which Constantius had offered to the superstition of the Romans The altar of Victory was again restored by Julian tolerated by Valentinian and once more banished from the senate by the zeal of Gratian  These facts are mutually allowed by the two advocates Symmachus and Ambrose  But the emperor yet  spared the statues of the gods which were exposed to the public veneration four hundred and twentyfour temples or chapels still remained to satisfy the devotion of the people and in every quarter of Rome the delicacy of the Christians was offended by the

grievances of the priesthood and the senate and to solicit the restoration of the altar of Victory The conduct of this important business was entrusted to the eloquent Symmachus  Symmachus who was invested with all the civil and sacerdotal honours represented the emperor under the two characters of  Pontifex Maximus  and  Princeps Senatûs  See the proud inscription at the head of his works  a wealthy and  noble senator who united the sacred characters of pontiff and augur with the civil dignities of proconsul of Africa and praefect of the city The breast of Symmachus was animated by the warmest zeal for the cause of expiring Paganism and his religious antagonists lamented the abuse of his genius and the inefficacy of his moral virtues  As if any one says Prudentius in Symmach i should dig in the mud with an instrument of gold and ivory Even saints and polemic saints treat this adversary with respect and civility  The orator whose petition is extant to the emperor Valentinian was conscious of the difficulty and danger of the office which he had assumed He cautiously avoids every topic which might appear to reflect on the religion of his sovereign humbly declares that prayers and entreaties are his only arms and artfully draws his arguments from the schools of rhetoric rather than from those of philosophy Symmachus endeavours to seduce the imagination of a young prince by displaying the attributes of the goddess of victory he insinuates that the confiscation of the revenues which were consecrated to the service of the gods was a measure unworthy of his liberal and disinterested character and he maintains that the Roman sacrifices would be deprived of their force and energy if they were no longer celebrated at the expence as well as in the name of the republic Even scepticism is made to supply an apology for superstition The great and incomprehensible  secret  of the universe eludes the enquiry of man Where reason cannot instruct custom may be permitted to guide and every nation seems to consult the dictates of prudence by a faithful attachment to those rites and opinions which have received the sanction of ages If those ages have been crowned with glory and prosperity if the devout people has frequently obtained the blessings which they have solicited at the altars of the gods it must appear still more advisable to persist in the same salutary practice and not to risk the unknown perils that may attend any rash innovations The test of antiquity and success was applied with singular advantage to the religion of Numa and ROME herself the caelestial genius that presided over the fates of the city is introduced by the orator to plead her own cause before the tribunal of the emperors  "Most excellent princes" says the venerable matron "fathers of your country pity and respect my age which has hitherto flowed in an uninterrupted course of piety Since I do not repent permit me to continue in the practice of my ancient rites Since I am born free allow me to enjoy my domestic institutions This religion has reduced the world under my laws These rites have repelled Hannibal from the city and the Gauls from the capitol Were my gray hairs reserved for such intolerable disgrace I am ignorant of the new system that I am required to adopt but I am well assured that the correction of old age is always an ungrateful  and ignominious office  See the fiftyfourth epistle of the tenth book of Symmachus In the form and disposition of his ten books of epistles he imitated the younger Pliny whose rich and florid style he was supposed by his friends to equal or excel Macrob Saturnal l v c But the luxuriancy of Symmachus consists of barren leaves without fruits and even without flowers Few facts and few sentiments can be extracted from his verbose correspondence  "  The fears of the people supplied what the discretion of the orator had suppressed and the calamities which afflicted or threatened the declining empire were unanimously imputed by the Pagans to the new religion of Christ and of Constantine  But the hopes of Symmachus were repeatedly  Conversion of Rome A D c  baffled by the firm and dexterous opposition of the archbishop of Milan who fortified the emperors against the fallacious eloquence of the advocate of Rome In this controversy Ambrose condescends to speak the language of a philosopher and to ask with some contempt why it should be thought necessary to introduce an imaginary and invisible power as the cause of those victories which were sufficiently explained by the valour and discipline of the legions He justly derides the absurd reverence for antiquity which could only tend to discourage the improvements of art and to replunge the human race into their original barbarism From thence gradually rising to a more lofty and theological tone he pronounces that Christianity alone is the doctrine of truth and salvation and that every mode of Polytheism conducts its deluded votaries through the paths of error to the abyss of eternal perdition  See Ambrose tom ii epist xvii xviii p The former of these epistles is a short caution the latter is a formal reply to the petition or  libel  of Symmachus The same ideas are more copiously expressed in the poetry if it may deserve that name of Prudentius who composed his two books against Symmachus A D while that senator was still alive It is whimsical enough that Montesquieu Considerations c c xix tom iii p should overlook the two professed antagonists of Symmachus and amuse himself with descanting on the more remote and indirect confutations of Orosius St Augustin and Salvian    Arguments like these when they were suggested by a favourite bishop had power to prevent the restoration of the altar of Victory but the same arguments fell with much more energy and effect from the mouth of a conqueror and the gods of antiquity were dragged in triumph at the chariotwheels of Theodosius  See Prudentius in Symmach l i c The Christian agrees with the Pagan Zosimus l iv p in placing this visit of Theodosius after the  second  civil war gemini bis victor caede Tyranni l i But the time and circumstances are better suited to his first triumph  In a full meeting of the senate the emperor proposed according to the forms of the republic the important question Whether the worship of Jupiter or that of Christ should be the religion of the Romans The liberty of suffrages which he affected to allow was destroyed by the hopes and fears that his presence inspired and the arbitrary exile of Symmachus was a recent admonition that it might be dangerous to oppose the wishes of the monarch On a regular division of the senate Jupiter was condemned and degraded by the sense of a very large majority and it is rather surprising that any members should be found bold enough to declare  by their speeches and votes that they were still attached to the interest of an abdicated deity  Prudentius after proving that the sense of the senate is declared by a legal majority proceeds to say c  Adspice quam pleno subsellia nostra Senatû  Decernant infame Jovis pulvinar et omne  Idolium longe purgatâ ab urbe fugandum  Qua vocat egregii sententia Principis illuc  Libera cum pedibus tum corde frequentia transit  Zosimus ascribes to the conscript fathers an heathenish courage which few of them are found to possess  The hasty conversion of the senate must be attributed either to supernatural or to sordid motives and many of these reluctant proselytes betrayed on every favourable occasion their secret disposition to throw aside the mask of odious dissimulation But they were gradually fixed in the new religion as the cause of the ancient became more hopeless they yielded to the authority of the emperor to the fashion of the times and to the entreaties of their wives and children  Jerom specifies the pontiff Albinus who was surrounded with such a believing family of children and grandchildren as would have been sufficient to convert even Jupiter himself an extraordinary proselyte tom i ad Laetam p  who who were instigated and governed by the clergy of Rome and the monks of the East  The edifying example of the Anician family was soon imitated by the rest of the nobility the Bassi the Paullini the Gracchi embraced the Christian religion and "the luminaries of the world the venerable assembly of Catos such are the highflown expressions of Prudentius were impatient to strip themselves of their pontifical garment to cast the skin of the old serpent to assume  the snowy robes of baptismal innocence and to humble the pride of the consular fasces before the tombs of the martyrs  Exsultare Patres videas pulcherrima mundi  Lumina conciliumque senûm gestire Catonum  Candidiore togâ niveum pietatis amictum  Sumere

liberality filled the churches of the Lateran and Vatican with an incessant throng of devout proselytes The decrees of the senate which proscribed the worship of idols were ratified by the general consent of the Romans  Prudentius after he has described the conversion of the senate and people asks with some truth and confidence  Et dubitamus adhuc Romam tibi Christe dicatam  In leges transîsse

glory but for the safety of the republic he ventured to offend a considerable party of his subjects by some acts which might perhaps secure the protection of Heaven but which must seem rash and unseasonable in the eye of human prudence The success of his first experiments against the Pagans encouraged the pious emperor to reiterate and enforce his edicts of proscription the same laws which had been originally published in the provinces of the East were applied after the defeat of Maximus to the whole extent of the Western empire and every victory of the orthodox Theodosius contributed to the triumph of the Christian and Catholic faith  See his laws in the Theodosian Code l xvi tit x leg  He attacked superstition in her most vital part by prohibiting the use of sacrifices which he

subsequent explanation tended to involve in the  same guilt the general practice of  immolation  which essentially constituted the religion of the Pagans As the temples had been erected for the purpose of sacrifice it was the duty of a benevolent prince to remove from his subjects the dangerous temptation of offending against the laws which he had enacted A special commission was granted to Cynegius the Praetorian praefect of the East and afterwards to the counts Jovius and Gaudentius two officers of distinguished rank in the West by which they were directed to shut the temples to seize or destroy the instruments of idolatry to abolish the privileges of the priests and to confiscate the consecrated property for the benefit of the emperor of the church or of the army  Zosimus l iv p Theodoret l v c Idatius in Chron Prosper Aquitan l iii c apud Baronium Annal Eccles A D No Libanius pro Templis p labours to prove that the commands of Theodosius were not direct and positive  Here the desolation might have stopped and the naked edifices which were no longer employed in the service of idolatry might have been protected from the destructive rage of fanaticism Many of those temples were the most splendid and beautiful monuments of Grecian architecture and the emperor himself was interested not to deface the splendour of his own cities or to diminish the value of his own possessions Those stately edifices might be suffered to remain as so many lasting trophies of the victory of Christ In the decline of the arts they might be usefully converted into magazines manufactures  or places of public assembly and perhaps when the walls of the temple had been sufficiently purified by holy rites the worship of the true Deity might be allowed to expiate the ancient guilt of idolatry But as long as they subsisted the Pagans fondly cherished the secret hope that an auspicious revolution a second Julian might again restore the altars of the gods and the earnestness with which they addressed their unavailing prayers to the throne  Cod Theodos l xvi tit x leg There is room to believe that this temple of Edessa which Theodosius wished to save for civil uses was

Sozomen l vii c with Theodoret l v c Between them they relate the crusade and death of Marcellus  as he is stiled by Theodoret a bishop animated with apostolic fervour resolved to level with the

on each of the four sides the lofty roof was supported by fifteen massy columns sixteen feet in circumference and the large stones of which they were composed were firmly cemented with lead and iron The force of the strongest and sharpest tools had been tried without effect It was found necessary to undermine the foundations of the columns which fell down as soon as the temporary wooden props had been consumed with fire and the difficulties of the enterprise are described under the allegory of a black daemon who retarded though he could not defeat the operations of the Christian engineers Elated with victory Marcellus took the field in person against the powers of darkness a numerous troop of soldiers and gladiators marched under the episcopal banner and he successively attacked the villages and country temples of the diocese of Apamea Whenever any resistance or danger was apprehended the champion of the faith whose lameness would not allow him either to fight or fly placed himself at a convenient distance beyond the reach of darts But  this prudence was the occasion of his death he was surprised and slain by a body of exasperated rustics and the synod of the province pronounced without hesitation that the holy Marcellus had sacrificed his life in the cause of God In the support of this cause the monks who rushed with tumultuous fury from the desert distinguished themselves by their zeal and diligence They deserved the enmity of the Pagans and some of them might deserve the reproaches of avarice and intemperance of avarice which they gratified with holy plunder and of intemperance which they indulged at the expence of the people who foolishly admired their tattered garments loud psalmody and artificial paleness  Libanius pro Templis p He rails at

understood that it became a subject of dispute whether he represented the bright orb of day or the gloomy monarch of the subterraneous regions  Origo dei nondum nostris celebrata Aegyptiorum

and the insults which he offered to an ancient chapel of Bacchus convinced the Pagans that he meditated a more important and dangerous enterprise In the tumultuous capital of Egypt the slightest provocation was sufficient to inflame a civil war The votaries of Serapis whose strength and numbers were much inferior to those of their antagonists rose in arms at the instigation of the philosopher  Olympius  Lardner Heathen Testimonies vol iv p has alleged a beautiful passage from Suidas or rather from Damascius which shews the devout and virtuous Olympius not in the light of a warrior but of a prophet  who exhorted them to die in the defence of the altars of the gods These Pagan fanatics fortified themselves in the temple or rather fortress of Serapis repelled the besiegers by daring sallies and a resolute defence and by the inhuman cruelties which they exercised on their Christian prisoners obtained the last consolation of despair The efforts of the prudent magistrate were usefully exerted for the establishment of a truce till the answer of Theodosius should determine the fate of Serapis The two parties assembled without arms in the principal square and the Imperial rescript was publicly read But when a sentence of destruction against the idols of Alexandria was pronounced the Christians set up a shout of joy and exultation whilst the unfortunate Pagans whose fury had given way to consternation retired with hasty and silent steps and eluded by their flight or obscurity the resentment of their enemies Theophilus proceeded to demolish the temple of Serapis without any other difficulties than those which he found in the weight and solidity of the materials but these objects proved so insuperable that he was obliged to leave the foundations and to content himself with reducing the edifice itself to a heap of rubbish a part of which was soon afterwards cleared away to make room for a church erected in honour of the Christian  martyrs The valuable library of Alexandria was pillaged or destroyed and near twenty years afterwards the appearance of the empty shelves excited the regret and indignation of every spectator whose mind was not totally

A great number of plates of different metals artificially joined together composed the majestic figure of the Deity who touched on either side the walls of the sanctuary The aspect of Serapis his sitting posture and the sceptre which he bore in his left hand were extremely similar to the ordinary representations of Jupiter He was distinguished from Jupiter by the basket or bushel which was placed on his head and by the emblematic monster which he hold in his right hand the head and body of a serpent branching into three tails which were again terminated by the triple heads of a dog a lion and a wolf It was confidently affirmed that if any impious hand should dare to violate the majesty of the god the heavens and the earth would instantly  return to their original chaos An intrepid soldier animated by zeal and armed with a weighty battleaxe ascended the ladder and even the Christian multitude expected with some anxiety the event of the combat  Sed fortes tremuere manus motique

goddess"  Plin Hist Natur xxxiii  He aimed a vigorous stroke against the cheek of Serapis the cheek fell to the ground the thunder was still silent and both the heavens and the earth continued to preserve their accustomed order and tranquillity The victorious soldier repeated his blows the huge idol was overthrown and broken in pieces and the limbs of Serapis were ignominiously dragged through the streets of Alexandria His mangled carcase was burnt in the Amphitheatre amidst the shouts of the populace and many persons attributed their conversion to this discovery of the impotence of their tutelar deity The popular modes of religion that propose any visible and material objects of worship have the advantage of adapting and familiarising themselves to the senses of mankind but this advantage is counterbalanced by the various and inevitable accidents to which the faith of the idolater is exposed It is scarcely possible that in every disposition of mind he should preserve his implicit  reverence for the idols or the relics which the naked eye and the profane hand are unable to distinguish from the most common productions of art or nature and if in the hour of danger their secret and miraculous virtue does not operate for their own preservation he scorns the vain apologies of his priests and justly derides the object and the folly of his superstitious attachment  The History of the Reformation affords frequent examples of the sudden change from superstition to contempt  After the fall of Serapis some hopes were still entertained by the Pagans that the Nile would refuse his annual supply to the impious masters of Egypt and the extraordinary delay of the inundation seemed to announce the displeasure of the rivergod But this delay was soon compensated by the rapid swell of the waters They suddenly rose to such an unusual height as to comfort the discontented party with the pleasing expectation of a deluge till the peaceful river again subsided to the wellknown and fertilising level of sixteen cubits or about thirty English feet  Sozomen l vii c I have supplied the measure The same standard of the inundation and consequently of the cubit has uniformly subsisted since the time of Herodotus See Freret in the Mem de l'Academie des Inscriptions tom xvi p Greaves's Miscellaneous Works vol i p The Egyptian cubit is about twentytwo inches of the English measure    The temples of the Roman empire were deserted  The Pagan religion is prohibited A D  or destroyed but the ingenious superstition of the Pagans still attempted to elude the laws of Theodosius by which all sacrifices had  been severely prohibited The inhabitants of the country whose conduct was less exposed to the eye of malicious curiosity disguised their  religious  under the appearance of  convivial  meetings On the days of solemn festivals they assembled in great numbers under the spreading shade of some consecrated trees sheep and oxen were slaughtered and roasted and this rural entertainment was sanctified by the use of incense and by the hymns which were sung in honour of the gods But it was alleged that as no part of the animal was made a burntoffering as no altar was provided to receive the blood and as the previous oblation of salt cakes and the concluding ceremony of libations were carefully omitted these festal meetings did not involve the guests in the guilt or penalty of an illegal sacrifice  Libanius pro Templis p pleads their cause with gentle and insinuating rhetoric From the earliest age such feasts had enlivened the country and those of

History vol iv p censures with becoming asperity the style and sentiments of this intolerant law  This prohibitory law is expressed in  the most absolute and comprehensive terms  "It is our will and pleasure" says the emperor "that none of our subjects whether magistrates or private citizens however exalted or however humble may be their rank and condition shall presume in any city or in any place to worship an inanimate idol by the sacrifice of a guiltless victim"  The act of sacrificing and the practice of divination by the entrails of the victim are declared without any regard to the object of the enquiry a crime of hightreason against the state which can be expiated only by the death of the guilty The rites of Pagan superstition which might seem less bloody and atrocious are abolished as highly injurious to the truth and honour of religion luminaries garlands frankincense and libations of wine are specially enumerated and condemned and the harmless claims of the domestic genius of the household gods are included in this rigorous proscription The use of any of these profane and illegal ceremonies subjects the offender to the forfeiture of the house or estate where they have been performed and if he has artfully chosen the property of another for the scene of his impiety he is compelled to discharge without delay a heavy fine of twentyfive pounds of gold or more than one thousand pounds sterling A fine not less considerable is imposed on the connivance of the secret enemies of religion who shall neglect the duty of their respective stations either to reveal or to punish the guilt of idolatry Such was the persecuting spirit of the laws of  Theodosius which were repeatedly enforced by his sons and grandsons with the loud and unanimous applause of the Christian world  Such a charge should not be lightly made but it may surely be justified by the authority of St Augustin who thus addresses the Donatists  "Quis nostrûm quis vestrûm non laudat leges ab Imperatoribus datas adversus sacrificia Paganorum Et certe longe ibi poena severior constituta est illius quippe impietatis capitale supplicium est"  Epist xciii No quoted by Le Clerc Bibliotheque Choisie tom viii p who adds some judicious reflections on the intolerance of the victorious Christians    In the cruel reigns of Decius and Diocletian  oppressed  Christianity had been proscribed as a revolt from the ancient and hereditary religion of the empire and the unjust suspicions which were entertained of a dark and dangerous faction were in some measure countenanced by the inseparable union and rapid conquests of the Catholic church But the same excuses of fear and ignorance cannot be applied to the Christian emperors who violated the precepts of humanity and of the gospel The experience of ages had betrayed the weakness as well as folly of Paganism the light of reason and of faith had already exposed to the greatest part of mankind the vanity of idols and the declining sect which still adhered to their worship might have been permitted to enjoy in peace and obscurity the religious customs of their ancestors Had the Pagans been animated by the undaunted zeal which possessed the minds of the primitive believers the triumph of the church must have been stained with blood and the martyrs of Jupiter and Apollo might have embraced the glorious opportunity of devoting their  lives and fortunes at the foot of their altars But such obstinate zeal was not congenial to the loose and careless temper of polytheism The violent and repeated strokes of the orthodox princes were broken by the soft and yielding substance against which they were directed and the ready obedience of the Pagans protected them from the pains and penalties of the Theodosian Code  Orosius l vii c p Augustin Enarrat in Psalm cxl apud Lardner Heathen Testimonies vol iv p insults their cowardice  "Quis eorum comprehensus est in sacrificio cum his legibus ista prohiberentur et non negavit"  Instead of asserting that the authority of the gods was superior to that of the emperor they desisted with a plaintive murmur from the use of those sacred rites which their sovereign had condemned If they were sometimes tempted by a sally of passion or by the hopes of concealment to indulge their favourite superstition their humble repentance disarmed the severity of the Christian magistrate and they seldom refused to atone for their rashness by submitting with some secret reluctance to the yoke of the Gospel The churches were filled with the increasing multitude of these unworthy proselytes who had conformed from temporal motives to the reigning religion and whilst they devoutly imitated the postures and recited the prayers of the faithful they satisfied their conscience by the silent and sincere invocation of the gods of antiquity  Libanius pro Templis p mentions without censure the occasional conformity and as it were theatrical play of these hypocrites  If the Pagans wanted patience to suffer they wanted  spirit to resist and the scattered myriads who deplored the ruin of the temples yielded without a contest to the fortune of their adversaries The disorderly opposition  Libanius concludes his apology p by declaring to the emperor that unless he expressly warrants the destruction of the temples  the proprietors will defend themselves and the laws  of the peasants of Syria and the populace of Alexandria to the rage of private fanaticism was silenced by the name and authority of the emperor The Pagans of the West without contributing to the elevation of Eugenius disgraced by their partial attachment the cause and character of the usurper The clergy vehemently exclaimed that he aggravated the crime of rebellion by the guilt of apostacy that by his permission the altar of Victory was again restored and that the idolatrous symbols of Jupiter and Hercules were displayed in the field against the invincible standard of the cross But the vain hopes of the Pagans were soon annihilated by the defeat of Eugenius and they were left exposed to the resentment of the conqueror who laboured to deserve the favour of heaven by the extirpation

of Christianity was not made an essential qualification for the enjoyment of the civil rights of society nor were any peculiar hardships imposed on the sectaries who credulously received the fables of Ovid and obstinately rejected the miracles of the Gospel The palace the schools the army and the senate were filled with declared and devout Pagans they obtained without distinction the civil and military honours of the empire Theodosius distinguished his liberal regard for virtue and genius by the consular dignity which he bestowed on Symmachus  Denique pro meritis terrestribus aeque

Libanius pro Templis p is proud that Theodosius should thus distinguish a man who even in his  presence  would swear by Jupiter Yet this presence seems to be no more than a figure of rhetoric  and the two eloquent apologists of Paganism were never required either to change or to dissemble their religious opinions The Pagans were indulged in the most licentious freedom of speech and writing the  historical and philosophic remains of Eunapius Zosimus  Zosimus who styles himself Count and Exadvocate of the Treasury reviles with partial and indecent bigotry the Christian princes and even the father of his sovereign His work must have been privately circulated since it escaped the invectives of the ecclesiastical historians prior to Evagrius l iii c who lived towards the end of the sixth century  and the fanatic teachers of the school of Plato betray the most furious animosity and contain the sharpest invectives against the sentiments and conduct of their victorious adversaries If these audacious libels were publicly known we must applaud the good sense of the Christian princes who viewed with a smile of contempt the last struggles of superstition and despair  Yet the Pagans of Africa complained that the times would not allow them to answer with freedom the City of God nor does St Augustin v deny the charge  But the Imperial laws which prohibited the sacrifices and ceremonies of Paganism were rigidly executed and every hour contributed to destroy the influence of a religion which was supported by custom rather than by argument The devotion of the poet or the philosopher may be secretly nourished by prayer meditation and study but the exercise of public worship appears to be the only solid foundation of the religious sentiments of the people which derive their force from imitation and habit The interruption of that public exercise may consummate in the period of a few years the important work of a national revolution The memory of theological opinions cannot long be preserved without the artificial helps of priests of temples and of  books  The Moors of Spain who secretly preserved the Mahometan religion above a century under the tyranny of the Inquisition possessed the Koran with the peculiar use of the Arabic tongue See the curious and honest story of their expulsion in Geddes Miscellanies vol i p  The ignorant vulgar whose minds are still agitated by the blind hopes and terrors of superstition will be soon persuaded by their superiors to direct their vows to the reigning deities of the age and will insensibly imbibe an ardent zeal for the support and propagation of the new doctrine which spiritual hunger at first compelled them to accept The generation that arose in the world after the promulgation of the Imperial laws was attracted within the pale of the Catholic church and so rapid yet so gentle was the fall of Paganism that only twentyeight years after the death of Theodosius the faint and minute vestiges were no longer visible to the eye of the legislator  Paganos qui supersunt quanquam jam nullos esse credamus c Cod Theodos l xvi tit x leg A D The younger Theodosius was afterwards satisfied that his judgment had been somewhat premature    The ruin of the Pagan religion is described by  The worship of the Christian martyrs  the sophists as a dreadful and amazing prodigy which covered the earth with darkness and restored the ancient dominion of chaos and of night They relate in solemn and pathetic strains that the temples were converted into sepulchres and that the holy places which had been adorned by the statues of the gods were basely polluted by the relics of Christian martyrs  "The monks" a race of filthy animals to whom Eunapius is  tempted to refuse the name of men "are the authors of the new worship which in the place of those deities who are conceived by the understanding has substituted the meanest and most contemptible slaves The heads salted and pickled of those infamous malefactors who for the multitude of their crimes have suffered a just and ignominious death their bodies still marked by the impression of the lash and the scars of those tortures which were inflicted by the sentence of the magistrate such"  continues Eunapius  "are the gods which the earth produces in our days such are the martyrs the supreme arbitrators of our prayers and petitions to the Deity whose tombs are now consecrated as the objects of the veneration of the people  See Eunapius in his life of the sophist Aedesius in that of Eustathius he foretels the ruin of Paganism    "  Without approving the malice it is natural enough to share the surprise of the Sophist the spectator of a revolution which raised those obscure victims of the laws of Rome to the rank of celestial and invisible protectors of the Roman empire The grateful respect of the Christians for the martyrs of the faith was exalted by time and victory into religious adoration and the most illustrious of the saints and prophets were deservedly associated to the honours of the martyrs One hundred and fifty years after the glorious deaths of St Peter and St Paul the Vatican and the Ostian road were distinguished by the tombs or rather by the trophies of those  spiritual heroes  Caius apud Euseb Hist Eccles l ii c a Roman presbyter who lived in the time of Zephyrinus A D is an early witness of

the church Without much regard for truth or probability they invented names for skeletons and actions for names The fame of the apostles and of the holy men who had imitated their virtues was darkened by religious fiction To the invincible band of genuine and primitive martyrs they added myriads of imaginary heroes who had never existed except in the fancy of crafty or credulous legendaries and there is reason to suspect that Tours might not be the only diocese in which the bones of a malefactor were adored instead of those of a saint  Martin of Tours See his Life c by Sulpicius Severus extorted this confession from the mouth of the dead man The error is allowed to be natural the discovery is supposed to be miraculous Which of the two was likely to happen most frequently  A

superstition would have  II Miracles  been much less rapid and victorious if the faith  of the people had not been assisted by the seasonable aid of visions and miracles to ascertain the authenticity and virtue of the most suspicious relics In the reign of the younger Theodosius Lucian  Lucian composed in Greek his original narrative which has been translated by Avitus and published by Baronius

and inconsistent The most incredible parts of the legend are smoothed and softened by Tillemont Mem Eccles tom ii p c  a presbyter of Jerusalem and the ecclesiastical minister of the village of Caphargamala about twenty miles from the city related a very singular dream which to remove his doubts had been repeated on three successive Saturdays A venerable figure stood before him in the silence of the night with a long beard a white robe and a gold rod announced himself by the name of Gamaliel and revealed to the astonished presbyter that his own corpse with the bodies of his son Abibas his friend Nicodemus and the illustrious Stephen the first martyr of the Christian faith were secretly buried in the adjacent field He added with some impatience that it was time to release himself and his companions from their obscure prison that their appearance would be salutary to a distressed world and that they had made choice of Lucian to inform the bishop of Jerusalem of their situation and their wishes The doubts and difficulties which still retarded this important discovery were successively removed by new visions and the ground  was opened by the bishop in the presence of an innumerable multitude The coffins of Gamaliel of his son and of his friend were found in regular order but when the fourth coffin which contained the remains of Stephen was shewn to the light the earth trembled and an odour such as that of paradise was smelt which instantly cured the various diseases of seventythree of the assistants The companions of Stephen were left in their peaceful residence of Caphargamala but the relics of the first martyr were transported in solemn procession to a church constructed in their honour on Mount Sion and the minute particles of those relics a drop

inserted in the elaborate work of the City of God which the bishop of Hippo designed as a solid and immortal proof of the truth of Christianity Augustin solemnly declares that  he has selected those miracles only which were publicly certified by the persons who were either the objects or the spectators of the power of the martyr Many prodigies were omitted or forgotten and Hippo had been less favourably treated than the other cities of the province And yet the bishop enumerates above seventy miracles of which three were resurrections from the dead in the space of two years and within the limits of his own diocese  See Augustin de Civitat Dei l xxii c and the Appendix which contains two books of St Stephen's miracles by Evodius bishop of Uzalis  Freculphus apud Basnage Hist des Juifs tom viii p has preserved a Gallic or Spanish proverb "Whoever pretends to have read all the miracles of St Stephen he lies"  If we enlarge our view to all the dioceses and all the saints of the Christian world it will not be easy to calculate the fables and the errors which issued from this inexhaustible source But we may surely be allowed to observe that a miracle in that age of superstition and credulity lost its name and its merit since it could scarcely be considered as a deviation from the ordinary and established laws of nature  III The innumerable miracles of which the tombs of the martyrs were the perpetual theatre  III Revival of Polytheism  revealed to the pious believer the actual state and constitution of the invisible world and his religious speculations appeared to be founded on the firm basis of fact and experience Whatever might be the condition of vulgar souls in the long interval between the dissolution and the resurrection of their bodies it was

Fathers as far as they assert the sleep or repose of human souls till the day of judgment He afterwards exposes p c the inconveniencies which must arise if they possessed a more active and sensible existence  It was evident without presuming to determine the place of their habitation or the nature of their felicity that they enjoyed the lively and active consciousness of their happiness their virtue and their powers and that they had already secured the possession of their eternal reward The enlargement of their intellectual faculties surpassed the measure of the human imagination since it was proved by  experience  that they were capable of hearing and understanding the various petitions of their numerous votaries who in the same moment of time but in the most distant parts of the world invoked the name and assistance of Stephen or of Martin  Vigilantius placed the souls of the prophets and martyrs either in the bosom of Abraham in loco refrigerii or else under the altar of God

of the Catholic church and that the individuals who imitated the example of their  faith and piety were the peculiar and favourite objects of their most tender regard Sometimes indeed their friendship might be influenced by considerations of a less exalted kind they viewed with partial affection the places which had been consecrated by their birth their residence their death their burial or the possession of their relics The meaner passions of pride avarice and revenge may be deemed unworthy of a celestial breast yet the saints themselves condescended to testify their grateful approbation of the liberality of their votaries and the sharpest bolts of punishment were hurled against those impious wretches who violated their magnificent shrines or disbelieved their supernatural power  Fleury Discours sur l'Hist Ecclesiastique iii p  Atrocious indeed must have been the guilt and strange would have been the scepticism of those men if they had obstinately resisted the proofs of a divine agency which the elements the whole range of the animal creation and even the subtle and invisible operations of the human mind were compelled to obey  At Minorca the relics of St Stephen converted in eight days Jews with the help indeed of some wholesome severities such as burning the synagogue driving the obstinate infidels to starve among the rocks c See the original letter of Severus bishop of Minorca ad calcem St Augustin de Civ Dei and the judicious remarks of Basnage tom viii p  The immediate and almost instantaneous effects that were supposed to follow the prayer or the offence

continually obliged to intercede before the throne of grace or whether they might not be permitted to exercise according to the dictates of their benevolence and justice the delegated powers of their subordinate ministry The imagination which had been raised by a painful effort to the contemplation and worship of the Universal Cause eagerly embraced such inferior objects of adoration as were more proportioned to its gross conceptions and imperfect faculties The sublime and simple theology of the primitive Christians was gradually corrupted and the MONARCHY of heaven already clouded by metaphysical subtleties was degraded by the introduction of a popular mythology which tended to restore the reign of polytheism  Mr Hume Essays vol ii p observes like a philosopher the natural flux

worship of a Christian congregation As soon as the doors of the church were thrown open they must have been offended by the smoke of incense the perfume of flowers and the glare of lamps and tapers which diffused at noonday a gawdy superfluous and in their opinion a sacrilegious light If they approached the balustrade of the altar they made their way through the prostrate crowd consisting for the most part of strangers and pilgrims who resorted to the city on the vigil of the seast and who already felt the strong intoxication of fanaticism and perhaps of wine Their devout kisses were imprinted on the walls and pavement of the sacred edifice and their fervent prayers were directed whatever might be the language of their church to the bones the blood or the ashes of the saint which were usually concealed by a linen or silken veil from the eyes of the vulgar The Christians frequented the tombs of the martyrs in the hope of obtaining from their powerful intercession every sort of spiritual but more especially of temporal blessings They implored the preservation of their health or the cure of their infirmities  the fruitfulness of their barren wives or the safety and happiness of their children Whenever they undertook any distant or dangerous journey they requested that the holy martyrs would be their guides and protectors on the road and if they returned without having experienced any misfortune they again hastened to the tombs of the martyrs to celebrate with grateful thanksgivings their obligations to the memory and relics of those heavenly patrons The walls were hung round with symbols of the favours which they had received eyes and hands and feet of gold and silver and edifying pictures which could not long escape the abuse of indiscreet or idolatrous devotion represented the image the attributes and the miracles of the tutelar saint The same uniform original spirit of superstition might suggest in the most distant ages and countries the same methods of deceiving the credulity and of affecting the senses of mankind  The resemblance of superstition which could not be imitated might be traced from Japan to Mexico Warburton has seized this idea which he distorts by rendering it too general and absolute Divine Legation vol iv p c  but it must ingenuously be confessed that the ministers of the Catholic church imitated the profane model which they were impatient to destroy The most respectable bishops had persuaded themselves that the ignorant rustics would more cheerfully renounce the superstitions of Paganism if they found some resemblance some compensation in  the bosom of Christianity The religion of Constantine atchieved in less than a century the final conquest of the Roman empire but the victors themselves were insensibly subdued by the arts of their vanquished rivals  The imitation of Paganism is the subject of Dr Middleton's agreeable letter from Rome Warburton's animadversions obliged him to connect vol

soldiers and the people Arcadius who then was about eighteen years of age was born in Spain in the humble habitation of a private family But he received a princely education in the palace of Constantinople and his inglorious life was spent in that peaceful and splendid seat of royalty from whence he appeared to reign over the provinces of Thrace Asia Minor Syria and Egypt from the Lower Danube to the confines of Persia and Aethiopia His younger brother Honorius assumed in the eleventh year  of his age the nominal government of Italy Africa Gaul Spain and Britain and the troops which guarded the frontiers of his kingdom were opposed on one side to the Caledonians and on the other to the Moors The great and martial praefecture of Illyricum was divided between the two princes the defence and possession of the provinces of Noricum Pannonia and Dalmatia still belonged to the western empire but the two large dioceses of Dacia and Macedonia which Gratian had entrusted to the valour of Theodosius were for ever united to the empire of the East The boundary in Europe was not very different from the line which now separates the Germans and the Turks and the respective advantages of territory riches populousness and military strength were fairly balanced and compensated in this final and permanent division of the Roman empire The hereditary sceptre of the sons of Theodosius appeared to be the gift of nature and of their father the generals and ministers had been accustomed to adore the majesty of the royal infants and the army and people were not admonished of their rights and of their power by the dangerous example of a recent election The gradual discovery of the weakness of Arcadius and Honorius and the repeated calamities of their reign were not sufficient to obliterate the deep and early impressions of loyalty The subjects of Rome who still reverenced the persons or rather the names of their sovereigns beheld with equal abhorrence the rebels who opposed  and the ministers who abused the authority of the throne  Theodosius had tarnished the glory of his reign  Character and administration of Rufinus A D  by the elevation of Rufinus an

were subservient only to the passions of his master yet in the horrid massacre of Thessalonica the cruel Rufinus inflamed the fury without imitating the repentance of Theodosius The minister who viewed with proud indifference the rest of mankind never forgave the appearance of an injury and his personal enemies had forfeited in his opinion the merit of all public services Promotus the mastergeneral of the infantry had saved the empire from the invasion of the Ostrogoths but he indignantly supported the preeminence of a rival whose character and profession he despised and in the midst of a public council the impatient soldier was provoked to chastise with a blow the indecent pride of the favourite This act of violence was represented to the emperor as an insult which it was incumbent on  his  dignity to resent The disgrace and exile of Promotus were signified by a peremptory order to repair without delay to a military station on the banks of the Danube and the death of

laws and finances For the trial of these illustrious offenders the emperor constituted a special commission several judges were named to share the guilt and reproach of injustice but the right of pronouncing sentence was reserved to the president alone and that president was Rufinus himself The father stripped of the praefecture of the East was thrown into a dungeon but the son conscious that few ministers can be found innocent where an enemy is their judge had secretly escaped and Rufinus must have been satisfied with the least obnoxious victim if despotism had not condescended to employ the basest and most ungenerous artifice The prosecution was conducted with an appearance of equity and moderation which flattered Tatian with the hope of a favourable event his confidence was fortified by the solemn assurances and perfidious oaths of the president who presumed to interpose the sacred name of Theodosius himself and the unhappy father was at last persuaded to recal by a private letter the fugitive Proculus He was instantly seized examined condemned and beheaded in one of the suburbs of Constantinople with a precipitation which disappointed  the clemency of the emperor Without respecting the misfortunes of a consular senator the cruel judges of Tatian compelled him to behold the execution of his son the fatal cord was fastened round his own neck but in the moment when he expected and perhaps desired the relief of a speedy death he was permitted to consume the miserable remnant of his old age in poverty and exile  Juvenum rorantia colla  Ante patrum

exceptionable parts of their own conduct the enmity of Rufinus might be palliated by the jealous and unsociable nature of ambition But he indulged a spirit of revenge equally repugnant to prudence and to justice when he degraded their native country of Lycia from the rank of Roman provinces stigmatised a guiltless people with a mark of ignominy and declared that the countrymen of Tatian and Proculus should for ever remain incapable of holding any employment of honour or advantage under the Imperial government  This odious law is recited and repealed by Arcadius A D in the Theodosian Code

the most criminal pursuits from the performance of the religious duties which in that age were considered as the most essential to salvation In the suburb of Chalcedon surnamed the  Oak  he had built a magnificent villa to which he devoutly added a stately church consecrated to the apostles St Peter and St Paul and continually sanctified by the prayers and pennance of a regular society of monks A numerous and almost general synod of the bishops of the eastern empire was summoned to celebrate at the same time the dedication of the church and the baptism of the founder This double ceremony was performed with extraordinary pomp and when Rufinus was purified in the holy font from all the sins that he had hitherto committed a venerable hermit of Egypt rashly proposed himself as the sponsor of a proud and ambitious statesman  Ammonius Rufinum propriis manibus suscepit sacro fonte mundatum See Rosweyde's Vitae Patrum p Sozomen l viii c mentions the church and monastery and Tillemont Mem

of Arcadius a feeble youth whom the imperious praefect considered as his pupil rather than his sovereign Regardless of the public opinion he indulged his passions without remorse and without

the public discontent was sometimes appeased by the sacrifice of an unpopular criminal whose punishment was profitable only to the praefect of the East his accomplice and his judge If avarice were not the blindest of the human passions the motives of Rufinus might excite our curiosity and we might be tempted to inquire with what view he violated every principle of humanity and justice to accumulate those immense treasures which he could not spend without folly nor possess without danger Perhaps he vainly imagined that he laboured for the interest of an only daughter on whom he intended to bestow his royal pupil and the august rank of Empress of the East Perhaps he deceived himself by the opinion that his avarice was the instrument of his ambition He aspired to place his fortune on a secure and independent basis which should no longer depend on the caprice of the young emperor yet he neglected to conciliate the hearts of the soldiers and people by the liberal distribution of those riches which he had acquired with so much toil and with so much guilt The extreme parsimony of Rufinus left him only the reproach and envy of illgotten wealth his dependents served him without attachment the universal hatred of mankind was repressed only by the influence of servile fear The fate of  Lucian proclaimed to the East that the praefect whose industry was much abated in the dispatch of ordinary

inheritance the fruit of rapine and corruption to purchase the friendship of Rufinus and the high office of Count of the East But the new magistrate imprudently departed from the maxims of the court and of the times disgraced his benefactor by the contrast of a virtuous and temperate administration and presumed to refuse an act of injustice which might have tended to the profit of the emperor's uncle Arcadius was easily persuaded to resent the supposed insult and the praefect of the East resolved to execute in person the cruel vengeance which he meditated against this ungrateful delegate of his power He performed with incessant speed the journey of seven or eight hundred miles from Constantinople to Antioch entered the capital of Syria at the dead of night and spread universal consternation among a people ignorant of his design but not ignorant of his character The count of the fifteen provinces of the East was dragged like the vilest malefactor before the arbitrary tribunal of Rufinus Notwithstanding the clearest evidence of his integrity which was not impeached even by the voice of an accuser Lucian was condemned almost without a trial to suffer a cruel and ignominious punishment The ministers of the tyrant by the order and in the presence of their master beat  him on the neck with leather thongs armed at the extremities with lead and when he fainted under the violence of the pain he was removed in a close litter to conceal his dying agonies from the eyes of the indignant city No sooner had Rufinus perpetrated this inhuman act the sole object of his expedition than he returned amidst the deep and silent curses of a trembling people from Antioch to Constantinople and his diligence was accelerated by the hope of accomplishing without delay the nuptials of his daughter with the emperor of the East  Caetera segnis  Ad facinus velox penitus regione remotas  Impiger ire vias  This allusion of Claudian in Rufin i is again explained by the

by the strong though invisible chain of habit and that the merit and much more easily the favour of the absent are obliterated in a short time from the mind of a weak and capricious sovereign While the praefect satiated his revenge at Antioch a secret conspiracy of the favourite eunuchs directed by the great chamberlain Eutropius undermined his power in the palace of Constantinople They discovered that Arcadius was not inclined to love the daughter of Rufinus who had been chosen without his consent for his bride and they contrived to substitute in her place the fair Eudoxia the daughter of Bauto  Zosimus l iv p praises the valour prudence and integrity of Bauto the Frank See Tillemont Hist des Empereurs tom v p    a general of the Franks in the service of Rome and who was educated since the death of her father in the family of the sons of Promotus The young emperor whose chastity had been strictly guarded by the pious care of his tutor Arsenius  Arsenius escaped from the palace of Constantinople and passed fiftyfive years in rigid pennance in the monasteries of Egypt See Tillemont Mem Eccles tom xiv p and Fleury Hist Eccles tom v p c but the latter for want of authentic materials has given too much credit to the legend of Metaphrastes  eagerly listened to the artful and flattering descriptions of the charms of Eudoxia he gazed with impatient ardour on her picture and he understood the necessity of concealing his amorous designs from the knowledge of a minister who was so deeply interested to oppose the consummation of his happiness Soon after the return of Rufinus the approaching ceremony of the royal nuptials was announced to the people of Constantinople who prepared to celebrate with false and hollow acclamations the fortune of his daughter A splendid train of eunuchs and officers issued in hymeneal pomp from the gates of the palace bearing aloft the diadem the robes and the inestimable ornaments of the future empress The solemn procession passed through the streets of the city which were adorned with garlands and filled with spectators but when it reached the house of the sons of Promotus the principal eunuch respectfully entered the mansion invested the fair Eudoxia with the Imperial robes and conducted her in triumph to the palace and bed of Arcadius  This story Zosimus l v p proves that the hymeneal rites of antiquity were still practised without idolatry by the Christians of the East and the bride was  forcibly  conducted from the house of her parents to that of her husband Our form of marriage requires with less delicacy the express and public consent of a virgin  The secresy and success with which  this conspiracy against Rufinus had been conducted imprinted a mark of indelible ridicule on the character of a minister who had suffered himself to be deceived in a post where the arts of deceit and dissimulation constitute the most distinguished merit He considered with a mixture of indignation and fear the victory of an aspiring eunuch who had secretly captivated the favour of his sovereign and the disgrace of his daughter whose interest was inseparably connected with his own wounded the tenderness or at least the pride of Rufinus At the moment when he flattered himself that he should become the father of a line of kings a foreign maid who had been educated in the house of his implacable enemies was introduced into the Imperial bed and Eudoxia soon displayed a superiority of sense and spirit to improve the ascendant which her beauty must acquire over the mind of a fond and youthful husband The emperor would soon be instructed to hate to fear and to destroy the powerful subject whom he had injured and the consciousness of guilt deprived Rufinus of every hope either of safety or comfort in the retirement of a private life But he still possessed the most effectual means of defending his dignity and perhaps of oppressing his enemies The praefect still exercised an uncontrouled authority over the civil and military government of the East  and his treasures if he could resolve to use them might be employed to procure proper instruments for the execution of the blackest designs that pride ambition and revenge could suggest to a desperate statesman The character of Rufinus seemed to justify the accusations that he conspired against the person of his sovereign to seat himself on the vacant throne and that he had secretly invited the Huns and the Goths to invade the provinces of the empire and to increase the public confusion The subtle praefect whose life had been spent in the intrigues of the palace opposed with equal arms the artful measures of the eunuch Eutropius but the timid soul of Rufinus was astonished by the hostile approach of a more formidable rival of the great Stilicho the general or rather the master of the empire of the West  Zosimus l v p Orosius l vii c and the Chronicle of Marcellinus Claudian in Rufin ii paints in lively

worthy to celebrate the actions of heroes has been enjoyed by Stilicho in a much higher degree than might have been expected from the declining state of genius and of art The muse of Claudian  Stilicho directly or indirectly is the perpetual theme of Claudian The youth and private life of the hero are vaguely expressed in the poem on his first consulship  devoted to his service was always prepared to stigmatise his adversaries Rufinus or Eutropius with eternal infamy or to paint in the most splendid colours the victories and virtues of a powerful benefactor In the review of a period indifferently  supplied with authentic materials we cannot refuse to illustrate the annals of Honorius from the invectives or the panegyrics of a contemporary writer but as Claudian appears to have indulged the most ample privilege of a poet and a courtier some criticism will be requisite to translate the language of fiction or exaggeration into the truth and simplicity of historic prose His silence concerning the family of Stilicho may be admitted as a proof that his patron was neither able nor desirous to boast of a long series of illustrious progenitors and the slight mention of his father an officer of Barbarian cavalry in the service of Valens seems to countenance the assertion that the general who so long commanded the armies of Rome was descended from the savage and perfidious race of the Vandals  Vandalorum imbellis avarae perfidae et dolosae gentis genere editus Orosius l vii c Jerom tom i ad Gerontiam p calls him a SemiBarbarian  If Stilicho had not possessed the external advantages of strength and stature the most flattering bard in the presence of so many thousand spectators would have hesitated to affirm that he surpassed the measure of the demigods of antiquity and that whenever he moved with lofty steps through the streets of the capital the astonished crowd made room for the stranger who displayed in a private condition the awful majesty of a hero From his earliest youth he embraced the profession of arms his prudence and valour were soon distinguished in the field the horsemen and archers of the East admired his superior dexterity and  in each degree of his military promotions the public judgment always prevented and approved the choice of the sovereign He was named by Theodosius to ratify a solemn treaty with the monarch of Persia he supported during that important embassy the dignity of the Roman name and after his return to Constantinople his merit was rewarded by an intimate and honourable alliance with the Imperial family Theodosius had been prompted by a pious motive of fraternal affection to adopt for his own the daughter of his brother Honorius the beauty and accomplishments of Serena  Claudian in an imperfect poem has drawn a fair perhaps a flattering portrait of Serena That favourite niece of Theodosius was born as well as her sister Thermantia in Spain from whence in their earliest youth they were honourably conducted to the palace of Constantinople  were universally admired by the obsequious court and Stilicho obtained the preference over a crowd of rivals who ambitiously disputed the hand of the princess and the favour of her adoptive father  Some doubt may be entertained whether this adoption was legal or only metaphorical See Ducange Fam Byzant p An old inscription gives Stilicho the singular title of  Progener Divi Theodosii  The assurance that the husband of Serena would be faithful to the throne which he was permitted to approach engaged the emperor to exalt the fortunes and to employ the abilities of the sagacious and intrepid Stilicho He rose through the successive steps of master of the horse and count of the domestics to the supreme rank of mastergeneral of all the cavalry and infantry of  His military command  the Roman or at least of the Western empire  Claudian Laus Serenae expresses in poetic language the "dilectus equorum" and the "gemino mox idem culmine duxit agmina" The inscription adds "count of the domestics" an important command which Stilicho in the height of his grandeur might prudently retain  and his enemies confessed that he invariably disdained to barter for gold the rewards of merit or  A D  to defraud the soldiers of the pay and gratifications which they deserved or claimed from the liberality of the state  The beautiful lines of Claudian in i Cons Stilich ii display  his  genius but the integrity of Stilicho in the military administration is much more firmly established by the unwilling evidence of Zosimus l v p  The valour and conduct which he afterwards displayed in the defence of Italy against the arms of Alaric and Radagaisus may justify the fame of his early atchievements and in an age less attentive to the laws of honour or of pride the Roman generals might yield the preeminence of rank to the ascendant of superior genius  Si bellica moles  Ingrueret quamvis annis et jure minori  Cedere grandaevos equitum

rival and his friend and the massacre of many thousands of the flying Bastarnae is represented by the poet as a bloody sacrifice which the Roman Achilles offered to the manes of another Patroclus The virtues and victories of Stilicho deserved the hatred of Rufinus and the arts of calumny might  have been successful if the tender and vigilant Serena had not protected her husband against his domestic foes whilst he vanquished in the field the enemies of the empire  Compare the poem on the first consulship i with the  Laus Screnae  where it unfortunately breaks off We may perceive the deep inveterate malice of Rufinus  Theodosius continued to support an unworthy minister to whose diligence he delegated the government of the palace and of the East but when he marched against the tyrant Eugenius he associated his faithful general to the labours and glories of the civil war and in the last moments of his life the dying monarch recommended to Stilicho the care of his sons and of the republic  Quem  fratribus  ipse  Discedens clypeumque defensoremque dedisti  Yet the nomination iv Cons Hon was private iii Cons Hon cunctos discedere jubet and may therefore be suspected Zosimus and Suidas apply to Stilicho and Rufinus the same equal title of  guardians or procurators  The ambition and the abilities of Stilicho were not unequal to the important trust and he claimed the guardianship of the two empires during the minority of Arcadius and Honorius  The Roman law distinguishes two sorts of  minority  which expired at the age of fourteen and of twentyfive The one was subject to the  tutor  or guardian of the person the other to the  curator  or trustee of the estate Heineccius Antiquitat Rom ad Jurisprudent pertinent l i tit xxii xxiii p But these legal ideas were never accurately transferred into the constitution of an elective monarchy  The first measure of his administration or rather of his reign displayed to the nations the vigour and activity of a spirit worthy to command He passed the Alps in the depth of winter descended the stream of  the Rhine from the fortress of Basil to the marches of Batavia reviewed the state of the garrisons repressed the enterprises of the Germans and after establishing along the banks a firm and honourable peace returned with incredible speed to the palace of Milan  See Claudian i Cons Stilich i but he must allow more than fifteen days for the journey and return between Milan and Leyden  The person and court of Honorius were subject to the mastergeneral of the West and the armies and provinces of Europe obeyed

the standard of Theodosius The various multitudes of Europe and  Asia exasperated by recent animosities were overawed by the authority of a single man and the rigid discipline of Stilicho protected the lands of the citizen from the rapine of the licentious soldier  Tantoque remoto  Principe mutatas orbis non sensit habenas  This high commendation i Cons Stil i may be justified by the fears of

p Sozomen l viii c Socrates l vi c Philostorgius l xi c with Godefroy p and the Chronicle of Marcellinus  The guilty soul of Rufinus was alarmed by the approach of a warrior and a rival whose enmity he deserved he computed with increasing terror the narrow space of his life and greatness and as the last hope of safety he interposed the authority of the emperor Arcadius Stilicho who appears to have directed his march along the sea coast of the Hadriatic was not far distant from the city of Thessalonica when he received a peremptory message to recal the troops of the East and to declare that  his  nearer approach would be considered by the Byzantine  court as an act of hostility The prompt and unexpected obedience of the general of the West convinced the vulgar of his loyalty and moderation and as he had already engaged the affection of the Eastern troops he recommended to their zeal the execution of his bloody design which might be accomplished in his absence with less danger perhaps and with less reproach Stilicho left the command of the troops of the East to Gainas the Goth on whose fidelity he firmly relied with an assurance at least that the hardy Barbarian would never be diverted from his purpose by any consideration of fear or remorse The soldiers were easily persuaded to punish the enemy of Stilicho and of Rome and such was the general hatred which Rufinus had excited that the fatal secret communicated to thousands was faithfully preserved during the long march from Thessalonica to the gates of Constantinople As soon as they had resolved his death they condescended to flatter his pride the ambitious praefect was seduced to believe that those powerful auxiliaries might be tempted to place the diadem on his head and the treasures which he distributed with a tardy and reluctant hand were accepted by the indignant multitude as an insult rather than as a gift At the distance of a mile from the capital in the field of Mars before the palace of Hebdomon the troops halted and the emperor as well as his minister advanced according to ancient custom respectfully to salute the power which supported their throne As Rufinus passed along the ranks and disguised  with studied courtesy his innate haughtiness the wings insensibly wheeled from the right and left and inclosed the devoted victim within the circle of their arms Before he could reflect on the danger of his situation Gainas gave the signal of death a daring and forward soldier plunged his sword into the breast of the guilty praefect and Rufinus fell groaned and expired at the feet of the affrighted emperor If the agonies of a moment could expiate the crimes of a whole life or if the outrages inflicted on a breathless corpse could be the object of pity our humanity might perhaps be affected by the horrid circumstances which accompanied the murder of Rufinus His mangled body was abandoned to the brutal fury of the populace of either sex who hastened in crouds from every quarter of the city to trample on the remains of the haughty minister at whose frown they had so lately trembled His right hand was cut off and carried through the streets of Constantinople in cruel mockery to extort contributions for the avaricious tyrant whose head was publicly exposed borne aloft on the point of a long lance  The  dissection  of Rufinus which Claudian performs with the savage coolness of an anatomist in Rufin ii is likewise specified by Zosimus and Jerom tom i p  According to the savage maxims of the Greek republics his innocent family would have shared the punishment of his crimes The wife and daughter of Rufinus were indebted for their safety to the influence of religion  Her  sanctuary protected them from the raging madness of the people and they were  permitted to spend the remainder of their lives in the exercises of Christian devotion in the peaceful retirement of Jerusalem  The Pagan Zosimus mentions their sanctuary and pilgrimage The sister of Rufinus Sylvania who passed her life at Jerusalem is famous in monastic history The studious virgin had diligently and even repeatedly perused the commentators on the Bible Origen Gregory Basil c to the amount of five

tit xlii leg The new ministers attempted with inconsistent avarice to seize the spoils of their predecessor and to provide for their own future security  Even Stilicho did not derive from the murder of his rival the fruit which he had proposed and though he gratified his revenge his ambition was disappointed Under the name of a favourite the weakness of Arcadius required a master but he naturally preferred the obsequious arts of the eunuch Eutropius who had obtained his domestic confidence and the emperor contemplated with terror and aversion the stern genius of a foreign warrior Till they were divided by the jealousy of power the sword of Gainas and the charms of Eudoxia supported the favour of the great chamberlain of the palace the perfidious Goth who was appointed mastergeneral of the East betrayed without scruple the interest of his benefactor and the same troops who had so lately massacred the enemy of Stilicho were engaged to support against him the independence of the throne of Constantinople The favourites of Arcadius fomented a secret and irreconcileable war against a formidable hero who aspired to govern and to defend the two empires of Rome and the two sons of Theodosius They incessantly laboured by dark and treacherous machinations to deprive him of the esteem of the prince the respect of the people and the friendship of the Barbarians The life of Stilicho was repeatedly attempted by the dagger of hired assassins and a decree was obtained from the senate of Constantinople  to declare him an enemy of the republic and to confiscate his ample possessions in the provinces of the East At a time when the only hope of delaying the ruin of the Roman name depended on the firm union and reciprocal aid of all the nations to whom it had been gradually communicated the subjects of Arcadius and Honorius were instructed by their respective masters to view each other in a foreign and even hostile light to rejoice in their mutual calamities and to embrace as their faithful allies the Barbarians whom they excited to invade the territories of their countrymen  See Claudian i Cons Stilich l i l ii and Zosimus l v p  The natives of Italy affected

schism between old and new Rome between the Greeks and Latins  and the Greeks had not yet forgot the sentiments of hatred and contempt which their polished ancestors had so long entertained for the rude inhabitants of the West The distinction of two governments which soon produced the separation of two nations will justify my design of suspending the series of the Byzantine history to prosecute

rejected his government wisely abandoned Arcadius to his unworthy favourites and his reluctance to involve the two empires in a civil war displayed the moderation of a minister who had so often signalized his military spirit and abilities But if Stilicho had any longer endured the revolt of Africa he would have betrayed the security of the capital and the majesty of the Western emperor to the capricious insolence of a Moorish rebel Gildo  Claudian may have exaggerated the vices of Gildo but his Moorish extraction his notorious actions and the complaints of St Augustin may justify the poet's invectives Baronius Annal Eccles A D No has treated the African rebellion with skill and learning  the brother of the tyrant Firmus had preserved and obtained as the reward of his apparent fidelity the immense patrimony which was forfeited by treason long and meritorious service in the armies of Rome raised him to the dignity of a military count the narrow policy of the court of Theodosius had adopted the mischievous expedient of supporting a legal government by the interest of a powerful family and the brother of Firmus was invested with the command of Africa His ambition soon usurped the administration of justice and of the finances without account and without controul and he maintained during a reign of twelve years the possession of an office from which it was impossible  to remove him without the danger of a civil war During those twelve years the provinces of Africa groaned under the dominion of a tyrant who seemed to unite the unfeeling temper of a stranger with the partial resentments of domestic faction The forms of law were often superseded by the use of poison and if the trembling guests who were invited to the table of Gildo presumed to express their fears the insolent suspicion served only to excite his fury and he loudly summoned the ministers of death Gildo alternately indulged the passions of avarice and lust  Instat terribilis vivis morientibus haeres  Virginibus raptor thalamis obscaenus adulter  Nulla quies oritur praedâ cessante libido  Divitibusque dies et nox metuenda maritisMauris clarissima quaeque  Fastidita datur  Baronius condemns still more severely the licentiousness of Gildo as his wife his daughter and his sister were examples of perfect chastity The adulteries of the African soldiers are checked by one of the Imperial laws  and if his  days  were terrible to the rich his  nights  were not less dreadful to husbands and parents The fairest of their wives and daughters were prostituted to the embraces of the tyrant and afterwards abandoned to a ferocious troop of Barbarians and assassins the black or swarthy natives of the desert whom Gildo considered as the only guardians of his throne In the civil war between Theodosius and Eugenius the count or rather the sovereign of Africa maintained a haughty and suspicious neutrality refused to assist either of the contending parties with troops or vessels expected the declaration of fortune and reserved  for the conqueror the vain professions of his allegiance Such professions would not have satisfied the master of the Roman world but the death of Theodosius and the weakness and discord of his sons confirmed the power of the Moor who condescended as a proof of his moderation to abstain from the use of the diadem and to supply Rome with the customary tribute or rather subsidy of corn In every division of the empire the five provinces of Africa were invariably assigned to the West and Gildo had consented to govern that extensive country in the name of Honorius but his knowledge of the character and designs of Stilicho soon engaged him to address his homage to a more distant and feeble sovereign The ministers of Arcadius embraced the cause of a perfidious rebel and the delusive hope of adding the numerous cities of Africa to the empire of the East tempted them to assert a claim which they were incapable of supporting either by reason or by arms  Inque tuam sortem numerosas transtulit urbes Claudian de Bell Gildonico has touched with political delicacy the intrigues of the Byzantine court which are likewise mentioned by Zosimus l v p    When Stilicho had given a firm and decisive answer to the pretensions of the Byzantine court  He is condemned by the Roman senate A D  he solemnly accused the tyrant of Africa before the tribunal which had formerly judged the kings and nations of the earth and the image of the republic was revived after a long interval under the reign of Honorius The emperor transmitted an accurate and ample detail of the complaints of  the provincials and the crimes of Gildo to the Roman senate and the members of that venerable assembly were required to pronounce the condemnation of the rebel Their unanimous suffrage declared him the enemy of the republic and the decree of the senate added a sacred and legitimate sanction to the Roman arms  Symmachus l iv epist expresses the judicial forms of the senate and Claudian i Cons Stilich l i c seems to feel the spirit of a Roman  A people who still remembered that their ancestors had been the masters of the world would have applauded with conscious pride the representation of ancient freedom if they had not long since been accustomed to prefer the solid assurance of bread to the unsubstantial visions of liberty and greatness The subsistence of Rome depended on the harvests of Africa and it was evident that a declaration of war would be the signal of famine The praefect Symmachus who presided in the deliberations of the senate admonished the minister of his just apprehension that as soon as the revengeful Moor should prohibit the exportation of corn the tranquillity and perhaps the safety of the capital would be threatened by the hungry rage of a turbulent multitude  Claudian finely displays these complaints of Symmachus in a speech of the goddess of Rome before the throne of Jupiter de Bell Gildon  The prudence of Stilicho conceived and executed without delay the most effectual measure for the relief of the Roman people A large and seasonable supply of corn collected in the inland provinces of Gaul was embarked on the rapid stream  of the Rhone and transported by an easy navigation from the Rhone to the Tyber During the whole term of the African war the granaries of Rome were continually filled

where he soon received the cruel intelligence that his two innocent and helpless children had been murdered by their inhuman uncle The affliction of the father was suspended only by the desire of revenge The vigilant Stilicho already prepared to collect the naval and military forces of the Western empire and he had resolved if the tyrant should be able to wage an equal and doubtful war to march against him in person But as Italy required his  presence and as it might be dangerous to weaken the defence of the frontier he judged it more adviseable that Mascezel should attempt this arduous adventure at the head of a chosen body of Gallic veterans who had lately served under the standard of Eugenius These troops who were exhorted to convince the world that they could subvert as well as defend the throne of an usurper consisted of the  Jovian  the  Herculian  and the  Augustan  legions of the  Nervian  auxiliaries of the soldiers who displayed in their banners the symbol of a

custom in tumultuary flight and Mascezel obtained the honours of an easy and almost bloodless victory  Zosimus l v p supposes an obstinate combat but the narrative of Orosius appears to conceal a real fact under the disguise of a miracle  The tyrant escaped from the field of battle to the seashore and threw himself into a small vessel with the hope of reaching in safety some friendly port of the empire of the East but the obstinacy of the wind drove him back into the harbour of Tabraca  Tabraca lay between the two Hippos Cellarius tom ii p ii p d'Anville tom iii p Orosius has distinctly named the field of battle but our ignorance cannot define the precise situation  which had acknowledged with the rest  of the province the dominion of Honorius and the authority of his lieutenant The inhabitants as a proof of their repentance and loyalty seized and confined the person of Gildo in a dungeon and his own despair saved him from the intolerable torture of supporting the presence of an injured and victorious brother  The death of Gildo is expressed by Claudian i Cons Stil l and his best interpreters Zosimus and Orosius  The captives and the spoils of Africa were laid at the feet of the emperor but Stilicho whose moderation appeared more conspicuous and more sincere in the midst of prosperity still affected to consult the laws of the republic and referred to the senate and people of Rome the judgment of the most illustrious criminals  Claudian ii Cons Stilich describes their trial tremuit quos Africa nuper cernunt rostra reos and applauds the restoration of the ancient constitution It is here that he introduces the famous sentence so familiar to the friends of despotism  Nunquam libertas gratior exstat  Quam sub rege pio  But the freedom which depends on royal piety scarcely deserves that appellation  Their trial was public and solemn but the judges in the exercise of this obsolete and precarious jurisdiction were impatient to punish the African magistrates who had intercepted the subsistence of the Roman people The rich and guilty province was oppressed by the Imperial ministers who had a visible interest to multiply the number of the accomplices of Gildo and if an edict of Honorius seems to check the malicious industry of informers  a subsequent edict at the distance of ten years continues and renews the prosecution of the offences which had been committed in the time of the general rebellion  See the Theodosian Code l ix tit xxxix leg tit xl leg  The adherents of the tyrant who escaped the first fury of the soldiers and the judges might derive some consolation from the tragic fate of his brother who could never obtain his pardon for the extraordinary services which he had performed After he had finished an important war in the space of a single winter Mascezel was received at the court of Milan with loud applause affected gratitude and secret jealousy  Stilicho who claimed an equal share in all the victories of Theodosius and his son particularly asserts that Africa was recovered by the wisdom of  his  counsels see an Inscription produced by Baronius  and his death which perhaps was the effect of accident has been considered as the crime of Stilicho In the passage of a bridge the Moorish prince who accompanied the mastergeneral of the West was suddenly thrown from his horse into the river the officious haste of the attendants was restrained by a cruel and presidious smile which they observed on the countenance of Stilicho and while they delayed the necessary assistance the unfortunate Mascezel was irrecoverably drowned  I have softened the narrative of Zosimus which in its crude simplicity is almost incredible l v p Orosius damns the victorious general p for violating the right of sanctuary    The joy of the African triumph was happily connected with the nuptials of the emperor Honorius  Marriage and character of Honorius A D  and of his cousin Maria the daughter of Stilicho and this equal and honourable alliance seemed to invest the powerful minister with the authority of a parent over his submissive pupil The muse of Claudian was not silent on this propitious day  Claudian as the poet laureat composed a serious and elaborate epithalamium of lines besides some gay Fescennines which were sung in a more licentious tone on the weddingnight  he sung in various and lively strains the happiness of the royal pair and the glory of the hero who confirmed their union and supported their throne The ancient fables of Greece which had almost ceased to be the object of religious faith were saved from oblivion by the genius of poetry The picture of the Cyprian grove the seat of harmony and love the triumphant progress of Venus over her native seas and the mild influence which her presence diffused in the palace of Milan express to every age the natural sentiments of the heart in the just and pleasing language of allegorical fiction But the amorous impatience which Claudian attributes to the young prince  Calet obvius ire  Jam princeps tardumque cupit discedere solem  Nobilis haud aliter  sonipes  de Nuptiis Honor et Mariae and more freely in the Fescennines  Dices  O quoties  hoc mihi dulcius  Quam flavos  decies  vincere Sarmatas  Tum victor madido prosilias toro  Nocturni referens vulnera proelii  must excite the smiles of the court and his beauteous spouse if she deserved the praise of beauty had not  much to fear or to hope from the passions of her lover Honorius was only in the fourteenth year of his age Serena the mother of his bride deferred by art or persuasion the consummation of the royal nuptials Maria died a virgin after she had been ten years a wife and the chastity of the emperor was secured by the coldness or perhaps the debility of his constitution  See Zosimus l v p  His subjects who attentively studied the character of their young sovereign discovered that Honorius was without passions and consequently without talents and that his feeble and languid disposition was alike incapable of discharging the duties of his rank or of enjoying the pleasures of his age In his early youth he made some progress in the exercises of riding and drawing the bow but he soon relinquished these fatiguing occupations and the amusement of feeding poultry became the serious and daily care of the monarch of the West  Procopius de Bell Gothico l i c I have borrowed the general practice of Honorius without adopting the singular and indeed improbable tale which is related by the Greek historian  who resigned the reins of empire to the firm and skilful hand of his guardian Stilicho The experience of history will countenance the suspicion that a prince who was born in the purple received a worse education than the meanest peasant of his dominions and that the ambitious minister suffered him to attain the age of manhood without attempting to excite his courage or to enlighten his understanding  The lessons of Theodosius or rather Claudian iv Cons Honor might compose a fine institution for the future prince of a great and free nation It was far above Honorius and his degenerate subjects    The predecessors of Honorius were accustomed to animate by their example or at least by their presence the valour of the legions and the dates of their laws attest the perpetual activity of their motions through the provinces of the Roman world But the son of Theodosius passed the slumber of his life a captive in his palace a stranger in his country and the patient almost the indifferent spectator of the ruin of the Western empire which was repeatedly attacked and finally subverted by the arms of the Barbarians In the eventful history of a reign of twentyeight years it will seldom be necessary to mention the name of the emperor Honorius  CHAP XXX

Revolt of the Goths A D  supported the frail and mouldering edifice of the republic He died in the month of January and before the end of the winter of the same year the Gothic nation was in arms  The revolt of the Goths and the blockade of Constantinople are distinctly mentioned by Claudian in Rufin l ii Zosimus l v p and Jornandes de Rebus Geticis c  The Barbarian auxiliaries erected their independent standard and boldly avowed the hostile designs which they had long cherished in their ferocious minds Their countrymen who had been condemned by the conditions of the last treaty to a life of tranquillity and labour deserted their farms at the first sound of the trumpet and eagerly resumed the weapons which they had reluctantly laid down The barriers of the Danube were thrown open the savage warriors of Scythia issued from their forests and the uncommon severity of the winter allowed the poet to remark  "that they  rolled their ponderous waggons over the broad and icy back of the indignant river  Alii per terga ferocis  Danubii solidata ruunt expertaque remis  Frangunt stagna rotis  Claudian and Ovid often amuse their fancy by interchanging the metaphors and properties of  liquid  water and  solid  ice Much false wit has been expended in this easy exercise  "  The unhappy natives of the provinces to the South of the Danube submitted to the calamities which in the course of twenty years were almost grown familiar to their imagination and the various troops of Barbarians who gloried in the Gothic name were irregularly spread from the woody shores of Dalmatia to the walls of Constantinople  Jerom tom i p He endeavours to comfort his friend Heliodorus bishop of Altinum for the loss of his nephew Nepotian by a curious recapitulation of all the public and private misfortunes of the times See Tillemont Mem Eccles tom xii p c  The interruption or at least the diminution of the subsidy which the Goths had received from the prudent liberality of Theodosius was the specious pretence of their revolt the affront was embittered by their contempt for the unwarlike sons of Theodosius and their resentment was inflamed by the weakness or treachery of the minister of Arcadius The frequent visits of Rufinus to the camp of the Barbarians whose arms and apparel he affected to imitate were considered as a sufficient evidence of his guilty correspondence and the public enemy from a motive either of gratitude or of policy was attentive amidst the general devastation to spare the private estates of the unpopular praefect The Goths instead  of being impelled by the blind and headstrong passions of their chiefs were now directed by the bold and artful genius of Alaric That renowned leader was descended from the noble race of the Balti  Baltha  or  bold  origo mirifica says Jorandes c This illustrious race long continued to flourish in France in the Gothic province of Septimania or Languedoc under the corrupted appellation of  Baux  and a branch of that family afterwards settled in the kingdom of Naples Grotius in Prolegom ad Hist Gothic p The lords of Baux near Arles and of seventynine subordinate places were independent of the counts of Provence Longuerue Description de la France tom i p  which yielded only to the royal dignity of the Amali he had solicited the command of the Roman armies and the Imperial court provoked him to demonstrate the folly of their refusal and the importance of their loss Whatever hopes might be entertained of the conquest of Constantinople the judicious general soon abandoned an impracticable enterprise In the midst of a divided court and a discontented people the emperor Arcadius was terrified by the aspect of the Gothic arms but the want of wisdom and valour was supplied by the strength of the city and the fortifications both of the sea and land might securely brave the impotent and random darts of the Barbarians Alaric disdained to trample any longer on the prostrate and ruined countries of Thrace and Dacia and he resolved to seek a plentiful harvest of fame and riches in a province which had hitherto escaped the ravages of war  Zosimus l v p is our best guide for the conquest of Greece but the hints and allusion of Claudian are so many rays of historic light    The character of the civil and military officers on whom Rufinus had devolved the government of Greece confirmed the public suspicion that  Alaric marches into Greece A D  he had betrayed the ancient seat of freedom and learning to the Gothic invader The proconsul Antiochus was the unworthy son of a respectable father and Gerontius who commanded the provincial troops was much better qualified to execute the oppressive orders of a tyrant than to defend with courage and ability a country most remarkably fortified by the hand of nature Alaric had traversed without resistance the plains of Macedonia and Thessaly as far as the foot of Mount Oeta a steep and woody range of hills almost impervious to his cavalry They stretched from East to West to the edge of the seashore and left between the precipice and the Malian Gulf an interval of three hundred feet which in some places was contracted to a road capable of admitting only a single carriage  Compare Herodotus l vii c and Livy xxxvi The narrow entrance of Greece was probably enlarged by each successive ravisher  In this narrow pass of Thermopylae where Leonidas and the three hundred Spartans had gloriously devoted their lives the Goths might have been stopped or destroyed by a skilful general and perhaps the view of that sacred spot might have kindled some sparks of military ardour in the breasts of the degenerate Greeks The troops which had been posted to defend the streights of Thermopylae retired as they were directed without attempting to disturb the secure and rapid passage  of Alaric  He passed says Eunapius in Vit Philosoph p edit Commelin through the streights  of Thermopylae    and the fertile fields of Phocis and Baeotia were instantly covered by a deluge of Barbarians who massacred the males of an age to bear arms and drove away the beautiful females with the spoil and cattle of the flaming villages The travellers who visited Greece several years afterwards could easily discover the deep and bloody traces of the march of the Goths and Thebes was less indebted for her preservation to the strength of her seven gates than to the eager haste of Alaric who advanced to occupy the city of Athens and the important harbour of the Piraeus The same impatience urged him to prevent the delay and danger of a siege by the offer of a capitulation and as soon as the Athenians heard the voice of the Gothic herald they were easily persuaded to deliver the greatest part of their wealth as the ransom of the city of Minerva and its inhabitants The treaty was ratified by solemn oaths and observed with mutual fidelity The Gothic prince with a small and select train was admitted within the walls he indulged himself in the refreshment of the bath accepted a splendid banquet which was provided by the magistrate and affected to shew that he was not ignorant of the manners of civilised nations  In obedience to Jerom and Claudian in Rufin l ii I have mixed some darker colours in the mild representation of Zosimus who wished to soften the calamities of Athens  Nec fera Cecropias traxissent vincula matres  Synesius Epist clvi p edit Petav observes that Athens whose sufferings he imputes to the proconsul's avarice was at that time less famous for her schools of philosophy than for her trade of honey  But the whole territory of Attica  from the promontory of Sunium to the town of Megara was blasted by his baleful presence and if we may use the comparison of a contemporary philosopher Athens itself resembled the bleeding and empty skin of a slaughtered victim The distance between Megara and Corinth could not much exceed thirty miles but the  bad road  an expressive name which it still bears among the the Greeks was or might easily have been made impassable for the march of an enemy The thick and gloomy woods of Mount Cithaeron covered the inland country the Scironian rocks approached the water's edge and hung over the narrow and winding path which was confined above six miles along the seashore  Vallata mari Scironia rupes  Et duo continuo connectens aequora muro  Isthmos  Claudian de Bell Getico  The Scironian rocks are described by Pausanias l i c p edit Kuhn and our modern travellers Wheeler p and Chandler p Hadrian made the road passable for two carriages  The passage of those rocks so infamous in every age was terminated by the isthmus of Corinth and a small body of firm and intrepid soldiers might have successfully defended a temporary intrenchment of five or six miles from the Ionian to the Aegean sea The confidence of the cities of Peloponnesus in their natural rampart had tempted them to  neglect the care of their antique walls and the avarice of the Roman governors had exhausted and betrayed the unhappy province  Claudian in Rufin l ii and de Bello Getico c vaguely though forcibly delineates the scene of rapine and destruction  Corinth Argos Sparta yielded without resistance to the arms of the Goths and the most fortunate of the inhabitants were saved by death from beholding the slavery of their families and the conflagration of their cities  c These generous lines of Homer Odyss l v were transcribed by one of the captive youths of Corinth and the tears of Mummius may prove that the rude conqueror though he was ignorant of the value of an original picture possessed the purest source of good taste a benevolent heart Plutarch Symposiac l ix tom ii p edit Wechel  The vases and statues were distributed among the Barbarians with more regard to the value of the materials than to the elegance of the workmanship the female captives submitted to the laws of war the enjoyment of beauty was the reward of valour and the Greeks could not reasonably complain of an abuse which was justified by the example of the heroic times  Homer perpetually describes the exemplary patience of these female captives who gave their charms and even their hearts to the murderers of their fathers brothers c Such a passion of Eriphile for Achilles is touched with admirable delicacy by Racine  The descendants of that extraordinary people who had considered valour and discipline as the walls of Sparta no longer remembered the generous reply of their ancestors to an invader more formidable than Alaric  "If thou art a god thou wilt not hurt those who have never injured thee if thou art a man  advanceand thou wilt find men equal to thyself  Plutarch in Pyrrho tom ii p edit Brian gives the genuine answer in the Laconic dialect Pyrrhus attacked Sparta with foot horse and elephants and the defence of that open town is a fine comment on the laws of Lycurgus even in the last stage of decay  "  From Thermopylae to Sparta the leader of the Goths pursued his victorious march without encountering any mortal antagonists but one of the advocates of expiring Paganism has confidently asserted that the walls of Athens were guarded by the goddess Minerva with her formidable Aegis and by the angry phantom of Achilles  Such perhaps as Homer Iliad xx has so nobly painted him  and that the conqueror was dismayed by the presence of the hostile deities of Greece In an age of miracles it would perhaps be unjust to dispute the claim of the historian Zosimus to the common benefit yet it cannot be dissembled that the mind of Alaric was ill prepared to receive either in sleeping or waking visions the impressions of Greek superstition The songs of Homer and the fame of Achilles had probably never reached the ear of the illiterate  Barbarian  and the  Christian  faith which he had devoutly embraced taught him to despise the imaginary deities of Rome and Athens The invasion of the Goths instead of vindicating the honour contributed at least accidentally to extirpate the last remains of Paganism and the mysteries of Ceres which had subsisted eighteen hundred  years did not survive the destruction of Eleusis and the calamities of Greece  Eunapius in Vit Philosoph p intimates that a troop of Monks betrayed Greece and followed the Gothic camp    The last hope of a people who could no longer depend on their arms their gods or their sovereign  He is attacked by Stilicho A D  was placed in the powerful assistance of the general of the West and Stilicho who had not been permitted to repulse advanced to chastise the invaders of Greece  For Stilicho's Greek war compare the honest narrative of Zosimus l v p with the curious circumstantial flattery of Claudian i Cons Stilich l i iv Cons Hon As the event was not glorious it is artfully thrown into the shade  A numerous fleet was equipped in the ports of Italy and the troops after a short and prosperous navigation over the Ionian sea were safely disembarked on the isthmus near the ruins of Corinth The woody and mountainous country of Arcadia the fabulous residence of Pan and the Dryads became the scene of a long and doubtful conflict between two generals not unworthy of each other The skill and perseverance of the Roman at length prevailed and the Goths after sustaining a considerable loss from disease and desertion gradually retreated to the lofty mountain of Pholoe near the sources of the Peneus and on the frontiers of Elis a sacred country which had formerly been exempted from the calamities of war  The troops who marched through Elis delivered up their arms This security enriched the Eleans who were lovers of a rural life Riches begat pride they disdained their privilege and they suffered Polybius advises them to retire once more within their magic circle See a learned and judicious discourse on the Olympic games which Mr West has prefixed to his translation of Pindar  The camp of the Barbarians  was immediately besieged the waters of the river  Claudian in iv Cons Hon alludes to the fact without naming the river perhaps the Alpheus i Cons Stil l i  Et Alpheus Geticis angustus acervis  Tardior ad Siculos etiamnum pergit

stable Cellarius tom i p Chandler's Travels p  were diverted into another channel and while they laboured under the intolerable pressure of thirst and hunger a strong line of circumvallation was formed to prevent their escape After these precautions Stilicho too confident of victory retired to enjoy his triumph in the theatrical games and lascivious dances of the Greeks his soldiers deserting their standards spread themselves over the country of their allies which they stripped of all that had been saved from the rapacious hands of the enemy Alaric appears to have seized the favourable moment to execute one of those hardy enterprises in which the abilities of a general are displayed with more genuine lustre than in the tumult of a day of battle To extricate himself from the prison of Peloponnesus it was necessary that he should pierce the intrenchments which surrounded his camp that he should perform a difficult and dangerous march of thirty miles as far as the Gulf of Corinth and that he should transport his troops his captives and his  spoil over an arm of the sea which in the narrow interval between Rhium and the opposite shore is at least half a mile in breadth  Strabo l viii p Plin Hist Natur iv Wheeler p Chandler p They measured from different points the distance between the two lands  The  escapes to Epirus  operations of Alaric must have been secret prudent and rapid since the Roman general was confounded by the intelligence that the Goths who had eluded his efforts were in full possession of the important province of Epirus This unfortunate delay allowed Alaric sufficient time to conclude the treaty which he secretly negociated with the ministers of Constantinople The apprehension of a civil war compelled Stilicho to retire at the haughty mandate of his rivals from the dominions of Arcadius and he respected in the enemy of Rome the honourable character of the ally and servant of the emperor of the East  A Grecian philosopher  Synesius passed

Philosopher was made bishop of Ptolemais A D and died about See Tillemont Mem Eccles tom xii p  who visited Constantinople soon after the death of Theodosius published  Alaric is declared mastergeneral of the Eastern Illyricum A D  his liberal opinions concerning the duties of kings and the state of the Roman republic Synesius observes and deplores the fatal abuse which the imprudent bounty of the late emperor had introduced into the military service The citizens and subjects had purchased an exemption from the indispensable duty of defending  their country which was supported by the arms of Barbarian mercenaries The fugitives of Scythia were permitted to disgrace the illustrious dignities of the empire their ferocious youth who disdained the salutary restraint of laws were more anxious to acquire the riches than to imitate the arts of a people the object of their contempt and hatred and the power of the Goths was the stone of Tantalus perpetually suspended over the peace and safety of the devoted state The measures which Synesius recommends are the dictates of a bold and generous patriot He exhorts the emperor to revive the courage of his subjects by the example of manly virtue to banish luxury from the court and from the camp to substitute in the place of the Barbarian mercenaries an army of men interested in the defence of their laws and of their property to force in such a moment of public danger the mechanic from his shop and the philosopher from his school to rouse the indolent citizen from his dream of pleasure and to arm for the protection of agriculture the hands of the laborious husbandman At the head of such troops who might deserve the name and would display the spirit of Romans he animates the son of Theodosius to encounter a race of Barbarians who were destitute of any real courage and never to lay down his arms till he had chaced them far away into the solitudes of Scythia or had reduced them to the state of ignominious servitude which the Lacedaemonians formerly imposed on the captive Helots  Synesius de Regno p  The  court of Arcadius indulged the zeal applauded the eloquence and neglected the advice of Synesius Perhaps the philosopher who addresses the emperor of the East in the language of reason and virtue which he might have used to a Spartan king had not condescended to form a practicable scheme consistent with the temper and circumstances of a degenerate age Perhaps the pride of the ministers whose business was seldom interrupted by reflection might reject as wild and visionary every proposal which exceeded the measure of their capacity and deviated from the forms and precedents of office While the oration of Synesius and the downfal of the Barbarians were the topics of popular conversation an edict was published at Constantinople which declared the promotion of Alaric to the rank of mastergeneral of the Eastern Illyricum The Roman provincials and the allies who had respected the faith of treaties were justly indignant that the ruin of Greece and Epirus should be so liberally rewarded The Gothic conqueror was received as a lawful magistrate in the cities which he had so lately besieged The fathers whose sons he had massacred the husbands whose wives he had violated were subject to his authority and the success of his rebellion encouraged the ambition of every leader of the foreign mercenaries The use to which Alaric applied his new command distinguishes the firm and judicious character of his policy He issued his orders to the four magazines and manufactures of offensive and defensive arms Margus Ratiaria Naissus  and Thessalonica to provide his troops with an extraordinary supply of shields helmets swords and spears the unhappy provincials were compelled to forge the instruments of their own destruction and the Barbarians removed the only defect which had sometimes disappointed the efforts of their courage  qui foedera rumpit  Ditatur

courts of Arcadius and Honorius  Discors odiisque anceps civilibus Orbis  Non sua vis tutata diu dum foedera fallax  Ludit et alternae perjuria venditat aulae  Claudian de Bell Get  till he declared and executed his resolution of invading the dominions of the West The provinces of Europe which belonged to the  Eastern emperor were already exhausted those of Asia were inaccessible and the strength of Constantinople had resisted his attack But he was tempted by the fame the beauty the wealth of Italy which he had twice visited and he secretly aspired to plant the Gothic standard on the walls of Rome and to enrich his army with the accumulated spoils of three hundred triumphs  Alpibus Italiae ruptis penetrabis ad  Urbem  This authentic prediction was announced by Alaric or at least by Claudian de Bell Getico seven years before the event But as it was not accomplished within the term which has been rashly fixed the interpreters escaped through an ambiguous meaning    The scarcity of facts  Our best materials are verses of Claudian in the poem on the Getic war and the beginning of that which celebrates the sixth consulship of Honorius Zosimus is totally silent and we are reduced

fought A D but we cannot easily fill the interval  oppose our attempts to describe the circumstances of the first invasion of Italy by the arms of Alaric His march perhaps from Thessalonica through the warlike and hostile country of Pannonia as far as the foot of the Julian Alps his passage of those mountains which were strongly guarded by troops and intrenchments the siege of Aquileia and the conquest of the provinces of Istria and Venetia appear to have employed a considerable time Unless his operations were extremely cautious and slow the  length of the interval would suggest a probable suspicion that the Gothic king retreated towards the banks of the Danube and reinforced his army with fresh swarms of Barbarians before he again attempted to penetrate into the heart of Italy Since the public and important events escape the diligence of the historian he may amuse himself with contemplating for a moment the influence of the arms of Alaric on the fortunes of two obscure individuals a presbyter of Aquileia and an husbandman of Verona The learned Rufinus who was summoned by his enemies to appear before a Roman synod  Tantum Romanae urbis judicium fugis ut magis obsidionem barbaricam quam  pacatae  urbis judicium velis sustinere Jerom tom ii p Rufinus understood his own danger the  peaceful  city was inflamed by the beldam Marcella and the rest of Jerom's faction  wisely preferred the dangers of a besieged city and the Barbarians who furiously shook the walls of Aquileia might save him from the cruel sentence of another heretic who at the request of the same bishops was severely whipped and condemned to perpetual exile on a desert island  Jovinian the enemy of fasts and of celibacy who was persecuted and insulted by the furious Jerom Jortin's Remarks vol iv p c See the original edict of banishment in the Theodosian Code l xvi tit v leg  The  old man  This epigram de Sene Veronensi qui suburbium nusquam egressus est is one of the earliest and most pleasing compositions of Claudian Cowley's imitation Hurd's edition vol ii p has some natural and happy strokes but it is much inferior to the original portrait which is evidently drawn from the life  who had passed his simple and innocent life in the neighbourhood of Verona was a stranger to the  quarrels both of kings and bishops  his  pleasures his desires his knowledge were confined within the little circle of his paternal farm and a staff supported his aged steps on the same ground where he had sported in his infancy Yet even this humble and rustic felicity which Claudian describes with so much truth and feeling was still exposed to the undistinguishing rage of war His trees his old  contemporary  trees  Ingentem meminit parvo qui germine quercum  Aequaevumque videt consenuisse nemus  A neighbouring wood born with himself he sees  And loves his old contemporary trees  In this passage Cowley is perhaps superior to his original and the English poet who was a good botanist has concealed the  oaks  under a more general expression  must blaze in the conflagration of the whole country a detachment of Gothic cavalry might sweep away his cottage and his family and the power of Alaric could destroy this happiness which he was not able either to taste or to bestow  "Fame" says the poet "encircling with terror her gloomy wings proclaimed the march of the Barbarian army and filled Italy with consternation"  the apprehensions of each individual were increased in just proportion to the measure of his fortune and the most timid who had already embarked their valuable effects meditated their escape to the island of Sicily or the African coast The public distress was aggravated by the fears and reproaches of superstition  Claudian de Bell Get He may seem prolix but fear and superstition occupied as large a space in the minds of the Italians  Every hour produced  some horrid tale of strange and portentous accidents the Pagans deplored the neglect of omens and the interruption of sacrifices but the Christians still derived some comfort from the powerful intercession of the saints and martyrs  From the passages of Paulinus which Baronius has produced Annal Eccles A D No it is manifest that the general alarm had pervaded all Italy as far as Nola in Campania where that famous penitent had fixed his abode    The emperor Honorius was distinguished above  Honorius flies from Milan A D  his subjects by the preeminence of fear as well as of rank The pride and luxury in which he was educated had not allowed him to suspect that there existed on the earth any power presumptuous enough to invade the repose of the successor of Augustus The arts of flattery concealed the impending danger till Alaric approached the palace of Milan But when the sound of war had awakened the young emperor instead of flying to arms with the spirit or even the rashness of his age he eagerly listened to those timid counsellors who proposed to convey his sacred person and his faithful attendants to some secure and distant station in the provinces of Gaul Stilicho alone  Solus erat Stilicho c is the exclusive commendation which Claudian bestows de Bell Get without condescending to except the emperor How insignificant must Honorius have appeared in his own court  had courage and authority to resist this disgraceful measure which would have abandoned Rome and Italy to the Barbarians but as the troops of the palace had been lately detached to the Rhaetian frontier and as the source of new levies was slow and precarious  the general of the West could only promise that if the court of Milan would maintain their ground during his absence he would soon return with an army equal to the encounter of the Gothic king Without losing a moment while each moment was so important to the public safety Stilicho hastily embarked on the Larian lake ascended the mountains of ice and snow amidst the severity of an Alpine winter and suddenly repressed by his unexpected presence the enemy who had disturbed the tranquillity of Rhaetia  The face of the country and the hardiness of Stilicho are finely described de Bell Get  The Barbarians perhaps some tribes of the Alemanni respected the firmness of a chief who still assumed the language of command and the choice which he condescended to make of a select number of their bravest youth was considered as a mark of his esteem and favour The cohorts who were delivered from the neighbouring foe diligently repaired to the Imperial standard and Stilicho issued his orders to the most remote troops of the West to advance by rapid marches to the defence of Honorius and of Italy The fortresses of the Rhine were abandoned and the safety of Gaul was protected only by the faith of the Germans and the ancient terror of the Roman name Even the legion which had been stationed to guard the wall of Britain against the Caledonians of the North was hastily recalled  Venit et extremis legio praetenta Britannis  Quae Scoto dat frena truci  De Bell Get  Yet the most rapid march from Edinburgh or Newcastle to Milan must have required a longer space of time than Claudian seems willing to allow for the duration of the Gothic war    and a numerous body of the cavalry of the Alani was persuaded to engage in the service of the emperor who anxiously expected the return of his general The prudence and vigour of Stilicho were conspicuous on this occasion which revealed at the same time the weakness of the falling empire The legions of Rome which had long since languished in the gradual decay of discipline and courage were exterminated by the Gothic and civil wars and it was found impossible without exhausting and exposing the provinces to assemble an army for the defence of Italy  When Stilicho seemed to abandon his sovereign  He is pursued and besieged by the Goths  in the unguarded palace of Milan he had probably calculated the term of his absence the distance of the enemy and the obstacles that might retard their march He principally depended on the rivers of Italy the Adige the Mincius the Oglio and the Addua which in the winter or spring by the fall of rains or by the melting of the snows are commonly swelled into broad and impetuous torrents  Every traveller must recollect the face of Lombardy see Fontenelle tom v p which is often tormented by the capricious and

without impediment the wide and stony beds whose centre was faintly marked by the course of a shallow stream The bridge and passage of the Addua were secured by a strong detachment of the Gothic army and as Alaric approached the walls or rather the suburbs of Milan he enjoyed the proud satisfaction of seeing the emperor of the Romans fly before him Honorius accompanied by a feeble train of statesmen and eunuchs hastily retreated towards the Alps with a design of securing his person in the city of Arles which had often been the royal residence of his predecessors But Honorius  Claudian

The siege of an obscure place which contained so rich a prize and seemed incapable of a long resistance was instantly formed and indefatigably pressed by the king of the Goths and the bold declaration

capitulation the Imperial captive was suddenly relieved by the fame the approach and at length the presence of the hero whom he had so long expected At the head of a chosen and intrepid vanguard Stilicho swam the stream of the Addua to gain the time which he must have lost in the attack of the bridge the passage of the Po was an enterprise of much less hazard and difficulty and the successful action in which he cut his way through the Gothic camp under the walls of Asta revived the hopes and vindicated the honour of Rome Instead of grasping the fruit of his victory the Barbarian was gradually invested on every side by the troops of the West who successively issued through all the passes of the Alps his quarters were straightened his convoys were intercepted and the vigilance of the Romans prepared to form a chain of fortifications and to besiege the lines of the besiegers A military council was assembled of the longhaired chiefs of the Gothic nation of aged warriors whose bodies were wrapped in furs and whose stern countenances were marked with honourable wounds They weighed the glory of persisting  in their attempt against the advantage of securing their plunder and they recommended the prudent measure of a seasonable retreat In this important debate Alaric displayed the spirit of the conqueror of Rome and after he had reminded his countrymen of their atchievements and of their designs he concluded his animating speech by the solemn and positive assurance that he was resolved to find in Italy either a kingdom or a grave  Hanc ego vel victor regno

and as soon as they had recovered from their astonishment the pious confidence that the God of the Christians would assert their cause added new strength to their native valour In this engagement which was long maintained with equal courage and success the chief of the Alani whose diminutive and savage form concealed a magnanimous soul approved his suspected loyalty by the zeal with which he fought and fell in the service of the republic and the fame of this gallant Barbarian has been imperfectly preserved in the verses of Claudian since the poet who celebrates his virtue has omitted the mention of his name His death was followed by the flight and dismay of the squadrons which he commanded and the defeat of the wing of cavalry might have decided the victory of Alaric if Stilicho had not immediately led the Roman and Barbarian infantry to the attack The skill of the general and the bravery of the soldiers surmounted every obstacle In the evening of the bloody day the Goths retreated from the field of battle the intrenchments of their camp were forced and the scene of rapine and slaughter made some atonement  for the calamities which they had inflicted on the subjects of

huge bones and the empty helmets of the Cimbri and of the Goths would easily be confounded by succeeding generations and posterity might erect a common trophy to the memory of the two most illustrious generals who had vanquished on the same memorable ground the two most formidable enemies of Rome  Claudian's peroration is strong and elegant but the identity of the Cimbric and Gothic fields must be understood like Virgil's Philippi Georgic i according to the loose geography of a poet Vercellae and Pollentia are sixty miles from each other and the latitude is still greater if the Cimbri were

and partial muse bestows more genuine praise on the character of the Gothic king His name is indeed branded with the reproachful epithets of pirate and robber to which the conquerors of every age are so justly entitled but the poet of Stilicho is compelled to acknowledge that Alaric possessed the invincible temper of mind which rises superior to every misfortune and derives new resources from adversity After the total defeat of his infantry he escaped or rather withdrew from the field of battle with the greatest part of his cavalry entire and unbroken Without wasting a moment to lament the irreparable loss of so many brave companions he left his victorious enemy to bind in chains the captive images of a Gothic king  Et gravant en airain ses frêles avantages  De mes etats conquis

Supplement Livian ciii  and boldly resolved to break through the unguarded passes of the Apennine to spread desolation over the fruitful face of Tuscany and to conquer or die before the  gates of Rome The capital was saved by the active and incessant diligence of Stilicho but he respected the despair of his enemy and instead of committing the fate of the republic to the chance of another battle he proposed to purchase the absence of the Barbarians The spirit of Alaric would have rejected such terms the permission of a retreat and the offer of a pension with contempt and indignation but he exercised a limited and precarious authority over the independent chieftains who had raised him for  their  service above the rank of his equals they were still less disposed to follow an unsuccessful general and many of them were tempted to consult their interest by a private negociation with the minister of Honorius The king submitted to the voice of his people ratified the treaty with the empire of the West and repassed the Po with the remains of the flourishing army which he had led into Italy A considerable part of the Roman forces still continued to attend his motions and Stilicho who maintained a secret correspondence with some of the Barbarian chiefs was punctually apprised of the designs that were formed in the camp and council of Alaric The king of the Goths ambitious to signalize his retreat by some splendid atchievement had resolved to occupy the important city of Verona which commands the principal passage of the Rhaetian Alps and directing his march through the territories of those German tribes whose alliance would restore his exhausted strength to invade on the side of the Rhine the wealthy and  unsuspecting provinces of Gaul Ignorant of the treason which had already betrayed his bold and judicious enterprise he advanced towards the passes of the mountains already possessed by the Imperial troops where he was exposed almost at the same instant to a general attack in the front on his flanks and in the rear In this bloody action at a small distance from the walls of Verona the loss of the Goths was not less heavy than that which they had sustained in the defeat of Pollentia and their valiant king who escaped by the swiftness of his horse must either have been slain or made prisoner if the hasty rashness of the Alani had not disappointed the measures of the Roman general Alaric secured the remains of his army on the adjacent rocks and prepared himself with undaunted resolution to maintain a siege against the superior numbers of the enemy who invested him on all sides But he could not oppose the destructive progress of hunger and disease nor was it possible for him to check the continual desertion of his impatient and capricious Barbarians In this extremity he still found resources in his own courage or in the moderation of his adversary and the retreat of the Gothic king was considered as the deliverance of Italy  The Getic war and the sixth consulship of Honorius obscurely connect the events of Alaric's retreat and losses  Yet the people and even the clergy incapable of forming any rational judgment of the business of peace and war presumed to arraign the policy of Stilicho who so often vanquished so often surrounded and so often  dismissed the implacable enemy of the republic The first moment of the public safety is devoted to gratitude and joy but the second is diligently occupied by envy and calumny  Tacco de Alarico saepe victo saepe concluso semperque dimisso Orosius l vii c p Claudian vi Cons Hon drops

walls of the capital confessed their own fears and the decline of the empire After the retreat of the Barbarians Honorius was directed to accept the dutiful invitation of the senate and to celebrate in the Imperial city the auspicious aera of the Gothic victory and of his sixth consulship  The remainder of Claudian's poem on the sixth consulship of Honorius describes the journey the triumph and the games  The suburbs and the streets from the Milvian bridge to the Palatine mount were filled by the Roman people who in the space of an hundred years had only thrice been honoured with the presence of their sovereigns While their eyes were fixed on the chariot where Stilicho was deservedly seated by the side of his royal pupil they applauded the pomp of a triumph which was not stained like that of Constantine or of Theodosius with civil blood The procession passed under a lofty arch which had been purposely erected but in less than seven years the Gothic conquerors of Rome might read if they were able to read the superb inscription of that monument which attested the total defeat and destruction  of their nation  See the inscription in Mascow's History of the Ancient Germans viii The words are positive and indiscreet Getarum nationem in omne aevum domitam c  The emperor resided several months in the capital and every part of his behaviour was regulated with care to conciliate the affection of the clergy the senate and the people of Rome The clergy was edified by his frequent visits and liberal gifts to the shrines of the apostles The senate who in the triumphal procession had been excused from the humiliating ceremony of preceding on foot the Imperial chariot was treated with the decent reverence which Stilicho always affected for that assembly The people was repeatedly gratified by the attention and courtesy of Honorius in the public games which were celebrated on that occasion with a magnificence not unworthy of the spectator As soon as the appointed number of chariotraces was concluded the decoration of the Circus was suddenly changed the hunting of wild beasts afforded a various and splendid entertainment and the chace was succeeded by a military dance which seems in the lively description of Claudian to present the image of a modern tournament  In these games of Honorius the inhuman combats  The gladiators abolished  of gladiators

degraded a civilised nation below the condition of savage cannibals Several hundred perhaps several thousand victims were annually slaughtered in the great cities of the empire and the month of December more peculiarly devoted to the combats of gladiators still exhibited to the eyes of the Roman people a grateful spectacle of blood and cruelty Amidst the general joy of the victory of Pollentia a Christian poet exhorted the emperor to extirpate by his authority the horrid custom which had so long resisted the voice of humanity and religion  See the peroration of Prudentius in Symmach l ii who had doubtless read the eloquent invective of Lactantius Divin Institut l vi c The Christian apologists have not spared these bloody games which were introduced in the religious festivals of Paganism  The pathetic representations of Prudentius were less effectual than the generous boldness of Telemachus an Asiatic monk whose death was more useful to mankind than his life  Theodoret l v c I wish to believe the story of St Telemachus Yet no church has been dedicated no altar has been erected to the only monk who died a martyr in the cause of humanity  The Romans were provoked by the interruption of their pleasures and the rash monk who had descended into the arena to separate the gladiators was overwhelmed under a shower of stones But the madness of the people  soon subsided they respected the memory of Telemachus who had deserved the honours of martyrdom and they submitted without a murmur to the laws of Honorius which abolished for ever the human sacrifices of the amphitheatre The citizens who adhered to the manners of their ancestors might perhaps insinuate that the last remains of a martial spirit were preserved in this school of fortitude which accustomed the Romans to the sight of blood and to the contempt of death a vain and cruel prejudice so nobly confuted by the valour of ancient Greece and of modern Europe  Crudele gladiatorum

who had observed the opportunity of the place prepared at the distance of three miles from the old town a capacious harbour for the reception of two hundred and fifty ships of war This naval establishment which included the arsenals and magazines the barracks of the troops and the houses of the artificers derived its origin and name from the permanent station of the Roman fleet the intermediate space was soon filled with buildings and inhabitants and the three extensive and populous quarters of Ravenna gradually contributed to form one of the most important cities of Italy The principal canal of Augustus poured a copious stream of the waters of the Po through the midst of the city to the entrance of the harbour the same waters were introduced into the profound ditches that encompassed the walls they were distributed by a thousand subordinate canals into every part of the city which they divided into a variety of small islands the communication was maintained only by the use of boats and bridges and the houses of Ravenna whose appearance may be compared to that of Venice were raised on the foundation of wooden piles The adjacent country to the distance of many miles was a deep and impassable morass and the artificial causeway which connected Ravenna with the continent might be easily guarded or destroyed on the approach of an hostile army These morasses were interspersed however with vineyards and though the soil was exhausted by four or five crops the town enjoyed  a more plentiful supply of wine than of fresh water  Martial epigram iii plays on the trick of the knave who had sold him wine instead of water but he seriously declares that a cistern at Ravenna is more valuable than a vineyard Sidonius complains that the town is destitute of fountains and aqueducts and ranks the want of fresh water among the local evils such as the croaking of frogs the stinging of gnats c  The air instead of receiving the sickly and almost pestilential exhalations of low and marshy grounds was distinguished like the neighbourhood of Alexandria as uncommonly pure and salubrious and this singular advantage was ascribed to the regular tides of the Hadriatic which swept the canals interrupted the unwholesome stagnation of the waters and floated every day the vessels of the adjacent country into the heart of Ravenna The gradual retreat of the sea has left the modern city at the distance of four miles from the Hadriatic and as early as the fifth or sixth century of the Christian aera the port of Augustus was converted into pleasant orchards and a lonely grove of pines covered the ground where the Roman fleet once rode at anchor  The fable of Theodore and Honoria which Dryden has so admirably transplanted from Bocaccio Giornata iii novell viii was acted in the wood of  Chiassi  a corrupt word from  Classis  the naval station which with the intermediate road or suburb the  Via Caesaris  constituted the  triple  city of Ravenna  Even this alteration contributed to encrease the natural strength of the place and the shallowness of the water was a sufficient barrier against the large ships of the enemy This advantageous situation was fortified by art and labour and in the twentieth year of his age the emperor of the  West anxious only for his personal safety retired to the perpetual confinement of the walls and morasses of Ravenna The example of Honorius was imitated by his feeble successors the Gothic kings and afterwards the Exarchs who occupied the throne and palace of the emperors and till the middle of the eighth century Ravenna was considered as the seat of government and the capital of Italy  From the year the dates of the Theodosian Code become sedentary at Constantinople and Ravenna See Godefroy's Chronology of

the Goths a furious tempest was excited among the nations of Germany who yielded to the irresistible impulse that appears to have been gradually communicated from the eastern extremity of the continent of Asia The Chinese annals as they have been interpreted by the learned industry of the present age may be usefully applied to reveal the secret and remote causes of the fall of the Roman empire The extensive territory to the north of the great wall was possessed after the flight of the Huns by the victorious Sienpi who were sometimes broken into independent tribes and sometimes reunited under a supreme chief till at length styling themselves  Topa  or masters of the earth they acquired a more solid consistence and a more formidable power The Topa soon compelled the pastoral nations of the eastern desert to acknowledge the superiority of  their arms they invaded China in a period of weakness and intestine discord and these fortunate Tartars adopting the laws and manners of the vanquished people founded an Imperial dynasty which reigned near one hundred and sixty years over the northern provinces of the monarchy Some generations before they ascended the throne of China one of the Topa princes had enlisted in his cavalry a slave of the name of Moko renowned for his valour but who was tempted by the fear of punishment to desert his standard and to range the desert at the head of an hundred followers This gang of robbers and outlaws swelled into a camp a tribe a numerous people distinguished by the appellation of  Geougen  and their hereditary chieftains the posterity of Moko the slave assumed their rank among the Scythian monarchs The youth of Toulun the greatest of his descendants was exercised by those misfortunes which are the school of heroes He bravely struggled with adversity broke the imperious yoke of the Topa and became the legislator of his nation and the conqueror of Tartary His troops were distributed into regular bands of an hundred and of a thousand men cowards were stoned to death the most splendid honours were proposed as the reward of valour and Toulun who had knowledge enough to despise the learning of China adopted only such arts and institutions as were favourable to the military spirit of his government His tents which he removed in the winter season to a more southern latitude were  pitched during the summer on the fruitful banks of the Selinga His conquests stretched from Corea far beyond the river Irtish He vanquished in the country to the North of the Caspian sea the nation of the  Huns  and the new title

Yet the temper of the Barbarians and the experience of successive emigrations sufficiently declare that the Huns who were oppressed by the arms of the Geougen soon withdrew from the presence of an insulting victor The countries towards the Euxine were already occupied by their kindred tribes and their hasty flight which they soon converted into a bold attack would more naturally be directed

whose firmness checked and delayed the unskilful fury of the Barbarians The senate and people trembled at their approach within an hundred and  eighty miles of Rome and anxiously compared the danger which they had escaped with the new perils to which they were exposed Alaric was a Christian and a soldier the leader of a disciplined army who understood the laws of war who respected the sanctity of treaties and who had familiarly conversed with the subjects of the empire in the same camps and the same churches The savage Radagaisus was a stranger to the manners the religion and even the language of the civilised nations of the South The fierceness of his temper was exasperated by cruel superstition and it was universally believed that he had bound himself by a solemn vow to reduce the city into  and threatens Rome  a heap of stones and ashes and to sacrifice the most illustrious of the Roman senators on the altars of those gods who were appeased by human blood The public danger which should have reconciled all domestic animosities displayed the incurable madness of religious faction The oppressed votaries of Jupiter and Mercury respected in the implacable enemy of Rome the character of a devout Pagan loudly declared that they were more apprehensive of the sacrifices than of the arms of Radagaisus and secretly rejoiced in the calamities of their country which condemned the faith of their Christian adversaries  Yet the Jupiter of Radagaisus who worshipped Thor and Woden was very different from the Olympic or Capitoline Jove The accommodating temper of Polytheism

for the grave of the Barbarian host The apparent contradictions of those writers who variously relate the defeat of Radagaisus may be reconciled without offering much violence to their respective testimonies Orosius and Augustin who were intimately connected by friendship and religion ascribe this miraculous victory to the providence of God rather than to the valour of man  Augustin de Civitat Dei v Orosius l vii c p The two friends wrote in Africa ten or twelve years after the victory and their authority is implicitly followed by Isidore of Seville in Chron p edit Grot How many interesting facts might Orosius have inserted in the vacant space which is devoted to pious nonsense  They strictly exclude every idea of chance or even of bloodshed and positively affirm that the Romans whose camp was the scene of plenty and idleness enjoyed the distress of the Barbarians slowly expiring on the sharp and barren ridge of the hills of Faesulae which rise above the city of Florence Their extravagant assertion that not a single soldier of the Christian army was killed or even wounded may  be dismissed with silent contempt but the rest of the narrative of Augustin and Orosius is consistent with the state of the war and the character of Stilicho Conscious that he commanded the  last  army of the republic his prudence would not expose it in the open field to the headstrong fury of the Germans The method of surrounding the enemy with strong lines of circumvallation which he had twice employed against the Gothic king was repeated on a larger scale and with more considerable effect The examples of Caesar must have been familiar to the most illiterate of the Roman warriors and the fortifications of Dyrrachium which connected twentyfour castles by a perpetual ditch and rampart of fifteen miles afforded the model of an intrenchment which might confine and starve the most numerous host of Barbarians  Franguntur montes planumque per ardua Caesar  Ducit opus pandit

but the Romans were exposed during the progress of such an extensive work to the frequent attacks of an impatient enemy The despair of the hungry Barbarians would precipitate them against the fortifications of Stilicho the general might sometimes indulge the ardour of his brave auxiliaries who eagerly pressed to assault the camp of the Germans and these various incidents might produce the sharp and bloody conflicts which dignify the narrative of Zosimus and the Chronicles of Prosper and Marcellinus  See Zosimus l v p and the chronicles of Prosper and Marcellinus  A seasonable supply of men and provisions had been introduced into the walls of Florence and the famished host of Radagaisus was in its turn besieged The proud monarch of so many warlike nations after the loss of his bravest warriors was reduced to confide either in the faith of a capitulation or in the clemency of Stilicho  Olympiodorus apud Photium p uses an expression  which would denote a strict and friendly alliance and render Stilicho still more criminal The paulisper detentus deinde interfectus of Orosius is sufficiently odious  But the death of the royal captive who was ignominiously beheaded disgraced the triumph of Rome and of Christianity and the short delay of his execution was sufficient to brand the conqueror with the guilt of cool and  deliberate cruelty  Orosius piously inhuman sacrifices the king and people Agag and the Amalekites without a symptom of compassion The bloody actor is less detestable than the cool unfeeling historian  The famished Germans who escaped the fury of the auxiliaries were sold as slaves at the contemptible price of as many single pieces of gold but the difference of food and climate swept away great numbers of those unhappy strangers and it was observed that the inhuman purchasers instead of reaping the fruits of their labour were soon obliged to provide the expence of their interment Stilicho informed the emperor and the senate of his success and deserved a second time the glorious title of Deliverer of Italy  And Claudian's muse was she asleep had she been ill paid Methinks the seventh consulship of Honorius A D would have

of Rome    The fame of the victory and more especially  The remainder of the Germans invade Gaul A D Dec  of the miracle has encouraged a vain persuasion that the whole army or rather nation of Germans who migrated from the shores of the Baltic miserably perished under the walls of Florence Such indeed was the fate of Radagaisus himself of his brave and faithful companions and of more than onethird of the various multitude of Sueves and Vandals of Alani and Burgundians who adhered to the standard of their general  A luminous passage of Prosper's Chronicle  "In tres partes per diversos principes divisus exercitus"  reduces the miracle of Florence and connects the history of Italy Gaul and Germany  The union of such an army might excite our surprise  but the causes of separation are obvious and forcible the pride of birth the insolence of valour the jealousy of command the impatience of subordination and the obstinate conflict of opinions of interests and of passions among so many kings and warriors who were untaught to yield or to obey After the defeat of Radagaisus two parts of the German host which must have exceeded the number of one hundred thousand men still remained in arms between the Apennine and the Alps or between the Alps and the Danube It is uncertain whether they attempted to revenge the death of their general but their irregular fury was soon diverted by the prudence and firmness of Stilicho who opposed their march and facilitated their retreat who considered the safety of Rome and Italy as the great object of his care and who sacrificed with too much indifference the wealth and tranquillity of the distant provinces  Orosius and Jerom positively charge him with instigating the invasion "Excitatae a Stilichone gentes" c They must mean  indirectly  He saved Italy at the expence of Gaul  The Barbarians acquired from the junction of some Pannonian deserters the knowledge of the country and of the roads and the invasion of Gaul which Alaric had designed was executed by the remains of the great army of Radagaisus  The Count de Buat is satisfied that the Germans who invaded Gaul were the  twothirds  that yet remained of the army of Radagaisus See the Histoire Ancienne des Peuples de l'Europe tom vii p Paris an elaborate work which I had not the advantage of perusing till the year As early as I find the same idea expressed in a rough draught of the present History I have since observed a similar intimation in Mascou viii Such agreement without mutual communication may add some weight to our common sentiment    Yet if they expected to derive any assistance from the tribes of Germany who inhabited the banks of the Rhine their hopes were disappointed The Alemanni preserved a state of inactive neutrality and the Franks distinguished their zeal and courage in the defence of the empire In the rapid progress down the Rhine which was the first act of the administration of Stilicho he had applied himself with peculiar attention to secure the alliance of the warlike Franks and to remove the irreconcileable enemies of peace and of the republic Marcomir one of their kings was publicly convicted before the tribunal of the Roman magistrate of violating the faith of treaties He was sentenced to a mild but distant exile in the province of Tuscany and this degradation of the regal dignity was so far from exciting the resentment of his subjects that they punished with death the turbulent Sunno who attempted to revenge his brother and maintained a dutiful allegiance to the princes who were established on the throne by the choice of Stilicho  Provincia missos  Expellet citius fasces quam Francia reges  Quos dederis  Claudian Cons Stil l i c is clear and satisfactory These kings of France are unknown to Gregory of Tours but the author of the Gesta Francorum mentions both Sunno and Marcomir and names the latter as the father of Pharamond in tom ii p He seems to write from good materials which he did not understand  When the limits of Gaul and Germany  were shaken by the northern emigration the Franks bravely encountered the single force of the Vandals who regardless of the lessons of adversity had again separated their troops from the standard of their Barbarian allies They paid the penalty of their rashness and twenty thousand Vandals with their king Godigisclus were slain in the field of battle The whole people must have been extirpated if the squadrons of the Alani advancing to their relief had not trampled down the infantry of the Franks who after an honourable resistance were compelled to relinquish the unequal contest The victorious confederates pursued their march and on the last day of the year in a season when the waters of the Rhine were most probably frozen they entered without opposition the defenceless provinces of Gaul This memorable passage of the Suevi the Vandals the Alani and the Burgundians who never afterwards retreated may be considered as the fall of the Roman empire in the countries beyond the Alps and the barriers which had so long separated the savage and the civilised nations of the earth were from that fatal moment levelled with the ground

situated the territory of the Romans  Geminasque viator  Cum videat ripas quae sit Romana requirat  This scene of peace and plenty was suddenly changed into a desert and the prospect of the smoking

banks of the Rhine over the greatest part of the seventeen provinces of Gual That rich  and extensive country as far as the ocean the Alps and the Pyrenees was delivered to the Barbarians who drove

extracts from the Carmen de Providentiâ Divinâ and Salvian The anonymous poet was himself a captive with his bishop and fellowcitizens  The ecclesiastics to whom we are indebted for this vague description of the public calamities embraced the opportunity of exhorting the Christians to repent of the sins which had provoked the Divine Justice and to renounce the perishable goods of a wretched and deceitful world But as the Pelagian controversy  The Pelagian doctrine which was first agitated A D was condemned in the space of ten years at Rome and Carthage St Augustin fought and conquered but the Greek church was favourable to his adversaries and what is singular enough the people did not take any part in a dispute which they could not understand  which attempts to sound the abyss of grace and predestination soon became the serious employment of the Latin clergy the Providence which had decreed or foreseen or permitted such a train of moral and natural evils was rashly weighed in the imperfect and fallacious balance of reason The crimes and the misfortunes of the suffering people were presumptuously compared with those of their ancestors and they arraigned the Divine Justice which did not exempt from the common destruction the feeble the guiltless the infant portion of the human species These idle  disputants overlooked the invariable laws of nature which have connected peace with innocence plenty with industry and safety with valour The timid and selfish policy of the court of Ravenna might recal the Palatine legions for the protection of Italy the remains of the stationary troops might be unequal to the arduous task and the Barbarian auxiliaries might prefer the unbounded licence of spoil to the benefits of a moderate and regular stipend But the provinces of Gaul were filled with a numerous race of hardy and robust youth who in the defence of their houses their families and their altars if they had dared to die would have deserved to vanquish The knowledge of their native country would have enabled them to oppose continual and insuperable obstacles to the progress of an invader and the deficiency of the Barbarians in arms as well as in discipline removed the only pretence which excuses the submission of a populous country to the inferior numbers of a veteran army When France was invaded by Charles the Fifth he enquired of a prisoner how many  days  Paris might be distant from the frontier  Perhaps  twelve  but they will be days of battle  See the Memoires de Guillaume du Bellay l vi In French the original reproof is less obvious and more pointed from the double sense of the word  journée  which alike signifies a day's travel or a battle  "  such was the gallant answer which checked the arrogance of that ambitious prince The subjects of Honorius and those of Francis I were animated by a very different spirit and in less than two years  the divided troops of the savages of the Baltic whose numbers were they fairly stated would appear contemptible advanced without a combat to the foot of the Pyrenaean mountains  In the early part of the reign of Honorius the vigilance of Stilicho had successfully guarded the  Revolt of

captive Usher Antiquit Eccles Britann p and Tillemont Mem Eccles tom xvi p c  But those restless Barbarians could not neglect the fair opportunity of the Gothic war when the walls and stations of the province were stripped of the Roman troops If any of the legionaries were permitted to return from the Italian expedition their faithful report of the court and character of Honorius must have tended to dissolve the bonds of allegiance and to exasperate the seditious temper of the British army The spirit of revolt which had formerly disturbed the age of Gallienus was revived by the capricious violence of the soldiers and the unfortunate perhaps the ambitious candidates who were the objects of their choice were the instruments and at length the victims of their passion  The British usurpers are taken from Zosimus l vi p Orosius l vii c p Olympiodorus apud Photium p the ecclesiastical historians and the Chronicles The Latins are ignorant of Marcus  Marcus  was the first whom they placed on the throne as the lawful emperor of Britain and of the West They violated by the hasty murder of Marcus the oath of fidelity which they had imposed on themselves and  their  disapprobation of his manners may seem to inscribe an honourable epitaph on his tomb Gratian was the next whom they adorned with the diadem and the purple and at the end of four months Gratian experienced the fate of his predecessor The memory of the great Constantine whom the British legions had given to the church and to the empire suggested the singular motive of their third choice They  Constantine is acknowledged in Britain and Gaul A D  discovered in the ranks a private soldier of the name of Constantine and their impetuous levity had already seated him on the throne before they perceived his incapacity to sustain the weight of that glorious appellation  Cum in Constantino  inconstantiam  execrarentur Sidonius Apollinaris l v epist p edit secund Sirmond Yet Sidonius might be tempted by so fair a pun to stigmatise a prince who had disgraced his grandfather  Yet the authority of Constantine was less precarious and his government was more successful than the transient reigns of Marcus and of Gratian The danger of leaving his inactive troops in those camps which had been twice polluted with blood and sedition urged him to attempt the reduction of the Western provinces He landed at Boulogne with an inconsiderable force and after he had reposed himself some days he summoned the cities  of Gaul which had escaped the yoke of the Barbarians to acknowledge their lawful sovereign They obeyed the summons without reluctance The neglect of the court of Ravenna had absolved a deserted people from the duty of allegiance their actual distress encouraged them to accept any circumstances of change without apprehension and perhaps with some degree of hope and they might flatter themselves that the troops the authority and even the name of a Roman emperor who fixed his residence in Gaul would protect the unhappy country from the rage of the Barbarians The first successes of Constantine against the detached parties of the Germans were magnified by the voice of adulation into splendid and decisive victories which the reunion and insolence of the enemy soon reduced to their just value His negociations procured a short and precarious truce and if some tribes of the Barbarians were engaged by the liberality of his gifts and promises to undertake the defence of the Rhine these expensive and uncertain treaties instead of restoring the pristine vigour of the Gallic frontier served only to disgrace the majesty of the prince and to exhaust what yet remained of the treasures of the republic Elated however with this imaginary triumph the vain deliverer of Gaul advanced into the provinces of the South to encounter a more pressing and personal danger Sarus the Goth was ordered to lay the head of the rebel at the feet of the emperor Honorius and the forces of Britain and Italy were unworthily consumed in this domestic quarrel  After the loss of his two bravest generals Justinian and Nevigastes the former of whom was slain in the field of battle the latter in a peaceful but treacherous interview Constantine fortified himself within the walls of Vienna The place was ineffectually attacked seven days and the Imperial army supported in a precipitate retreat the ignominy of

i p and this History vol ii p We shall hear of them again  Those mountains now separated the dominions of two rival monarchs and the fortifications of the double frontier were guarded by the troops of the empire whose arms would have been more usefully employed to maintain the Roman limits against the Barbarians of Germany and Scythia  On the side of the Pyrenees the ambition of  He reduces Spain A D  Constantine might be justified by the proximity of danger but his throne was soon established by the conquest or rather submission of Spain which yielded to the influence of regular and habitual subordination and received the laws and magistrates of the Gallic praefecture The only opposition which was made to the authority of Constantine proceeded not so much from the powers of government or the spirit of the people as from the private zeal and interest of the family of Theodosius Four brothers  Verinianus Didymus Theodosius and Lagodius who in modern courts would be styled princes of the blood were not distinguished by any rank or privileges above the rest of their fellowsubjects  had obtained  by the favour of their kinsman the deceased emperor an honourable rank and ample possessions in their native country and the grateful youths resolved to risk those advantages in the service of his son After an unsuccessful effort to maintain their ground at the head of the stationary troops of Lusitania they retired to their estates where they armed and levied at their own expence a considerable body of slaves and dependents and boldly marched to occupy the strong posts of the Pyrenaean mountains This domestic insurrection alarmed and perplexed the sovereign of Gaul and Britain and he was compelled to negociate with some troops of Barbarian auxiliaries for the service of the Spanish war They were distinguished by the title of  Honorians  These  Honoriani  or  Honoriaci  consisted of two bands of Scots or Attacotti two of Moors two of Marcomanni the Victores the Ascarii and the Gallicani Notitia Imperii sect xxxviii edit Lab They were part of the sixtyfive  Auxilia Palatina  and are properly styled  by Zosimus l vi p  a name which might have reminded them of their fidelity to their lawful sovereign and if it should candidly be allowed that the  Scots  were influenced by any partial affection for a British prince the  Moors  and the  Marcomanni  could be tempted only by the profuse liberality of the usurper who distributed among the Barbarians the military and even the civil honours of Spain The nine bands of  Honorians  which may be easily traced on the establishment of the Western empire could not exceed the number of five thousand  men yet this inconsiderable force was sufficient to terminate a war which had threatened the power and safety of Constantine The rustic army of the Theodosian family was surrounded and destroyed in the Pyrenees two of the brothers had the good fortune to escape by sea to Italy or the East the other two after an interval of suspence were executed at Arles and if Honorius could remain insensible of the public disgrace he might perhaps be affected by the personal misfortunes of his generous kinsmen Such were the feeble arms which decided the possession of the Western provinces of Europe from the wall of Antoninus to the columns of Hercules The events of peace and war have undoubtedly been diminished by the narrow and imperfect view of the historians of the times who were equally ignorant of the causes and of the effects of the most important revolutions But the total decay of the national strength had annihilated even the last resource of a despotic government and the revenue of exhausted provinces could no longer purchase the military service of a discontented and pusillanimous people  The poet whose flattery has ascribed to the  Negociation of Alaric and Stilicho A D  Roman eagle the victories of Pollentia and Verona pursues the hasty retreat of Alaric from the confines of Italy with a horrid train of imaginary spectres such as might hover over an army of Barbarians which was almost exterminated by war famine and disease  Comitatur euntem  Pallor et atra fames et saucia lividus ora  Luctus et inferni stridentes agmine morbi  Claudian in vi Cons Hon c  In the course of  this unfortunate expedition the king of the Goths must indeed have sustained a considerable loss and his harassed forces required an interval of repose to recruit their numbers and revive their confidence Adversity had exercised and displayed the genius of Alaric and the fame of his valour invited to the Gothic standard the bravest of the Barbarian warriors who from the Euxine to the Rhine were agitated by the desire of rapine and conquest He had deserved the esteem and he soon accepted the friendship of Stilicho himself Renouncing the service of the emperor of the East Alaric concluded with the court of Ravenna a treaty of peace and alliance by which he was declared mastergeneral of the Roman armies throughout the praefecture of Illyricum as it was claimed according to the true and ancient limits by the minister of Honorius  These dark transactions are investigated by the Count de Buat Hist des Peuples de l'Europe tom vii c iiiviii p whose laborious accuracy may sometimes fatigue a superficial reader  The execution of the ambitious design which was either stipulated or implied in the articles of the treaty appears to have been suspended by the formidable irruption of Radagaisus and the neutrality of the Gothic king may perhaps be compared to the indifference of Caesar who in the conspiracy of Catiline refused either to assist or to oppose the enemy of the republic After the defeat of the Vandals Stilicho resumed his pretensions to the provinces of the East appointed civil magistrates for the administration of justice  and of the finances and declared his impatience to lead to the gates of Constantinople the united armies of the Romans and of the Goths The prudence however of Stilicho his aversion to civil war and his perfect knowledge of the weakness of the state may countenance the suspicion that domestic peace rather than foreign conquest was the object of his policy and that his principal care was to employ the forces of Alaric at a distance from Italy This design could not long escape the penetration of the Gothic king who continued to hold a doubtful and perhaps a treacherous correspondence with the rival courts who protracted like a dissatisfied mercenary his languid operations in Thessaly and Epirus and who soon returned to claim the extravagant reward of his ineffectual services From his camp near Aemona  See Zosimus l v p He interrupts his scanty narrative to relate the fable of Aemona and of the ship Argo which was drawn over land from

emperor of the West a long account of promises of expences and of demands called for immediate satisfaction and clearly intimated the consequences of a refusal Yet if his conduct was hostile his language was decent and dutiful He humbly professed himself the friend of Stilicho and the soldier of Honorius offered his person and his troops to march without delay against the usurper of  Gaul and solicited as a permanent retreat for the Gothic nation the possession of some vacant province of the Western empire  The political and secret transactions of two statesmen who laboured to deceive each other  Debates of the Roman senate A D  and the world must for ever have been concealed in the impenetrable darkness of the cabinet if the debates of a popular assembly had not thrown some rays of light on the correspondence of Alaric and Stilicho The necessity of finding some artificial support for a government which from a principle not of moderation but of weakness was reduced to negociate with its own subjects had insensibly revived the authority of the Roman senate and the minister of Honorius respectfully consulted the legislative council of the republic Stilicho assembled the senate in the palace of the Caesars represented in a studied oration the actual state of affairs proposed the demands of the Gothic king and submitted to their consideration the choice of peace or war The senators as if they had been suddenly awakened from a dream of four hundred years appeared on this important occasion to be inspired by the courage rather than by the wisdom of their predecessors They loudly declared in regular speeches or in tumultuary acclamations that it was unworthy of the majesty of Rome to purchase a precarious and disgraceful truce from a Barbarian king and that in the judgment of a magnanimous people the chance of ruin was always preferable to the certainty of dishonour The minister  whose pacific intentions were seconded only by the voices of a few servile and venal followers attempted to allay the general ferment by an apology for his own conduct and even for the demands of the Gothic prince  "The payment of a subsidy which had excited the indignation of the Romans ought not such was the language of Stilicho to be considered in the odious light either of a tribute or of a ransom extorted by the menaces of a Barbarian enemy Alaric had faithfully asserted the just pretensions of the republic to the provinces which were usurped by the Greeks of Constantinople he modestly required the fair and stipulated recompence of his services and if he had desisted from the prosecution of his enterprise he had obeyed in his retreat the peremptory though private letters of the emperor himself These contradictory orders he would not dissemble the errors of his own family had been procured by the intercession of Serena The tender piety of his wife had been too deeply affected by the discord of the royal brothers the sons of her adopted father and the sentiments of nature had too easily prevailed over the stern dictates of the public welfare"  These ostensible reasons which faintly disguise the obscure intrigues of the palace of Ravenna were supported by the authority of Stilicho and obtained after a warm debate the reluctant approbation of the senate The tumult of virtue and freedom subsided and the sum of four thousand pounds of gold was granted under the name of  a subsidy to secure the peace of Italy and to conciliate the friendship of the king of the Goths Lampadius alone one of the most illustrious members of the assembly still persisted in his dissent exclaimed with a loud voice  "This is not a treaty of peace but of servitude  Zosimus l v p He repeats the words of Lampadius as they were spoke in Latin "Non est ista pax sed pactio servitutis" and then translates them into Greek for the benefit of his readers  "  and escaped the danger of such bold opposition by immediately retiring to the sanctuary of a Christian church  But the reign of Stilicho drew towards its end and the proud minister might perceive the symptoms  Intrigues of the palace A D May  of his approaching disgrace The generous boldness of Lampadius had been applauded and the senate so patiently resigned to a long servitude rejected with disdain the offer of invidious and imaginary freedom The troops who still assumed the name and prerogatives of the Roman legions were exasperated by the partial affection of Stilicho for the Barbarians and the people imputed to the mischievous policy of the minister the public misfortunes which were the natural consequence of their own degeneracy Yet Stilicho might have continued to brave the clamours of the people and even of the soldiers if he could have maintained his dominion over the feeble mind of his pupil But the respectful attachment of Honorius was converted into fear suspicion and hatred The crafty Olympius  He came from the coast of the Euxine and exercised a splendid office  His actions justify his character which Zosimus l v p exposes with visible satisfaction Augustin revered the piety of Olympius whom he styles a true son of the church Baronius Annal Eccles A D No c Tillemont Mem Eccles tom xiii p But these praises which the African saint so unworthily bestows might proceed as well from ignorance as from adulation  who concealed  his vices under the mask of Christian piety had secretly undermined the benefactor by whose favour he was promoted to the honourable offices of the Imperial palace Olympius revealed to the unsuspecting emperor who had attained the twentyfifth year of his age that he was without weight or authority in his own government and artfully alarmed his timid and indolent disposition by a lively picture of the designs of Stilicho who already meditated the death of his sovereign with the ambitious hope of placing the diadem on the head of his son Eucherius The emperor was instigated by his new favourite to assume the tone of independent dignity and the minister was astonished to find that secret resolutions were formed in the court and council which were repugnant to his interest or to his intentions Instead of residing in the palace of Rome Honorius declared that it was his pleasure to return to the secure fortress of Ravenna On the first intelligence of the death of his brother Arcadius he prepared to visit Constantinople and to regulate with the authority of a guardian the provinces of the infant Theodosius  Zosimus l v p Sozomen l ix c Stilicho offered to undertake the journey to Constantinople that he might divert Honorius from the vain attempt The Eastern empire would not have obeyed and could not have been conquered  The  representation of the difficulty and expence of such a distant expedition checked this strange and sudden sally of active diligence but the dangerous project of shewing the emperor to the camp of Pavia which was composed of the Roman troops the enemies of Stilicho and his Barbarian auxiliaries remained fixed and unalterable The minister was pressed by the advice of his confident Justinian a Roman advocate of a lively and penetrating genius to oppose a journey so prejudicial to his reputation and safety His strenuous but ineffectual efforts confirmed the triumph of Olympius and the prudent lawyer withdrew himself from the impending ruin of his patron  In the passage of the emperor through Bologna  Disgrace and death of Stilicho A D Aug  a mutiny of the guards was excited and appeased by the secret policy of Stilicho who announced his instructions to decimate the guilty and ascribed to his own intercession the merit of their pardon After this tumult Honorius embraced for the last time the minister whom he now considered as a tyrant and proceeded on his way to camp of Pavia where he was received by the loyal acclamations of the troops who were assembled for the service of the Gallic war On the morning of the fourth day he pronounced as he had been taught a military oration in the presence of the soldiers whom the charitable visits and artful discourses of Olympius had prepared to execute a dark and bloody conspiracy At the first signal they massacred the friends of Stilicho the most illustrious officers of the empire  two Praetorian praefects of Gaul and of Italy two mastersgeneral of the cavalry and infantry the master of the offices the quaestor the treasurer and the count of the domestics Many lives were lost many houses were plundered the furious sedition continued to rage till the close of the evening and the trembling emperor who was seen in the streets of Pavia without his robes or diadem yielded to the persuasions of his favourite condemned the memory of the slain and solemnly approved the innocence and fidelity of their assassins The intelligence of the massacre of Pavia filled the mind of Stilicho with just and gloomy apprehensions and he instantly summoned in the camp of Bologna a council of the confederate leaders who were attached to his service and would be involved in his ruin The impetuous voice of the assembly called aloud for arms and for revenge to march without a moment's delay under the banners of a hero whom they had so often followed to victory to surprise to oppress to extirpate the guilty Olympius and his degenerate Romans and perhaps to fix the diadem on the head of their injured general Instead of executing a resolution which might have been justified by success Stilicho hesitated till he was irrecoverably lost He was still ignorant of the fate of the emperor he distrusted the fidelity of his own party and he viewed with horror the fatal consequences of arming a crowd of licentious Barbarians against the soldiers and people of Italy The confederates impatient of  his timorous and doubtful delay hastily retired with fear and indignation At the hour of midnight Sarus a Gothic warrior renowned among the Barbarians themselves for his strength and valour suddenly invaded the camp of his benefactor plundered the baggage cut in pieces the faithful Huns who guarded his person and penetrated to the tent where the minister pensive and sleepless meditated on the dangers of his situation Stilicho escaped with difficulty from the sword of the Goths and after issuing a last and generous admonition to the cities of Italy to shut their gates against the Barbarians his confidence or his despair urged him to throw himself into Ravenna which was already in the absolute possession of his enemies Olympius who had assumed the dominion of Honorius was speedily informed that his rival had embraced as a suppliant the altar of the Christian church The base and cruel disposition of the hypocrite was incapable of pity or remorse but he piously affected to elude rather than to violate the privilege of the sanctuary Count Heraclian with a troop of soldiers appeared at the dawn of day before the gates of the church of Ravenna The bishop was satisfied by a solemn oath that the Imperial mandate only directed them to secure the person of Stilicho but as soon as the unfortunate minister had been tempted beyond the holy threshold he produced the warrant for his instant execution Stilicho supported with calm resignation the injurious names of traitor and  parricide repressed the unseasonable zeal of his followers who were ready to attempt an ineffectual rescue and with a firmness not unworthy of the last of the Roman generals submitted his neck to the sword of Heraclian  Zosimus l v p has copiously though not clearly related the disgrace

notaries Even the religion of Stilicho was arraigned by the malice of his rival The seasonable and almost miraculous deliverance was devoutly celebrated by the applause of the clergy who asserted that the restoration of idols and the persecution of the church would have been the first measure of the reign of Eucherius The son of Stilicho however was educated in the bosom of Christianity which his father had uniformly professed and zealously supported  Augustin himself is satisfied with the effectual laws which Stilicho had enacted against heretics and idolaters and which are still extant in the Code He only applies to Olympius for their consirmation Baronius Annal Eccles A D No  Serena had borrowed her magnificent necklace from the statue of Vesta  Zosimus l v p We may observe the bad taste of the age in dressing their statues with such awkward sinery  and the Pagans execrated the memory of the sacrilegious minister by whose order the Sybilline books the oracles of Rome had been committed to the flames  See Rutilius Numatianus Itinerar l ii to whom religious enthusiasm has dictated some elegant and forcible lines Stilicho likewise stripped the gold plates from the doors of the Capitol and read a prophetic sentence which was engraven under them Zosimus l v p These are foolish stories yet the charge of  impiety  adds weight and credit to the praise which Zosimus reluctantly bestows of his virtues  The pride and power of Stilicho constituted his real guilt An honourable reluctance to shed the blood of his countrymen appears to have contributed to the success of his unworthy rival and it is the last humiliation of the character of Honorius that posterity has not condescended to reproach him with his  base ingratitude to the guardian of his youth and the support of his empire  Among the train of dependents whose wealth  The poet Claudian  and dignity attracted the notice of their own times  our  curiosity is excited by the celebrated name of the poet Claudian who enjoyed the favour of Stilicho and was overwhelmed in the ruin of his patron The titular offices of tribune and notary fixed his rank in the Imperial court he was indebted to the powerful intercession of Serena for his marriage with a very rich heiress of the province of Africa  At the nuptials of Orpheus a modest comparison all the parts of animated nature contributed their various gifts and the gods themselves enriched their favourite Claudian had neither flocks nor herds nor vines or olives His wealthy bride was heiress to them all But he carried to Africa a recommendatory letter from Serena his Juno and was made happy Epist ii ad Serenam  and the statue of Claudian erected in the forum of Trajan was a monument of the taste and liberality of the Roman senate  Claudian feels the honour like a man who deserved it in praefat Bell Get The original inscription on marble was found at Rome in the fifteenth century in the house of Pomponius Laetus The statue of a poet far superior to Claudian should have been erected during his lifetime by the men of letters his countrymen and contemporaries It was a noble design  After the praises of Stilicho became offensive and criminal Claudian was exposed to the enmity of a powerful and unforgiving courtier whom he had provoked by the insolence of wit He had compared in a lively epigram the opposite characters of two Praetorian praefects of Italy he contrasts the innocent repose of a philosopher who sometimes resigned the hours of business to  slumber perhaps to study with the interested diligence of a rapacious minister indefatigable in the pursuit of unjust or sacrilegious gain  "How happy continues Claudian how happy might it be for the people of Italy if Mallius could be constantly awake and if Hadrian would always sleep  See Epigram xxx  Mallius indulget somno noctesque diesque  Insomnis  Pharius  sacra profana rapit  Omnibus hoc Italae gentes exposcite votis  Mallius ut vigilet dormiat ut Pharius  Hadrian was a Pharian of Alexandria See his public life in Godefroy Cod Theodos tom vi p Mallius did not always sleep He composed some elegant dialogues on the Greek systems of natural philosophy Claud in Mall Theodor Cons  "  The repose of Mallius was not disturbed by this friendly and gentle admonition but the cruel vigilance of Hadrian watched the opportunity of revenge and easily obtained from the enemies of Stilicho the trifling sacrifice of an obnoxious poet The poet concealed himself however during the tumult of the revolution and consulting the dictates of prudence rather than of honour he addressed in the form of an epistle a suppliant and humble recantation to the offended praefect He deplores in mournful strains the fatal indiscretion into which he had been hurried by passion and folly submits to the imitation of his adversary the generous examples of the clemency of gods of heroes and of lions and expresses his hope that the magnanimity of Hadrian will not trample on a defenceless and contemptible foe already humbled by disgrace  and poverty and deeply wounded by the exile the tortures and the death of his dearest friends  See Claudian's first Epistle Yet in some places an air of irony and indignation betrays his secret reluctance  Whatever might be the success of his prayer or the accidents of his future life the period of a few years levelled in the grave the minister and the poet but the name of Hadrian is almost sunk in oblivion while Claudian is read with pleasure in every country which has retained or acquired the knowledge of the Latin language If we fairly balance his merits and his defects we shall acknowledge that Claudian does not either satisfy or silence our reason It would not be easy to produce a passage that deserves the epithet of sublime or pathetic to select a verse that melts the heart or enlarges the imagination We should vainly seek in the poems of Claudian the happy invention and artificial conduct of an interesting fable or the just and lively representation of the characters and situations of real life For the service of his patron he published occasional panegyrics and invectives and the design of these slavish compositions encouraged his propensity to exceed the limits of truth and nature These imperfections however are compensated in some degree by the poetical virtues of Claudian He was endowed with the rare and precious talent of raising the meanest of adorning the most barren and of diversifying the most similar topics his colouring more especially in descriptive poetry is soft and splendid and he  seldom fails to display and even to abuse the advantages of a cultivated understanding a copious fancy an easy and sometimes forcible expression and a perpetual flow of harmonious versification To these commendations independent of any accidents of time and place we must add the peculiar merit which Claudian derived from the unfavourable circumstances of his birth In the decline of arts and of empire a native of Egypt  National vanity has made him a Florentine or a Spaniard But the first epistle of Claudian proves him a native of Alexandria Fabricius Bibliot Latin tom

pursued by the ministers of Honorius  The series of events from the death of Stilicho to the arrival of Alaric before Rome can only be found in Zosimus l v p  The king of the Goths would have conspired perhaps with some reluctance to destroy the formidable adversary by whose arms in Italy as well as in Greece he had been twice overthrown  Their  active and interested hatred laboriously accomplished the disgrace and ruin of the great Stilicho The valour of Sarus his fame in arms and his personal or hereditary influence over the confederate Barbarians could recommend him only to the friends of their country who despised or detested the worthless characters of Turpilio Varanes and Vigilantius By the pressing instances of the new  favourites these generals unworthy as they had shewn themselves of the name of soldiers  The expression of Zosimus is strong and lively  sufficient to excite the contempt of the enemy  were promoted to the command of the cavalry of the infantry and of the domestic troops The Gothic prince would have subscribed with pleasure the edict which the fanaticism of Olympius dictated to the simple and devout emperor Honorius excluded all persons who were adverse to the catholic church from holding any office in the state obstinately rejected the service of all those who dissented from his religion and rashly disqualified many of his bravest and most skilful officers who adhered to the Pagan worship or who had imbibed the opinions of Arianism  Eos qui catholicae sectae sunt inimici intra palatium militare prohibemus Nullus nobis sit aliquâ ratione conjunctus qui a nobis fide et religione discordat Cod Theodos l xvi tit v leg and Godefroy's Commentary tom vi p This law was applied in the utmost latitude and rigorously executed Zosimus l v p  These measures so advantageous to an enemy Alaric would have approved and might perhaps have suggested but it may seem doubtful whether the Barbarian would have promoted his interest at the expence of the inhuman and absurd cruelty which was perpetrated by the direction or at least with the connivance of the Imperial ministers The foreign auxiliaries who had been attached to the person of Stilicho lamented his death but the desire of revenge was checked by a natural apprehension for the safety of their  wives and children who were detained as hostages in the strong cities of Italy where they had likewise deposited their most valuable effects At the same hour and as if by a common signal the cities of Italy were polluted by the same horrid scenes of universal massacre and pillage which involved in promiscuous destruction the families and fortunes of the Barbarians Exasperated by such an injury which might have awakened the tamest and most servile spirit they cast a look of indignation and hope towards the camp of Alaric and unanimously swore to pursue with just and implacable war the perfidious nation that had so basely violated the laws of hospitality By the imprudent conduct of the ministers of Honorius the republic lost the assistance and deserved the enmity of thirty thousand of her bravest soldiers and the weight of that formidable army which alone might have determined the event of the war was transferred from the scale of the Romans into that of the Goths  In the arts of negociation as well as in those of war the Gothic king maintained his superior  Alaric marches to Rome A D Oct c  ascendant over an enemy whose seeming changes proceeded from the total want of counsel and design From his camp on the confines of Italy Alaric attentively observed the revolutions of the palace watched the progress of faction and discontent disguised the hostile aspect of a Barbarian invader and assumed the more popular appearance of the friend and ally of the great Stilicho to whose virtues when they were no longer formidable he could pay a just tribute of sincere  praise and regret The pressing invitation of the malcontents who urged the king of the Goths to invade Italy was enforced by a lively sense of his personal injuries and he might speciously complain that the Imperial ministers still delayed and eluded the payment of the four thousand pounds of gold which had been granted by the Roman senate either to reward his services or to appease his fury His decent firmness was supported by an artful moderation which contributed to the success of his designs He required a fair and reasonable satisfaction but he gave the strongest assurances that as soon as he had obtained it he would immediately retire He refused to trust the faith of the Romans unless Aetius and Jason the sons of two great officers of state were sent as hostages to his camp but he offered to deliver in exchange several of the noblest youths of the Gothic nation The modesty of Alaric was interpreted by the ministers of Ravenna as a sure evidence of his weakness and fear They disdained either to negociate a treaty or to assemble an army and with a rash confidence derived only from their ignorance of the extreme danger irretrievably wasted the decisive moments of peace and war While they expected in sullen silence that the Barbarians should evacuate the confines of Italy Alaric with bold and rapid marches passed the Alps and the Po hastily pillaged the cities of Aquileia Altinum Concordia and Cremona which yielded to his arms increased his forces by the accession of thirty thousand  auxiliaries and without meeting a single enemy in the field advanced as far as the edge of the morass which protected the impregnable residence of the emperor of the West Instead of attempting the hopeless siege of Ravenna the prudent leader of the Goths proceeded to Rimini stretched his ravages along the seacoast of the Hadriatic and meditated the conquest of the ancient mistress of the world An Italian hermit whose zeal and sanctity were respected by the Barbarians themselves encountered the victorious monarch and boldly denounced the indignation of heaven against the oppressors of the earth but the saint himself was confounded by the solemn asseveration of Alaric that he felt a secret and praeternatural impulse which directed and even compelled his march to the gates of Rome He felt that his genius and his fortune were equal to the most arduous enterprises and the enthusiasm which he communicated to the Goths insensibly removed the popular and almost superstitious reverence of the nations for the majesty of the Roman name His troops animated by the hopes of spoil followed the course of the Flaminian way occupied the unguarded passes of the Apennine  Addison see his Works vol ii p edit Baskerville has given a very picturesque description of the road through the Apennine The Goths were not at leisure to observe the beauties of the prospect but they were pleased to find that the Saxa Intercisa a narrow passage which Vespasian had cut through the rock Cluver Italia Antiq tom i p was totally neglected  descended into the rich

whose passages may be found in Cluverius and Addision have celebrated the triumphal victims of the Clitumnus  A lofty situation and a seasonable tempest of thunder and lightning preserved the little city of Narni but the king of the Goths despising the ignoble prey still advanced with unabated vigour and after he had passed through the stately arches adorned with the spoils of Barbaric victories he pitched his camp under the walls of Rome  Some ideas of the march of Alaric are borrowed from the journey of Honorius over the same ground See Claudian in vi Cons Hon The measured distance between Ravenna and Rome was Roman miles Itinerar Wesseling p    During a period of six hundred and nineteen  Hannibal at the gates of Rome  years the seat of empire had never been violated by the presence of

display the character of the senate and people of a senate degraded rather than ennobled by the comparison of an assembly of kings and of a people to whom the ambassador of Pyrrhus ascribed the inexhaustible resources of the Hydra  These comparisons were used by Cyneas the counsellor of Pyrrhus after his return from his embassy in which he had diligently studied the discipline and manners of Rome See Plutarch in Pyrrho tom ii p  Each of the senators in the time  of the Punic war had accomplished his term of military service either in a subordinate or a superior station and the decree which invested with temporary command all those who had been consuls or censors or dictators gave the republic the immediate assistance of many brave and experienced generals In the beginning of the war the Roman people consisted of two hundred and fifty thousand citizens of an age to bear arms  In the three  census  which were made of the Roman people about the time of the second Punic war the numbers stand as follows see Livy Epitom l xx Hist l xxvii xxix The fall of the second and the rise of the third appears so enormous that several critics notwithstanding the unanimity of the MSS have suspected some corruption of the text of Livy See Drakenborch ad xxvii and Beaufort Republique Romaine tom i p They did not consider that the second  census  was taken only at Rome and that the numbers were diminished not only by the death but likewise by the  absence  of many soldiers In the third  census  Livy expressly affirms that the legions were mustered by the care of particular commissaries From the numbers on the list we must always deduct one twelfth above threescore and incapable of bearing arms See Population de la France p  Fifty thousand had already died in the defence of their country and the twentythree legions which were employed in the different camps of Italy Greece Sardinia Sicily and Spain required about one hundred thousand men But there still remained an equal number in Rome and the adjacent territory who were animated by the same intrepid courage and every citizen was trained from his earliest youth in the discipline and exercises of a soldier Hannibal was astonished by the constancy of the senate who without  raising the siege of Capua or recalling their scattered forces expected his approach He encamped on the banks of the Anio at the distance of three miles from the city and he was soon informed that the ground on which he had pitched his tent was sold for an adequate price at a public auction and that a body of troops was dismissed by an opposite road to reinforce the legions of Spain  Livy considers these two incidents as the effects only of chance and courage I suspect that they were both managed by the admirable policy of the senate  He led his Africans to the gates of Rome where he found three armies in order of battle prepared to receive him but Hannibal dreaded the event of a combat from which he could not hope to escape unless he destroyed the last of his enemies and his speedy retreat confessed the invincible courage of the Romans  From the time of the Punic war the uninterrupted  Genealogy of tho senators  succession of senators had preserved the name and image of the republic and the degenerate subjects of Honorius ambitiously derived their descent from the heroes who had repulsed the arms of Hannibal and subdued the nations of the earth The temporal honours which the devout Paula  See Jerom tom i p ad Eustochium he bestows on Paula the splendid titles of Gracchorum stirps soboles Scipionum Pauli haeres cujus vocabulum trahit Martiae Papyriae Matris Africani vera et germana propago This particular description supposes a more solid title than the surname of Julius which Toxotius

and the historian of her life The genealogy of her father Rogatus which ascended as high as Agamemnon might seem to betray a Grecian origin but her mother Blaesilla numbered the Scipios Aemilius Paulus and the Gracchi in the list of her ancestors and Toxotius the husband of Paula deduced his royal lineage from Aeneas the father of the Julian line The vanity of the rich who desired to be noble was gratified by these lofty pretensions Encouraged by the applause of their parasites they easily imposed on the credulity of the vulgar and were countenanced in some measure by the custom of adopting the name of their patron which had always prevailed among the freedmen and clients of illustrious families Most of those families however attacked by so many causes of external violence or internal decay were gradually extirpated and it would be more reasonable to seek for a lineal descent of twenty generations among the mountains of the Alps or in the peaceful solitude of Apulia than on the theatre of Rome the seat of fortune of danger and of perpetual revolutions Under each successive reign and from every province of the empire a crowd of hardy adventurers rising to eminence by their talents or their vices usurped the wealth the honours and the palaces of Rome and oppressed or protected the poor and humble remains of consular families who were ignorant perhaps of the glory of their ancestors  Tacitus Annal iii affirms that between the battle of Actium and the reign of Vespasian the senate was gradually filled with  families from the Municipia and colonies of Italy    In the time of Jerom and Claudian the senators unanimously yielded the preeminence to the Anician line and a slight view of  their  history  The Anician family  will serve to appreciate the rank and antiquity of the noble families which contended only for the second place  Nec quisquam Procerum tentet licet aere vetusto  Floreat et claro cingatur Roma senatû  Se jactare parem fed primâ sede relictâ  Aucheniis  de jure licet certare secundo  Claud in Prob et Olybrii Coss  Such a compliment paid to the obscure name of the Auchenii has amazed the critics but they all agree that whatever may be the true reading the sense of Claudian can be applied only to the Anician family  During the five first ages of the city the name of the Anicians was unknown they appear to have derived their origin from Praeneste and the ambition of those new citizens was long satisfied with the Plebeian honours of tribunes of the people  The earliest date in the annals of Pighius is that of M Anicius Gallus Trib Pl A U C Another tribune Q Anicius A U C is distinguished by the epithet of Praenestinus Livy xlv places the Anicii below the great families of Rome  One hundred and sixtyeight years before the Christian aera the family was ennobled by the Praetorship of Anicius who gloriously terminated the Illyrian war by the conquest of the nation and the captivity of their king  Livy xliv xlv He fairly appreciates the merit of Anicius and justly observes that his fame was clouded by the superior lustre of the Macedonian which preceded the Illyrian triumph  From the triumph of that general three consulships in distant periods mark the succession of the Anician name  The dates of the three consulships are A U C the two last under the reigns of Nero and Caracalla The second of these consuls distinguished himself only by his infamous flattery Tacit Annal xv but even the evidence of crimes if they bear the stamp of greatness and antiquity is admitted without reluctance to prove the genealogy of a noble house  From the reign of Diocletian  to the final extinction of the Western empire that name shone with a lustre which was not eclipsed in the public estimation by the majesty of the Imperial purple  In the sixth century the nobility of the Anician name is mentioned Cassiodor Variar l x Ep with singular respect by the minister of a Gothic king of Italy  The several branches to whom it was communicated united by marriage or inheritance the wealth and titles of the Annian the Petronian and the Olybrian houses and in each generation the number of consulships was multiplied by an hereditary claim  Fixus in omnes  Cognatos procedit honos quemcumque requiras  Hâc de stirpe virum certum est de Consule nasci  Per fasces numerantur Avi semperque renatâ  Nobilitate virent et prolem fata sequuntur  Claudian in Prob et Olyb Consulat c The Annii whose name seems to have merged in the Anician mark the Fasti with many consulships from the time of Vespasian to the fourth century  The Anician family excelled in faith and in riches they were the first of the Roman senate who embraced Christianity and it is probable that Anicius Julian who was afterwards consul and praefect of the city atoned for his attachment to the party of Maxentius by the readiness with which he accepted the religion of Constantine  The title of first Christian senator may be justified by the authority of Prudentius in Symmach i and the dislike of the Pagans to the Anician family See Tillemont Hist des Empereurs tom iv p v p Baron Annal A D No A D No  Their ample patrimony was increased by the industry  of Probus the chief of the Anician family who shared with Gratian the honours of the consulship and exercised four times the high office of Praetorian praefect  Probus

 Such was the respect entertained for his memory that the two sons of Probus in their earliest youth and at the request of the senate were associated in the consular dignity a memorable distinction

was besieged by the Goths  This curious account of Rome in the reign of Honorius is found in a fragment of the historian Olympiodorus ap Photium p  continues to observe that several of the richest senators received from their estates an annual income of four thousand pounds of gold above one hundred and sixty thousand pounds sterling without computing the stated provision of corn and wine which had they been sold might have equalled in value one third of  the money Compared to this immoderate wealth an ordinary revenue of a thousand or fifteen hundred pounds of gold might be considered as no more than adequate to the dignity of the senatorian rank which required many expences of a public and ostentatious kind Several examples are recorded in the age of Honorius of vain and popular nobles who celebrated the year of their praetorship by a festival which lasted seven days and cost above one hundred thousand pounds sterling  The sons of Alypius of Symmachus and of Maximus spent during their respective praetorships twelve or twenty or forty  centenaries  or hundred weight of gold See Olympiodor ap Phot p This popular estimation allows some latitude but it is difficult to explain a law in the Theodosian Code l vi leg which fixes the expence of the first praetor at of the second at and of the third at  folles  The name of  follis  see Mem de l'Academie des Inscriptions tom xxviii p was equally applied to a purse of pieces of silver and to a small copper coin of the value of part of that purse In the former sense the folles would be equal to l in the latter to five or six pounds sterling The one appears extravagant the other is ridiculous There must have existed some third and middle value which is here understood but ambiguity is an inexcusable fault in the language of laws  The estates of the Roman senators which so far exceeded the proportion of modern wealth were not confined to the limits of Italy Their possessions extended far beyond the Ionian and Aegean seas to the most distant provinces the city of Nicopolis which Augustus had founded as an eternal monument of the Actian victory was the property of the devout Paula  Nicopolis in Actiaco littore sita possessionis vestrae nunc pars vel maxima est Jerom in praefat Comment ad Epistol ad Titum tom ix p M de Tillemont supposes strangely enough that it was part of Agamemnon's inheritance Mem Eccles tom xii p  and it is  observed by Seneca that the rivers which had divided hostile nations now flowed through the lands of private citizens  Seneca Epist lxxxix His language is of the declamatory kind but declamation could scarcely exaggerate the avarice and luxury of the Romans The philosopher himself deserved some share of the reproach if it be true that his rigorous exaction of  Quadringenties  above three hundred thousand pounds which he had lent at high interest provoked a rebellion in Britain Dion Cassius l lxii p According to the conjecture of Gale Antoninus's Itinerary in Britain p the same Faustinus possessed an estate near Bury in Suffolk and another in the kingdom of Naples  According to their temper and circumstances the estates of the Romans were either cultivated by the labour of their slaves or granted for a certain and stipulated rent to the industrious farmer The oeconomical writers of antiquity strenuously recommend the former method wherever it may be practicable but if the object should be removed by its distance or magnitude from the immediate eye of the master they prefer the active care of an old hereditary tenant attached to the soil and interested in the produce to the mercenary administration of a negligent perhaps an unfaithful steward  Volusius a wealthy senator Tacit Annal iii always preferred tenants born on the estate Columella who received this maxim from him argues very judiciously on the subject De Re Rusticâ l i c p edit Gesner Leipsig    The opulent nobles of an immense capital  Their manners  who were never excited by the pursuit of military glory and seldom engaged in the occupations of civil government naturally resigned their leisure to the business and amusements of private life At Rome commerce was always held in contempt  but the senators from the first age of the republic increased their patrimony and multiplied their clients by the lucrative practice of usury and the obsolete laws were eluded or violated by the mutual inclinations and interest of both parties  Valesius ad Ammian xiv has proved from Chrysostom and Augustin that the senators were not allowed to lend money at usury Yet it appears from the Theodosian Code see Godefroy ad l ii tit xxxiii tom i p that they were permitted to take six per cent or one half of the legal interest and what is more singular this permission was granted to the  young  senators  A considerable mass of treasure must always have existed at Rome either in the current coin of the empire or in the form of gold and silver plate and there were many sideboards in the time of Pliny which contained more solid silver than had been transported by Scipio from vanquished Carthage  Plin Hist Natur xxxiii He states the silver at only pounds which is increased by Livy xxx to the former seems too little for an opulent city the latter too much for any private sideboard  The greater part of the nobles who dissipated their fortunes in profuse luxury found themselves poor in the midst of wealth and idle in a constant round of dissipation Their desires were continually gratified by the labour of a thousand hands of the numerous train of their domestic slaves who were actuated by the fear of punishment and of the various professions of artificers and merchants who were more powerfully impelled by the hopes of gain The ancients were destitute of many of the conveniencies of life which have been invented or improved by the progress of industry and the plenty of glass and linen has diffused more  real comforts among the modern nations of Europe than the senators of Rome could derive from all the refinements of pompous or sensual luxury  The learned Arbuthnot Tables of Ancient Coins c p has observed with humour and I believe with truth that Augustus had neither glass to his windows nor a shirt to his back Under the lower empire the use of linen and glass became somewhat more common  Their luxury and their manners have been the subject of minute and laborious disquisition but as such enquiries would divert me too long from the design of the present work I shall produce an authentic state of Rome and its inhabitants which is more peculiarly applicable to the period of the Gothic invasion Ammianus Marcellinus who prudently chose the capital of the empire as the residence the best adapted to the historian of his own times has mixed with the narrative of public events a lively representation of the scenes with which he was familiarly conversant The judicious reader will not always approve the asperity of censure the choice of circumstances or the style of expression he will perhaps detect the latent prejudices and personal resentments which soured the temper of Ammianus himself but he will surely observe with philosophic curiosity the interesting and original picture of the manners of Rome  It is incumbent on me to explain the liberties which I have taken with the text of Ammianus I have melted down into one piece the sixth chapter of the fourteenth and the fourth of the twentyeighth book I have given order and connection to the confused mass of materials I have softened  some  extravagant hyperboles and pared away some supersluities of the original I have developed some observations which were insinuated rather than expressed With these allowances my version will be found not literal indeed but faithful and exact    "The greatness of Rome such is the language of the historian was founded on the rare and almost incredible alliance of virtue  Character of the Roman nobles by Ammianus Marcellinus  and of fortune The long period of her infancy was employed in a laborious struggle against the tribes of Italy the neighbours and enemies of the rising city In the strength and ardour of youth she sustained the storms of war carried her victorious arms beyond the seas and the mountains and brought home triumphal laurels from every country of the globe At length verging towards old age and sometimes conquering by the terror only of her name she sought the blessings of ease and tranquillity The VENERABLE CITY which had trampled on the necks of the fiercest nations and established a system of laws the perpetual guardians of justice and freedom was content like a wise and wealthy parent to devolve on the Caesars her favourite sons the care of governing her ample patrimony  Claudian who seems to have read the history of Ammianus speaks of this great revolution in a much less courtly style  Postquam jura ferox in se communia Caesar  Transtulit et lapsi mores desuetaque priscis  Artibus in gremium pacis servile recessi  De Bell Gildonico  A secure and profound peace such as had been once enjoyed in the reign of Numa succeeded to the tumults of a republic while Rome was still adored as the queen of the earth and the subject nations still reverenced the name of the people and the majesty of the senate But  this native splendour continues Ammianus is degraded and sullied by the conduct of some nobles who unmindful of their own dignity and of that of their country assume an unbounded licence of vice and folly They contend with each other in the empty vanity of titles and surnames and curiously select or invent the most lofty and sonorous appellations Reburrus or Fabunius Pagonius or Tarrasius  The minute diligence of antiquarians has not been able to verify these extraordinary names I am of opinion that they were invented by the historian himself who was afraid of any personal satire or application It is certain however that the simple denominations of the Romans were gradually lengthened to the number of four five or even seven pompous surnames as for instance Marcus Maecius Maemmius Furius Balburius Caecilianus Plaeidus See Noris Cenotaph Pisan Dissert iv p  which may impress the ears of the vulgar with astonishment and respect From a vain ambition of perpetuating their memory they affect to multiply their likeness in statues of bronze and marble nor are they satisfied unless those statues are covered with plates of gold an honourable distinction first granted to Acilius the consul after he had subdued by his arms and counsels the power of king Antiochus The ostentation of displaying of magnifying perhaps the rentroll of the estates which they possess in all the provinces from the rising to the setting sun provokes the just resentment of every man who recollects that their poor and invincible ancestors were not distinguished from the meanest of the soldiers by the delicacy of their food or the splendour  of their apparel But the modern nobles measure their rank and consequence according to the loftiness of their chariots  The  carrucae  or coaches of the Romans were often of solid silver curiously carved and engraved and the trappings of the mules or horses were embossed with gold This magnificence continued from the reign of Nero to that of Honorius and the Appian way was covered with the splendid equipages of the nobles who came out to meet St Melania when she returned to Rome six years before the Gothic siege Seneca epistol lxxxvii Plin Hist Natur xxxiii Paulin Nolan apud Baron Annal Eccles A D No Yet pomp is well exchanged for convenience and a plain modern coach that is hung upon springs is much preferable to the silver or gold  carts  of antiquity which rolled on the axletree and were exposed for the most part to the inclemency of the weather  and the weighty magnificence of their dress Their long robes of silk and purple float in the wind and as they are agitated by art or accident they occasionally discover the under garments the rich tunics embroidered with the figures of various animals  In a homily of Asterius bishop of Amasia M de Valois has discovered ad Ammian xiv that this was a new fashion that bears wolves lions and tygers woods huntingmatches c were represented in embroidery and that the more pious coxcombs substituted the figure or legend of some favourite saint  Followed by a train of fifty servants and tearing up the pavement they move along the streets with the same impetuous speed as if they travelled with posthorses and the example of the senators is boldly imitated by the matrons and ladies whose covered carriages are continually driving round the immense space of the city and suburbs Whenever these persons of high distinction condescend to visit the public baths they assume on their entrance a tone of loud and  insolent command and appropriate to their own use the conveniencies which were designed for the Roman people If in these places of mixed and general resort they meet any of the infamous ministers of their pleasures they express their affection by a tender embrace while they proudly decline the salutations of their fellowcitizens who are not permitted to aspire above the honour of kissing their hands or their knees As soon as they have indulged themselves in the refreshment of the bath they resume their rings and the other ensigns of their dignity select from their private wardrobe of the finest linen such as might suffice for a dozen persons the garments the most agreeable to their fancy and maintain till their departure the same haughty demeanour which perhaps might have been excused in the great Marcellus after the conquest of Syracuse Sometimes indeed these heroes undertake more arduous atchievements they

of their military leaders so the domestic officers who bear a rod as an ensign of authority distribute and arrange the numerous train of slaves and attendants The baggage and wardrobe move in the front and are immediately followed by a multitude of cooks and inferior ministers employed in the service of the kitchens and of the table The main body is composed of a promiscuous crowd of slaves increased by the accidental concourse of idle or dependent plebeians The rear is closed by the favourite band of eunuchs distributed from age to youth according to the order of seniority Their numbers and their deformity excite the horror of the indignant spectators who are rèady to execrate the memory of Semiramis for the cruel art which she invented of frustrating the purposes of nature and of blasting in the bud the hopes of future generations In the exercise of domestic jurisdiction the nobles of Rome express an exquisite sensibility for any personal injury and a contemptuous indifference for the rest of the human species When they have called for warm water if a slave has been tardy in his obedience he is instantly chastised with three hundred lashes but should the same slave commit a wilful murder the master will mildly observe that he is a worthless fellow but that if he repeats the offence he shall not escape punishment  Hospitality was formerly the virtue of the Romans and every stranger who could plead either merit or misfortune was relieved or rewarded by their generosity At present if a foreigner perhaps of no contemptible rank is introduced to one of the proud and wealthy senators he is welcomed indeed in the first audience with such warm professions and such kind enquiries that he retires enchanted with the affability of his illustrious friend and full of regret that he had so long delayed his journey to Rome the native seat of manners as well as of empire Secure of a favourable reception he repeats his visit the ensuing day and is mortified by the discovery that his person his name and his country are already forgotten If he still has resolution to persevere he is gradually numbered in the train of dependents and obtains the permission to pay his assiduous and unprofitable court to a haughty patron incapable of gratitude or friendship who scarcely deigns to remark his presence his departure or his return Whenever the rich prepare a solemn and popular entertainment  Distributio solemnium sportularum The  sportulae  or  sportellae  were small baskets supposed to contain a quantity of hot provisions of the value of quadrantes or twelvepence halfpenny which were ranged in order in the hall and ostentatiously distributed to the hungry or servile crowd who waited at the door This indelicate custom is very frequently mentioned in the epigrams of Martial and the satires of Juvenal See likewise Suetonius in Claud c in Neron c in Domitian c These baskets of provisions were afterwards converted into large pieces of gold and silver coin or plate which were mutually given and accepted even by the persons of the highest rank see Symmach epist iv ix and Miscell p on solemn occasions of consulships marriages c  whenever they

nomenclators who are commonly swayed by interested motives have the address to insert in the list of invitations the obscure names of the most worthless of mankind But the frequent and familiar companions of the great are those parasites who practise the most useful of all arts the art of flattery who eagerly applaud each word and every action of their immortal patron gaze with rapture on his marble columns and variegated pavements and strenuously praise the pomp and elegance which he is taught to consider as a part of his personal merit At the Roman tables the birds the  squirrels

Historicis Latin l ii c in his works vol iv p  The libraries which they have inherited from their fathers are secluded like dreary sepulchres from the light of day  This satire is probably exaggerated The Saturnalia of Macrobius and the Epistles of Jerom afford satisfactory proofs that Christian theology and classic literature were studiously cultivated by several Romans of both sexes and of the highest rank  But the costly instruments of the theatre flutes and enormous lyres and hydraulic organs are constructed for their use and the harmony of vocal and instrumental music is incessantly repeated in the palaces of Rome In those palaces sound is preferred to sense and the care of the body to that of the mind It is allowed as a salutary maxim that the light and frivolous suspicion of a contagious malady is of sufficient weight to excuse the visits of the most intimate friends and even the servants who are dispatched to make the decent enquiries are not suffered to return home till they have undergone the ceremony of a previous ablution Yet this selfish and unmanly delicacy occasionally yields to the more imperious passion of avarice The prospect of gain will  urge a rich and gouty senator as far as Spoleto every sentiment of arrogance and dignity is subdued by the hopes of an inheritance or even of a legacy and a wealthy childless citizen is the most powerful of the Romans The art of obtaining the signature of a favourable testament and sometimes of hastening the moment of its execution is perfectly understood and it has happened that in the same house though in different apartments a husband and a wife with the laudable design of overreaching each other have summoned their respective lawyers to declare at the same time their mutual but contradictory intentions The distress which follows and chastises extravagant luxury often reduces the great to the use of the most humiliating expedients When they desire to borrow they employ the base and supplicating style of the slave in the comedy but when they are called upon to pay they assume the royal and tragic declamation of the grandsons of Hercules If the demand is repeated they readily procure some trusty sycophant instructed to maintain a charge of poison or magic against the insolent creditor who is seldom released from prison till he has signed a discharge of the whole debt These vices which degrade the moral character of the Romans are mixed with a puerile superstition that disgraces their understanding They listen with confidence to the predictions of haruspices who pretend to read in the entrails  of victims the signs of future greatness and prosperity and there are many who do not presume either to bathe or to dine or to appear in public till they have diligently consulted according to the rules of astrology the situation of Mercury and the aspect of the moon  Macrobius the friend of these Roman nobles considered the stars as the cause or at least the signs of future events de Somn Scipion l i c p  It is singular enough that this vain credulity may often be discovered among the prophane sceptics who impiously doubt or deny the existence of a celestial power"  In populous cities which are the seat of commerce and manufactures the middle ranks  State and character of the people of Rome  of inhabitants who derive their subsistence from the dexterity or labour of their hands are commonly the most prolific the most useful and in that sense the most respectable part of the community But the plebeians of Rome who disdained such sedentary and servile arts had been oppressed from the earliest times by the weight of debt and usury and the husbandman during the term of his military service was obliged to abandon the cultivation of his farm  The histories of Livy see particularly vi are full of the extortions of the rich and the sufferings of the poor debtors The melancholy story of a brave old soldier Dionys Hal l vi c p edit Hudson and Livy ii must have been frequently repeated in those primitive times which have been so undeservedly praised  The lands of Italy which had been originally divided among the families of free and indigent proprietors were insensibly purchased or usurped by the  avarice of the nobles and in the age which preceded the fall of the republic it was computed that only two thousand citizens were possessed of any independent substance  Non esse in civitate duo millia hominum qui rem haberent Cicero Offic ii and Comment Paul Manut in edit Graev This vague computation was made A U C in a speech of the tribune Philippus and it was his object as well as that of the Gracchi see Plutarch to deplore and perhaps to exaggerate the misery of the common people  Yet as long as the people bestowed by their suffrages the honours of the state the command of the legions and the administration of wealthy provinces their conscious pride alleviated in some measure the hardships of poverty and their wants were seasonably supplied by the ambitious liberality of the candidates who aspired to secure a venal majority in the thirtyfive tribes or the hundred and ninetythree centuries of Rome But when the prodigal commons had imprudently alienated not only the  use  but the  inheritance  of power they sunk under the reign of the Caesars into a vile and wretched populace which must in a few generations have been totally extinguished if it had not been continually recruited by the manumission of slaves and the influx of strangers As early as the time of Hadrian it was the just complaint of the ingenuous natives that the capital had attracted the vices of the universe and the manners of the most opposite nations The intemperance of the Gauls the cunning and levity of the Greeks the savage obstinacy of the Egyptians and Jews the servile temper of the Asiatics  and the dissolute effeminate prostitution of the Syrians were mingled in the various multitude which under the proud and false denomination of Romans presumed to despise their fellowsubjects and even their sovereigns who dwelt beyond the precincts of the ETERNAL CITY  See the third Satire of Juvenal who indignantly complains  Quamvis

be found in the fourteenth book of the Theodosian Code which expressly treats of the  police  of the great cities See particularly the titles iii iv xv xvi xvii xxiv The collateral testimonies are produced in Godefroy's Commentary and it is needless to transcribe them According to a law of Theodosius which appreciates in money the military allowance a piece of gold eleven shillings was

wholesome meat During five months of the year a regular allowance of bacon was distributed to the poorer citizens and the annual consumption of the capital at a time when it was much declined from its former lustre was ascertained by an edict of Valentinian the Third at three millions six hundred and twentyeight thousand pounds  See Novell ad  Cod Theod D Valent l i tit xv This law was publishe  ome June the th A D  III In the manners of antiquity the use of oil was indispensable for the lamp as well as for the bath and the annual tax which was imposed on Africa for the benefit of Rome amounted to the weight of three millions of pounds to the measure perhaps of three hundred thousand English gallons IV The anxiety of Augustus to provide  the metropolis with sufficient plenty of corn was not extended beyond that necessary article of human subsistence and when the popular clamour accused the dearness and scarcity of wine a proclamation was issued by the grave reformer to remind his subjects that no man could reasonably complain of thirst since the aqueducts of Agrippa had introduced into the city so many copious streams of pure and salubrious water  Sueton in August c The utmost debauch of the emperor himself in his favourite wine of Rhaetia never exceeded a  sextarius  an English pint Id c Torrentius ad Loc and Arbuthnot's Tables p  This rigid sobriety was insensibly relaxed and although the generous design of Aurelian  His design was to plant vineyards along the sea coast of Hetruria Vopiscus in Hist August p the dreary unwholesome uncultivated  Maremme  of modern Tuscany  does not appear to have been executed in its full extent the use of wine was allowed on very easy and liberal terms The administration of the public cellars was delegated to a magistrate of honourable rank and a considerable part of the vintage of Campania was reserved for the fortunate inhabitants of Rome  The stupendous aqueducts so justly celebrated  Use of the public baths  by the praises of Augustus himself replenished the  Thermae  or baths which had been constructed in every part of the city with Imperial magnificence The baths of Antoninus Caracalla which were open at stated hours for the indiscriminate service of the senators and the people contained above sixteen hundred seats of marble and more  than three thousand were reckoned in the baths of Diocletian  Olympiodor apud Phot p  The walls of the lofty apartments were covered with curious mosaics that imitated the art of the pencil in the elegance of design and the variety of colours The Egyptian granite was beautifully incrusted with the precious green marble of Numidia the perpetual stream of hot water was poured into the capacious basons through so many mide mouths of bright and massy silver and the meanest Roman could purchase with a small copper coin the daily enjoyment of a scene of pomp and luxury which might excite the envy of the kings of Asia  Seneca epistol lxxxvi compares the Baths of Scipio Africanus at his villa of Liternum with the magnificence which was continually encreasing of the public baths of Rome long before the stately Thermae of Antoninus and Diocletian were erected The  quadrans  paid for admission was the quarter of the  as  about oneeighth of an English penny  From these stately palaces issued a swarm of dirty and ragged plebeians without shoes and without a mantle who loitered away whole days in the street or Forum to hear news and to hold disputes who dissipated in extravagant gaming the miserable pittance of their wives and children and spent the hours of the night in obscure taverns and brothels in the indulgence of gross and vulgar sensuality  Ammianus l xiv c and l xxviii c after describing the luxury and pride of the nobles of Rome exposes with equal indignation the vices and follies of the common people    But the most lively and splendid amusement of the idle multitude depended on the frequent exhibition of public games and spectacles The  Games and spectacles  piety of Christian princes had suppressed the inhuman combats of gladiators but the Roman people still considered the Circus as their home their temple and the seat of the republic The impatient crowd rushed at the dawn of day to secue their places and there were many who passed a sleepless and anxious night in the adjacent porticos From the morning to the evening careless of the sun or of the rain the spectators who sometimes amounted to the number of four hundred thousand remained in eager attention their eyes fixed on the horses and charioteers their minds agitated with hope and fear for the success of the  colours  which they espoused and the happiness of Rome appeared to hang on the event of a race  Juvenal Satir xi c The expressions of the historian Ammianus are not less strong and animated than those of the satirist and both the one and the other painted from the life The numbers which the great Circus was capable of receiving are taken from the  original Notitiae  of the city The differences between them prove that they did not transcribe each other but the sum may appear incredible though the country on these occasions flocked to the city  The same immoderate ardour inspired their clamours and their applause as often as they were entertained with the hunting of wild beasts and the various modes of theatrical representation These representations in modern capitals may deserve to be considered as a pure and elegant school of taste and perhaps of virtue But the Tragic and Comic Muse of the Romans  who seldom aspired beyond the imitation of Attic genius  Sometimes indeed they composed original pieces  Vestigia Graeca  Ausi deserere et celebrare domestica facta  Horat Epistol ad Pisones and the learned

imperfect method of hiring a great room and reading his play to the company whom he invited for that purpose See Dialog de Oratoribus c and Plin Epistol vii  and their place was unworthily occupied by licentious farce effeminate music and splendid pageantry The pantomimes  See the Dialogue of Lucian intitled De Saltatione tom ii p edit Reitz The pantomimes obtained the honourable name of  and it was required that they should be conversant with almost every art and science Burette in the Memoires de l'Academie des Inscriptions tom i p c has given a short history of the art of pantomimes  who maintained their reputation from the age of Augustus to the sixth century expressed without the use of words the various fables of the gods and heroes of antiquity and the perfection of their art which sometimes disarmed the gravity of the philosopher always excited the applause and wonder of the people The vast and magnificent theatres of Rome were filled by three thousand female dancers and by three thousand singers with the masters of the respective chorusses Such was the popular favour which they enjoyed that in a time of scarcity when all strangers were banished from the city the merit of contributing to the public  pleasures exempted  them  from a law which was strictly executed against the professors of the liberal arts  Ammianus l xiv c He complains with decent indignation that the streets of Rome were filled with crowds of females who might have given children to the state but whose only occupation was to curl and dress their hair and jactari volubilibus gyris dum exprimunt innumera simulacra quae finxere fabulae theatrales    It is said that the foolish curiosity of Elagabalus attempted to discover from the quantity of  Populousness of Rome  spiders webs the number of the inhabitants of Rome A more rational method of enquiry might not have been undeserving of the attention of the wisest princes who could easily have resolved a question so important for the Roman government and so interesting to succeeding ages The births and deaths of the citizens were duly registered and if any writer of antiquity had condescended to mention the annual amount or the common average we might now produce some satisfactory calculation which would destroy the extravagant assertions of critics and perhaps confirm the modest and probable conjectures of philosophers  Lipsius tom iii p de Magnitud Romanâ l iii c and Isaac Vossius Observat Var p have indulged strange dreams of four or eight or fourteen millions in Rome Mr Hume Essays vol i p with admirable good sense and scepticism betrays some secret disposition to extenuate the populousness of ancient times  The most diligent researches have collected only the following circumstances which slight and imperfect as they are may tend in some degree to illustrate the question of the populousness of ancient Rome I When the capital of the empire was besieged by the  Goths the circuit of the walls was accurately measured by Ammonius the mathematician who found it equal to twentyone miles  Olympiodor ap Phot p See Fabricius Bibl Graec tom ix p  It should not be forgotten that the form of the city was almost that of a circle the geometrical figure which is known to contain the largest space within any given circumference II The architect Vitruvius who flourished in the Augustan age and whose evidence on this occasion has peculiar weight and authority observes that the innumerable habitations of the Roman people would have spread themselves far beyond the narrow limits of the city and that the want of ground which was probably contracted on every side by gardens and villas suggested the common though inconvenient practice of raising the houses to a considerable height in the air  In eâ autem majestate urbis et civium infinitâ frequentiâ innumerabiles habitationes opus fuit explicare Ergo cum recipere non posset area plana tantam multitudinem in urbe ad auxilium altitudinis aedificiorum res ipsa coëgit devenire Vitruv ii This passage which I owe to Vossius is clear strong and comprehensive  But the loftiness of these buildings which often consisted of hasty work and insufficient materials was the cause of frequent and fatal accidents and it was repeatedly enacted by Augustus as well as by Nero that the height of private edifices within the walls of Rome should not exceed the measure of seventy feet from the ground  The successive testimonies of Pliny Aristides Claudian Rutilius c prove the insufficiency of these restrictive edicts See Lipsius de Magnitud Romanâ l iii c  Tabulata tibi jam tertia fumant  Tu nescis nam si gradibus trepidatur ab imis  Ultimus ardebit quem tegula sola tuetur  A pluviâ  Juvenal Satir iii  III Juvenal  Read the whole third satire but particularly c The description of a crowded  insula  or lodginghouse in Petronius c perfectly tallies with the complaints of Juvenal and we learn from legal authority that in the time of Augustus Heineccius Hist Juris Roman c iv p the ordinary rent of the several  caenacula  or apartments of an  insula  annually produced forty thousand sesterces between three and four hundred pounds sterling Pandect l xix tit ii No a sum which proves at once the large extent and high value of those common buildings  laments as it should seem from his own experience the hardships of the poorer citizens to whom he addresses the salutary advice of emigrating without delay from the smoke of Rome since they might purchase in the little towns of Italy a cheerful commodious dwelling at the same price which they annually paid for a dark and miserable lodging Houserent was therefore immoderately dear the rich acquired at an enormous expence the ground which they covered with palaces and gardens but the body of the Roman people was crowded into a narrow space and the different floors and apartments of the same house were divided as it is still the custom of Paris and other cities among several families of plebeians IV The total number of houses in the fourteen regions of the city is accurately stated in the description of Rome composed under the reign of Theodosius and they amount to fortyeight thousand three hundred and  eightytwo  This sum total is composed of  domus  or great houses of  insulae  or plebeian habitations See Nardini Roma Antica l iii p and these numbers are ascertained by the agreement of the texts of the different  Notitiae  Nardini l viii p  The two classes of  domus  and of  insulae  into which they are divided include all the habitations of the capital of every rank and condition from the marble palace of the Anicii with a numerous establishment of freedmen and slaves to the lofty and narrow lodginghouse where the poet Codrus and his wife were permitted to hire a wretched garret immediately under the tiles If we adopt the same average which under similar circumstances has been found applicable to Paris  See that accurate writer M de Messance Recherches sur la Population p From probable or certain grounds he assigns to Paris houses families and inhabitants  and indifferently allow about twentyfive persons for each house of every degree we may fairly estimate the inhabitants of Rome at twelve hundred thousand a number which cannot be thought excessive for the capital of a mighty empire though it exceeds the populousness of the greatest cities of modern Europe  This computation is not very different from that which M Brotier the last editor of Tacitus tom ii p has assumed from similar principles though he seems to aim at a degree of precision which it is neither possible nor important to obtain    Such was the state of Rome under the reign of  First siege of Rome by the Goths A D  Honorius at the time when the Gothic army formed the siege or rather the blockade of the city  For the events of the first siege of Rome which are often confounded with those of the second and third see Zosimus l v p Sozomen l ix c

commanded the twelve principal gates intercepted all communication with the adjacent country and vigilantly guarded the navigation of the Tyber from which the Romans derived the surest and most plentiful supply of provisions The first emotions of the nobles and of the people were those of surprise and indignation that a vile Barbarian should dare to insult the capital of the world but their arrogance was soon humbled by misfortune and their unmanly rage instead of being directed against an enemy in arms was meanly exercised on a defenceless and innocent victim Perhaps in the person of Serena the Romans might have respected the niece of Theodosius the aunt nay even the adoptive mother of the reigning emperor but they abhorred the widow of Stilicho and they listened with credulous passion to the tale of calumny which accused her of maintaining a secret and criminal correspondence with the Gothic invader Actuated or overawed by the same popular frenzy the senate without requiring any evidence of her guilt pronounced the sentence of her death Serena was ignominiously strangled and the infatuated multitude were astonished to find that this cruel act of injustice did not immediately produce the retreat of the Barbarians and the deliverance of the city That unfortunate city  Famine  gradually experienced the distress of scarcity and at length the horrid calamities of famine The daily allowance of three pounds of bread was reduced to onehalf to onethird to nothing and the price of corn still continued to rise in a rapid and extravagant proportion The poorer citizens who were unable to purchase the necessaries of life solicited the precarious charity of the rich and for a while the public misery was alleviated by the humanity of Laeta the widow of the emperor Gratian who had fixed her residence at Rome and consecrated to the use of the indigent the princely revenue which she annually received from the grateful successors of her husband  The mother of Laeta was named Pissumena Her father family and country are unknown Ducange Fam Byzantin p  But these private and temporary donatives were insufficient to appease the hunger of a numerous people and the progress of famine invaded the marble palaces of the senators themselves The persons of both sexes who had been educated in the enjoyment of ease and luxury discovered how little is requisite to supply the demands of nature and lavished their unavailing treasures of gold and silver to obtain the coarse and scanty sustenance which they would formerly have rejected with disdain The food the most repugnant to sense or imagination the aliments the most unwholesome and pernicious to the constitution were eagerly devoured and fiercely disputed by the rage of hunger A dark suspicion was entertained that some desperate wretches fed on the bodies of their fellowcreatures  whom they had secretly murdered and even mothers such was the horrid conflict of the two most powerful instincts

latter compare the tenth book of the Henriade and the Journal de Henri IV tom i p and observe that a plain narrative of facts is much more pathetic than the most laboured descriptions of epic poetry  Many thousands of the inhabitants of Rome expired in their houses or in the streets for want of sustenance and as the public sepulchres without the walls were in the power of the enemy the stench which arose from so many putrid and unburied carcasses infected the air and the miseries of famine were succeeded and aggravated by the contagion of a pestilential disease The assurances  Plague  of speedy and effectual relief which were repeatedly transmitted from the court of Ravenna supported for some time the fainting resolution of the Romans till at length the despair of any human aid tempted them to accept the offers of a praeternatural deliverance Pompeianus  Superstition  praefect of the city had been persuaded by the art or fanaticism of some Tuscan diviners that by the mysterious force of spells and sacrifices they could extract the lightning from the clouds and point those celestial fires against the  camp of the Barbarians  Zosimus l v p speaks of these ceremonies like a Greek unacquainted with the national superstition of Rome and Tuscany I suspect that they consisted of two parts the secret and the public the former were probably an imitation of the arts and spells by which Numa had drawn down Jupiter and his thunder on Mount Aventine  Quid agant laqueis quae carmina dicant  Quâque trahant superis sedibus arte Jovem  Scire nefas homini  The  ancilia  or shields of Mars the  pignora Imperii  which were carried in solemn procession on the calends of March derived their origin from this mysterious event Ovid Fast iii It was probably designed to revive this ancient festival which had been suppressed by Theodosius In that case we recover a chronological date March the st A D which has not hitherto been observed  The important secret was communicated to Innocent the bishop of Rome and the successor of St Peter is accused perhaps without foundation of preferring the safety of the republic to the rigid severity of the Christian worship But when the question was agitated in the senate when it was proposed as an essential condition that those sacrifices should be performed in the Capitol by the authority and in the presence of the magistrates the majority of that respectable assembly apprehensive either of the Divine or of the Imperial displeasure refused to join in an act which appeared almost equivalent to the public restoration of Paganism  Sozomen l ix c insinuates that the experiment was actually though unsuccessfully made but he does not mention the name of Innocent and Tillemont Mem Eccles tom x p is determined not to believe that a

a ransom and raises the siege A D  emergency assumed the supreme powers of government appointed two ambassadors to negociate with the enemy This important trust was delegated to Basilius a senator of Spanish extraction and already conspicuous in the administration of provinces and to John the first tribune of the notaries who was peculiarly qualified by his dexterity in business as well as by his former intimacy with the Gothic prince When they were introduced into his presence they declared perhaps in a more lofty style than became their abject condition that the Romans were resolved to maintain their dignity either in peace or war and that if Alaric refused them a fair and honourable capitulation he might sound his trumpets and prepare to give battle to an innumerable people exercised in arms and animated by despair  "The thicker the hay the easier it is mowed"  was the concise reply of the Barbarian and this rustic metaphor was accompanied by a loud and insulting laugh expressive of his contempt for the menaces of an unwarlike populace enervated by luxury before they were emaciated by famine He then condescended to fix the ransom which he would accept as the price of his retreat from the walls of Rome  all  the gold and silver in the city whether it were the property of the state or of individuals  all  the rich and precious moveables and  all  the  slaves who could prove their title to the name of  Barbarians  The ministers of the senate presumed to ask in a modest and suppliant tone  "If such O King are your demands what do you intend to leave us"  "YOUR LIVES"  replied the haughty conqueror they trembled and retired Yet before they retired a short suspension of arms was granted which allowed some time for a more temperate negociation The stern features of Alaric were insensibly relaxed he abated much of the rigour of his terms and at length consented to raise the siege on the immediate payment of five thousand pounds of gold of thirty thousand pounds of silver of four thousand robes of silk of three thousand pieces of fine scarlet cloth and of three thousand pounds weight of pepper  Pepper was a favourite ingredient of the most expensive Roman cookery and the best sort commonly sold for fifteen denarii or ten shillings the pound See Pliny Hist Natur xii It was brought from India and the same country the coast of Malabar still affords the greatest plenty but the improvement of trade and navigation has multiplied the quantity and reduced the price See Histoire Politique et Philosophique c tom i p  But the public treasury was exhausted the annual rents of the great estates in Italy and the provinces were intercepted by the calamities of war the gold and gems had been exchanged during the famine for the vilest sustenance the hoards of secret wealth were still concealed by the obstinacy of avarice and some remains of consecrated spoils afforded the only resource that could avert the impending ruin of the city As soon as the Romans had satisfied the rapacious demands of Alaric they were restored  in some measure to the enjoyment of peace and plenty Several of the gates were cautiously opened the importation of provisions from the river and the adjacent country was no longer obstructed by the Goths the citizens resorted in crowds to the free market which was held during three days in the suburbs and while the merchants who undertook this gainful trade made a considerable profit the future subsistence of the city was secured by the ample magazines which were deposited in the public and private granaries A more regular discipline than could have been expected was maintained in the camp of Alaric and the wise Barbarian justified his regard for the faith of treaties by the just severity with which he chastised a party of licentious Goths who had insulted some Roman citizens on the road to Ostia His army enriched by the contributions of the capital slowly advanced into the fair and fruitful province of Tuscany where he proposed to establish his winterquarters and the Gothic standard became the refuge of forty thousand Barbarian slaves who had broke their chains and aspired under the command of their great deliverer to revenge the injuries and the disgrace of their cruel servitude About the same time he received a more honourable reinforcement of Goths and Huns whom Adolphus  This Gothic chieftain is called by Jornandes and Isidore  Athaulphus  by Zosimus and Orosius  Ataulphus  and by Olympiodorus  Adaoulphus  I have used the celebrated name of  Adolphus  which seems to be authorised by the practice of the Swedes the sons or brothers of the ancient Goths  the brother of his wife  had conducted at his pressing invitation from the banks of the Danube to those of the Tyber and who had cut their way with some difficulty and loss through the superior numbers of the Imperial troops A victorious leader who united the daring spirit of a Barbarian with the art and discipline of a Roman general was at the head of an hundred thousand fighting men and Italy pronounced with terror and respect the formidable name of Alaric  The treaty between Alaric and the Romans c is taken from Zosimus l v p The additional circumstances are too few and trifling to require any other quotation    At the distance of fourteen centuries we may  Fruitless negociations for peace A D  be satisfied with relating the military exploits of the conquerors of Rome without presuming to investigate the motives of their political conduct In the midst of his apparent prosperity Alaric was conscious perhaps of some secret weakness some internal defect or perhaps the moderation which he displayed was intended only to deceive and disarm the easy credulity of the ministers of Honorius The king of the Goths repeatedly declared that it was his desire to be considered as the friend of peace and of the Romans Three senators at his earnest request were sent ambassadors to the court of Ravenna to solicit the exchange of hostages and the conclusion of the treaty and the proposals which he more clearly expressed during the course of the negociations could only inspire a doubt of his sincerity as they might seem inadequate to the state of his fortune The Barbarian still aspired to the rank  of mastergeneral of the armies of the West he stipulated an annual subsidy of corn and money and he chose the provinces of Dalmatia Noricum and Venetia for the seat of his new kingdom which would have commanded the important communication between Italy and the Danube If these modest terms should be rejected Alaric shewed a disposition to relinquish his pecuniary demands and even to content himself with the possession of Noricum an exhausted and impoverished country perpetually exposed to the inroads of the Barbarians of Germany  Zosimus l v p  But the hopes of peace were disappointed by the weak obstinacy or interested views of the minister Olympius Without listening to the salutary remonstrances of the senate he dismissed their ambassadors under the conduct of a military escort too numerous for a retinue of honour and too feeble for an army of defence Six thousand Dalmatians the flower of the Imperial legions were ordered to march from Ravenna to Rome through an open country which was occupied by the formidable myriads of the Barbarians These brave legionaries encompassed and betrayed fell a sacrifice to ministerial folly their general Valens with an hundred soldiers escaped from the field of battle and one of the ambassadors who could no longer claim the protection of the law of nations was obliged to purchase his freedom with a ransom of thirty thousand pieces of gold Yet Alaric instead of resenting this act of impotent hostility immediately renewed  his proposals of peace and the second embassy of the Roman senate which derived weight and dignity from the presence of Innocent bishop of the city was guarded from the dangers of the road by a detachment of Gothic soldiers  Zosimus l v p The bishop by remaining at Ravenna escaped the impending calamities of the city Orosius l vii c p    Olympius  For the adventures of Olympius and his successors in the ministry see Zosimus l v p and Olympiodor ap Phot p  might have continued to insult  Change and succession of ministers  the just resentment of a people who loudly accused him as the author of the public calamities but his power was undermined by the secret intrigues of the palace The favourite eunuchs transferred the government of Honorius and the empire to Jovius the Praetorian praefect an unworthy servant who did not atone by the merit of personal attachment for the errors and misfortunes of his administration The exile or escape of the guilty Olympius reserved him for more vicissitudes of fortune he experienced the adventures of an obscure and wandering life he again rose to power he fell a second time into disgrace his ears were cut off he expired under the lash and his ignominious death afforded a grateful spectacle to the friends of Stilicho After the removal of Olympius whose character was deeply tainted with religious fanaticism the Pagans and heretics were delivered from the impolitic proscription which excluded them from the dignities of the state The brave Gennerid  Zosimus l v p relates this circumstance with visible complacency and celebrates the character of Gennerid as the last glory of expiring paganism Very different were the sentiments of the council of Carthage who deputed four bishops to the court of Ravenna to complain of the law which had been just enacted that all conversions to Christianity should be free and voluntary See Baronius Annal Eccles A D No A D No    a soldier of Barbarian origin who still adhered to the worship of his ancestors had been obliged to lay aside the military belt and though he was repeatedly assured by the emperor himself that laws were not made for persons of his rank or merit he refused to accept any partial dispensation and persevered in honourable disgrace till he had extorted a general act of justice from the distress of the Roman government The conduct of Gennerid in the important station to which he was promoted or restored of mastergeneral of Dalmatia Pannonia Noricum and Rhaetia seemed to revive the discipline and spirit of the republic From a life of idleness and want his troops were soon habituated to severe exercise and plentiful subsistence and his private generosity often supplied the rewards which were denied by the avarice or poverty of the court of Ravenna The valour of Gennerid formidable to the adjacent Barbarians was the firmest bulwark of the Illyrian frontier and his vigilant care assisted the empire with a reinforcement of ten thousand Huns who arrived on the confines of Italy attended by such a convoy of provisions and such a numerous train of sheep and oxen as might have been sufficient not only for the march of an army but for the  settlement of a colony But the court and councils of Honorius still remained a scene of weakness and distraction of corruption and anarchy Instigated by the praefect Jovius the guards rose in furious mutiny and demanded the heads of two generals and of the two principal eunuchs The generals under a perfidious promise of safety were sent on shipboard and privately executed while the favour of the eunuchs procured them a mild and secure exile at Milan and Constantinople Eusebius the eunuch and the Barbarian Allobich succeeded to the command of the bedchamber and of the guards and the mutual jealousy of these subordinate ministers was the cause of their mutual destruction By the insolent order of the count of the domestics the great chamberlain was shamefully beaten to death with sticks before the eyes of the astonished emperor and the subsequent assassination of Allobich in the midst of a public procession is the only circumstance of his life in which Honorius discovered the faintest symptom of courage or resentment Yet before they fell Eusebius and Allobich had contributed their part to the ruin of the empire by opposing the conclusion of a treaty which Jovius from a selfish and perhaps a criminal motive had negociated with Alaric in a personal interview under the walls of Rimini During the absence of Jovius the emperor was persuaded to assume a lofty tone of inflexible dignity such as neither his situation nor his character could enable him to support and a letter signed with the name of Honorius  was immediately dispatched to the Praetorian praefect granting him a free permission to dispose of the public money but sternly refusing to prostitute the military honours of Rome to the proud demands of a Barbarian This letter was imprudently communicated to Alaric himself and the Goth who in the whole transaction had behaved with temper and decency expressed in the most outrageous language his lively sense of the insult so wantonly offered to his person and to his nation The conference of Rimini was hastily interrupted and the praefect Jovius on his return to Ravenna was compelled to adopt and even to encourage the fashionable opinions of the court By his advice and example the principal officers of the state and army were obliged to swear that without listening in  any  circumstances to  any  conditions of peace they would still persevere in perpetual and implacable war against the enemy of the republic This rash engagement opposed an insuperable bar to all future negociation The ministers of Honorius were heard to declare that if they had only invoked the name of the Deity they would consult the public safety and trust their souls to the mercy of Heaven but they had sworn by the sacred head of the emperor himself they had touched in solemn ceremony that august seat of majesty and wisdom and the violation of their oath would expose them to the temporal penalties of sacrilege and rebellion  Zosimus l v p This custom of swearing by the head or life or safety or genius of the sovereign was of the highest antiquity both in Egypt Genesis xlii and Scythia It was soon transferred by flattery to the Caesars and Tertullian complains that it was the only oath which the Romans of his time affected to reverence See an elegant Dissertation of the Abbé Massieu on the Oaths of the Ancients in the Mem de l'Academie des Inscriptions tom i p

to the resentment of Alaric Yet such was the moderation which he still preserved or affected that as he moved with his army along the Flaminian way he successively dispatched the bishops of the towns of Italy to reiterate his offers of peace and to conjure the emperor that he would save the city and its inhabitants from hostile fire and the sword of the Barbarians  Zosimus l v p I have softened the expressions of Alaric who expatiates in too florid a manner on the history of Rome  These impending calamities were however averted not indeed by the wisdom of Honorius but by the prudence or humanity of the Gothic king who employed a milder though not less effectual method of conquest Instead of assaulting the capital he successively directed his efforts against the  Port  of Ostia one of the boldest and most stupendous works of Roman magnificence  See Sueton in Claud c Dion Cassius l lx p edit Reimar and the lively description of Juvenal Satir xii c In the sixteenth century when the remains of this Augustan port were still visible the antiquarians sketched the plan see d'Anville Mem de l'Academie des Inscriptions tom xxx p and declared with enthusiasm that all the monarchs of Europe would be unable to execute so great a work Bergier Hist des grands Chemins des Romains tom ii p  The accidents to which  the precarious subsistence of the city was continually exposed in a winternavigation and an open road had suggested to the genius of the first Caesar the useful design which was executed under the reign of Claudius The artificial moles which formed the narrow entrance advanced far into the sea and firmly repelled the fury of the waves while the largest vessels securely rode at anchor within three deep and capacious basons which received the northern branch of the Tyber about two miles from the ancient colony of Ostia  The  Ostia Tyberina  see Cluver Italia Antiq l iii p in the plural number the two mouths of the Tyber were separated by the Holy Island an equilateral triangle whose sides were each of them computed at about two miles The colony of Ostia was founded immediately beyond the left or southern and the  Port  immediately beyond the right or northern branch of the river and the distance between their remains measures something more than two miles on Cingolani's map In the time of Strabo the sand and mud deposited by the Tyber had choked the harbour of Ostia the progress of the same cause has added much to the size of the Holy Island and gradually left both Ostia and the Port at a considerable distance from the shore The dry channels

corn of Africa was deposited in spacious granaries for the use of the capital As soon as Alaric was in possession of that important place he summoned the city to surrender at discretion and his demands were enforced by the positive declaration that a refusal or even a delay should be instantly followed by the destruction of the magazines on which the life of the Roman people depended The clamours of that people and the terror of famine subdued the pride of the senate they listened without reluctance to the proposal of placing a new emperor on the throne of the unworthy Honorius and the suffrage of the Gothic conqueror bestowed the purple on Attalus praefect of the city The grateful monarch immediately acknowledged his protector as mastergeneral of the armies of the West Adolphus with the rank of count of the domestics obtained the custody of the person of Attalus and the two hostile nations seemed to be united in the closest bands of friendship and alliance  For the elevation of Attalus consult Zosimus l vi p Sozomen l ix c Olympiodor ap Phot p Philostorg l xii c and Godefroy Dissertat p    The gates of the city were thrown open and  Attalus is created emperor by the Goths and Romans  the new emperor of the Romans encompassed on every side by the Gothic arms was conducted in tumultuous procession to the palace of Augustus and Trajan After he had distributed the civil and military dignities among his favourites and followers Attalus convened an assembly of the senate before whom in a formal and florid speech he asserted his resolution of restoring the  majesty of the republic and of uniting to the empire the provinces of Egypt and the East which had once acknowledged the sovereignty of Rome Such extravagant promises inspired every reasonable citizen with a just contempt for the character of an unwarlike usurper whose elevation was the deepest and most ignominious wound which the republic had yet sustained from the insolence of the Barbarians But the populace with their usual levity applauded the change of masters The public discontent was favourable to the rival of Honorius and the sectaries oppressed by his persecuting edicts expected some degree of countenance or at least of toleration from a prince who in his native country of Ionia had been educated in the Pagan superstition and who had since received the sacrament of baptism from the hands of an Arian bishop  We may admit the evidence of Sozomen for the Arian baptism and that of Philostorgius for the Pagan education of Attalus The visible joy of Zosimus and the discontent which he imputes to the Anician family are very unfavourable to the Christianity of the new emperor  The first days of the reign of Attalus were fair and prosperous An officer of confidence was sent with an inconsiderable body of troops to secure the obedience of Africa the greatest part of Italy submitted to the terror of the Gothic powers and though the city of Bologna made a vigorous and effectual resistance the people of Milan dissatisfied perhaps with the absence of Honorius accepted with loud acclamations the choice of the Roman senate At the head of a formidable army Alaric conducted his royal captive  almost to the gates of Ravenna and a solemn embassy of the principal ministers of Jovius the Praetorian praefect of Valens master of the cavalry and infantry of the quaestor Potamius and of Julian the first of the notaries was introduced with martial pomp into the Gothic camp In the name of their sovereign they consented to acknowledge the lawful election of his competitor and to divide the provinces of Italy and the West between the two emperors Their proposals were rejected with disdain and the refusal was aggravated by the insulting clemency of Attalus who condescended to promise that if Honorius would instantly resign the purple he should be permitted to pass the remainder of his life in the peaceful exile of some remote island  He carried his insolence so far as to declare that he should mutilate Honorius before he sent him into exile But this assertion of Zosimus is destroyed by the more impartial testimony of Olympiodorus who attributes the ungenerous proposal which was absolutely rejected by Attalus to the baseness and perhaps the treachery of Jovius  So desperate indeed did the situation of the son of Theodosius appear to those who were the best acquainted with his strength and resources that Jovius and Valens his minister and his general betrayed their trust infamously deserted the sinking cause of their benefactor and devoted their treacherous allegiance to the service of his more fortunate rival Astonished by such examples of domestic treason Honorius trembled at the approach of every servant at the arrival of every messenger He dreaded the secret enemies  who might lurk in his capital his palace his bedchamber and some ships lay ready in the harbour of Ravenna to transport the abdicated monarch to the dominions of his infant nephew the emperor of the East  But there  is  a Providence such at least was the opinion of the historian Procopius  Procop de Bell Vandal l i c  that watches  He is degraded by Alaric A D  over innocence and folly and the pretensions of Honorius to its peculiar care cannot reasonably be disputed At the moment when his despair incapable of any wise or manly resolution meditated a shameful flight a seasonable reinforcement of four thousand veterans unexpectedly landed in the port of Ravenna To these valiant strangers whose fidelity had not been corrupted by the factions of the court he committed the walls and gates of the city and the slumbers of the emperor were no longer disturbed by the apprehension of imminent and internal danger The favourable intelligence which was received from Africa suddenly changed the opinions of men and the state of public affairs The troops and officers whom Attalus had sent into that province were defeated and slain and the active zeal of Heraclian maintained his own allegiance and that of his people The faithful count of Africa transmitted a large sum of money which fixed the attachment of the Imperial guards and his vigilance in preventing the exportation of corn and oil introduced famine tumult and discontent into the walls of Rome The failure of the  African expedition was the source of mutual complaint and recrimination in the party of Attalus and the mind of his protector was insensibly alienated from the interest of a prince who wanted spirit to command or docility to obey The most imprudent measures were adopted without the knowledge or against the advice of Alaric and the obstinate refusal of the senate to allow in the embarkation the mixture even of five hundred Goths betrayed a suspicious and distrustful temper which in their situation was neither generous nor prudent The resentment of the Gothic king was exasperated by the malicious arts of Jovius who had been raised to the rank of patrician and who afterwards excused his double perfidy by declaring without a blush that he had only  seemed  to abandon the service of Honorius more effectually to ruin the cause of the usurper In a large plain near Rimini and in the presence of an innumerable multitude of Romans and Barbarians the wretched Attalus was publicly despoiled of the diadem and purple and those ensigns of royalty were sent by Alaric as the pledge of peace and friendship to the son of Theodosius  See the cause and circumstances of the fall of Attalus in Zosimus l vi p Sozomen l ix c Philostorg l xii c The two acts of indemnity in the

of the Imperial ministers whose insolence soon returned with the return of fortune His indignation was kindled by the report that a rival chieftain that Sarus the personal enemy of Adolphus and the hereditary foe of the house of Balti had been received into the palace At the head of three hundred followers that fearless Barbarian immediately sallied from the gates of Ravenna surprised and cut in pieces a considerable body of Goths reentered the city in triumph and was permitted to insult his adversary by the voice of a herald who publicly declared that the guilt of Alaric had for ever excluded him from the friendship and alliance of the emperor  Zosimus l vi p Sozomen l ix c Philostorgius l xii c In this place the text of Zosimus is mutilated and we have iost the remainder of his sixth and last book which ended with the sack of Rome Credulous and partial as he is we must take cur leave of that historian with some regret  The crime and folly of the court of Ravenna was expiated a third time by the calamities of Rome The king of the Goths who no longer dissembled his appetite for plunder  and revenge appeared in arms under the walls of the capital and the trembling senate without any hopes of relief prepared by a desperate resistance to delay the ruin of their country But they were unable to guard against the secret conspiracy of their slaves and domestics who either from birth or interest were attached to the cause of the enemy At the hour of midnight the Salarian gate was silently opened and the inhabitants were awakened by the tremendous sound of the Gothic trumpet Eleven hundred and sixtythree years after the foundation of Rome the Imperial city which had subdued and civilised so considerable a part of mankind was delivered to the licentious fury of the tribes of Germany and Scythia  Adest Alaricus trepidam Roman obsidet turbat irrumpit Orosius l vii c p He dispatches this great event in seven words but he employs whole pages in celebrating the devotion of the Goths I have extracted from an improbable story of Procopius the circumstances which had an air of probability Procop de Bell Vandal l i c He supposes that the city was surprised while the senators slept in the afternoon but Jerom with more authority and more reason affirms that it was in the night nocte Moab capta est nocte cecidit murus ejus tom i p ad Principiam    The proclamation of Alaric when he forced his  Respect of the Goths for the Christian religion  entrance into a vanquished city discovered however some regard for the laws of humanity and religion He encouraged his troops boldly to seize the rewards of valour and to enrich themselves with the spoils of a wealthy and effeminate people but he exhorted them at the same time to spare the lives of the unresisting citizens and  to respect the churches of the apostles St Peter and St Paul as holy and inviolable sanctuaries Amidst the horrors of a nocturnal tumult several of the Christian Goths displayed the fervour of a recent conversion and some instances of their uncommon piety and moderation are related and perhaps adorned by the zeal of ecclesiastical writers  Orosius l vii c p applauds the piety of the Christian Goths without seeming to perceive that the greatest part of them were Arian heretics Jornandes c p and Isidore of Seville Chron p edit Grot who were both attached to the Gothic cause have repeated and embellished these edifying tales According to Isidore Alaric himself was heard to say that he waged war with the Romans and not with the Apostles Such was the style of the seventh century two hundred years before the fame and merit had been ascribed not to the apostles but to Christ  While the Barbarians roamed through the city in quest of prey the humble dwelling of an aged virgin who had devoted her life to the service of the altar was forced open by one of the powerful Goths He immediately demanded though in civil language all the gold and silver in her possession and was astonished at the readiness with which she conducted him to a splendid hoard of massy plate of the richest materials and the most curious workmanship The Barbarian viewed with wonder and delight this valuable acquisition till he was interrupted by a serious admonition addressed to him in the following words  "These said she are the consecrated vessels belonging to St Peter if you presume to touch them the sacrilegious deed will remain on your conscience For my part I dare not keep what I am unable to  defend"  The Gothic captain struck with reverential awe dispatched a messenger to inform the king of the treasure which he had discovered and received a peremptory order from Alaric that all the consecrated plate and ornaments should be transported without damage or delay to the church of the apostle From the extremity perhaps of the Quirinal hill to the distant quarter of the Vatican a numerous detachment of Goths marching in order of battle through the principal streets protected with glittering arms the long train of their devout companions who bore aloft on their heads the sacred vessels of gold and silver and the martial shouts of the Barbarians were mingled with the sound of religious psalmody From all the adjacent houses a crowd of Christians hastened to join this edifying procession and a multitude of fugitives without distinction of age or rank or even of sect had the good fortune to escape to the secure and hospitable sanctuary of the Vatican The learned work concerning the  City of God  was professedly composed by St Augustin to justify the ways of Providence in the destruction of the Roman greatness He celebrates with peculiar satisfaction this memorable triumph of Christ and insults his adversaries by challenging them to produce some similar example of a town taken by storm in which the fabulous gods of antiquity had been able to protect either themselves or their deluded votaries  See Augustin de Civitat Dei l i c He particularly appeals to the examples of Troy Syracuse and Tarentum    In the sack of Rome some rare and extraordinary examples of Barbarian virtue had been  Pillage and fire of Rome  deservedly applauded But the holy precincts of the Vatican and the apostolic churches could receive a very small proportion of the Roman people many thousand warriors more especially of the Huns who served under the standard of Alaric were strangers to the name or at least to the faith of Christ and we may suspect without any breach of charity or candour that in the hour of savage licence when every passion was inflamed and every restraint was removed the precepts of the gospel seldom influenced the behaviour of the Gothic Christians The writers the best disposed to exaggerate their clemency have freely confessed that a cruel slaughter was made of the Romans  Jerom tom i p ad Principiam has applied to the sack of Rome all the strong expressions of Virgil  Quis cladem illius noctis quis funera fando  Explicet c  Procopius l i c positively affirms that great numbers were slain by the Goths Augustin de Civ Dei l i c offers Christian comfort for the death of those whose bodies  multa corpora  had remained  in tantâ strage  unburied Baronius from the different writings of the Fathers has thrown some light on the sack of Rome Annal Eccles A D No  and that the streets of the city were filled with dead bodies which remained without burial during the general consternation The despair of the citizens was sometimes converted into fury and whenever the Barbarians were provoked by opposition they extended the promiscuous massacre to the feeble the innocent and the helpless The private  revenge of forty thousand slaves was exercised without pity or remorse and the ignominious lashes which they had formerly received were washed away in the blood of the guilty or obnoxious families The matrons and virgins of Rome were exposed to injuries more dreadful in the apprehension of chastity than death itself and the ecclesiastical historian has selected an example of female virtue for the admiration of future ages  Sozomen l ix c Augustin de Civitat Dei l i c intimates that some virgins or matrons actually killed themselves to escape violation and though he admires their spirit he is obliged by his theology to condemn their rash presumption Perhaps the good bishop of Hippo was too easy in the belief as well as too rigid in the censure of this act of female heroism The twenty maidens if they ever existed who threw themselves into the Elbe when Magdeburgh was taken by storm have been multiplied to the number of twelve hundred See Harte's History of Gustavus Adolphus vol i p  A Roman lady of singular beauty and orthodox faith had excited the impatient desires of a young Goth who according to the sagacious remark of Sozomen was attached to the Arian heresy Exasperated by her obstinate resistance he drew his sword and with the anger of a lover slightly wounded her neck The bleeding heroine still continued to brave his resentment and to repel his love till the ravisher desisted from his unavailing efforts respectfully conducted her to the sanctuary of the Vatican and gave six pieces of gold to the guards of the church on condition that they should restore her inviolate to the arms of her husband Such instances of courage and generosity were not extremely  common The brutal soldiers satisfied their sensual appetites without consulting either the inclination or the duties of their female captives and a nice question of casuistry was seriously agitated Whether those tender victims who had inflexibly refused their consent to the violation which they sustained had lost by their misfortune the glorious crown of virginity  See Augustin de Civitat Dei l i c He treats the subject with remarkable accuracy and after admitting that there cannot be any crime where there is no consent he adds Sed quia non solum quod ad dolorem verum etiam quod ad libidinem pertinet in corpore alieno perpetrari potest quicquid tale factum fuerit etsi retentam constantissimo animo pudicitiam non excutit pudorem tamen incutit ne credatur factum cum mentis etiam voluntate

more general concern It cannot be presumed that all the Barbarians were at at all times capable of perpetrating such amorous outrages and the want of youth or beauty or chastity protected the greatest part of the Roman women from the danger of a rape But avarice is an insatiate and universal passion since the enjoyment of almost every object that can afford pleasure to the different tastes and tempers of mankind may be procured by the possession of wealth In the pillage of Rome a just preference was given to gold and jewels which contain the greatest value in the smallest compass and weight but after these portable riches had been removed by the more diligent robbers the palaces of Rome were rudely stripped of their splendid  and costly furniture The sideboards of massy plate and the variegated wardrobes of silk and purple were irregularly piled in the waggons that always followed the march of a Gothic army The most exquisite works of art were roughly handled or wantonly destroyed many a statue was melted for the sake of the precious materials and many a vase in the division of the spoil was shivered into fragments by the stroke of a battleaxe The acquisition of riches served only to stimulate the avarice of the rapacious Barbarians who proceeded by threats by blows and by tortures to force from their prisoners the confession of hidden treasure  Marcella a Roman lady

The modern Sacco di Roma p gives an idea of the various methods of torturing prisoners for gold  Visible splendour and expence were alleged as the proof of a plentiful fortune the appearance of poverty was imputed to a parsimonious disposition and the obstinacy of some misers who endured the most cruel torments before they would discover the secret object of their affection was fatal to many unhappy wretches who expired under the lash for refusing to reveal their imaginary treasures The edifices of Rome though the damage has been much exaggerated received some injury from the violence of the Goths At their entrance through the Salarian gate they fired the adjacent houses to guide their march and to distract the attention of the citizens the flames  which encountered no obstacle in the

 Yet a contemporary historian has observed that fire could scarcely consume the enormous beams of solid brass and that the strength of man was insufficient to subvert the foundations of ancient structures Some truth may possibly be concealed in his devout assertion that the wrath of Heaven supplied the imperfections of hostile rage and that the proud Forum of Rome decorated with the statues of so many gods and heroes was levelled in the dust by the stroke of lightning  Orosius l ii c p He speaks as if he disapproved  all  statues vel Deum vel hominem mentiuntur They consisted of the kings of Alba and Rome from Aeneas the Romans illustrious either in arms or arts and the deified Caesars The expression which he uses of  Forum  is somewhat ambiguous since there existed  five  principal  Fora  but as they were all contiguous and adjacent in the plain which is surrounded by the Capitoline the Quirinal the Esquiline and the Palatine hills they might fairly be considered as  one  See the Roma Antiqua of Donatus p and the Roma Antica of Nardini p The former is more useful for the ancient descriptions the latter for the actual topography    Whatever might be the numbers of equestrian or plebeian rank who perished in the massacre of Rome it is confidently affirmed that only one  Captives and fugitives  senator lost his life by the sword of the enemy  Orosius l ii c p compares the cruelty of the Gauls and the clemency of the Goths Ibi vix quemquam inventum senatorem qui vel absens evaserit hic vix quemquam requiri qui forte ut latens perierit But there is an air of rhetoric and perhaps of falsehood in this antithesis and Socrates l vii c affirms perhaps by an opposite exaggeration that  many  senators were put to death with various and exquisite tortures  But it was not easy to compute the multitudes who from an honourable station and a prosperous fortune were suddenly reduced to the miserable condition of captives and exiles As the Barbarians had more occasion for money than for slaves they fixed at a moderate price the redemption of their indigent prisoners and the ransom was often paid by the benevolence of their friends or the charity of strangers  Multi Christiani in captivitatem ducti sunt Augustin de Civ Dei l i c and the Christians experienced no peculiar hardships  The captives who were regularly sold either in open market or by private contract would have legally regained their native freedom which it was impossible for a citizen to lose or to alienate  See Heineccius Antiquitat Juris Roman tom i p  But as it was soon discovered that the vindication of their liberty would endanger their lives and that the Goths unless they were tempted to sell might be provoked to murder their useless prisoners the civil jurisprudence had been already qualified by a wise regulation that they should be  obliged to serve the moderate term of five years till they had discharged by their labour the price of their

besieged and taken by the Goths Proba supported with Christian resignation the loss of immense riches embarked in a small vessel from whence she beheld at sea the flames of her burning palace and fled with her daughter Laeta and her granddaughter the celebrated virgin Demetrias to the coast of Africa The benevolent profusion with which the matron distributed the fruits or the price of her estates contributed to alleviate the misfortunes of exile and captivity But even the family of Proba herself was not exempt from the rapacious oppression of Count Heraclian who basely sold in matrimonial prostitution  the noblest maidens of Rome to the lust or avarice of the Syrian merchants The Italian fugitives were dispersed through the provinces along the coast of Egypt and Asia as far as Constantinople and Jerusalem and the village of Bethlem the solitary residence of St Jerom and his female converts was crowded with illustrious beggars of either sex and every age who excited the public compassion by the remembrance of their past fortune  See the pathetic complaint of Jerom tom v p in his preface to the second book of his Commentaries on the prophet Ezekiel  This awful catastrophe of Rome filled the astonished empire with grief and terror So interesting a contrast of greatness and ruin disposed the fond credulity of the people to deplore and even to exaggerate the afflictions of the queen of cities The clergy who applied to recent events the lofty metaphors of Oriental prophecy were sometimes tempted to confound the destruction of the capital and the dissolution of the globe  There exists in human nature a strong propensity  Sack of Rome by the troops of Charles V  to depreciate the advantages and to magnify the evils of the present times Yet when the first emotions had subsided and a fair estimate was made of the real damage the more learned and judicious contemporaries were forced to confess that infant Rome had formerly received more essential injury from the Gauls than she had now sustained from the Goths in her declining age  Orosius though with some theological partiality states this comparison l ii c p l vii c p But in the history of the taking of Rome by the Gauls every thing is uncertain and perhaps fabulous See Beaufort sur l'Incertitude c de l'Histoire Romaine p and Melot in the Mem de l'Academie des Inscript tom xv

banks of the Danube were less destructive than the hostilities exercised by the troops of Charles the Fifth a Catholic prince who styled himself Emperor of the Romans  The reader who wishes to inform himself of the circumstances of this famous event may peruse an admirable narrative in Dr Robertson's History of Charles V vol ii p or consult the Annali d'Italia of the learned Muratori tom xiv p octavo edition If he is desirous of examining the originals he may have recourse to the eighteenth book of the great but unfinished history of Guicciardini But the account which most truly deserves the name of authentic and original is a little book intitled  Il Sacco di Roma  composed within less than a month after the assault of the city by the  brother  of the historian Guicciardini who appears to have been an able magistrate and a dispassionate writer  The Goths evacuated the city at the end of six days but Rome remained above nine months in the possession of the Imperialists and every hour was stained by some atrocious act of cruelty lust and rapine The authority of Alaric preserved some order and moderation among the ferocious multitude which acknowledged him for their leader and king but the constable of Bourbon had gloriously fallen in the attack of the walls and the death of the general removed every restraint of discipline from an army which consisted of three independent nations the Italians the Spaniards and the Germans In the beginning  of the sixteenth century the manners of Italy exhibited a remarkable scene of the depravity of mankind They united the sanguinary crimes that prevail in an unsettled state of society with the polished vices which spring from the abuse of art and luxury and the loose adventurers who had violated every prejudice of patriotism and superstition to assault the palace of the Roman pontiff must deserve to be considered as the most profligate of the  Italians  At the same aera the  Spaniards  were the terror both of the Old and New World but their highspirited valour was disgraced by gloomy pride rapacious avarice and unrelenting cruelty Indefatigable in the pursuit of fame and riches they had improved by repeated practice the most exquisite and effectual methods of torturing their prisoners many of the Castillans who pillaged Rome were familiars of the holy inquisition and some volunteers perhaps were lately returned from the conquest of Mexico The  Germans  were less corrupt than the Italians less cruel than the Spaniards and the rustic or even savage aspect of those  Tramontane  warriors often disguised a simple and merciful disposition But they had imbibed in the first fervour of the reformation the spirit as well as the principles of Luther It was their favourite amusement to insult or destroy the consecrated objects of Catholic superstition they indulged without pity or remorse a devout hatred against the clergy of every denomination and degree who form so considerable a part of  the inhabitants of modern Rome and their fanatic zeal might aspire to subvert the throne of Antichrist to purify with blood and fire the abominations of the spiritual Babylon  The furious spirit of

successively a consul a monk and a bishop At the age of forty he renounced the enjoyment of wealth and honour of society and literature to embrace a life of solitude and pennance and the loud applause

Faelix which the public devotion had already surrounded with five large and populous churches The remains of his fortune and of his understanding were dedicated to the service of the glorious martyr whose praise on the day of his festival Paulinus never failed to celebrate by a solemn hymn and in whose name he erected a sixth church of superior elegance and beauty which was decorated with many curious pictures from the History of the Old and New Testament Such assiduous zeal secured the favour of the saint  The humble Paulinus once presumed to say that he believed St Faelix  did  love him at least as a master loves his little dog  or at least of the people and after  fifteen years retirement the Roman consul was compelled to accept the bishopric of Nola a few months before the city was invested by the Goths During the siege some religious persons were satisfied that they had seen either in dreams or visions the divine form of their tutelar patron yet it soon appeared by the event

without controul over a country which in the opinion of the ancients had united all the various excellencies of nature and art The prosperity indeed which Italy had attained in the auspicious age of the Antonines had gradually declined with the decline of the empire The fruits of a long peace perished under the rude grasp of the Barbarians and they themselves were incapable of tasting the more elegant refinements of luxury which had been prepared for the use of the soft and polished Italians Each soldier however claimed an ample portion of the substantial plenty  the corn and cattle oil and

king of the Goths concludes a peace with the empire and marches into Gaul A D  of the Barbarians were suspended by the strong necessity of their affairs and the brave Adolphus the brotherinlaw of the deceased monarch was unanimously elected to succeed to his throne The character and political system of the new king of the Goths may be best understood from his own conversation with an illustrious citizen of Narbonne who afterwards in a pilgrimage to the Holy Land related it to St Jerom in the presence of the historian Orosius  "In the full confidence of valour and victory I once aspired said Adolphus to change the face of the universe to obliterate the name of Rome to erect on its ruins the dominion of the Goths and to acquire like Augustus the immortal fame of the founder of a new empire By repeated experiments I was gradually convinced that laws are essentially necessary to maintain and regulate a wellconstituted state and that the fierce untractable humour of the Goths was incapable of bearing the salutary yoke of  laws and civil government From that moment I proposed to myself a different object of glory and ambition and it is now my sincere wish that the gratitude of future ages should acknowledge the merit of a stranger who employed the sword of the Goths not to subvert but to restore and maintain the prosperity of the Roman empire  Orosius l vii c p He was sent by St Augustin in the year from Africa to Palestine to visit St Jerom and to consult with him on the subject of the Pelagian controversy  "  With these pacific views the successor of Alaric suspended the operations of war and seriously negociated with the Imperial court a treaty of friendship and alliance It was the interest of the ministers of Honorius who were now released from the obligation of their extravagant oath to deliver Italy from the intolerable weight of the Gothic powers and they readily accepted their service against the tyrants and Barbarians who infested the provinces beyond the Alps  Jornandes supposes without much probability that Adolphus visited and plundered Rome a second time more locustarum erasit Yet he agrees with Orosius in supposing that a treaty of peace was concluded between the Gothic prince and Honorius See Oros l vii c p Jornandes de Reb Geticis c p  Adolphus assuming the character of a Roman general directed his march from the extremity of Campania to the southern provinces of Gaul His troops either by force or agreement immediately occupied the cities of Narbonne Thoulouse and Bourdeaux and though they were repulsed by Count Boniface from the walls of Marseilles they soon extended  their quarters from the Mediterranean to the Ocean The oppressed provincials might exclaim that the miserable remnant which the enemy had spared was cruelly ravished by their pretended allies yet some specious colours were not wanting to palliate or justify the violence of the Goths The cities of Gaul which they attacked might perhaps be considered as in a state of rebellion against the government of Honorius the articles of the treaty or the secret instructions of the court might sometimes be alleged in favour of the seeming usurpations of Adolphus and the guilt of any irregular unsuccessful act of hostility might always be imputed with an appearance of truth to the ungovernable spirit of a Barbarian host impatient of peace or discipline The luxury of Italy had been less effectual to soften the temper than to relax the courage of the Goths and they had imbibed the vices without imitating the arts and institutions of civilised society  The retreat of the Goths from Italy and their first transactions in Gaul are dark and doubtful I have derived much assistance from Mascou Hist of the ancient Germans l viii c who has illustrated and connected the broken chronicles and fragments of the times    The professions of Adolphus were probably sincere and his attachment to the cause of the republic  His marriage with Placidia A D  was

connected with the revolutions which agitated the Western empire under the reign of her brother Honorius When Rome was first invested by the arms of Alaric Placidia who was then about twenty years of age resided in the city and her ready consent to the death of her cousin Serena has a cruel and ungrateful appearance which according to the circumstances of the action may be aggravated or excused by the consideration of her tender age  Zosim l v p  The victorious Barbarians detained either as a hostage or a captive  Zosim l vi p Orosius l vii c p and the Chronicles of Marcellinus and Idatius seem to suppose that the Goths did not carry away Placidia till after the last siege of Rome  the sister of Honorius but while she was exposed to the disgrace of following round Italy the motions of a Gothic camp she experienced however a decent and respectful treatment The authority of Jornandes who praises the beauty of Placidia may perhaps be counterbalanced by the silence the expressive silence of her flatterers yet the splendour of her birth the bloom of youth the elegance of manners and the dexterous insinuation which she condescended to employ made a deep impression on the mind of Adolphus and the Gothic king aspired to call himself the brother of the emperor The ministers of Honorius rejected with disdain the proposal of an alliance so injurious to every  sentiment of Roman pride and repeatedly urged the restitution of Placidia as an indispensable condition of the treaty of peace But the daughter of Theodosius submitted without reluctance to the desires of the conqueror

the event yet his authority seems to be overbalanced by the improbability of the fact The Chronicle of Marcellinus gives Heraclian ships and men the latter of these numbers is ridiculously corrupt but the former would please me very much  Yet with such an armament which might have subverted or restored the greatest empires of the earth the African usurper made a very faint and feeble impression on the provinces of his rival As he marched from the port along the road which leads to the gates of Rome he was encountered terrifled and routed by one of the Imperial captains and the lord of this mighty host deserting his fortune and his friends ignominiously fled with a single ship  The Chronicle of Idatius affirms without the least appearance of truth that he advanced as far as Otriculum in Umbria where he was overthrown in a great battle with the loss of fifty thousand men  When Heraclian landed in the harbour of Carthage he found that the whole province disdaining such an unworthy ruler had returned to their allegiance The rebel was beheaded in the ancient temple of Memory his consulship was abolished  See Cod Theod l xv tit xiv leg The legal acts performed in his name even the manumission of slaves were declared invalid till they had been formally repeated  and the remains of his private fortune not exceeding the moderate sum of four thousand pounds of gold were granted to the brave Constantius who had already defended the throne which he afterwards shared with his feeble sovereign Honorius viewed with supine indifference the calamities of Rome  nd Italy  I have disdained to mention a very foolish and probably a false report Procop de Bell Vandal l i c that Honorius was alarmed by the  loss  of Rome till he understood that it was not a favourite chicken of that name but  only  the capital of the world which had been lost Yet even this story is some evidence of the public opinion  but the rebellious attempts of Attalus and Heraclian against his personal safety awakened for a moment the torpid instinct of his nature He was probably ignorant of the causes and events which preserved him from these impending dangers and as Italy was no longer invaded by any foreign or domestic enemies he peaceably existed in the palace of Ravenna while the tyrants beyond the Alps were repeatedly vanquished in the name and by the lieutenants of the son of Theodosius  The materials for the lives of all these tyrants are taken from six contemporary historians two Latins and four Greeks Orosius l vii c p Renatus Profuturus Frigeridus apud Gregor Turon l ii c in the historians of France tom ii p Zosimus l vi p Olympiodorus apud Phot p Sozomen l ix c and Philostorgius l xii c with Godefroy's Dissertations p besides the four Chronicles of Prosper Tyro Prosper of Aquitain Idatius and Marcellinus  In the course of a busy and interesting narrative I might possibly forget to mention the death of such a prince and I shall therefore take the precaution of observing in this place that he survived the last siege of Rome about thirteen years  The usurpation of Constantine who received  Revolutions of Gaul and Spain A D  the purple from the legions of Britain had been successful and seemed to be secure His title was acknowledged from the wall of Antoninus to the columns of Hercules and in the midst  of the public disorder he shared the dominion and the plunder of Gaul and Spain with the tribes of Barbarians whose destructive progress was no longer checked by the Rhine or Pyrenees Stained with the blood of the kinsmen of Honorius he extorted from the court of Ravenna with which he secretly corresponded the ratification of his rebellious claims Constantine engaged himself by a solemn promise to deliver Italy from the Goths advanced as far as the banks of the Po and after alarming rather than assisting his pusillanimous ally hastily returned to the palace of Arles to celebrate with intemperate luxury his vain and ostentatious triumph But this transient prosperity was soon interrupted and destroyed by the revolt of count Gerontius the bravest of his generals who during the absence of his son Constans a prince already invested with the Imperial purple had been left to command in the provinces of Spain For some reason of which we are ignorant Gerontius instead of assuming the diadem placed it on the head of his friend Maximus who fixed his residence at Tarragona while the active count pressed forwards through the Pyrenees to surprise the two emperors Constantine and Constans before they could prepare for their defence The son was made prisoner at Vienna and immediately put to death and the unfortunate youth had scarcely leisure to deplore the elevation of his family which had tempted or compelled him sacrilegiously to desert the peaceful obscurity of the monastic life The father maintained a siege within  the walls of Arles but those walls must have yielded to the assailants had not the city been unexpectedly relieved by the approach of an Italian army The name of Honorius the proclamation of a lawful emperor astonished the contending parties of the rebels Gerontius abandoned by his own troops escaped to the confines of Spain and rescued his name from oblivion by the Roman courage which appeared to animate the last moments of his life In the middle of the night a great body of his perfidious soldiers surrounded and attacked his house which he had strongly barricaded His wife a valiant friend of the nation of the Alani and some faithful slaves were still attached to his person and he used with so much skill and resolution a large magazine of darts and arrows that above three hundred of the assailants lost their lives in the attempt His slaves when all the missile weapons were spent fled at the dawn of day and Gerontius if he had not been restrained by conjugal tenderness might have imitated their example till the soldiers provoked by such obstinate resistance applied fire on all sides to the house In this fatal extremity he complied with the request of his Barbarian friend and cut off his head The wife of Gerontius who conjured him not to abandon her to a life of misery and disgrace eagerly presented her neck to his sword and the tragic scene was terminated by the death of the count himself who after three ineffectual strokes drew a short dagger and sheathed it in  his heart  The praises which Sozomen has bestowed on this act of despair appear strange and scandalous in the mouth of an ecclesiastical historian He observes p that the wife of Gerontius was a  Christian  and that her death was worthy of her religion and of immortal fame  The unprotected Maximus whom he had invested with the purple was indebted for his life to the contempt that was entertained of his power and abilities The caprice of the Barbarians who ravaged Spain once more seated this Imperial phantom on the throne but they soon resigned him to the justice of Honorius and the tyrant Maximus after he had been shewn to the people of Ravenna and Rome was publicly executed  The general Constantius was his name who  Character and victories of the general Constantius  raised by his approach the siege of Arles and dissipated the troops of Gerontius was born a Roman and this remarkable distinction is strongly expressive of the decay of military spirit among the subjects of the empire The strength and majesty which were conspicuous in the person of that general  is the expression of Olympiodorus which he seems to have borrowed from  Aeolus  a tragedy of Euripides of which some fragments only are now extant Euripid Barnes tom ii p ver This allusion may prove that the ancient tragic poets were still familiar to the Greeks of the fifth century  marked him in the popular opinion as a candidate worthy of the throne which he afterwards ascended In the familiar intercourse of private life his manners were cheerful and engaging nor would he sometimes disdain in the licence of convivial mirth to vie  with the pantomimes themselves in the exercises of their ridiculous profession But when the trumpet summoned him to arms when he mounted his horse and bending down for such was his singular practice almost upon the neck fiercely rolled his large animated eyes round the field Constantius then struck terror into his foes and inspired his soldiers with the assurance of victory He had received from the court of Ravenna the important commission of extirpating rebellion in the provinces of the West and the pretended emperor Constantine after enjoying a short and anxious respite was again besieged in his capital by the arms of a more formidable enemy Yet this interval allowed time for a successful negociation with the Franks and Alemanni and his ambassador Edobic soon returned at the head of an army to disturb the operations of the siege of Arles The Roman general instead of expecting the attack in his lines boldly and perhaps wisely resolved to pass the Rhône and to meet the Barbarians His measures were conducted with so much skill and secrecy that while they engaged the infantry of Constantius in the front they were suddenly attacked surrounded and destroyed by the cavalry of his lieutenant Ulphilas who had silently gained an advantageous post in their rear The remains of the army of Edobic were preserved by flight or submission and their leader escaped from the field of battle to the house of a faithless friend who too clearly understood that the head of his  obnoxious guest would be an acceptable and lucrative present for the Imperial general On this occasion Constantius behaved with the magnanimity of a genuine Roman Subduing or suppressing every sentiment of jealousy he publicly acknowledged the merit and services of Ulphilas but he turned with horror from the assassin of Edobic and sternly intimated his commands that the camp should no longer be polluted by the presence of an ungrateful wretch who had violated the laws of friendship and hospitality The usurper who beheld from the walls of Arles the ruin of his last hopes was tempted to place some confidence in so generous a conqueror He required a solemn promise for his security and after receiving by the imposition of hands the sacred character of a Christian Presbyter he ventured to open the gates of the city But he soon experienced that the principles of honour and integrity which might regulate the ordinary conduct of Constantius were superseded by the loose doctrines of political morality The Roman  Death of the usurper Constantine A D Nov  general indeed refused to sully his laurels with the blood of Constantine but the abdicated emperor and his son Julian were sent under a strong guard into Italy and before they reached the palace of Ravenna they met the ministers of death  At a time when it was universally confessed  Fall of the usurpers Jovinus Sebastian and Attaius A D  that almost every man in the empire was superior in personal merit to the princes whom the accident of their birth had seated on the throne a  rapid succession of usurpers regardless of the fate of their predecessors still continued to arise This mischief was peculiarly felt in the provinces of Spain and Gaul where the principles of order and obedience had been extinguished by war and rebellion Before Constantine resigned the purple and in the fourth month of the siege of Arles intelligence was received in the Imperial camp that Jovinus had assumed the diadem at Mentz in the Upper Germany at the instigation of Goar king of the Alani and of Guntiarius king of the Burgundians and that the candidate on whom they had bestowed the empire advanced with a formidable host of Barbarians from the banks of the Rhine to those of the Rhône Every circumstance is dark and extraordinary in the short history of the reign of Jovinus It was natural to expect that a brave and skilful general at the head of a victorious army would have asserted in a field of battle the justice of the cause of Honorius The hasty retreat of Constantius might be justified by weighty reasons but he resigned without a struggle the possession of Gaul and Dardanus the Praetorian praefect is recorded as the only magistrate who refused to yield obedience to the usurper  Sidonius Apollinaris l v epist p and Not Sirmond p after stigmatising the  inconstancy  of Constantine the  facility  of Jovinus the  perfidy  of Gerontius continues to observe that  all  the vices of these tyrants were united in the person of Dardanus Yet the praefect supported a respectable character in the world and even in the church held a devout correspondence with St Augustin and St Jerom and was complimented by the latter tom iii p with the epithets of Christianorum Nobilissime and Nobilium Christianissime    When the Goths two years after the siege of Rome established their quarters in Gaul it was natural to suppose that their inclinations could be divided only between the emperor Honorius with whom they had formed a recent alliance and the degraded Attalus whom they reserved in their camp for the occasional purpose of acting the part of a musician or a monarch Yet in a moment of disgust for which it is not easy to assign a cause or a date Adolphus connected himself with the usurper of Gaul and imposed on Attalus the ignominious task of negociating the treaty which ratified his own disgrace We are again surprised to read that instead of considering the Gothic alliance as the firmest support of his throne Jovinus upbraided in dark and ambiguous language the officious importunity of Attalus that scorning the advice of his great ally he invested with the purple his brother Sebastian and that he most imprudently accepted the service of Sarus when that gallant chief the soldier of Honorius was provoked to desert the court of a prince who knew not how to reward or punish Adolphus educated among a race of warriors who esteemed the duty of revenge as the most precious and sacred portion of their inheritance advanced with a body of ten thousand Goths to encounter the hereditary enemy of the house of Balti He attacked Sarus at an unguarded moment when he was accompanied only by eighteen or twenty of his valiant followers United by friendship animated by despair but  at length oppressed by multitudes this band of heroes deserved the esteem without exciting the compassion of their enemies and the lion was no sooner taken in the toils  The expression may be understood almost literally Olympiodorus say  or  may signify a sack or a loose garment and this method of entangling and catching an enemy laciniis contortis was much practised by the Huns Ammian xxxi Il fut pris vif avec des filets is the translation of Tillemont Hist des Empereurs tom v p  than he was instantly dispatched The death of Sarus dissolved the loose alliance which Adolphus still maintained with the usurpers of Gaul He again listened to the dictates of love and prudence and soon satisfied the brother of Placidia by the assurance that he would immediately transmit to the palace of Ravenna the heads of the two tyrants Jovinus and Sebastian The king of the Goths executed his promise without difficulty or delay the helpless brothers unsupported by any personal merit were abandoned by their Barbarian auxiliaries and the short opposition of Valentia was expiated by the ruin of one of the noblest cities of Gaul The emperor chosen by the Roman senate who had been promoted degraded insulted restored again degraded and again insulted was finally abandoned to his fate but when the Gothic king withdrew his protection he was restrained by pity or contempt from offering any violence to the person of Attalus The unfortunate Attalus who was left without subjects or allies embarked in one of the ports of Spain in search of some secure and solitary  retreat but he was intercepted at sea conducted to the presence of Honorius led in triumph through the streets of Rome or Ravenna and publicly exposed to the gazing multitude on the second step of the throne of his  invincible  conqueror The same measure of punishment with which in the days of his prosperity he was accused of menacing his rival was inflicted on Attalus himself he was condemned after the amputation of two fingers to a perpetual exile in the isle of Lipari where he was supplied with the decent necessaries of life The remainder of the reign of Honorius was undisturbed by rebellion and it may be observed that in the space of five years seven usurpers had yielded to the fortune of a prince who was himself incapable either of counsel or of action  The situation of Spain separated on all sides  Invasion of Spain by the Suevi Vandals Alani c A D Oct  from the enemies of Rome by the sea by the mountains and by intermediate provinces had secured the long tranquillity of that remote and sequestered country and we may observe as a sure symptom of domestic happiness that in a period of four hundred years Spain furnished very few materials to the history of the Roman empire The footsteps of the Barbarians who in the reign of Gallienus had penetrated beyond the Pyrenees were soon obliterated by the return of peace and in the fourth century of the Christian aera the cities of Emerita or Merida of Corduba Seville Bracara and Tarragona were numbered with the most illustrious of the Roman  world The various plenty of the animal the vegetable and the mineral kingdoms was improved and manufactured by the skill of an industrious people and the peculiar advantages of naval stores contributed to support an extensive and profitable trade  Without recurring to the more ancient writers I shall quote three respectable testimonies which belong to the fourth and seventh centuries the Expositio totius Mundi p in the third volume of Hudson's Minor Geographers Ausonius de Claris Urbibus p edit Toll and Isidore of Seville Praefat ad Chron ap Grotium Hist Goth p Many particulars relative to the fertility and trade of Spain may be found in Nonnius Hispania Illustrata and in Huet Hist du Commerce des Anciens c p  The arts and sciences flourished under the protection of the emperors and if the character of the Spaniards was enfeebled by peace and servitude the hostile approach of the Germans who had spread terror and desolation from the Rhine to the Pyrenees seemed to rekindle some sparks of military ardour As long as the defence of the mountains was entrusted to the hardy and faithful militia of the country they successfully repelled the frequent attempts of the Barbarians But no sooner had the national troops been compelled to resign their post to the Honorian bands in the service of Constantine than the gates of Spain were treacherously betrayed to the public enemy about ten months before the sack of Rome by the Goths  The date is accurately fixed in the Fasti and the Chronicle of Idatius Orosius l vii c p imputes the loss of Spain to the treachery of the Honorians while Sozomen l ix c accuses only their negligence  The consciousness of guilt and the  thirst of rapine prompted the mercenary guards of the Pyrenees to desert their station to invite the arms of the Suevi the Vandals and the Alani and to swell the torrent which was poured with irresistible violence from the frontiers of Gaul to the sea of Africa The misfortunes of Spain may be described in the language of its most eloquent historian who has concisely expressed the passionate and perhaps exaggerated declamations of contemporary writers  Idatius wishes to apply the Prophecies of Daniel to these national calamities and is therefore obliged to accommodate the circumstances of the event to the terms of the prediction    "The irruption of these nations was followed by the most dreadful calamities as the Barbarians exercised their indiscriminate cruelty on the fortunes of the Romans and the Spaniards and ravaged with equal fury the cities and the open country The progress of famine reduced the miserable inhabitants to feed on the flesh of their fellowcreatures and even the wild beasts who multiplied without controul in the desert were exasperated by the taste of blood and the impatience of hunger boldly to attack and devour their human prey Pestilence soon appeared the inseparable companion of famine a large proportion of the people was swept away and the groans of the dying excited only the envy of their surviving friends At length the Barbarians satiated with carnage and rapine and afflicted by the contagious evils which they themselves had introduced fixed their permanent seats in the  depopulated country The ancient Gallicia whose limits included the kingdom of Old Castille was divided between the Suevi and the Vandals the Alani were scattered over the provinces of Carthagena and Lusitania from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic Ocean and the fruitful territory of Boetica was allotted to the Silingi another branch of the Vandalic nation After regulating this partition the conquerors contracted with their new subjects some reciprocal engagements of protection and obedience the lands were again cultivated and the towns and villages were again occupied by a captive people The greatest part of the Spaniards was even disposed to prefer this new condition of poverty and barbarism to the severe oppressions of the Roman government yet there were many who still asserted their native freedom and who refused more especially in the mountains of Gallicia to submit to the Barbarian yoke  Mariana de Rebus Hispanicis l v c tom i p Hag Comit He had read in Orosius l vii c p that the Barbarians had turned their swords into ploughshares and that many of the Provincials preferred inter Barbaros pauperem libertatem quam inter Romanos tributariam solicitudinem sustinere  "  The important present of the heads of Jovinus and Sebastian had approved the friendship of  Adolphus king of the Goths marches into Spain A D  Adolphus and restored Gaul to the obedience of his brother Honorius Peace was incompatible with the situation and temper of the king of the Goths He readily accepted the proposal of turning his victorious arms against the Barbarians of  Spain the troops of Constantius intercepted his communication with the seaports of Gaul and gently pressed his march towards the Pyrenees  This mixture of force and persuasion may be fairly inferred from comparing Orosius and Jornandes the Roman and the Gothic historian  he passed the mountains and surprised in the name of the emperor the city of Barcelona The fondness of Adolphus for his Roman bride was not abated by time or possession and the birth of a son surnamed from his illustrious grandsire Theodosius appeared to fix him for ever in the interest of the republic The loss of that infant whose remains were deposited in a silver coffin in one of the churches near Barcelona afflicted his parents but the grief of the Gothic king was suspended by the labours of the field and the course of his victories was soon interrupted by domestic treason He had imprudently received into his service one of the followers of Sarus a Barbarian of a daring spirit but of a diminutive stature whose secret desire of revenging the death of his beloved patron was continually irritated by the sarcasms of his insolent  His death A D August  master Adolphus was assassinated in the palace of Barcelona the laws of the succession were violated by a tumultuous faction  According to the system of Jornandes c p the true hereditary right to the Gothic sceptre was vested in the  Amali  but those princes who were the vassals of the Huns commanded the tribes of the Ostrogoths in some distant parts of Germany or Seythia  and a stranger to the royal race Singeric the brother of Sarus himself was seated on the Gothic throne The  first act of his reign was the inhuman murder of the six children of Adolphus the issue of a former marriage whom he tore without pity from the feeble arms of a venerable bishop  The murder is related by Olympiodorus but the number of the children is taken from an epitaph of suspected authority  The unfortunate Placidia instead of the respectful compassion which she might have excited in the most savage breasts was treated with cruel and wanton insult The daughter of the emperor Theodosius confounded among a crowd of vulgar captives was compelled to march on foot above twelve miles before the horse of a Barbarian the assassin of an husband whom Placidia loved and lamented  The death of Adolphus was celebrated at Constantinople with illuminations and Circensian games See Chron Alexandrin It may seem doubtful whether the Greeks were actuated on this occasion by their hatred of the Barbarians or of the Latins    But Placidia soon obtained the pleasure of revenge  The Goths conquer and resotre Spain A D  and the view of her ignominious sufferings might rouse an indignant people against the tyrant who was assassinated on the seventh day of his usurpation After the death of Singeric the free choice of the nation bestowed the Gothic sceptre on Wallia whose warlike and ambitious temper appeared in the beginning of his reign extremely hostile to the republic He marched in arms from Barcelona to the shores of the Atlantic Ocean which the ancients revered and dreaded as the boundary of the world But when he reached the Southern promontory of  Spain  Quòd  Tartessiacis  avus hujus Vallia  terris  Vandalicas turmas et juncti Martis Alanos  Stravit et occiduam texêre cadavera  Calpen  Sidon Apollinar in Panegyr Anthem p edit Sirmond  and from the rock now covered by the fortress of Gibraltar contemplated the neighbouring and fertile coast of Africa Wallia resumed the designs of conquest which had been interrupted by the death of Alaric The winds and waves again disappointed the enterprise of the Goths and the minds of a superstitious people were deeply affected by the repeated disasters of storms and shipwrecks In this disposition the successor of Adolphus no longer refused to listen to a Roman ambassador whose proposals were enforced by the real or supposed approach of a numerous army under the conduct of the brave Constantius A solemn treaty was stipulated and observed Placidia was honourably restored to her brother six hundred thousand measures of wheat were delivered to the hungry Goths  This supply was very acceptable the Goths were insulted by the Vandals of Spain with the epithet of  Truli  because in their extreme distress they had given a piece of gold for a  trula  or about half a pound of flour Olympiod apud Phot p  and Wallia engaged to draw his sword in the service of the empire A bloody war was instantly excited among the Barbarians of Spain and the contending princes are said to have addressed their letters their ambassadors and their hostages to the throne of the Western emperor exhorting him to remain a tranquil spectator of their contest the events of which must be favourable to the Romans by the mutual slaughter of  their common enemies  Orosius inserts a copy of these pretended letters Tu cum omnibus pacem habe omniumque obsides accipe nos nobis confligimus nobis perimus tibi vincimus immortalis vero quaestus erat Reipublicae tuae si utrique pereamus The idea is just but I cannot persuade myself that it was entertained or expressed by the Barbarians  The Spanish war was obstinately supported during three campaigns with desperate valour and various success and the martial atchievements of Wallia diffused through the empire the superior renown of the Gothic hero He exterminated the Silingi who had irretrievably ruined the elegant plenty of the province of Boetica He slew in battle the king of the Alani and the remains of those Scythian wanderers who escaped from the field instead of chusing a new leader humbly sought a refuge under the standard of the Vandals with whom they were ever afterwards confounded The Vandals themselves and the Suevi yielded to the efforts of the invincible Goths The promiscuous multitude of Barbarians whose retreat had been intercepted were driven into the mountains of Gallicia where they still continued in a narrow compass and on a barren soil to exercise their domestic and implacable hostilities In the pride of victory Wallia was faithful to his engagements he restored his Spanish conquests to the obedience of Honorius and the tyranny of the Imperial officers soon reduced an oppressed people to regret the time of their Barbarian servitude While the event of the war was still doubtful the first advantages obtained by the  arms of Wallia had encouraged the court of Ravenna to decree the honours of a triumph to their feeble sovereign He entered Rome like the ancient conquerors of nations and if the monuments of servile corruption had not long since met with the fate which they deserved we should probably find that a crowd of poets and orators of magistrates and bishops applauded the fortune the wisdom and the invincible courage of the emperor Honorius  Romam triumphans ingreditur is the formal expression of Prosper's Chronicle The facts which relate to the death of Adolphus and the exploits of Wallia are related from Olympiodorus apud Phot p Orosius l vii c p Jornandes de Rebus Geticis c and the Chronicles of Idatius and Isidore    Such a triumph might have been justly claimed  Their establishment in Aquitain A D  by the ally of Rome if Wallia before he repassed the Pyrenees had extirpated the seeds of the Spanish war His victorious Goths fortythree years after they had passed the Danube were established according to the faith of treaties in the possession of the second Aquitain a maritime province between the Garonne and the Loire under the civil and ecclesiastical jurisdiction of Bourdeaux That metropolis advantageously situated for the trade of the ocean was built in a regular and elegant form and its numerous inhabitants were distinguished among the Gauls by their wealth their learning and the politeness of their manners The adjacent province which has been fondly compared to the garden of Eden is blessed with a fruitful soil and a temperate  climate the face of the country displayed the arts and the rewards of industry and the Goths after their martial toils luxuriously exhausted the rich vineyards of Aquitain  Ausonius de Claris Urbibus p celebrates Bourdeaux with the partial affection of a native See in Salvian de Gubern Dei p Paris a florid description of the provinces of Aquitain and Novempopulania  The Gothic limits were enlarged by the additional gift of some neighbouring dioceses and the successors of Alaric fixed their royal residence at Thoulouse which included five populous quarters or cities within the spacious circuit of its walls About the same time in the last years of the reign of Honorius the GOTHS the BURGUNDIANS and  The Burgundians  the FRANKS obtained a permanent seat and dominion in the provinces of Gaul The liberal grant of the usurper Jovinus to his Burgundian allies was confirmed by the lawful emperor the lands of the First or Upper Germany were ceded to those formidable Barbarians and they gradually occupied either by conquest or treaty the two provinces which still retain with the titles of  Duchy  and of  County  the national appellation of Burgundy  Orosius l vii c p commends the mildness and modesty of these Burgundians who treated their subjects of Gaul as their Christian brethren Mascou has illustrated the origin of their kingdom in the four first annotations at the end of his laboricus History of the Ancient Germans vol ii p of the English translation  The Franks the valiant and faithful allies of the Roman republic were soon tempted to imitate the invaders whom they had so bravely resisted Treves the capital of  Gaul was pillaged by their lawless bands and the humble colony which they so long maintained in the district of Toxandria in Brabant insensibly multiplied along the banks of the Meuse and Scheld till their independent power filled the whole extent of the Second or Lower Germany These facts may be sufficiently justified by historic evidence but the foundation of the French monarchy by Pharamond the conquests the laws and even the existence of that hero have been justly arraigned by the impartial severity of modern criticism  See Mascou l viii c Except in a short and suspicious line of the Chronicie of Prosper in tom i p the name of Pharamond is never mentioned before the seventh century The author of the Gesta Francorum in tom ii p suggests probably enough that the choice of Pharamond or at least of a king was recommended to the Franks by his father Marcomir who was an exile in Tuscany    The ruin of the opulent provinces of Gaul  State of the Barbarians in Gaul A D c  may be dated from the establishment of these Barbarians whose alliance was dangerous and oppressive and who were capriciously impelled by interest or passion to violate the public peace A heavy and partial ransom was imposed on the surviving provincials who had escaped the calamities of war the fairest and most fertile lands were assigned to the rapacious strangers for the use of their families their slaves and their cattle and the trembling natives relinquished with a sigh the inheritance of their fathers Yet these domestic misfortunes which are seldom the lot of a vanquished people had been felt and inflicted  by the Romans themselves not only in the insolence of foreign conquest but in the madness of civil discord The Triumvirs proscribed eighteen of the most flourishing colonies of Italy and distributed their lands and houses to the veterans who revenged the death of Caesar and oppressed the liberty of their country Two poets of unequal fame have deplored in similar circumstances the loss of their patrimony but the legionaries of Augustus appear to have surpassed in violence and injustice the Barbarians who invaded Gaul under the reign of Honorius It was not without the utmost difficulty that Virgil escaped from the sword of the Centurion who had usurped his farm in the neighbourhood of

the useful Commentary of Servius Fifteen miles of the Mantuan territory were assigned to the veterans with a reservation in favour of the inhabitants of three miles round the city Even in this favour they were cheated by Alfenus Varus a famous lawyer and one of the commissioners who measured eight hundred paces of water and morass  but Paulinus of Bourdeaux received a sum of money from his Gothic purchaser which he accepted with pleasure and surprise and though it was much inferior to the real value of his estate this act of rapine was disguised by some colours of moderation and equity  See the remarkable passage of the Eucharisticon of Paulinus apud Moscou l viii c  The odious name of conquerors was softened into the mild and friendly appellation of the  guests  of the Romans and the Barbarians of Gaul more especially the Goths repeatedly declared that they were bound to the people by the ties of hospitality and to the emperor by the duty of allegiance and military service The title of Honorius and his successors their laws and their civil magistrates were still respected in the provinces of Gaul of which they had resigned the possession to the Barbarian allies and the kings who exercised a supreme and independent authority over their native subjects ambitiously solicited the more honourable rank of mastergenerals of the Imperial armies  This important truth is established by the accuracy of Tillemont Hist des Emp tom v p and by the ingenuity of the Abbé Dubos Hist de l'Etablissement de la Monarchie Francoise dans les Gaules tom i p  Such was the involuntary reverence which the Roman name still impressed on the minds of those warriors who had borne away in triumph the spoils of the Capitol  Whilst Italy was ravaged by the Goths and  Revolt of Britain and Armorica A D  a succession of feeble tyrants oppressed the provinces beyond the Alps the British island separated itself from the body of the Roman empire The regular forces which guarded that remote province had been gradually withdrawn and Britain was abandoned without defence to the Saxon pirates and the savages of Ireland and Caledonia The Britons reduced to this extremity no longer relied on the tardy and doubtful aid of a declining monarchy They assembled in arms repelled the invaders and rejoiced in the  important discovery of their own strength  Zosimus l vi p relates in a few words the revolt of Britain and Armorica Our antiquarians even the great Cambden himself have been betrayed into many gross errors by their imperfect knowledge of the history of the continent  Afflicted by similar calamities and actuated by the same spirit the Armorican provinces a name which comprehended the maritime countries of Gaul between the Seine and the Loire  The limits of Armorica are defined by two national geographers Messieurs de Valois and d'Anville in their  Notitias  of Ancient Gaul The word had been used in a more extensive and was afterwards contracted to a much narrower signification  resolved to imitate the example of the neighbouring island They expelled the Roman magistrates who acted under the authority of the usurper Constantine and a free government was established among a people who had so long been subject to the arbitrary will of a master The independence of Britain and Armorica was soon confirmed by Honorius himself the lawful emperor of the West and the letters by which he committed to the new states the care of their own safety might be interpreted as an absolute and perpetual abdication of the exercise and rights of sovereignty This interpretation was in some measure justified by the event After the usurpers of Gaul had successively fallen the maritime provinces were restored to the empire Yet their obedience was imperfect and precarious the vain inconstant rebellious disposition of the people was incompatible either with freedom  or servitude  Gens inter geminos notissima clauditur amnes  Armoricana prius veteri cognomine

departure and the arrival of the Saxons  But as the emperors wisely acquiesced in the independence of a remote province the separation was not embittered by the reproach of tyranny or rebellion and

sometimes forced me to deviate from the  conditional  into the  indicative  mood  I Zosimus who alone has preserved the memory of this singular transaction very accurately observes that the letters of Honorius were addressed to the  cities  of Britain  Zosimus l vi p  Under the protection of the Romans ninetytwo considerable towns had arisen in the several parts of that great province and among these thirtythree cities were distinguished above the rest by their superior privileges and importance  Two cities of Britain were  municipia  nine  colonies  ten  Lat  jure donatae  twelve  stipendiariae  of eminent note This detail is taken from Richard of Cirencester de Sitû Britanniae p and though it may not seem probable that he wrote from the MSS of a Roman general he shews a genuine knowledge of antiquity very extraordinary for a monk of the fourteenth century  Each of these cities as in all the other provinces of the empire formed a legal corporation for the purpose of regulating their domestic policy and the powers of municipal government were distributed among annual magistrates a select senate and the assembly of the people according to the original model of the Roman constitution  See Maffei Verona Illustrata part i l v p  The management of a common revenue the exercise of civil and criminal jurisdiction and the habits of public counsel and command were inherent to these petty republics and when they asserted  their independence the youth of the city and of the adjacent districts would naturally range themselves under the standard of the magistrate But the desire of obtaining the advantages and of escaping the burthens of political society is a perpetual and inexhaustible source of discord nor can it reasonably be presumed that the restoration of British freedom was exempt from tumult and faction The preeminence of birth and fortune must have been frequently violated by bold and popular citizens and the haughty nobles who complained that they were become the subjects of their own servants  Leges restituit libertatemque reducit  Et servos famulis non sinit esse suis  Itinerar Rutil l i  would sometimes regret the reign of an arbitrary monarch  II The jurisdiction of each city over the adjacent country was supported by the patrimonial influence of the principal senators and the smaller towns the villages and the proprietors of land consulted their own safety by adhering to the shelter of these rising republics The sphere of their attraction was proportioned to the respective degrees of their wealth and populousness but the hereditary lords of ample possessions who were not oppressed by the neighbourhood of any powerful city aspired to the rank of independent princes and boldly exercised the rights of peace and war The gardens and villas which exhibited some faint imitation of Italian elegance would soon be converted into  strong castles the refuge in time of danger of the adjacent country  An inscription apud

produce of the land was applied to purchase arms and horses to maintain a military force of slaves of peasants and of licentious followers and the chieftain might assume within his own domain the powers of a civil magistrate Several of these British chiefs might be the genuine posterity of ancient kings and many more would be tempted to adopt this honourable genealogy and to vindicate their hereditary claims which had been suspended by the usurpation of the Caesars  The establishment of their power would have been easy indeed if we could adopt the impracticable scheme of a lively and learned antiquarian who supposes that the British monarchs of the several tribes continued to reign though with subordinate jurisdiction from the time of Claudius to that of Honorius See Whitaker's History of Manchester vol i p  Their situation and their hopes would dispose them to affect the dress the language and the customs of their ancestors If the  princes  of Britain relapsed into barbarism while the  cities  studiously preserved the laws and manners of Rome the whole island must have been gradually divided by the distinction of two national parties again broken into a thousand subdivisions of war and faction by the various provocations of interest and resentment The public strength instead of being united against a foreign enemy was consumed in obscure and intestine quarrels  and the personal merit which had placed a successful leader at the head of his equals might enable him to subdue the freedom of some neighbouring cities and to claim a rank among the

salutary lessons might be frequently inculcated in their popular discourses and the episcopal synods were the only councils that could pretend to the weight and authority of a national assembly In such councils where the princes and magistrates sat promiscuously with the bishops the important affairs of the state as well as of the church might be freely debated differences reconciled alliances formed contributions imposed wise resolutions often concerted and sometimes  executed and there is reason to believe that in moments of extreme danger a  Pendragon  or Dictator was elected by the general consent of the Britons These pastoral cares so worthy of the episcopal character were interrupted however by zeal and superstition and the British clergy incessantly laboured to eradicate the

convening an annual assembly of the  seven provinces  a name peculiarly appropriated to Aquitain and the ancient Narbonnese which had long since exchanged their Celtic rudeness for the useful and elegant arts of Italy  It is evident from the  Notitia  that the seven provinces were the Viennensis the maritime Alps the first and second Narbonnese Novempopulania and the first and second Aquitain In the room of the first Aquitain the Abbé Dubos on the authority of Hincmar desires to introduce the first Lugdunensis or Lyonnese  Arles the seat of government and commerce was appointed for the place of the assembly which regularly  continued twentyeight days from the fifteenth of August to the thirteenth of September of every year It consisted of the Praetorian praefect of the Gauls of seven provincial governors one consular and six presidents of the magistrates and perhaps the bishops of about sixty cities and of a competent though indefinite number of the most honourable and opulent  possessors  of land who might justly be considered as the representatives of their country They were impowered to interpret and communicate the laws of their sovereign to expose the grievances and wishes of their constituents to moderate the excessive or unequal weight of taxes and to deliberate on every subject of local or national importance that could tend to the restoration of the peace and prosperity of the seven provinces If such an institution which gave the people an interest in their own government had been universally established by Trajan or the Antonines the seeds of public wisdom and virtue might have been cherished and propagated in the empire of Rome The privileges of the subject would have secured the throne of the monarch the abuses of an arbitrary administration might have been prevented in some degree or corrected by the interposition of these representative assemblies and the country would have been defended against a foreign enemy by the arms of natives and freemen Under the mild and generous influence of liberty the Roman empire might have remained invincible and immortal or if its excessive magnitude and the instability  of human affairs had opposed such perpetual continuance its vital and constituent members might have separately preserved their vigour and independence But in the decline of the empire when every principle of health and life had been exhausted the tardy application of this partial remedy was incapable of producing any important or salutary effects The emperor Honorius expresses his surprise that he must compel the reluctant provinces to accept a privilege which they should ardently have solicited A fine of three or even five pounds of gold was imposed on the absent representatives who seem to have declined this imaginary gift of a free constitution as the last and most cruel insult of their oppressors  CHAP XXXII  Arcadius Emperor of the EastAdministration and Disgrace of EutropiusRevolt of

condemn the pompous luxury of the reign of Arcadius  "The emperor" says he "wears on his head either a diadem or a crown of gold decorated with precious stones of inestimable value These ornaments and his purple garments are reserved for his sacred person alone and his robes of silk are embroidered with the figures of golden dragons His throne is of massy gold Whenever he appears in public he is

arms his horses and his guards beside him and his vanquished enemies in chains at his feet"  The successors of Constantine established their perpetual residence in the royal city which he  had erected on the verge of Europe and Asia Inaccessible to the menaces of their enemies and perhaps to the complaints of their people they received with each wind the tributary productions of every climate while the impregnable strength of their capital continued for ages to defy the hostile attempts of the Barbarians Their dominions were bounded by the Hadriatic and the Tigris and the whole interval of

of that empire were the seat of art and learning of luxury and wealth and the inhabitants who had assumed the language and manners of Greeks stiled themselves with some appearance of truth the most enlightened and civilised portion of the human species The form of government was a pure and simple monarchy the name of the ROMAN REPUBLIC which so long preserved a faint tradition of freedom was confined to the Latin provinces and the princes of Constantinople measured their greatness by the servile obedience of their people They were ignorant  how much this passive disposition enervates and degrades every faculty of the mind The subjects who had resigned their will to the absolute commands of a master were equally incapable of guarding their lives and fortunes against the assaults of the Barbarians or of defending their reason from the terrors of superstition  The first events of the reign of Arcadius and  Administration and character of Eutropius A D  Honorius are so intimately connected that the rebellion of the Goths and the fall of Rufinus have already claimed a place in the history of the West It has already been observed that Eutropius  Barthius who adored his author with the blind superstition of a commentator gives the preference to the two books which Claudian composed against Eutropius above all his other productions Baillet Jugemens des Savans tom iv p They are indeed a very elegant and spirited satire and would be more valuable in an historical light if the invective were less vague and more temperate  one of the principal eunuchs of the palace of Constantinople succeeded the haughty minister whose ruin he had accomplished and whose vices he soon imitated Every order of the state bowed to the new favourite and their tame and obsequious submission encouraged him to insult the laws and what is still more difficult and dangerous the manners of his country Under the weakest of the predecessors of Arcadius the reign of the eunuchs had been secret and almost invisible They insinuated themselves into the confidence of the prince but their ostensible functions were confined to the menial service of the wardrobe and Imperial bedchamber They might direct in a whisper the public counsels and blast by their malicious suggestions  the fame snd fortunes of the most illustrious citizens but they never presumed to stand forward in the front of empire  After lamenting the progress of the eunuchs in the Roman palace and defining their proper functions Claudian adds  A fronte recedant  Imperii  In Eutrop i  Yet it does not appear that the eunuch had assumed any of the officient offices of the empire and he is stiled only Praepositus sacri+cubiculi in the edict of his banishment See Cod Theod l ix tit xl leg  or to profane the public honours of the state Eutropius was the first of his artificial sex who dared to assume the character of a Roman magistrate and general  Jamque oblita sui nec sobria divitiis mens  In miseras leges hominumque negotia ludit  Judicat cunuchus  Arma etiam violare parat  Claudian i with that mixture of indignation and humour which always pleases in a satiric poet describes the insolent folly of the eunuch the disgrace of the empire and the joy of the Goths  Gaudet cum viderit hostis  Et sentit jam deesse viros  Sometimes in the presence of the blushing senate he ascended the tribunal to pronounce judgment or to repeat elaborate harangues and sometimes appeared on horseback at the head of his troops in the dress and armour of a hero The disregard of custom and decency always betrays a weak and illregulated mind nor does Eutropius seem to have compensated for the folly of the design by any superior merit or ability in the execution His former habits of life had not introduced him to the study of the laws or the exercises of the field his awkward and unsuccessful  attempts provoked the secret contempt of the spectators the Goths expressed their wish that  such  a general might always command the armies of Rome and the name of the minister was branded with ridicule more pernicious perhaps than hatred to a public character The subjects of Arcadius were exasperated by the recollection that this deformed and decrepid eunuch  The poet's lively description of his deformity i is confirmed by the authentic testimony of Chrysostom tom iii p edit Montfaucon who observes that when the paint was washed away the face of Eutropius appeared more ugly and wrinkled than that of an old woman Claudian remarks i and the remark must have been founded on experience that there was scarcely any interval between the youth and the decrepid age of an eunuch  who so perversely mimicked the actions of a man was born in the most abject condition of servitude that before he entered the Imperial palace he had been successively sold and purchased by an hundred masters who had exhausted his youthful strength in every mean and infamous office and at length dismissed him in his old age to freedom and poverty  Eutropius appears to have been a native of Armenia or Assyria His three services which Claudian more particularly describes were these He spent many years as the catamite of Ptolemy a groom or soldier of the Imperial stables Ptolemy gave him to the old general Arintheus for whom he very skilfully exercised the profession of a pimp He was given on her marriage to the daughter of Arintheus and the future consul was employed to comb her hair to present the silver ewer to wash and to fan his mistress in hot weather See l i  While these disgraceful stories were circulated and perhaps exaggerated in private conversations the vanity of the favourite was flattered with the most extraordinary honours In the senate in  the capital in the provinces the statues of Eutropius were erected in brass or marble decorated with the symbols of his civil and military virtues and inscribed with the pompous title of the third founder of Constantinople He was promoted to the rank of  patrician  which began to signify in a popular and even legal acceptation the father of the emperor and the last year of the fourth century was polluted by the  consulship  of an eunuch and a slave This strange and inexpiable prodigy  Claudian l i in Eutrop after enumerating the various prodigies of monstrous births speaking animals showers of blood or stones double suns c adds with some exaggeration  Omnia cesserunt eunucho consule monstra  The first book concludes with a noble speech of the goddess of Rome to her favourite Honorius deprecating the  new  ignominy to which she was exposed  awakened however the prejudices of the Romans The effeminate consul was rejected by the West as an indelible stain to the annals of the republic and without invoking the shades of Brutus and Camillus the colleague of Eutropius a learned and respectable magistrate  Fl Mallius Theodorus whose civil honours and philosophical works have been celebrated by Claudian in a very elegant panegyric  sufficiently represented the different maxims of the two administrations  The bold and vigorous mind of Rufinus seems  His venality and injustice  to have been actuated by a more sanguinary and revengeful spirit but the avarice of the eunuch was not less insatiate than that of the praefect  drunk with riches is the forcible expression of Zosimus l v p and the avarice of Eutropius is equally execrated in the Lexicon of Suidas and the Chronicle of Marcellinus Chrysostom had often admonished the favourite of the vanity and danger of immoderate wealth tom iii p    As long as he despoiled the oppressors who had enriched themselves with the plunder of the people Eutropius might gratify his covetous disposition without much envy or injustice but the progress of his rapine soon invaded the wealth which had been acquired by lawful inheritance or laudable industry The usual methods of extortion were practised and improved and Claudian has sketched a lively and original picture of the public auction of the state  "The impotence of the eunuch" says that agreeable satirist "has served only to stimulate his avarice the same hand which in his servile condition was exercised in petty thefts to unlock the coffers of his master now grasps the riches of the world and this infamous broker of the empire appreciates and divides the Roman provinces from Mount Haemus to the Tigris One man at the expence of his villa is made proconsul of Asia a second purchases Syria with his wife's jewels and a third laments that he has exchanged his paternal estate for the government of Bithynia In the antichamber of Eutropius a large tablet is exposed to public view which marks the respective prices of the provinces The different value of Pontus of Galatia of Lydia is accurately distinguished Lycia may be obtained for so many thousand pieces of gold but the opulence of Phrygia will require a more considerable sum The eunuch wishes to obliterate by the general disgrace his personal ignominy and as he has  been sold himself he is desirous of selling the rest of mankind In the eager contention the balance which contains the fate and fortunes of the province often trembles on the beam and till one of the scales is inclined by a superior weight the mind of the impartial judge remains in anxious suspense  certantum saepe duorum  Diversum suspendit onus cum pondere Judex  Vergit et in geminas nutat provincia lances  Claudian i so curiously distinguishes the circumstances of the sale that they all seem to allude to particular anecdotes  "  Such" continues the indignant poet  "are the fruits of Roman valour of the defeat of Antiochus and of the triumph of Pompey"  This venal prostitution of public honours secured the impunity of  future  crimes but the riches which Eutropius derived from confiscation were  already  stained with injustice since it was decent to accuse and to condemn the proprietors of the wealth which he was impatient to confiscate Some noble blood was shed by the hand of the executioner and the most inhospitable extremities of the empire were filled with innocent and illustrious exiles Among the generals and consuls  Ruin of Abundantius  of the East Abundantius  Claudian i mentions the  guilt  and exile of Abundantius nor could he fail to quote the example of the artist who made the first trial of the brazen bull which he presented to Phalaris See Zosimus l v p Jerom tom i p The difference of place is easily reconciled but the decisive authority of Asterius of Amasia Orat iv p apud Tillemont Hist des Empereurs tom v p must turn the scale in favour of Pityus  had reason to dread the first effects of the resentment of Eutropius He had been guilty of the unpardonable  crime of introducing that abject slave to the palace of Constantinople and some degree of praise must be allowed to a powerful and ungrateful favourite who was satisfied with the disgrace of his benefactor Abundantius was stripped of his ample fortunes by an Imperial rescript and banished to Pityus on the Euxine the last frontier of the Roman world where he subsisted by the precarious mercy of the Barbarians till he could obtain after the fall of Eutropius a milder exile at Sidon in Phoenicia The destruction of Timasius  Suidas most probably from the history of Eunapius has given a very unfavourable picture of Timasius The account of his accuser the judges trial c is perfectly agreeable to the practice of ancient and modern courts See Zosimus l v p I am almost tempted to quote the romance of a great master Fielding's Works vol iv p c vo edit which may be considered as the history of human nature  of Timasius  required a more serious and regular mode of attack That great officer the mastergeneral of the armies of Theodosius had signalised his valour by a decisive victory which he obtained over the Goths of Thessaly but he was too prone after the example of his sovereign to enjoy the luxury of peace and to abandon his confidence to wicked and designing flatterers Timasius had despised the public clamour by promoting an infamous dependent to the command of a cohort and he deserved to feel the ingratitude of Bargus who was secretly instigated by the favourite to accuse his patron of a treasonable conspiracy The general was arraigned before the tribunal of Arcadius himself and the principal eunuch stood by the side of the throne  to suggest the questions and answers of his sovereign But as this form of trial might be deemed partial and arbitrary the farther enquiry into the crimes of Timasius was delegated to Saturninus and Procopius the former of consular rank the latter still respected as the fatherinlaw of the emperor Valens The appearances of a fair and legal proceeding were maintained by the blunt honesty of Procopius and he yielded with reluctance to the obsequious dexterity of his colleague who pronounced a sentence of condemnation against the unfortunate Timasius His immense riches were confiscated in the name of the emperor and for the benefit of the favourite and he was doomed to perpetual exile at Oasis a solitary spot in the midst of the sandy deserts of Libya  The great Oasis was one of the spots in the sands of Libya watered with springs and capable of producing wheat barley and palmtrees It was about three days journey from north to south about half a day in breadth and at the distance of about five days march to the west of Abydus on the Nile See d'Anville Description de l'Egypte p The barren desert which encompasses Oasis Zosimus l v p has suggested the idea of comparative fertility and even the epithet of the  happy island  Herodot iii  Secluded from all human converse the mastergeneral of the Roman armies was lost for ever to the world but the circumstances of his fate have been related in a various and contradictory manner It is insinuated that Eutropius dispatched a private order for his secret execution  The line of Claudian in Eutrop l i  Marmaricus claris violatur caedibus Hammon evidently alludes to  his  persuasion of the death of Timasius  It was reported that in attempting to escape from Oasis he perished in the desert  of thirst and hunger and that his dead body was found on the sands of Libya  Sozomen l viii c He speaks from report    It has been asserted with more confidence that his son Syagrius after successfully eluding the pursuit of the agents and emissaries of the court collected a band of African robbers that he rescued Timasius from the place of his exile and that both the father and the son disappeared from the knowledge of mankind  Zosimus l v p Yet he seems to suspect that this rumour was spread by the friends of Eutropius  But the ungrateful Bargus instead of being suffered to possess the reward of guilt was soon afterwards circumvented and destroyed by the more powerful villany of the minister himself who retained sense and spirit enough to abhor the instrument of his own crimes  The public hatred and the despair of individuals  A cruel and unjust law of treason A D Sept  continually threatened or seemed to threaten the personal safety of Eutropius as well as of the numerous adherents who were attached to his fortune and had been promoted by his venal favour For their mutual defence he contrived the safeguard of a law which violated every principle of humanity and justice  See the Theodosian Code l ix tit ad legem Corneliam de Sicariis leg and the Code of Justinian l ix tit viii ad legem Juliam de Majestate leg The alteration of the  title  from murder to treason was an improvement of the subtle Tribonian Godefroy in a formal dissertation which he has inserted in his Commentary illustrates this law of Arcadius and explains all the difficult passages which had been perverted by the jurisconsults of the darker ages See tom iii p    I It is enacted in the name and by the authority of Arcadius that all those who shall conspire either with subjects or with strangers against the lives of any of the persons whom the emperor considers as the members of his own body shall be punished with death and confiscation This species of fictitious and metaphorical treason is extended to protect not only the  illustrious  officers of the state and army who are admitted into the sacred consistory but likewise the principal domestics of the palace the senators of Constantinople the military commanders and the civil magistrates of the provinces a vague and indefinite list which under the successors of Constantine included an obscure and numerous train of subordinate ministers II This extreme severity might perhaps be justified had it been only directed to secure the representatives of the sovereign from any actual violence in the execution of their office But the whole body of Imperial dependents claimed a privilege or rather impunity which screened them in the loosest moments of their lives from the hasty perhaps the justifiable resentment of their fellowcitizens and by a strange perversion of the laws the same degree of guilt and punishment was applied to a private quarrel and to a deliberate conspiracy against the emperor and the empire The edict of Arcadius most positively and most absurdly declares that in such cases of treason  thoughts  and  actions  ought to be punished with equal severity that the knowledge of a mischievous intention unless it be instantly revealed  becomes equally criminal with the intention itself  Bartolus understands a simple and naked consciousness without any sign of approbation or concurrence For this opinion says Baldus he is now roasting in hell For my own part continues the discreet Heineccius Element Jur Civil l iv p I must approve the theory of Bartolus but in practice I should incline to the sentiment of Baldus Yet Bartolus was gravely quoted by the lawyers of Cardinal Richelieu and Eutropius was indirectly guilty of the murder of the virtuous de Thou  and that those rash men who shall presume to solicit the pardon of traitors shall themselves be branded with public and perpetual infamy III  "With regard to the sons of the traitors" continues the emperor "although they ought to share the punishment since they will probably imitate the guilt of their parents yet by the special effect of our Imperial lenity we grant them their lives but at the same time we declare them incapable of inheriting either on the father's or on the mother's side or of receiving any gift or legacy from the testament either of kinsmen or of strangers Stigmatised with hereditary infamy excluded from the hopes of honours or fortune let them endure the pangs of poverty and contempt till they shall consider life as a calamity and death as a comfort and relief"  In such words so well adapted to insult the feelings of mankind did the emperor or rather his favourite eunuch applaud the moderation of a law which transferred the same unjust and inhuman penalties to the children of all those who had seconded or who had not disclosed these fictitious conspiracies Some of the noblest regulations  of Roman jurisprudence have been suffered to expire but this edict a convenient and forcible engine of ministerial tyranny was carefully inserted in the Codes of Theodosius and Justinian and the same maxims have been revived in modern ages to protect the electors of Germany and the cardinals of the church of Rome  Godefroy tom iii p It is however suspected that this law so repugnant to the maxims of Germanic freedom has been surreptitiously added to the golden bull    Yet these sanguinary laws which spread terror  Rebellion of Tribigild A D  among a disarmed and dispirited people were of too weak a texture to restrain the bold enterprise of Tribigild  A copious and

second book of Claudian against Eutropius is a sine though imperfect piece of history  the Ostrogoth The colony of that warlike nation which had been planted by Theodosius in one of the most fertile

colonies of the Bithynians of Thrace of the Greeks and at last of the Gauls His description ii of the fertility of Phrygia and of the four rivers that produce gold is just and picturesque  impatiently

shores of the Hellespont and a considerable part of Asia Minor was desolated by the rebellion of Tribigild His rapid progress was checked by the resistance of the peasants of Pamphylia and the Ostrogoths attacked in a narrow pass between the city of Selgae  Selgae a colony of the Lacedaemonians had formerly numbered twenty thousand citizens but in the age of Zosimus it was reduced to a  or small town See Cellarius Geograph Antiq tom ii p  a deep morass and the craggy clifts of Mount Taurus were defeated with the loss of their bravest troops But the spirit of their chief was not daunted by misfortune and his army was continually recruited by swarms of Barbarians and outlaws who were desirous of exercising the profession of robbery under the more honourable names of war and conquest The rumours of the success of Tribigild might for some time be suppressed by fear or disguised by flattery  yet they gradually alarmed both the court and the capital Every misfortune was exaggerated in dark and doubtful hints and the future designs of the rebels became the subject of anxious conjecture Whenever Tribigild advanced into the inland country the Romans were inclined to suppose that he meditated the passage of Mount Taurus and the invasion of Syria If he descended towards the sea they imputed and perhaps suggested to the Gothic chief the more dangerous project of arming a fleet in the harbours of Ionia and of extending his depredations along the maritime coast from the mouth of the Nile to the port of Constantinople The approach of danger and the obstinacy of Tribigild who refused all terms of accommodation compelled Eutropius to summon a council of war  The council of Eutropius in Claudian may be compared to that of Domitian in the fourth satire of Juvenal The principal members of the former were juvenes protervi lascivique senes one of them had been a cook a second a woolcomber The language of their original profession exposes their assumed dignity and their trifling conversation about tragedies dancers c is made still more ridiculous by the importance of the debate  After claiming for himself the privilege of a veteran soldier the eunuch entrusted the guard of Thrace and the Hellespont to Gainas the Goth and the command of the Asiatic army to his favourite Leo two generals who differently but effectually promoted the cause of the rebels Leo  Claudian l ii has branded him with infamy and Zosimus in more temperate language confirms his reproaches L v p  who from the bulk of his body  and the dulness of his mind was surnamed the Ajax of the East had deserted his original trade of a woolcomber to exercise with much less skill and success the military profession and his uncertain operations were capriciously framed and executed with an ignorance of real difficulties and a timorous neglect of every favourable opportunity The rashness of the Ostrogoths had drawn them into a disadvantageous position between the rivers Melas and Eurymedon where they were almost besieged by the peasants of Pamphylia but the arrival of an Imperial army instead of completing their destruction afforded the means of safety and victory Tribigild surprised the unguarded camp of the Romans in the darkness of the night seduced the faith of the greater part of the Barbarian auxiliaries and dissipated without much effort the troops which had been corrupted by the relaxation of discipline and the luxury of the capital The discontent of Gainas who had so boldly contrived and executed the death of Rufinus was irritated by the fortune of his unworthy successor he accused his own dishonourable patience under the servile reign of an eunuch and the ambitious Goth was convicted at least in the public opinion of secretly fomenting the revolt of Tribigild with whom he was connected by a domestic as well as by a national alliance  The  conspiracy  of Gainas and Tribigild which is attested by the Greek historian had not reached the ears of Claudian who attributes the revolt of the Ostrogoths to his own  martial  spirit and the advice of his wife  When Gainas passed  the Hellespont to unite under his standard the remains of the Asiatic troops he skilfully adapted his motions to the wishes of the Ostrogoths abandoning by his retreat the country which they desired to invade or facilitating by his approach the desertion of the Barbarian auxiliaries To the Imperial court he repeatedly magnified the valour the genius the inexhaustible resources of Tribigild confessed his own inability to prosecute the war and extorted the permission of negotiating with his invincible adversary The conditions of peace were dictated by the haughty rebel and the peremptory demand of the head of Eutropius revealed the author and the design of this hostile conspiracy  The bold satirist who has indulged his discontent  Fall of Eutropius A D  by the partial and passionate censure of the Christian emperors violates the dignity rather than the truth of history by comparing the son of Theodosius to one of those harmless and simple animals who scarcely feel that they are the property of their shepherd Two passions however fear and conjugal affection awakened the languid soul of Arcadius he was terrified by the threats of a victorious Barbarian and he yielded to the tender eloquence of his wife Eudoxia who with a flood of artificial tears presenting her infant children to their father implored his justice for some real or imaginary insult which she imputed to the audacious eunuch  This anecdote which Philostorgius alone has preserved l xi c and Gothofred Dissertat p is curious and important since it connects the revolt of the Goths with the secret intrigues of the palace  The emperor's  hand was directed to sign the condemnation of Eutropius the magic spell which during four years had bound the prince and the people was instantly dissolved and the acclamations that so lately hailed the merit and fortune of the favourite were converted into the clamours of the soldiers and people who reproached his crimes and pressed his immediate execution In this hour of distress and despair his only refuge was in the sanctuary of the church whose privileges he had wisely or profanely attempted to circumscribe and the most eloquent of the saints John Chrysostom enjoyed the triumph of protecting a prostrate minister whose choice had raised him to the ecclesiastical throne of Constantinople The archbishop ascending the pulpit of the cathedral that he might be distinctly seen and heard by an innumerable crowd of either sex and of every age pronounced a seasonable and pathetic discourse on the forgiveness of injuries and the instability of human greatness The agonies of the pale and affrighted wretch who lay groveling under the table of the altar exhibited a solemn and instructive spectacle and the orator who was afterwards accused of insulting the misfortunes of Eutropius laboured to excite the contempt that he might assuage the fury of the people  See the Homily of Chrysostom tom iii p of which the exordium is particularly beautiful Socrates l vi c Sozomen l viii c Montfaucon in his Life of Chrysostom tom xiii p too hastily supposes that Tribigild was  actually  in Constantinople and that he commanded the soldiers who were ordered to seize Eutropius Even Claudian a Pagan poet Praefat ad l ii in Eutrop has mentioned the flight of the eunuch to the sanctuary  Suppliciterque pias humilis prostratus ad aras  Mitigat iratas voce tremente nurus  The powers of humanity  of superstition and of eloquence prevailed The empress Eudoxia was restrained by her own prejudices or by those of her subjects from violating the sanctuary of the church and Eutropius was tempted to capitulate by the milder arts of persuasion and by an oath that his life should be spared  Chrysostom in another homily tom iii p affects to declare that Eutropius would not have been taken had he not deserted the church Zosimus l v p on the contrary pretends that his enemies forced him  from the sanctuary Yet the promise is an evidence of some treaty and the strong assurance of Claudian Praefat ad l ii  Sed tamen exemplo non feriere tuo may be considered as an evidence of some promise  Careless of the dignity of their sovereign the new ministers of the palace immediately published an edict to declare that his late favourite had disgraced the names of consul and patrician to abolish his statues to confiscate his wealth and to inflict a perpetual exile in the island of Cyprus  Cod Theod l ix tit xl leg The date of that law Jan A D is erroneous and corrupt since the fall of Eutropius could not happen till the autumn of the same year See Tillemont Hist des Empereurs tom v p  A dispicable and decrepid eunuch could no longer alarm the fears of his enemies nor was he capable of enjoying what yet remained the comforts of peace of solitude and of a happy climate But their implacable revenge still envied him the last moments of a miserable life and Eutropius had no sooner  touched the shores of Cyprus than he was hastily recalled The vain hope of eluding by a change of place the obligation of an oath engaged the empress to transfer the scene of his trial and execution from Constantinople to the adjacent suburb of Chalcedon The consul Aurelian pronounced the sentence and the motives of that sentence expose the jurisprudence of a despotic government The crimes which Eutropius had committed against the people might have justified his death but he was found guilty of harnessing to his chariot the  sacred  animals who from their breed or colour were reserved for the use of the emperor alone  Zosimus l v p Philostorgius l xi c    While this domestic revolution was transacted  Conspiracy and fall of Gainas A D  Gainas  Zosimus l v p Socrates l vi c Sozomen l viii c and Theodoret l v c represent though with some various circumstances the conspiracy defeat and death of Gainas  openly revolted from his allegiance united his forces at Thyatira in Lydia with those of Tribigild and still maintained his superior ascendant over the rebellious leader of the Ostrogoths The confederate armies advanced without resistance to the Streights of the Hellespont and the Bosphorus and Arcadius was instructed to prevent the loss of his Asiatic dominions by resigning his authority and his person to the faith of the Barbarians The church of the holy martyr Euphemia situate on a lofty eminence near Chalcedon  is the expression of Zosimus himself l v p who inadvertently uses the fashionable language of the Christians Evagrius describes l ii c the situation architecture relics and miracles of that celebrated church in which the general council of Chalcedon was afterwards held  was chosen for the  place of the interview Gainas bowed with reverence at the feet of the emperor whilst he required the sacrifice of Aurelian and Saturninus two ministers of consular rank and their naked necks were exposed by the haughty rebel to the edge of the sword till he condescended to grant them a precarious and disgraceful respite The Goths according to the terms of the agreement were immediately transported from Asia into Europe and their victorious chief who accepted the title of mastergeneral of the Roman armies soon filled Constantinople with his troops and distributed among his dependents the honours and rewards of the empire In his early youth Gainas had passed the Danube as a suppliant and a fugitive his elevation had been the work of valour and fortune and his indiscreet or perfidious conduct was the cause of his rapid downfal Notwithstanding the vigorous opposition of the archbishop he importunately claimed for his Arian sectaries the possession of a peculiar church and the pride of the catholics was offended by the public toleration of heresy  The pious remonstrances of Chrysostom which do not appear in his own writings are strongly urged by Theodoret but his insinuation that they were successful is disproved by facts Tillemont Hist des Empercurs tom v has discovered that the emperor to satisfy the rapacious demands of Gainas was obliged to melt the plate of the church of the Apostles  Every quarter of Constantinople was filled with tumult and disorder and the Barbarians gazed with  such ardour on the rich shops of the jewellers and the tables of the bankers which were covered with gold and silver that it was judged prudent to remove those dangerous temptations from their sight They resented the injurious precaution and some alarming attempts were made during the night to attack and destroy with fire the Imperial palace  The ecclesiastical historians who sometimes guide and sometimes follow the public opinion most confidently assert that the palace of Constantinople was guarded by legions of angels  In this state of  July  mutual and suspicious hostility the guards and the people of Constantinople shut the gates and rose in arms to prevent or to punish the conspiracy of the Goths During the absence of Gainas his troops were surprised and oppressed seven thousand Barbarians perished in this bloody massacre In the fury of the pursuit the catholics uncovered the roof and continued to throw down flaming logs of wood till they overwhelmed their adversaries who had retreated to the church or conventicle of the Arians Gainas was either innocent of the design or too confident of his success he was astonished by the intelligence that the flower of his army had been ingloriously destroyed that he himself was declared a public enemy and that his countryman Fravitta a brave and loyal confederate had assumed the management of the war by sea and land The enterprises of the rebel against the cities of Thrace were encountered by a firm and wellordered defence his hungry soldiers were soon reduced to the grass that grew on the margin of  the fortifications and Gainas who vainly regretted the wealth and luxury of Asia embraced a desperate resolution of forcing the passage of the Hellespont He was destitute of vessels but the woods of the Ch  rsonesus afforded materials for rafts and his intrepid Barbarians did not refuse to trust themselves to the waves But Fravitta  Dec  attentively watched the progress of their undertaking As soon as they had gained the middle of the stream the Roman gallies  Zosimus l v p mentions these gallies by the name of  Liburnians  and observes that they were as swift without explaining the difference between them as the vessels with fifty oars but that they were far inferior in speed to the  triremes  which had been long disused Yet he reasonably concludes from the testimony of Polybius that gallies of a still larger size had been constructed in the Punic wars Since the establishment of the Roman empire over the Mediterranean the useless art of building large ships of war had probably been neglected and at length forgotten  impelled by the full force of oars of the current and of a favourable wind rushed forwards in compact order and with irresistible weight and the Hellespont was covered with the fragments of the Gothic shipwreck After the destruction of his hopes and the loss of many thousands of his bravest soldiers Gainas who could no longer aspire to govern or to subdue the Romans determined to resume the independence of a savage life A light and active body of Barbarian horse disengaged from their infantry and baggage might perform in eight or ten days a march of three hundred miles from the Hellespont to the Danube  Chishull Travels p proceeded from Gallipoli through Hadrianople to the Danube in about fifteen days He was in the train of an English ambassador whose baggage consisted of seventyone waggons That learned traveller has the merit of tracing a curious and unfrequented route  the garrisons of that important frontier  had been gradually annihilated the river in the month of December would be deeply frozen and the unbounded prospect of Scythia was open to the ambition of Gainas This design was secretly communicated to the national troops who devoted themselves to the fortunes of their leader and before the signal of departure was given a great number of provincial auxiliaries whom he suspected of an attachment to their native country were perfidiously massacred The Goths advanced by rapid marches through the plains of Thrace and they were soon delivered from the fear of a pursuit by the vanity of Fravitta who instead of extinguishing the war hastened to enjoy the popular applause and to assume the peaceful honours of the consulship But a formidable ally appeared in arms to vindicate the majesty of the empire and to guard the peace and liberty of Scythia  The narrative of Zosimus who actually leads Gainas beyond the Danube must be corrected by the testimony of Socrates and Sozomen that he was killed in  Thrace  and by the precise and authentic dates of the Alexandrian or Paschal Chronicle p The naval victory of the Hellespont is fixed to the month Apellaeus the tenth of the calends of January December the head of Gainas was brought to Constantinople the third of the nones of January January in the month Audynaeus  The superior forces of Uldin king of the Huns opposed the progress of Gainas an hostile and ruined country prohibited his retreat he disdained to capitulate and after repeatedly attempting to cut his way through the ranks of the  enemy he was slain with his desperate followers in the field of battle Eleven days after the naval victory of the Hellespont the head of Gainas  A D January  the inestimable gift of the conqueror was received at Constantinople with the most liberal expressions of gratitude and the public deliverance was celebrated by festivals and illuminations The triumphs of Arcadius became the subject of epic poems  Eusebius Scholasticus acquired much fame by his poem on

After the death of the indolent Nectarius the  Election and merit of Chrysostom A D Feb  successor of Gregory Nazianzen the church of Constantinople was distracted by the ambition of rival candidates who were not ashamed to solicit with gold or flattery the suffrage of the people or of the favourite On this occasion Eutropius seems to have deviated from his ordinary maxims and his uncorrupted judgment was determined only by the superior merit of a stranger In a late journey into the East he had admired the sermons of John a native and presbyter of Antioch whose name has been distinguished by the epithet of Chrysostom or the Golden Mouth  The sixth book of Socrates the eighth of Sozomen and the fifth of Theodoret afford curious and authentic materials for the life of John Chrysostom Besides those general historians I have taken for my guides the four principal biographers of the saint The author of a partial and passionate Vindication of the Archbishop of Constantinople composed

himself Father Montfaucon who has perused those works with the curious diligence of an editor discovered several new homilies and again reviewed and composed the life of Chrysostom Opera Chrysostom tom xiii p    A private order was dispatched to the governor of Syria and as the people might be unwilling to resign their favourite preacher he was transported with speed and secrecy in a postchariot from Antioch to Constantinople The unanimous and unsolicited consent of the court the clergy and the people ratified the choice of the minister and both as a saint and as an orator the new archbishop surpassed the sanguine expectations of the public Born of a noble and opulent family in the capital of Syria Chrysostom had been educated by the care of a tender mother under the tuition of the most skilful masters He studied the art of rhetoric in the school of Libanius and that celebrated sophist who soon discovered the talents of his disciple ingenuously confessed that John would have deserved to succeed him had he not been stolen away by the Christians His piety soon disposed  him to receive the sacrament of baptism to renounce the lucrative and honourable profession of the law and to bury himself in the adjacent desert where he subdued the lusts of the flesh by an austere pennance of six years His infirmities compelled him to return to the society of mankind and the authority of Meletius devoted his talents to the service of the church but in the midst of his family and afterwards on the archiepiscopal throne Chrysostom still persevered in the practice of the monastic virtues The ample revenues which his predecessors had consumed in pomp and luxury he deligently applied to the establishment of hospitals and the multitudes who were supported by his charity preferred the eloquent and edifying discourses of their archbishop to the amusements of the theatre or the circus The monuments of that eloquence which was admired near twenty years at Antioch and Constantinople have been carefully preserved and the possession of near one thousand sermons or homilies has authorised the critics  As I am  almost  a stranger to the voluminous sermons of Chrysostom I have given my confidence to the two most judicious and moderate of the ecclesiastical critics Erasmus tom iii p and Dupin Bibliotheque Ecclesiastique tom iii p yet the good taste of the former is sometimes vitiated by an excessive love of antiquity and the good sense of the latter is always restrained by prudential considerations  of succeeding times to appreciate the genuine merit of Chrysostom They unanimously attribute to the Christian orator the free command of an elegant and copious language the judgment to conceal the advantages which he derived  from the knowledge of rhetoric and philosophy an inexhaustible fund of metaphors and similitudes of ideas and images to vary and illustrate the most familiar topics the happy art of engaging the passions in the service of virtue and of exposing the folly as well as the turpitude of vice almost with the truth and spirit of a dramatic representation  The pastoral labours of the archbishop of Constantinople  His administration and defects A D  provoked and gradually united against him two sorts of enemies the aspiring clergy who envied his success and the obstinate sinners who were offended by his reproofs When Chrysostom thundred from the pulpit of St Sophia against the degeneracy of the Christians his shafts were spent among the crowd without wounding or even marking the character of any individual When he declaimed against the peculiar vices of the rich poverty might obtain a transient consolation from his invectives but the guilty were still sheltered by their numbers and the reproach itself was dignified by some ideas of superiority and enjoyment But as the pyramid rose towards the summit it insensibly diminished to a point and the magistrates the ministers the favourite eunuchs the ladies of the court  The females of Constantinople distinguished themselves by their enmity or their attachment to Chrysostom Three noble and opulent widows Marsa Castricia and Eugraphia were the leaders of the persecution Pallad Dialog

in a more pious cause has obtained the title of saint See Tillemont Mem Eccles tom xi    the empress Eudoxia herself had a much larger share of guilt to divide among a smaller proportion of criminals The personal applications of the audience were anticipated or confirmed by the testimony of their own conscience and the intrepid preacher assumed the dangerous right of exposing both the offence and the offender to the public abhorrence The secret resentment of the court encouraged the discontent of the clergy and monks of Constantinople who were too hastily reformed by the fervent zeal of their archbishop He had condemned from the pulpit the domestic females of the clergy of Constantinople who under the name of servants or sisters afforded a perpetual occasion either of sin or of scandal The silent and solitary ascetics who had secluded themselves from the world were intitled to the warmest approbation of Chrysostom but he despised and stigmatised as the disgrace of their holy profession the crowd of degenerate monks who from some unworthy motives of pleasure or profit so frequently infested the streets of the capital To the voice of persuasion the archbishop was obliged to add the terrors of authority and his ardour in the exercise of ecclesiastical jurisdiction was not always exempt from passion nor was it always guided by prudence Chrysostom was naturally of a choleric disposition  Sozomen and more especially Socrates have defined the real character of Chrysostom with a temperate and impartial freedom very offensive to his blind admirers Those historians lived in the next generation when party violence was abated and had conversed with many persons intimately acquainted with the virtues and imperfections of the saint  Although he struggled  according to the precepts of the gospel to love his private enemies he indulged himself in the privilege of hating the enemies of God and of the church and his sentiments were sometimes delivered with too much energy of countenance and expression He still maintained from some considerations of health or abstinence his former habits of taking his repasts alone and this inhospitable custom  Palladius tom xiii p c very seriously defends the archbishop He never tasted wine The weakness of his stomach required a peculiar diet Business or study or devotion often kept him fasting till sunset He detested the noise and levity of great dinners He saved the expence for the use of the poor He was apprehensive in a capital like Constantinople of the envy and reproach of partial invitations  which his enemies imputed to pride contributed at least to nourish the infirmity of a morose and unsocial humour Separated from that familiar intercourse which facilitates the knowledge and the dispatch of business he reposed an unsuspecting confidence in his deacon Serapion and seldom applied his speculative knowledge of human nature to the particular characters either of his dependents or of his equals Conscious of the purity of his intentions and perhaps of the superiority of his genius the archbishop of Constantinople extended the jurisdiction of the Imperial city that he might enlarge the sphere of his pastoral labours and the conduct which the profane imputed to an ambitious motive appeared to Chrysostom himself  in the light of a sacred and indispensable duty In his visitation through the Asiatic provinces he deposed thirteen bishops of Lydia and Phrygia and indiscreetly declared that a deep corruption of simony and licentiousness had infected the whole episcopal order  Chrysostom declares his free opinion tom ix hom iii in Act Apostol p that the number of bishops who might be saved bore a very small proportion to those who would be damned  If those bishops were innocent such a rash and unjust condemnation must excite a wellgrounded discontent If they were guilty the numerous associates of their guilt would soon discover that their own safety depended on the ruin of the archbishop whom they studied to represent as the tyrant of the Eastern church  This ecclesiastical conspiracy was managed by  Chrysostom is persecuted by the empress Eudoxia A D  Theophilus  See Tillemont Mem Eccles tom xi p  archbishop of Alexandria an active and ambitious prelate who displayed the fruits of rapine in monuments of ostentation His national dislike to the rising greatness of a city which degraded him

which destroy the false assertion that Chrysostom was condemned by no more than thirtysix bishops of whom twentynine were Egyptians Fortyfive bishops subscribed his sentence See Tillemont Mem Eccles tom xi p  was convened in the suburb of Chalcedon surnamed the  Oak  where Rufinus had erected a stately church and monastery and their proceedings were continued during fourteen days or sessions A bishop and a deacon accused the archbishop of Constantinople but the frivolous or improbable nature of the fortyseven articles which they presented against him may justly be considered as a fair and unexceptionable panegyric Four successive summons were signified to Chrysostom but he still refused to trust either his person or his reputation in the hands of his implacable enemies who prudently declining the examination of any particular charges condemned his contumacious disobedience and hastily pronounced a sentence of deposition The synod of the  Oak  immediately addressed the emperor to ratify and execute their judgment and charitably insinuated that the penalties of treason might be inflicted on the audacious preacher who had reviled under the name of Jezabel the empress Eudoxia herself The archbishop was rudely arrested and conducted through the city by one of the Imperial messengers who landed him after a short navigation near the entrance of the Euxine from  whence before the expiration of two days he was gloriously recalled  The first astonishment of his faithful people had  Popular tumults at Constantinople  been mute and passive they suddenly rose with unanimous and irresistible fury Theophilus escaped but the promiscuous crowd of monks and Egyptian mariners was slaughtered without pity in the streets of Constantinople  Palladius owns p that if the people of Constantinople had found Theophilus they would certainly have thrown him into the sea Socrates mentions l vi c a battle between the mob and the sailors of Alexandria in which many wounds were given and some lives were lost The massacre of the monks is observed only by the Pagan Zosimus l v p who acknowledges that Chrysostom had a singular talent to lead the illiterate multitude    A seasonable earthquake justified the interposition of heaven the torrent of sedition rolled forwards to the gates of the palace and the empress agitated by fear or remorse threw herself at the feet of Arcadius and confessed that the public safety could be purchased only by the restoration of Chrysostom The Bosphorus was covered with innumerable vessels the shores of Europe and Asia were profusely illuminated and the acclamations of a victorious people accompanied from the port to the cathedral the triumph of the archbishop who too easily consented to resume the exercise of his functions before his sentence had been legally reversed by the authority of an ecclesiastical synod Ignorant or careless of the impending danger Chrysostom indulged his zeal or perhaps his resentment declaimed with peculiar asperity against  female  vices and condemned  the profane honours which were addressed almost in the precincts of St Sophia to the statue of the empress His imprudence tempted his enemies to inflame the haughty spirit of Eudoxia by reporting or perhaps inventing the famous exordium of a sermon  "Herodias is again furious Herodias again dances she once more requires the head of John"  an insolent allusion which as a woman and a sovereign it was impossible for her to forgive  See Socrates l vi c Sozomen l viii c Zosimus l v p mentions in general terms his invectives against Eudoxia The homily which begins with those famous words is rejected as spurious Montfaucon tom xiii p Tillemont Mem Eccles tom xi p  The short interval of a perfidious truce was employed to concert more effectual measures for the disgrace and ruin of the archbishop A numerous council of the Eastern prelates who were guided from a distance by the advice of Theophilus confirmed the validity without examining the justice of the former sentence and a detachment of Barbarian troops was introduced into the city to suppress the emotions of the people On the vigil of Easter the solemn administration of baptism was rudely interrupted by the soldiers who alarmed the modesty of the naked catechumens and violated by their presence the awful mysteries of the Christian worship Arsacius occupied the church of St Sophia and the archiepiscopal throne The catholics retreated to the baths of Constantine and afterwards to the fields where they were still pursued and insulted by the  guards the bishops and the magistrates The fatal day of the second and final exile of Chrysostom was marked by the conflagration of the cathedral of the senatehouse and of the adjacent buildings and this calamity was imputed without proof but not without probability to the despair of a persecuted faction  We might naturally expect such a charge from Zosimus l v p but it is remarkable enough that it should be confirmed by

motives Post Reditum c in the language of an orator and a politician  but the submission of Chrysostom was the indispensable duty of a Christian and a subject Instead of listening to his humble prayer that he might be permitted to reside at Cyzicus or Nicomedia the inflexible empress assigned for his exile the remote and desolate town of Cucusus among the ridges of Mount Taurus in the Lesser Armenia A secret hope was entertained that the archbishop might perish in a difficult and dangerous march of seventy days in the heat of summer through the provinces of Asia Minor where he was continually threatened by the hostile attacks of the Isaurians and the more implacable fury of the monks Yet Chrysostom arrived in safety at the place of his confinement and the three years which he spent at Cucusus and the neighbouring town of Arabissus were the last and most glorious of his life His character was consecrated by absence and persecution  the faults of his administration were no longer remembered but every tongue repeated the praises of his genius and virtue and the respectful attention of the Christian world was fixed on a desert spot among the mountains of Taurus From that solitude the archbishop whose active mind was invigorated by misfortunes maintained a strict and frequent correspondence  Two hundred and fortytwo of the epistles of Chrysostom are still extant Opera tom iii p They are addressed to a great variety of persons and shew a firmness of mind much superior to that of Cicero in his exile The fourteenth epistle contains a curious narrative of the dangers of his journey  with the most distant provinces exhorted the separate congregation of his faithful adherents to persevere in their allegiance urged the destruction of the temples of Phoenicia and the extirpation of heresy in the isle of Cyprus extended his pastoral care to the missions of Persia and Scythia negociated by his ambassadors with the Roman pontiff and the emperor Honorius and boldly appealed from a partial synod to the supreme tribunal of a free and general council The mind of the illustrious exile was still independent but his captive body was exposed to the revenge of the oppressors who continued to abuse the name and authority of Arcadius  After the exile of Chrysostom Theophilus published an  enormous  and  horrible  volume against him in which he perpetually repeats the polite expressions of hostem humanitatis sacrilegorum principem immundum daemonem he affirms that John Chrysostom had delivered his soul to be adulterated by the devil and wishes that some farther punishment adequate if possible to the magnitude of his crimes may be inflicted on him St Jerom at the request of his friend Theophilus translated this edifying performance from Greek into Latin See Facundus Hermian Defens pro iii Capitul l vi c published by Sirmond Opera tom ii p  An order was dispatched for the instant  removal of Chrysostom to the extreme desert of Pityus and his guards so

coffin implored in the name of his guilty parents Arcadius and Eudoxia the forgiveness of the injured saint  According to some accounts Baronius Annal Eccles A D No the emperor was forced to send a letter of invita+tion and excuses before the body of the ceremonious saint could be moved from Comana    Yet a reasonable doubt may be entertained whether any stain of hereditary guilt could be derived from Arcadius to his successor Eudoxia  The death of Arcadius A D May  was a young and beautiful woman who indulged her passions and despised her husband Count John enjoyed at least the familiar confidence of the empress and the public named him as the real father of Theodosius the younger  Zosimus l v p The chastity of an empress should not be impeached without producing a witness but it is astonishing that the witness should write and live under a prince whose legitimacy he dared to attack We must suppose that his history was a party libel privately read and circulated by the Pagans Tillemont Hist des Empereurs tom v p is not averse to brand the reputation of Eudoxia  The birth of a son was accepted however by the pious husband as an event the most fortunate and honourable to himself to his family and to the eastern world and the royal infant by an unprecedented favour was invested with the titles of Caesar and Augustus In less than four years afterwards Eudoxia in the bloom of youth was destroyed by the consequences of a miscarriage and this untimely death confounded the prophecy of a holy bishop  Porphyry of Gaza His zeal was transported by the order which he had obtained for the destruction of eight Pagan temples of that city See the curious details of his life Baronius A D No originally written in Greek or perhaps in Syriac by a monk one of his favourite deacons  who amidst the universal joy had ventured to foretel that she should behold the long and auspicious reign of her glorious son The catholics applauded the justice of heaven which avenged the persecution of St Chrysostom and perhaps the emperor was  the only person who sincerely bewailed the loss of the haughty and rapacious Eudoxia Such a domestic misfortune afflicted  him  more deeply than the public calamities of the East  Philostorg l xi c and Godefroy Dissertat p  the licentious excursions from Pontus to Palestine of the Isaurian robbers whose impunity accused the weakness of

dark cloud between heaven and earth over the land of Palestine Seasonable winds scattered them partly into the Dead Sea and partly into the Mediterranean  which the popular discontent was equally disposed to attribute to the incapacity of the monarch At length in the thirtyfirst year of his age after a reign if we may abuse that word of thirteen years three months and fifteen days Arcadius expired in the palace of Constantinople It is impossible to delineate his character since in a period very copiously furnished with historical materials it has not been possible to remark one action that properly belongs to the son of the great Theodosius  The historian Procopius  Procopius de Bell Persic l i c p edit Louvre  has indeed illuminated  His supposed testament  the mind of the dying emperor with a ray of human prudence or celestial wisdom Arcadius considered with anxious foresight the helpless condition of his son Theodosius who was no more than seven years of age the dangerous factions of a minority and the aspiring spirit of Jezdegerd  the Persian monarch Instead of tempting the allegiance of an ambitious subject by the participation of supreme power he boldly appealed to the magnanimity of a king and placed by a solemn testament the sceptre of the East in the hands of Jezdegerd himself The royal guardian accepted and discharged this honourable trust with unexampled fidelity and the infancy of Theodosius was protected by the arms and councils of Persia Such is the singular narrative of Procopius and his veracity is not disputed by Agathias  Agathias l iv p Although he confesses the prevalence of the tradition he asserts that Procopius was the first who had committed it to writing Tillemont Hist des Empereurs tom vi p argues very sensibly on the merits of this fable His criticism was not warped by any ecclesiastical authority both Procopius and Agathias are half Pagans  while he presumes to dissent from his judgment and to arraign the wisdom of a Christian emperor who so rashly though so fortunately committed his son and his dominions to the unknown faith of a stranger a rival and a heathen At the distance of one hundred and fifty years this political question might be debated in the court of Justinian but a prudent historian will refuse to examine the  propriety  till he has ascertained the  truth  of the testament of Arcadius As it stands without a parallel in the history of the world we may justly require that it should be attested by the positive and unanimous evidence of contemporaries The strange novelty of the event which

Anthemius A D  could fairly be transferred from private property to public dominion would have adjudged to the emperor Honorius the guardianship of his nephew till he had attained at least the fourteenth year of his age But the weakness of Honorius and the calamities of his reign disqualified him from prosecuting this natural claim and such was the absolute separation of the two monarchies both in interest and affection that Constantinople would have obeyed with less reluctance the orders of the Persian than those of the Italian court Under a prince whose weakness is disguised by the external signs of manhood and discretion the most worthless favourites may secretly dispute the empire of the palace and dictate to submissive provinces the commands of a master whom they direct and despise But the ministers of a child who is incapable of arming them with the sanction of the royal name must acquire and exercise an independent authority The great officers of the state and army who had been appointed before the death of Arcadius formed an aristocracy which might have inspired them with the idea of a free republic and the government of the eastern empire was fortunately assumed by the praefect Anthemius  Socrates l vii c Anthemius was the grandson of Philip one of the ministers of Constantius and the grandfather of the emperor Anthemius After his return from the Persian

pointing to the rising sun declared to the Roman ambassadors that the course of that planet should alone terminate the conquests of the Huns But the desertion of his confederates who were privately convinced of the justice and liberality of the Imperial ministers obliged Uldin to repass the Danube the tribe of the Scyrri which composed his rearguard was almost extirpated and many thousand captives were dispersed to cultivate with servile labour the fields of Asia  Sozomen l ix c He saw some Scyrri at work near Mount Olympus in Bithynia and cherished the vain hope that those captives were the last of the nation  In the midst of the public triumph Constantinople was protected by a strong inclosure of new and more extensive walls the same vigilant care was applied to restore the fortifications of the Illyrian cities and a plan was judiciously conceived which in the space of seven years would have secured the command of the Danube by establishing on that river a perpetual

only two years older than himself received at the age of sixteen the title of  Augusta  and though her favour might be sometimes clouded by caprice or intrigue she continued to govern the Eastern empire near forty years during the long minority of her brother and after his death in her own name and in the name of Marcian her nominal husband From a motive either of prudence or religion she

and all males except the guides of their conscience the saints who had forgotten the distinction of sexes were scrupulously excluded from the holy threshold Pulcheria her two sisters and a chosen train of favourite damsels formed a religious community they renounced the vanity of dress interrupted by frequent fasts their simple and frugal diet allotted a portion of their time to works of embroidery and devoted several hours of the day and night to the exercises of prayer and psalmody The piety of a Christian virgin was adorned by the zeal and liberality of an empress Ecclesiastical history describes the splendid churches which were built at the expence of Pulcheria in all the provinces of the East her charitable foundations for the benefit of strangers and the poor the ample donations which she assigned for the perpetual maintenance of monastic societies and the active severity with which she laboured to suppress the opposite heresies of Nestorius and Eutyches Such virtues were supposed to deserve the peculiar favour of the Deity and the relics of martyrs as well as the knowledge of future events were communicated in visions and revelations to the Imperial saint  She was admonished by repeated dreams of the place where the relics of the forty martyrs had been buried The ground had successively belonged to the house and garden of a woman of Constantinople to a monastery of Macedonian monks and to a church of St Thyrsus erected by Caesarius who was consul A D and the memory of the relics was almost obliterated Notwithstanding the charitable wishes of Dr Jortin Remarks tom iv p it is not easy to acquit Pulcheria of some share in the pious fraud which must have been transacted when she was more than fiveandthirty years of age  Yet the devotion  of Pulcheria never diverted her indefatigable attention from temporal affairs and she alone among all the descendants of the great Theodosius appears to have inherited any share of his manly spirit and abilities The elegant and familiar use which she had acquired both of the Greek and Latin languages was readily applied to the various occasions of speaking or writing on public business her deliberations were maturely weighed her actions were prompt and decisive and while she moved without noise or ostentation the wheel of government she discreetly attributed to the genius of the emperor the long tranquillity of his reign In the last years of his peaceful life Europe was indeed afflicted by the arms of Attila but the more extensive provinces of Asia still continued to enjoy a profound and permanent repose Theodosius the younger was never reduced to the disgraceful necessity of encountering and punishing a rebellious subject and since we cannot applaud the vigour some praise may be due to the mildness and prosperity of the administration of Pulcheria  The Roman world was deeply interested in the  Education and character of Theodosius the younger  education of its master A regular course of study and exercise was judiciously instituted of  the military exercises of riding and shooting with the bow of the liberal studies of grammar rhetoric and philosophy the most skilful masters of the East ambitiously solicited the attention of their royal pupil and several noble youths were introduced into the palace to animate his diligence by the emulation of friendship Pulcheria alone discharged the important task of instructing her brother in the arts of government but her precepts may countenance some suspicion of the extent of her capacity or of the purity of her intentions She taught him to maintain a grave and majestic deportment to walk to hold his robes to seat himself on his throne in a manner worthy of a great prince to abstain from laughter to listen with condescension to return suitable answers to assume by turns a serious or a placid countenance in a word to represent with grace and dignity the external figure of a Roman emperor But Theodosius  There is a remarkable difference between the two ecclesiastical historians who in general bear so close a resemblance Sozomen l ix c ascribes to Pulcheria the government of the empire and the

parent whose lessons were enforced by his authority and example But the unfortunate prince who is born in the purple must remain a stranger to the voice of truth and the son of Arcadius was condemned to pass his perpetual infancy encompassed only by a servile train of women and eunuchs The ample leisure which he acquired by neglecting the essential duties of his high office was filled by idle amusements and unprofitable studies Hunting was the only active pursuit that could tempt him beyond the limits of the palace but he most assiduously laboured sometimes by the light of a midnight lamp in the mechanic occupations of painting and carving and the elegance with which he transcribed religious books entitled the Roman emperor to the singular epithet of  Calligraphes  or a fair writer Separated from the world by an impenetrable veil Theodosius trusted the persons whom he loved he loved those who were accustomed to amuse and flatter his indolence and as he never perused the papers that were presented for the royal signature the acts of injustice the most repugnant to his character were frequently perpetrated in his name The emperor himself was chaste temperate liberal and merciful but these qualities which can only deserve the name of virtues when they are supported by courage and  regulated by discretion were seldom beneficial and they sometimes proved mischievous to mankind His mind enervated by a royal education was oppressed and degraded by abject superstition he fasted he sung psalms he blindly accepted the miracles and doctrines with which his faith was continually nourished Theodosius devoutly worshipped the dead and living saints of the Catholic church and he once refused to eat till an insolent monk who had cast an excommunication on his sovereign

pictures of the empress Eudocia The modern Greeks Zonaras Cedrenus c have displayed the love rather than the talent of fiction From Nicephorus indeed I have ventured to assume her age The writer of a romance would not have  imagined  that Athenais was near twentyeight years old when she inflamed the heart of a young emperor  was educated by her father Leontius in the religion and sciences of the Greeks and so advantageous was the opinion which the Athenian philosopher entertained of his contemporaries  that he divided his patrimony between his two sons bequeathing to his daughter a small legacy of one hundred pieces of gold in the lively confidence that her beauty and merit would be a sufficient portion The jealousy and avarice of her brothers soon compelled Athenais to seek a refuge at Constantinople and with some hopes either of justice or favour to throw herself at the feet of Pulcheria That sagacious princess listened to her eloquent complaint and secretly destined the daughter of the philosopher Leontius for the future wife of the emperor of the East who had now attained the twentieth year of his age She easily excited the curiosity of her brother by an interesting picture of the charms of Athenais large eyes a wellproportioned nose a fair complexion golden locks a slender person a graceful demeanour an understanding improved by study and a virtue tried by distress Theodosius concealed behind a curtain in the apartment of his sister was permitted to behold the Athenian virgin the modest youth immediately declared his pure and honourable love and the royal nuptials were celebrated amidst the acclamations of the capital and the provinces Athenais who was easily persuaded to renounce the errors of Paganism received at her baptism the Christian name of Eudocia but the cautious Pulcheria withheld the title of Augusta till the wife of Theodosius had approved her fruitfulness by the birth of a daughter who espoused fifteen years afterwards the emperor of the West The  brothers of Eudocia obeyed with some anxiety her Imperial summons but as she could easily forgive their fortunate unkindness she indulged the tenderness or perhaps the vanity of a sister by promoting them to the rank of consuls and praefects In the luxury of the palace she still cultivated those ingenious arts which had contributed to her greatness and wisely dedicated her talents to the honour of religion and of her husband Eudocia composed a poeticall paraphrase of the first eight books of the Old Testament and of the prophecies of Daniel and Zachariah a cento of the verses of Homer applied to the life and miracles of Christ the legend of St Cyprian and a panegyric on the Persian victories of Theodosius and her writings which were applauded by a servile and superstitious age have not been disdained by the candour of impartial criticism  Socrates l vii c Photius p The Homeric cento is still extant and has been repeatedly printed but the claim of Eudocia to that insipid performance is disputed by the critics See Fabricius Biblioth Graec tom i p The  Ionia  a miscellaneous dictionary of history and fable was compiled by another empress of the name of Eudocia who lived in the eleventh century and the work is still extant in manuscript  The fondness of the emperor was not abated by time and possession and Eudocia after the marriage of her daughter was permitted to discharge her grateful vows by a solemn pilgrimage to Jerusalem Her ostentatious progress through the East may seem inconsistent with the spirit of Christian humility she pronounced from a throne of gold and gems an  eloquent oration to the senate of Antioch declared her royal intention of enlarging the walls of the city bestowed a donative of two hundred pounds of gold to restore the public baths and accepted the statues which were decreed by the gratitude of Antioch In the Holy Land her alms and pious foundations exceeded the munificence of the great Helena and though the public treasure might be impoverished by this excessive liberality she enjoyed the conscious satisfaction of returning to Constantinople with the chains of St Peter the right arm of St Stephen and an undoubted picture of the Virgin painted by St Luke  Baronius Annal Eccles A D is copious and florid but he is accused of placing the lies of different ages on the same level of authenticity  But this pilgrimage was the fatal term of the glories of Eudocia Satiated with empty pomp and unmindful perhaps of her obligations to Pulcheria she ambitiously aspired to the government of the Eastern empire the palace was distracted by female discord but the victory was at last decided by the superior ascendant of the sister of Theodosius The execution of Paulinus master of the offices and the disgrace of Cyrus Praetorian praefect of the East convinced the public that the favour of Eudocia was insufficient to protect her most faithful friends and the uncommon beauty of Paulinus encouraged the secret rumour that his guilt was that of a successful lover  In this short view of the disgrace of Eudocia I have imitated the caution of Evagrius l i c and count Marcellinus in Chron A D and The two authentic dates assigned by the latter overturn a great part of the Greek fictions and the celebrated story of the  apple  c is fit only for the Arabian Nights where something not very unlike it may be found  As soon as the  empress perceived that the affection of Theodosius was irretrievably lost she requested the permission of retiring to the distant solitude of Jerusalem She obtained her request but the jealousy of Theodosius or the vindictive spirit of Pulcheria pursued her in her last retreat and Saturninus count of the domestics was directed to punish with death two ecclesiastics her most favoured servants Eudocia instantly revenged them by the assassination of the count the furious passions which she indulged on this suspicious occasion seemed to justify the severity of Theodosius and the empress ignominiously stript of the honours of her rank  Priscus in Excerpt Legat p a contemporary and a courtier drily mentions her Pagan and Christian names without adding any title of honour or respect  was disgraced perhaps unjustly in the eyes of the world The remainder of the life of Eudocia about sixteen years was spent in exile and devotion and the approach of age the death of Theodosius the misfortunes of her only daughter who was led a captive from Rome to Carthage and the society of the Holy Monks of Palestine insensibly confirmed the religious temper of her mind After a full experience of the vicissitudes of human life the daughter of the philosopher Leontius expired at Jerusalem in the sixtyseventh year of her age protesting with her dying breath  that she had never transgressed the bounds of innocence and friendship  For the  two  pilgrimages of Eudocia and her long residence at Jerusalem her devotion alms c see Socrates l vii c and Evagrius l i c

conquest or military renown and the slight alarm of a Persian war scarcely interrupted the tranquillity of the East The motives of this war were just and honourable In the last year of the reign of Jezdegerd the supposed guardian of Theodosius a bishop who aspired to the crown of martyrdom destroyed one of the firetemples of Susa  Theodoret l v c Tillemont Mem Eccles tom xii p Assemanni bibliot Oriental tom iii p tom iv p Theodoret blames the rashness of Abdas but extols the constancy of his martyrdom Yet I do not clearly understand the casuistry which prohibits our repairing the damage which we have unlawfully committed  His zeal and obstinacy were revenged on his brethren the Magi excited a cruel persecution and the intolerant zeal of Jezdegerd was imitated by his son Vararanes or Bahram who soon afterwards ascended the throne Some Christian fugitives who escaped to the Roman frontier were sternly demanded and generously refused and the refusal aggravated by commercial disputes soon kindled a war between the rival monarchies The mountains of Armenia and the plains of Mesopotamia  were filled with hostile armies but the operations of two successive campaigns were not productive of any decisive or memorable events Some engagements were fought some towns were besieged with various and doubtful success and if the Romans failed in their attempt to recover the long lost possession of Nisibis the Persians were repulsed from the walls of a Mesopotamian city by the valour of a martial bishop who pointed his thundering engine in the name of St Thomas the Apostle Yet the splendid victories which the incredible speed of the messenger Palladius repeatedly announced to the palace of Constantinople were celebrated with festivals and panegyrics From these panegyrics the  Socrates l vii c is the best author for the Persian war We may likewise consult the three Chronicles the Paschal and those of Marcellinus and Malala  historians of the age might borrow their extraordinary and perhaps fabulous tales of the proud challenge of a Persian hero who was entangled by the net and dispatched by the sword of Areobindus the Goth of the ten thousand  Immortals  who were slain in the attack of the Roman camp and of the hundred thousand Arabs or Saracens who were impelled by a panic terror to throw themselves headlong into the Euphrates Such events may be disbelieved or disregarded but the charity of a bishop Acacius of Amida whose name might have dignified the saintly calendar shall not be lost in oblivion Boldly declaring that vases of gold and silver are useless to a God  who neither eats nor drinks the generous prelate sold the plate of the church of Amida employed the price in the redemption of seven thousand Persian captives supplied their wants with affectionate liberality and dismissed them to their native country to inform the king of the true spirit of the religion which he persecuted The practice of benevolence in the midst of war must always tend to assuage the animosity of contending nations and I wish to persuade myself that Acacius contributed to the restoration of peace In the conference which was held on the limits of the two empires the Roman ambassadors degraded the personal character of their sovereign by a vain attempt to magnify the extent of his power when they seriously advised the Persians to prevent by a timely accommodation the wrath of a monarch who was yet ignorant of this distant war A truce of one hundred years was solemnly ratified and although the revolutions of Armenia might threaten the public tranquillity the essential conditions of this treaty were respected near fourscore years by the successors of Constantine and Artaxerxes  Since the Roman and Parthian standards first  Armenia divided between the Persians and the Romans  encountered on the banks of the Euphrates the kingdom of Armenia  This account of the ruin and division of the kingdom of Armenia is taken from the third book of the Armenian history of Moses of Chorene Deficient as he is in every qualification of a good historian his local information his passions and his prejudices are strongly expressive of a native and contemporary Procopius de Edificiis l iii c relates the same facts in a very different manner but I have extracted the circumstances the most probable in themselves and the least inconsistent with Moses of Chorene  was alternately oppressed  by its formidable protectors and in the course of this History several events which inclined the balance of peace and war have been already related  A D  A disgraceful treaty had resigned Armenia to the ambition of Sapor and the scale of Persia appeared to preponderate But the royal race of Arsaces impatiently submitted to the house of Sassan the turbulent nobles asserted or betrayed their hereditary independence and the nation was still attached to the  Christian  princes of Constantinople In the beginning of the fifth century Armenia was divided by the progress of war and faction  The western Armenians used the Greek language and characters in their religious offices but the use of that hostile tongue was prohibited by the Persians in the eastern provinces which were obliged to use the Syriac till the invention of the Armenian letters by Mesrobes in the beginning of the fifth century and the subsequent version of the Bible into the Armenian language an event which relaxed the connection of the church and nation with Constantinople  and the unnatural division precipitated the downfal of that ancient monarchy Chosroes the Persian vassal reigned over the Eastern and most extensive portion of the country while the Western province acknowledged the jurisdiction of Arsaces and the supremacy of the emperor Arcadius After the death of Arsaces the Romans suppressed the regal government and imposed on their allies the condition of subjects The military command was delegated to the count of the Armenian frontier the city of Theodosiopolis  Moses Choren l iii c p and p Procopius de Edificiis l iii c Theodosiopolis stands or rather stood about thirtyfive miles to the east of Arzeroum the modern capital of Turkish Armenia See d'Anville Geographie Ancienne tom ii p  was built and fortified in  a strong situation on a fertile and lofty ground near the sources of the Euphrates and the dependent territories were ruled by five satraps whose dignity was marked by a peculiar habit of gold and purple The less fortunate nobles who lamented the loss of their king and envied the honours of their equals were provoked to negociate their peace and pardon at the Persian court and returning with their followers to the palace of Artaxata acknowledged Chosroes for their lawful sovereign About thirty years afterwards Artasires the nephew and successor of Chosroes fell under the displeasure of the haughty and capricious nobles of Armenia and they unanimously desired a Persian governor in the room of an unworthy king The answer of the archbishop Isaac whose sanction they earnestly solicited is expressive of the character of a superstitious people He deplored the manifest and inexcusable vices of Artasires and declared that he should not hesitate to accuse him before the tribunal of a Christian emperor who would punish without destroying the sinner "Our king" continued Isaac  "is too much addicted to licentious pleasures but he has been purified in the holy waters of baptism He is a lover of women but he does not adore the fire or the elements He may deserve the reproach of lewdness but he is an undoubted Catholic and his faith is pure though his manners are flagitious  I will never consent to abandon my sheep to the rage of devouring wolves and you would soon repent your rash exchange of the infirmities of a believer for the specious virtues of an heathen  Moses Choren l iii c p According to the institution of St Gregory the apostle of Armenia the archbishop was always of the royal family a circumstance which in some degree corrected the influence of the sacerdotal character and united the mitre with the crown  "  Exasperated by the firmness of Isaac the factious nobles accused both the king and the archbishop as the secret adherents of the emperor and absurdly rejoiced in the sentence of condemnation which after a partial hearing was solemnly pronounced by Bahram himself The descendants of Arsaces were degraded from the royal dignity  A branch of the royal house of Arsaces still subsisted with the rank and possessions as it should seem of Armenian satraps See Moses Choren l iii c p  which they had possessed above five hundred and sixty years  Valarsaces was appointed king of Armenia by his brother the Parthian monarch immediately after the defeat of Antiochus Sidetes Moses Choren l ii c p one hundred and thirty years before Christ Without depending on the various and contradictory periods of the reigns of the last kings we may be assured that the ruin of the Armenian kingdom happened after the council of Chalcedon A D l iii c p and under Veramus or Bahram king of Persia l iii c p who reigned from A D to See Assemanni Bibliot Oriental tom iii p  and the dominions of the unfortunate Artasires under the new and significant appellation of Persarmenia were reduced into the form of a province This usurpation excited the jealousy of the Roman government but the rising disputes  were soon terminated by an amicable though unequal partition of the ancient kingdom of Armenia and a territorial acquisition which Augustus might have despised reflected some lustre on the declining empire of the younger Theodosius  END OF THE FIFTH VOLUME
