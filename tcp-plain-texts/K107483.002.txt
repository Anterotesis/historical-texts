Declaration of Love as if acting against  Custom  was  sinning  against  Right  As many make it their  Tenet  that Men if they but know a Woman loves them will ungratefully shun her and play Tricks of an unnatural Disdain I doubt not but the Gentleman who is concerned in the following excellent Letter will give a Refu∣tation  to these mischievous Opinions and shew for the  Honour  of  one  Sex and the  Ease  of the  other  that they ought hereafter to sink among  vulgar Errors  To the  PLAIN DEALER  Octob    SIR  I AM an unhappy Young Woman that want a little of your  Plain Dealing  and good  Advice  to help me out in an Affair of the utmost Consequence to my Peace I am in too much pain to make a long In∣troduction therefore hope you will excuse me if I only send a short Sketch of my Misfortune without staying to pay my grateful Thanks for your agreeable Week∣ly Entertainments which I can never enough Admire I hope you won't think me troublesome if I relate the exact Situ∣ation of Life I at present am in I live in a fine Old Seat in  Surrey  which wants nothing to render it delightful to a Person of my Temper Our Family consists of my Father who is a Widower an old Maiden Aunt two Sisters and my Self My Father is a very good Man and em∣ploys himself mostly in his Study My Aunt is of a reserv'd Temper therefore suffers us to keep but little Company es∣pecially with Gentlemen There is only one Person allow'd that fatal Liberty Whose Character I must make you acquaint∣ed  with But how alas shall I do that Yet if there is such a Thing as Perfection in Mankind he certainly is Master of it He has so fine an Understanding in all Arts and Sciences allow'd by his own Sex so great a Knowledge in every thing that is Polite and Agreeable and withal so sweet a Disposition that I only wonder I kept my Heart so long free from his irresistable Charms I have been pretty intimate with him these Three Years but did not know 'till within these Three Months that my Happiness or Misery depended intirely up∣on him In short I feel so violent a Pas∣sion in my Breast that unless I have some speedy Relief Death will soon put a Pe∣riod to my Sorrow How often have I sate contemplating his Virtues and Charms 'till my Soul has almost dissolv'd away in Ten∣derness and Love I sigh I die for him while he views me with Cold Indifference or at best but Lukewarm Friendship Tyrant Custom and innate Modesty for∣bid my Tongue to utter the Tortures of my Heart He sometimes laughs and says I am all Charms Oh what wou'd I give to have him really think so He behaves exactly alike to my self and Sisters and yet I can't help being jealous if he speaks or looks at them I am all Madness and De∣spair I han't the Vanity to think I can ever please a Man of his Sense and Judg∣ment and yet I go on to love Sometimes  I think my constant Passion will be re∣warded and that he will like me for my good Nature which some People flatter me and tell him I have a great Share of And as it is a Qualification he very much admires I strive every Day to improve it and to command all those little Passions that are incident to our Sex Was I suf∣fer'd to plead for my self I cou'd tell him What an obedient Wife I'd make him How my Duty and Inclinations wou'd both concur to please him in all Actions of my Life When he was absent I wou'd enter∣tain my self with his dear Idea and when he return'd meet him with inexpressible Raptures I cou'd dwell for ever on the in∣chanting Subject But fear I should grow tiresome This opening of my Grief has been some Relief I almost fear to have this published I wish yet dread he should discover me I don't know what to do Therefore rely wholly upon your Advice If you print it correct the bad  English  if you burn it Remember and Pity  The poor  LUCINDA  WHAT constant Companions are  Merit  and  Humility  How does this Lady conclude a Letter that must charm  every Reader If you print it correct the bad English  It is too good to be corrected Sincerity and everlast∣ing Tenderness shine forth in every Sentence That Person who does not plainly perceive  that what  Lucinda  has written flow'd from her Heart must have his own Heart ill pla∣ced and removed out of the Way of  Nature  If Men could write thus no Woman of Sense would be ever courted in vain When she signifies so  plainly  that she loves him from her Heart how cordially does she labour to make that  Plainness  still  plainer  if possible as she proceeds still  farther  in her Letter These plain Phrases are the Mastertouches of  Nature  and put  Art  out of Countenance This is the natural Simplicity that makes the  proud  Scholar's Ornaments look  poor  Any body that knows what Love is will not barely  read  but  feel  this Lady's Letter Old as I am my self how am I warm'd when she expresses her Tenderness And if every  unconcerned  Person be her  Wellwisher  what  Emotions  must this Letter be able to raise in the Bosom of that happy Man whom it  concerns  Will not her Prudence her vow'd Obedience her Study to please her Humi∣lity and being unconscious of the greatest Worth in her self her whole Pride placed in admiring him her Adoration almost of his superior Merit her desiring and yet diffi∣ding to deserve him Will not all these win over his Soul to her Where she describes to him how she will behave in his Presence and how in his Absence what a Figure must she make in the Imagination of this ad∣mired Man Must she not be as much admi∣red as she admires Does she not force him  to what she so earnestly  wishes  The God of Love lives breathes and acts in every Line of it and nothing less than THAT VERY MAN who as she says  If there be such a thing as Perfection in Mankind is certainly Master of it  can be a  suitable Prize  for her  Merit  IT has been reported concerning the  finest Orator  of the present Age that the Lady to whom he was married grew his  Wife  by being his  Client  He had long been acquaint∣ed with her Patience Temper and Spirit by her Manner of soliciting her own Cause He knew her Fortune which depended upon it she gave him such full and elegant Instructi∣ons as few profess'd Lawyers could have Penn'd and as scarce needed his own power∣ful Assistance and Amendment He ask'd her who had drawn them and being in∣formed her self had been the Compiler it is no wonder that so much Wit in so agree∣able a Person made that greatest of Orators whose Addresses no Lady could withstand from that Moment her Suiter and conse∣quently her Husband  I HAVE often wish'd to be fully satisfied of the Truth of this little beautiful Piece of Secret HistoryBut whether it be true in all its Circumstances it was not invented by one who meant to malign the Fame of that Lord or the Merit of his Lady since a more glorious Accident could not well be assigned to have brought about the Marri∣age of so illustrious a Pair  THE Letter which now lies before me is the most exquisite Plea that ever my Eyes beheld I know some who understand not what Love is will be offended at a Woman's first declaring her Passion How sensible is the Fair One of this when she cries out  Tyrant Custom and innate Modesty forbid my Tongue to utter the Tortures of my Heart  By  Lucinda  's Leave she  herself  is too rigid and severe  against herself  Custom indeed does forbid it and a Tyrannical Custom it is because though pretendedly grounded upon the Colours of Modesty 'tis unjust 'tis un∣natural and irreligious at the BottomIs it not  modest  as well as  natural  to have an Inclination to be honourably married She that has  not  an Inclination  before  she is ask'd can hardly with Truth declare  Inclination  And if it was an Inclination vertuous and honourable from the Beginning it must have been equally vertuous and honourable from the Beginning to have owned it A dull and obstinate Concealment of the Truth 'till it  happens  to be  extorted  is a  Triumph  given to  Folly  over  Nature  for the Sake of a  mistaken Modesty  Both Sexes if they will but reflect must  agree  in this  Truth    WHAT Batchelor of good Sense would not be overjoy'd to discover a  Lucinda  thus opening in his own Favour The Man who disliked a Woman for declaring her Approba∣tion of him would be like one who seck∣ing for a Silver Mine and discovering by  chance a Golden one shou'd desert it for no other Reason but because good Fortune had put it in his Way  THERE is a vast deal of Delight in con∣templating the Beauties of a Woman's Mind who could write thus delicately How hap∣py would she make her Husband She would sooth any Sorrow that could  reach  him and  exalt  his  Pleasures  into  Raptures  she would be his  Comfort  in  Adversity  and  gild  and  adorn  his  Prosperity  she would  gladden  his  Youth  and  cherish  his  Age  give more  Warmth  and  Joy  to the  Summer  of his  Life  and yield  Gaity  and  Refreshment  to his  Winter  she would give  Wings  to his  Business  Abroad and  divert  him at Home with her  Conversation  she would fill up the  Vacuities  of  Solitude  with Discourse that was prefer∣rable to the  Company  of  Wits  no  Nights  could be  tedious  by her Side and  Daylight  would be made more  chearful  by  looking  upon her  BUT I draw towards a Conclusion as fast as I can for fear of hindring any longer what I would speedily unite I fancy my self to be this Minute with my Paper in the Parlour of that fine Old Seat in  Surrey Lucinda  and her Lover have both hold of the  Plain Dealer  who tells them his Senti∣ments like the Father of them bothI hear him reading I see her wishing and yet dreading to be discoveredI wish the Dis∣covery my selfMethinks I see it and hear  him say  You are  Lucinda  I have often told you You are all Charms There wants no∣thing but your Consent to make us the happy Couple here describedLucinda  trembling holds the Paper as she would let it dropNow if I could make my Paper speak it should say  Do drop me from between you join Hands over a more Sacred WritingIt is so promising a Match that the  Plain Dealer  is to act the  Father  in itIf you have not imme∣diate OpportunitiesIf you apprehend any Hin∣dranceStay not a Moment where you areTake a Tour to  BluntHall  togetherThe  Clergyman  of our  Assembly  shall join your Hands and bless your Wishes and you may keep your Wedding at the  ancient Seat  of the  Blunt  's since it will be so happy an Example to many Maids who have been scared so long by a silly groundless Custom from speaking their Minds in an Affair on which depends all their Feli∣city  The Plain Dealer N  o    Cur in Theatrum  Cato  severe venisti  MART  MONDAY  October    IT is the Duty of a Patriot to mourn for those growing Evils which seem to threaten either the Safety or the Honour of his Country And for this Reason I have often been irresistably chagrin'd at the Cor∣ruption of our Publick  Theatres  But I was lately enliven'd into  Hope  upon this Subject and am glad I can assure my Rea∣der that there is a Spirit of Improvement at Work to sustain our sinking Taste and set Examples for our present Stages  THERE is a generous Boldness as well in the  Design  itself as in the  Time  of putting it in Execution But nothing is more certain than that it is form'd upon a Plan which if it meets with the propos'd Encouragement will go a great Way toward keeping the Hearts of the Gay World from breaking should so dreadful a Misfortune happen as that the God of Wit revenges himself upon the pro∣stituted  Theatres in Fashion by making Peo∣ple asham'd of  appearing  where they ought to blush at their Entertainment  I AM transported to this Pitch of Joy up∣on having Landed at  Westminster  Stairs in my Way from  Barbican  to the  Abbey Cloi∣sters  where I often muse on Subjects which a long Time hence may fill  Plain Dealers  and met in the King's Highway a Partycolour'd younger Brother of the justlycele∣brated Mr  Lun  He was usher'd along in great State with a sounding Drum in his  Front  and a Trumpet and  French  Horn plac'd like Wings on either  Flank  while the  Rear  was brought up by a Body of scatter'd  Velites  the flying Fragments of Humanity  THE  Checquer'd Nuntio  as I pass'd him stopt and nodded his loose Head at me Snatching off his Pigmy Hat by the Rab∣bit's Tail which was annex'd to it And tripping toward me with a wanton  Waviness  like the Curling of a Ship's long Pendant when it dances in a Breeze slipt a  Billet  into my Hand and retreating with a merry Shrugg or two resum'd his Post as before and gave Continuance to the Procession  FROM the ludicrous Turn of his Figure I open'd the Paper he gave me with very humble Expectation But was struck with no small Reverence when I beheld the  Royal Arms  magisterially display'd at the Head of it And These surprizing Particulars pro∣mulg'd under the Stamp of such a known Authority  By His MAJESTY's PERMISSION For the better Accommodation of  Gentlemen Ladies  and  Others  AT the  WhiteHart  in St  Margaret  's  Lane  is to be seen in a Manner never Perform'd before The whole Play of  HERO  and  LEANDER  with a  LIVE  PUNCH  Perform'd by a Company of ARTIFICIAL ACTORS whose Diversions are very  Change∣able  and  Consistivarious  THE Figures  being Five Foot high  per∣form with that  Nicety  that they can hardly be distinguish'd from the  Live Players  and give an  Equal Satisfaction  LIKEWISE you will see the Dancing of  Jigs Masquerades  and  SarabandsLike∣wise  the Royal Court of  Foreign Kings Queens  and  Princes  Every Figure  dress'd  according to their  own Country HabitsLikewise  the Rising and Setting of the Sun  Also  CUPID's Paradise  Likewise Cupid  descending out of the  Clouds  to the Front of the Stage and speaks the  Prologue  to the Play  BEFORE the Play begins there is a  High German Artist  that takes an  empty Bag  and turns it inside out that you may see there is  nothing in it  and then conveys  Showers of Gold and Eggs  out of it  THE Prices are from  Two Shillings  down to  Sixpence  And we begin at the  Quality Hours  THERE are very good Seats for  Gentlemen  and Places for  Coaches  and  Chairs  to stand in  Note  Any  Gentleman  and  Lady  may have a  Play in Private  any Hour of the Day giving Notice beforehand  VIVAT REX  I FOUND myself not a little delighted upon perusing this  Notification  to be assur'd in so Authentick a Manner that we have  His Majesty's Permission  to be  better accommo∣dated  than we have been For from this  in∣tentional  Royal Grace I grew sanguine enough to expect a very sudden Revocation of certain Grants for Monopolizing the  Art of Conjuring  and of bewitching the King's Liege People out of all sober Use as well of their  Money  as their  Senses  I enter'd therefore with Pleasure on the Divisions of my printed Billet And began with a Criti∣cal Eye to examine what Likelihood there was that  Hero  and  Leander  should be too hard for the  Devil  and his  Double Favourites  THE  Live Punch  though they seem to build much upon him I cou'd consider as no great RarityNot that I wou'd derogate in the least from that Respect which is due to his Character But he has  Brothers  upon both Stages as much  alive  as himself with the Advantage of being more incomprehen∣sible    Punch  will be  understood  with so little Difficulty that our People of  Polite Taste  will never be able to  bear  himBut when I had read about half a Line lower and came to that Part of the Declaration which promises  That the Actors of this  new Company  shall be  ARTIFICIAL I was presently at Ease again For in that Case I saw most certainly that there must be No∣velty in their Design since nothing is more generally allow'd with Regard to the  other  Companies than That for  One  of their Actors who is  Artificial  Six are absolutely  Naturals  I GATHER'D much Consolation too from that other welcome Assurance That the Di∣versions of  this  Royal Company are to be very  Changeable  and  Consistivarious  The Town has Annually for some Years past been  dieted  by the  Playhouse Doctors  And gone through a  Regular Course of Bitters  with a most laudable Spirit of  Meekness  and true Christian  Resignation  Their  Wit  was fall'n  Sick  and submitted to  Quack Potions  Because Mountebank Stages by being  Li∣cens'd  had the Reputation of  College Practice  And to poison by  Authority  has the good Fortune to be  no Felony  So that nothing is more certain than that the  Wooden  Com∣pany will have the Advantage of our  Brazen  Ones in this important Point  the Changeable  BUT as for the  Consistivarious  the old Workmen I am afraid will be more than a  Match for the new OnesI am not in∣deed so able a Critick in the Language of these Wooden Orators as to decide with any absolute Sufficiency the Signification of a Word so Derivative and Complex as  Consi∣stivarious  But if I am fortunate enough to have rightly broke in upon so impregnable a  Decomposite  then I am sure I may safely affirm That our Stage's Conduct ever since I can remember it has been  truly Consistiva∣rious  in the most remarkable and surprizing MannerNay a  Triumvir  of that de∣tach'd Administration the accomplished Au∣thor of a  Tragedy  which we are to be admit∣ted to the Honour of  admiring  in the Front of this happy Season is I am sure so re∣nown'd for his  Consistivariousness  that one wou'd almost be induc'd to swear That the very  Word  was of his  own making  and coin'd on Purpose for his  New Tragedy  BUT here let me correct a false Report which this Great Writer suffers under by the Means of some who envy him the Honours which are due to his  undoubting Genius  It is said the Name of his New Tragedy is to be  Caesar in Egypt  But I assure all Chri∣stian People that though  Caesar  may stand in Capitals on the  Title Page  yet that shou'd only be consider'd as an  Error of the Press  which the Buyer may  correct  with Ease by reading CIBBER  in Egypt  instead of CAESAR And with that small Alteration every Thing in this Tragedy will be found  extremely Natural and stand directly as it  shou'd  be  THE Spirit however of our new Under∣takers at the  WhiteHart  is inflam'd into an enterprizing and smart  Emulation  And I was very much taken with the Turn of this brisk DefianceThat tho' they may pass for  Nobodies  because they are made of  Wood  yet since they have the Good Luck to be  five Foot high  they see no Reason to suppose their Adversaries to be  more than their Match  and will therefore  perform with such Nicety as not to be distinguish'd from them  and doubt not in the least to give an  equal Satisfaction  AS for the next Paragraph I fear it was purposely embroider'd over with those  Like∣wises  and  Also's  for no other Reason in the World but to cover a conscious Deficiency in the  Sense  by the Eloquent Glare of the  Ex∣pression  For who does not observe That  Dancing of Jigs Masquerades and Sarabands  are Improvements in Learning which the happy Genius of our  Nobility  and the vast Encouragement they give to  Wit  have brought already to their full PerfectionI can't see therefore what Novelty can be expected in this Particular Unless when they give Notice That  All their Performers are to be Wooden ones  they wou'd have us understand it that by Aid of some  third Faustus  their  Fiddles  are to fall a  Dancing  and keep Time to their own Musick  THE Rising and Setting of the  Sun  I have very little to say for with Regard to its  NewnessCupid  's  Paradise  may please at first but will flatten if they shew it oftenThe  Court of Foreign Kings  is no such  Rarity  as they think itBut for every Figure to be  dress'd  according to their  own Country Fashion  That indeed is a Stroke of  Decorum  which outsoars at one Flight  Patent License  and  Charter  And it will be reasonable to hope after the Publick Taste has been so refin'd by these  Chips of a new Block  that we shall see no more Intermixture of the Ancient with the Modern Dresses Where the Order of Things is so capriciously revers'd that the Courtiers of an  English  Monarch shall stand round him like  Beaux of Yesterday  and the Sovereign himself strut about in Trunk Breeches and be dress'd as  old  as a  Patriarch  THERE is in the next Article an odd kind of Mystery which I own I could not fathom And I frankly confess I was once afraid there might be a  Plot  in itI puzzled my Imagination till I was weary of imagin∣ingBut the more I mus'd upon it the  less  I was able to  make  of that strange  HighGerman Artist who was to shake an empty Bag inside out that we might see there was nothing in it And then rain Gold and Eggs out of it  IT was easily to be discern'd that the  Scene  was  shifted  in this PlaceThe  Playhouses  could have nothing to do with the Pa∣ragraph None of  Their  Bags for some Years past having been  Empty  enough to turn in∣side outward So that I was greatly per∣plex'd by the Knottiness of this Difficulty Till I luckily bethought myself of a Friend of mine a  Decypherer  whose surprizing Dexterity levell'd every Rub in his Way and made it as plain as a Demonstration That the empty Bag was the  SouthSea Scheme  That the Golden Showers were the  sudden Sallies of that Stock  And that the  Eggs  were the  sucking Bubbles  that were  hatch'd  under the Warmth of it  I SHOULD have been  lost  in this  Desart  if I had not return'd to make a Remark concerning the  Modesty  of our new Comedi∣ansHow praiseworthy is their Genero∣sity and the Disinterestedness of their Spirit Who after putting themselves to the twofold Charge of  building  both their  Stage  and their  Performers  propose to act notwith∣standing at  Lower Rates  than their Rivals which Last go on to  demolish  as fast as their Competitors can  build up  And yet have the Courage to  raise  their Prices because they  fall  their Entertainments  THEN how just and how  Sympathetical  is another Care of our Wooden ReformersBeing perfectly acquainted with the Talents of a Modish Audience they have judiciously determined to provide Room for the  Coaches  and  Chairs  in the same Para∣graph  with the  Gentlemen  Their Thoughts were more upon  Merit  than upon  Good Breeding  And since they knew that their  Kindred Vehicles  were as  able Judges  as their  Owners  and which is of more Consequence as  welldress'd  too they therefore thought it but reasonable to treat 'em with equal Re∣verence  WHAT kind of  Play  that may be which any  Gentleman  and  Lady  who give Notice beforehand are to be diverted with  in Pri∣vate  I must make a Personal Search into before I undertake to consider itBut upon the Whole I believe there can be no manner of Doubt but that  The WhiteHart in St Margaret  's  Lane  may bid as fair for  Fine Audiences  as any of the Rest of our Theatres where though the Actors are not  of Wood  they have usurp'd the Province of  Wooden Actors  The Plain Dealer N  o    Pictoribus atque Poetis  HOR  FRIDAY  October    WHEN I read with Admiration the great  Actions  of an  Alexander  a  Caesar  or a  Tamerlane  or an charm'd by the more powerful  Writings  of a  Homer  a  Virgil  or a  Cicero  I am fir'd with an impatient Longing to conceive their Turn of  Person Air  and  Features  And when my Fancy forc'd to travel without a Guide has tir'd itself with vain Endeavours to  grasp  Ideas that are  thin  and  fleeting  I lament that the  Materials  of the  Painter  's  noble Art  are not as  lasting  as the  Painter  's Fame is For in that case Two  Sister Arts  uniting their different Pow∣ers the one transmitting  Souls  the other  Bodies  or the outward Form of Bodies their combining Influence would be of Force to frustrate  Death itself  And all the Ages of the World would seem to be  Cotempo∣raries  BUT here the  Poet  triumphs His Works  outlive  the  Painter  's though the Pain∣ter  begins much sooner to be famous than the Poet does And has also commonly the Advantage over him with Relation to  For∣tune  The strongest Reasons of which Diffe∣rence I have lately read with Pleasure in the following Letter from an excellent and learned Critick whom I spoke of in a late Paper and whose  Encouragement  I am afraid is to the future Reproach of our Age most shamefully disproportioned to his  Merit  THERE is something extremely  new  in the Subject as well as the Sentiments of this Letter And I will therefore take the Li∣berty to publish it for my Reader's Enter∣tainment though the Author when he writ it meant it only for the private Satisfaction of a Gentleman of his Acquaintance  October  the th  SIR  I KNOW not whether I should return you Thanks for your last Visit or not because I know not whether I am indebted to Fortune or to You for it But I am obliged to take Notice in a particular Man∣ner of the Desire you express'd during our being together that I would have my  Picture drawn  AFTER I have omitted it so many Years I would not have it drawn at last by a  Bungler  and I am not in a Condition at present to satisfy one who is a Master nor do I know whether we have any Master  who would make me a  Present  of it Though a Painter is much more able to  give  than a Poet to  buy  which has put me upon consider∣ing what are the Reasons which make the  Painter  so successful and the  Poet  so un∣fortunate that make the Art of Poetry and the Art of Painting which are Sisters so very  Resembling  by  Nature  so very  Dif∣ferent  by  Fortune  A great  Poet  for the most Part neglects and affronts  Fortune  by making his Court to  Fame  but Fame and  Fortune  are  Rivals  that contend with each other which shall heap most Favours upon the deserving  Pain∣ter  All the great Painters that have ap∣peared among us have had Justice done to their Merit while they  liv'd  and no  SignpostPainter  has ever yet pass'd for a  great Master  All the Painters whom our Kings have delighted to employ have been Ma∣sters as  Holbin Rubens Vandyck Leeley Ryley Kneller  and  Thornhill  BUT the contrary of this has happened with Regard to  Poets  Several good ones nay several of the  best  have been neglect∣ed during their  Lifetime  as  Spencer Mil∣ton Butler Otway  among ourselves and among the Ancients  Homer  while the most contemptible of all Scriblers have been Esteemed and Honoured Our Kings them∣selves have more than once had such vile Scriblers for  their Poets  and have like For∣tune taken a Pleasure in  exalting Fools  But tho' a King can give a Man Title and Place only GOD can give him  Genius  'Tis the Prerogative of a King to make a  Knight  but only GOD can make a  Poet  THE Reasons of the Difference which we sometimes find in the Fortunes of great  Poets  and  Painters  appear to me to be chiefly these which follow  The First is That the great Painter for each of his Masterpieces has but  one  Ori∣ginal and no  Copy  can come up to the easie Grace and the natural Force of a beau∣tiful  Original  whereas of masterly Poems there are as many Originals as there are true Copies and all of them have equal Force and equal Grace and Beauty and this is none of the least Things that render the Works of the Painter so precious and the Artist himself so fortunate A Man may buy the Works of  Homer  or  Virgil  for a very Trifle whereas those of  Raphael  are above any Value But this multiplying of Originals gives the great  Poet  at least one Ad∣vantage over the famous  Painter  which is that it renders what he writes perpetual  Homer  and  Virgil  are immortal in their  Works  but  Zeuxis  and  Apelles  are only so in their  Fame  ANOTHER Reason of this Difference is The Universality of the Language in which the Painter delivers his Art The great Painter speaks to all Countries as intelligibly as to his own nay more intelligibly more gracefully and more forcibly to those  Countries which are polite and therefore his Fame keeps equal Pace with his Merit and whereever he goes both Fortune and Fame attend him The more his Pieces are known the more they are desired and the more dearly purchased The greatest of Kings are ambitious to be Masters of them and ambitious to possess the  Painters  as well as their Works What modern Poet during his  Lifetime  was ever  read  by so many Sovereign Princes as were  drawn  by the Hand of  Titian  What Prince ever heap'd those Honours on a Poet that  Charles  the  Fifth  did on  Titian  Did the renowned  Augustus  himself with all his Capacity and all his Greatness of Mind so Honour  Ho∣race  or  Virgil  Now while the Painter's Fame and Fortune are unconfin'd those of the greatest of our  English  Poets are restrain∣ed to the Islands of  Great Britain  and  Ire∣land  that is to less than  Twenty Millions of People  of which perhaps there are hardly  Five hundred  which have a fine Taste of Poetry  ANOTHER Reason of the Difference in the Fortunes of great Painters and Poets with regard to Painting after the  Life  is the darling  Interest  and the darling  Passion  of both Sexes and especially of the Women no Motive is generally so predominant as that of SelfInterest no Passion so vehe∣ment and so ardent as SelfLove Now the Generality of both Sexes look upon their  Persons  as their  very selves  It is their  Persons then which they ardently desire should be advantageously known and fairly distinguished and should remain after them This the great  Painter  alone can perform who is sure to draw the best Like∣ness and yet at the same Time to distin∣guish a Face from all other Faces what∣ever which 'tis impossible that the greatest  Poet  in the World can ever do by  De∣scription  ANOTHER Reason of the foresaid Dif∣ference is That few Persons pretend to decide sovereignly in  Painting  but they who are acquainted with the Rules of the Art and who besides the Reading Ancient and Modern History understand  Geometry Perspective  and  Anatomy  whereas the Rab∣ble of Mankind pretending to judge of  Poetry  sovereignly and without Appeal wretched  Poetasters  have been often  applau∣ded  and  excellent Poets neglected  because the former write most to the  Capacity  of the  Rabble  And there is one Thing which I have formerly mentioned and which I have often observed and always with fresh Surprize That the Rabble by their Noise their Clamours and their Obstinacy have often drawn in Men who have pass'd for Men of Sense to affirm their unrighteous Decrees whereas the Men of Sense with all their Judgment and with all their Per∣severance have never been able to draw in the Rabble without the Assistance of  Time  THERE is still another Reason of the foresaid Difference in the Fortunes of great Poets and Painters which is this Most Men are very sensual and Pleasure of  Sense  af∣fects them more than Pleasure merely  In∣tellectual  They love to have their Under∣standings informed by their Senses because that Instruction gives them  Pleasure  with∣out any Mixture of Pain which always in some measure accompanies Labour and great Attention And of all the Senses they love chiefly to be instructed by the  Sight  because the Instruction that comes that Way is attended with the least  La∣bour  And if it be true that there are no  innate Ideas  if it be true that there is no∣thing in the Understanding but what was in the  external Sense before  then the Me∣thod of Instruction used by the  Painter  is the very Method wich  God  and  Nature  have taken to instruct us And this is the Cause of that extraordinary Pleasure which Men receive from  Painting  as  Aristotle  has ob∣served in the Fourth Chapter of his Art of  Poetry  And in this the  Painter  has in∣finitely the Advantage of the  Poet  The Painter informs the Understanding and warms the Imagination by striking the  Sight  strongly and giving it the Height of Pleasure while all that can be done of that kind by the greatest Poet that ever liv'd is to make us vainly  imagine  that he

Your most Humble Faithful Servant  A B  The Plain Dealer N  o    Labor Improbus omnia vincit  VIRG  Otium cum dignitate  CICERO  MONDAY  October    THERE is not a more delightful Way of conveying useful Knowledge into the Mind than Copying the  Allegories  of the  Ancients  The following Genealogy of LABOUR and PLEASURE is a modern Per∣formance of this kind which shews the Au∣thor a Person of lively Fancy and sound Judgment  IT was sent me in a wellwritten Letter subscribed  J F  which when I suppress I must own I give my self some Mortification  SATURN  the Son of COELUM after having made a Separation of Body and Goods with his Wife CYBELE married NECESSITY the Daughter of DESTINY and FORTUNE  Old Father DESTINY gave this poor Girl of his her Education among the  MUSES  and trained her up in the Company of  Poets  and  Philosophers  She was blessed from a very Child with a strong and enterprizing Genius quick and ready at Invention fruit∣ful of mighty Projects and ever intent upon proper Ways and Means to give a finishing Stroke to her Undertakings But though she was ingenious she was homely in her Person she poor Thing had none of those Charms to boast of which might draw the Eyes of Lovers upon her her  Mien  carried with it as little Temptation as her  Face  and her Fortune was  low  and still  less inviting  than  either  so that she was no Body's Taste and not any Individual breatheing had the least Thought of her for a  Wife  The  MUSES  found the Charge grow heavy upon Them and sensible of their Inability to go through with the Expence of keeping her much longer the begg'd DESTINY by all means to take her out of their Hands and think of making proper Provision for her in some other Way This put DESTINY on trying to bring about a Match between his Daughter and his old Friend SATURN whom he persuaded that since he was so far gone in Years and parted from his Wife without any Appearance of their coming together again it was not pos∣sible for him to do better than marry some honest careful Body who would be tender in looking after him And then he took Occa∣sion to name his own Daughter as a Person well qualified for that Office assuring the old Gentleman at the same Time of her Incli∣nations  to do every Thing that would be most pleasing in his Eyes  THE Truth is NECESSITY was a good toward Girl and followed her Father's Coun∣sel so well and behaved herself with so much Docility Humility and Diligence that she intirely won the old Man's Heart That which prevailed with him most of all to come to this Resolution arose from this Con∣sideration That all the Uneasiness between him and CYBELE was occasioned by her  too great  Riches which made her presumptuous enough to slight and despise him and use him so ill as to carry on a secret Affair with PLUTO a Commerce the most displeasing in Nature to him and which he could never forgive Hence he became perswaded it would be doing very wisely to marry a Wo∣man of Birth who having nothing of her own would think of no other Enjoyments but those which she shared in common with him which he knew to be sufficient to ren∣der her eternally happy  PRELIMINARIES were all settled the Treaty concluded and the Marriage con∣summated between old SATURN and his poor Spouse NECESSITY whose whole Portion consisted in her  Vigilance  her  Obedi∣ence  and  Humility  THE only  Issue  of this Marriage was VIR∣TUE who from her Cradle gave Promises of her Beauty As soon as she grew up the mature Virgin drew gazing Crowds after her  and the Eyes of the admiring World was fix'd upon this Object There was not that single God in  Olympus  but was fond of her Acquaintance However as she happened to be of a high and overruling Temper and would take the Liberty of telling People their Faults very plainly to their Faces she was not overwelcome to many where she went  THEN again her Mother NECESSITY whose Company she was seldom out of was by Nature bashful and little used to fre∣quent the Palaces of the  Great  She went always very  plainly  and  simply  cloathed after the  old Fashion  which made her not a little timorous of visiting the  modish  Gods of  Quality  THIS manner of Life becoming trouble∣some to them they went often to pay their Respects to the  MUSES  and to see the  Poets  and  Philosophers  their old Friends with whom they always found a more friendly and grateful Reception This made them think of returning to the  MUSES  and there to live for ever And this NECESSITY got her Husband to consent to who approved of this Retreat the more willingly because he very justly judged that the good Qualities of his Daughter VIRTUE might help a great deal in that Place towards correcting the Vices and reforming the Errors of Man∣kind  ACCORDINGLY they returned to  Parnas∣sus  and the  MUSES  obliged them with  fine Apartments where VIRTUE made herself known more and more and was ad∣mired by every Eye that could get a Sight of her The  MUSES  did all they could to exalt the Merit of their new Tenant they left nothing unsaid that might inlarge her Reputation they had a mighty Mind to captivate some suitable Person and engage his Affections to her But all in vain there was not one Ear  rightly  open to these repea∣ted Praises and Admonitions Whole Crowds indeed would throng to gaze at her every Spectator Admired her and even every Hearer when she spoke was forc'd to allow That she had Reason for the Reprimands she made but not one of them would have any Con∣cern with her or join themselves for ever with a Person whose Manner of Living was so extraordinary and uncommon  THUS she remained a long Time unpro∣vided for 'till a venerable Sort of Gentleman oldish but not very far in Years who had the Reputation of great Capacity Observa∣tion and Experience and whose Name was WISDOM happen'd to light upon her To him this  tart  Humour of hers which was always as  just  as it was  severe  was not at all distasteful On the contrary he liked her for it he made his Court to her and having addres∣sed her Father and Mother for their Consent and obtained it married her to the univer∣sal Joy of  Parnassus  THIS excellent Couple had Issue but One Child named LABOUR who in his Infancy gave them Trouble enough in all Conscience to rear him As soon as he approached the Age of Manhood he gave the most apparent Signs of a  working  Head and appeared never  easy  but when in  Action  ONE Day above the rest having closely employed himself upon an Undertaking of great Moment a Task which his Mother VIRTUE had been pleased to set him he saw RECOMPENCE the Daughter of MERIT and of REASON and became passionately in Love with her Her  Youth  was blooming her  Beauty  exquisitely charming her Humour powerfully bewitching her  whole Person  irre∣sistably ravishing All she  look'd  or  said  or  did  was so engaging that it was  natural  in her to  please  and there was nobody but loved her nobody but longed to possess her  LABOUR who was nearly touched with so many agreeable Qualities resolved with himself to do every thing that should be re∣quisite to gain her and as she did not want Lovers he judged he should meet with many Difficulties before he could attain his desired End But having received some joyful Assu∣rance that the Figure he made in the World did not displease her he resolved to omit nothing that might make him still more grateful in the Eye of his Mistress After infinite Pains innumerable Hopes and Dis∣appointments the Treaty was at length con∣cluded  with MERIT and REASON the Pa∣rents of RECOMPENCE who gave their Con∣sent with great Alacrity and the more for that VIRTUE herself did very heartily inte∣rest herself in that Affair Nay farthermore Advices came to the Parents of RECOMPENCE that the Marriage was APPROVED and DESIRED by COELUM the GreatGrandfather to LABOUR  IN Effect LABOUR and RECOMPENCE were so exactly matched that one may say they were born  one  for the  other  their Mar∣riage was perfectly happy by the good Un∣derstanding in which they lived For LABOUR continuing towards his Wife the same Affe∣ction desired to be everlastingly in her Com∣pany he could not bear her a Moment out of his Sight by his good Will and would scarce be persuaded at Times that he had seen her when he really had His Wife was no less fond on her Side she observed a Conduct so regular and so judicious that she never gave him Reason of Complaint and would favour nobody with her  Presence  where her Husband was  absent  THIS Marriage was render'd still more prosperous by its Fruitfulness For they had Issue Three Children Two Girls and a Boy The Boy who was the Youngest was called REST He was  well made  in his  Person agreeable insinuating welcome  where∣ever he went His noble Birth and engaging Qualities made him regarded and coveted  by  all  the World and chiefly by the  Rich  He was not of so high a Spirit as his Sisters He visited none but Persons that were peace∣ful and little enterprizing His  Father  was angry at it and did all he could to render him  more active  but he fled out of his Sight because continual solliciting him to do some∣thing disturbed his  Quiet  and interrupted his Beloved  Repose  THESE repeated Sollicitations grew at last so insupportable to REST that his Humour being no longer able to bear that of his  Father  which was so  opposite  he harbou∣red Malice against him and joining in an Association with IDLENESS with whom he had contracted a  strict Friendship  they plot∣ted together to take away the Life of the Parent of REST But honest Father LABOUR being vigilant was not long without disco∣vering this Conspiracy of which being but too certain he drove this  unnatural Son  from him nor would ever see him more REST touch'd with  Repentance  or pushed by  some other  Motive retired to the  Service of the Gods  where he has ever since taken up his Residence  THE Two Daughters of LABOUR were GLORY and PLEASURE both of them fine Persons intirely like their Mother so very like her that they were often taken for her which made her extreamly fond of them LABOUR loved them dearly too as well on Account of their Merit as for that  near Re∣semblance  of Features which made him re∣member when his Heart was first smitten with Love  THE Children on their Side dutifully answered this Affection and hardly ever quitted their  Father  and  Mother  whereever they went whether to  private People  or  Princes  where they  most  delighted to make their Abode and where they were  very wel∣come  being significant Persons in  War  and  Peace  and shining as well in the  Cabinet  as the  Field  IT is true that PLEASURE was not so lofty and proud of Heart as GLORY her Sister For whereas GLORY thought of no∣thing but  great  Things and would frequent none but People of great Genius despising all other Considerations PLEASURE on the contrary could amuse herself with any thing loving as well Business of  little Account  as that of  Importance  the People of a  midling  as well as of the  sublimest  Genius  low  as well as  high  Life caressing all alike which won her the Hearts of all the World As she was by Nature very  curious  she diver∣ted herself with making little particular Jour∣nies to People who were glad to have her in their Company provided she was not with her  Father  and her  Sister  the  Austerity  of whom put them under too great a Restraint  THESE little Sallies gave a  Stain  to her Reputation it not being possible to see so fine a Girl familiarly visit so many People  without speaking of it But what had like to have ruined her intirely was that at the same Time a  debauch'd Girl  who had some∣thing of the  Air  of PLEASURE but much  Affectation  took it in her Head to go by the  same  Name in order to find the  easier Access  in all Places She was the Daughter of LEISURE and DEBAUCH despicable People and as she had neither  Birth  nor  Honour  she mingled indifferently with  all Sorts  of Persons leading an infamous Life and so disorderly that she passed for one lost  THIS Identity of Names made them attribute to the  true  PLEASURE all the Disorders of the  false  which obliged her to clear up the Matter with her Father LABOUR who was deceived like the rest of the World by this Appearance But above all Things her  conscious Innocence  which they accused her to have violated gave her great Confidence in her own Justification She made known to her  Father  that the greatest Part of those she frequented were the best Friends of  Him  and his Ancestors VIRTUE and WISDOM That she was cherished by a  whole Sect  of  Philosophers  and in short That she saw  none  but People whose  Manners  were  Praiseworthy  The Plain Dealer No  Nos

more than when I can be personating the  good old Man  that is to say Acting the Part of a Father towards the Youth of either Sex must  naturally  have a singular Regard for those worthy Matrons my Cotemporaries whose approved Wisdom and Vertue induce pru∣dent Parents to consign Children to their  Guardianship  The Truth is That when∣ever I light upon the least Commerce with this beneficial Set of People I am willing to improve it both for their Sakes and my Own that we pick out of one another some∣times a lucky Hint that has been useful in conducting one Child to its Welfare and by pushing it in the Education of another make it the Happier its whole Life afterFor this Reason I was resolved to dispatch the  Request of the following Letter as early as possible and because as the careful Writer of it has young Ladies under her Tuition I not only consider Her as a common Corres∣pondent but have for Her that  fraternal  Re∣gard which is felt by an  Affectionate Brother  October  SIR  HAVING the Charge of two young La∣dies of Fortune lately devolved upon me I cannot but think it needful to call in the Assist∣stance of the  PLAIN DEALER  to en∣able me to perform this important Task with that Justice and Prudence which I am con∣vinc'd it requires  I therefore beg you will give me some Rules for Education and that they may the better Adapted to my present Necessity I must tell you as concisely as I can the different Dispositions I have to deal with  THE eldest is about Fifteen very Bookish but her chief Study has hitherto been in Roman∣ces and Novels I think it not proper to dis∣courage this Taste of Reading in her but would rather lead her insensibly into the Perusal of Books really Useful which to such a One ought to be entertaining too What they must be I submit to your Judgment who I hope will Recommend some Authors that may be safely put into their Hands  MY younger Charge not quite Fourteen is so far from reading Romances that I can fix her to nothing She promises fair to be the very  Counterpart of your  Patty Amble  And I believe has been a  Coquette  from her Cradle She is goodnatur'd but giddy and I fear it will be a difficult Matter to make her a reason∣able Woman tho' She certainly has good Sense  THIS will be no Paradox when we consi∣der how many People loose the Benefit of a fine Understanding for want of fixing it upon a pro∣per Basis  YOUR Thoughts upon this  SUBJECT  will be a Publick Benefit and a Particular Fa∣vour to  SIR  Your constant Reader and humble Servant ASPASIA  IT is Nobly and Generously observed by an Excellent Poet of the present Age that To  do one good Actio    is preferable to the  writing  however sublimely the most  Glori∣ous Deeds of others  But methinks on the other hand it gives an unspeakable Pleasure to deliver in  writing  what may give occasion to  good Actions  The honest Inclination of  Aspasia  and her earnest Desire That I would give her a Word of Advice concur to raise in me this Expectation and therefore while I shall lay down some cursory Observations which may be of Service to young People I am not asham'd to own That the little Entertainment which I offer to that Class of my Readers is a kind of Feast to my Self  ASPASIA  very well knows the first and most important Point which consists in studying their Tempers and the Bent of their Inclinations The Knowledge once ob∣tained the next Step is to improve and heighten their good Qualities and  artificially  to transform the Defects and Errors of their Nature into Graces and Ornaments As we must  naturally  Love those whom we desire to instruct and as it is  natural  not to love those who obtrude Instruction upon us but to listen with Attention to those whom we Love and to gather Instruction from them as it were  without their Knowledge  It is for these Reasons methinks Necessary that the Method generally observed in these Cases should be Reversed that is to say The  In∣struction  of the Child should be the  Conse∣quence  of a Tutress's  Love  towards it and not her  Love  be the  Consequence  of its  taking  her  Instructions  These Directresses of Youth should  begin  where they generally  end  They give their  Advices plainly  and  bluntly  and as those happen to take Root direct their  Affe∣ctions  or  Resentments  But they should  first  Practice upon the  Affections  of their  Wards  gain their Hearts and make their own  Love seen  and  afterwards  steal their Admonitions into them under the Covert of Art keeping them as much as possible  unseen  Instruction thus Politically couched will have a Power that is Irresistable and make an amazing Progress in tender Minds Advice not seen  by  will be sure to be seen  in  them  TO descend to Particulars in our present Case Looking over those Romances and Novels which her eldest  Ward  delights in too much  Aspasia  will certainly find some Heroick Examples of Vertue These she would relate to some Friend in the Secret with very great Applauses so as to be Over∣heard by her fair Pupil who will be prejudi∣ced for a Judgment that seems to favour her own and that she would be glad should do so She will be charmed to hear this and remaining as it were  perdue  listen greedily to it as the Commendation of her self When her Mind is thus strongly prejudiced in Be∣half of her Guardian when it is warmed and just ready to take the Impression then just then the Guardian has an Opportunity of pressing down the Seal of Vertue A lit∣tle proper Female Oratory in Commendati∣on of the like Passages still more beautifully expressed in such Books as she would have her read will make her long and beg of her own accord to see them As for Exam∣ple  Aspasia  might say Such a noble Qua∣lity is eminently conspicuous in the Hero of this Romance but then he appears defective in such other Points The Hero of such a Novel Revere for such a Part of his Con∣duct but he is greatly to blame in other Re∣spects The principal Character in such a Book of Memoirs would be a Favourite and a shining Character but for such and such Blemishes and Imperfections Such a Gal∣lant  in such a Play behaves himself well throughout the whole Action and makes me love him at my very Heart but such a Gal∣lant has a villainous Design at Bottom up∣on his Mistress's Honour and is my mortal Aversion After having thus remark'd up∣on Texts out of the Lady's own Scripture it is Inexpressible what an Effect it might have if growing into a sudden Rapture  Aspasia  should go on as follows How does it charm and transport one to find all these Vertues and none of the opposite Vices all these Beauties without Deformities united in that one Favourite Character of mine the  Chri∣stian Hero  described with all the Force with which Vertue can be described and painted with all the Beauties with which Beauty can be paintedThis Method or such a Me∣thod as this would prompt the listening  bookish  Ward to a Desire of seeing that Tract she would long for it she would enquire af∣ter it she would beg to read it she would set to reading it already prejudiced in its Fa∣vour It would gain upon her in the Read∣ing till she gained what her Guardian would wish from reading it As she has true Taste this just Picture would beget in her a Con∣tempt of those coarse Daubings of a Nove∣list's grosser Hand The same may be said of the  Heroines  celebrated in her favourite Romances How much more charmingly is the  fine Lady  described in the Marquess of  Hallifax  his Advice to a Daughter and so of  othersWhat Fruit may not be hoped and expectedReading that little Book called  The Advice to a Daughter  and the  Lady's Li∣brary  is enough to make young Women learn to  Know themselves  STEELE  's Christian Heroe  and the  Gentleman Instructed  teach them abundantly to know Men A  Know∣ledge  of  themselves  will be the  Preservative  of their  Honour  and a  true Knowledge  of  Men  will fortifie them against the  Treacheries  that are used by  artful  Deceivers of  that Sex  which is almost sure one Time or other to be either  their RUIN  or  their ORNA∣MENT  N B  There not being Room in this  Paper  some Hints upon  Education  shall be occasionally added wherein  ASPASIA  's  Elder Charge  shall be further considered not forgetting the  Younger  who may be a  fine Woman bred  notwithstand∣ing she is  born  a COQUET  The Plain Dealer N  o    Aliena Negotia Centum  Per caput circumsaliunt latus  HOR  MONDAY  October    I INTENDED in this PAPER to have proceeded upon some Hints concerning EDUCATION But I am forced to break off the Thread and defer it to another Day I have many entertaining  LETTERS  by me from  Edinburgh  and  Bath  and two that I must particularly mention from  CoventGar∣den  with Relation to my late Discourse on the  PlayHouse Management  One is written by Mr  Sock  in a sad and  lamentable  Stile and the other by Mr  Buskin  filled with such Heroick  Rants  that however they excite no  Terror  will as well answer the  End  of being exhibited to publick View and move  Diver∣sion  like some  Modern Tragedies  With all these I should be glad to oblige the  Publick  as soon as possible but the following EPISTLE seems intended to Redress in some Measure an injured Person and I think it a Part of Duty to quit other Speculations though  never so inviting where it lies in my Power to  assist  towards rescuing an honest Man out of  real  or even  imaginary  Distress since the  latter  is often  equally  painful with the  former  To the  PLAIN DEALER  SIR  IN One of your PAPERS concerning DETRACTION you justly observed That Persons guilty of it in a great  City  ought to have some  Distinguishing Signs  to discover them as Crosses are placed on the Doors of the  Diseased  in the Time of a Pestilence  THAT happy Way of Reasoning in∣seperable from Truth which shines in all your Writings on whatsoever  Subject  em∣ployed carries Conviction in every Line that gives the  Good Man  Pleasure and the  Envious  and  Detracting  Pain  THEN to whom shall I apply for Re∣dress but to the PLAIN DEALER who tho' above flattering the Great thinks it not unworthy him to do Justice even to the  Lowest  Degree of Merit  WAS I to draw the Man I mean in the Character of  Husband Father  or  Friend  in each he would please and satisfy but as those distinguishing Characters are Private tho' Undisputed I will beg leave to tell you He has in  Active  Life a  Fame  that  gives Uneasiness to some malignant People while it does Good more widely than they wou'd wish him able to extend it  IF an indefatigable Industry with his allowed  Skill  and  Humanity  crowned by the Blessing of the  ALMIGHTY  with uninterrupted Success can recommend a Man to Esteem in the useful Profession of of  Surgery  you will allow me to name Mr  Coltheart  Methinks I see him as I have often seen him going to the Relief of some miserable Object with his usual Chearfulness and Smiles with that Regard however to the Cause which the Greatest could wish for the Unhappy seldom find as if he was going to some Great Man whose Cure must make his Fortune tho' he is certain to have no other Recompence than the Thanks and Prayers of his un∣friended Patient  INNUMERABLE Instances of this Kind the Grateful Many he has served wou'd give who tho' willing are not allow'd to do him the Justice he deserves which in∣duces me to believe if ever Man took Pleasure in doing Good he does as also to think him a proper Subject and Excuse for my troubling you with this who am  SIR  Your most Obedient Humble Servant  Z Y  WHEN I reflect upon the many Advan∣tages arising to Mankind from the Skill of a True Professor of the Surgeon's Art he ap∣pears so Useful a Member of the CommonWealth that he makes no  inconsiderable  Fi∣gure among the most  considerable  like  Ma∣chaon  among the Heroes in  Homer  The Per∣son this Letter relates to far from meriting to be spoken ill of deserves that respect which the best of all Books requires to be paid to the Physician if it was for nothing else but having not long since preserved the Life of a Member of a very noble Fa∣mily in which  Wisdom  and  Eloquence  have been a long Time  Hereditary  AS I am brought once more unwill∣ingly to touch upon that hated Subject  DETRACTION  I think I cannot do better in order to deter People from it than to place before their Eyes a Picture of its Defor∣mity as it was drawn by that Great Master  APELLES  and Described by an excellent old Author  AT the RightHand was drawn Sit∣ting a Man with long Ears put∣ting forth his Hand to  DETRACTION  who seem'd from afar off to come towards him About this Man stood two Women that is to say  IGNORANCE  and  SUSPICION  On the other side came  DETRACTION  a Woman dress'd in great Pomp and Magnificence but in a  mighty Passion of Anger having her As∣pect like Fire In her LeftHand she held a burning Torch and with her other she drew by the Hair of his Head a young Man who held up his Hands to∣wards Heaven calling God to Witness his Innocence With Her came a Woman Pale and Evilfavoured beholding the the young Man attentively like one that had been consumed with long Sickness whom you might easily conjecture to be  ENVY  THERE followed two other Women who made it their Business to adorn  DETRACTION  One was  TREASON  the other  FRAUD  After followed a Woman in Mourning Black and Ragged called  REPENTANCE  who turning her Back and sore ashamed beheld  TRUTH  who then came forward  IT is thus  APELLES  described  DE∣TRACTION  by which he himself was brought into extream Danger having been falsely accused to King  Ptolomy  of  Egypt  who upon his refuting the Accusation or∣dered him as many Talents as would amount to Twelve Thousand Pounds Sterling and that his Accuser should be his perpetual Bondsman  IF some curious Engraver would form a Plate upon this Model the best Method would be for Persons this way Injured to  purchase a Ptint and fix it like a PlayBill at the Door of any noted Offender after which it should be a Rule for the Neigh∣bourhood never to believe a Report that came from that Quarter whether in  Praise  or  Dispraise  of any Body  BY this Means the  TONGUES  of  EvilSpeakers  and the  PENS  of  EvilWriters  would become  Useless  and  Unregarded  and Innocence having nothing to fear might

long Room my  SNUBSY  took a Fancy to let her Kins∣woman  woman see how fine a Skill she was Mistress of In order to which she fell to reading us a  Lecture  over the Palm of a silent  Lunatic  who with a Rugg about his Shoulders ve∣ry quietly gave her his Hand through the  Grate  he was standing atShe had just pointed out How his  Mons Mercurii  be∣came afflicted by an Evilline from his  Mons Lunae  when the Patient besprinkled her Face with a Bowlfull of a certain Illscented Liquor of his own making which his other Hand had concealed behind him We were all in good Measure made Par∣takers of his Bounty But my Cousin and I were beginning to quit some Part of it which we thought we should have no Use for when we were interrupted by our dripping  Chiromancer  who ran between us all in Transport holding her Hands as high as our Eyes and crying out with great Ve∣hemence That  Her Fears were now over  For she had foreseen by a  CombustLine  between her  Pollex  and her  Cardiac  That she should be in Danger of a Violent Death either by  Drowning  or  Suffocation  IT is not in my Power to explain to you All the Benefits which I receive from this Profoundness of my Spouse's  Foresight  Other People when they take  New Servants  are forc'd to send and enquire their  Cha∣racter  But my little Conjurer does but peep upon their Palms and satisfies her self immediatelyI had a very strong Parti∣ality  for a smiling Country Girl that came last Week to offer her Service in the Qua∣lity of a  ChamberMaid  But upon the very first Inspection my Examiner charg'd her Home With  Three Favourite Sweethearts  and then whispered something in her Ear which she staid not to return an Answer to but ran blushing out of Doors in the ut∣most Hurry and Disorder And this  Disco∣very  my  Cassandra  assured me was ground∣ed meerly upon  Palmistry  the Girl having a manifest  Triangle  on the Bottom of the  Mount  of  Venus  which extended so far downward as to make a  Cleft  in her  Re∣stricta  I WAS once in some kind of Danger to have been drawn into a  Plot  but my  SNUBSY  found it out in the Palm of my Hand and in Presence of a  Minister of State  who I can assure You made no small Use of Her convinc'd me beyond Dispute that I should bid fair for being  hang'd  by Virtue of a  crooked Line that cross'd my  Via Combusta This frighted me from my foolish Purpose But I re∣member I was strangely comforted to dis∣cover at the same Time upon the  Mini∣ster's  opening his Hand too That his Lord∣ship had a  Combusta  as  dangerously mark'd  as mine was  AFTER so happy a Deliverance by In∣terposition of Her Art I grew desirous to be  taught  it and with a great Deal of Good  Success I got over the Heathen Names of her  Planets  and knew what Parts of her Hand they  kept House  in I was wonderfully pleased with  VENUS  when I found in my  Primmer of Palmestry  That she signi∣fied  Womankind Kisses  and  Ladies Curiosi∣ties  But I could never away with  MER∣CURY  For her  Books  were pleas'd to in∣form me That he held his Influence over  Pages Pimps  and  Lawyers Justices of the Peace  and  Astrologers  I thought it from that Time forward unbecoming my Ho∣nour and Gravity to apply my self to an Art that had treated my Office with such Indignity And as often as I cast my Eye upon these Venerable Words  Justice of the Peace  and saw them mix'd with such Ill Company I clos'd my Fist in a Fury and would study  Palmistry  no longer  YET in the Way my  SNUBSY  pra∣ctices Truth compells me to confess It is an inexhaustable Fund of Benefits both to my Self and to the PublickIf I happen to be sick she consults  not  my  Pulse  but my  Palm  And when Persons of less Learning feel Change of Weather in their  Toes  she reads it under her  Fingers  In short it is impossible for any Body but One who knows as much of her as I do to imagine what strange Sings and Tokens she carries about her and what Great Things they signifie  To such a powerful Pitch of Perfection has she rais'd her surprizing Skill that she saved a poor Man's Life lately who was brought before me by a Neighbour's Daughter in Order to charge him upon Oath With having done no less than  ra∣vish'd  her But  SNUBSY  who was for beginning the Examination in her own Way no sooner saw the Inside of their Hands than she convinced the Sufferer very seasonably That the Accident was  un∣avoidable  having been foretokened by a plain  Incisure  on the Center of her  Via La∣ctea  So that being  decreed  from Both their Births this Misfortune became a  Fate  and it would have been in vain to have strug∣gled against itThe poor Girl wept and thanked her and with charitable Change of Purpose told the Prisoner That  she for∣gave him heartily for she thought it Hard To have a Man hanged for doing Nothing but what he was  born  for  IN Justice to the Merit of a Wife so deeply learn'd I could do less than desire you to acquaint the World with my  SNUBSY  's  Character  when you come to lay open the  Genius  of our  English Ladies  I am with due Regard  SIR  Your neverfailing  Reader  And your humble  Servant WALTER WORSHIPFUL  The Plain Dealer N  o    Per varios Casus per tot Discrimina Rerum  Tendimus  VIRG  MONDAY  November    To the  PLAIN DEALER  Edinburgh  October    SIR  IN my Last I laid before You a short Character of the present Magistrates of this  City  and some Account of the Fac∣tious Spirit that too often disturbs Them and their Laudable Undertakings I am not at all surpriz'd to hear That many of your  Readers  among my own  Country∣men  have taken Offence at my Free Cor∣respondence notwithstanding the Sanction of  your  Judgment under which it is published  PREJUDICE will always make the World Uneasie Whatever Cause it pro∣ceeds from it never fails to govern the Understanding in a very shameful Man∣ner And tho' it is often no more than the imbib'd Sense of a second Person which a Man makes use of as his own it  is rarely and with great Difficulty re∣strain'd from producing innumerable bad Consequences in Life with the Face and Appearance of something that is Good it mixes it self with every Circumstance and Action and has every where a powerful Influence One Man calls it  Religion  ano∣ther  Principle  and he who dares be Blunt owns it by its plain Name of  Party  What∣ever is done or said upon this Founda∣tion though never so Faulty shall find  Advocates  and however Praiseworthy  Condemnation  What a Shame is it to Rea∣son to hear it avow'd That such a Sett of Men can do Nothing  Ill  because  on our Side  And such another Nothing  Well  because  they Vote with our Enemies  But Enough of this SubjectIf as 'tis ge∣nerally own'd The Publick Good should be the Point most in View of each Indi∣vidual I ought to rest satisfied and may despise the Spleen of my Censurers  BUT Sir I am inclined to construe fa∣vourably and perhaps the Indignation that some People express against good Per∣sons and good Things is not so much the Effect of  Vice  as of  Ignorance  As when a  Scheme  is proposed for Publick Benefit  Blockheads  may innocently decry it because they cannot comprehend it This I take to be the present Case from the dull Op∣position that I have wonder'd to see made against several highly generous and profi∣table  Undertakings Men whose Souls are shortsighted love to walk in Old  Ways  because they are in no Danger of being  lost  while they have a Hedge at each Elbow Thus the  Hotentots  adhere to their Hereditary Dirt and Nakedness Thus the  Irish  too were formerly instiga∣ted to  rebel against the Yoke  in Defence of their ancient Privilege of  drawing Ploughs by their Horses Tails  with all the  Wit  of a  freeborn  Stedfastness And I am sorry I have Cause to say That for a Reason of this goodly Sort my  Neighbours  love stink∣ing Streets and hate the Innovation of  Necessary Houses  IF in this Part of the World we chance to hear of a  Project to make us Cleanly  we wonder at the  crackbrain'd Whimsie  and guard our Hearts against  Vanity  If it is undertaken at the particular Expence of the Proposer we discourage the Guilt of so presuming a Generosity Nay let a Thing be actually executed and compleatly done to our Hands we have still Spirit enough to  rail  at it with the most mascu∣line Inflexiblity In this and other Re∣spects I have Instances in my  View  and my  Neighbours  will take my  Meaning  tho' not my  Counsel  IT were easie SIR to expatiate upon the  Ignorance  and  Partiality  that prevail among our People were I inclined to write  Satyr  and expose the Weakness of my  Countrymen But as I am unwilling to spread their Defects I beg Leave on the the other Side to lay before you several more of the Blessings and Ornaments our  City  boasts of  YOU have done us the Honour to di∣stinguish the Genius and Virtue of some of the rising  Generation  in one of your PAPERS and my last begins an Account of the FAIR ASSEMBLY here in  Edinburgh  which not∣withstanding the Opposition of our  Clergy  is one of the best  Nurseries  of  Politeness  in  SCOTLAND  By Means thereof our Youth of both  Sexes  learn a Habit of Briskness and Freedom which till of late were less frequent among us That Re∣straint and Stiffness of Air and Address which distinguished us from People of more generous Education by Decrees wears away and Conversation which was formerly so confin'd and so dull grows open free and easie  Ladies  find they may  speak  to  Gentlemen  without Violence to their  Mo∣desty  and  Gentlemen  may  entertain Ladies  without Designs upon their  Virtue  It is now no more a  Sight  when a Lover waits on his Mistress Home or takes a Walk with her in a Garden Nay we have Husbands who without Jealousie can hear Batche∣lours invite their Wives to an Entertain∣ment In short we exchange the  Spanish  Affectation and Gravity for the  English  Liberty and Free Spirit and in Place of  Narrow Minds  and the  vilest Hypocrisie  we are growing Profane enough to assert the  Dignity  of  Humane Reason  and the  Inno∣cent Privileges  of  Nature  PERHAPS I am not mistaken when I affirm That this  Conversion  I beg Leave of the  Clergy  to make Bold with the Word because I have as Good a Title to it as they have is in a great Measure the Effect of the  Union  of the Two Kingdoms But when I consider it is an Advantage I wou'd not be thought to mean that  either  Nation is yet too Happy under the Effects of their  Incorporation  It may be allow'd us I presume to wish that however strictly they are united they may never be bound so close but that one Hand may be loose enough to assist and unite the other if it is not quite  impossible  there shou'd arise in some future Age such a Miracle as a  Cor∣rupt Ministry  or a Prince less watchful than our present Glorious SOVEREIGN for the Defence of his Peoples Liberties  BUT I am no Politician nor will I at∣tempt to Enlarge upon a Subject that fits not the Purpose of your PAPER though I promise my self That the PLAIN DEALER will not scruple when Occasions rise to assert the  Rights  as well as the  Sense  of a  True Briton  I PROCEED to Remark That as the Correspondence and Communication between the now United Kingdoms has in a great  Measure improv'd and polish'd the  Taste  the  Air  and the  Fashions  of both the Gentle∣men and Ladies of my Country so it has also refin'd our Language in a very sensible Manner I do not mean the  Accent  and  Pronunciation  when we  speak  itFor these are hardly to be naturaliz'd without much Time and continual Converse there being in  England  itself a  Shibboleth  peculiar to every County No wonder then that  Scots∣men  find it difficult to come up to their Standard  BUT if you'll allow that we make some Progress in the  Substance  of the Lan∣guage we will readily give up our Preten∣sions to the  Graces  of it Yet our way of pronouncing the  Vowels  has Advocates in  Foreign  Countries And perhaps the Autho∣rity might deserve a Review with the  English  I have wonder'd to say Truth that we are such Proficients in the Language con∣sidering we have neither a  Court  nor a  Thea∣tre  which are the acknowledged  Fountains  of its Refinement  WHEN I look into the Writings of Mr  DRUMMOND  of  Hathornden  in the Reign of King  JAMES  I Sir  GEORGE MACKENZIE  in the Reign of King  CHARLES  II The Earl of  LAU∣DERDALE  in the Reign of King  JAMES  II Bishop  BURNET  and Mr  FLETCHER  of  Salton  in the two last Reigns and of a certain noted Wri∣ter  in the present when I compare their Style with the Style of some of their Co∣temporaries in  England  I am tempted to think my Countrymen not so very far inferiour as that  Criticks  shou'd depreciate our Pretensions to the Language But when I consider too That whatever Ele∣gance or Mastery of that Sort we arrive at is as much a  Virtue  in us as 'tis  Nature  in You I am vain enough to imagine that we merit no less Praise at least shou'd meet with fair  Indulgence  ONE Thing more I beg leave to Re∣mark with Respect to our Language Many of our Words that seem  Uncouth  and are not understood by  Englishmen  are notwithstanding of  English  Origin and are not less  Emphatical  and  Worthy  for being  Obsolete  among You I find few old Words in  DOUGLAS  's  VIRGIL  that are not also to be found in  CHAUCER  And perhaps our  ALLAN RAM∣SAY  a living  Versifier  in OldStyle uses few that are not to be met with in  SHAKESPEAR SPENCER  cexcept when he coins Words by vir∣tue of his  extrajudicial  Poetick Privileges that never were and never will be used by any Mortal besides  Himself  LIVING Languages are like living Trees they have their Summer and their Winter The  Words  of the One like the  Leaves  of the Other fall off and are suc∣ceeded  by a new Generation It is how∣ever Discretion's Work in this Case to Naturalize none at the Expence of better  YOU see Sir with what Freedom I write my Sense both of  Persons  and  Things  to you I own I observe no Order in the Form of my  Letters  Nor do I believe  That  wou'd recommend me more to your Regard What I chiefly aim at is A na∣tural  Simplicity  in my Expressions and a  Truth  in my Facts becoming a Correspon∣dent of the  PLAIN DEALER  'I HAVE the Honour to be with due Ve∣neration  SIR  Your trusty Intelligencer and most Obedient Servant  FERGUS BRUCE  AFTER having thank'd my Correspondent for the Continuance of his agreeable Intelli∣gence I shall close with a short Remark on on what he says concerning our Language  I AGREE with Him entirely that many of of our old Words had the same  Original  with theirs for all that Part of  Scotland  to the the Southward of the  Frith  was as much  Saxon  as we were So then the Foundation of our Language being the same it is not so reasonable as I wish it were to allow this ingenious Gentleman the Claim he makes in  Behalf of his CountryThat the Elegance and Mastery which are by  Nature  in Us are a  Virtue  in  North Britain  THE  Nature  is certainly alike to both Na∣tions The  Virtue  is most due where the Im∣provement was  first  made The  Nobility  and  Gentry  of  Scotland  have at least for Ages past been as learned as the  English  and much more accustom'd to foreign Travel and Corre∣spondence These are the great and indeed the only Causes of Refinement in a Lan∣guageFor  Trade  and  Luxury  are much more likely to corrupt it by the Confusion they introduce mixing Degrees and Distin∣ctions and contracting our Care to regard no∣thing so much as  INTEREST  SINCE then the  Scotch  Language was once the very same with the  English  and since their People have been more intimately Con∣versant than ours among Foreign Nations and have always enjoy'd the same Assistance of Learning and yet have been behind us in the Improvement of our common Tongue it follows by Necessity That the Praise of  Virtue  is in oursBut it is a  Birthright  which like  Kentish GavelKind  we must equally divide with our Brothers in the next Generation for tho' they were slow Setters out they have prov'd Themselves as good Runners and will be abreast with us in the Race and lose no Ground for the Future  The Plain Dealer N  o    Credula res amor est  OVID MET  Tormentis gaudet Amantis  JUV  FRIDAY  November    THE Complaint of  AMANDA  in the following LETTER is of a Na∣ture as New as the Foundation of it is Just The Guilt which it speaks of is frequent enough But this finespirited and discerning Lady has placed it on the Person who has hitherto been look'd on as most Innocent and deserving PityThe Truth is there are a thousand Resemblances of  Virtue  which if unmasq'd by so distinguishing a Hand as  AMANDA  's wou'd assume their proper Faces and be known for  Vices  and  Follies  I will entertain my Readers with this Lady's Excellent LETTER just as I receiv'd it and afterward in Obedience to her Command consider the Complaint which is the SUBJECT of it  October    SIR  WHEN Parents have so much Zeal for their Childrens  Promotion  and so little for their  Happiness  as to force them to  Marry  the Person they have an  Aversion  to How is the World mov'd with a Ten∣derness of Concern And Nature shock'd with the Violence  SUCH a Constraint has always met with its just Discouragement And your  Predeces∣sor in  PLAIN DEALING took it under his Care But Whether it is from the  Pride  of  one Sex  who are fond of the  Reputation  even of a Lover whom they  Hate  Or from the un∣just  Partiality  of the  Other  The much greater Offender in my Opinion passes uncensuredSuch  Parents  are stigma∣tiz'd with  Inhumanity  and well they may But what shall we say of  Him  who con∣tinues to  teize  the Woman who  abhors  him who wou'd force her to make a  Pro∣stitute  of her  Love  To enslave herself to Interest And when her Refusal has drawn down the Resentment of her Parents lays it all on his  Excess of Love  IS Love then so  base  a Passion So void of Tenderness So unlike itself and all its generous Pretences that it can feed on the  Quiet  of the beloved Object and  steal from it  the Joy which it has not Power to  give it  No no The real Lover knows not how to  Offend  His Happiness  must rise and fall with  Hers  who in∣spir'd his PassionBut if on the contrary His Desires run  Counter  to her Happiness It is not  Love  It is  Brutality  And if He who is thus  possess'd  supposes Himself in Love He is deceiv'd and wou'd deceive Others  BUT even granting All This were the real Effect of Love on the Part of the Pursuer where can a  Woman  find That de∣delightful Harmony That inexhaustible Spring of Bliss which we are taught to ex∣pect in  Loving  Can the Constancy of an unlov'd Lover ever win her to a Compli∣ance Norather  Prepossession  will guard the Passes of her Heart nor suffer it to be brib'd by Obligations And  Time  does but add to our Hatred For Opportunity finds out Faults and furnishes  Reasons  for our RefusalIn short such a Lover shows more  Extravagance  than  Constancy  more  Inhumanity  than  Passion  THIS Sir is  my own  Misfortune to be miserably haunted by the Man whose Sight is Odious to me One whom no Words can convince No Denials satisfie No affronts affect Insensible of my Un∣easiness and Indefatigable in creating itI wou'd fly him but I cannot un∣less I wou'd fly my Friends too and my Parents Nor have I any  Intimate  left whom his Diligence and Insinuations have not made his Own  'TIS of YOU therefore I must beg to say something that may give me Ease and have some Effect on my troublesome Pursuer And if in any Thing I have said I am Mistaken in my Sentiments or unguarded in my Expressions be pleas'd to Correct it and think That a Woman can't be always on her Guard who has so just a Cause for Resentment as  Your Unfortunate Humble Servant  AMANDA  IT the Admiration which is due to such a Merit as this Lady's did not place her above Pity I cou'd be sorry for that Persecution which she Laments in so  Elegant  and  Pathe∣tic  a Manner The Gentleman who is so unhappy as to be the Subject of her Com∣plaint will be the last that feels the Force of itThere is a  Love of ourselves  deeply rooted in human Nature that imposes on us first and then emboldens us to impose on Others We do not  approve  the Faults which we are guilty of But which is almost as bad we  cannot see  themWe join hear∣tily in with those who condemn the very Follies which are most remarkably  our own  and are all the while insensible how ridicu∣lous we appear to Others by adhering pub∣lickly  to the  Practice  of what we as pub∣lickly continue to  Censure  IT is I must confess the hardest Lesson of Nature to correct the Extravagancies of  Love  Where this Passion is Real It will be the  Sovereign  of the Mind It moulds the Soul to its own Purposes and lends its own Eyes to the Understanding Neither does it depend for its Violence or Moderation on the Capacity of the Lover but on the Pro∣portion in which it actuates him The Wise Man in this Case has no Prerogative above the Fool It is in  Love  as it in  Madness  The more Exalted the  Genius  the more un∣bounded the  Raging  A Wise Man may much better  defend  himself than a Fool can But when He  yields  there is no Difference because  Opinion  in this Passion always stands in the Place of  Reason  THIS being the Case  AMANDA  has small Encouragement who by appealing to what is  Reasonable  would disswade her Lover from what is  Necessary  Her Charms have deprived his Life of every Comfort but what  She  gives it and while He loves at the Rate she says he does it will be im∣possible for him to  think  himself so much in the Wrong as she finds him  IT would certainly be a Great Happi∣ness if Men who love without Hope could desist without Misery For besides that  AMANDA  's Argument has thrown an Air of ungenerous Selfishness on the  Obsti∣nacy  of such Addresses there is This further Mischief in it That a Lover whom an avowed  Hatred  cannot repulse in his Appli∣cation cuts off his Right when he becomes a  Husband  to complain of or return  Ill Usage  Is she too Cold too Unkind too Disdainful for a  Wife  How much grea∣ter is His Fault who  foresaw  all This and yet would  make her one  He  loved  Her before She  pitied  Him and consented to be∣come  His  notwithstanding the most open  Profession  of her Insensibility And how Base and Ungenerous must it be To make the  Continuance  of that Insensibility his Pre∣tence for treating her Ill after she has put her self under his Protection which while she refus'd and detested him had no Power to move his Resentment  EITHER He ought with a manly Forti∣tude to  tear  himself from the Remembrance of an Object so insensible of his Torments or in Gratitude for a Compliance that was Involuntary and the Effect rather of Compassion than of Love He should re∣solve to support himself under the Misfortune of her Aversion without permitting his own Sentiments to be imbittered by the Effects of it till by a Progress of perswasive Soft∣ness He shall have touched her reluctant Heart and prepared it to receive Impressions as well of  Love  as of  Gratitude  BUT how Monstrous is the Brutal Figure which I have seen some  Husbands  make  who when  Lovers  were the Poorest and most Abject of all  Slaves  When they should be  Defenders  they are  Tyrants  and when it was reasonable for them to have been  Provoked  they were  stupidly Submissive  How contemptible is their unmanly Weak∣ness A morose and restless  Peevishness  makes up the Behaviour they expect to  charm by  They contract a surly sower Habit from the Disappointments they meet in Life and instead of softening the Edge of Afflicti∣on toward the Woman who is bound to share their Sufferings they double them on  her Head  from whom in Honour and Hu∣manity they ought to ward off Sorrow by a noble Sweetness and endearing Tenderness in their whole Behaviour  BUT the pleasantest Stupidity of all is That when by a Length of Savage Cruel∣ties they have made themselves compleatly Odious they are impudent enough to  won∣der How it happens that their Wives appear no fonder of them  THERE is no Part of our Life that requires a nicer Conduct than our Choice of the Per∣son with whom we are to  vow an inseperable Union  and yet there is Nothing which we venture on with more Rashness or which we examine with so little ForesightAnd hence it is That  MATRIMONY  with equal Satyr and Justice has been com∣pared by one of our Old Poets To a  Crowd  in the  Street  which excites a Curiosity in  every  Passerby  to add one Fool to the Number But they are no sooner in the midst of the Press than they grow uneasy at their Situation and are as Eager to elbow out again as they were before to gain Ad∣mission  MARRIAGE  is like unto a  RabbleRout  They that are  OUT  would fain get  IN  And They that are  IN  would fain get  OUT  MANY are the  Pleasantries  which the Truth and Frequency of this unlucky Ob∣servation have given Occasion to among  Men of Wit  who having laugh'd a while at Others grow silly enough themselves to be also laughed at in their TurnsBut in all the Multitude of Sarcastick Fancies which I have met with upon this  beaten  Subject I remember none that is so uncommon and founded on so humorous a Piece of Extrava∣gance as an EPITAPH which I saw at  Rome  where a Man and his Wife who were buried together are represented quar∣relling in their GraveThe Original is in  Latin  but I will translate it for the Service of  Coquets  and  Old Maids  who cannot fail to make Good Use of it on a THEME which they delight in handling  STAY  Batchelor  if you have Wit  A  Wonder  to behold  Husband  and  Wife  in One dark Pit

this Time I suppose I pass for an  OutoftheWay Old Humourist  who has No∣thing in him but a few  odd Whimsies  which he takes Delight to be noted for But now the  Town  begins to  fill  I design to take  more  State  upon me And before the  Winter  is half out I shall cause it to appear  pretty Plainly  That I can make free with  Trade  and  Poli∣ticks  as well as with  Wit  and  Impertinence  I WAS walking the other Day near the  Royal Exchange  and took up a little  Pamphlet  that lay in my Way at a Bookseller's Shop Intituled  New and Accurate Observations on the Coast of GUINEA  I was pleas'd with this Subject For tho' I inform'd my  Reader  my first setting out That I was an  Enemy to the EastIndia Company  by which hangs a  Secret  that may be disclos'd in some future Paper yet I am a  Lover of THE ROYAL AFRICAN  And have good  Reasons  for  both Opinions  THE Gentleman who is Author of the abovemention'd  Treatise  is a  Physician  new∣ly return'd from the  Coast  he writes ofHe seems to be a Person of  Learning  and  Experi∣ence  and expresses himself with a Warmth of  Spirit  that carries in it a Generous  Plainness  and a rough but Manly  Integrity  When I began to peruse his  Book  I thought He ap∣pear'd too  Angry  But before I had read it out the  ill Usage  He complains of seem'd incapable of being remember'd without an Agitation of such Passions as must leave him fully acquittedThe  Abuses  and  Misma∣nagements  which this Gentleman enumerates are such as I am sorry to hear of because their  Consequences  must affect the  Company  in too sensible a  Manner  I HAVE often reflected not without the utmost Amazement from what strange  Cau∣ses  it shou'd happen That the  Credit  of  that Company  has been sunk to so low an  Ebb  since nothing can be more demonstrable than that It has  Advantages  beyond Comparison above all others to make it self the most  Flourishing  If any Deficience within themselves with Regard to  Stock  or  Encou∣ragement  is the Prevention of their  Good Pur∣poses  methinks their  Complaints  cou'd be no sooner heard than they wou'd be sure of a  Remedy  For even as they now stand no  Company  exists that is of such  Importance  to the  Nation  If the Interest of  England  in Respect to  Trade  depends most as it certain∣ly does upon her  American Plantations  those Plantations do as certainly depend on the  SlaveTrade  from  AFRICA  A  Trade  that strengthens us in the very Vitals and first Principle of  Government  For it is perpe∣tually adding Encrease to the Numbers of our useful People far beyond the progressive  Growth  of our  slow  and  Natural Multipli∣cation  THE  Nation  too in Point of  Wealth  as well as  Power  is to an infinite Degree more advantag'd than  The Company  by Effect of this  Negro Traffick  When the  Company  have sold a  Slave  That Profit which they once make is  All  the  Benefit  which he can ever bring themBut for the Benefit of the  Nation  there is no computing what may be  gain'd by him Not only the Wretch him∣self but his Children's Children after him down to the latest Generations are for ever doom'd to  Work  and  All  their Product is the  Nation's  The Difference is Vast and Infinite  THE Extent of Country comprehend∣ed within the Limits of  This Company's Char∣ter  is Prodigious and Astonishing For above  Thirty Degrees  on one Side from the  Line  and about  Twenty  from the other all the  Coast  is within their Limits So that they have all the  Good  Variety of Soils and of Latitude which the  whole World  can afford themThey have consequently within their Bounds a proper Earth and Climate for every rich Product that we pick up here and there at the remotest Distances from one Side of the  Globe  to the otherThey have not it is true a Claim of Property to the  Lands  But how easily might they purchase it as far as cou'd be necessary at Rates too inconsi∣derable to deserve the namingThey have Islands too and Settlements never subject to the Natives InsultsWhy might not these be cultivated Why not  Rice Sugar Indigo Cotton Ginger  and  Tobacco  brought hence as well as from  America  And how much sooner and easier  IN one short and comprehensive View may be seen a Demonstration of the Diffe∣rence as to the  Company's Profit  between the  Slaves  they transport to  America  and those  whom they might employ if they pleas'd to raise Products for their own Benefit  TO say nothing of the Charge of Shipping them which wou'd be sav'd upon All so employ'd in  Africa  nor to insist on the ma∣fest Advantage of cheaper  Freight  and short∣er  Voyages  what can be plainer than this Way of ReasoningCompute the  Company's  Profit by the Sale of a  Negro  to be Equal with what might be Gain'd by him in a  Year's Work  over and above his Maintain∣ance and the Interest of his Prime Cost which it certainly never is yet the  Negro  that  WORKS  for the  Company  costs no more than One who is  SOLD  for them Whereas this  Last  is wholly  Lost  from that Day forward to their Interest while the  First  returns them Yearly the  same Profit during Life  without new  Charge  to Balance it  I SPOKE just now of Products which are commonly rais'd by our  Planters  in  America  and might as certainly be rais'd in  Africa  But there are  Eastern Harvests  of much greater Consequence which  Time  I hope will teach  This Company  to reap without more Difficulty than may gradually be sur∣mountedWhy not the richest of the  East Indian Spices Pepper Nutmegs Cloves  and  Cinnamon  procur'd and planted there They have  Soil  and  Climate  exactly the same with those in which they grow Nay they have  wild Spices  rising naturally under their  Agent's Eyes to be as it were an  Indication  and push 'em forward to Attempt it  BUT if they will not be perswaded to  transplant  Advantages at least they might pos∣sess themselves of those which lie before them They have  Gold  which the Natives gather and bring down to their Forts and Factories I know what  Difficulties  attend the  View  I am about proposing And I know too that tho' they are  Considerable  they are  far from Unsur∣mountable  What hinders then but that the  Uplands  might be discover'd and perhaps the  Gold Mines  found and work'd upon by the Natives themselves for the  Company's  Bene∣fit in Exchange for what those Natives va∣lue more but which wou'd cost little to their Furnishers And this Attempt tho' peacea∣bly establish'd and pursued might for more certain Safety be protected by the Awe of an Armed Force A very small one were sufficient here where Numbers are of little Strength for want of Courage or of Order  HOW much more Useful than some of their present Factories would Forts and Settle∣ments be a Hundred Miles or more in Di∣stance One above the Other along the  Ni∣ger  or some other of those Prodigious  Rivers  which flow a Course of two or three Thou∣sand Miles through the  Heart  of this vast and unknown  Continent  How easie were it for the People in these Forts to possess and cultivate a large Tract round them To dis∣cover the Bordering  Country  and  Trade  and  make Leagues with the Neighbouring  Prin∣ces  To maintain a regular and frequent Correspondence with each other by means of Light Vessels with flat Bottoms adapted to the Navigation properest for those  Rivers  And once a Year or oftener to send down their General Stores to the  Company's  Ships at the Entrance and receive back with the Return of their small Vessels what should be sent them from Home either for their Sup∣port or TraffickWhat new and number∣less Nations might the  Company  thus  Trade with at first Hand  to their unspeakable En∣richmentAnd were such an Entrance once open'd to them by expert and resolute Adventurers what popular Encrease of Con∣sumption would it not occasion in our  Wool∣len  and many other  Manufactures  THERE are no Impossibilies in Designs of this Nature but to narrow and confin'd Understandings and to Spirits of a heavy Fabrick But this  Company  has the Honour to be assisted by Great Genius's Wise and Enterprizing enough to mark out the Way to Measures that might soon recover them from the present  Ill Prospect of their Affairs  and make the Memory of the  ROYAL AFRICAN COMPANY  Dear and Glorious to all Posterity  IT is a  Work  of too much Length for such a Paper as mine is to  prove  how practicable these Things are But I shall sometimes occasionally touch the Subject with the Bre∣vity  I am confin'd to Because when I con∣sider into what Hands my  Hints  may fall I flatter my self they may grow  Fruitful  and become a  Service  to my  Country  THE  Duke of CHANDOS  in the Head of These has so Fine and so Enlarg'd a Spi∣rit and is so Great and so Acknowledg'd an Honour to our Nation That it is scarce possible to express in his Praise so much as every wise Man  must Think of him  I dare not therefore attempt so hard a Task as his full Character But while I mention him I am on Fire with such an Admiration of his Generous Qualities that I cannot forbear to close my Paper with such faint  Outlines  as can be Sketch'd by One who  draws  at too much Distance  IT is not alone in the Princely Grandeur of his  Oeconomy  that this Illustrious Lord reflects a Brightness on his  Honour'd Order  and points out to us in a shining Light what a  Nobleman  was meant to be  Appear∣ance  He well knows can be no more than the  Shadow  of Substantial  Glory  He looks inward therefore and draws out into Pra∣ctice and Example such a surprizing Train of  Vertues  That instead of supporting his  Di∣stinction  upon the  Title  which was so justly due to his He has added  to it  much more  Honour  than some who wear it with a Colder Spirit have been able to borrow  from it  THO' Descended from a  Noble Line  one of the most  Ancient  of the Kingdom He dis∣dain'd  to owe his Greatness to the Grandeur of his  Ancestors  Nor ever thought of his  ForeFather's Honours  but as an Archer rai∣ses his Eye to the Point of some high Steeple when he would shoot his Arrow  over it  HOW Inconsiderable in so Generous a  Taste  as  His  are all the  Glitterings  of a  De∣pendant Greatness  How much Nobler after  His more than Imperial  Manner to adorn and serve this Country his own un∣bounded Expence than to be more busie to perhaps less Purpose and be  Paid  for his Want of  Liberty  at the  Head  of an  Admini∣stration  THE World lies open to his Eye and All its Interests are exactly known to him But nothing can he see in any Part or happy Corner of it more belov'd and worthy than he himself isThere is this too Peculiar in him That his  Mind  with all its  Vastness  is serenely  Centrical  and  Regular  His  Pur∣poses  are as Rational as Great His  Under∣standing  is Clear His  Penetration  is Bound∣less His  Resolution  is Ardent and his  Ap∣plications  are Calm and Stedfast  HE knows and marks the nicest Diffe∣rence between Dignity and Pride Generosity and Ostentation Condescension and Weak∣nessHe reconciles State with Easiness and teaches Reverence to Freedom How Ex∣tensive is his Wisdom How Unwearied his Industry How Magnificent his Liberality How Enlarg'd are his Idea's How Unre∣strain'd  by Prejudice How Unconfin'd to PartyWhat Astonishment would it pro∣duce in the Minds of ordinary Men could a a History be given the World of the Im∣mensity of those Princely Expences which might be charg'd to his HumanityThe Charity of the Common World would blush and hide it self at the Comparison For the Munificence of this prodigious  Spirit  would swallow up all other Benignity as the Enli∣ven'd  Rod  of  Moses  devour'd the Serpents of the  Egyptians  THESE are his  Known  and  Publick Beau∣ties  But what Amiable  Private Qualities  must there be in so exalted a  Mind  which are hid from the distant  World  and appear only to those  Few  those  very Few  of his Friends who not alone are conversant with him but have  Souls sympathetical  enough to conceive the  Glowings  of his untold  Purposes  UNDER the Influence of  such a Power  what may not the  Gentlemen  of the  African House  expect would they Resolve upon such  Measures  as may suit the  Glory  of a  Company  of whom it will be said hereafter as was once said of  TYRE  and  SIDON Whose Mer∣chants were Princes and whose Traders The Nobles of the Earth  The Plain Dealer N  o    Scribendi recte sapere est Principium Fons  HOR  FRIDAY  November    THERE is no kind of  Wit  which re∣quires a livelier Force or more com∣prehensive Turn of  Spirit  than That which we inscribe on  Monuments  to express the  Characters  of the  Dead  And I am sorry I have Reason to observe That almost every Church in  England  is a Witness of our De∣ficience in itThe Fire of  Fancy  should on these Occasions be extreamly Intense and Subtile because wanting Continuity it has all its  Effect  at a  Flash  and can therefore have no  Medium  It must be either  piercing  or  contemptible  WHEN I stand before the  Tomb  of Mr  Dry∣den  in  WestminsterAbbey  I am in Debate with my self concerning that Delicacy of Ve∣neration which was the Cause of its being inscrib'd with no more than his  Immortal Name  The Noble Founder thought it Superfluous to add any Thing after that  Because there scarce  lives  a  Reader  who can be unacquainted with his  Character  Yet methinks on the other Hand the Expression of a Decent  Gratitude  may be held Due to a  Benefactor  however rais'd above the Want or Expectation of our Benevolence And to carry it yet farther tho' no Profanation cou'd be more unpardonable than the Pro∣duct of a  Vulgar Genius  on a  Subject  so exal∣ted there is at least  One Spirit  in the  Na∣tion  greatly Equal to the Labour And This the Founder of the  Monument  must have known more certainly than any other Person because more nearly conversant with and more sufficiently a Judge of him  I WOU'D not after this say I mean Mr  Pope  but that in the Course of my  Papers  I shall let him perceive that I am no  Flatterer  I have wish'd to see  His Soul  do Honour to his  Father's Dust  and animate a Marble which can never be more dignified than it is unless  His own Remains  shou'd visit itWhen my  Passions  feel his  Force  in  Eloise's  struggling  Conflicts  I attend him thro' the  Depths  of  Nature  with the Reve∣rence which is due to Godlike  Wisdom  and  Philosophy  And while my Fancy flames and glitters in the sportive Vastness of his  Levity  where  Belinda  's  Hair  attracts him I am transported at his  Wit  and  Gaiety  and grow  in Love  with his Good  Breeding  Yet Five Parts in Six I doubt of all that  Admi∣ration  which has been paid to these inimitable  Flights  of  Genius  is  Implicite  and  mere Ac∣cident  For there are  Strokes  so  fine  and  de∣licate  that like  Angels  they must be  invi∣sible  to the Eyes of  Common Mortals  and seen only by those happy  Few  whom  Heaven  vouchsafes  a Visit  to  I HAVE been shewn an EPITAPH lately which is said to have been written by this  Gentleman  for the  Tomb  of a Friend of his The Thought on which it turns is very happy and extreamly NaturalIt has been publish'd in some of our  WeeklyPapers  but not so full as I here give it  To this sad Shrine whoe're thou art draw near  Here lies the  FRIEND  most wept the  SON  most  dear  Who ne'er knew  Joy  but  Friendship  might divide  Nor gave his Father  Grief  but when he  died  How vain is Reason Eloquence how weak  When  POPE  must tell what  HARCOURT cannot speak  Yet  Let  thy once lov'd  Friend  inscribe thy Stone  And with a  Father  's Sorrows mix his own  Ah no 'tis vain to striveIt  will not be  No Grief that  can  be  told  is felt for  THEE  THE  Manuscripts  of this fine EPITAPH which are handed about Town have already  various Readings  And in some the two last Lines are wholly omitted But I can never suppose a Castration of that  Importance Ge∣nuine  because the  Close  at the first Break has a Strength so full and distinguish'd that  it left an absolute Necessity for a vigorous Turn of Thought in the Conclusion of that which follows it Whereas nothing could ap∣pear more languid and unequal to its Au∣thor than to have ended after so  fine  a  Stroke  with saying no more than this  Let your Friend write your Epitaph and tell the World that he is as sorry for your Death as your Father is  I HAVE not I think at home read any Piece of this Kind more striking and strongly rais'd upon the  Force  of its touching  Simplicity  But I remember to have seen two  Epitaphs  both  Foreign  which gave me a Delight of the same NatureI shall translate them as near I can into  Eng∣lish  This first is by a  French Poet  on the Death of  Cardinal Richlieu  And has in it a certain Mixture of the  Great  the  Natural  and the  Surprizing  which is very rarely to be met with  Stay Travellerfor All you want is near  Wisdom and Power I seek  They both lie here  Nay but I look for more and raise my Aim  To Wit Taste Learning Elegance and Fame  Here ends your Journey then For here the STORE  Of  RICHLIEƲ  lies  Alas repeat no more  Shame on my Pride What Hope is left for Me  When here Death treads on All that Man can be  THE Second which now follows is of  Spanish Original  and was the  Epitaph  of a beautiful Neice of the Famous  Oli∣varez  If weeping  Love  Inquirers seek to know  Her  Name  whose Charms enrich the Dust below  Point up and bid 'em readBut say no more  Nor strive in vain to count her  Vertues  o'er  Scarce cou'd the sweet Amount be justly sung  Tho' Her  Each Atom  were an  Angel  's  Tongue  WHERE there is Justness and Propriety in these  Rays  and  Beamings  of the  Wit  they break out upon our  Fancy  with irresistable Force and Lustre We are often dazzled for a Moment even with the false Imitation of it where the  proper Sence  is mingled and confounded with the  Metaphorical  But we no sooner examine it closely than the Coun∣terfeit Colours vanish and we despise our own and the  Poet  's  Weakness  Whereas when the Thought is  just  as well as  shining  when it is founded on Truth in Nature and only raises our Admiration by its Grandeur Grace and Nobleness the Heat contracted and pointed strong upon a near and single Center inflames and catches like a  Burning Glass  and Stocks and Stones are melted down by it almost as suddenly as Gold and Silver  IT were a Work of General Use and no unpleasant Entertainment to make a  Mu∣ster  of those False  Thoughts  or affected  Turns  of  Wit  and pass 'em in  Review  oppos'd to such as are True and SolidThe Common  Taste  would stand corrected and consent to give up their  Favourites  for Few can want Good Sense to distingush when they see 'em together and mark that  Truth  which is Nature represented exactly as she appears is the  Life  and  Soul  of Thinking and  Greatness Delicacy  and  Delightfulness  the fine  Dress  and  Ornaments  of it  THE black  Eyes  of the  Spanish Ladies  have a Jacko'theLanthern  Brightness  that is very apt to  mislead  the  Poets  of that warm Country The following  Sonnet  is a  Master∣piece  of its Kind and may deserve to stand as an  Example  of that  False Wit  abovemention'd As consisting chiefly of contra∣dictory  Idea's  which are forc'd together like  Oil  and  Spirit  by the Violence of the Writer's  Fancy  but seperate and distinguish themselves as soon as they have Time to  settle  I know too well my cruel FAIR  Why those sweet  Eyes  have  Sable  Covers  Mere Pity bids 'em  Mourning  wear  To grieve the  Fate  of  murder'd Lovers  Assist me then thou  killing  Maid  I  hate  my Foe and  must  defeat him  Oh lend me but those  Eyes  in Aid  And He's  Stone Dead  when next I meet him  BUT tho' such  Turns  as  These  are unnatu∣ral and therefore ridiculous when apply'd to any serious Purpose yet there  are Turns  both upon  Words  and  Thoughts  that pre∣serving the Truth of Meaning are so far from being Faults that in all the lighter Kinds of  Poetry  they are extremely graceful and desirable Thus in the famous  Epigram  of  Ausonius  relating to  Dido  who fled from  Phaenicia  to  Carthage  upon the Death of her Lover  Sichaeus  and afterwards died her self upon  Aeneas  's forsaking her the Thought is just and solid and tho' it glitters and is so full of  Point  yet it bears without  dimi∣nishing  every  Light  that it can be view'd inI will give both the  Latin  and the  English  because our  Language  has been judg'd incapable of expressing it without more Compass and Weakness than the  Original  Infelix  Dido  nulli bene nupta Marito  Hoc pereunte fugis Hoc fugiente peris  Poor Queen twice doom'd disastr'ous  Love  to try  You fly the Dying for the Flying die  THERE is something too of an elevated Smartness and that will bear the nicest Exa∣mination in the  Thought  of a  French Poet  concerning a  Cardinal  already nam'd who was accus'd of holding too great an  Ascendant  over his  Master  Il est trop absolu sur l' Esprit de son Maistre  Mais son Maistre per Luy est le Maistre des Roy's  Tho' he shadow'd his Master with arrogant Wings  Yet he made whom he master'd the Master of Kings  IT is this Power in the Conception This comprehensive Grasp of Meaning where more than can be  express'd  in Pages is crowded into a  single Sentiment  and insinuated to the Reader so as to swell and expand it self in his Understanding It is  This  that is True  Poetry  That makes up that illu∣strious  Art  which is therefore justly call'd  Divine  because it shakes and moulds the Soul and bows to its Purposes transports us out of our selves and raises a  Creation  round us which is wholly of its own esta∣blishing  BUT how different from this is  Poetry  as it is commonly understood and practis'dA trifling Skill in Measure and an easie Sweep in Rhyming are no more what makes the  Poet  than the  Chimes  can be call'd the  Church  or the  Chariot  makes the  Doctor  He who  thinks  in a vulgar Manner will be so far from concealing his Emptiness by the  Verse  he pretends to charm by that like the  dirty Fool  in the  Gospel  who invited himself to the  Marriage Feast  and sat down among the  finest Guests without a Wedding Garment  he will be put pointed out with  the more Contempt and serve to  set off  the vast Disparity between himself and those he presumes to mix with  WHOEVER does but reflect on the diffe∣rent  Figure France  now makes among the Princes of  Europe  compar'd with That which every Body remembers Her to have made within these Twenty Years will in Justice to a most Heroick Monarch divest himself of the ungenerous Littleness of Common National Prejudices and observe with Plea∣sure That Great Prince's Influence over the  Wit  and  Genius  as well as the  Courage  and  Obedience  of his PeopleWhen I read the  BirthDaySongs  of our  English Laureats  I see the Poorness of their  Salary  thro' the Slightness of their  Sentiments  But the most light and jovial Performances of our  Neigh∣bour Nation  when they had their  King  for their  Theme  seem'd to glow with a Warmth of Gratitude as if  Reason  strove with  Inven∣tion  which shou'd praise him with most Co∣piousness  Qu'il regne ce Heros qu'il triomphe toujours  Qu'avec luy soit toujours la Paix ou la Victoire  Que le Cours de ses Ans dure autant que le Cours  De la  Seine  de la  Loire  Qu'il vive autant que sa Gloire  May our  Hero  long reign and still triumph in State  And  Conquest  or  Peace  on his  Purposes  wait  Let the Course of his Years like the  Loire  and the  Seine  Flow with Fullness and Strength above  Time  's deepest Drain  For  while blest  with her  King  what has  France  to implore  But that  He  may  live  till his  Fame  lives no more  I DESIGN'D when I began this  Paper  to say a great deal more than I have left my self Room for concerning  Epitaphs  and  Elegies  but I must refer what remains to some other Opportunity And will conclude with one of the  Sublimest  Pieces of Extra∣vagance that ever heated the  Imagination  of of a  Poet  The Author was a  Portuguese  and in describing the Assault of a Fortress by his Countrymen speaks of the  Ditch  in a Flight at once so  wild  and yet so  strong  that it is impossible to find a Proof more pregnant that  Genius  without  Judgment  can do nothing considerable in  Poetry  The yawning Ditch  declin'd  with dreadful steep  And from Days aking  Eye  so backward fell  That  Saints  might pass thro' its unsounded Deep  To scare the  Devils  and let in  Light  on  Hell  The Plain Dealer No  dare Jura Maritis  HOR  MONDAY  November    PATTY AMBLE  has many  Friends  who will be glad to hear That the  COQUET  is come to Town after two whole Months Absence  LOVE  revisits me at the Approach of this  wild Creature  like the Return of a  Tertian Ague  So my  Rea∣ders  in mere Pity must be moderate when they find me  Dull  'Tis a  Rule  among us  LOVERS  to be either stark  Mad  or  Stu∣pid  See what an unaccountable  Letter  the  pert Baggage  has sent me  Dear SLAVY  AT last this sweet Town which must for ever hold my Heart has again Possession of my  Person  I left  Tunbridge  a Hundred Years ago and went a Pilgri∣mage in pure Compassion to visit a poor Thing in  Marriage Trammels  Where I have stuck fast ever since in the  Dirt  of your Dear  Sussex  WELL tho' I have but half forgiven you for setting That  breathing Whirligig Ned Volatile  upon me yet I think I am as much in  Love  with  You  as with any of your  Rival Candidates  for the  Place  I have to dispose ofBut if ever I marry you there is  One Thing  I must positively  insist on  You shall keep me  two Chairs  and a  Chariot  I had scarce a  Scruple  of Brains in my Head all last Week For after rumbling up in a  StageCoach  I was  pound∣ed to Death  from the dreadful  Borough  to  ParkPlace  in an odious  Hackney Mortar  You have  History  I know at your Finger's Ends Pray send me the  Name  of that Tragical  Roman  Tumbler who was barrell'd up by the  Carthaginians  and roll'd a Mile or two down Hill in a  Butt  stuck full of  TenpennyNails  Methinks I pity him from my Heart For I could not help thinking while I was bouncing up and down in my Vehicle like a Thim∣ble full of Shot in a Quart Bottle That my own  Case  was as bad as  His  At least if there was any Difference it lay only in a few  Points  which I had rather give up than  stand upon  HEAVEN  have Mercy on those poor  Citizens Wives  who when their hideous  Bedfellows  have made them too  big  to be able to  go  are forc'd to be  carried  in these Town Tumbrels'Tis well I was not chose for a  Knight of the Shire  at our last  Election The Rogues who contriv'd these  Bolting Hutches  to sift Peoples Bones thro their Skins shou'd never have escap'd  Pu∣nishment  for want of a Law to reach them I would have got an ACT  passed on pur∣pose  to

Taste  of yours we will be as Retir'd as two Snails in a Wilderness For I have resolv'd to be at Home to Nobody but  Jenny Ogle  and  Gatty Gosling  and dear Lady  Frightall  and Miss  Jumper  and  Jack Scarecrow  and  Jack  you know is  No∣body    Jack  is like one of the  Family  Only if  Sally Simple  should chance to drop inor  Fanny Prue  in her new  Equipage  there is  no being denied to Them  For the whole Town says That  Sally  has had a  Misfortune  since I went to  Tunbridge  And  Fanny  is a  Prude  that has stoop'd as low as  Matrimony  I long to see how they look after the Accidents that have befallen themDon't  fail  at your Peril for we want your Sage  Advice  about a  Project  that is newly come into our Heads and I shall never be at Rest 'till I know what you think of it  THE Business in one Word is  Free∣dom WOMAN's Freedom  For sure if  Men  who are born to be  Subjects  pretend  to  Liberty  and defie  Tyrants  our  Sex  must have high Pretensions who by  Nature  were form'd for  Sovereignty  and can make Slaves of  those  who enslave MillionsIn short we are come to a Resolution to  issue Writs  and call together a  Female Parlia∣ment  You allow that we have  WitWe our selves  know  we have Wisdom  And every Body has  Reason  to know that  we  can't want  Authority  So the Thing it self is past Dispute  we  have  decreed to take Government upon us  But the  Question  is Under what  Name  or  Title  we shall ex∣ercise it  WE are told by an Experienc'd  Sister  who is  sole Chamber Counsel  to an Emi∣nent  Counsellor at Law  that the Word  Par∣liament  will be too Bold and Ardent for our  Purpose  And yet if another of our Mem∣bers who is Learned in  Law French  be but as good at  Derivation  as she has always been at  Disputation She  will have  Parlia∣ment  to signifie  Prattlement  and in that Case who doubts but we might make good our  Pretensions  HOWEVER let it go We aim at No∣thing but our  just Prerogative  nor have any Design in the least against the  Privi∣leges  of the  other Houses  whose Members for any Thing I see to the contrary may be as  Capable  as  We  are  YET it were certainly no harder upon the  Men  That the  Women  should usurp  their Offices  than it is mortifying to us  Women  to see the  Men  interpose in  Ours  And what Truth can be more manifest than That there are MaleMembers of more Houses than One  ungallant  enough to in∣vade us in our very  Essentials  Some can  Dance  as well as we can some tho' Fewer indeed can even  talk  as wellHere and there one can  manage a Family  as wellBut an infinite Number of them can  wash their Months  as well and vye  Genius  with us in  Dress  and  Diversion  Nay I am credibly inform'd by an Able  CommitteeWoman  of our Assembly That she is intimate with  two  of them who are so  far gone  against us that the first  makes Shifts and Aprons  with the finest Workwoman of his Acquaintance And the other can  cut Paper  the best of any  Gentlewoman  in the three Kingdoms  IF such Wrongs as these must be  tolera∣ted  away with Order and DistinctionShall any Body after this say we ought not to assume a  Title  because the Nation has already bestow'd it on  Our Represen∣tatives  What were the  Nation  without  Us  And how are  WE Represented  where none of our  Sex  are permitted to sit and vote for  Us  Is this  Free Government  Is this to be subject to no Laws but those we have first given Cnsent toEither  let us as a distinct  Body  have a Right to  govern our Selves  or admit an Equal Number of  Us  to sit where  Laws  are  made for Us  And I believe I may venture to undertake for the  Absent  That we will be modest enough in that Case to content our selves with a  bare Negative  upon All Bills that concern  Us  BUT what shall we do about this  Diffi∣culty  of the  Name  Old Lady  Lofty  was for having us dignifie our Purpose with the awful Sound of  The SENATE  But her GrandDaughter who can read  Horace  in  Latin  said That  Title  had an Air too  Mo∣therly  and would  sit hard  upon Youth and GaietyIt was next mov'd That a  Commitee  of  Virgin Elders  shou'd be sent as far as  Poland  to borrow and bring Home the Use of the Word  DIETKitty Hoyden  leapt out of our her Chair to se∣cond this  Motion  She had been inform'd she said That  Polish Diets  are often sum∣mon'd to meet  on Horseback  and she was positive That no People could ride more Learnedly than the  Horsewomen  of our Country She added That little more seem'd peculiar to these  Polish Diets  un∣less it were their  Art  of  Quarrelling with∣out Interval  And in that too she saw no Reason why an  English Woman  might not equal them  IT was now in a fair Way to be carried on this side the  Question  when  Suky Shadely  who is newly recover'd from the  Jaundice  turn'd the Tyde of Opinions by crying out That she  protested  against the  Physical  Sound of the Word for it put her in Mind of her  Apothecary  What at last we all inclin'd to was the  Turkish Title  of  DIVAN  I think  CONVENTION  was whisper'd faintly but none of us knew what to make of it And as for  CONVOCATION  it was unanimously rejected upon the Insinu∣ation of a grave  ArchDeaconess  That it would be inconvenient to assume  known Ti∣tles  which under Pretence of  Custom  and  Precedent  might reduce us to Subordinati∣on and bring us to feel

Servant  MARTHA AMBLE  The Plain Dealer No  Quicquid praecipies esto brevis Ut citò dicta  Percipiant animi dociles teneantque fideles  Omne supervacuum pleno de pectore manat  HOR  FRIDAY  November    WHEN I was Young I remember among many other  Follies  I was very vain and tenacious of my own Way of Think∣ing I was particularly delighted with the  Notion  I then had of  Eloquence  And made no Manner of Dispute but I was my self a wonderful  Proficient  in it I was ravish'd with the flowing Swell of a longwinded Pe∣riod I had form'd my  Taste  of  Stile  upon  Cicero  and treated the  Commentaries  of  Cae∣sar  with an Extraordinary Air of Contempt when I compar'd them with the most frothy Flourishes of That everabounding  Orator  I HAD not learnt to consider That there is a Difference in the Effect of the same  Words  when they are  spoke  and when they are  written  When we  see  and  hear  a powerful  Orator  our Reason is betray'd and  dazzled by the Interposition of our Sen∣sesThe Grace and Majesty of his  Person  The neverresting Variety of his  Mo∣tion  The Aptness of his  Looks  and  Gesture  The Rise and Fall of his  Voice insinuating softening accusing repeating urging impres∣sing  and  enforcing  with a  Gradation  of the strongest  Passions  All these combine to charm and cheat us into AdmirationBut when divested of these Prejudices we come to  read  with a steady Judgment what we  heard  with so much Emotion the cold and languid  Oratory  depending now on  Sense  and wanting all its Aid of  Emphasis  and  Utterance  lies tasteless on our Under∣standing and  Repetition  and  Change  of  Lights  are found to fill up the Place of  Richness  and  Variety  in the  Conception  ONE of the first who made me bold enough to break out of my  Roman Bondage  and resolve for the future to think all  Words  which give a Discourse no Progress in its Meaning rather Burdens than Embroi∣dery was  Montaigne  where he is speaking of Authors  AS to  Cicero  says this freespirited  French∣man  to confess the  Truth  frankly His way of Writing appears to me very tedious His  Prefaces Definitions Divisions  and  Etimolo∣gies  take up the greatest Part of his  Work  There is  Life  indeed and  noble Life  but it is smother'd in the dressing When I have spent an Hour in reading him I recollect  what  Substance  I have gather'd from him and find for the most Part I have got no∣thing but  Wind  He is not  yet  come far enough to be Enter'd upon his  Reasons  Now for  Me  who only desire to be  Wise  not  Eloquent  I wou'd read nothing but what is to the  Purpose  I know well enough without being told What is  meant  by  Death  and  Pleasure  Why then do they give them∣selves the Trouble of  Anatomising  them I am for  Reason  and  Argument  at the first Dash and wou'd be instructed how to  with∣stand  rather than  talk quaintly of  my Passions I am for Charging at once into the Heart of the Doubt and not Approaching it by Way of  Siege  with Logical  Lines  and  Trenches  The Subjects of  Cicero  languish by his De∣laying our Expectation His Way was very well for the  Bar  or might do perhaps for the  Pulpit  and since 'tis so common to  Nod  at a  Sermon  Men in this Case might have Leisure to  take a Nap  and wake a Quarter of an Hour after Time enough to find the Thread of the  Discourse  Men may speak in this Manner to  Children  or to  ignorant People  But I can never be made Attentive by an Author's Elocution where his  Matter  is too weak to hold me  BEFORE I had the Cood Fortune to meet with this Censure which carries with it no more  Boldness  than  Reason  I had ventur'd to appear in  Print  and sent some  Treatises  into the World which I have never thought  of from that Time forward without blush∣ing at my Conscious Weakness in the Affe∣ctation of a  Stile  so  Wordy  that it moves my own Indignation very strongly against my self for what I have formerly consider'd as no small Part of my  Merit  IF my  own Works  were of Importance enough I wou'd  light 'em up  as a  Beacon  to warn Others of the Danger But since That  Honour  is more than they deserve I disclaim it with due Modesty and will borrow an Example of like Nature from an Author of more Dignity  THE Gentleman I mean is a Reverend and Learned  Professor  In whose  Preface  to an excellent Translation of  Virgil  we are told after at least as much  Instruction  as cou'd  reasonably  have been expected That  He has not yet done with us For something more still remains behind  NOW tho' much may be said for this Gentleman's  Generosity  from the Profusion of his Desire to  satisfy  us yet a less Degree of Praise will be sufficient for his  Discretion  Since it was not kind enough to whisper in his Ear that He who tells us the same Thing  Six Times over  will rather provoke us to  Indignation  than to  Gratitude  because it argues an Opinion in him That he is talking to Persons who have a  Deafness  in their UnderstandingWhen he had assur'd us  He had not yet done  There cou'd be no Rea∣son in the World but the overobliging Li∣berality  of his  Rhetorick  to take the Trou∣ble of adding that  There was something more  Much less That there was  something more still  But when he goes on with so unhop'd so unexpected a Flow of Boun∣ty as to add That there was  something more still that remain'd  The Obligation was  enforc'd  to so surprizing a Height that it must have been judg'd Impossible to raise it more if we had not found immediately after That not only  something more still remain'd  but that it  remain'd behind  also  I COU'D wish to see it establish'd as a Rule among  Writers  That every Word should be a Fault which being taken out of a  Discourse  left no  Void  in the  Sense  For to what End shou'd we use Expressions which may be cut off without  Maiming  or let stand without  Beauty  WHEN the Pen of One who attempts to write  History  happens to be thus  dropsically  disposed He never fails to drown his  Facts  in a Deluge of  Affectation  We have then long  Speeches  of great Generals made to their Armies in Line of Battle and just on the Point of Engagement In which the monstrous Absurdity of supposing such a Time fit for formal Harangues or that they could be Audible to the Hundredth Part of the Numbers they are address'd to is not sufficient to deter these Orators from display∣ing all their  Tropes  with so much Fullness and Variety that when the Armies come to  Charge  the Historian has not Spirits enough left him after the Fatigue of his  War of Eloquence  to observe or explain to us How the Battle it self was formed and fought or by what Conduct on one side or Mi∣stake on the other The Fortune of the Day delcared in Favour of the  Victorious  TACITUS  of all Historians was least guilty of using Wordiness or Circumlocu∣tion in his RelationsOn the contrary when he errs it is in the much nobler Ex∣tream of too Rich and Delicate an Excess of  Sense  He refines not on  Words  but on  Things  he  speaks  less for his Great Persons than They  spoke  for Themselves But he  thinks  for them much more delicately than it is probable  They  ever thoughtWhen  Gal∣gacus  at the Head of his  Britons  is about to charge the  Roman  Army what Number of Eloquent Pages could have inspired his Followers with Reflections more apt to in∣flame them with Heroick Sentiments than what He  flash  'd upon their Imaginations in this comprehensive Encouragement  Fall on my Friends and in the  Shock  think of your ANCESTORS and your POSTE∣RITY  ANTIQUITY can scarce produce an In∣stance of more perswasive Eloquence than This  Oration in a single Sentence  But I have the Pleasure to see before me the Speech of a  Modern Leader  which as it had an End very different so its Influence was  much more powerful  Caesar  and many Generals before and after him inspired  fainthearted Followers with Courage  But This is the only Instance I have ever met with of a Commander who had Rhetorick enough to  talk Brave Fellows into Cowardice  THE Hero of our Story which is sin∣cerely a  true  one was at his Studies in One of the Universities of a NeighbourNation when the late Rebellion broke out and allarmed the Care of the Government He was Young and designed for a Pillar of his  Mother Kirk  Grace and Sanctity had there∣fore been more in his Thoughts than Arms and Slaughter But some of his Friends who claimed a Power in raising and dispo∣sing the  Militia  took a Fancy to dignify the young  Kirkman  with the Command of a  Company  and gave him Orders to march them to a  Rendezvous  that was appointed a few Days after  THE  New Captain  as He tells the Story Himself with a great Deal of Humour and Frankness thought  Safety  more his Business than  Valour  Yet was ashamed to appear Fearful when Every Body round him look∣ed as big as a  Bajazet  He resolved there∣fore To have Recourse to his  Oratory  and try if it was not possible under Pretence of  Encouraging  his Men to frighten them into  Desertion  In Pursuance of this Hope He drew them on the Morning appointed for the March into a Ring at the Foot of a little  Mount and placing himself on the Top of it addressed them in the following Ora∣tion which he gave me in his own HandWriting  Friends Brethren CountryMen  WE are marching against  Enemies  who are marching against  God  For they fight against our  King  and our King protects our  Kirk  and our  Kirk  is the Care of  God  So  our  Enemies are  God  's Enemies and our Cause  must  prevail against them  AS an Officer of Command and a Lea∣der who knows  No Fear  It is my Duty to speak to You in a Stile that may inflame your CourageBut as I am a  Christian  as well as a  Soldier  A Man of  Humanity  as well as  Mettle  I dare not conceal from You That there is a Danger which I my self am afraid of I who to speak in the World's Notion of  Fear  am so  resolv'd  that I can  fear Nothing  I mean my Fellow Soldiers The Danger which some of your Dear  Souls  may be in of rushing Headlong upon  Damnation  IN all Probability there will be an Im∣mediate EngagementI am confident we shall I mean All who survive the Battle shall suceed in the EventBut alas which of us knows whose Lot it will be to  Fall  in the Field of Slaughter And since there is Odds against your Lives  Are Ye prepar'd for approaching Death    It is indeed an  unseasonable  but ah my Friends It is a  necessary  QuestionAre ye  prepar'd  I say to dieHave ye  Assu∣rance  of  Salvation  I acknowledge That your Piety your Loyalty and your Bravery may intitle you to  Hopes  of Glory But if you want the  Inward Token  the  Assurance  the  Testimony  If you are not  positive  my Friends Ye are  DOUBTERS  And  He who doubteth  says  Holy Writ    is Damn'd  Mark  That  Brethren  He who doubt∣eth is damn'd  AH weigh this important Question be∣fore I lead you a Step farther Knock at your Bosoms Ask your Consciences If ye are  Doubters  And if ye find ye are  Upright  and  Stedfast  If ye have clear and unquestioned EvidenceIf your Lives have been  Pure  and your Bodies  Undefiled  Your  Credentials  for  Heaven  are Goodand ye may follow  me  un∣dauntedlyfor  Nildesperandum est Teucro Duce Auspice Teucro  That is being interpreted  King  GEORGE  for Ever  Amen  BUT If you  doubt  If ye Faint If your Inward Man is not StrongI desire none none of your fruitless AidI shall be more Triumphant without Ye Neither  would I have your Blood upon my Head since if ye  die  you will be  damn'd  But my  Christian  Concern for your  Souls  hath made me forget that ye are  Soldiers  I come down to put my self before you and let you see by my Example in the hor∣rid Bloodinesses of this Day What an As∣surance there is in the  Accepted  when they fight against the  Doubtful  I leave the Rest to your Consciences They who  doubt not  will follow me  N B  They ran away to a Man from behind their CommanderWhat an In∣stance was here of the

there  The Plain Dealer N  o    Mens immota manet  VIRG  FRIDAY  November    AMONG the Beauties of Magnanimi∣ty there is none of a nobler Quality than the Power of  forgiving Injuries  It throws a Majesty over the  Mind  and illustrates the  Person  with an Air of Sweetness and SerenityWe ought the more to admire it since whereever it is found It is in Com∣pany with the  Sublimest Virtues  There not being  Room  for it in a narrow vulgar  Soul  because overfill'd with Little Senti∣ments such as have their Rise and Revolu∣tion within the Circle of  SelfInterest  BUT the Brutal Passion of REVENGE and a malicious Memory for  Mischief  is become so Shameless and Licentious that it is com∣mon to hear Resolutions of retain'd Malice avow'd coldly and in general Expressions Such as  Setting upon People's SkirtsFinding a Time to be Even with them  and the like malignant silly Phrases whereby the Burn∣ings  of an inward Hatred seem to struggle for Eruption  METHINKS a sufficient Fortification against so abject a Frailty might be drawn from such Natural Reflections as TheseThat  In violently returning Wrongs  we do Nothing but what  Beasts  can do more rea∣dilyThat in  Malice  the most Exalted  Noble  is but on a Level with the Lowest  Slave  Whereas to  Pardon  is an Act of  Sovereignty  and however  Inferior  we were  before  to the Person who has injured us From the Moment in which we  forgive him  we exchange Conditions and become  Su∣perior  BUT since many who have no Ambition to be thought Men of  Virtue  would yet gladly be esteemed  Wise  It may be an Ar∣gument of more  Perswasion  That This Propensity to  Revenge  is a Mark not of  MeanSpiritedness  only but of  Ignorance  The Man of Knowledge can never be enough surpriz'd at Common Wrongs to be inflam'd into a Resentment either too Malicious or too ViolentHis Wisdom has instructed him That whereever we find  Men  we shall be sure to find  Injuries  And That there is a Necessity of its being so from the incompa∣tible and opposite Wills Humours and Interests among Mankind  SHOU'D the Treacherous the Suspicious the Covetous the Insolent or the Reproach∣ful behave themselves otherwise than we  could have expected from their Natures we might be justified in our  Wonder  at itBut why should we express Amazement at what it was natural for us to depend on Why be  Angry  with the  Inconsiderable  Most of Those who provoke and offend us deserve rather our Grief and Pity For They are no more in their own Hands than a  Mad∣man  or an  Ideot  is And we make a poorer Figure than our Pride allows us to  believe  when we disquiet our selves on such weak MotivesWhen a  Fool  throws a  Straw  at us It were to seem  light  to feel the Weight of it And  He  will never enjoy  Rest  who is not Master of Resolution to  forgive  All Those Injuries which his Honour or his Safety does not  compel  him to defend himself against  NEITHER is there only a Wisdom and a NoblenessThere is something too of a generous  Courage  in a Heart that is above the Reach of these vindictive Impres∣sionsThe Levity that is shewn in be∣ing moved at every Trifle carries with it an Air of Faintness and may be mistaken for  Pusila  ity  For the firm and manly Tem∣per apprehending Nothing with  Fear  re∣ceives all Accidents with  Calmness  And justly conscious of its Strength to support it self against Danger is Indifferent to the In∣discretions or Animosities of malignant Na∣tures  THERE is a single heroick  Word  in the History of the  Life  of  Adrian  which I could never read without Emotions of the highest Admiration and which carries in it the Instruction and Sublimity of many Vo∣lumesAfter That GreatSpirited Prince became possessed of the Empire He met a Person in the publick Way who had been his most implacable and bitter EnemyThe Wretch whose Heart was as  contracted  as His Malice had been  extensive  began to tremble with Expectation of some severe and sudden Punishmentsuch as He knew He would Himself have inflicted on  Adrian  had the Emperor's Power been  His  But  Adrian  with the serenest Gravity only whisper'd as He pass'd him  EVASISTIYou have Escap'd me  ALL that  Largeness of Soul  could inspire or Eloquence adorn and utter seems to have been express'd in this  ESCAP'D ME  It laid open to the View of the World the Mighty Heart of it's Great SpeakerIt declared him nobly sensible That  Justice  would look like  Malice  should He now when at the Head of Empire re∣venge upon a Private Enemy the Contempt He met with while a SubjectThat very  Power  and  Command of Punishment  which sordid Natures would have used with Gree∣diness to the Destruction of the Man they hated  restrained  and  temper'd  His Resent∣mentHe considered Himself as no longer  on a  Level  with his Injurer The  Protection  which he owned his  Subject  disarmed the Hatred which he bore his  EnemyYou have escaped  He meant to say in That sig∣nificant single Word  You have escaped by my becoming your MASTER the Vengeance which you should have felt from me had I continued but your EQUALThat  ADRIAN  is now no more from whom you could not have expected Mercy And This  ADRIAN  who gives you Pardon owes Com∣passion to His offending Subjects and remembers none of the  Other  's Injuries    IT is impossible but a Collection of such amiable Examples as This enforced by some perswasive Pen must work strongly upon the Minds of Men not depraved into utter Tastlessness For by striking even  Little Hearts  with a clear Conviction That the  Precept  contains Nothing but what has been exceeded in the  Practice  It would leave them no Pretence for Evasion and insinuate by a gradual Progress out of their Memory into their Imitation  BUT Nothing furnishes more Occasion for Surprize and Indignation than to ob∣serve our Places of Publick Worship filled with  Outside Formalists  of all Ranks and of both Sexes who either with an impious  Hypocrisy  or a  Stupidity  as dark as  Ideotism  affront the Majesty of Heaven by petition∣ing  GOD  's  Pardonas They Themselves pardon Others  While at the very Moment  of their Kneeling in this empty Mockery of Devotion It is known to one Half the Congregation That the Hearts of the other Half are imbitter'd with malicious Purposes and glowing with a painful Restlessness till they can be revenged for some slight Indig∣nityCould These People have a Sense of the Signification of the Words they utter They would tremble at the Apprehension of having What they pray for  granted literally  and the Mercy of That dreadful GOD they dare to trifle with  refused  to their Unwor∣thiness till they have learnt as readily to  for∣give  as to  pray to be forgiven  BUT exclusive of those severer Arguments which might be drawn from  Grace  and  Vir∣tue  There is  One  which  must  be welcome because we all agree to  love ourselves  and no Enemy is so Troublesome as  Malice  to our  Pride  our  Health  and our  Quiet  We submit our selves by this unmanly Passion to the Humours of the Men we hateWe empower them to afflict and mortifie usAt the Sight of a Person against whom we meditate Revenge our Spirits undergo a Tempest And even when he is absent our Memory goads and tortures usOur very Dreams become imbitter'd and confound our  Rest  with our  Disquiet  We wish the Evil to Another but we in∣flict it on our Selves And contrary to our own Intention become  Patients  where we design to be  Agents  The Revenger lives  in Torment and He on whom He would be revenged is at Ease  IT is a grinding gnawing Passion that preys inward upon the Heart and mistakes the  Means  of its own  Purpose  What Triumph can  Revenge  afford us but from a Reflexion That the Person punished repents and wishes the Wrong unacted This End can never be obtain'd by  Mischiefs  for by provoking  new  Malice they make the Me∣mory of the  old  delightful But it may be nobly effected by astonishing disgracing and confounding an Enemy with  Benefits  in re∣turn for his  Demerit  And This is what the most Venerable of all Books very strongly ex∣presses by  heaping Coals of Fire on His Head  That is It burns and wounds his Imagina∣tion with a conscious Shame at his  Inferior Figure  while He sees himself disgraced by Services from That Person of all the World whom he least deserved to be obliged byThe stubborn Virtue of  CATO  would have allowed him to submit to  CAESAR  but that his  Pride  was more afraid of a  Par∣don  than his  Person  was of an  Insult  MEN of Spirit shou'd  despise  this Passion because it is evident That the  weakest  Minds are most malicious and revengefulChildren Women and Men less resolute than Women sting and fret themselves with sense of Slights Contempts and Follies which they miscall Injuries while the  Ra∣tional  and  Stedfast  Mind neglects or smiles  at all such AccidentsTheir Effects may flutter round him but when they find no Place to enter at are  lost  in fruitless Murmurings like a Tempest that is re∣puls'd against the Firmness of a Moun∣tainThe  Distasts Aspersions  and  In∣dignities  which appear so formidable to an Abject Nature may be compared with Thunder and Lightning which are  terrible  to our  Lower World  but have nothing in them worth the Notice of those Angels and superior Spirits which inhabit the  Caele∣lestial  Regions  SCIPIO CAESAR ALEXANDER  All the Great and Shining Characters which have made Anti∣quity Illustrious have been so far from stoop∣ing to indulge  Revenge  that on the con∣trary they have sought Occasions to over∣whelm with  torturing Kindnesses  the most malicious of their Personal Enemies  BUT a Mixture of  Shade  with  Light  being necessary to compleat a Picture I will set them off by one another in a Comparison between a MONARCH and a MINISTER out of  Mirkond  a  Persian  Writer  A POET whose Name was  Delah  at∣tracted by the Fame of  OgtaiKhan  's Munificence undertook a Journey on foot from the remotest Parts of  Tartary  as far as to That Prince's Court in  China  for no other Purpose than to throw him∣self  at the Foot of his Throne and im∣plore his Assistance to discharge a Debt of  Five Hundred Balisches  under the Weight of which he became dispirited and was interrupted in his StudiesThe Generous Prince conversing with him and discerning his Extraordinary Merit enter∣tain'd him very graciously and order'd him  a Thousand  His Chief Minister re∣monstrated That this was rather  Prodiga∣lity  than  Bounty  to give  Double  the Sum demanded  Have you not consider'd  re∣ply'd OgtaiKhan  That the Poor Man has travell'd over the Mountains and Desarts merely on the Fame of our Liberality And shou'd we send him back with no more than is just sufficient to pay his Debts by what Means will he be able to Defray the Charges of his Journey  But your Highness answer'd the Minister has not yet been inform'd That he presum'd to write a  Satyr  against  ME  since his coming hither because I was unwilling to allow him Access with so im∣pertinent a Petition  For which Reason  reply'd the Prince  You shall present him with another Thousand  out of your own Pri∣vate Purse  That he may go back and tell his Countrymen there is a Monarch in this part of the World who permits not his MINISTERS's RESENTMENTS to be the Measures of his Bounty  JUST half as good a Story we read of  Queen Elizabeth  and  our Spencer  She had order'd him a  Hundred Marks  for some Piece of his Poetry But the Frugal  Treasurer  of those Days whose  Wit  was too Little for his  Wisdom  took upon him to tell the  Queen  it was too much Money for an  Idle Ballad  Give him then said She what you think he deserves  in Reason  He reply'd  he would consider of it  which he delay'd to do so long that at last he quite forgot it  THE  Queen  a Year or two after din'd in one of her  Progresses  at the House of a Gentleman where  Spencer  happen'd to be who in Presence of his Friend the  Treasurer  put into her Hands these Verses  I was promis'd on a Time  To have Reason for my Rhime  But from that Time unto this Season  I have had nor Rhime nor Reason  THE  Queen  says the Story was highly pleas'd with the Humour and commanded the  Treasurer  to pay him Double the Sum first order'dHad She added That he shou'd pay it  out of his own Private Purse  we shou'd have found no Occasion to mend her deficient Example by a Better in that of  OgtaiKhan  just mention'd  The Plain Dealer N  o    Proprium humani ingenii odisse quos laeserit  TACIT  MONDAY  November    MAHOMET  the IId That victorious  Turkish  Emperor who took  Constantinople  from the Christians had a very great Genius for Poetry and was so warm in its Encourage∣ment that He is reported to have offer'd Re∣wards for every  Fault  that cou'd be pointed out in the Works of his  Court Poets  and made Good against the Arguments which shou'd be brought in Favour of the Defendants  HEAVEN be prais'd That His Majesty of  GREAT BRITAIN  has no such partial Opinion of the Poets of our Age and Coun∣try Such a Proclamation wou'd drain his Exchequer more effectually than a Ten Years  War  with the strongest Power of  Europe  BUT I believe we may live at Ease The Encouragement of the Poet's Art in this present Generation will occasion no Pro∣fuseness that can be dangerous to the Reve∣nue  And as for our  Great Men  They are  Patrons  for the most Part as They are  Doctors  and  Masters of Art  rather by Acci∣dent than by Purpose and think themselves under no Obligation to  pay for  Compliments which their Conscience tells them They have  No Right to  THE Truth is when Any Thing so Ex∣traordinary falls out as That A Man of Quality is Witty Himself and an Encou∣rager of Wit in Others The Poets are so Unmerciful in their Assaults on his Libe∣rality That His Equals in Dignity have found much Safety and Comfort in the Fame of  Dullness  And there never was a livelier Proof of the Soundness of That Common Maxim that  Honesty is the best Policy  than the Success of the fashionable Expedient at once so frank and so ingenious of return∣ing the Dedicator's Gilt Book with this short Apology for not accepting it  My Lord gives his Service and says He does not UNDERSTAND these Matters  FOR Want of some such dext'rous  Stroke of Art  The Grandees of That  Turkish  Emperor's Court whom I nam'd at the Head of my Paper were often reduc'd to a  Nonplus  It was particularly the Case of  AliBasha  His Favourite  Treasurer  He had learnt to  Read  and  cast Accompts  But  Wit  being  out of his Way  He had one regular Method of re∣warding All who address'd their Writings to Him He put the Book into one Scale and  dropt Gold into another and having  adjusted the Balance  gave the  Weight  of the Work as a Gratuity to the AuthorThe worst Effect of this General Rule was That it was common for the  lightest Discourses  to bring with them the  heaviest Bindings  There was nothing more  Substantial  than the  Covers  of this Great Patron's BooksBut one Poet above the Rest had contriv'd a pleasant Scheme to make the most of his Ingenuity He compos'd a Copy of Verses and instead of  Writing  them in the usual Manner caus'd them to be  Engrav'd  on a Block of  Marble  that was large enough for a  Tomb∣stone  He loaded a Cart with his Compli∣ment and went to wait on the Basha with it who having Notice of his intended Present sent out the Master of his Buildings to examine the Size and Workmanship of the Stone and pay for it according to its ValueThe Poet went away very much surpriz'd and dissatisfy'd and writ his Patron a Com∣plaint How contrary to His  Greatness  's Cu∣stom His Officers had presum'd to Treat him To which the  Basha  answer'd gravely That  it arose from a Change in His MannerFor whereas he had formerly reward∣ed by WEIGHT He shou'd hereafter do it by MEASURE  WE have  some  among our Nobility who are equally Illustrious for their  Learning  and their  Patronage  of Learning But they are so  Poetically persecuted  by the Swarms of Little  Creatures who have no End in Writing but the Profit they propose to draw from it That they meet with daily Provocations to repel the Avarice of Flattery with a Spirit and Sharpness like the  Basha's  abovemen∣tion'd And This no Doubt is one Reason for the Neglect which  Works of Genius  often meet with when address'd to Men of Quality  BUT if Contempt is due to the  Merce∣nary  The  Modest  deserve Encouragement And They who are truly Generous shou'd never wait till Occasion offers it self but seek and make the Opportunity For as the Sharpness of our  Sight  is best prov'd by the  Remoteness  in which we distinguish Ob∣jects so our  Judgment  appears most strongly when we discern Merit at  Distance  and  invite  it to aproach us  I AM always pleas'd with the Prospect of Any Work from which the  Publick  may promise It self either Entertainment or In∣struction And I hope The Gentleman who has sent me the following Verses and Letter will have no Reason to complain of the Recep∣tion His Design shall meet with  The  HAPPY MAN  HIGH o'er the Winding of a cliffy Shoar  From whose worn

Copy of Verses of a great Number which my Friends have been kind enough to savour me with in Order to furnish out a  Collection of Miscel∣laneous POEMS  Concerning which you may possibly have met with a Proposal in the Hands of some of your Acquaintance for their being  publish'd by Subscription  in the Name of  Richard Savage  Son of the late  Earl Rivers  I AM Sir That unfortunate  Richard Savage  the peculiar Circumstances of whose uncommon Treatment from a Mother whose fine Qualities make it impossible to me  not to forgive her  even while I am  miserable by Her Means only  induced You some Months since in your  Twenty Eighth Paper  to publish a Few ineffectual Lines which I had written on Her surpriz∣ing Usage of me To which your Huma∣nity was pleas'd to add certain Reflections in my Favour which I remember with due Gratitude and am encouraged by That Instance of your Goodness to make the present Application  WHEN you shall have perused my Extra∣ordinary  Case  and Those convincing  Origi∣nal Letters  which I have entrusted with the Gentleman who brings you This I shall need say no more to satisfie You What  Right  I have to  complain  in a more  Publick Manner  than I have yet allowed my self to resolve onThe  Papers  in the Order you will see them are prepared for a Hand too  Just  and too  Powerful  to to leave me the least Distrust of being shortly  less oppressed than I have been  But I judged my self obliged to lay them under  your  Eye That you might be sensible you said less of my  Wrongs  and my  Suf∣ferings  than the unhappy  Truth  could have justified  AS to the mentioned  Collection of  POEMS They are some of 'em my own But many more the Works of Eminent Hands for the most Part never before publish'dThe  Subscription  will be  Half a Guinea  And as I can sollicite Nothing with  Im∣portunity  in which tho' a  small one  I have a visible  Interest  my Subscribers will be only Those who if They think They see any Thing in  me  or in my  Design  worth their Notice or Encouragement can have Generosity enough to save me the Confu∣sion of  applying to them  and send their  Names  and the Number of Books they subscribe for to  Button  's  CoffeeHouse  in  CoventGarden  where Receipts will be given  THE  Book  is now in the Press and will be published as soon as it can be  printed off  If you find among the  Poems  which my Friend has desir'd he may shew you What you think worthy of your Aprroba∣tion In That Case and in  That only  I shall hope your favourable Interposition in Behalf of  SIR  Your most obliged humble  Servant RICHARD SAVAGE  I HAVE purposely  left out  much of This ingenious and unhappy Gentleman's Letter which was very new and surpriz∣ing and affected me with the most touching GriefIf I apprehend His Case clearly  and the Proofs He sent me are too  strong  to be easily mistaken It is in some Mea∣sure to be considered as  That of an Injured Nobleman  But of This the World will judge for it self when the Particulars shall be more publick  That  is His  own  imme∣diate  Concern  and will I suppose be His  own Care  But His  Proposal  is What  Every Body  ought to take Part in because the Book in itself has a very uncommon Merit And Both  Merit  and  IllFortune  join to recommend the Proposer  I THINK it was finely said by a Gentle∣man whose Writings and Humanity were for many Years the Admiration of the King∣dom  That it ought to be the Care of All in whose Power it lay to lift Mr  SAVAGE  above a Sense of his  MOTHER  's Cruelty because a Misery so undeserved had intitled him to a Right of finding Every Good Man his  FATHER  BUT when to a  Misery so undeserved  we add a  Design so full of Reason  It is impossible but there must be  Many  who will feel a noble Delight in distinguishing their Zeal for so modest a Proposer and send their own Names and Those of Others whom they can Influence as so many  Examples  when the  List  comes to be publish'd That we have Spirits who can discover  Genius  before it rises into  Noise  and dare promote it without  waiting  till the  Way has been led by Others  The Plain Dealer No  Fuit haec Sapientia quondam  Publica privatis secernere sacra profanis  HOR  FRIDAY  December    MY Devotion I am afraid is not so  Pure  and  Simple  as it ought to be There is a  Niceness  in my Taste of other People's Behaviour at Church which ill agrees with the Duty which I my self am there for the Discharge of  I discovered this Defect of  Grace  in the Constitution of my Zeal by a kind of Re∣probate  Contempt  which I found my self affected by last  Sunday  against that plain and humble Aukwardness with which the mangled  Psalms  of  David  were vociferated by the CongregationA Gentleman of my Acquaintance unluckily whispered me in the midst of what they call their  Singing  That he knew a  Dutch  Painter who had drawn the liveliest  Grotesque  Piece in  Europe  by an Idea that he brought out of Church  with him from a Gallery of  Country PsalmsSingers  MY Eyes and Ears took his Hint and I shall never forget the  Group  of Living Ima∣geryThe Rolling Eyes Raised Faces Hanging Heads Oblique Chins Stretch'd Mouths and Distorted MusclesThe  Voi∣ces  too were as provokingly dissonant as the  Looks  were ludicrously penitentialInstead of finding my Thoughts exalted by the Spirit of transporting  Harmony  I became  ashamed  at the presumptuous License with which the Coarsest and most unskilful  Roar∣ers  took upon 'em to  bear Part  in Musick Sacred to the Praises of the ALMIGHTY  THIS brought to my Reflection with how much Reason as well as Reverence The  Choirs  of our  Cathedral  Churches preserve the Dignity of their Religious Harmony by  ex∣cluding the Unskill'd  and aiding the Attracted Heart by all the sweet and melting Force of Vocal and of Instrumental Musick in its most moving Elegance and Perfection  BUT It is not only the Manner in which  Psalms  are commonly sung that I consider as an Indecency The  Psalms Themselves  as we have them in the old  English  Version are a Disgrace to our our Learning Language and our Religion  Who  that forms his Notion of  David  's Genius from his Poetry as This Translation gives it us could possibly  believe  Him the Sublimest of All Human Writers Who that should read these Lines as they run in the Exalted Original  Lord Let not All  alike  Thy  Mercy  share  Strike  the PRESUMPTUOUS but the LOWLY  spare  WHO I say could suppose He had  found  them either in the  Sense  or the despicable  Expression  of This which follows from our Vulgar Version  O Lord then be not Slack  Nor draw thy Hand  aback  But pluck it forth from out thy  Lap  And give thy Foes a RAP  THE  Sectarians  who are too frequently exceeding Rigid and Narrow in their Ad∣herence to imbib'd Prejudices seem rather to affect than discourage  Cant  and  Dullness  in their Religious Eloquence And it is a very  Extraordinary  Reason which some of those Gentlemen have been pleased to give us  in Print  for the want of Taste and Incapa∣city with which the Noblest and most Ele∣vated Strokes of  David  's Sacred Poetry have been debased into Low and untune∣able Jargon  God's Altars need none of our Polishing  As if to write poorly were a  Merit  in Religious Treatises and it were possible to find a Subject more adapted to the Fullness of Art than the Praises of That GOD who formed Both  Art  and  Nature  THERE is Nothing so Rapturous No∣thing so strongly painted in all the noblest  Warmths of Fancy or of Judgment which have immortalized the Antient Poets as most of the  Hebrew  Descriptions of the Power and Majesty of GOD And among These The CIVth  Psalm  and especially the First Part of it is a Collection in one View of the most  Dreadful  and  Amiable  of the Almighty's Attributes So glowingly conceived and re∣presented in such lively Fullness that all the  Greek  and  Latin ODES  are faint and languid in Comparison with it  IT is impossible to  Translate  the Images of This prodigious Poet without doing them some Injustice But having lately been pre∣sented with an Essay upon the mentioned  Psalm  in which an Eye has been Every where kept to the  Sense  and  Dignity  of the Original rather than to its dead  Letter  I will publish it as a Proof That Nothing can be more unlike the Thoughts of  David  than what we sing as  His  in most of our Churches  I  NOW while my Heav'ntun'd Harp is rightly strung  Soar my wing'd Soul And let Thy GOD be  sung  Cloath'd  with  embodied  Light He reigns sublime  And  grasps Eternity  and governs  Time  From His fear'd  Wrath  the  Sun's  fierce Blaze retires  And dark Convulsions  shake  his sick'ning Fires  Conscious of  Beams  which dazzle  Nature  's Eye  And which but once to  View  were  then  to  die

Politicks  This Day's Entertainment shall be an Introduction to that Purpose which I shall occasionally pursue with the open Spirit of a PLAIN DEALER asserting and making free with All the  Liberty  I was  born to  A Liberty which does not alone in∣title us to a Property in our  Estates  but in our  Thoughts  also It is the great Charecte∣ristick of every Freeborn  Briton  That  He may speak as He thinks and think as He pleases  WHILE like the Provinces of the declin∣ing Empire of  Old Rome  we are fretting and disturbing ourselves under the Notion of  Reason  and  Principle  to support the factious Avarice of a few aspiring Men who find their Interest in our Divisions the  GOTHS are at  our Gate  and we are apprehensive of no  out∣ward  DangerThere seems to be rising near us That NORTHERN LYON which has so often been prophesied of And I believe in the Course of my Papers I shall make it sufficiently visible that if early Measures are not taken by Way of  Pre∣vention  against the threaten'd Evil the UNIVERSAL EMPIRE which  Spain  and  France  have successively alarm'd  Europe  with a fruitless Dread of seems in Reality to be coming upon us with all the Terrors of a  Fifth General Monarchy  IF it is suppos'd That such a Fear con∣cerns  Us  less than  other States  which may be thought to lie more expos'd I doubt we deceive Ourselves by a Vanity common to all Nations in overrating the  Hazard  of an Enemy who shou'd presume to invade usOur  Ships  powerful and numerous as they are are more formidable by the Re∣putation of their Terror than by the Danger of their Opposition For to expect that a  Fleet  will at all Times be able to keep Danger at a Distance were to give our  Pro∣tection  to the  Winds  How many  Caveats  against so unstable a Security cannot our own History furnish us withNeither ought it to be consider'd as a Remote or Chimerical Prospect  That we may be match'd in our Marine Pretensions  We cannot pos∣sibly have more Advantage in the Fame and Practice of Dominion at Sea against  any of our Cotemporary States than the  Carthaginians  had against the  Romans  And the Success which crown'd the Industry and unconquerable Spirit of these Last in De∣fiance of  all  Obstacles as well of  Nature  as of  Art  is a Lesson which may may teach our Statesmen That there is infinite Diffe∣rence between Things  difficult  and Things  impossible  NOT to insist on the memorable Sur∣prize with which  France  in a few Years Application convinc'd us with how little Reason we had indulg'd a Notion  That there were natural Impossibilities to prevent that Great Nation from becoming Powerful at Sea  All which were found mere Shadows when the Genius of her Ministers turn'd their Thoughts on attempting itThe prodi∣gious and enterprizing Spirit of the present  Czar  of  Russia  has at once establish'd in the  Baltick  a Third  Maritime  Power Supe∣riour to Both its old Ones And now while I am Writing has a Fleet of Sixty  Ships of the Line  besides  Frigates  and  Gallies  without Number  AS to  natural  Advantages whether for  building equipping  or  maintaining  a Navy this Prince has the Start of us beyond all ComparisonAnd since when his Ships are as  Many  and as  Strong  as ours which judging by what has been done already they may be in Three or Four Years our whole Pretence to Superiority must be plac'd in our  Skill  and  Experience  in SeaFights how dangerous wou'd the Consequence be found shou'd he hit upon some New Method of  improving his Vessels in their Strength De∣fensive or Offensive  Many High and Ardu∣ous Attempts toward which have busied some Years past the unresting Genius of that Monarch  WITHIN the Memory of Numbers yet living the  Muscovites  were consider'd as a People so far from  Dangerous  that they were even  Contemptible  And the precipitate Ad∣vance of their Reputation in Arms and Po∣licy is a Proof that no Vanity is more weak∣ly founded and unjust than the Common Practice of all Nations to esteem  Themselves  more  Valiant  than their  Neighbours  Man∣kind is every where the  same  by Nature till a  Difference  is produc'd by CustomWhat Nation  braver  than the  Persians  un∣der  Cyrus  Yet what Nation  baser  when they oppos'd the Arms of  Alexander  What People under Heaven have more in∣rich'd the Histories of former Ages than the Ancestors of those degenerate  Greeks  who are now the Disgrace of  Christendom Con∣tented Slaves  under a Tyranny a thousand Times more insupportable than the worst of Those in scorn of which their ancient Ora∣tors have fill'd the World with Noisy Decla∣mations in the boasted Cause of  Liberty ITALY  the imperious Mistress of the Uni∣verse has been  sunk  for many Ages and  parcell'd into petty and almost inconside∣rable  Jurisdictions  And to bring the Proof quite  Home  what People ever seem'd to hold a clearer Superiority over their Enemies than the  English  Armies which our  First Edward  led to War against the  Scots  And yet what Truth more undeniable than the shame∣ful  Cowardice  and downright  Baseness  of the Sons of those very  English  drawn out against the Sons of the same  Scots  in the next succeeding Reign of  Edward the Second  COURAGE when consider'd  nationally  is not the Effect of  Nature  but of  Discipline  Skill and Practice teaching an Agility in the Use of Arms excite a Pleasure in their Exercise And abating by Degrees that Fear of Death which is natural to all Men convert it into Hope of Victory and a proud and restless Thirst of Glory  Arms  there∣fore and a dexterous Superiority in the Use of them should be esteemed the  Sinews of War  and not MONEY as is commonly pretendedAn Army capable of  conque∣ring  will always find Means of  subsisting  But  Money  though it  subsists  an illdiscipli∣ned Army can never qualifie it for  conque∣ring  The Helpless  Indians  of  Mexico  were infinitely  Richer  than their Plunderersthe  Goths  when from that very Coun∣try which the  Czar  now governs they over∣ran and ruin'd  Europe  brought them only  Iron  they knew  That  would make them Masters of all the  Gold  they should have Occasion for  PRINCES whose Authority is absolute and uncontroll'd by  Privileges Rights  or  Customs  whose Dominions are vast and po∣pulous and whose Subjects are laborious hardy and obedient and acquainted with no  Learning  but what is sufficient to aid their Industry without inflaming their PrideSuch Princes become  dreadful  as soon as they appear  ambitious  and exert themselves in Pre∣parations for  War  But when it happens too that a Prince in so tempting a Situa∣tion has a Genius capable of  Improving  the ArtMilitary It is difficult to put  Limits  to the Consequences which may attend His Fortune  THO' the Study of the  Art of War  has been carried to a great Perfection yet there is Room enough left to give Scope to the Force of Genius this Way And it would perhaps be found upon Trial That the  Modern System  notwithstanding the Use of  Gunpowder  which was unknown to the An∣cients is as subject as the  old  was to be trampled on and overpower'd by some new and unforeseen  Discoveries  on those Sides most especially where we believe ourselves securest  THE  measur'd Lines  of Humane Foresight which are so proudly distinguished by the Name of  Policy  are vain Amusements and mere  Cobweb Subtleties  Their narrow busy Schemes of  balancing  the Power and Inte∣rests of Nations are often insufficient for the  Purposes of their Designers because these Highway Statesmen  found  their Maxims upon  Error in the first Concoction  The  Force  of a Prince is by their Rule to be calculated from his  Revenue  and his  Revenue  from the Wealth of his Subjects But This Argument depends intirely on the general  mistaken  Notion  That All Equal Numbers will be of Equal Weight in War  which is so far from being  true  That should the  Poorest  Prince in  Europe  fall upon the  Richest  with a Skill in Arms as much Superiour as He is  Infe∣riour  in his Numbers the Disparity would be  revers'd  immediately  THE  Romans  who never  conquer'd in order to prolong a War  but to make it bear its own Expences and encrease as well their  Treasury  as their  Reputation  were so far from this new Way of computing an Ene∣my's  Strength  by his  Riches  that Their Judgment was directly contrary And this Opinion of Ancient Times appears strongly in that magnanimous Answer which was given by a  Gaul  to a King of  Macedon  who shew'd him his Heaps of  Gold  in order to excite Terror and then ask'd him  What He thought of His Condition  The rugged Soldier reply'd sharply  That as to what con∣cern'd His Condition a Stranger could be no Judge But His  BOUNTY  He could perceive Extraordinarysince he had taken such un∣usual Pains to let his Enemies be convinc'd clearly That his Kingdom was worth their Conquering  WHERE a Prince is really  strong  To be held  Weak  in the Opinion of the World is rather a Benefit than a DisadvantageHis Preparations alarm no Body and the Blow he designs to strike will as soon be  felt  as  apprehended  Whereas the Fame of Power and Riches keeps Jealousy awake and attracts Envy and Opposition from all QuartersThe  Fortune  of the late  French  King had possibly kept Pace with his  Am∣bition  if it had not been watch'd and check'd upon this single ConsiderationOn the other Hand  Gustavus Adolphus  was so happily  despis'd  by the  Austrian Gran∣deur  which took it for granted according to the modern Reasoning  That the Poverty of such an Invader would be a Curb to his Courage  that boldly entring  Germany  with an Army of but  Seven Thousand Men  he carried every Thing before him like a Torrent broke the whole Scheme of the Emperor's Designs and had ruin'd in all Likelyhood the Inte∣rest of that Family if he had not been  kill'd  in the Battle of  Lutzen  DESIGNING in some future  Papers  to speak of Things a little out of the common Road and draw Conclusions which I judge too  new  to venture on without a previous Notice That I propose not to deduce my Arguments from the Principles of  Modern Politiques  and therefore refuse to be try'd by them I have for that Reason thought necessary to publish these few General Reflections as a Preparative for what I intend hereafter to consider in a more distinct and peculiar Manner  The Plain Dealer N  o    Quos EgoSed motos praestat componere fluctus  VIRG  Age si hic non insanit satis sua sponte instiga  TEREN AND  FRIDAY  December    WHILE I was preparing to make good my Promise in a late Paper con∣cerning the AFRICAN COMPANY I re∣ceiv'd the following Letter which has thrown me under a Necessity of Suspending the Exe∣cution of my Purpose 'till I can argue the LADIES into a Humour of Supporting the Burthen of something  very Grave  upon the Comfort of its having been preceeded by something that was  very Whimsical  Mr PLAIN DEALER  I HAVE been One of your  Female  Rea∣ders ever since your first Appearance and having begun to  take a Fancy  to you was much concern'd for your sake when I saw you venturing upon  African Stock  Take my Word for it You and I shall be  both Losers  Only I have lost  Money  And the PLAINDEALER will lose but  La∣bour  YOU may spare your self the Trouble of Instructing the  knowing  Gentlemen who manage our Affairs in that Country how to  get all that is to be gotten  And since  no more than All  can be hop'd for away with your  Schemes  to  improve Trade  and enable us to  improve Conversation  I re∣member a Story in one of your Papers of a Widow at  Wapping  that had brought over an  Elephant  from  Guinea  that cou'd dance  Moll Peatly Overturn Apple Baskets  and play a cleverer Circle of of Tricks than a whole Set of Managers put togetherI remember too there was a  Russian Bear  in the same Paper who came over to offer his Service among the  Italian Fidlers  of our Haymarket  Orchie∣stra  But was rejected as I since heard on the Remonstrance of some of their  Singers  That his Strokes were too  Mas∣culine  for their  Measure  Now never trust me if I was not a Thousand times more pleas'd with your Account of these two  wonderful Curiosities  than I am like to be with your expected  Essay  for the Im∣provement of our  African Traffick  BUT if you can prevail with the  Royal Company  to Trade in something which  we Women  may find our Interest in If in  their  Exports  for Example you cou'd in∣clude our Husbands and disagreeable Lovers And enrich the  Bills of Entry  with any Privileges Rights or Benefits  imported Customfree  for the Use of the SEX at home In this Case I cou'd read with Patience the most  profound  of your  Commercial Dissertations  and so might come in Time to get  Gravity  and  Breath  enough to peruse  one Moiety  of an  Act  of  Parliament  or begin and end a  Church History  I am in no small Terror and Apprehension  SIR  Yours at all Points proper  LAETITIA GAMBOL  AS there is nothing more easie than to satisfie the Demand of this  Lady  and I am naturally inclin'd to do every Thing in my Power to promote the  Pleasure  or  Interest  of the SEX I shall postpone what I mean to say further on the Improvement of that  Company's Trade  in  general  'till I have open'd a Prospect to this ungovernable Member of theirs Mrs LETTY GAMBOL of the many  Great  and  Glorious  Advantages which may be  imported  as she desires out of  Africa  to our  SeaPort Towns  and thence spread themselves in due Time over the Heart of this happy Kingdom for the Ease Emo∣lument  and Distinction of the  Women  its  best MANUFACTURE  I SHALL not confine my self to any single Part of  Africa  but boldly ransack that whole Continent for a Purpose so  Merito∣rious  It is the same Thing to me whe∣ther the Commodities I enquire after are the Products of  Wappo  of  Popo  or of  Ekke Tokki  Provided only That the  Goods  are as polite and elegant as the  Names  I shall  load  as willingly at  Boffow  or  Juffer  as at  Quaqua  Nor shall I make any Difference as to the Value I rate  Laudable Customs  at from the One's having been the Prerogative of a  Bossum  and the Other the Quality of an  Arompo  Note  An  Arompo  is a  ManEater  whence no doubt our  Engl  sh  Word  ROMP  A private Remark by the bye for the particular Use and Instruction of the Lively  Mrs Laetitia Gambol    THE Sable  Toasts  of those Sunny Climates have such  Choice  of Tempting Privileges that I shall have Room in this Paper to recommend but a very few of them I will therefore select the Best and begin with this ARCHCLAIM of  Virginity within the Tropicks  that Girls at Nine Years old commence  Women  THE  Young Ladies  too in most Places are at Liberty to dispose freely of what∣ever may be call'd  Their own  And when afterwards they think of  Marrying their  Credit  like that of other Traders is rated the  higher  by how much  wider  and more  publickly  They have carried on their  Dealing  I THINK no Doubt can arise concerning the Welcome with which  These Two valuable RIGHTS  will be receiv'd But not be∣ing  altogether so clear  in my Opinion con∣cerning the  following  I shall leave it to be weigh'd maturely How far it may be  of Use AMONG US  it is a  Privilege to retire from the Fatigue of Man's Society after having been Mothers of Ten Children  THE Antient  Tryal by bitter Waters  has been more generally heard of than ap∣prov'd among our  Women  here at home who if not perhaps the  Deepest  are un∣questionably the  prettiest Casuists  in the Universe But the Duskier Beauties of  Negroland  when under Accusations of  too much good Nature  have an Appeal to  sweeter Waters  in Justification of their Innocence For in order to discover to a jealous Hus∣band whether the Wife has been guilty or not she is thrown headlong into a River And if she  drowns  she was a  Sinner  But it is a Remark of great Consolation That there never was found a  Woman  who had not  Lightness enough to Swim  and escape the Malice of her Accusers  THERE is something too in their agree∣able Manner of  Mourning for the Death of a Husband  which deserves to be offer'd to the Consideration of the SEX in these more  Phlegmatick Northern  Regions And one wou'd wonder indeed how any thing  so extravagantly Polite  shou'd have got Footing among People who never Subscrib'd to an  Opera  The whole Term of such  Mourn∣ing  is included within  Fourteen Days  And the Ceremony consists of  Cries  which are modulated by the Tunes of Musical Instru∣ments and accommodated with a certain Equitable Dexterity to the Ease of the  Performer  and more lively Entertainment of the  Audience  by large intermediate  Pauses  during which they drink Brandy and smoke Tobacco 'till their  Spirits  are duly rais'd to expect when the Musick be∣gins again for  another Act  of the  Ob∣sequies  BUT above all their agreeable Customs I contemplate with most Reverence the vast Extent of their  Charity  There is in it an uncommon Profoundness and a Tenderness of Heart beyond ExampleIt is a Practice among the  Rich Negro Ladies  on the  Gold Coast  to give Orders on their Death Beds for buying up a Number of FemaleSlaves to bestow on the  Publick  as  Living Legacies  whose whole Business it is to be at Every Body's Ser∣vice  in One sole Employment  which they are All equally capable of for the Price of  Three PeriwincleShells  They consider This as a Work of great Mercy and Compassion and conscious of their  pious Purpose close their Eyes and die satisfied  I COU'D add an infinite Variety of such uncommon Commodities as These But the Foregoing will serve as  Samples  of what  Rich Goods  may be imported for the Uses which my Correspondent hints at if in Right of her self and the  Ladies  she acts for she cou'd propose any  Scheme  of  Engraftment  by vertue whereof the  Assistants  of the  Royal Company  might co∣operate with the  Sisterhood  IT is not to be question'd but when such a Scheme comes to be seen the Di∣rectors of some other of our more thriv∣ing  Societies  will  stir  against it out of Envy and propose their  own  respective  Bodies  as most Capable of or more adap∣ted to the mention'd  Incorporation  But the Ladies will I hope have Honour enough to  keep close  to their first Engraf∣ters And least their natural Disposition  to think too meanly of Themselves and their own Reasonings  should expose them with∣out Defence to the Force of Arguments they cannot Answer I will conclude this Essay for their Service with the Example of a ROYAL AFRICAN  His Majesty the King of  Boffoe who when his  Conscience  was a little puzzled brought himself off by his  Resolution  KING  Yagou  the abovemeant was a Lover of the Female Sex but being a Prince of great Frugality  contented  him∣self with  Ten Wives only  when many of his Subjects had  Forty  and out of that small Number of Ten would now and then for mere Good Husbandry bestow  One  on his Son  Joost  A  Portu∣gueze Fryar  to whom he was boasting of these Great Qualities represented to him the  Wickedness  of the Action and assured him That no  civiliz'd  Part of the World allow'd itAt which he laugh'd very heartily and return'd him this Answer  Must I be a Fool because the White Men of your Country are FoolsMy People are better inform'dand we act in both Places according to our different Under∣standings  The Plain Dealer No  Misce stultitiam Consiliis brevem  HOR  MONDAY  December    I REMEMBER a Passage in some  Eastern  Writer which carries a sharp and instru∣ctive Moral An  Emir  of great Sanctity had a Custom every Night to call his Fa∣mily together that they might sit round him with due Gravity to hear his Son read some Chapter of the  Alcoran  which the Fa∣ther would take Pleasure in opening and en∣larging on to his Domestick Congregation It happened one Night that in the midst of the Sermon the whole Audience  fell asleep  except the Preacher and his Son Which last assoon as he observ'd it inter∣rupted his Father with this Remark  See Sir the Fruits of your Good Purpose There is not one of them All but sleeps as soundly as if God's Word deserv'd no Reverence  The  Emir  look'd round the Company and shutting up his  Spectacles  in the Book against a fitter Opportunity drew his Discourse to a  Conclusion with this Reply to his Son's In∣telligence  You had your self been better employ'd in adding One to the Number of Sleep∣ers than in waking not so much to correct your own Faults as to observe the Faults of Others  I receiv'd a Letter the other Day which brought this Story to my Remembrance and is one Proof among many how difficult a Province he undertakes who assumes the Office of a PLAIN DEALER at a Time when People are so  vigorous  in the Censures which they make  Themselves  and so  languid  in their Approbation of Those which others make with the same Liberty  The Author of this Letter is so kind as to let me know  "He is one of my  Best Friends  he will not therefore insist on my Disingenuity to  fall foul of  a single Sen∣tencein one of my late Papers and  dwell on one Error  in a voluminous Au∣thor But he is so good as to be in Pain for my  Veracity  having carefully he says examin'd every single Paragraph of  Mr  Trapp's  Preface to his Translation of  Vir∣gil and not being able to discover what I charge him withHe closes all with a Hint that he writes in Vindication of that worthy and Reverend Author and would not have Offence taken  at every Trifle  "  THE VERACITY of the PLAIN DEALER being the Side he will be sure  to be most defensible on it was unskilfully done for a  Lover of the Muses  as my Cor∣respondent subscribes himself to bring on his Attack so rashly on that QuarterHe ought first to have been very careful and confirm'd in his  Discoveries  But to re∣move the  Cloud  from his Sight if he pleases to turn to  Page  of the first Volume of the mention'd Translation in an  Essay on moving the Passions  previous to the Remarks on the th Book he will find a Paragraph ended thus  We have notasyetin∣deedcompleted the Explication propos'dFor somethingmorestillremainsbe∣hind  If this differs from what it appear'd in my Paper it is only by being a little  worse  than I made it  THUS much to the  Charge  in that only Part which carried any  Appearance  of Rea∣son with itThe other Articles have no Weight at all but from the Regard that is due to a  mistaken GoodNature  which has misled the Gentleman whoever he was to apprehend as a  Trifle  an Error of the first Magnitude in WritingIt is certainly the Business and the  Aim  of every Author to  explain  and  illustrate  his Argument But this tedious Redundance obscures and perplexes itWhere a Man should  imprint  Idea's he distracts and  erazes  them And instead of awakening the Passions affects the Spirits with DrowsinessSuch a  TRIFLE  is this Fault which my Correspondent is for  passing over with so tenderhearted a Blind∣ness  THE censur'd Passage then is no Error of such  small Importance  as the Animadver∣tor had thought fit to imagine but he falls next into another Mistake of considering it as a Place pick'd out by the Inquisition of a malicious Eye Whereas if he had been as attentive to the  Argument  of the Paper where he found that Censure as he was to the  Censure Itself  nothing would have been more easy than to have observ'd  Numbers of the same Kind  of  Amplifications  which might with equal Effect have been borrow'd from that work And thence he must have drawn this natural and obvious ConclusionThat  one Error only was dwelt on  not be∣cause it was all that could be found but be∣cause it was all that could be admitted in that Paper  AS to the  Worthiness  or  Reverence  of the Author the LetterWriter himself can wish no less Ill to him than the PLAIN DEALER does But this is a Matter en∣tirely out of the Question The  Person  has no∣thing to do where what he has  written  and  published  is the Ground of the ArgumentFor a  Friend  Partiality is  Weakness  And against an  Enemy  it is  Baseness  The Merit of a Cause lies above the Level of such low Motives and they who would reach it as they ought must be listed in their Attempt between  Justice  and  Resolution  There is  nothing which the PLAIN DEALER has a sincerer Detestation of than Personal Re∣proach or Defamation But then on the other side he who dares not speak out openly whenever Occasion offers it self concerning the Miscarriages of the Greatest Men or the Vertues of the most Unprosperous has a Soul below the Duties of one who  writes that he may deserve Reading  BUT to make a Transition to a Subject which I have for some Time in vain been expecting an Opportunity to  resume  with a Spirit less  ludicrous  than That in which I touch'd it not long since I am rais'd to such a Height of Wonders by the trium∣phant  Posture  in which the  Wit  of this Ge∣neration is visible almost every Night at one or other of our Theatres in the Genius of our Actors  Limbs  that there is nothing which I cannot promise my self from the Readiness of their  Elastick Capacity  and the Humour which the Town is in of  listning  to the  Voice  of their  Muscles  I HAVE noted for this Reason what I discovered not without due Transport as I was perusing a certain  Venerable  HIGH GER∣MAN Compiler  CAMERARIUS his Hi∣storical Meditations  It is a new and un∣broken  Mine  of  Theatrical Treasure  which I shall recommend with the stronger Hope to the Contention of our Rival Stages be∣cause the nevertobeforgotten the Trium∣phant  FAUSTUS HIMSELF  was of Happy  High German  Original  I HAVE oftentimes says this Grave and Authentick Sage for I reverence him too much to vary a Word from his Text  seen with wondering  in the Prince of  Bamberg  his Court a certain Peasant of  Germany  nourished and brought up as himself avouched in the Mountains  among Beasts  who was so active and nimble of his Bo∣dy that all that saw him were  astounded  and thought he used  Enchantment  which yet  I do not verily think he did  And that which was most remarkable in him was That he shewed his Agility  not stand∣ing but walking upon his Hands and his Feet prone and flatback'd like a Dog or a Cat  IN that same Court was a  Dwarf  who would  get up upon  this Peasant as upon a Horse making him to turn and wind all manner of Ways as a Rider would do a  Spanish Genet  But when the  Peasant listed  he wou'd easily  throw his Dwarf  for all that ever he could do to sit fastSometimes he was  baited  with  very mighty Mastives  and with  English Dogs  that the Prince had And by a certain  Barking  which he counterfeited naturally and a  furious snarling like a Dog  would give them the Chase and make them run apace out of the HallThat done he would set himself to  leap  upon his Hands and Feet forwards and backwards with a  Nimbleness incredible  and would  scramble up by the Coines  towards the Roof of the Hall faster than an  Ape  could do albeit otherwise he was a  rustical Fellow heavy  and of a  gross making  I SAW him twice as I was at the Prince's Table after he had thrown his Dwarf and driven away all the Dogs that were in the Room leap upon the Shoulders of one of the Guests and thence upon the Table without overturning  Dish  or  Cup  And then cast himself with such a  Spring  up∣on the Floor that one would have said  It  had been a  Squirrel  or some  wild Cat  He did use to skip as fast upon the Tops of Towers and of Houses built Pointwise as our HouseCats would do And so ma∣ny other PARTS of a  Cat  and an  Ape  HE PLAYED that  his Tricks were the Talk and the Wonder of all Men  I WAS so pleas'd with this Fancy that I could not forbear communicating it for the future Entertainment of our  People of Fashi∣on  And I am so firmly convinc'd of the imi∣tative Spirit and Genius of the Hostile  Har∣lequins  of the  Two Comic Houses  that I que∣stion not in the least but by the Second Week after  Christmas  we shall see a Dozen or two of BullDogs round the Tail of  Shep∣herd  on  DruryLaneStage  without being able to  bite him  while he  curvets  and  barks  with his  Back up  and wheels safe in  their  Center  And Mr  LUN  at the other House crawling up the Edge of one of his Scenes and  sticking to the Roof like a Spider  over the Heads of a  shouting Pit  where he will  spin  himself into their good Graces 'till their Necks are half broke with the  Subli∣mity  of their Entertainment  The Plain Dealer N  o    Quo me cunque rapit Tempestas deferor Hospes  HOR  FRIDAY  December    LIKE a Ship that is compell'd by Tem∣pest to decline from her due Course I am sometimes driven out of my Way by the Letters of my Correspondents None of which beat so violently upon me as Those from the  Feminine Quarter  I BEGIN to find it Impracticable to work any Good on that perverse and malapert Sex by the  Weight  of  Age  and  Experience  If I had not confess'd at my first setting out that I was then in my  Grand Clima∣cterick  I am verily persuaded I might have  apply'd my

new Intelligence brought me of their  persisting  in Mischiefs and Enormities which reach and involve all Men from the  Canopy  to the  Cottage  THE Epistles which this Paper shall be fill'd with will

FAIR without considering what  Vertues  They whom they love are possess'd ofLet me give them through your Means the following  true  Relation  Olivia  is a Lady of genteel and fashio∣nable Education for her Mother took early Care to  shew her the World  as they call it That is To teach her through the most contrary  Appearances  to intend No∣thing but her  Pleasure  and  InterestPamphilio  is a Gentleman of good Estate in the NeighbourhoodThe Lady's Re∣putation was unsullied He saw her often and every Time he saw her saw new Marks of her Wit and Good Humour her Freedom and Sincerity 'till from  ad∣miring  he fell to  adoring  her  HIS Love was inflam'd by the little innocent Encouragements which  Olivia  knew how to give without incurring the Imputation of  Forwardness  and which  Pamphilio  regarded as so many modest Overtures to the Advantage of his PassionHis Visits were more frequent and more open He could no longer conceal his Love he declar'd it at once to both  Olivia  and her Motherfor her  Father  was dead And they Both gave him Hope of succeeding in his Wishes  Pamphilio  's Affection growing stronger and stronger he became impatient for their Marriage in the near Prospect of which all the Neighbourhood rejoyc'd and did their Utmost to advance it For they observ'd how his Soul  doated  on her and darted it∣self into his  Eyes  whenever she approach'd him  Olivia  declin'd marryingShe was too young she said to be Mistress of a Family and insisted on a  Year more  in which she might fix her ResolutionTho' this  Year  to  Pamphilio  was a  Lover's Eternity  he was to submit on any Terms and the Time requir'd by  Olivia  at last drew near its ConclusionThe Lady then grew  cooler  and the Lover  more transported  She declar'd to him very frankly That  It was impossible for her to love him  Neither  Love  she said nor  Hatred were Things in our own Power And he ought not to take it ill that she cou'd no longer deceive him  POOR  Pamphilio  had no Voice to  reply  But a sudden  Tear  or two  spoke for him  He trembled grew pale and gaz'd on herand sigh'd at length this faint Hope  That she cou'd not sure be in Ear∣nest  She answered  He had no Reason to give himself the Air of so much SurprizeShe had never promis'd him Marriage  and was yet at her own DisposalPam∣philio  bow'd and left her and has also left  Society  He shuns all his former Companions And is sunk in the deepest Melancholy His Affairs are neglected his Health is destroy'd and his Friends are enrag'd and astonish'd  ABOUT a Quarter of a Year ago  Olivia  was  married  and with so extraordinary a Success that her Relations are already upon suing out a  Divorce  What ought to ren∣der the Condition of this Lady  Inconsolable  if she has either Generosity or Reflection isThat  Her  hard Fortune afflicts  Pam∣philio  to a sharper Degree than  His own  did  SUCH a  Jilting  Temper may perhaps be consistent with  Chastity  but it can have neither  Honour  nor  Tenderness  She was form'd to inspire Love and very capable of it by  Nature  But she was harden'd by  Education  to become  unsusceptible  of itShe expos'd Charms to Sale which she intended not to part with And then like a covetous Tradesman who has lost his best Market she resolv'd as a pretty Revenge  to throw herself away upon the First Bidder  Yours  PAMPHILIOPHILUS  The Plain Dealer No  Incertam frustra Mortales funeris horam  Quaeritis  PROPERT  Tum vero in curas Animum diducimus omnes  HOR  MONDAY  December    I NEVER met with any Accident which more touchingly surpriz'd me than the Death of my Friend Sir  Portly Rufus  under Circumstances with Regard to his Fortune much inferior to the Figure he had maintain'd in the World and which made such Impres∣sions on his departing Soul as serv'd at once to excite my Pity and inflame my Admiration  I VISITED him during his Sickness and found his Family in great Disorder The chearful Faces which were formerly worn by his Servants as the lively Signals of his Hospitality were quench'd and sadden'd by a Sorrow that prov'd its  Deepness  by its  Silence  He was fallen into a forc'd Sleep  when I came down to his House in the Coun∣try and it being late in the Evening I went to Bed with a Resolution not to disturb him 'till the MorningI lay awake and heard the Clock strike  One  indulging my Thoughts under the Solemnity of the Midnight Dark∣ness with a Thousand busy Reflections on the Instability of our Health and Pleasures when from an Old Tower of the ParishChurch which was almost contiguous to my ChamberWindow I heard the  Toll  of a Great Bell sound out many Times distinct∣ly with a deep and mournful Fullness which left an unusual Vibration in the Air and had scarce ceas'd when I found the whole Family alarm'd and the House fill'd with  Shriekings  and the most distracted Cries of Sorrow  I ROSE and dress'd my self in much Amazement and following the Clamour found it collected in the Sick Man's Cham∣berI was assur'd at the crowded En∣trance That  Sir Portly was a Dying Man  That  the Bell which had toll'd out at Mid∣night always did so of it's self before every Death that was to happen in the Family  That  it was a Warning which had never fail'd  And That  Sir Portly who had been wak'd by the Sound of it was himself of the Opini∣on That he could live but a few Hours  I FOUND my Friend sitting up in his Bed very faint and scarce able to speak and looking round him with a Mixture of Wildness and of Sorrow on the Distraction  of his Assembled FamilyAs soon as he saw me near him He gave me his Hand with a Glimpse of Chearfulness which seem'd to brighten through his Anguish And in∣sisting with much Earnestness That I should be left for some Time alone with him the rest withdrew and I sat near him on the BedsideHe continued silent for several Minutes fixing his Eyes on me very sted∣fastly and with much inward Commotion till at last he spoke to me as follows  YOU have tim'd this Visit kindly for it is the Last you will ever make me It is a sensible Comfort that I have this Op∣portunity to communicate my dying Senti∣ments to a Friend who will be capable of doing me Justice where the World may speak of me with a mistaking Liberty  HERE he put a Key into my Hand and di∣rected me to find a Paper which I have now in my Possession and from the Subject of which I shall take Occasion some Time hereafter to draw more Observations than One for the Use of Men of Business who may receive Entertainment and Advantage from itHe said something concerning his Private Affairs in which my Advice he be∣liev'd might be of Service to his Family And then assum'd a Discourse on the  Toll∣ing of the Parish Bell  and proceeded in it with much Composure  I HAVE neither Learning  said he  nor Leisure to enter upon an Examination concerning the  Causes  of these  PraeterNa∣tural Notices  It is enough for me that  It is thus  And you will soon be convinc'd of the Consequence with Regard to my ap∣proaching EndBut Let not any Thing so common as  Death  be an Affliction or Surprize to you I have enjoy'd my Bed of  Sickness  like a  Study  It has given me an Opportunity of retiring into my self without Partiality or InterruptionThe Danger of my Condition drew a Curtain betwixt the World and me and contra∣cted all my Business into the Compass of this silent Chamber Here I have seen Things  as they are  and learnt to judge of them without Prejudice  TO  forsake the World  gives me no Pain from any Attachment to its Pleasures It can tempt me with Nothing  New  for I have already seen it allThough I die as I shall to Night  Tomorrow  will be like to  Today  The same  Sun  will rise up∣on it and leave it in the same DarknessThe Seasons will come round again and be  call'd New  but they will be no other than the Repetition of what I have so often beheld alreadyWhy should it startle me to be call'd back to the Place from which I came hither I rose from Uncertainty into Life and I am now but returning out of Life into Uncertainty Can any Thing  be more reasonable than that  Others  ha∣ving given Place to  Me  I should give Place to others in my TurnEither I have not made the proper  Use  of  Life  which I have enjoy'd so long already and therefore de∣serve to hold it no longer Or having reap'd the Profit of Living to what End should I wish Life lengthen'd  I HAVE many Hopes 'tis true which it grieves my Soul to leave imperfect But if I would live 'till I am  compleatly Happy  I seek what is never to be found It were to act like those foolish  Indians  who run themselves out of Breath to  catch the Sun  when it seems to  set so near them  So might I travel on  for ever  and weary my self to no Purpose The Object of my Pursuit is not in the same World where I am  YET there is one Thing which makes Death  terrible  and triumphs over Reason Reflexion and Philosophy It is That we are torn from our  Friend's Society  That we are divided by perhaps an  Everlast∣ing  Separation from what  Love  has made  dearer  to us than our  Life  is It is that BlendingThat Liquefactionor Con∣fusion of Two Hearts in one Will De∣sire and Interest which is the  Spirit  of all human Blessings Light is Darkness with∣out it and Prosperity  not enjoy'd  but  pos∣sess'd  without Relish  IN this View of our Soul's Union here on Earth with some kindred Spirit which it delights to mingle with Death is  dread∣ful  when it strikes between usHow many unfinish'd Purposes may it interpose it self to the Disappointment of with Re∣gard to the Comfort or Service of Those who are thus  Dear  to us when we are cut off by a sudden Summons and allow'd no Time to compleat our yet but intentional Gratitude or give Perfection to our unri∣pen'd Labours Can a  Husband  sit Easie  within  when he is straining his dying Eyes for the last afflicting Sight of a Wise who deserv'd his Tenderness and was intitled to his Protection but whom he is that Mo∣ment compell'd to leave to struggle with the Bitterness of  Want  and acquaint her∣self with the Licentiousness of Reproach Contempt and InsultOr can there be a Strength in Wisdom to sustain a dying  Father  whose Heart is tortur'd with the burning Uncertainty of what shall become of his helpless Children expos'd Orphans to an unpitying World without Guide Support or Prospect  HERE my Friend was interrupted by the Impatience of his Family who broke in up∣on us with a Grief which soon appear'd to have too just a Ground For  Sir Portly  died in less than a quarter of an Hour afterThere were many Circumstances in the Man∣ner  of his Death which will deserve to be describ'd in a future Paper But the melan∣choly Impression they have left me under will at present be best indulg'd by an Ab∣stract of some Excellent Verses from a POEM of  Mrs ELIZABETH SINGER  's  on the Death of Her Husband  I am not sure that I remember them right for it is long since I read them But there is so much of  Beauty Nature  and  Passion  in them that the Reader cannot fail to discern and ad∣mire the Author's Genius through what∣ever Injury they may have suffer'd by any Injustice I may perhaps have done them  IN what soft Language shall my Thoughts break free  My dear  Alexis  when I talk of  Thee    Nor  Nymph  nor  Grace  of all the fancied Train  Nor  weeping Loves  shall aid my pensive Strain  True Passion has a Force too strong for  Art  She needs  no Muse  who can invoke her  Heart  Tasteless of  Forms  and from all Comfort torn  The  HusbandLover  and the  Friend  I mourn  All that to Worth and Tenderness was due  Whate'er Excess the fondest Passion knew  I felt  My Pray'rs to  Heav'n  were All for  Thee  And  Love  inspir'd me first with  Piety  Oh Thou wert all my Triumph and my Pride  My Hope my Peace my Shelter and my Guide  Thy Love  sweet Study busied all my Days  And my full Soul's Ambition was  Thy Praise    Why has my Heart this fond Engagement known  Or why wou'd Heav'n dissolve the Tye so soon  Whence had the Charmer all his  Power to move    Or why was all my Breast so  turn'd  for  Love  Oh he cou'd  talk  'Twas  Extasie  to  hear  The  list'ning Soul  hung trembling on the  Ear  Musick's whole Power dwelt artless on his Tongue  Awefully soft  like some kind Angel's Song  Pain  that but heard  Him  speak was charm'd to  Rest    And  Mercy  melted down the  Miser  's Breast  Hours Days and Years unheeded took their Flight  For  Time  was only measur'd by  Delight  Fancy still paints him fresh in every Grace  But the thin Shade eludes my lost Embrace  The shrinking Vision melts in shapeless Night  And a cold Horror blots my blasted Sight  Then the past Mis'ery rises to my View  His  Death  sad Scene will be for ever  New  Then  with the quickest Sense his Pangs I feel  And his  Last Accents  o'er my  Silence  steal  "My  Wife  my sharpest Pain my fondest Care  "Heav'en for  Thy Sake  will hear a  Dying Pray'er  "Will  lead  and  comfort  Thee when I am  dead  "When from these aking Eyes thy Form is fled  "When these cold Hands which now thy Grasp implore  "Shall tremble at the Touch of Thine no more  "Oh where shall my

HOR  FRIDAY  December    IT has been justly observ'd by our Wri∣ters in Defence of the  Stage  That  It is a  GLASS  in which we see what we our∣selves are by the Image of our own Actions represented in the Persons of Others  Commend me then to the Wit or the Satire of one of our Theatres where they have brought  Newgate  into their  Mirrour  and taught our People of Quality the elegant Art of  breaking Jayl  by Way of Diversion and Improvement  TO Treat this Subject if possible with some Appearance of  Gravity  either the Taste of our Audiences must be depraved to a Degree of Horror or the Judgment of our MasterPlayers corrupted to a Degree of PityToo long indeed have the most Successful of our Theatrical Entertainments been  Low  and  Contemptible  but I never ob∣serv'd before That they were  Ungenerous  and  Inhumane  What Idea will Posterity conceive of the Present Age when they shall read among a thousand living Records to our Infamy That our Nobility and Peo∣ple of the First Figure in Life cou'd de∣scend to be Partakers in an Insult offered to the Memory and Misfortune of a poor Wretch a  Felon  who had just before been Executed at  Tyburn  by sitting contented Spectators to observe his Crimes and his Miseries acted over again for their Delight and Instruction  BUT If as  Lucan  says of  Nero  the Gods cou'd make Way for  CAESAR  by no other Means than those dreadful Things which  preceded  himIf  Nothing less  cou'd induce the Town to bear with the insup∣portable  CAESAR in AEGYPT  than their acting it immediately after SHEPHERD  in  NEWGATE the Players have at least  One  Good Argument for permitting itThey made Way too for a  Brother's Tragedy  whose tender Heart might have been broke if he had  twice write dismally  to no Pur∣pose  King JOHN  the Dramatick  Abor∣tive  of last Winter was a pusillanimous Prince and cou'd condescend to hear Rea∣sons why it was necessary to submit for Fear of  a forcible Deposing  But  CAESAR  was a  Hero  and too  resolv'd  to shake at  Danger  Tho' all the Serpents of  Africa  shou'd have  hiss'd in his Face  he would have regarded them as little  as he did the  Boxes  the  Pit  and the  Gallery  THIS Tragedy is so provoking and co∣pious a Field for Satire that it is with Diffi∣culy I restrain my Pen from the severest Licence of just  Invectives  But I soften my Indignation when I turn my Eye from the Play to the  Author  The Exemplary  Candor Humanity Politeness Affability  and  Generosity  of that Gentleman's indulgent Behaviour with Regard to the Works and Interest of other Writers But  above all his prodigious Modesty  These his extraordinary and wellknown Virtues overbalance a thousand Absurdities in his Tragedy and determine me to continue silent  THE  Theatre  to confess the Truth is a Subject of too much  Consequence  from its Effect on the Morals and Behaviour of the  Publick  to leave it either decent or reason∣able to omit Defects in the Stage's Constitu∣tion and descend to the Actor's particular FailingsBut we have Persons on the Stage who want not some  Graces  and Ge∣nerous Qualities as well of Body as of Mind which might have  adorn'd  even the Best of those Characters which they are ac∣custom'd to represent And of These I shall speak seriously and with Pleasure on Occa∣sions which will offer themselves when I come in a little Time to consider the  Pre∣sent State of our Stage  and what Justice there may be in those Pretences to its  Im∣provement  which we have heard so very much of under its Management as it now stands  BUT TO return to my first Subject There have not been wanting publick Marks of Disapprobation as often as those illcho∣sen Entertainments abovementioned have been exhibited Yet they  went on with an unmoveable Steadiness of Resolution  which in a Cause the  Reverse  of theirs might de∣serve to be call'd a  Virtue  and even as the Case really stands it is an  Accomplishment very new and Extraordinary  and must be allow'd not unworthy of the  highest Admi∣ration  That heroic  Roman  Spirit which  Horace  speaks of in the Motto to my PAPER went no farther than a private applauding himself at home in Return for the  Hisses  which he met with when abroad But our  English  Firmness of Face can  look Reproach in the Teeth  and persevere with as much Negligence and Satisfaction as if we suf∣fer'd for our  Excess of Wit  what is levell'd at our  Want of Judgment  I WAS favour'd many Months since with a Sheet or Two of Excellent Reflexions which were lost by some Accident and have been but lately recover'd The follow∣ing Observations seem so applicable to my present Purpose that I cannot do better than borrow them for Reproof of a barbarous Custom which had spread itself  too broad  among us before it appear'd on one of our  Theatres  AT  Paris  and at  Amsterdam  there is scarce a Week passes without some  Publick Execution  and yet tho' there are  NewsPapers  in Abundance we seldom or never find any Account of that Sort in themThey think and perhaps justly enough That it is a Point of National Credit to conceal with as much Decency as they can the Enormities of their CountrymenOn the contrary our Writers for the  Day  and the  Week  watch with Earnestness for the Op∣portunity and are sure to pass by no such SubjectIt often makes a very Glaring  Paragraph  but is sometimes unhappily sci∣tuated I have frequently known a  Change at Court  yok'd with a  Remove at Tyburn  and both follow'd close in the Rear by an Account of some  ChurchAdvancement  or newdrawn  Matrimonial Tye  among People of Quality  I ONLY hint at these Liberties and de∣sire to deal gently with my Contempora∣riesThere are other Wretches among us who attend the  Gibbet  like Ravens or Vul∣tures and expect their  Subsistence  from itNot a poor Criminal can be hang'd but they break open his expiring Lips and rob him of his  Last Words  When he has suffer'd the Sentence of the  Law  he is condemn'd afresh to a  Libel  And is far from be∣ing  at Rest  even after he has surrender'd his Life to the Halter his Cloaths to the Hangman and his Body to the Sur∣geons  For then come the Scribler the Pamphleteer and the  Biographer  of  New∣gate  who  draw  out his Good Name and  quarter  it and hang up his Reputation in  Effigie  They give him a  Quarto  or an  Octavo  Shrowd and fringe and flourish it with his  Birth  and  Parentage  Hence the  Ordinary  to preserve his  Perquisites  is driven upon the Necessity of  advertising against Counterfeits  and has sometimes no better Expedient than to publish the  Posthumous Works  of his Communicants  even before they are yet departed  TO be  halfhang'd  has been the Case of one or two Sufferers but to be  twice hang'd  is a very great Hardship And when a Cri∣minal's Account of  Himself  is suppos'd to be  true  it seems a Mifortune that They who wilfully  belye  him should be permit∣ted to survive himIf the Sufferer can write and read then besides his  Birth  and  Education  his  Tryal  and  Confession  we have  his Last Works and Compositions  If he is married we have  his Widow's Lamen∣tation  If he dies troubled and unsa∣tisfied we have  his Ghost  And if his Life has been at all remarkable we have  His History and Adventures  Some ready Compiler of  Newgate  bundles up his  Me∣moirs  and describes his Exploits in so dis∣creet and adapted Style That the Plea∣santry of the Relation is more apt to prevail  on the  Young  and the  Giddy  who are the common Readers of such Tracts to  imitate  a Life of so much seeming Heroick Extra∣vagance than to take Example from the fatal End of it  I KNOW not whether such  Exposing  Me∣thods as These are not suffer'd to take Place by Way of Advance upon the Lenity of our  English Executions  and as a Counterballance to the Foreign Severities of  Torture  and  Mu∣tilation  If there is any such Depth of Poli∣tick Refinement in the Indulgence which is shewn this Practice the  Dead  feel nothing that relates to them and the  Living  I am perswaded are very little the better for such  Paper Executions  But of  This  I can ven∣ture to be positive That should some Drudge for the Bookseller's Benefit make a  Collecti∣on of all Works of this kind  and some mer∣cenary Translator dress it out in a Foreign Language our Neighbours and our Poste∣rity might be tempted to believe That the present Generation of  Englishmen  were  a Na∣tion of Thieves and Pickpockets  The Plain Dealer No  Diversos diversa juvant non omnibus  Omnia conveniunt  GAL ELEG  MONDAY  December    IT is a Rule in Conversation that he who keeps all the  Talk  to himself never pleases so much as one who  listens  in his Turn to what is said by the rest of the CompanyThe same Observation will hold good with Regard to such a Paper as the PLAIN DEALER I must sometimes fall civily back and give Way to my Corre∣spondents or I shall incur the Reproach of Writing rather to entertain  Myself  than to delight or oblige my Readers  Mr  PLAINDEALER  I HAVE such a Veneration for the FAIR that I am sorry I shou'd have Occa∣sion to exhibit any Complaint against them but I am once a Week so whimsically treated by some of them that I am re∣solv'd to  speak out and spare not  THERE are many young Ladies and what is worse many old Ladies within the Bills of Mortality that every  Satur∣day  while their Houses are cleaning take a Fancy to have Business with  Me  for no other Reason in the World but because they can't tell how else to dispose of them∣selvesFor you must know That I am a  Mercer  They swim into my Shop by Shoals not with the least Intention to  buy  but only to hear my Silks  rustle  and fill up their own  Leisure  by putting  Me  into full  Employment  So they tumble over my Goods and deafen me with a Round of Questions 'till having found nothing in my Shop  to their Fancy  as they call it they toss themselves again into their Coaches and  drive on the Persecution  to the Terror and Disturbance of most of the honest Shop∣keepers from one End of the Town to the other  LAST  Saturday  was three Weeks at Two in the Afternoon I sent out my Servant to watch a Couple of these  Silken Strollers  and keep if possible within  Ken  of them They  undress'd  about a Dozen Shops with∣out stripping themselves of a single Shil∣ling and at six my Man return'd out of Breath and told me That he had left them cheapening Sugars beyond  NortonFalgate  But presently they came back and saw my next Neighbour a  LinenDra∣per  at his Door They pull'd their Coach∣man  by the Thumb and broke in upon my Friend and Acquaintance tho' his Shop was shut up and emptyThey had be∣thought themselves that  they must see some Cambricks  My Neighbour  knew  them for they were his Customers of five Years stan∣ding during all which Time he had never taken any of their MoneyBut they had done him the Honour to lean over his Counter find Fault with every Thing he cou'd shew them Exclaim at his  fright∣ful Prices  and make it a Rule with them  To bid Nothing  He turn'd over his whole Variety of Cambricks and had the unex∣pected GoodFortune after the prettiest Doubtings and Hesitations in the World to fix their Determination for they pitch'd upon a particular Piece about half an Hour past Seven and order'd him to  cut off enough for a Tucker  The worst of all This is That these un∣profitable  Wayward Visiters  keep BuyingCustomers out of our ShopsPray Mr PLAINDEALER reprimand them  for the Good of Trade  and the Ease and Deli∣verance of  Your afflicted Corespondent  J H  SIR  A GREAT many useful Lectures were levell'd heretofore against the En∣ormities of certain Fashions which had  taken Possession of the Female WorldThe Reduction of the  Stays  The Exal∣tation of the  Petticoat  and the Light∣ness and the Transparency of the  Modesty Peice  as that SEX had peceluiar Views in each of these Modes have been Topicks for Admonition and StatureThe LADIES have even been told That the obsolete Re∣liques of their GreatGrandmother's Scarecrow Wardrobes were less Fantastical than the  modern Whimsies  But those wholesome Severities suffer'd the Comon Fate of such Good Purposes  They diverted for a Week and were forgotten  ALL Arguments which would be suc∣cessful must adapt themselves to the  Un∣derstanding  of those in whom they expect to operateThe WIT of a Woman is her  Dress  To  move genteely  is her JUDGMENT And to  Govern herself with full Freedom  is her BIRTH RIGHT as an  English Sub∣ject  who renounces and protests against all absolute and unlimited Monarchy  BUT pray whisper if you dare to these pretty  FreeThinkers  That there is a a Country in the World call'd  Turkey  where Women are secur'd against the Dan∣ger of  Sunburning  by being kept out of the  open Air  and lock'd up like  other Jewels  in Places where no  Mischief  can reach 'emA SideGlance once a Year from a Window or an imperfect RandomShot through the  Hedge  of a  Gauze Muf∣fler  is the utmost Danger a Man can be expos'd to in those safe and silent Regions where they have an unaccountable savage Notion That  there is Temptation in a Wo∣man's Eye and that it is possible for a Pretty Fellow to stare himself into Fornication  A LITTLE private  Rumination  on such laudable Customs as These may have In∣fluence perhaps to moderate some of our Fine Ladies  wellbred Exorbitancies  If not we have at least this Remedy It is but  to turn Turks  and we new model our System of Government with Regard to this  Female Freedom  Such a Resolution wou'd furnish Business not at all disagree∣able to  Your most humble Servant  The Black EUNUCH  Mr  PLAIN DEALER  ORACLES have been deliver'd in Dreams and I see no Reason why Truth may not be as well  nodded  over by us Moderns as by the much more wake∣ful AncientsOur Senses being too gross and our Minds too much prejudic'd to re∣ceive Truth for its own sake it must ap∣proach us  obliquely  that being couch'd under sensible Representations it may be brought nearer to our View and make its Way into our Apprehension  UPON this Account therefore not to keep you in Suspence any longer least you may think me  dreaming already  I have sent you my last Night's Vision which if it meets with your Approbation may en∣courage me to close my Eyes again for I am both  sleeping  and  waking  Your constant Admirer  EUGENIO  AFTER having reflected on my Mi∣stress and on Marriage I fell asleep and found my self in a  Myrtle Grove  where several  Ways  ran together into one Great Path that led to the  Temple of Hy∣men  The Flowers most of which were  Violets  and  bleeding Lovers  exhal'd a deli∣cious Odour And the Birds that warbled round me help'd to fill the Scene with Transport  I OBSERV'D Crowds of Travellers pas∣sing onward but none to my great Sur∣prize  repassing  Upon looking a little nearer I discover'd Troops of flying Boys with Silver Wings that hover'd before them for their  Guides  There were Per∣sons of all Ranks and of both Sexes  I TOOK particular Notice of some who tho' they seem'd to make more Haste then the rest were at the End the farthest behindhand These I heard were call'd  Coquets  in the Language of the Country  They seem'd to do nothing but sport and flutter about without gaining any Ground or  desiring  to gain any  THE next I was told were  Prudes  And these had taken a ByePath and mov'd onward toward the Temple very slowly and to all Appearance unwill∣ingly with their Necks fantastically re∣verted and their Eyes looking back upon the Country they had newly pass'd through Yet These were the First that came up and slipt silently into the Temple  AMONG the Men was a Troop which seem'd compos'd of the most expert Tra∣vellers My Guide inform'd me They were call'd  Hibernians  They did many Things I perceiv'd very differently from the rest For while others led up but  one  Companion to the Temple these had seve∣ral in several Paths and were the only Persons who after lodging  One  went out again to conduct  Another  It was easy to distinguish them however mingled in the Crowd by the  Shine  of a certain  Metal  which had burnish'd their Cheeks and Fore∣heads and cast a  Gleam  like a  Corinthian Vizard  I WAS call'd off by a confus'd Noise at some Distance and made toward it as well as I cou'd but found such an Alte∣ration in the Air that I cou'd not stir one Step without sneezing This was a Troop of  SwordKnots  and  Cockades  displaying  a powerful Instrument that glitter'd much and was call'd a  SnuffBox  The Scuffle of Tongues was so great that I staid not long among the  Pretty Gentlemen  for that was the Name they went by but pass'd on to a Part of the Grove whence there issued a delightful  Harmony  COMING thither I observ'd a Number apart from the rest with Harps in their Hands which they touch'd with transpor∣ting Melody Nine Goddesses were mix'd among them all most ravishingly beauti∣ful These happy Gentlemen I found were the Favourites of the Grove but they made no Haste to the Temple rather wandering up and down and making  Sal∣lies  into every Path with an Air of agree∣able Indifference  I LEFT them and came up with a Troop of Clowdy Haughty and Erect Movers distinguish'd by  peculiar HeadPieces  which at Distance look'd like  Diadems  All the Female Travellers they chanc'd to meet with receiv'd their Whispers with a kind of Triumph and listen'd to them with more Rapture than even to the Voices of those  Divine Musicians  This Train was under the Care of two Goddesses whose Names were  Insolence  and  Privilege  I was now within the Sight of the Temple but taking an Aversion in my Sleep to the affected  Struttings  of this Company I wak'd fortunately out of my Dream and resolv'd to send it to the PLAINDEALER  The Plain Dealer No  Segnius irritant animos demissa per aurem  Quam quae sunt Oculis commissa fidelibus quae  Ipse sibi tradit Spectator  HOR  FRIDAY  January    AN Evil Spirit had taken Possession of one of the Villages in  Lapland  and turn'd the Inhabitants into  Bears  By which Means being depriv'd of the  Discretion  of  Humane Creatures  and unable to provide for  Themselves  the King of the Country committed them to the  Keeping  of two or three of his  BeefEaters  who took the Of∣fice with no other Prospect than to live at their Ease on the  Perquisites  of it and were consequently more inclinable to provide Diet to their  own  Taste than to that of the Meta∣morphos'd  Animals  which had been deli∣ver'd into their CustodyThey had how∣ever so much Gratitude for the Profit ac∣cruing from their  Grant  as to resolve That the poor Creatures shou'd want nothing that was  Strong  and  Savoury  But they had not  the Judgment to consider That a  Man  when he becomes a  Bear  requires a  coarser  Kind of Nourishment than he was accu∣stomed to while a  Rational Creature  They gave 'em nothing to drink but  Brandy  and fed 'em with  CockBroth  and  Forc'dMeats  'till they All grew giddy and lightheaded and were taken with a dange∣rous  Vertigo  A YOUNG Shepherd who had been brought up a little  wildly  and who by li∣ving much among Beasts had acquainted himself with the  Nature  of  Bears  under∣took to  Board 'em Cheaper  and built and open'd to that End a  New House of Enter∣tainment  where for the same Rates which were paid his Rivals he treated the Ani∣mals in their own Way with  raw Horse Flesh  instead of  Ragousts  and  Spring Wa∣ter  in the Place of  Brandy  The  Bears  were strangely delighted at a Change they were so able to relish and flock'd in Trans∣port to their  New Ordinary  where they  grinn'd  and grew  fat  upon a  Diet  which was adapted to their Palates So that in a little Time not a  Cub  of any  Quality  cou'd make a Meal upon their  Old Commons  And the poor Shepherd who provided for them  so judiciously  had all their Custom for the future and became Richer than the  King's own BearWards  How such an odd Story as this came in my Way I know not But I will leave it as I found it For I am in a Humour to talk of the  Theatres  THE  Royal Company of Comedians  differs from the  SouthSeaCompany  the  Bank  and other  Acting Companies  of this  City  in this one Point among more That It has  Dire∣ctors  but no  Governour  It is certain how∣ever that those  Gentlemen  whom they call their  Managers  have had all possible Advan∣tage on their Side The CourtAuthority and Countenance went with themThe  Noble  and the  Ignoble  join'd in a long and unreasonable Partiality to support them  without Rivals  in direct Opposition to the Interest of their own Pleasure which is un∣doubtedly best provided for when  Rival Theatres  contend which shall most deserve EncouragementIt is worth while then to examine how they  lost  this Advantage And I take the Fact to be thus  THE good  Old Patentee  of the  New Thea∣tre  died under a Length of Oppression and left his  Right  and his  House  to his  Son  an Unfear'd and Friendless Youth of whom it might then have been said as of  Chamont  in the  Orphan  His  Hopes  were  all  his Fortune  HE  Open'd  against a Tide of  Prejudice  and acted many Years not only without  Favour  but almost without  Notice  at least from the  Fashionable World  He try'd every  Reasonable  Art of  Pleasing  without SuccessHe reviv'd the best old  Old Plays  and brought on several  New Ones  but had often the Mortification to oppose his own  Industry  and the sublimest Scenes of  Shakespear  to the cold Encouragement of  Empty Boxes  What shou'd he do in this CaseThe Torrent of Opinion was  against him  Good  Sense  and solid  Thinking  were as Useless to him as his  Boxkeepers  At last by a Quickness in his  Natural Wit  and a Satyri∣cal Sharpness in his  Observation  He perceiv'd he had nothing to do if he wou'd have the  Game  play'd into his Hands but to lay aside his  Judgment  and abandon Himself to his  Fancy  IN Pursuance of this lucky  Discovery  He compos'd a  New Species of Entertainment  which had an infinite deal of  Sense  in them but it was only the  Sense  of  Seeing  It is scarce possible to conceive the  Ease  which this Reformation of the Stage gave the Bulk of our  Genteel Audiences  They cou'd now laugh out without Restraint for they were no longer in Danger of  being Merry in the wrong Place  They felt no Weight of  Words  which had formerly  lain heavy  upon their  Understandings  And the Burden of their  Attention  being so commodiously  ligh∣ten'd  they  came  and  saw  and were  satisfied  THE old  Managers  were indiscreet enough not only to  envy  but to  imitate  himThey made That their  Choice  which in their  Rival  had been  Necessity  But at∣temping it with inferior Genius they ap∣pear'd so aukward and ungraceful in it that they  compell'd  their partial  Admirers to take Notice That they were excell'd  And so taught 'em from that Time forward to believe it probable That since in  one  Point they had so manifestly the  Disadvantage  they might in  Others  too have been rather  Fortunate  than so  Deserving  as they had concluded them  THUS the  Young  and  Oppress'd  became a a Match for the  Old  and  Prosperous  He has continued ever since to maintain the Ground he won 'till the Current is now turn'd and dispos'd to  run in his Favour  SO far his  Wit  has carried him We are to look out for his  Judgment hereafter  But for my Part I am of Opinion That when he shall have  toy'd  us into Good Humour enough to forgive him a little  Reason  he will have Courage and Generosity to restore the Stage to its Dignity and exchange our  Ju∣leps  for  Substantial Diets  as soon as our sick Stomachs shall have recover'd Strength enough to digest itThere is scarce a surer  Proof  That a Man has  Worth  than the Re∣spect which he shews the  Worthy  And I was delighted the other Day with the Praises in which I heard it told at an  Assembly  That the  OLD BATCHELOR  is by this Gentle∣man's Voluntary Offer to be acted next  Monday  at the  Theatre  in  Lincoln'sInn Fields  for the Benefit of so Learned a Benefactor to the Stage as Mr  DENNIS  UPON my expressing some Concern That it was not rather a Play of Mr  Dennis  's own Writing I was inform'd That the Master of that  Theatre  who sought all Opportunities of shewing his Esteem of so Excellent and so Injur'd a Judge of Wit and Learning had left the  Choice  of the  Play  to Mr  Dennis him∣self  who had pitch'd upon the abovemen∣tion'd because it was a Work of his old Friend Mr  Congreve  I acknowledg'd the  Generosity  of the Master of the  Theatre  and the  Modesty  of the  Gentleman  whom he treats with so welljudg'd a Humanity But I cou'd not avoid indulging a Fit of talkative  Spleen  against that  Malice  or  Ignorance  which has more than once appear'd in the Discounte∣nance of some Writings from which the  Name  of Mr  Dennis  will long continue to receive Honour after his  Body  shall be Dust and Ashes  THE Stupidity which follows  Prejudice  has made Thousands of his Cotemporaries insen∣sible of his Great Merit which if they al∣low'd their Reason to examine it they wou'd be  charm'd by  and take a  Pride  to  encourage  The Terror with which young Writers have accustom'd themselves to hear and to talk of his  Austerity  and of his Aversion  against  Scriblers  has spread abroad a false Opinion that he is  Illnatur'd  where he is only  impartial  And that he is an Enemy to  Wit  and  Learning  while he is only such to the  Prophaners  of them  IT is pleasant to observe to what a whimsi∣cal Degree this  Dread  of  Criticks  has been propagated and how far down into Low Life we may trace the Effects of our Poet's mistaken Outcries who by giving their  Shep∣herds  the Name of  Wolves  have taught the Clowns to set their Dogs upon 'em and cut off the Defence of their own Fold Honest Mr  David Cook  the ingenious  BellMan  of  PyeStreetCorner  is I find against the Open∣ing of the  New Year  under terrible Appre∣hensions from the Impressions he has been fill'd with of the Dangers all Good  Works  are expos'd to  "  Great Sirs  my Muse has  You  her Guardians chose  "Against the  railing Malice  of her  Foes  "For she perceives  these wellmeant Lines  must bear  "The  CRITICK's Censures  who will  Nothing spare  I WAS visiting where one of honest Mr  Cook  's  GREAT SIRS  ask'd him  Why he was afraid of Criticks  and was much edified by his Answer  One Mr  Pope  Sir an inge∣nious Member of OUR Fraternity knows much of these Matters and has said it in Print That  "  Criticks  proceed without the least Remorse  "Seize on our  Fame  and put their Laws in Force  THO' I smil'd at the  Turn  of this Reason for the Fears of so safe a Muse as Mr  Cook  's yet I can't help wishing that no great Wri∣ter had ever allow'd himself to join the com∣mon Cry against CriticksIf the Poets have  no Art  they are a Race of Contemp∣tible Triflers and if they have  Art  they have  Criticism  Whoever is a good  Poet  is and must be  Himself  a  Critick  To be afraid of a  Judge  is the Mark of a  criminal Conscience  But the severe and manly Censures which are peculiar to Mr  Dennis  's Writings have encreas'd the Number of his Enemies by a piercing  Sharpness  which they carry with them Such Arguers if they had liv'd with  Cato  wou'd have made War upon that  noble Plainness  which distinguish'd and supported his Cha∣racter And refus'd the Reverence due to his  Vertues  because His  Manners  were not supple enough to fall in with their Notions of  Politeness  THE best Way to become acquainted with a Writer is to look for him in his WritingsHis  Soul  which is his Noblest  Self  lives there and is there  discovered  How often have I remember'd with Pain for the In∣famy it must one Day bring us That the most generous and extensive Design that ever was conceived by Man with Relation to the  Groundwork  of  Criticism  in  Poetry  was once undertaken by this Gentleman  and a Subscription for it propos'd upon the most moderate Terms with so disproporti∣on'd a Success that after a Year or two's fruitless Application he publish'd a  Specimen  of his intended Work with an Apology for not proceeding in it Because after so long a Trial he had been able to procure no more than  Seventy or Eighty Subscribers  whose  NAMES  he printed to their Glory For they will be read an Age or two hence with a Veneration not unlike That with which the  Athenians  engrav'd those of the  Three Hundred P  triot Greeks  who defended the Streight of  Thermopylae  against the Fury of the  Persian  ArmySo wou'd those  No∣ble Few  have defended the Honour of their Country's  Judgment  against an Inundation of  Ignorance  and  Presumption  WHAT will make this Fact more wonder'd at isThat it happen'd at a Time when a boundless Profusion of Encouragement was pour'd out upon all Pretensions but Those of  Learning  and of  Modesty  But it will not I hope be  believ'd  That the  Tragedy  of  APPIUS  and  VIRGINIA  was acted Three or Four Times and  forgotten  in spite of those powerful Passions and strong Pi∣ctures of transported Nature which it every where abounds with Or that  Shakespear  's  CORIOLANUS  cou'd be alter'd by such a Hand as Mr  Dennis  's and so strikingly to its Advantage and yet brought on with∣out Success where  Shakespear  's  RICHARD  THE THIRD  rack'd and mutilated by a barbarous  Player  ran into Fame and Ap∣plause and drew Audiences every Season  BUT I can never expect Room in such a Paper as the PLAIN DEALER to touch the Merits of this Gentleman's Writings for whose Benefit as above the Play of  Mon∣day  next is to be acted And who now descending apace into the  Vale  of  Years  ought to find his Way made smother for him and lose Sight of these malignant Enmities which his stronger Days have grappled with There can be nobody who is a Friend either to Learning or Humanity and who has his Heart in the right Place but must feel a ge∣nerous Delight in being  present for His Be∣nefit  whose whole Life has been taken up with  Essays for the Benefit of Others  The  Brave  and the  Beautiful  will agree in a Resolution to Shine out upon this Occasi∣on where They will be known to  appear in the Cause of Wisdom  And where to be  seen  is to be  honour'd Themselves  for  doing Honour  to  unrewarded Excellence  The Plain Dealer No  Numquam adeoque pudendis  Utimur exemplis ut non pejora supersint  JUV  MONDAY  January    I HAVE somewhere met with a Story of one of the ancient Princes of the  East  I think it was ANTIOCHUSHe was hunting and lost his Followers and Night coming on after a tedious Wandering over Heaths and Forests he came at last to a little Cottage where the Poor People were at Supper and enter∣tain'd him very chearfully as a Traveller who had lost his way The chief Subject of their Discourse was concerning the  King  and his  Ministers  As for the  King himself  they accus'd him of  no Vices  They spoke of him with much Duty and agreed That he  meant well  and was desirous of his Subject's Hap∣piness But he was not they said so abso∣lutely the  Monarch  of his  Ministers  as of his People Submitting his own Sense of Affairs  and the Authority of his Determinations to Men of less Vertue and Understanding than Himself and giving Way to Ease and In∣dolence while he devol'd the Power of his Office on Wretches whose Hearts were too narrow and their Passions too violent to de∣serve any Government at all much less That of a  Kingdom    THE King said little to all This but laid it up for his Use and Benefit And in the Morning when his Guards and the Great Men of his Court having follow'd the Track of his Horse were come to him at the Cottage he receiv'd them with this Declaration  You are mistaken if you sup∣pose I have been all Night out of my WayI have sat in Counsel with an Assembly of the only Honest and faithful Advisers I met with since I became your Sovereign Nor did I ever hear a Word of the True Condition of my Affairs before I learnt it in this Cottage  THE Condition of a Nation where  Mi∣nions  have their Prince in  Pupilage  is so vast∣ly the  Reverse  of  Ours  That a Discourse on such a Subject must be forc'd to draw  Exam∣ples  either from the Histories of Foreign Countries or from our own remov'd far backwardBut as the Blessing of a perfect  Health  is never better understood and valued than while he who is so happy as to enjoy it employs himself in reading the  Symptoms  of some dangerous and dread∣ful  Disease  so the Comfort which we  Free  Britons  must receive from a Comparison of our  own Happiness  with the  Misery of Others  is an Argument which convinces me that no Theme deserves more justly the Consi∣deration of a PLAIN DEALER  I WILL venture to lay it down as a  Maxim  That where the Soul of a  Minister  is not  Great  enough to  overlook  and for∣give and to drown all  Personal Regards  in the Ocean of his  Publick Cares  let his other  Vertues  and good  Qualities  be never so nu∣merous and so shining he will confound his Prince's Interest with his own private Re∣sentments Instead of  healing  Divisions he will  inflame  them and by a Thousand passionate  Extravagancies  draw upon himself a Universal  Hatred  and upon his Sovereign a  Contempt  that is the most dangerous of all Motives to Sedition and what wise Princes have been careful to guard themselves against by a  Spirit  and  Activity  which even where they have not been  lov'd  serv'd at least to make them  fear'd  which is the  next  sure An∣chor of  Obedience  THE Best of Princes have had their  Favou∣rites  But it is the easiest Thing in the World to distinguish the MINION from the MINISTER The MINISTER is his Prince's Instrument The MINION makes an Instrument of his PrinceUnder a MINI∣STER the common Themes of all publick Conversation are his Great Designs for the Ornament or the Interest of the Kingdom  Benevolence Mercy Wisdom  Generosity  and  Magnificence  flow down upon the People in a Current of new Laws and BenefitsOn the contrary under a MINION nothing is talk'd of but his Subtlety his Malice and his AvariceLittle Weathercock  Arti∣fices  and temporary  Shifts  and  Expedients  stand in Place of a steady Policy and a manly Course of  EquanimityOppression Pride Suspicion Faction Bitterness  and  Partiality  are the Products of his Influence And the  Law  which shou'd be the Measure of his Rule is the Nose of Wax to his Am∣bitionThe MINISTER takes Delight to inquire out Men of  Learning  or of  Vertue  that his  Bounty  may raise them high enough to shine like Stars upon his Administrati∣onThe MINION hates  Discernment  be∣cause he knows himself unfit to be look'd into and therefore appropriates Rewards and Preferments to the  Mercenary  and the  Ignorant  In short the MINISTER is  wise  But the MINION is only  cunning  IT is finely observ'd by  Aristotle  in his Discourse concerning  Government  "That  Monarchy  when its Power is wisely divi∣ded among  distinct Counsels  none en∣croaching on the other's Boundaries draws into it self all Advantages which are at∣tainable by any of the  CommonWealth Systems  But is in nothing so weak and unstable as in the Folly of partial Kings who ruling by their  Passion  instead of  their  Reason  remove Truth out of their hearing and submit their Will to the Guidance of some  one sole Director  neither examining Things  Themselves  nor allowing  Others  to examine them  SUCH a  Political Monster  of a MINION we read of in the  Annals  of  France  "In the Year Nine Hundred and Nineteen says the Author in his Second Book  Charles  liv'd as it were alone in  Soissons  despis'd and forsaken by his  Peers  on Account of one  HAGANON  of  Laon  a Man of  vulgar Extraction  but who was solely trusted with the  King's Secrets  and without whose Concurrence no Mat∣ter of Importance cou'd be done either in the Court or in the Kingdom But the Credit of this  New Upstart  was the Cause of the King's Ruin for the Great Men resolv'd at last no longer to endure that such a base Scoun∣drel shou'd be exalted over the Heads of the whole  Nobility  HAGIJUSOUF  a Governor of  Arabia  under the Reign of  Caliph Abdulmelec  met with a Stroke of unexpected  Satyre  which gives a lively Representation of the General  Odium  these busie MINIONS are always de∣stin'd to live underHe was hated for his Cruelty and Exactions but carried never∣theless an  Outside  of Charity and Religion  He met a  Dervis  one Day in the Street and having stop't to give him Alms re∣commended himself to his  Prayers  The  Dervis  lifting up his Eyes to Heaven cry'd out with a loud Voice  Take him from us O Great God Take him from us I beseech TheeHagiJusouf  was not satisfied with the Turn of this Prayer and began to mur∣mur at the  Dervis  But the  Holy Plain Dea∣ler  replied with great Earnestness and Humi∣lity  It is good for you and for All the  Mussulmans  THE Truth is there is an unavoidable Ne∣cessity that Princes shou'd be assisted by such Subjects as they think fit to Favour But it is happy where the Master has  Spirit  and the Servant  Moderation  For in that Case the Mischief will be either prevented or cor∣rected before its Progress is become considera∣bleOpinion and the Obstinancy of Rea∣soning have made a mighty Noise in the World concerning the Differences between  Arbitrary  and  Limited  Government But in the Nature of Things there is neither  Abso∣lute Power  nor  Freedom  taking them in their full SenseEvery  Whale  has its  little leading Fish  and follows it with a Kind of unweildy Obsequiousness This in the  Sea  has been thought a Wonder but few Things on  Land  are more usual and familiarThe most ter∣rible of the  State Leviathans  have been ma∣nag'd and led along by a  Wife  a  Mistress  a  Favourite  or some other such  dimunitive Pilot  So that in an unlimited Signification there is no such Thing as  Monarchy  THE  Grand Signior  it is true can cause any of his Subjects to be  Strangled  without assigning other Reasons for it than his  Impe∣rial Will and Pleasure  But how seldom is this done at his  own mere Motion  and how often at that of his  Vizier  's and tyrannick  MinionsI my self  says a Writer of the last Age  have known some Sovereigns so far Strangers to what was convenient that they wou'd scarce grant or deny any Thing out of the Presence of their  Secretary  THERE is but one  Consolation  which can give Men Patience while they are  suffering  under the Insolence of such Upstart Tyrants And that is their reasonable Hope that they shall live to see the  Punishment  when the  Guilt  is ripe enough for VengeanceIt is long before a Prince can break out of the obscuring Mist which an Evil Counsellor will conjure up and involve him inBut when by Accident or Reflection he comes at length to clear his Eyesight and see Things in their proper Colours the  Minion  then first becomes a  Benefit  to the People he has injur'd for he leaves them a Protection in the Example of his Fall which may guard them in Times to come against the Malice of a New Oppressor  THE last Emperor of  China  was one of the greatest Monarchs of his Age and for nothing more celebrated than the Vigour and Strictness of his  Justice  But he was warm in his Pursuits of  Pleasure  and impa∣tient of Interruption when his Mind was intent upon itThe  Viceroy  of one of the Provinces of that vast Empire that lay most remote from the Imperial City had wrong∣fully confiscated the Estate of an honest Mer∣chant and reduc'd his Family to the extremest MiseryThe poor Man found means to travel as far as to the Emperor's Court and carried back with him a Letter to the  Vice∣roy  commanding him to  restore  the Goods which he had taken so illegally  FAR from obeying this Command the  Viceroy  put the Merchant in Prison but he had the good Fortune to escape and went once more to the  Capital  where he cast him∣self at the Emperor's Feet who treated him with much Humanity and gave Orders that he should have  another Letter  The Merchant wept at this Resolution and represented how ineffectual the First had prov'd and the Reasons he had to fear that the Second wou'd be as little regarded  THE Emperor who had been stopt by this Complaint as he was going with much Haste to Dine in the Apartment of a Favou∣rite Lady grew a little discompos'd and answer'd with some Emotion  I can do no more than send my Commands And if he  refuses to obey them put thy Foot upon his Neck  I implore your Majesty's Compassion re∣ply'd the Merchant holding fast the Empe∣ror's Robe his  Power  is too mighty for my  Weakness  And your  Justice  prescribes a Remedy which your  Wisdom  has never ex∣amin'd  THE Emperor had by this Time re∣collected himself and raising the Merchant from the Ground said  You are in the RightTo complain of him was your Part but it is mine to see him punish'dI will appoint Commissioners to go back with you and make search into the Grounds of his Proceeding with Power if they find him guilty to deliver him into your Hands and leave  you Viceroy  in his steadFor Since you have  taught me how to Go∣vern  You  must  be able to  Govern for me  The Plain Dealer No  Curae leves loquuntur  SENEC HIP  FRIDAY  January    MANY Writers besides the Author of my  Motto  have observ'd That the  Lightest Griefs speak loudest  And it is doubtful whether there wou'd arise most Occasion for  Mirth  or  Pity  cou'd we see at one View the numberless Variety of little Accidents which are magnified into  Miseries  by the Impatience with which we kindle ourselves upon every unwelcome  Trifle  that runs counter to our Wish or Humour or squares not exactly with our  Interest  IF People cou'd divest themselves of the Prejudices of  SelfLove  half the Vexations which imbitter Life and rob GoodFortune of its Tranquility wou'd be found to owe their Existence either to our  Pride  or our  Avarice  But I am afraid I shall touch this Subject with very little Effect because I have a Thousand Times observed That there is a  healing Quality  in  Vanity  which cures the  Wounds of good Counsel Lady  Lowtaste  finds  SENECA so dull  where he lays open a  sordid Heart  and  shames  it by a Compari∣son with the noble Loveliness of  Generosity  That she can neither  relish  nor  support  him but falls  asleep  over his Philosophy as the readiest Way to be even with himYet who so lively in her Attention and so tran∣sported an Admirer of  this very Seneca  where he happens to speak  kindly  of any Vertue she is conscious of in  herself  or  severely  of of any Vice which she can charge upon Her  Acquaintance  There are  Two Ends  to the Glass thro' which we look into ourselves and others One  contracts  Objects and one  enlarges  them And it is the pleasantest Observation in the World to remark how kindly  Nature  has instructed the silliest and blindest of both Sexes to apply either End of this  Perspective  so as to answer their par∣ticular Purpose with as much Readiness and Sagacity as if their  Wit  were no less than it  shou'd  be  I AM overwhelm'd with Letters of Com∣plaint against  Fate IllLuck Blind Fortune  and the whole Train of  malevolent Chimera's  under whose Shadow it is usual to hide the Effects of our own Miscarriages  Arietta  a brown Coquette in her Five and Fortieth Year of Fluttering has fill'd Three Pages of an angry  Epistle Falsehood Traitor  and  In∣constancy  against a Cousin of  Ned Volatile  's who lov'd her Four Months and a Week  and then visited her no more upon a private  Intelligence  from  Mrs Lucy  that his Name was down in her  Lady's List  as the Nine and Fiftieth of her  absolute Conquests  WHAT shall we say to these insupportable Misfortunes They must be submitted to with as much Resignation as the Nature of them will bear And for what remains I can do no more than provide a little Comfort for such  afflicted Vertue  by a Proof That there are Others almost equally  wretched  If therefore  Arietta  will let me know what Part of the Town she shines in I will wait on her the Day after and  apply  a  Letter  to her wounded Heart which I receiv'd from a Druggist's Wife in the City who had  Three∣score Tickets in the last Lottery  and was so  strangely Unfortunate  that she clear'd but about  Two Hundred Pound  over and above her whole Adventure tho' an  ordinary Crea∣ture  overagainst her that had but Three Tickets in the Wheel cou'd have Two of 'em come out  such Prizes  that she sets up  truly  for a  Fortune  THE following Letter I am afraid must be number'd amonst the  Curae leves  tho' there is an Air of Concern and Sincerity in it which perswades me That the Author is in good Earnest at a Loss how he shou'd act in the Business he writes about  Fleetstreet  Decem    Dear SIR  I CONTRACTED a strict Friendship with a Gentleman And we liv'd toge∣ther for some Time during which he fell in Love with a Young Lady between whose  Body  and  Mind  there seems to be a perpetual War which of the Two shall appear  most beautiful  But she was  pro∣mis'd  by her Relations to one whose  For∣tune  is much Superior to my FriendsYet he had frequent Opportunity of  Discover∣ing  his  Passion  but wanted Courage to  declare  what he as much wanted Power to  conceal  and so was forc'd in Search of  Rest  to retire into the Country  BUT Absence instead of lessening in∣flam'd and rivetted his AnguishHe re∣turn'd to me in great Disorder and deli∣vering a Letter into my Hands press'd me with the most moving Words and Gestures to convey it privately to the Lady's  NOW Sir you must not start when I ask you this Question  Whether I ought to deliver it  The Difficulty lies hereI know her Relations have a particular Aversion to this GentlemanAnd they are Persons to whom I owe a Thousand Benefits and ObligationsMy  Friendship  is dear to my  Soul  and my  Gratitude  is due to my  Honour  I wou'd not  appear to betray  Those  who have so strong a Claim to my  Since∣rity  On the other hand I was tender of shocking the Delicacy and Refinement of a Passion so sacred as our  Friendship  Love is rash and distrustful takes Alarm at every Trifle and judges hastily and with∣out Reason He wou'd conclude if I  re∣fus'd him  That his Peace and Interest are of no Weight with meWou'd he had thought of  another Means  of conveying his Letter to the LadyBut now shou'd I advise him to it it wou'd look like Cold∣ness in his Cause and his Imagination wou'd take Fire with so many false Apprehen∣sions That he cou'd never preserve  Temper  to consider That he has push'd me where there is no Necessity for it on the surest Step by which I can incur the Hatred and the Reproaches of a Family to which I am indebted for almost every Thing that For∣tune favours me in  IN this Struggle between the Duties of  Friendship  and of  Gratitude  I can come to no Resolution I have Friends enough on whose Advice in other Things I set a very considerable Value But there is no Opi∣nion I wou'd follow so soon in a Point of this  Niceness  as that of the PLAINDEALER It is the first Request I have ever made to you and I hope you will not refuse your AnswerWhen I tell him whose Determi∣nation I act by I am sure it will satisfie him And if you  deny  me the Prejudice  may be InfiniteLet me have but a single  Paragraph  to direct me Or if that be too much give me a  Yes  or a  No  at the Bottom of One of your  Papers  and it shall be enough for one of your sincerest Admi∣rers  B B  'METHINKS the Difficulty in this Case is not so great as the  lively Painting  which describes it makes it appear upon a first ViewSince the Lover is so worthy of the Lady if he had no other Means of reaching or being recommended to her but thro' the Hands of  This Friend  my Correspondent without all Doubt wou'd have stood bound to deliver the Letter and try the utmost of his Influence to render it successful And the rather because  Interest  only and not  Merit  seems to have recommended the  Rival  But since it is so easy to find other Means as effectual and the Favours receiv'd by my Correspondent from the Lady's Family are strong Motives against his Friend's em∣ploying him where there is no visible Neces∣sity that confines the Choice to  him only  he appears to me a little  mistaken  when he strips  Friendship  of that generous  Freedom  without which it can never subsist and punishes himself with such inward Conflicts in Support of a  Delicacy  which tho' it  beau∣tifies  the  Face  of  Friendship  is rather the  Dress  than the  Body  of it  OF all human Passions this of  Friend∣ship  is the most refin'd and I might almost say too the most  ardent  But I wou'd be un∣derstood to speak of the  Thing  For the  Word  is much more common and less powerfulMost People when they say  Friend  mean  Com∣panion  or  Acquaintance  But alas what in∣finite DifferenceHow Few can distinguish between  Friendship  which is a Parity of Souls and  Affection  which is a Claim of Blood or a Tye of mutual Interests or an Agreement of Hopes or Fears or Principles or Hu∣mours or any of these mistaken  Fellowships  which are  Parts  of  Friendship  but  not Friend∣ship  I SAID it was the most  refin'd  of all our Passions And it is  so  from its Disinterested∣ness its Nobleness and its Exemption from all  Earthly  Motives It is a  strugling  of the conscious  Soul  to enlarge her  Limits  in the  Body  and exert herself in generous  Sallies  into the  Purlieus  of  Immortality  It is in∣deed a  Desire  but it is such a Desire as the  Angels  burn withIt is an Exaltation of the  Human  Nature by a powerful Mixture of the  Divine  And serves to give us an Ideal Fore∣taste of our  Business  when we shall have out∣sail'd  Time  and launch'd into  Eternity  I had a Friend  says our immortal  Dryden  in some or other of his TragediesI for∣get the particular  Place  but must always remember the Beautiful Description  I had a  Friend  that  lov'd  me  I was his  Soul  He  liv'd  not but in  me    We were so  lost  within each other's Breast  That  neither  found himself but in the  other  We  mix'd  like  meeting Streams  that flow together  All  knew  us different yet perceiv'd us  one  Nor cou'd  again divide  us  BUT I am entering on a Subject which shou'd I do more than barely  touch  it wou'd carry me away with it into a Length in which I might  lose my self  and my Reader And the best Way I can find to prevent it will be to put an End to this  Day's Paper  with two Excellent  Stanza's  from  Spencer  which are very strong and elegant upon the Subject  Hard is the Doubt and Difficult to  deem  When All Three Kinds of  Love  at once contend  And cleave the labouring Heart with wild Extream  Which  with  most Power  the stubborn  Will  can bend  Or  dear  Affection  which from  BLOOD  descends  Or  raging Fire of  LOVE  to  Womankind  Or  that sweet  Tye of Souls  that fastens  FRIENDS  Yet  sure  the Knot that joins the  fellow'd Mind  Shou'd the associate Heart with strictest Ʋnion bind  The  Love  of  Kindred  soon will feel Decay  And shrink or melt in  CUPID  's scorching Flame  But firmer  Friendship  bears its  fiercest Ray  And  bright'ning  in the  Proof  its Rage can tame  Inviting  Trial  and despising Blame  For as the  Soul  inspires our moving Clay  And gives the  Body  every Act and Aim  So the  Soul's LOVE  does Love of  Bodies  pass  Far as the  ripen'd Gold  surmounts the  cank'ry Brass    The Plain Dealer No  Gratum est quod patriae Civem populoque dedisti  Si facis ut Patriae sit idoneus utilis agris  Utilis bellorum pacis rebus agendis  JUV  MONDAY  January    To the  AUTHOR  of the  PLAIN DEALER  SIR  HAVING lately met with an Op∣portunity of looking back upon a Compleat  SETT  of your PLAIN DEALERS the last Paragraph in your  Paper  of  Mon∣day  the th of  November  puts me upon asking Whether it would not be worth while to bestow an  Essay  to shew the  Honour  as well as the  Profit  of  TRADE  in order to remove that mistaken Motion which possesses the Minds of the  Indolent  and  Unthinking  Part of our Nobility and Gentry  That by engaging in TRADE they degrade themselves  YOU will easily prove the  contrary  since not only our  Credit  at Home but our  Pow∣er  Abroad is supported by it Besides which the Education necessary to qualify a Man for a compleat  Trader  is such as becomes a Gentleman of the first Rank For he should be a Proficient in  Languages History Geography  and  Mathematicks  And in order to be Master of the Improve∣ments which may be made in every Soil and Climate he should know something of  Natural Philosophy  He ought to be ac∣quainted with the  Policy  and  Government  of all Nations And though he does not immediately concern himself in the Ma∣nagement of  State Affairs  yet he should be  qualified  for a  PRIME MINISTER  OUR Youth of  Title  and  Gaiety  are generally taken with the Character of a  SOLDIER  and it must be allowed a  Noble Employment  Especially when as∣sumed in the Defence of our Country But then it may be remembred That the Art of  War  was introduced thro' the  Corruption  of Mankind and is always attended with  Ruin  and  Desolation  OTHERS who would appear more polite than their Neighbours breed up their Sons to practice the  LAW  but I am sorry to say that  This  considered as a  Profession  is is attended with Consequencs as Fatal to Families as  That  is to NationsFor  though our  Seats  of  Justice  are filled with Men from whom we may expect All that is equal and just yet by the  Turns  and  Managements  of the inferiour Practicers in those Courts our Approach to Them is made so  Intricate  and  Expensive  that they who are obliged to sue for their own Right in the common Forms are frequently  un∣done  even though they obtain the  Verdict  in their  Favour  THUS the Properties of the People are render'd precarious and many Difficulties are put upon them in their Pursuit of  Justice  by those who pervert the true  In∣tention  of the  Law  and make That a dark  Mystery  which being the Rule of every Man's Actions  should lie open and plain to his Understanding  AND here I cannot help mentioning a Thing which though it seems but a Tri∣fle much be allowed to look like a very unreasonable HardshipThe Manner of making out and serving a  Subpoena  in  Chancery  This is a small Slip of Parchment roll'd up in a Lump of Wax and may chance to be serv'd in the Coun∣try upon a Person who can hardly read the plainest  English  When it comes to his Hands perhaps at first he is  affraid to break it open  but if he proves  hardy  enough to do that he is not one Jot the wiser for it is wrote in  Barbarous Latin  with odd unintelligble  Abbreviations  and in a  Hand more resembling a Set of  Hierogly∣phicks  than the Letters of a  Christian Al∣phabet  THE poor Man thinking no Harm lays it by till his Convenience serves him to get it  explained  by the first  Great Scholar  he happens to meet with But in the mean Time upon this Delay out comes an  Attachment  and so on to a  Writ  of  Re∣bellion  for no other Reason than that a Man who was bred to understand nothing but  Husbandry  could not decypher a Sum∣mons served upon him in a  Language  he never heard of and a  Character  which the Parson of the Parish might himself have been equally puzzled by  THERE are many other Proceedings in the  Law  of a like Nature which if truly considered have methinks but an  odd  Ap∣pearance in a Country of so much  boasted Liberty  But if while we censure what seems thus unreasonable in the Method of some of our  LawPractices  it should be alledged That Notwithstanding all this it has produced many Great and Useful Men  I allow it  only it may be worth considering Whether we have not more Reason to be  ashamed we stand in need of them  than to boast that we  have them  And I will ask this plain Question If that would not be esteemed a  happier Climate  where there is no Need of  Physicians  than where the Uncertainty or Unwholesome∣ness  of the Air has encourag'd so many of them to settle that you are sure of finding a Good One in every Street  I BEG Pardon for this Digression but I was led into it by mentioning the  Law  as a  Profession  compared with that of the  Mer∣chant  in order to engage your more able Pen to show at large how much  One  is preferrable to the  other  as well with re∣spect to the  Honour  as the  Usefulness  that attends itsince All who raise their For∣tunes meerly by the Practice of the  Law  or the Success of the  Sword  must necessa∣rily do it upon the  Ruin  of  Families  and  Nations  Whereas the Generous  TRADER  while he enriches  himself  is spreading Be∣nefits to all about him From whence we may infer That  This  is the Employment most agreeable to the  Original Design  of our  Beings  which was not to  destroy  but to  comfort  and  cherish  each other  MOSES  was a great  Lawgiver  and  David  was a  Warriour  But  SOLOMON  whom GOD was pleased to honour with still sublimer Marks of his Favour and to whom He gave the  wisest  and most  Under∣standing HeartSo that there was none like him BEFORE neither should Any rise AFTER like unto him  This  Solomon  the Greatest King the Chosen People of GOD ever had was a  MERCHANT  and sent Fleets by way of the  Red Sea  to bring home  Gold  from the  East Indies  And  what  Noble Monuments  did this Prince leave behind him of his  Wisdom  and his  Gran∣deur  BUT we have a living Example in the  CZAR  a Prince who has done more for the Advantage of his Country and his own Glory by encouraing  Arts  and  Sciences  and improving every Branch of  Trade  in his Dominions than by all the  Battles  he has ever foughtIn fine  who  has not observ'd That  our own most Gracious  SOVEREIGN at the opening this present Session of  Parliament  recommended from the Throne  the Encouragement  of  TRADE  and  NAVIGATION as the great Means to Support and Establish us  IF you think any of these Hints can be of Service to the Publick you may use them as you please  I am SIR Your very humble Servant  PATRICIUS  Jan    th    I AM perfectly in the Sentiments of the Ingenious Gentleman who sent me the fore∣going LetterBut the Subject which he has recommended can never hope to succeed better than under the Care of so able a Hand as his own And for that Reason I am very desirous of the Continuance of his Correspondence  THE Opinion That  Merchandizing deba∣ses Blood  is a Folly worthy only of the  Tribe  to whom this Gentleman imputes itIt is a Truth too well known that the INDOLENT and UNTHINKING  Part  of our  Nobility  and  Gentry  is a very  large  Part of them But Heaven be prais'd not at all a  considerable One  They are a Race of  plea∣sant Creatures  who had the Honour to be born for their  own Ease  but for the  Enter∣tainment  of other PeopleThey put me in mind of the Innkeeper in the STRATAGEM who was able  at present  to produce none of the  Good Things  his Guests wanted but had the Satisfaction of remembring that he could have furnish'd 'em All  if they had din'd with him last SUNDAYNo Matter how purblind  a Man of  Quality  happens to be since he had a  Great Grandfather  that was  sharp sighted  He may  be a Fool too  HIM∣SELFbut it ought to be  Scandalum Mag∣natum  to laugh at himFor he has  Proofs  in the  Herald's Office  That his FOREFATHERS cou'd  act wisely  WE have the Comfort however to know that  All  our  Lords  are not LORDS OF TRADE If they  were  my Correspondent's Excellent Notions might be urg'd with an Effect but illproportion'd to their Value and fall un∣der the  Noble Eye  of not a Few able Mini∣sters of the same Stamp with a famous One in a late Reign who when a certain Knight a Great Trader presented him with a  Scheme  for the Improvement of Commerce  threw it back to him with a  wise Contempt  and ask'd him  Whether he thought that Men of HIS QUALITY had nothing to do but to read Papers  TO the just and lively Observation  That a Merchant ought to be qualify'd for a Mini∣ster of State  I will add this Wish of my ownThat we may never have a  Minister of State  who is not  qualified for a Merchant  Not  Trade  alone but  Politicks  would soon feel the Benefit of so  new  a RegulationYet there is a Happiness  still greater  and it is the  Last  the  warmest Hope  of those to whose successful Industry we owe our  Com∣merceThat the Way might always lie open to the Ear of our Princes Themselves  without passing the  narrow Posterns  which  Truth  is often oblig'd to  wait at  'till it has wearied it self to no Purpose  THE First remarkable  Start  in the En∣largement of the  English Traffick  was made in the Reign of our Highspirited  Queen Eli∣zabeth  And to what Kind of Measures it was owing may I presume be gather'd without much Difficulty from the following little Story which I have taken out of Sir  Walter Raleigh  's Discourse concerning the  Prerogative of Parliaments  QUEEN  Elizabeth  would set the  Reason  of her  meanest Subject  against the  Authority  of her  greatest Councellor  By her Patience  herein she raised the ordinary  Customs  of  London  above  Fifty thousand Pounds a Year  without any new ImpositionThe Lord Treasurer  Burleigh  the Earl of  Lei∣cester  and Secretary  Walsingham  All  Three PENSIONERS  to Customer  Smith  join'd to set themselves against a poor  Waiter  of the CustomHouse call'd  Car∣warden  and commanded the Grooms of the Chamber not to give him AdmissionBut the Queen sent for him on a Peti∣tion which he deliver'd into her Hands and gave him Countenance  against them all  It would not serve the Turn  with Her  to be told by her Great Officers that she  disgrac'd Them  by allowing her Ear to the Complaints of  busie Heads  and that she dishonour'd Her  own Dignity  She had al∣ways This to answer  That If Men shou'd complain unjustly against her Ministers she knew well enough how to punish themBut if they had Reason for the Complaints they offer'd Her She was Queen of the SMALL as well as of the GREAT and would not suffer Herself to be BESIEG'D by Ser∣vants who cou'd have no Motive for wishing it but their Interest in the Oppression of others  The Plain Dealer N  o    Audit iter numeratque dies spatioque viarum  Metitur vitam  CLAUD  FRIDAY  January    I THINK I have already inform'd my READERS That I am a great Lover of  Walking  But I don't know whether I have yet acquainted them with a Custom I have to  look back  from every Rising Ground I meet with in my Perambulations and ex∣amine the Change of Prospect and the Face and Scituation of the Country I have left behind me  I HAVE transplanted this good Custom from my  Body  into my  Mind  which I have for some Years past inur'd to make  Pauses  now and then in  Life  and reckon over its  past Stages  and the Uses I have adapted them to And This I sometimes do after a  General  and at other Times in a more  par∣ticular  MannerThe  Distinction  of  Ages  by  Solon  into Divisions of  Seven Years  is an Example of the  First  Kind and has some∣thing  in it that is just and natural and uncommon enough to be worth translating  The  Seven  first Years of Life Man's Break of Day  Gleams of short Sense a  Dawn  of  Thought  display  When  Fourteen  Springs have bloom'd his downy Cheek  His soft and blushful  Meanings  learn to  speak  From  Twenty One  proud Manhood takes its Date  Yet is not Strength compleat till  Twenty Eight  Thence to his  Five and Thirtieth  Life's  gay Fire  Sparkles burns loud and flames in  fierce Desire  At  Forty Two  his Eyes grave  Wisdom  wear  And the  dark Future  dims him o'er with  Care  On to the  Nine and Fortieth  Toils increase  And busy  Hopes  and  Fears  disturb his  Peace  At  Fifty Six  cool Reason reigns intire  Then Life burns  steady  and with  temp'rate Fire  But  Sixty Three  unbinds the Body's Strength  E're the unwearied  Mind  has run her Length  And when from  Sev'enty  Age  surveys her Last  Tir'd she stops sho tand wishes  All were past  OF the  second  and more  particular  Kind I have met with no livelier Example than That of the illustrious  Paulo Paruta  a  Noble Venetian  who was sent Ambassador from his  Republick  to  Pope Clement the Eighth  and compos'd the following  Soliloquy  during his Residence at  Rome  wherein he briefly Examines the whole Course of his past Life  WHERE am I What am I doing What am I designingI am hastening already to the  End  of my  Life  and have hardly so much as thought upon the  End  of my  Being  I am transported with That which I am not sure to possess  a Day  and neglect to acquaint myself with what I must carry with me  thro' EternityAge  has naturally a Power to afflict and mortifie the  Body  Let it now exert a  nobler Influence  and  exalt  and  quicken  my  Spirit  Summon O my Soul thy stray'd and degenerate Thoughts Know the Dignity of thy Condition and let nothing proceed from Thee but what may truly be worthy of Thee  I FEAR if I make a Scrutiny into the Conduct of my Life I shall disgrace my blushing  Reason  by a Recollection of my  Vanity  The Tenderness of my  Infant Years  was too weak to afford Matter that cou'd merit my  Age's  Notice and yet the  Tears  methinks which it was subject to might have forewarned me That I was ent'ring upon a  Wilderness  of  Misery  IN the  Boyish  Years which succeeded  Childhood  I drew in Pleasure at my Eyes and Ears and gave my Soul a  Tincture  that prepared it for the Impressions of fu∣ture Levity  Riches Honour  and  worldly Greatness  glitter'd on me from a lovely  Distance  And  Retirement  when I  heard it talk'd of seem'd  Stupidity  or  Mad∣ness  These Conceptions gather'd Strength as I advanced into riper Life from the  Common Consent  of all Men to practise and to praise as I did And  That most  among Those who were reputed  wisest  and  most happy  AT my Entrance into  Youth  I applied myself to  Study  I delighted chiefly in  Rhetorick  and  Philosophy  and having the good Fortune to meet with Excellent Masters I made a swift and unusual Pro∣gressYet I cannot help confessing That it added Fuel to my native Pride It inflam'd me with a  Thirst  of  Praise  and serv'd to countenance that  SelfLove  which stood in need of no  Incentive  Knowledge is apt to  puff up  its PossessorsI dare not say I possess'd it But if I should be ask'd  What Fruit I reap'd by my Studies  I think I might venture to answer  That Philosophy if it did not  teach  me  TRUTH  awaken'd and prepar'd me to receive it  FOR a while I was very Earnest in the Study of  Morality  and delighted in it so much that I publish'd a Treatise on that Subject And afterwards when I was come to Man's Estate I compos'd in Obe∣dience to my Father's particular Command an Elaborate  History of my Country  But while I labour'd to contribute toward the Glory of other Men I pleas'd myself  with a flattering Prospect That I too by those my Labours should have a Place in the Temple I was building and live in my  Fame  many Ages after my  Death  Absurd Extravagance of  erring Vanity  As if what is  nothing  in  Itself  could ga∣ther an  Existence  from the Opinions of Others  NEXT I gave myself wholly up to the Service and  Government  of my Country and found my Way so plain and easy that I soon attain'd Great Honours and helped to fill the  foremost Employments  But alas What  Boast  is  This  Am I not sensible that not only the most  busy  but even the most  pleasing  of my present Thoughts will vanish like a silent Sha∣dowAll these Dignities and Di∣stinctions these  State Bustles  and  Negotia∣tions  with which my Mind is so  gloriously incumber'd  will dissolve  like Smoak into the Wind  or be wither'd like  Flowers  by the Beams of that  Sun  which cherish'd themYet unstable as these  Phan∣tasms  are and as I  know  them to be I must meditate on  Them only  My Thoughts however reluctant must at all Times and in all Places give way to the imagi∣nary Importance of these proud  Chimera's  and abandon the Contemplation of Things  intrinsically Noble  ALAS how hard it is to serve  Two Masters  of opposite Meanings my  Rea∣son  and my  Pride  seem to have divided me between them  Pride  teaches me to measure my Actions with Regard only to  outward Appearances  by which Men ra∣ther  seem  happy than  are  soBut  Reason  is always whispering me that  Pa∣tience Humility Mediocrity  and  Selfdenial  are the Roads which lead to  Felicity  As I approached to  Old Age  I grew more and more sensible on which of these Two Sides  Truth  lay But I persisted even against Conviction and sacrific'd my  Peace  and  Rest  to  Careful Power  and  Splendid Misery  WHAT then do I  wish  What is it that I am  expecting  If I know that my Pursuits are  Follies  what hinders but that I  change  themIf after having wasted the Vigour of my Life without Advantage from such Applicati∣ons I am less satisfied than when I  began  to  live  Am I weak enough to hope That while  I myself do not change the very Nature of Things shou'd alter  Shall  Disap∣pointment  turn to  Delight  because I am fondly  in Love with Pleasure  Or shall a World that produces nothing but  Cares  be taught hereafter to abound with  Comforts  That I only may be  indulg'd  with new and unnatural  Satisfaction  LOOK out my Soul upon these  Ruins  that are every where spread round thee This was once That  aweful  ROME The  Queen of the dependant WorldWhere is now her  unbounded Influence  Where the  Majesty  of her  Empire  Where are Her  Treasures  Her  Triumphs  and the dreadful Consequences of a  Thousand Victories  Are they not the Prey of  Death  and  Time  Do they not lie  buried  in these Heaps of  Ruin  And shalt  Thou  be fond of  GloryThou  who canst look down with  Pity  on the Deso∣lation of a  Power  that drew a Chain about the WorldShalt  Thou  presume to pride Thyself in  Honours  or  Distinctions  or grow  vain  upon the  little Preference  of a light and momentary Dignity  NoThou who hast  Duration  and  Stability  Thou who shalt endure  un∣wasting  thro' the  Changes  of  Eternity  consider better the true  Rate  of  Things  and proportion thy Desire to their Va∣lueIf they are not of  Real Worth  why then hast Thou  lov'd  themWhy endeavour'st Thou to  retain  them Why art Thou  shaken  at a Prospect of thy  losing  themOr grant they have in them any Thing that may be call'd a  Real Good  why at least is it not remem∣ber'd  For how short a Time thou canst pos∣sess them  A THOUSAND Ways these  worldly Be∣nefits  have it in their very  Nature  to de∣ceive usWhile we suppose their  Increase  the only Means to make us  happy    we insensibly become  miserable  For we fix our Minds so intently upon the  Little we yet want  that we continue  Dead  to the Enjoyment of All that we were before possessed ofThe Fear of  losing  what we have already got has a Power to  im∣poverish  vulgar Minds as effectually as if they really  possessed Nothing  And a greater Vexation than This the Humane Soul is not capable of being tormented byBecause as the Misery is  imaginary  it is  boundless  and as it drew its Evil from  Depravity  it can receive no  Cure  from  Reason  Strange Perverseness of our NatureWe have our  Happiness within ourselves  and are always seeking it  abroad  We have our  Miseries remote and without  and yet are for ever  smarting inward  and transplanting Tor∣tures to ourselves which have no  Roots  but in our Diligence to  excite  and  nourish  our own Mischiefs  IF we  feed  the Soul with Meat which is not  proper  to her Nature what Won∣der that she  pines  and can never be  sa∣tisfied  But I perceive while I  praise MARY  I am  imitating MAR∣THA  I discern the  right  Way But I chuse to travel in the  wrong  till I have lost my self in its intricate WindingsI am troubled and  busied with many Things  tho' I know well enough that there is but  One  of 'em sincerely Necessary  I am  birdlim'd  by the tempting WorldI am given over to a Variety of solicitous and grinding  Cares  which I hug like  Blessings  to my Bosom and am soften'd more and more into an Affection and Partiality for themThe Love and Gratitude I owe my  Friends  The Hopes and Fears and touching Tenderness with which I think of my  Wife  and  ChildrenDomestick  and private  Oeconomy  and the weightier Con∣cerns of the  Government  of the  Common∣wealth  press my Thoughts on every Side and afflict me with Purposes dia∣metrically  opposite  to each other  FAIN wou'd I  free  my Soul and re∣store her to her  Liberty  from these  Passions  which confine and torture her But I nei∣ther know  how  nor  when  to resolve itYet am I comforted however That I feel in myself a strong  Desire  to exert the Prerogative of my  Reason  Since I consider it as a Sign that tho' I am not  able to do well  I retain the  Principles of welldoing  The Plain Dealer No  Hoc habet animus argumentum suae divinitatis  Quod illum divina delectant  SEN  MONDAY  January    To the  AUTHOR  of the  PLAINDEALER  SIR  IF You think This may deserve a Place in one of your Papers insert it If not deal Plainly and commit it to the Flames and either way you will oblige  Yours  c  THE Wise Author of Nature gave us  Passions  for a noble End And to defend us from  Excess  our  Understand∣ings  were conferred to  regulate  them And least All should prove deficient out of His overflowing Goodness He enriched us with a  Revelation  THE Eternal Truths of the Christian Religion cast a  Shade  upon the finest and  most exalted Productions of  humane Lite∣rature  Which Remark has been fre∣quently brought as a Defence of its  Di∣vine  Original and is really a very  strong Argument  for who can imagine that without  supernatural  Assistance Men of ordinary Condition unassisted by the Lights or Improvements of  Learning  should be able in various Languages to lay down such  invaluable Principles  a Mul∣titude of which were vastly preferrable to any that had been introduced by the most penetrating of the  Heathen Philoso∣phers  SOCRATES Plato Epictetus  and several others have  thought  and  written  so well that their Memories deserve to be highly respected But what  nobler  and inimitable  Morals  How Ex∣tensive and yet adapted to all Abilities have descended to us in the  Divine Col∣lections  I have often with no small Concern lamented that the Study of the  Scriptures  is so little relish'd I had like to have said so much despised in in Comparison of the  Pagan  Writers  IN the  Schools  to open an Aquaintance with the Politest of the  Classicks  is un∣doubtedly a commendable  Outset  But to be taught a greater Admiration of them than of the  Prophets  and  Inspir'd Wri∣ters  is an  Extream  and one that is more than ordinary  Criminal  How com∣mon  is it to hear Persons expressing their utmost Fondness for the Former whilst the Last is seldom mentioned or how∣ever with much  Indifference  There are  sublime  Sentiments in the  Greek  and  Latin  AuthorsBut there is something too which I cannot forbear to take Notice of that their  Characters  were seldom suitableOne Proof of which Assertion we may borrow from  Plutarch  's Life of  Cato  Even that  Cato  who was famous for the rigid Stubbornness of his MoralityWhen his Domesticks were worn out with hard La∣bour or grown past it through Encrease of Age he would dismiss them and show no Tokens of further Regard or Huma∣nity On which  Plutarch  has left us this Reflection  That we are not to use unfortu∣nate Wretches who depend on us as we do our  old Shooes  or  Platters  and throw them away when they are  broken  and fall to Pieces in our Service  But if it were for nothing better than to express the Respect we have for the  Humane Nature  a Man ought always to cherish in himself a kind and compassionate Disposition  BUT not to digress farther There are  infinitely Sublimer  Sentiments in the  Sacred Writings  and the Lives of their Authors shone illustrious Examples of their Doct∣rineHow becoming a great Soul is  The Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away Blessed be the Name of the Lord    Again  What shall we receive Good at the Hand of God and shall we not receive Evil  How Happy would it be for Mankind if they would feel and ap∣ply to their Practice the glorious Com∣mands of our Redeemer  To do nothing but as we would be done by  to exercise our Benignity even towards those who  hate  and who  persecute  us This Proposition is contemned by too many tho' we have it so strongly recommended not only by the  Words  but by the  Practice  of Him who  died  for our Salvation Be∣sides as you have observ'd in one of your PLAIN DEALERS a Return of  Good Offices  for  Injuries  is indeed the sharp∣est  Revenge  For by such a Conduct we triumph over confound and disgrace a malicious Enemy As by a contrary Management we seem to  justify  as well as  inflame  him  IN Fine There are a beautiful Variety of Instructions in Holy Writ which can never be parallell'd They manifest their Heavenly Original And if we make 'em our Delight will alleviate all earthly Calamity and furnish an infallible Re∣medy for every Accident that can befal Us I design'd now to have ended but Recollecting that there are some who have little  Faith  in  Revelation  I'll go on a Line or two fartherSuppose we grant their  inconsistent Hypothesis  Yet  still it is our Interest to direct ourselves by the Measures of  Revealed Religion  be∣cause it is the truest Friend to humane Nature and promotes nothing which is not conducive to our Quiet and Wellbe∣ing so that allowing it were not our  Duty  it is however our  Prudence  to comply with so excellent and even so  agreeable a Model  SO far I have entertain'd my Readers with some Reflexions for which I am oblig'd to an unknown Hand on a Subject where∣on much has already been written with less Effect than might reasonably have been ex∣pected from the Force and Clearness of the Arguments  IF I am not mistaken That  Disrelish  of the  Sacred Writings  which my Correspon∣dent complains of tho' I hope it is far from Universal among us may be imputed to the low  Spirit  and flat obsolete  Expression  of the  coarse English  they are  translated  inI leave it says an Excellent Modern Critick to our Prelates and Pastors to consider Whether since they are satisfied That there is a Necessity for a  Numerous Style  in some Parts of our  Publick Worship  they ought to remain contented with the  Vile Versions  now in Use and suffer the most lofty and most pathetick Idea's of  Religion  to be  burlesqu'd  in our Churcheswhich is all one as if they shou'd dress up a  Bishop  in some  an∣tickHabit  and expose him every  Sunday in That merry Garb  to raise the  Veneration  of the People  IT is finely observ'd and indeed unde∣niably demonstrated by the same Gentle∣man in his  Grounds of Criticism in Poetry  That as the Great  Characteristick of Poetry  is  Passion  and the strongest and most mov∣ing Passions flow most naturally from  Reli∣gious Idea's  For this Reason chiefly the  An∣cient Poetry  where their  Religion  had its most powerful Influence has so visibly the Advantage over the  Modern  which is for the most Part  light prophane  and  contemp∣tible  And for the same Reason too the  Poetry  of the  Hebrews  which the  Old Testa∣ment  is every where fill'd with excell'd That of the Antient  Greeks  and  Romans  THERE are numberless Instances in the  Psalms  and among the  Prophets  and in∣deed throughout all Parts of the  Old  and  New Testaments  of a  Sublimity  that exalts the Humane Soul and shakes it with a much stronger Degree of  Terror  and  Admi∣ration  than Any the most noble Strokes of rapturous  Enthusiasm  which can be met with even in  Homer Himself  WHAT a  Collection  of  dreadful Images  are thrown together in the  Eighteenth Psalm  to describe the Majesty of GOD descending in the Fullness of his Power  The Earth tremblesThe Foundations of the Hills are shakenHe bows the Heavens and comes  downand Darkness is under his Feet  All This is animated and wonderfulBut what follows is a Conception of so immense and terrible a Grandeur that our vulgar  Translation  seems unpardonable for the manifest Injustice it has done the Mean∣ing  Then the Channels of the Waters were seen And the Foundations of the World were discover'd  But see how This  ought to have appear'd  in the noble Dress which Mr  Dennis  has given it  Still Darkness  usher'd His mysterious Way  And a black Night of congregated  Clouds  Became the dark Pavillion of his Throne  Earth upwards from the gaping Center  cleav'd  And  bar'd  the fix'd  Foundations  of the  World  A Sight that  blasted  even the World's  Great Eye  And made the starting  SUN recoil  From his  Eternal Way  WHAT comes nearest to This is That famous Passage in the xxth  Iliad of  Homer to which also the Gentleman just nam'd has given the finest Translation it ever met with  Mean while Majestick  Neptune  from below  The reeling Globe with his huge  Trident  Strook  Mount  Ida  trembled from his hoary  Top  And from his  nethermost Foundations  shook  Pluto  starts frighted from his burning Throne  And striking his infernal Breast  cries out  Least such another Stroke shou'd  rend  the  Globe  And on his  pale Dominions  let in  Day  THE  Hebrew Prophets  abound Every∣where with Idea's so  sublimely Enthusiastick  that they transport and carry away the  Rea∣der  with a Power that is  resistless  and wor∣thy of the  GOD  who is honour'd by themAmong These the Description of That De∣solation from the  East  which was prophe∣sied against the  Jews  by  Habakkuk  as we see it in his  first Chapter  has something in it so strongly painted and so  terrible  that it strikes us thro' the most unornamented  Simplicity  with a Force that was never ex∣cell'd by all the  Elaborate  Productions of Poetry  I will raise up the  Chaldeans  That bitter and fierce Nation and They shall march thro' the Breadth of the Land  THEY  are  terrible  and their  Horses  are swifter than  Leopards  and fiercer than  Even∣ing Wolves  THEY  shall come on and fly with Violence as an  Eagle  that  hastens to eat  THEIR Faces  shall  drink up  like the  EastWind  and they shall  gather  the  Captivity  as  Sand  THE fourth Chapter of the same Prophet is one continued Height of the  Divinest Ele∣vation  and I shall insert the whole Succes∣sion of its matchless Images as a Proof how truly it has been observ'd by the Gentleman who sent me the foregoing Letter  That there are infinitely sublimer Sentiments in the Sacred Writers than in any of the most celebrated Classick Authors  At  Israel's  Call th'  Almighty  's Thunder hurl'd  From  Paran  's Summit  shook  th' Astonish'd World  Frowning provok'd his threat'ning  Wrath  flam'd high  And  Earth  's dim Regions  gleam'd  beneath his Eye  Poiz'd in his undetermin'd Hands he bore  Judgment  's heap'd Horn and  Mercy  's strugling Store  Near him  Pale Death  in shad'owy Triumph trod  And press'd with  ghastly Signs  the doomful Nod  Keen from beneath his Feet red  Lightnings  broke  And the  veil'd  Mountain  shook  in  Clouds  of  Smoke  He  stood  and while the  measur'd World  he  ey'd  The starting Nations  drop'd  their warlike Pride  Highboasting  Cushan  struck her Tents with  Shame  And  Midian  groan'd beneath  repented Fame  He  stept  and from their old Foundations rent  The  Everlasting Hills  before him  bent  He  march'd  and all th'  uprooted Mountains stray  And roll in Earthquakes to escape his Way  Fastfoll'wing from their  Chasms  a thousand Tides  Spout a wish'd  Deluge  o'er their frighted Sides  Back swell'd the roaring  Sea  his Face to  fly  And in  O  e trembling Billow  scal'd the Sky  Conscious of Wrath Divine the  Sun  grew  pale  And o'er  Distinction  cast a  dusky Veil  This when I  hear  chill Frosts my Heart o'erspread  And my Lips  quiver  with the rising Dread  Trembling and sunk my Limbs I faintly draw  And my  Bones crumble  with  Ideal Awe    I SHALL close my  Paper  with the Words of a Gentleman whom I have already once or twice nam'd in it  'If Harmony  says he  is of itself so Efficacious what must it not be when incorporated with a  Religious Sense  There can certainly be no bet∣ter Way to  Reformation  than the Read∣ing of those Writings which we believe to be  divinely inspir'd  But it is equally cer∣tain that the greater the  Pleasure  is with which we read them the  oftner  we shall discharge that Duty And to make us read them with more Pleasure They must have more of the Harmony and Force of their  Originals  This would attract the  Gentry  and Persons of the most  Extraordi∣nary Parts  whose Examples would influ∣ence the rest For Persons of the most Ex∣traordinary Parts being extremely delight∣ed with  Poetry  and finding the  most exal∣ted Poetry upon Religious Subjects  wou'd by Degrees become more us'd to be mov'd by  Sacred  than  prophane Idea's  and in Consequence wou'd be  reform'd  The Plain Dealer No  Suave mari magno turbantibus aequora ventis  Et Terra magnum alterius spectare laborem  LUC  FRIDAY  January    THE  Sea  is the most  Vast  of all the vi∣sible Objects of Nature And when the Wind adds  Disturbance  and  Motion  to its Immensity There is nothing that seems so  Dreadfully  proportion'd to the Greatness of its Almighty CreatorYet as the Art of the Painter gives us a sensible  Delight  from the  Representation  of Prospects of Crea∣tures or of Actions which in their  Natures  are Productive of  Horror  so we are never more pleas'd by any Descriptions in Poetry than by Those which set before us the strongest and liveliest Pictures of  Shipwrecks  and  Storms at Sea  Whether it is that the Soul exults and prides its self in a Consci∣ousness of its own Capacity to  move  and  con∣ceive  so  greatly  Or That we derive a  sharper Taste and Enjoyment of our own  Safety  from a Comparison with those repre∣sented  Dangers  ALL the Poets Ancient and Modern have been fond of  raising Tempests  wherein for the most Part their own  Time  has been  cast∣away For  they have  scatter'd  and  weaken'd  the  Terror  they design'd to  increase  by throwing together  All the Images that occurr'd  rather than selecting the most  Essential  and  Impressive  By means of which perplexing and inconsistent  Variety  their Reader's Ima∣gination finds  Relief  from not clearly  dis∣cerning  their  Object  through the  Dust  which they have rais'd about it  IT has been observ'd by the Admirers of  Homer  That there is a Similitude between  His  manner of  Thinking  and that of  David  and  Solomon  and others of the  Hebrew Writers  who ow'd their Excellence to the Inspiration of the  Holy Spirit  Me∣ethinks this Remark which is much to the Honour of that immortal  Greek  may gather some New Force if we consider  Homer  's Description of a Tempest which  Lon∣ginus  was so justly charm'd with and com∣pare it with that of  David  in the th  Psalm  which has often been mention'd with Wonder by the  Criticks  of our own and foreign NationsBoth the  Versions  are New But Both the  Originals  are inimitableI begin with That of the  Psalmist  They who in Ships the  Sea's  vast Depths descend  And o'er the  watry World  their Passage bend  They  more than  All  their  GOD's  Great Works discern  And 'midst th'  unfathom'd Deep  his Wonders learn  There from smooth Calms on sudden  Storms  they rise  Hang  on the horrid Surge and  Skim  the  Skies  Now  high  as  Heaven  they climb their dreadful Way  Now  sink  in  gulphy Slants  and  lose  the  Day  Giddy they  reel  to shoot the frightful  Steep  And their  Souls melt  amid the  sounding Sweep  Helpless they  cling  to what supports them first  And o'er 'em feel the breaking Billows  burst  Then to their  last ALMIGHTY Hope  they  cry  Who  hears  and marks them with a pitying Eye  HE  bids the  Storm  be  hush'd  The  WINDS obey  And the  aw'd WAVES  in silence  shrink away  NOW follows  Homer  with a Terror and a Majesty which leave it almost  doubtful  to which of these  Great Poets  the Victory shou'd be ascrib'd but  Certain beyond all Question  That no other has equall'd either of them  O'er the broad  Sea  the driving  Tempest  spreads  And sounding Surges swell their  sweeping  Heads  Upwards Immense  the  Liquid Mountains  flow  And  shade  the distant Ship that  climbs below    Down her wash'd Decks the white'ning Foam rolls o'er  And the big Blasts thro' bursting Canvas roar  Back shrink the Sailors from the  briny  Grave  And see  pale Death  press close on  every Wave  WE see here no Time lost in enumera∣ting  little Particulars  All the Great and Striking Circumstances are thrown forward in their proper Lights But nothing is added That can either  diminish  or  distract  the Ap∣prehensionI have plac'd these two admi∣rable Descriptions thus opposite to each other That some of our fashionable Applauders of  Homer  may see his Sublimity more than match'd in the Works of a  Poet they have sel∣dom heard of  And that  they  who are  justly  his  Admirers  may find Cause to esteem him yet more by observing how near he comes to One whom  OD was pleas'd after a pe∣culiar manner to  inspire  and  delight in  WHILE I am upon this Subject it falls naturally in my Way to recollect a Letter that was lately sent me by a Gentleman who writ the Particulars of the Story from the Mouth of a Person who was himself an Eyewitness  To the  AUTHOR  of the  PLAIN DEALER  Will's CoffeeHouse Cornhill  SIR  YOU appear by some of your Wri∣tings to be so heartily a Lover of the Trade and Prosperity of your Country that I perswade my self you must of Ne∣cessity be a Wellwisher to the  honest Sai∣lors  A Set of Men who at the continual Hazard of their Lives contribute their  Toil and their Skill to the Power and Grandeur of the Nation And who al∣lowing  Themselves  no Leisure for Luxury furnish  Means  notwithstanding to main∣tain the Luxury of  other People  The Sailors to be short are a Race of open∣hearted gallant Thinkers who retain the Plainness the uncorrupted Sincerity and blunt  Species  of  Virtue  which distinguish'd our Forefathers and which  Old England  has so often triumph'd by in Times whose Customs we rather  admire  than  imitate  Whatever therefore relates in a very extraordinary Manner to the  Good  or  Ill Fortune  of any of this useful and worthy Race of your  Kindred Plain Dealers  I pro∣mise my self you will take Pleasure to distinguish by allowing it a Place in your Paper  THE Ship  Bouevia  of  London  of Bur∣then about Tun Captain  Brooks  Com∣mander set sail from the Coast of  Hol∣land  on the th of  November  last having two Pilots one  English  and the other  Dutch  And his  Wife  was on board with him  THE Day had been fair and clear but in the Evening about Six it blew hard at South and by West The Gale increas'd into a violent Storm and continu'd for about Seven Hours veering to the West and North and by West During which the Ship was  stranded  off of  Enchuysen  in the  Texel  IN order to save themselves if possible the Men all got into the LongBoat and were just ready to put off But not having their Captain among them they call'd to him to hasten down because the Sea ran so high that it broke over the Boat and in∣danger'd her beating to Pieces against the Side of the stranded VesselThe Cap∣tain in this nice and perilous Point of Time recollecting that his Wife was Sea∣sick in the Cabin cou'd not bear the un∣gerous Thought of endeavouring to save himself without her and was earnestly la∣bouring to bring her along with himBut she who had heard the Men cry out That the Boat wou'd sink under the weight of two Persons more embrac'd him passionately and refus'd to goShe wept and told him in the most moving man∣ner That a  Woman  in such an Extremity wou'd prove a  dangerous Incumbrance  She implor'd him not to think of  dividing  his Care but to employ it all for Preservation of his single Life much dearer to her than  her own was  FOR some Time he press'd her in  vain  but prevail'd with her at length to come up with him upon Deck where the first Observation they made was  That the Boat was out of Sight  having been beaten off by the Force of the  Swell  that rose between her and the Vessel  HE was Gazing Speechless on her Face in a Despair which he found no  Words  to  utter  when a Billow breaking over the Midship wash'd him headlong into the Sea and left  her  shrieking and alone be∣hind him in a Condition so far  less suppor∣table than his  that after a Succession of the bitterest  Outcries  she fell forward in a Swoon and sunk sensless after him  THE Boat in the mean Time endea∣vour'd to return to the Ship and passing providentially near their Captain who was yet faintly Swimming the Men discern'd him in the Sea and took him up quite Spent and Speechless In which Conditi∣on they laid him in the Bottom of the Boat and coming along the Ship's Side one of the Sailors looking up saw some∣thing like a Woman with her Arms and Cloaths entangled in the  Shrouds  THIS Woman was the  Captain's Wife  who in the Moment of her falling forward had been sav'd and supported against that Part of the  Rigging  She was still in a Swoon and  insensible  but so beloved by the Mariners that they redoubled their Efforts to get Aboard that they might have it in their Power to save her And they were so  Fortunate  in their Humanity that they found Means to lift her into the Boat Where they laid her  Dead in all Appearance  by her Husband who was in the same Condition  THEY put off again and with great Difficulty got ashore upon one of the Islands in the  Texel  where the Captain coming to himself told his Men That they wou'd have done more kindly had they let him perish in the Sea since the Life they had forc'd upon him must for ever be  imbitter'd  by the Memory of  Her un∣happy End  for whose Sake only He had thought it worth wishing forHis Wife was now recovering and near enough to  hear  and  answer  this noble Instance of his TendernessThey flew astonish'd and quite lost in Exstacy into each other's ArmsAnd it is easier to  imagine  than  describe  what they  thought  and  said  on so transporting an Occasion  LET me only add That this Relation was faithfully taken from the Mouth of a Gentleman who was an  EyeWitness  of the miraculous and providential Particu∣larsI am  SIR  Your most humble Servant G Br  The Plain Dealer No  Sed neque quam multae species Nomine quae sint  Est numerus  VIRGIL  MONDAY  January    SIR  SINCE my  Misfortune  arises only from my having  succeeded  to the ful∣lest Point of my own and my Friend's  Wishes  I know not how in Conscience I can expect your  Pity  but be that as it will my Case is somewhat extraordinary and I shall fairly  state  it with the Pur∣pose of serving as a  Buoy  for the Warn∣ing of othersYou  must  know Sir I was left an  Orphan  under the Tuition of a Rich Uncle who promis'd to settle his whole Estate upon me at the Day of my Marriage And that he might not  cramp  me in my Choice a Folly too frequently attending the Caprices of  Old Age  the only Article he insisted on was a  Woman of  strict Vertue  A Condition so very  reasonable  was sure to meet with an easie Compliance And I so  punctually  and  exactly  observ'd it that from the  overflow∣ing  of my  Wife's Vertue  my Happiness lies under Water  WHATEVER Mismanagement or Folly she happens to be guilty of she can im∣mediately set to rights by the Counter∣poize of her  Chastity  And I have no sooner  open'd my Mouth than she hits me in the Teeth with her  VIRTUE the con∣scious Good Fortune of  coming off without Cuckoldom  is it seems  a Cordial Prepara∣tive  that can defend a Husband's Palate against the bitter Taste of  Arrogance Pride Vanity IllNature  and the rest of That long Catalogue which  Female Purity  is pleas'd sometimes to arm it self with∣al against the Danger of  Worldly Temp∣tations  I SHALL content my self with men∣tioning a few Instances that lately hap∣pen'd upon the Heels of one anotherAmongst many  Neighbours in the Country  I can boast but of one  Friend  with whom I live in the greatest IntimacyHe was one Day at Dinner with me and said oc∣casionally in a laughing way That there might possibly be  other Faults  in a  Wife  as insupportable as  Adultery  At this my  Lucretia  's  Chastity  flew out at her Mouth and Eyes  The Spirit of Honesty came  upon her  and she threw the Spoons and Salts at his Head till her  Vertue remain'd Triumphant  and she had driven her An∣tagonist from Table  WHILE this Storm was in the Air there cou'd be little Quiet under its Influences so I judiciously retir'd to a Farmhouse where I had been recovering my self about a Week when a Messenger came with Tydings That my spotless Spouse having heard as Illluck wou'd have it that the Nurse to my only Child was a Bastard had turn'd her away at a Mi∣nute's Warning and kill'd the Child in Three Days after by persisting in a Resolu to  wean  it from a Milk of so  wicked an Original  Upon this melancholly Account I hurried Home where I had the Comfort to be convinc'd that I ought by no Means to be sorry for the Death of my Child since my Wife's  Vertue  was  yet alive  and her  Modesty  preserv'd  inviolate  NOW Sir what is to be done in such a CaseI wou'd tell her if I durst nay I will if you are so kind as to  stand by me That  the  Vertue  of a Man's  Wife will  never attone for the  Loss of his Friend  And that her  Chastity  is the worst Remedy she cou'd have thought on to supply the Loss of a  Son  and  Heir  Nay if she shou'd not believe me I am determin'd if you think there may be no  Danger  in it to let her alone to try the Experiment  SIR I have fairly told you my Story and beg you will expatiate upon the Sub∣ject Pray give a little of your seasonable Advice to these Professors of  Grace with∣out Gracefulness  Perswade 'em if you can to consider That a Wife's  Cha∣stity  is in the Nature of  Laudanum  to her Husband a just Quantity promotes  Rest  Too little occasions  Restless∣ness  and too much gives convulsive  Rav∣ings  Such a desperate Old Gentle∣man as  you  are may venture to say too That  Continency  by  Constitution  is rather a  Happiness  than a  Vertue  And that a Wife who sets up her  Chastity  as a  Spe∣cifick  to cure all Uneasinesses is more in∣supportable than a  Quack  who can cure only the  Toothach  and maintains for that Reason that the  Stone  the  Gout  and the  Consumption  are  Distempers of no Con∣sequence  YOURS J W  INSTEAD of complying with the Request of my Correspondent and coming in to his Assistance against so  impenetrable  a Champio∣ness I shall add to his Complaint as just a one of my own  That I too lose my Rest by  WOMENWhat they  do  or what they  suffer  is for ever invading and over∣whelming my PurposesTheir  Charms  and their  Mischefs  press in upon me from Town and CountryThe  Post groans  as we do under the Burthen of their  Vanities  But what I think ought to be reckon'd among my  Sufferings not deserv'd  isThat it often costs me a  Groat  to read one of their  Secret Histories  not worth a  Halfpenny  My Intelligencers from remote Quar∣ters make no manner of Conscience in their Correspondence with meFor while they  charge  the  Follies  they acquaint me with upon those to whom they belong They take care to charge the  Postage  upon a Person who is  wholly Innocent  I WAS lately in Despair of working any Reformation upon Offenders who possess the Power of  bewitching  those who examine them But there came to my Hands some Time since a short Treatise in Manuscript sub∣scrib'd by Seven Ladies its Authors who intitle themselves  The Order of Angels  Into this Order they tell me they propose to ad∣mit all the BELIEVING  Fair  which if they do they can never fail of a most  comprehensive  Establishment The Business they are to be  admitted for  is to learn it seems to CON∣CEIVE  after a new Manner  so as to be  brought to Bed of themselves  and by Virtue of such  New Birth  be made  Kings  and  Priests  to  God  and become what All the Best of them were at first created by the Lord to be  Real Blessed Heavenly  ANGELS  THESE being the Words of the Ladies Treatise I am restor'd to some Degree of Hope and shall shortly form a Resolution to disburthen myself of a Care I am  unequal  to and deliver over the  whole Sex  into the Hands of these  Able Undertakers  Mean while here are Three LettersThe First is a mortifying Proof that Avarice can teach Women of Fortune to  think  as  poorly  as the  Lowest  of their  Species  And the Se∣cond and Third relate to a  Grievance  al∣most too common to be  worth complaining of  I shou'd not therefore have inserted these Two but for the Sake of a Rhetorical  Figure  in the Last concerning a  Snail  whereby I have been able to gather That the Person accus'd is less pardonable for having no  Money  than for having no  Conscience  or  Ge∣nerosity  To the  PLAINDEALER  SIR  I HAVE been so unhappy for this great while as to indulge a Passion for a young Lady in whom I thought I might reason∣ably promise my self an agreeable Compa∣nion and a virtuous Wife But alas how vain and uncertain are all our Hopes A near Relation of mine who married her Sister by Errors and Misfortunes which generally go together is  well nigh reduced  which I am too sensible hath created a  Prejudice to our Family  My present Cir∣cumstances  are such as I think could not well be excepted against but am so well acquainted with the Effects of  Prejudice  that I dare not hazard revealing my Mind fearing it may totally debar me the Satis∣faction which I sometimes but alas seldom enjoy of being in her Company  AS She is your constant Reader the in∣certing this in one of your Papers may very possibly incite her to pity him who  loves  too well to  dare  to  offend  Hoping Fortune may some time offer the happy Means of possessing her the only Object of my Desires Excuse this Trouble  I am Yours  c  Good Mr  PLAIN DEALER  A DISTRESSED Kinswoman of mine desires you would be pleased to in∣sert the Epistle inclosed which I received from her by the last Post in your next Pa∣per if possible for a publick Warning to our unguarded Sex And if you would take upon you to warn these unthinking Mon∣sters the  Men  by describing the Heinous∣ness of their Crime you would do a laud∣able Act and worthy your self for Men of this Complexion are become so daring of late that none but a PLAIN DEALER dare meddle with them  I am Your Constant Admirer  E A  Dear Cousin  YOU might too justly have condemn'd my Folly if it had not been too too severely punished already I am there∣fore to intreat you to lay by your Anger least you still aggravate my too rigid Fate and lend a compassionate Ear to this dole∣ful Tragedy and consider withal that 'tis Iyour near Relation who bear the principal and insupportable Part in it No Hopes remainto speak at once the unwilling Truth and utter all my Dis∣grace  I have been betray'd  betray'd by gaudy  Outside  expecting  Wedlock

my  Woe  I can no moreLet others who are free learn from my Woes to shun the alluring Bait And least such Trea∣chery should be any longer a Secret  Dear Cousin  let me as a small Recompence for this long Train of Evils have the poor Pleasure of being a  Warning to others  and to that Intent I humbly intreat that you would get this publickly printed the first Opportunity and forgive the Error of  Your much Afflicted till Death But loving Cousin  Z H  {inverted ⁂}  PS  Do not forget to have this Printed  The Plain Dealer No  Unusquisque sua noverit ire via  PROPERT  FRIDAY  January    To the  PLAINDEALER  SIR  IN Return for that Pleasure with which I have read your Abridgment of  PA∣RUTA  's  Soliloquy  in one of your late  Papers  I send you an Abstract from a much more modern Treatise Intitled  An Enquiry into the Nature of Society  wherein the Author has consider'd  Hypocrisie  as it is the Effect of our Common  SelfLove  in a manner that is equally new and delightful and with a  Penetration  as Remarkable as the  Plea∣santry  of his ImagesIn short His  De∣scriptions  appear to me so full of Nature Wit and Liveliness that I believe they cannot fail to give great Pleasure to your Readers And for that Reason I have transcrib'd what follows and send it you for their Entertainment  THEY says this too near Observer who have never taken Notice of the Conversa∣tion of a  Spruce Mercer  and a  Young Lady  his Customer who comes to his Shop have neglected a Scene of Life that is very  en∣tertaining  HIS Business is to sell as much Silk as he can at a Price by which he shall get what he proposesAs to the  Lady  what SHE would be at is to please her Fan∣cy and buy cheaper by a Groat or Six∣pence a Yard than the Things she wants are commonly sold at  FROM the Impression the Gallantry of our Sex has made upon her she imagines That she has a fine  Mein  and easie  Beha∣viour  and a  peculiar Sweetness  of  Voice  That she is  handsome  and if not  beauti∣ful  at least more  agreeable  than most young Women she knowsAs she has no Pretensions to purchase Things with  less Money  than other People except those which are built on her  Good Qualities  so she sets herself off to the best Advantage her Wit and Discretion will let herThe Thoughts of  Love  are here out of the Case So on one Hand she has no Room for playing the  Tyrant  and giving herself  angry  or  peevish  Airs And on the other she has more Liberty of  speaking kindly  and being  affable  than she can have on almost any other OccasionShe knows that Abundance of wellbred People come to his Shop and endeavours to render herself  as  amiable  as Vertue and the Rules of Decency allow of  BEFORE her Coach is yet quite stopp'd she is approach'd by a  Gentlemanlike Man  who has every thing  clean  and  fashionable  about him And who in low Obeisance pays her Homage and hands her into the ShopThere immediately he slips from her and through a ByeWay that remains visible only for half a Moment with great Address  entrenches  himself behind the  Coun∣ter  whence  facing  her with a profound  Reverence  he begs the Favour of  knowing her Commands  LET her say and dislike what she plea∣ses she can never be directly  contradicted  She deals with a Man in whom consum∣mate  Patience  is one of the  Mysteries  of his  Trade  Whatever Trouble she creates she is sure to hear nothing but the most  oblig∣ing Language  and has always before her a chearful Countenance where  Joy  and  Re∣spect  seem to be blended with  Good Humour  and altogether make up an  artificial Sere∣nity  more engaging than  untaught Nature  is able to produce  WHEN Two Persons are so well met the Conversation must be very agreeable as well as extreamly mannerly tho' they talk about Trifles While  she  remains ir∣resolute what to  take he  seems to be the same in  advising  her But when once she has  chosen  he immediately becomes  positive  That it is the  Best of the Sort  He con∣tinues to extol her Fancy and the oftener he looks upon it the more he  wonders  that he shou'd not  before  have discover'd the Preeminence of it over any Thing he has in his ShopHe founds her Capacity finds out her Blindside and by Fifty little Stratagems makes her  overvalue  her own Judgment as well as the Commodity she wou'd purchase  THE greatest Advantage he has over her lies in the most material Part of the Com∣merce between them the  Debate  about the  Price  which  he  knows to a Farthing and  she  is wholly ignorant of Therefore he no where more egregiously imposes on her Understanding But tho' he has here the Liberty of telling what  Lies  he pleases as to the  Prime Cost  and the Money he has  refus'd  yet he trusts not to  Them only  He attacks her  Vanity  and makes her  be∣lieve  the most  incredible  Things in the World concerning  His Weakness  and her own  Su∣perior Abilities  He had taken a Resolu∣tion he says never to part with that Piece under such a PriceBut she has the Power of  talking  him out of his Purposes He protests must  lose  by her but since she seems to  have a Fancy for it  and is  resolv'd  to give no more rather than diso∣blige a Lady he has so extraordinary a Va∣lue for  He will let her have it  Only begs  That  another Time  she won't stand so hard with him  IN the mean Time the Buyer who  knows that she is no Fool  and has a  volu∣ble Tongue  is easily perswaded that she has a very winning Way of talking And thinking it sufficient for the Sake of  Goodbreeding  to disown a Sense of her Merit in some witty  Repartee  she swallows very contentedly the Substance of every Thing he has told her And the Upshot is That with the  Satisfaction  of having  sav'd Nine∣pence a Yard  she has bought her Silk ex∣actly at the same Price as any Body else might have had it for  IT is possible that this Lady for want of being sufficiently  flatter'd  or for a Fault she is pleas'd to find in his Behaviour or perhaps in the  Tying  of his  Neckcloth  or for some other Dislike  as Substantial  may be  lost  and her Custom bestow'd on some other of the Fraternity But where many of them live in a Cluster It is not easily de∣termin'd which Shop to go to And the Reasons some of the FairSex have for their Choice are often very  whimsical  and and kept as a  Great Secret  Among the Mercers a FairDealer must keep before his own Door and to draw in random Cu∣stomers make use of no other Importuni∣ty than an  Obsequious Air  and a  Bow  to every welldress'd Female that offers to look towards his Shop  BUT I have seen another Method o  Inviting Customers  the most distant in the World from what I have been speaking ofI mean that which is practis'd by the  Water∣men  on those whom by their Mien and Garb they know to be  no Londoners  It is pleasant to see half a Dozen of these  Tritons  surround a Man whom they never saw in their Lives before and Two of them who can get nearest clapping Each an Arm over his Neck hug him as familiarly as if he was their Brother newly return'd from an  EastIndia Voyage  A Third lays hold of his HandAnother of his SleeveHis Coatthe Buttons of itor any thing he can come at While a Fifth or a Sixth who has scamper'd twice round him already without being able to get at him plants himself directly  before  the Man in  Hold  and within Three Inches of his Nose con∣tradicting his Rivals with an openmouth'd Cry shews him a dreadful Set of large Teeth and a Remainder of Bread and Cheese which the Country Man's Arrival had hinder'd him from swallowing  AT  all This  no Offence is taken The Peasant thinks  they are making much of him  and therefore far from opposing them he patiently suffers himself to be push'd or pull'd which way they directHe has not Delicacy to find Fault with their  Dirt  and  Sweat  for he has been us'd to it from his Cradle And it is no Disturbance to  him to hear half a Score People some of them at his Ear and the farthest not Five Foot from him  bawl out  as if he was a Hundred Yards distantHe is consci∣cious that he makes no less Noise when he is merry  Himself  and is secretly  pleas'd  with their boisterous Usage The hawling and pulling him about he construes as a  Courtship  which he can  feel  and  understand  And he can't help wishing them well for the Esteem they seem to have for him  HE loves to be  taken notice of  and ad∣mires the  Londoners  for being so Earnest in their Desires to  serve  him for the Value of  Threepence  Whereas in the Country he must first tell People what he wants and tho' he lays out Three or Four Shillings he has hardly a Word spoke to him unless it is in Answer to the Questions he is forc'd to ask them This  Alacrity  in his Behalf moves his Gratitude to all the Watermen and being unwilling to  disoblige any  he knows not which of them to pitch uponI have  seen  a Man  think  all this or some∣thing like it as plainly as the Nose in his Face And move along all the while very contentedly under a  Load  of  Solici∣tors  carrying down to the Waterside with a smiling Countenance  Seven  or  Eight Stone  more than his  own Weight  THERE is something so strongly touch'd so  picturesque  and so diverting in these Two  Descriptions that I cou'd not resist the Temptation I was under to send 'em you with my Request That you would publish them in one of your PLAIN DEALERS Where if I am not mistaken they will make a very agreeable Figure  I am SIR Your constant Reader and humble Servant  TERENTIUS  The Plain Dealer No  Furit alter amore  MANIL  Nascentes morimur finisque ab origine pendet  Ibid  MONDAY  February    IN the Decision of that Important  Questi∣on What is strongest  which we read of in the Sacred Writings  LOVE  and  DEATH  stand out  distinguish'd  And two of my Correspondents have given me an Opportu∣nity  of placing both these  Invincible Powers  in full View near one another A Position which like the  Contraste  observ'd in the  Poetry  or  Painting  of Judicious  Masters  sets off and throws forward every Object by its OPPOSITE and  rounds  and  raises  to the Eye what without such artful Disposi∣tion might be lost and lie too  flat  to catch the Notice of a slight Remarker  I SHALL introduce the  Lover's  Letter by a Reflection concerning the Impossibility of  describing  Love and the Benefits which  So∣ciety  owes this Passion from a Poetical PICTURE of it which I have more than once made mention of in the Course of these Papers  The  roughest  Passions  gently  learn to move  And Savage Hearts are  humaniz'd  by  Love  Love  in a  Chain  of Converse bound Mankind

Pleasure in reading it such just  Sentiments  and your  peculiar Method  of  Plain Dealing  must charm the intelligent and give Satisfaction to every one who is susceptible of Tenderness and Good Na∣ture  AMONG the Subjects which you have cursorily touch'd on LOVE that Hea∣venly Passion notwithstanding your  grand Climacteric  seems to claim a considerable Share in your Composition else how could you so tenderly express your self concern∣ing the Affair of  Lucinda  With what En∣ergy did you Discourse Humanity ap∣pear'd in every Word and I believe it im∣possible for the most Ardent LOVER to speak of Love with greater  Emotion  than you did in that Beautiful PLAIN DEALER  I HAVE for some time been  in Love  with a Woman invested with all the Gra∣ces which accomplish the Sex And as I am entirely  devoted  to that Passion when I read that Paper of  Lucinda  I felt within me something  new  That argued still for  Love  something so natural so moving that it was impossible for one in my Circum∣stance to withstand it The Opinion I had already conceiv'd of my  Beautiful Di∣sturber  heighten'd by a growing and ver∣tuous Passion made me a Thousand times delight my self with an Imagination that my  Emilia  resembled  Lucinda  The Love I bear this most agreeable Woman has so deeply rooted it self in my Heart that nei∣ther  Time  nor  Accident  can eradicate itAll my Thoughts center in her and when  absent  from  her  I have lost the  Soul  that  animates  my  Life  and my  Mind  is as effe∣ctually  Dead  as my  Body  will be when  I am no more  and shall have learnt the Pow∣er of  forgetting  her  MY Passion for this  dear Creature  has been sometime  Dormant  About two Years ago my Affairs obliged me to go Abroad when our Acquaintance was but little cultiva∣ted yet an Infant Passion even then made me solely  her  Admirer Such  Beauty GoodNature Wit  and lively  Conversation  as are rarely to be met with in one Person so captivated me that I could think of nothing but the  dear Emilia  When I  return'd Home my Passion encreased daily insomuch that at this Time I am a Stran∣ger to every Thing in the World but  Love  and  Emilia  without  her  I shall be the most unhappy Man aliveI dread the Thoughts of  her  being  unkind  and Hea∣ven grant they may be groundlessI have declar'd my Passion to  her  and if I don't flatter my self she  appears  to have some regard for me this you will readily conclude gives me  Hope but  alas  I fear  too or I shou'd be  no Lover  OUR Circumstances are very different and we seem in this Case only to be  Diffi∣dent  in one another As for my Part a  genteel Employment  is the only Fortune I have to trust to and therefore according to the laudable Custom of  Bargain  and  Sale  in the Affair of  Marriage  I am afraid I have too  little Plea that Way  yet she is entirely at her own Disposal and can  with∣out asking any Body Leave  make me the  happiest Man on Earth  Dear Mr  Plain Dealer  as you have been an Advocate for  Lucinda  I beg a little of your Assistance What must I do without her I am inevi∣tably lost and am afraid it may be so if you don't intervene with your  good Advice  I beg you to publish this in your next it may have some Effect on the  dear Emilia  I am almost perswaded she does not  hate  me And yet when I reflect on the  merce∣nary Ways of the World  I am plung'd into the utmost  Despair  SIR As you are a Man of Reason make not  light  of my Condition but exert your self to  assist  me I am afraid I have exceed∣ed the Bounds of a Letter pray correct the Mistakes in Sense I forget every Thing but the  dear Emilia  Angels  protect  her and make her  kind  Your Advice how to proceed will be very grateful and your publishing This save me a great deal of Confusion For she will know it comes from me by a Declaration in it which none else can perceive  I am SIR Your constant Reader and humble Servant  C K  THERE is no Spectacle more  profita∣bly  terrible than that of a Man who lies  expiring  his  Soul  on his DeathbedTo see how the Spirits shrink inward and retire to the Heart which is beating with convul∣sive Anguish while the Hands and Feet its most  remote  Dependancies are  first incolden'd  to a  fashioned  Clay as if Death  crept in at the Nails  and wou'd by Surprize from both  Extreams  make sure of the  vital Center  THE  Mind  would fain  utter  it self but the Organs of the Voice are so debilitated that it  cannot  The  Eyes  now settle to a dim Fix∣edness  which but a little before was as swift as the Shoots of Lightning as nimble as  Thought  and as bright as the polish'd  Dia∣mond  The  Countenance  through which per∣haps there shined a  lovely Majesty  even to the Captivating of admiring Souls is alter'd in∣to  frightful Paleness  and the Languor of a ghastly StillnessThe  Tongue  is  silent  which commanded a Family nay perhaps a  King∣dom  and kept every Thing in Awe with the Importance of its MotionThe  Form  that was Yesterday so graceful is now become a Thing so full of  Horror  that  Children  are afraid to look upon it and must therefore be transmitted from its Pleasures and its Pas∣sionsfrom all the Scences of its inchant∣ing Blandishments to a dark and silent  Grave  THERE is even the Difference of  two seve∣ral Worlds  betwixt a King  enamel'd  with his Robes and Jewels sitting in his Imperial  State  and his Posture Figure and Condition when consign'd to his Six Foot of Royalty to his  Box  of everlasting Obscurity And yet this  Change  is without any visible substan∣tial  Diminution  All the  Limbs  remain per∣fect as they were without Dislocation or ContractionWhence  Scaliger  defines Death to be but the  Cessation of the Soul's Functions  As if it were rather a  Restraint  than a  Disso∣lution  What seems wanting is chiefly  Colour Heat  and  Motion  yet that gross Object which is left to the Spectator's Eyes remains  remains now but a Compound of the two ignobler Elements  Water  and  Earth  while the two purer  Fire  and  Air  are winged away as fitter Attendants on the  Soul  than on the extinguish'd  Body  WHEN this happens to one whose Conver∣sation hath indeared him to us when we see his Eyes  put on Death  and hear the  tolling Bell  give publick Notice of it what Soul can  then  lose a Thought on the fugitive Joys of  Pleasure  What a  Bubble  what a  Puff  what a  Wink  of  Life  is Man And with what a general and sure Success does Death stand over Humane Nature always  striking  here and there and exercising an unbounded  Triumph  I HAVE lately from such a Sight as  This  learnt both  Humility  and  Elevation  The One to lower my Esteem of a  Body  which must one Day perish in unlovely  Rottenness  The other to Reverence a  Soul  which af∣ter having liv'd here but as a  Sojourner  reas∣cends when its House of Flesh is demolish'd with a Vigour as unrestrain'd and an Essence as refin'd and glorious as the  unimbodied  and coelestial  Angels

of a  narrow Spi∣rit  The  Destroying Half the Merit of his Purposes by an ungraceful Manner of Executing them  And he has so often taken Delight to put me coarsely in mind of his  Charity  That he  robb'd  me even of the  Comfort  which  He laid out his Money to procure  me  THIS last  Christmas  being seiz'd by a violent Fit of the  Gout  he was roaring out one Day in Extremity of  Pain  and  Peevishness  He cou'd not he said  imagine  how so  temperate  a Man as  He  was shou'd come by such a Distemper as the  Gout  If he had been a  Glutton  or a  Drunkard  he shou'd not have wonder'd at itBut for a  SmallBeerDrinker  One who had always been  remarkable  for his  SelfDenial  to fall under the Torture of  such a Disease as the Gout  It was very hardIt was very strangeAnd he cou'd not  for his Part  tell how it was to be  accounted for  IT was my GoodLuck at that Time to have been newly reading a Collection of  Miscellaneous Poems  and I bethought my self of something that I met with in it which had pleas'd me very much and made an Impression on my MemoryI ran and fetch'd the Book and opening  it to the Place put it into my  Uncle  's Hands and told him He might there find the  Reason  of that  Misfortune  he had been complaining ofHe desir'd me to read it to him and I did it as follows  "THE Learned  Sydenham  do's not doubt  "But  PROFOUND THOUGHT  will bring the

January    SIR  THE only Account I shall give you with Regard to  myself  isThat I am a  Fellow  of one of the  Colleges  in this  University  my chief Design in Writing bing to strengthen you with some  new Ma∣terials  for the better Performance of that Promise you were once pleas'd to make us of  proving  that the  Women  are a great deal  wiser  than  We are  MY Father very lately sent me down into the  Fens  to  make Love  to a young Lady who is Mistress of a considerable Fortune Where I discover'd to my no small Mortifi∣cation That All my  Learning  hitherto has  taught me Nothing that deserves Compa∣rison with the  Universal Knowledge  which I met with in that discreet and profound FamilyNot  Heaven  alone but  Earth Air Fire Water Birds Beasts Stocks Stones  Every Part of the still or moving mute or speaking  Creation  has contribu∣ted to the  Erudition  of my more than ac∣complish'd MistressAll Things been  laid open  to her if not in their  Natures  I am sure I may say in their  Meanings  IN short after Three Days unsuccessful Endeavours to fathom my Fate with Re∣gard to this  infallible  Lady I am come back to my College almost too  humble to wish for  the Possession of a Blessing so  uncommon  I saw a  female Dwarf  in my Mistress's Neighbourhood and could not help think∣ing while I was looking on her and listen∣ing to a little History of her having been  serv'd up in a GoosePye  That this Pocket  Abridgement  of  Womanhood  might as mo∣destly pretend to incorporate Herself with one of the  Gyants  in the King of  Prussia  's  frightful Regiment  as I to  match my Mind  with one whose  Comprehension  is so vastly too  big  for me  AT my first coming I was receiv'd by an  old Maiden Aunt  who is Mistress of the Ceremonies to the Lady I was recommen∣ded to she surpriz'd me with a Declara∣tion That she  knew of my coming before she receiv'd my Father's Letter  I said I  thought it had been a  Secret  but she assur'd me That I had been  hanging for a whole Week past upon one of the Bars of the Kitchen Chimney  Not being intirely  En∣lighten'd  as to the  Authority  of this dark Prognostick I was preparing to ask a Que∣stion or too but was  scar'd  out of the Intention by a melancholy Denunciation  That my Father wou'd not live to see the Match come to Perfection  for this Good Lady had the Night before this Letter was brought to her  seen it coming in Both her Candles with a WindingSheet just overagainst it  I BOW'D with a becoming  Sorrow  and receiv'd the Prophecy with all that  Re∣verence  which was due to so  extraordinary a Reason  This won her to a Warmth in my Interest and she would carry me without Ceremony to  surprize  her Neice in the Garden where she was visiting her  Orange Trees  in the  GreenHouse  We were got as forward on this pleasing Journey as to the outside of the Garden Door when some or other of those  busy Powers who envy Lovers their propos'd Enjoyments  put it in∣to the Old Lady's  Feet to stumble over the Threshold  upon which she turn'd back in a Fright and push'd me  in  again with such  Care  and  Kindness  that I can never suffi∣ciently  thank  her since if I had  gone on  after such an  ominous Warning    and met my Mistress in an unlucky Minute  All the  World it seems from that Time forward could never have made it possible for me to  come near her in a  LUCKY  one  SHE overtook us however as soon as we were got back into the Parlor and broke in upon me with such a  Flash  of  Charms  that as I saluted her I was struck dumb with  Rapture  out of which I reco∣vered in Time to overhear her tell the Old Lady as she was passing round her to a Chair  That it was not I that had drawn open her Curtains when the BrideCake was put under her Pillow  I was not yet skil∣ful enough to know what  Good  or  Ill  this  boded  me But before we were fully seated a new Misfortune had befallen usMy  Clarinda  's  Chair tumbled backward  upon which she declared to me with the prettiest Resignation in the World  That she was not to be  LADYMAYORESS  this Year  but had  Patience  to support herself under all such Disappointments  BEING now got into perfect Composure I began to find that I was  looking silly  So I sigh'd three Times and inform'd her as well as I cou'd of the  Great Respect my Fa∣ther had for the Family  And  Clarinda  on her Part had open'd her Fan to its full Extent and was looking down upon it in the proper  Attitude  and telling the Sticks with both Fingers when the Aunt inter∣rupted me with a Groan that had been unluckily mention'd by my naming my  Father  and confirm'd her former Remark of the  Winding Sheet  by a  Death's Head she had found out in the Fire  As  Great Misfortunes  rarely come  single  a malicious Coal  in the Shape of a Coffin  flew just then to  Clarinda  's Feet who turn'd pale and took it up betwixt a Finger and Thumb and after throwing it  behind  her over the  left  Shoulder corroborated her Aunt's Evidence by a  DeathWatch  that had kept her  waking  By the  howling of a Dog  all Night longBy a deep  Grave  that he had scratch'd up at the Foot of a  Rosemary  Bush exactly under her Window  AND now their Eyes being turn'd on Me as if they expected my Opinion I gave it them very gravely  That these Things had somewhat in 'm  and it was happy for me that I said no  less  for an Old Family Servant with a sober mournful Face having heard Part of the Discourse while he was busy about the Fire very dismally confirm'd our Terrors by Three Proofs which were stronger than allFirst by the  squeaking of a Weasel  that had met him upon the  CellarStairs  Secondly by a  Hole that the Rats had gnaw'd in the Back of his best Livery  And Thirdly by a strange  Dream  that Mrs  Susan  the Cham∣bermaid had been almost frighted out of her  Wits  by about  Wet CloathsThree MinistersRipe Fruitand Roses in Blossom  After all which to put it abso∣lutely  out of Doubt and  convince  us  That somebody wou'd die shortly  he shew'd us on one of his Hands a dirty  yellow Spot  which the Thumb of his other as he shook his Head and observ'd to us was not  broad  enough to  cover  and this they all agreed was no better than a  DeathMould  and  must mean something  IN the midst of these  Miseries  I had very little to say for my self having been  put out  of a premeditated  Speech  which I had been inventing during my whole Jour∣ney but as  GoodLuck  wou'd have it the  Tea  came in to my Relief and the first  Dish  that had the Blessing to approach  Clarinda  's Lips was so richly cover'd with  Moneybags  floating in white Circles all over the Surface that  Gayety  took Place of  Melancholy  A little  Spider  too was so kind as to  spin down GoodLuck into her Lap  which methought meant  me  no Harm Nay I became on a sudden so happy that her  Elbow  declar'd in my Fa∣vour and her Aunt put her to the  Blush  by observing  she must change her Bedfellow  BUT let no Man be too much in  Haste  to conclude that He is  happy  My Tri∣umph was  dash'd at once  by a Discovery That  this was ChildermasDay  After which my Mistress said no more but that  Nothing wou'd come to Good that was begun on that worst Day of the Week  So her Teeth ach'd  most prodigiously  She was sorry she cou'd be  no Company  and took her Leave of us till next Morning  NEXT Morning cameand the first Person I met was Mrs  Susan  whom I dis∣cover'd cross the Hall spitting seriously in her Hand and shutting it close with a great deal of Caution for Fear of  letting slip  as she afterwards told me a  Sign  she had felt in her Palm that a  handsome Gift  was very near herI was glad of this favourable Opportunity to confirm the  Truth of that Token  and she was so oblig∣ingly  Communicative  as to intrust me with two great Secrets  One  That  I had trod upon her Lady's Toe  last Night in the Hurry of waiting on her to the Stairfoot whence a Conclusion had been drawn in my Fa∣vour  That I shou'd come e'er long to her Bedside  The  other  that Mrs  Susan  ha∣ving discover'd this very Morning That one of her Lady's  Stockings  had been  put on wrongside outward  was forbid pulling it off again for Fear of  turning some GoodLuck that was meant her  Mrs  SUSAN  in Return for her kind Intelligence was very Earnest to know whether I had  dreamt of no Body  I told her I had had the Happiness to be all Night in  Her Lady's Company  And I cou'd perceive that this Information was no more than had been expected which led me into some probable Guesses con∣cerning the Purpose of a  CaseKnife in a  CommonPrayerBook  which when I got up in the Morning I had found  under my Bolster  While I held this Conference with my  FellowServant  we had the Plea∣sure of bidding our  Mistress Goodmorrow  and of hearing to my no small Comfort That her  Foot  as she came down Stairs had given her the Signal  That she was to tread upon strange Ground  IN fine Sir it is impossible for you to conceive what an infinite Variety of  Notices Impulses  and  Prognosticks  outward and inward these Ladies direct their Conduct byIn my Three Days stay which I thought enough for my first Visit I cou'd learn nothing with any certainty of what I chiefly sought to know but was edified above Measure in the  Occult Sciences of the Family  My Mistress call'd after me when I had taken Horse to come away that she was afraid I shou'd have a  wet Jour∣ney  for  Puss was washing her Face  and carried her  Paw above her Ears  which she assur'd me was a  Sign  that had never been known to miscarryWhether she meant this as a Display of her  Art  or of her  In∣clination to bring me back again  is a Myste∣ry which notwithstanding the great Ad∣vance I have made in  guessing  I am yet unable to disclose with any positive De∣pendance  BUT I wou'd not for all that have you think slightly of my  Skill in Tokens    since I cou'd  astonish  you if I thought fit with a Profusion of  portentous Mysteries  I am absolutely Master of that  oraculous  Secret which is  kneaded up  in the  Dumb Cake  I am instructed in the  aweful Cere∣monies  which are sacred to the fam'd  Saint Agnes  to the Purity of whose mysterious Worship  Three Fasting Virgins  must concur with so strict an Abstinence That a KISS during those restrictive  Rites  wou'd be as  Undoing  as a RAPE after they are over I can foretell the most agreeable Things in the World by  Six Peashells over a Door  And anticipate Consequences which wou'd puzzle a  Southsayer  by  turning Three Times round in my Shirt and falling into Bed backward  I know who will die an Old Maid by the Help of a  Grey Goose Wing  a  Clean Hearth  and a  Seive full of Ashes  BUT I shou'd never have done were I I to let you into the Virtues of  Roses ga∣ther'd on Midsummer Night  of  Hempseed sown  and  mow'n in the Dark upon the Graves of a Country ChurchYard  of  patch∣ing a pretty Face with AppleKernels  of  Cutting the Nails fasting  of  twisting a Garter in Nine Knots round a BedPost  of  a Certain Hair that you may find in your Shooe the first Time you hear the Cuckoo  and a Thousand other  deep Discoveries  which I have made in this delightful Journey And which have put me quite out of Conceit with my former Studies since after having  labour'd  to be  wise  so many Years in a  Col∣lege  I found my self notwithstanding little better than a  Fool  as often as I came into my  Mistress's Company  PRAY Sir favour me with your Opini∣on  how far I may prudently venture my self  with a Lady so much wiser than I am Your Advice will have its weight with  Your humble Servant  AEMILIUS  The Plain Dealer No  Non quicquid turbida Roma  Elevet accedas  PERS  FRIDAY  February    WE had once a Species of  Opera  call'd  Dramatic  in which the Dignity of  Reason  was not sacrific'd as it is now to the Dissoluteness of  Sound  but the Force of  Words  and  Meaning  was increas'd by  Mu∣sick  and  Decoration  and impress'd upon the Soul by the Mediation of the  Senses  I HAVE heard with a Pleasure which I hope was not groundless That there is a Design on foot in one of our  Theatres  to restore these manly as well as delightful Entertainments with an Elegance and Mag∣nificence of Ornament which we have not yet been accustom'd toThe Success which  Dioclesian  has met with an  Opera  of  this Kind  but far short of the Perfection which I am told it is propos'd to raise to them to will serve it is to be hop'd as an Encourage∣ment to keep the Gentleman who is  Pa∣tentee  of that  Theatre firm  and  vigorous  in his IntentionHis Genius is admirably turn'd to those Embellishments of  Show  and  Scenary  which will always have a surprizing and powerful Effect on the  Stage  but  most  where they are aptly and significantly in∣troducedAnd there are not wanting  Writers  who can contribute  Subject  and  Oc∣casion  whereon to exhaust in the most rational as well as agreeable Manner the sprightly Copiousness of his Invention So that I am almost led to flatter my self That our emas∣culating present Taste of the  Italian  Luxu∣ry and  Wantonness  of  Musick  will give way to a more  Passionate  and animated Kind of  Opera  where not only the  Eye  and  Ear  may expect to be  charm'd  but the  Heart  to be touch'd and transported  IT will be receiv'd as the Effect of  Spleen  or  Affectation  to insinuate That the Martial Spirit of our Nation is effeminated and gra∣dually  relax'd by the Influence of this sof∣tening  Syren  And yet  Cicero  who was at least as good a Judge as most of the Mem∣bers of our  ROYAL ACADEMY for En∣couragement of TRIFLING  has not scru∣pled to say plainly in his Tract  de Legibus  That  the Good or Evil in a State depends greatly on the MUSICK that is most en∣courag'd in it For if it be too Light and Wanton the People are insensibly render'd foolish and disorderly and on the contrary if it be Grave and Masculine they become modest by its Influence  THE  Spartan  Plainness and Austerity have been celebrated in every Age And Histories are full of Instances of that Wise People's Ri∣gour against  Innovation  in Particulars which seem'd to threaten them at what Distance soever with the modish Luxuries of their Neighbours But the strongest Impression which was ever made upon me in their Fa∣vour was from the Decree they passed against  Timotheus  the  Milesian  for an  Improvement  he had introduced in  Musick  much like the admir'd  Concerto's  of our  Italian Benefactors  But these Grave  Men of Foresight  discern'd the Consequences of such pretended Refine∣ments and provided against it by this time∣ly  Edict  with  Lylius Gyraldus  has inserted as he transcrib'd it from  Boetius  FORASMUCH as  Timotheus  the  Milesian  receiv'd into our City holding  in Contempt the ancient  Musick  and re∣jecting the  Harp with Seven Strings  hath introduced an  Harmony of many Voices  cor∣rupting the Ears of our Youth by a Mul∣tiplicity of Strings and a Musick hitherto unknown  Dividing the Simple Notes  into a Variety of  Feints  and  Quaverings  We do therefore Ordain That he shall be  impeach'd  and that his superfluous Strings  shall be broken  To the End that  Strangers  from  his Example  may be wary of bringing among  Spartans  the light and unmanly Amusements which are practis'd in  less modest Countries  WHEN I reflect on the Power of Musick as it was practis'd among the Ancients and consider the miraculous Instances of its Ef∣fects on the Passions of some Princes who were most inflexible in their Resolutions And when at the same Time I consider That the Musick which had this prodigious Influence was the Reverse as I shall pre∣sently prove of That which now prevails in  Europe  and which produces none of those  transporting Effects  What less can I con∣clude than that All our boasted Additions to this heavenly Art are rather  Enlargements  than  Improvements  There is a little Piece of  Randolph  's which of all his Poems I am most pleas'd with and which gives us as it were in  Miniature  the whole that can be said of Musick  Musick Thou Queen of SoulsArise and string  Thy powerful Lute and some sad  Requiem  sing  'Till  Rocks re murmur  an awaken'd  Groan  And  list'ning Tempests  catch the mournful Tone  Then on a sudden with excursive Hand  Fly  o'er the  sounding Chords  with  Light  command  'Till  Oaks  and struggling  Elms  uprooted  bound  And a charm'd Forest  lives  and dances round  Thenin the  midst  of the transporting Strain  Strike a  sad Note  and fix 'em  Trees  again  I SAID above That the strange Effects reported of  Musick in former Times  were the Influence of a Practice very different from the  modern  and I cannot more effectually strengthen that Assertion than by observing I am confirm'd in it by the Opinion of Dr  Wallis  communicated on this Subject to the  Royal Society  THE Musick of the Antients was more  ex∣tensive  than ours For  Poetry  and  Dancing  or measur'd Motion were then accounted Parts of  Musick  Now we know that  Verse  if harmonious and passionate  set  to a  plain Tune  and sung by a  natural Voice  with some  soft Instrumental Musick  such as not drowns or obscures but heightens the  Emphatick  Expressions will work strangely upon the Ear and move all our Passions in Proporti∣on to the  Tune  and  Subject  but especially if attended with suitable  Gesture  and  Action  For 'tis evident on the  Stage  that proper  Acting  gives great  Life  to Words Now all this  together  which made up the Ancient  Musick  must needs operate strongly on the Fancy and AffectionsFor if the delibe∣rate Reading of a Romance if it happens to be well penn'd will produce  Mirth Tears Pity Anger Indignation  according to the respective Intents of it much more wou'd it do so if accompined with all those power∣ful Assistants  WHY may not all This be  now  done as well as  then  No Doubt it  may  and with equal  Effect  too if the  Words  were but elegantly adapted to the  Argument  and dispos'd in Places proper for their  Emphasis  pronounc'd with a tuneful  Voice  and inlivened by ex∣pressive  Gesture  painting naturally the Pas∣sion or Condition of the Mind and  gra∣phically delineating  as it were to the  Eye  as well as addressing to the  Ear  the Bounds Distinctions and peculiar Attributes of  Joy Grief Wonder Fury Jealousy Compassion Fear Love Hatred  and the rest of those Emotions which the acted Mind is subject toThis wou'd as certainly  now  as  then  produce extraordinary Effects and especially upon a  Surprize  where Persons are not preju∣dic'd or preengag'd and so lie open to the meant Impressions  OUR modern  Musick  is no more than what the Ancients call'd  Harmonick  which was but one Part of  Theirs  whose  Musick  as I said above consisted of  Words Verse Voice  Tune Instrument  and  Action  A very pow∣erful CombinationAnd can we expect from  One Piece  the same Influence as from the  Whole  The Design of  Musick  among  Us  seems to aim at exciting no  particular Passion  but in general to  please the Ear  and by a tuneful Intermixture of  different Voices  and  Parts  with  Cadencies  and  Con∣cords  produce an  elegant Sound  which only those Persons can discern who have distin∣guishing  Judgment  in  Musick  while That much larger Part of the Audience which consists of Those who have a  rude  and un∣cultivated  Ear  remains only amus'd and confounded with a  great Noise  which has Nothing distinguishable to their Capacity  'TIS true indeed that even this  Compound Musick  admits of  Characters  very different Some are  brisk elate  and  airy  some  sedate  and  grave  others  soft resign'd  and  languid  But still That kind of Harmony which is most powerful to excite particular Passions or Dispositions in the Mind is the  simple natural  and  uncompounded  How often have I been forced to go abroad when I had no mind to it or  fall asleep  in the middle of the Day by a  Nurse's languid Tune  lulling her Babe to rest in a Room within my hearingNay continual Reading in an  even Tone  the soft Murmur of a pebbly Brookthe falling of Rain upon Treesshall have an irresistable Power to induce a Repose upon the SpiritsAnd on the contrary an  derman  who is lame of the  Gout  shall feel himself grow light and wanton at the brisk∣ness of a  Jig  on a  Kit  or  Violin  exciting a Disposition to  dance  that is almost too hard for his  Pain  and  Gravity  Nothing is plain∣er therefore than that  simple Harmony  is more operative on the  Affections  than an ela∣borate  Composition  of  Full Musick  SO that if it is the Aim of  Musick  to  please the Ear  the Compositions of  Italian  Masters may deserve to be  preferr'd  as form∣ing  sweeter Consorts  than were known to the Ancients among whom I find no Footsteps of what we call  several Parts  or  Voices  such as  Base Treble Mean  c sung in Consort  answering  each other to diversify and fill up the MusickBut if we mean by  Musick  to excite Passion and move the Heart to any moral or solid Purpose we must apply a more touching  Simplicity  and endeavour to act  upon Nature  in a more  natural  and unaf∣fected Manner And This I doubt not a judicious  Composer  may so happily effect that allowing for those  Hyperboles  with which the Antient Writers set off their Musick our Modern may be found capable of producing as extraordinary Effects as theirsAnd  This  methinks is a  Mine  of  Pleasure yet un∣open'd  and may deserve to be thought on with some Attention by Those whose  Pro∣fit  wou'd be the certain Consequence of in∣troducing a  Novelty  so powerfully attractive But I shall say more concerning these Things upon some future Occasion  The Plain Dealer No  O Imitatores servum pecus  HOR  veteresmiratur laudatque poetas  Idem  MONDAY  February    To the  PLAINDEALER  SIR  THERE is a dishonourable Kind of Practice among the Men who style themselves the  Wits  which I can no longer forbear complaining against as an Abuse that deserves the Notice and Correction of a PLAIN DEALERYou must needs have observ'd that our  Poets  are like our  Politicians  divided into opposite  Parties  and draw their Pens with great Sharpness to the Defiance of each other's  Muses  Among these Warriors on both Sides there are a turbulent Sett of People not  Soldiers  but  Engineers  who are known by the Name of  CannonTurners  They never  trouble themselves to provide  Wit of their own  but are sure by some Stratagem to steal  That of their Enemies  and apply it to a Purpose the Reverse of what it was intended forThe only Difficulty they are at is to substitute the Word TORY in the Place of the Monosyllable WHIG without Detriment to the  Measure  of the  Verse  or to crowd the unpliable Stubborn∣ness of PRESBYTERIAN into the passive Com∣pass of JACOBITE For when these little Difficulties are once happily adjusted they have turn'd the Malice of their Adversary's Meaning directly  against Themselves  and by killing with this  good Husbandry  save the Expence of Artillery  BUT it were well Mr PLAIN DEALER if these  CannonTurners  wou'd confine the Exercise of their invertive Talents to our private and  Domestick  FactionsOn the contrary They are never so active as when we are at  War  with any of our Neigh∣bours The  French  in particular have been very great Sufferers by them and have complained That these  CannonTur∣ners  are the only  unfair Fighters  that this Nation ever sent against them  I SHALL better clear to your Apprehen∣sion what Justice there may be in their Complaint by producing one Example of many where the Wit of their own  Ma∣gazines  has been  purloin'd  in a most un∣soldierly Manner  and discharg'd upon them  to their no small Damage  MONSIEUR  Maynard  a  French Writer  in the Time of Cardinal  Richlieu  's Admini∣stration found himself forgotten or neg∣lected having been a Favourite in the former Reign tho' this great Cardinal was nobly liberal in the Encouragement which he gave to Men of Merit Monsieur  May∣nard  had a Spirit too exalted to importune with personal Addresses a Minister whose  Levees  were so overcrowded and to whom he was no otherwise known than by the Fame of his  Writings  He therefore sent him in the following  Verses  a Memori∣al so full of  Praise  without  FlatterySatyr  without  Malice  and  Submission  without  Meanness  that I have never met with a Mixture of so  artful  a  Wit  with so  delicate  a  Severity  and it was impossible for it not to have produc'd the Effect which was expected from it even tho' it had been address'd to a  Chief Minister  by many Degrees  duller  than  Cardinal Richlieu  I  Sick of a  Life  possess'd in vain  I soon shall wait upon the  Ghost  Of our  late Monarch  in whose Reign  None who had  Merit  miss'd a  Post    II  Then will I charm him with  your  Name  And all your glorious  Wonders  done  The  Pow'r  of  FRANCE  The  SPANIARD's Shame  The rising  Honours  of  His SON  III  Grateful the Royal Shade will smile  And dwell delighted on your Name  Sweetly  appeas'd  his  Griefs  beguile  And drown  Old Losses  in  New Fame  IV  But when he asks me in what  Post  I did your  wish'd Commands  obey  And  how  I shar'd your  Favour most  What wou'd you please to have me say  BUT now Sir almost a  Century  after the Death of both  Poet  and  Patron  comes a famous  English CannonTurner  or Abettor of  CannonTurners  nam'd  Bernard Lintot  and from a Magazine call'd  A Miscellany  dis∣charges all this Wit against the Honour of it's  Author's Country  The first Part being  general  it will be needless to trouble you with it but the Three last  Stanza's  run in this Manner  IV  The Warriour Ghosts will round me come  To hear of Fam'd  Ramillia  's Fight  While the vex'd  Bourbons  thro' the Gloom  Retire to inmost Realms of Night  V  Then I my Lord will tell how  you  With  Pensions  every Muse inspire  Who  Marlbro  's Conquests did pursue  And to his  Trumpets  tun'd the  Lyre  VI  But shou'd some  drolling Sprite  demand  Well SirWhat Place had you I pray  How like a  Coxcomb  shou'd I stand  What wou'd  your Lordship  have me say  I SHALL take up none of your Time with Observations on the  Lower Turn  and more  ungenteel Spirit  with which the Ap∣plication of this borrow'd  Wit  is made which in the Original is so  nobly graceful  All I wou'd say farther on the Subject is That since he who makes bold with  ano∣ther Man's Money  will naturally be sup∣pos'd to have had  none of his own  I am in Pain upon these Occasions least when the  French Wits  observe the Freedom we have taken with  Their Property  they shou'd conclude us  All  to be  Poor  rather than  some  of us  Ungenerous  I am SIR Your very humble Servant  FRANCIS FAIRPLAY  To the  AUTHOR  of the  PLAIN DEALER  Mr  PLAIN DEALER  I HAVE seen with a great deal of Plea∣sure some Excellent  Specimens  of the antient  Hebrew Poetry  distinguish'd in your Paper with the Applause which is so justly due to them For every Body who weighs these Things with Judgment must agree with a late Writer That  there is nothing so soft so tender and pathetick and at the same Time nothing so grand so majestick so terrible and so harmonious as the Poetick Part of the  BIBLE  I SEND you one of their  Lyrick Odes  which is the  Song  of  Moses  on the Over∣throw of the  Egyptians  in the  Red Sea  and I believe it will be readily allow'd That there is more of the  Sublime  in this  Hebrew Ode  than can be found among the  Writings  of any  Greek  or  Roman  Poet  Temples and Altars let us raise  Our Father's God is  Ours  and claims our  Praise  God is our  Strength  Be

praepediuntur  Crura vacillanti tardescit lingua madet mens  Nant Oculi clamor singultus jurgia gliscunt  LUCRET  FRIDAY  February    THE following Letter from the same learned and ingenious Hand to which I am indebted for that which was publish'd in a former Paper N  o  concerning the Difference observable in Point of  Fortune  be∣tween the Professors of Poetry and of  Paint∣ing  contains so useful a Lesson against a Folly that is become too common among us That no Subject cou'd be more seasonable or stand more in need of a PLAIN DEALER The Letter in its Original was directed to a  particular  Friend of the Writer's But Pro∣duc'd an Effect which renders it deserving of a more Extensive and  Publick  Notice  SIR  I SHAL now according to my Promise which I made you on the Seventh of this Instant and which I hope came to your Hands give you some Account of the strange Ravage which is made by  Excessive Drinking  in the Bodies and Minds and Af∣fairs of those who are addicted to that  Barba∣rous Vice  NATURE has contriv'd it so That all her Children as long as they retain their  Reason  are fond of  Life  and at the same Time they all believe that Life it self of which they are so fond is a  grievous Bur∣then  without the Benefit of  Health  but tho' all Men are satisfied of the unspeak∣able  Value  of  Health  yet few are frugal Managers of it But the  Drinking  Part of Mankind are as Prodigal of it as the  Squan∣derer  is of  Money  For no Vice whatever does so much Harm to the Body or lays the Foundation of so many Diseases as Excessive Drinking  Gout Stone Cholick Fevers Consumptions Vapours Asthma's  with a long  et caetera  A CERTAIN Friend of Ours whom we love very well has drunk himself into no less than  Three  of them  viz Gout Asthma  and  Vapours  and yet he goes on in his old Course as if th  Juice of the  Grape  like that of the  Scor  on  could expell the Ve∣nom which befo  e it infus'd but here I  think my self oblig'd to declare that I mean by  excessive Drinking  a constant daily or frequent Drinking to a greater Quantity than is sufficient to cherish Nature  ALL the rest of the Vices together are not so often punish'd by sudden Death as excessive Drinking alone is which some∣times happens by the Malignity of the Vice it self oppressing and stifling Nature and sometimes by the fatal Accidents which attend upon it as false Quarrels  c  OUR Friend whom I mention'd above has no less than  Twice  to my Knowledge very narrowly escap'd  sudden Death  which had like to have happen'd  both Times  by Excessive Drinking once formerly in  Lin∣colnsInnFields  and another Time lately at  S  Now as a Death that gives no Time for Repentance ought to be look'd upon as the greatest of all Punishments Excessive Drinking ought to be regarded as the greatest of all Vices because we ought to believe That Divine Justice has propor∣tion'd  Punishments  to the  Crimes  for which they are inflicted and because there is no Vice by which he who uses it so imme∣diately Defaces or so totally Destroys in himself the  Image of God  which is  Rea∣son  I hope that upon reading this you will have the Goodness to admonish our Friend who has so narrowly escap'd  twice  to beware of a  third Time  AS the State of the Mind depends upon that of the Body and the Motions of that Particle of Heavenly Fire upon the Motions of the animal Spirits which in time of  Health  move Vigorously and Regularly and Weakly and Irregularly in time of  Sick∣ness  it must necessarily be that  That  Vice which is the Occasion of most Diseases in the Body must be likewise the Cause of most Disorders in the Mind And there is no Vice that is so great an Enemy to the  Understanding  as excessive Drinking or that so often entirely  Overturns  it Indeed Drinking to Excess while the Fit continues sometimes strengthens the  Imagination  but by the same Degrees by which it  raises  the Imagination it  Depresses  the Judgment the former of which is common to us with  Beasts  and the latter with  God  and  Angels  But then the Day  after  Drinking the very Imagination languishes with the Judgment And Drinking to Excess never fails  in time  to  Quench  the Imagination to  impair  the Memory and to drown the Judgment  I DESIRE that you would admonish one of our Friend's  Capacity  to take Notice That  Bacchus  is often a great  Leveller  that he levels the Understandings of  Wise  Men and  Fools  of the Blockhead and the Man of Sense and that therefore as 'tis the In∣terest of Fools to carry on this Vice 'tis the Interest of Men of Sense to avoid it  I DESIRE that you would likewise put Him in mind that the same  Drunken Deity  is often  worse  than  a Leveller  that he is often a  Subverter  of the Order of Things and pulls down the  Rich  and exalts the  Poor  that is he gives Understanding to  Fools  and makes Men of Sense  Madmen  For Fools having generally stronger Nerves and less volatile Spirits than Men of great Understandings or of Beautiful Imaginati∣ons the same Quantity of Spiritous Liquor that will set Fire to the Phlegm of Fools and by that Means  rouse their Capacities  will make Men of Sense either  stupid  or  frantick  AS there is no Vice which more impairs the Understanding and weakens the Reason there is none which more inflames the Pas∣sions and disorders the  Will  Several other Vices are  Solitary  and each of them shuns the Company of the rest but excessive Drinking is attended with the very worst of them that is with those which have the directest Tendency to the Misery and De∣struction of Men as  Gaming Quarrels Riots Murders  c  MOST  other Vices  are  compatible  with several  Virtues  but Drunkenness runs Coun∣ter to all the Duties of Life A great Drinker is for the most part neither a good  Husband  nor a good  Father  nor a good  Son  nor a good  Brother  nor a good  Friend  BUT 'tis not  Virtue  only that  Detests Drunkenness  'tis often abhorr'd even by  Vice  it self as by  Avarice Hypocrisie Am∣bition  Bigottry  and  Lust  As this unnatural Sin of Drinking is attended with several that bring Misery and Destruction on those who use them as has been said above 'tis often shunn'd by that Human  Natural Vice  which tends to the Propagation of Mankind as much as it is by  Vertue  For there is nothing so Inconsistent or Incompati∣ble with excessive Drinking as the Cleanness Elegance and Delicacy of a  Courtly Gallantry  AS the Right Management of Human Affairs requires Health of Body and Vi∣gour and Serenity of Mind we ought not to wonder if a Vice that breaks the Rest in him impairs the Understanding de∣stroys the Memory inflames the Passions and debauches the Will entirely unquali∣fies a Man for doing what the World calls  Business  And therefore hard Drinking has ruin'd more  English  Families than all the rest of our Vices put together not by the immediate Expence which attends upon the Vice but by altering the very  Natures  of the Heads of Families who use it and mak∣ing them unfit for the Management of their Affairs of which they were very capable be∣fore For other Vices indeed make Men  worse  but a Habitude of excessive Drinking often alters Men to that Degree That they become the  very Reverse  of what they were before and differ more from their  former Selves  than from their  present Companions  Such a Habit when it has been long con∣tracted  has often made the  Ambitious  indo∣lent the  Prudent  inconsiderate the  Active  idle and the  Industrious  slothful and negli∣gent So that their Affairs are ruin'd for Want of  Application  or by being intrusted in the Hands of those who turn them wholly to their own Advantage and to the Ruin of those who employ them  AS  Personal  Vices are the Cause of pri∣vate Calamities so  National  Vices are the Grounds of National Sufferings And as no Vice does more Harm to particular Constitu∣tions than frequent Drinking to Excess or lays the Foundation of more Diseases and of more ill Humours in them there is none of our publick Vices which does more Harm to our National Constitution or occasions more Corruption in it than this pernicious Habitude And as this Custom in particu∣lar Persons causes them to neglect their pri∣vate Affairs and either to leave them wholly undone or to leave them to be done by those who will make their proper Advan∣tage of them tho' to the Ruin of those who entrusted them as has been said above the same Thing is not unlike to happen to this Drinking Nation  TO be satisfy'd of this if we may judge of the Future by the Past we need only cast an Eye back upon our  Elections  in which Thousands of  Englishmen  as far as in them lay have sold their own  Liberties  and the  Liberty  of their  Country  for  Liquors Esau  sold his  BirthRight  for a  Mess  of  Pottage  but then He sold only his  own  BirthRight and he sold it to his  Brother  and he sold it to  support Nature  in the  Extremity  of  Hunger  But Thousands of our  Electors  have sold as far as in them lay not only their  own  BirthRights their  own  Liberties but the Liberties and BirthRights of  their Brethren  for nauseous Loads to  oppress  and  destroy Nature  I know indeed very well that upon those Occasions in order to cor∣rupt People there is a little of the  Solid  made Use of sometimes as well as a great deal of the  Liquid  But I have a better Opinion of some of my Countrymen than to believe That they would  sell  their  Wives  their  Children  and all their  Posterity  for a  Song  if at the Time when They  did  it They were  cool  enough to consider  What it is they are about  THUS my dear Friend have I endea∣vour'd to shew the Mischief which excessive Drinking does to particular Persons in their  Bodies Minds  and  Affairs  I should say something of the  unreasonable Apologies  which the  Disciples  of BACCHUS make for them∣selves But having run into more Length than I first intended I shall defer what I had to say farther 'till I have heard how you relish what I have already writ  I am  c  London  September    The Plain Dealer No  Modó Vir modó Foemina  VIRG  MONDAY  February    SIR  AS I have taken Notice in the Course of your  Plain Dealing  That you are perfectly appriz'd of the General Disposition among Those whom we call  People of Qua∣lity  to patronize and distinguish  Merit  I flatter my self that you will contribute what Assistance may be in your Power to the Encouragement of a  Work  I am at present engag'd in and which the World may expect to see publish'd very speedilyI intend in short To compile a HIS∣TORY of DEDICATIONS containing a particular Account of all Addresses of That Kind which have been made to the  Noble Patrons  of the present Age Whether  Dukes Marquesses Earls Viscounts Simple  Barons or under what Name or Title so∣ever known and distinguish'd Together with certain  Edifying Remarks  upon their graceful Manner of  Receiving  and judici∣ous Liberality in  Rewarding  such Addres∣sers From which a reasonable Judgment may be form'd concerning the  unusal  En∣couragement  Polite Learning  is like to meet with throughout the Course of the present Generation  GREAT Numbers have already sent me in  Memoirs  of their own particular Expe∣rience And I doubt not in the least but that I shall be able to compose a Volume which will not only  do Justice  to the very extraordinary Times we live in but asto∣nish and inflame PosterityIf you Mr PLAIN DEALER or any of your Friends have  wherewithall  to oblige the World on so illustrious an Occasion be  communicative  for the  Honour  of your Country and con∣firm me still more  Your Friend And constant Reader  HUMPRHY PICKTHANK  I MUST be plain with my industrious Correspondent Mr  Pickthank  and let him know without Ceremony or Circumlo∣cution  That I have an irreconcileabe Quarrel to the  Subject  of his History And shall contribute no  Memoirs  to its  Orna∣ment  If he is desirous to know my  Rea∣son  I shall give it him in the Words of a merry Friend of mine who took Occasion some few Years since to  dedicate  to a  Great Man  his Thoughts concerning  Dedi∣cations  YOUR  Dedicators  says this  Wag  are a sort of  intellectual Taylors  that  cut out  Cloaths for a Great Man's Mind without ever taking Measure of itThey have but  Two Rules  and Those they never depart from First The Dress must be  Gaudy  And Secondly It must  never Fit  But they must make it of a  vast Dimension  and cover it all over with  Tinsel  METHINKS I shou'd congratulate the Men of  Quality  on this  Advantage  which it must of Necessity be to them to have their Characters drawn only by such as do not or  dare not  know them And will consequent∣ly be sure not to put their  Graces  their  Lordships  and their  Ladyships  out of Coun∣tenance A convenient Piece of Good Breed∣ing For which I hope They are thankful  AS for my self when I see a long Drift of  Excellencies  and  Talents  cramm'd down the Throat of an  Innocent Nobleman  who has done nothing to  deserve  such Ill Usage I am  not at all surpriz'd at it Because I am assur'd it is not meant to the Disadvantage of the  Person  of  Honour  it is address'd to but is a mere Declaration of the  Author's Wants  and a heavy Complaint against Hunger and Nakedness  THE only  Dedications  therefore which I am for encouraging are Those which may instruct the Receiver that he is to consider them as  Bills  of  Exchange  drawn by the  Witty  upon the  Great  and payable at SightAnd least the Offering shou'd be misun∣derstood or not recompens'd as it ought to be through the deplorable Ignorance of some People whose high Quality has plac'd them above the Reach of  Knowledge  and the Im∣pulses of  Humanity  I have for the Benefit of my worthy Companions in the Labours of the Standish drawn up a  Form  which I would  have  annex'd to all future  Dedications  where the  Fortune  is in any considerable Degree more Elevated than

large several Parcels which I have not  Item'd  Which will raise the whole  Value  to at least  even Thirty Pounds  and I have drawn a Bill upon your Lordship accordingly which I hope you will pay at SightI might have found Chapmen for these Goods among others of the  Quality  as unprovided as your Lordship But out of  pure Respect  I was resolv'd you shou'd have the  Refusal  I am  My LORD  Your Lordship's most oblig'd Most obedient most devoted Most  c PAUL POORWIT  IN this plain Manner says my ingenious Friend and old Acquaintance wou'd I have  Authors  treat their  Patrons  The said Thirty Pounds may probably be the Poet's  whole Stock  and  Wits  dealing the least upon  Credit  either in buying or selling of any  Trading People  in the World have the more Occasion for  Ready Money  A LITTLE Reflection on the foregoing Particulars will convince the laborious Mr  Pickthank  that nothing is more unreason∣able than his Expectation of my Assistance towards setting forth a  History  of such  Dedi∣cations  as I can by no means approve the  Examples  of But am desirous to see suppress'd in Favour of a  Juster Method  which I have therefore recommended  To the Gentleman that writes the

my Part I have no great Skill yet what Difference there may be between one sort of Men and ano∣ther But I listen when any of these  Wits  are talking with my Father because he says They can teach me Things That I shall be the wiser for as long as I live  ONE of the prettiest of them all was reading to us yesterday some ingenious Copies of Verses out of a Book of Poems that is just come out and I think he told us it was writ by a Gentleman whose Name is  Baker  They were particularly delighted with one little Poem among the Rest at which They all  laugh'd  as if they were  mad  And said it was one of the  Cleanest Turns  They had met with And my Father cou'd not rest till he had taken a Copy of it  I OBSERV'D that my Mother and my Eldest Sister  blush'd  while they were laugh∣ing at it But I tho' I stole it out of my Father's Pocket the same Night and have read it over and over till I have got it by Heart can make nothing of it and am vex'd because I  want Understanding  to find out the Meaning of something that my Si∣ster who is but three Years older pre∣tended to  look learnedly  at as if she knew forsooth as much of the Matter as Any∣body  I AM asham'd to ask  Questions  about it at home for Fear of being found out to be Sillier than I shou'd be at my YearsAnd therefore I bethought my self to beg the Favour of  you  to shew where the  Clean∣ness  of That  Turn  lies that my Father and his  Wits  were so highly diverted withI know a Place where they take in your Pa∣per and where I shall see your  Answer  without any Body's knowing that it was I who writ to you about itI never writ to a  Man  before but my  Father  and there∣fore pray don't wonder at any Ignorance or Mistake in  Good SIR  Your Admirer and humble Servant  NOVINDA  The FEATHER  IN his  Forimel  's Arms as if quite out of B  eath  I'll kiss thee my Charmer I'll kiss thee to Death  Cry'd  Thirsis  in RapturesBut soon on her Breast  He sunk down his Head and compos'd him to Rest  Not long had they lain thus unactive together  E're the  Wanton  pluck'd out from the Bolster a  Feather  And grasping him hard 'till he open'd his Eyes  In a Tone of Derision the witty One cries  To prevent being kill'd in the Manner you said  I resolve with THIS FEATHER to chop off your Head  PS  There may be  Wit  in this for any Thing I know but if a Man was for  Cut∣ting my Head off  and had nothing in his Hand but a  Feather  I shou'd think my self a  Great Fool  to be  afraid  of what he cou'd do to me  MADAM  WHEN a young Lady of so lively and industrious a Curiosity becomes desirous to learn  Meanings  she makes much swifter Advances than you can easily ima∣gineNot to rob you therefore of the Honour of a Discovery you cannot fail to make shortly by Virtue of your own natural Genius Please only to wait till the Week after your next BirthDay and if by That Time you shall not be as  knowing  in this Point as the young Lady your Eldest Sister Command all Instruction in the Power of  Your most obedient Servant The  PLAINDEALER  The Plain Dealer No  Quid non Mortalia Pectora cogis  Auri sacra Fames  VIRG  FRIDAY  February    THE Force of  Avarice  is never so con∣spicuous and so much to be wonder'd at as when it taints the Minds of Persons eminent in Quality and Circumstance secu∣red as one would think against all mean Temptations by the large Revenues of a  State Employment  It is no such great Mat∣ter of Surprize when we see this Tincture of Covetousness prevailing in a  Mechanick  one whose Birth and Education are upon a Level one who has undergone a State of Servitude who has learn'd to be scraping and penurious by Habit and Example and who by a Conversation with Dirt and servile Gain makes the amassing a Fortune to be the chief End of Life But we expect from a Gene∣rous Birth and a Liberal Education Senti∣ments suitable to their Dignity  WE see 'tis true this  dirty  Passion often  blotting  the  Escutcheons  of the Noblest Fami∣lies And we find at the same time our  Re∣spect  for their  Quality  turn'd into a  Contempt  for their Persons But how much more de∣spicable does this Vice appear when we find it lodg'd in the Breast of Him whose sup∣pos'd Merit and the Favour of his Prince have raised him to preside in  Justice  We at∣tach Idea's of Veneration to their Characters who are  Oracles  of  Law  We look upon them as the Storehouses of Wisdom and the Fountains of Integrity And were they as it is said of the old  Persian  Emperors to appear in Publick but once in Seven Years the Vul∣gar no doubt would carry up their Respect to the Pitch of  Adoration  BUT our Deference for these Great Men is taken off when we see Frailties breaking thro' their Grandeur When they prostitute the Sanctity of Honour and Conscience to Wealth and unworthy Extorsion My Lord  COKE  I remember somewhere speaking of  Extortion  in a  Judge  says It is there worse than Robbery For  Robbery is apparent and hath the Face of a Crime but Extortion puts on the Visor of Vertue for Expedition of Justice  IT is a very fine Aphorism and worthy the Consideration of all Ages and Countries That  a Judge ought to be season'd with two Sorts of Salt the Salt of  Wisdom  lest he should appear a  Fool  and the Salt of  Consci∣ence  lest he should appear a  Devil I cannot help recollecting upon this Occasion a Pas∣sage of  AELIAN  who speaking of the  Egyptians  tells us  'That they boasted to have receiv'd their System of Laws from  Mercury  And that their Judges whenever they sate upon the Decision of Causes wore hanging upon their Breasts by a Chain of Gold a Sa∣phire Image which was call'd  Truth  But  says the Author  I should think it better that instead of the  material  Image dangling at their  Bosoms  they had the  Essence  of it stampt on their  Souls  I WAS led into this Trace of thinking by Perusal of those Pamphlets which have lately been publish'd concerning the famous Lord  BACON  and of another I met with in the Window of a  Member  of  Parliament  which is call'd  The  CASE  of  ORPHANS  consider'd from Antiquity  THE Title Page tells us That a Part of of its Subject is  On the Court of Chancery having the Disposition of Orphans Money  As I observ'd some Passages in it concerning the unreasonable Trust which has been put in the  Masters  of  Chancery  I shall take the Liberty of transcribing a few and making them a Part of this Day's Entertainment  I MUST freely confess  says this Author  it is always my Opinion That a Lord CHANCELLOR was a most proper  Trustee  and  Guardian  of the Interests of  Orphans  and  Widows  I have not altogether retracted this Opinion but I am so diffident of my own weak Judgment that strong Clamour and strong Arguments perswade me often not to be too positive or tenacious of my Sentiments I am not so perfectly me∣thinks reconcil'd to a CHANCELLOR and his  Masters  having too intimate an Understanding with Each Other And I begin to suspect it a Degree of  Harmony  in no wise essential to the Promotion of  Equity  IT has been as I am told but by a very modern  Order  that the  Suiters  Monies have been lodg'd in the Hands of the  Ma∣sters  and it may be to be wish'd that too many have not Cause to be sorry an Order of that Kind ever took Place  THO' there be a loud Cry of  Deficien∣cy  in the  Suiters  Money so lodg'd I am not taking upon me to impeach the Chara∣cters of those Gentlemen but only to ob∣serve That that  Order  seems to have been as absurd and unreasonable as it has prov'd unhappy in its  Consequences  The Posses∣on of large Sums of Money and the dis∣cretionary Power of approving what Secu∣rities they shall be plac'd out on is a Trust of such a Kind as might debauch the Prin∣ciples of Minds not the most strongly in∣trench'd in Honesty against the Assaults of Avarice and Advantage It gives a Li∣berty which I hope was never taken of  making Interest of that Money in which they have no Property and for which they are barely Trustees and at the same Time of not paying One Shilling of its Produce to the right Owners under Colour that they have not had any proper Security pro∣pos'd upon which they could certify it safe and fitting to place it out  WERE there not the unhappy  Defici∣encies  which are at this Time talk'd of I think several Cases of Conscience might arise upon the Possiblity of the  Masters  Conduct with Regard to this Trust Sup∣pose only for Example during the late unaccountable Fluctuation of  Stocks  when the  SouthSea  Frenzy was at the Height and  Money  yielded the Interest of a  whole Year  for the Loan of a  few Hours  any im∣mense Fortunes had been made by the clan∣destine Application of those very Monies for which no Securities could be found or those very Monies had been lost in an un∣warrantable Venture for private Profit What Reparation should have been made to the  Suiters  or  Orphans  whose Estates in either Case were so  happily  or  unhappily  employ'd Would they have reap'd the Be∣nefit of the first  Stockjobbing  or was there the least Reason that they should sit down with the Loss of the  Latter  I make this but a Case of Supposition and as it is scarce probable that the same Frenzy should ever again possess us yet should it the  Wisdom of our PARLIAMENT is providing That the Monies of  Orphans  and other  Suiters  engag'd in  Chancery  shall not be subject to such Hazards  BUT so much for Quotation As I have abovemention'd the Name of the Lord  Chan∣cellor BACON  who was accus'd by the Na∣tion of  Bribery  and  Extortion  I shall add a a few Words here with Regard to his Con∣duct under that Accusation It has been rec∣kon'd very singular in his Case and He has been look'd upon as a Man of many  Fears  that he should desert his  Defence  and by a  Submission  and  Confession  of his Guilt throw himself on the Favour of the Parliament But my Lord  BACON  who as it has been observ'd knew that all Wounds ake with laying open and that Circumstances are sufficient to blast a Reputation was resolv'd to avoid the Hazard of a publick Examina∣tion It may very often be wiser to carry Defects private than to stand too perempto∣rily on a Justification wherefore I look up∣on the Saying to be of great Weight  That no Man has so many Faults as he that takes upon him to have none at all  THIS puts me in Mind of a FABLE that I read in my younger Years and which I shall relate here because I am resolv'd not to end with too much Gravity  THERE was a Knot of good Com∣panions that enter'd into a Club under certain Rules and Orders for the Go∣vernment of the Society One Article among the rest was  "That whoever should enroll himself a Member of that  Brotherhood  with any corporal  Maim  or  Blemish  about him should forfeit a Crown to the Board and for so many Defects so many Crowns"  It fell out that  one  Man in the Company was observ'd to go  Limp∣ing  and they call'd upon him for his  For∣feit  The Man put himself upon the Test and was found in the Search to have not only one Leg longer than the other but a  Scurff  all over his Body Upon this Disco∣very they demanded another Crown and then another for a GlassEye he had They press'd him in the End so hard for the Mo∣ney that it came to  Stripping  and upon that Struggle they found he had a Rupture  So that the further he push'd his Defence his Contest become more Chargeable  The Plain Dealer No  Animum curis nunc huc nunc dividit illuc  VIRG  MONDAY  March    To the  Author  of the  PLAIN DEALER  SIR  YOU were pleas'd in a late Paper to thank Heaven that  All  our Lords are not  Lords  of  Trade  For my Part I wish heartily that Eight or Nine Gen∣tlemen of my Acquaintance were  All Lords  They fall so naturally into  Airs  of  Grandeur  and are already so  adroit  in the Exercise of  Authority  that They would strangely  become  the Dignity I wish 'em pos∣sess'd of and I shall never be truly Easy till I see 'em preferr'd to Offices of much less  Trouble  than their Present and more proportion'd to their Merit and Abilities  YOU must know Sir that I am  Agent  for one of our  American Colonies  and owe  to the Duties of that Station the Opportu∣nity of being perfectly well acquainted with the  Patience  the  Experience  and indefatig∣able  Application  of most of Those  Fast Friends  to the  Plantation Interest  to the  Ease  the  Wellfare  add above all to the  Good Government  of their  Dear Brethren  in the Western WorldI have receiv'd a thousand Proofs of the surprizing  Tender∣ness  and  Moderation  with which They act in Matters which carry any Severity in their Appearance And on the other Hand of the kind Vigour and Resoluti with which They forward every Motion that but tends to the Encouragement or Satisfaction of their Countrymen in those remote but important SettlementsI am not able therefore to  express  the Gra∣titude I  feel  for Benefits too long and too many to enumerateBut because we see Things clearest when oppos'd against their  Contraries  Indulge me but so far as to tell the World a  Story  for me which will teach the Enemies of these  Great  Pro∣moters of the Publick Good to value them as they ought and see what Diffe∣rences there is between  Them  and other People  ONE of the  Turkish Sultans  whose Name I have forgot taking into his Con∣sideration the Great Fertility of  Egypt  was resolv'd to give Encouragement to the  Trade  and  Plantations  of That Country  To this End he sent over to the  Bashaw  of  Grand Cairo  a SETT of SAGES with  great Salaries  to whom  References  were to be made upon all Transactions of that Na∣ture And by whose  Reports  He was to guide himself in  Mercantile  and  Commer∣cial  Cases  IT happen'd soon after their Arrival that a Petition was presented to the  Bashaw  by the Planters of  Cotton  whose whole Year's Expectation had been destroy'd by an unusual Inundation of the  Nile  In Commiseration of which deplorable Acci∣dent They humbly pray'd a Remission of the Tax upon Cotton for That one Year onlyThe  Bashaw  according to His Orders referr'd This Petition to the  Sages  who were  with all convenient Speed to exa∣mine its Contents and report their Opinion what might fitly be done upon the Occasion  THE  Sages  justly mindful that the li∣beral  Salaries  which were annex'd to their Office intitled the People for whose En∣couragement they were appointed to the most affectionate Proofs of their  Favour  and  Good Nature  were not wanting to lay hold on this inviting Opportunity to con∣vince the Petitioners how Greatly the Estab∣lishment of so able a  Board  of  Counsellors  was like to conduce to the Interest not only of the CottonPlanters but of all the Plantations in generalThey there∣fore most humbly certified to the  Bashaw  That the Loss of the Cotton appear'd in∣deed to have been very considerable But seem'd rather an Effect of the  Planter's own Negligence  than of the  River's Inun∣dation  since they cou'd not but know there were many  Seeds  and  Grains  not liable in their Growth to receive Damage by  Inundations  And in particular  Wool  they said was  Waterproof  They were therefore humbly of Opinion That it wou'd be for the  Good  of the  PlantationInterest  that no Regard shou'd be shown to the Prayer of the Petitioners since they ought instead of  Cotton  to have SOWN WOOLL and thereby secur'd them∣selves against the Misfortune which had ruin'd them  I KNOW Mr PLAIN DEALER That You are a  Man  of  Business  and will therefore take up no more of your Time at pre∣sent But referr to another Occasion what Observations I intend to make on the  Story  which I have here sent you  I am SIR Your neverfailing Reader And humble Servant  COLON  To the  PLAIN DEALER  SIR  IF ever there was such a Thing as the  most Charming Woman in the World  I have found her out and am in Love with her beyond all  Meaning Thought  or  De∣scription  I had naturally no Genius to Poetry but what can't  Love  make possibleMy Mistress whose  Wit  is as amiable as her  Beauty  is a great Friend of the MUSES and us'd often to reproach me That I had never  writ Verses  upon herShe went so far at last as to tell me down∣right That she would never be married to to a Man who had not  lov'd her to some Tune  I readily guess'd at her Meaning and presented her the next Morning with the following SONG which I assure you was of my  own making  I  AS  Damon  sat by  Sylvia  's Side  And watch'd her Eyes with amorous Pride  He gently bow'd his leaning Head  And while It prest  Her charming Breast  Thus the transported Shepherd said  II  Thou smiling Cause of  Rest  and  Pain  The Youth who  loves  not lives in vain  What Charms have  Eyes  where Wishes  meet  Where Souls combine  And Two Hearts join  Hope  is unbounded  Joy  compleat  III  No  Lamb  of all thy  bleating Care  Looks  softer  than  Thy Passions  are  Possessing  Thee  By Thee  possess'd  I fear no  Pain  I wish no  Gain  Who that's in  Heav'n  wou'd  MORE  be  bless'd  NOW Sir the Occasion of my troubling You is only to know Whether you can teach me any Method of finding out what a Woman has a Mind to  hide  I can't for my Life guess Whether she likes  me  or my  Song either  Before I made it she was for being  lov'd  to  some Tune  And now All I can get from her is That she will be admir'd  beyond Measure  In my Opinion these two Things are  Inconsistencies  but one that is in Love is so apt to be mistaken that I won't take upon me to be  positive  till I know what  You  think of it And so in Hopes of hearing from You very speedily I  rest  Ah noI mean I  remain  SIR  Your most obedient Servant  MYRTILLO  The Plain Dealer N  o    Nam dolor morbus Lethi fabricator uter∣que est  LUCAN  FRIDAY  March    To the  Author  of the  PLAIN DEALER  SIR  A DEAR Friend of mine having late∣ly lost a hopeful and beloved Child and remaining inconsolable thereupon I beg you'll please to insert for the next  Paper  the following Abstract of  PLUTARCH's  Letter to his WIFE on a like Occasion The sorrowing Parent is your constant Rea∣der and I know no better Way to calm the Violence of her Grief than by convey∣ing to her by Your Means and under the Sanction of your Authority so many ex∣cellent and  familiar  Things as flow'd from that Great Man on this melancholy Occa∣sion Which may at the same Time in∣spire our Sex with an Ambition to imi∣tate the Virtues of  PLUTARCH  's Wife  and so to deserve the Applauses he gives Her I am  SIR  Your constant Reader and Admirer  ARTEMISIA  PLUTARCH  to his  WIFE All Health  THE Messenger you dispatched to tell me of the Death of my little Daughter it seems miss'd his Way as he was going to  Athens  But when I came to  Tanagra  I heard of it by my Niece I suppose by this Time the Funeral is over I wish that whatever happens as well  now  as  hereafter  may create you no Dis∣satisfaction But if you have designedly let any Thing alone depending upon my Judgment I pray let it be without  Ce∣remony  and  timorous Superstition  which I know are far from you Only dear Wife let  You  and  I  bear  our  Affliction with Pa∣tience  I KNOW very well and comprehend  what Loss  we have had but if I should find you  grieve beyond Measure  this would trouble me more than the Thing  it self  For I had my Birth neither from a  Stock  nor a  Stone  and you know it full well I having been assistant to you in the  Educa∣cation  of so many Children which we  brought up at  Home  under our  own Care  THIS much lamented Daughter was born after Four Sons which made me call her by your  own Name  therefore I know she was dear to you and Grief must have a  peculiar Pungency  in a Heart  tenderly af∣fectionate  to  Children  especially when you call to Mind how  witty  and  innocent  she was void of  Anger  and not  querulous  She was naturally  mild  and  compassionate  to a Miracle and gave Specimens of her  Humanity  and  Gratitude  towards  any Thing  that had oblig'd her for she would pray her Nurse to give suck not only to  other Children  but to her very  Playthings  as it were courteously inviting them to  her Ta∣ble  and making the best Chear for them she could Now my dear Wife I see no Reason why  these  and the  like  Things which delighted us so much when she was alive should upon Remembrance of them af∣fect us when she is dead  IT is but just That the same Arguments which we have oftentimes used to  others  should prevail upon  ourselves  at  this  so  sea∣sonable  a Time and that we should not supinely sit down and overwhelm the Joys we  have tasted  with a Multiplicity of  new Griefs  A vertuous Woman ought thus to think with herself That the Tem∣pest of the Mind in violent Grief must be calmed by  Patience  which does not in∣trench  on the  natural  Love of Parents to∣wards then Children as many think but only struggles against  disorderly  and  irregu∣lar  Passions For we allow this  Love  of  Children  to discover itself in  lamenting wish∣ing for  and  longing after  them when they are dead But the  excessive Inclination  to  Grief  which carries People on to  unseemly Exclamations  and  furious Behaviour  is no less culpable than  luxurious Intemperance  Yet Reason  seems  to plead in its Excuse because instead of  Pleasure Sorrow  is an  Ingredient  of the  Crime  What can be more Irrational I pray than to check  ex∣cessive Laughter  and yet give a free Course to  Tears  which flow from the  same Foun∣tain  FORMERLY you discover'd on a  like  Occasion great Constancy of Mind when you lost your  Eldest  Son And again when the lovely  Ch  ron  left us For I remem∣ber when the News was brought me of my Son's Death as I was returning Home with some  Friends  and  Guests  when they beheld  all Things in Order  and observ'd a  profound Silence  every where as they after∣wards declared to others they thought  no such  Calamity had happened but that the Report was false So  discreetly  had you settled the Affairs of the House at that Time when no small  Confusion  and  Disorder  might have been expected And yet you gave  this  Son  suck  yourself and endured the  lancing of your Breast  to prevent the ill Effects of a Contusion  THESE are Things worthy of a  Generous Woman  that  loves  her  Children  Whereas we see most  others  receive them in their Hands as  Playthings  with a  Feminine Mirth  and  Jollity  and afterwards if they chance to die they drench themselves in  excessive Sorrow  Not that  this  is any Ef∣fect of their  Love  for that  gentle Passion  acts  regularly  and  discreetly  it proceeds from a  Desire  of  Vainglory  mixed with a  little natural Affection  which renders their Mour∣ning  barbarous  and  extravagant  Which Thing  Aesop  knew very well when he tells the Story of  Jupiter  's giving Honours to the Gods For it seems  Grief  also made  her  Demands and it was granted That she  should be honoured  but only by Those who were willing of  their own Accord  to do it  AND indeed  this  is the Beginning of Sorrow Everybody  first  gives her  free Ac∣cess  and after she is once  settled  and be∣come  familiar  she will not be forced thence with their  best Endeavours  Therefore she must be resisted at her  first Approach  nor must we surrender the Fort to her by any  exterior Signs  whether of  Apparel  or  sha∣ving  the  Hair  or any other  such like  Symp∣toms of  mournful Weakness  which by De∣grees so  enervate  the  Mind  and reduce her to such Streights that quite  dejected  and  besieged  with  Grief  the poor timorous Wretch  dare not  be merry or see the Light or eat and drink in Company The Inconvenience is accompanied by a  Neglect  of the  Body  with whatsoever relates to the  Elegance  of  Humane Life  Whereas on the contrary the Soul when it is  disordered  ought to receive  Aid  from the  Vigor  of a  healthful Body  For the  sharpest Edge  of the  Soul's Grief  is  rebated  when the  Body  is in  Tranquility  like the Sea in a Calm But where from an ill Course of Diet the Body becomes  dry  and  hot  so that it can∣not supply the Soul with  commodious  and  serene Spirits  but only breathes forth  me∣lancholy Vapours  which annoy her with  Sad∣ness  there it is difficult for a Man tho' never so willing to recover the  Tranquility  of his  Mind  after it hath been disturbed with so many  evil Affections  BUT that which is most to be dreaded in this Case does not at all affrighten me to wit The  Visits  of  foolish Women  and their accompanying You in Your  Tears  and  Lamentations  by which they  sharpen  Grief not suffering it either of  itself  or by the Help of  others  to fade and vanish away For I am not ignorant how great a Combat you lately entered when you assisted the Sister of  Theon  and opposed the Women who came running in with  horrid Cries  bringing  Fewel  as it were to her Passion When Men see their Neigh∣bour's  House  on Fire every one contributes his utmost to  quench  it But when they see the Mind inflamed with furious Passion they bring  Fewel  to  nourish  and  increase  it When a Man's  Eye  is in Pain he is not suffered to touch it tho' the Inflammation provoke him to it nor will they that are near him meddle with it But he who is gall'd with  Grief  sits and exposes his Di∣stemper to  every one  like Waters that all may poach in and so that which at first seem'd a  light  or  trivial Smart  by much  Fretting  and  Provoking  becomes  great  and  incurable  I WOULD have you endeavour to call to Mind  that Time  when our Daughter was not as yet born to us Then joining  that  Time with  this  argue thus with your self we are  now  in the  same  Condition as  then  Otherwise dear Wife we shall seem discontented at the  Birth  of our little Daughter if we own that our Circum∣stances were better  before  it The  Two Years  of her  Life  are by no means to be forgotten by us but to be numbered amongst our  Blessings  in that they afforded us an  agreeable Pleasure  Shall we not esteem a  small Good  because of a  great Evil  or Shall we ungratefully complain against Fortune for what she has  actually given us  because she has not added  what we wish for  Certainly to speak reverently of the Gods and to bear our  lot  with an  even  Mind  without  accusing Fortune  always brings with it a  fair Reward  And he who in such a Case calls  prosperous Things  to Mind and turning his Thoughts from  dark  and  melancholy  Objects fixes them on  bright  and  chearful  Ones will either quite  extinguish  his  Grief  or by  allaying  it with  contrary  Sentiments will render it more  feeble  TRUE  Happiness  consists in the  right Counsels  of the Mind tending to its own  constant Establishment  and the  Changes  of  Fortune  are of no great  Importance  to the  Felicity  of our  Life  if we are govern'd by  exterior Things  and with the Vulgar have a Regard to  Casualties  we suffer  any kind  of Men to be Judges of our Happiness it will certainly ill become us to accuse our Life if like a  Book  it hath but  one Blot  in it and all the rest be  fair  and  candid  DO not You therefore take Notice of the Tears and Moans of  such  as  visit you  at  present condoling  your Misfortune for their  Tears  and  Sighs  are but  of Course  Rather consider How happy every one of them esteemed you for the  Children you have  the  House you keep  and the  Life you lead  For it would be an ill thing while  others  covet  your  Fortune tho'  sullied  with this  Affliction  that you should exclaim against what you  enjoy  and not be sensible from the  Taste  of  Affliction  how grateful you ought to be for the Happiness which remains  un∣touched  Or like some who collecting all the  defective  Verses of  Homer  pass'd over at the same time so many  excellent Parts  of his Poems So shall we peevishly  complain of  and  reckon up  the  Inconveniencies  of our Life neglecting the  Benefits  thereof Or Shall we imitate  Covetous  and  Sordid  Misers who having heap'd together much Riches never  enjoy  what they have in  Possession  but  bewail it  inconsolably if it chance to be  lost  BUT if you lament the poor Girl be∣cause she died  unmarried  and without  Off∣spring  you have wherewithal to comfort your self in that  You  are defective in none of these Things having had  Your Share  And these are not to be esteemed  great Evils  where they are  wanted  and  small Benefits  where they are  enjoyed  So long as she is gone to a Place where she feels no  Pain  she has no Need of our  Grief  For what  Harm  can befall  us  from  her  when she is free from all  Hurt  And surely the Loss of  great Things  abates the Grief when it is come to this  That there is no more Ground of Grief or Care for them  But thy  TIMOXENA  was deprived but of  small Matters  for she had no Knowledge but of such neither took she Delight but in such  small Things  How then can you say That  that  is taken from her which she never was  sensible  of and which never so much as entered into her  Thoughts  As for what you hear Others say who persuade the  Vulgar  That the Soul when once freed from the Body suffers no In∣convenience or Evil nor is sensible at all I know that  you  are better grounded in the Doctrines delivered down to us from our  Ancestors  For the  Religious Symbols  are well known to us who are of the Fraternity Therefore be assured That the  Soul  being  incapable of Death  suffers in the Body in the  same Manner  as  Birds  that are kept in a  Cage  Wherefore  Even when we first receive our Breath  'Twere good to pass the Gates of Death  Before too great a Love of  Earthly  Things be engendred in the Soul and it become soft and tender by being  used  to the Body and as it were  incorporated  with it  The Plain Dealer N  o    Lectorem delectando pariterque monendo  HOR  MONDAY  March    To the  Author  of the  PLAINDEALER  SIR  WHILE I intended to have sent you an  Essay  on  PlainDealing  I fell in∣to a Conversation which furnished me with it and the Narrative will be thought a more lively Entertainment The Society was composed of some of your old standard Friends whose agreeable Characters gave Life to your UnderstandingI was car∣ried thither to have the Honour of being introduced to the  Plain Dealer  but it seems you were taking Observations from your WatchTower of  Barbican  concern∣ing which I make no doubt we shall hear something to our Advantage and so as it happen'd I miss'd the Pleasure which had  been promised me However as your Ad∣mirer I beg to be admitted into the Num∣ber of your Correspondents while I inform you That the Company I met were the  Clergyman  the  Critick  Major  Stedfast Ned Volatile  and your own dear  Patty Amble  THE good Gentleman in Black took Occasion from our Speaking of the Title of your Paper to distinguish a  Plain Dealer  from a  Rough Dealer  That is a Man whose Knowledge and Generosity inspire him with a Delight in befriending Man∣kind from the brutal Impertinent whose Ignorance but  affects  Meaning and prompts him to suppose he appears Wisest when most insufferably Shocking The Virtues of  Plain Dealing  said he are by awkard Imi∣tators debased into IllManners and In∣humanity The Brute who boasts of his  Bluntness  is a loud Censurer of other Mens Conduct and never right in his ownHis Eloquence is a Froth of Expression without Depth or PerspicuityWhile his Depravity mistakes Brutalities for Beau∣ties the Graces of human Life are rejected by him as Frailties Because his own Na∣ture is impenetrably obdurate he calls Ob∣stinacy  Magnanimity  Compassion for the Afflicted is a  Weakness in the Mind  and a Readiness to forgive Injuries an  Affectation  or  Deficiency  of  Spirit  The  Plain Dealer  refining  Nature  by Principle acts the Inquisitor within him∣self  and throws out a Light of Example as well as Instruction upon the WorldThe Former insults the Unfortunate with Censure but the Latter reproaching only the Proud and Prosperous  corrodes  not the Wounds of the Afflicted by insisting on past and irretrievable Miscarriges Yet by some gentle Allusion to their Actions he awakens a Reflection that can arm them for their future SafetyWe judge of Things impartially upon a Surprize by such Comparison and condemning our own Faults in others are forced to stand selfconvicted when the  Recoil  is made up∣on our selves  But the Barbarity of a  profound Pedant  is still worse if possible than that of a  shal∣low Impertinent  The Ignorance of the one can only move us to Contempt but the Learning of the other provokes our Dete∣station Tho' Envy may hurt Genius by urging it in the Disguise of Flattery up∣on too ardent and improper Essays yet in the dogmatizing Pedant it has shock'd Worth much more fatally at its first setting out and extinguish'd a Spirit which no Encouragement could rekindle A Pe∣dant ungratefully turns that Force to the Discouragement of Learning with whic  Learning has arm'd him to make War against IgnoranceWhile the  Plain Dealer  reproves he sets  Merits  against  Er∣rors  and the  Lustre  of the one deepens the  Shade  of the other To display but the dark Side a Man either damps him with a Ter∣ror that incapacitates him for Action or disgusts him into a stubborn Indulgence of those Follies he would otherwise have grown ashamed of Roughness in Conver∣sation being like Persecution in Religion Proselytes are gain'd soonest by a gentle Manner of Persuasion and I am pleas'd with a Saying that is recorded of King  Henry the Fourth  of  FranceA Drop of Honey draws more Flies than a Spoonful of Vine∣gar  IN short the Force of a fine Instruction ought to strike like a Flash of Lightning As the Subtilty of the one is said to dis∣solve the Bone without bruising the Flesh the other with a Surprize of Influence shoots Remorse thro' the Heart before the Temper can be ruffled into a Disposition to repulse it In this Light a  Plain Dealer  is a Father or rather a Friend which is yet dearerA Father may leave us Wealth and Titles from which we may derive Au∣thority or Distinction but such a Friend can teach us to be wise and Wisdom illu∣strates Obscurity and adorns Dignity with an Eminence superior to that of Fortune it vests us too with the noblest  Power  for it enables us to govern our Passions  Alexander  justly preferr'd his Master  Ari∣stotle  to his Father  Philip The King  said he  but made me a Prince the Philosopher made me a Man  I OBSERV'D That your dear  Patty Am∣ble  delighting to  talk much  took little Plea∣sure in giving  Attention  But that Lady urges her  Sex's Privilege  when she declares an Antipathy to  Plain Dealing  Ah cri∣ed the charming  Coquet  how preferable is Flattery to  Plain Dealing  I know that in the common Cant Flattery is said to be  gross  that it is called The  Craft  of the  Courtier  The  Seducer  of  Beauty  and The vain Promiser of a Happiness which it ne∣ver means to bestow But let me tell you they had done it more Justice had they cal∣led it The  Soother  of  Discontent  The  Re∣finer  of  Fancy  The  Imbellishment  of  Con∣versation  The very  Inspirer  of  polite Plea∣sures  What a Delicacy of Delight should we lose were that odious  Plain Deal∣ing  to prevail Mr  Volatile  would no lon∣ger give the  Tattling  of a Lady the com∣plaisant Term of  Liveliness  nor the  Major  soften our Sex's Levities with the pretty Title of  Innocent Amusements  Our Ex∣pence in Dress Equipage Masquerades and  Opera Subscriptions  would lose the agreeable Name of  Taste  for that hideous one of  Extravagance  so that our darling Modes of Thinking which we have so long been told are owing to our Reason and Discernment would then be forc'd to wear a much more mortifying Title and be cal∣led Our downright  Vanity  I WAS willing to take the Advantage of this Pause but could not resist the Pleasure of listening to that everrambling everagreeable Tongue What Lover continu∣ed the inchanting Trifler would not rather be  flatter'd  into Hope then abandon'd to Despair by  Plain Dealing  The Coxcomb delightfully deceives himself by fancying our very  Denials  to be Tokens of our fu∣ture Favours The Man of Sense who when a  Lover  is of Course to be  mistaken  believes the Charmer he admires has a Wit as penetrating as her Eyes and vain of the real Worth he possesses becomes Fool enough in his Turn to think  Merit  a Re∣commendation to the LadiesThus when you flatter  Us  you appear agreeable when we flatter  You  we secure our Con∣quests and when we Both flatter  Ourselves  we consult and preserve our Quiet These are Pleasures which  Plain Dealing  would intirely deface and abolish  BUT Madam cried  Ned Volatile  as

is more  ancient  it must therefore be more  honour∣able  than  Plain Dealing  Plain Dealing  interrupted the  Critick  had been more gracefully drawn in the fa∣vourite Character of Mr  Wicherley  's Come∣dy if his good Qualities remaining equal∣ly strong had been soften'd to appear more  amiable  But his Judgment is mix'd with Partiality and his Wit with Illmanners He's impatient of Contradiction

most open Re∣bellion Had  Tarquin  never trusted the Dissimulation of the First  Brutus  the Ex∣pulsion of his Race had been prevented And I think it may easily be determined by the Unprejudiced how far the admired Last of that Name deviated from his boasted  Honesty  when he conspired against the Man whose Interest he espoused and whose par∣ticular Affection had pardon'd promoted and confided in him when in the Person of that Godlike  Caesar  he assassinated his  Father  his  Friend  and his  Preserver  I HAD now an Opportunity to offer my Sentiments in my Turn and ventur'd to interpose as

SIR Your most humble Servant  R S  The Plain Dealer No  Vilius Argentum est Auro Virtutibus Aurum  HOR  FRIDAY  March    To the  PLAINDEALER  MiddleTemple  March    SIR  I AM a Young Fellow left by my Pa∣rents without any Provision besides that of a good Education nor have I any Prospect of Fortune but what I may by the Assistance of that hope to raise in my Profession You will certainly think I had other Business to mind than being  in Love  and yet Sir that is the Cause of my pre∣sent ApplicationI must own myself not able to withstand the Charms of a cer∣tain Young Lady who is one of your Rea∣ders She is at once Mistress of the greatest  Sense Knowledge Wit  and  Sweetness  of  Temper  Qualities  each  of which by itself possess'd to that eminent Degree she now enjoys them  all  were sufficient to make whomsoever she honours with her Choice  compleatly happy  She has for some Time admitted me to the Favour of visiting her and treats me on all Occasions with the greatest Civility I have heard her often say She thought  the Law  to which by this Time you perceive I belong the most  Genteel  and  Honourable  of all Professions That she never would marry for  Money  And a Hundred such Things that a young Fellow as I am is naturally vain enough to construe into  Encouragements  But Sir she is a great  Fortune  and you know what  Ridicule  a Young Man  without any  meets with who makes Addresses of that Kind and comes off unsuccessfullyI desire therefore you would take an Opportunity in one of your Papers to let her know That if she has any such Thoughts as my Wishes have flattered my Hopes into a  Suspicion  of Her Advances ought to be a great deal  more  than is usually judged reasonable For while I have the least  Doubt  of her Inclinations I had rather die a Thou∣sand  Deaths  than by a mistaken Pre∣sumption run the Hazard of losing what alone can make  Life  valuable to  SIR  Your very Humble Servant  SYLVIO  THE Case of my Correspondent is pretty nice and as this seems to be a Matter of the greatest Importance to both Parties I think I cannot bestow a Paper better than in taking it into Consideration and in giving some Advice that may be of Service to all who are in the same Circumstances  IF we consider the Affair of  Marriage  as it is now generally carried on in the World there are innumerable Difficulties which damp pursuits of that Kind in a Young Fellow who let him deserve ever so well in other Respects wants what the World  alone  esteems  Merit  an ESTATE  SOME of these Difficulties arise from the  Women themselves  There are few among them to be found who have any Notion of Enjoyments beyond mere  sensual  Gratificati∣ons A  Masquerade  affords them infinitely more Pleasure than the brightest Conversa∣tion a  Diamond  has more Charms than any of the moral Virtues and I doubt not there are some who for the Sake of riding in a Coach and Six would Yoke themselves with a  verier Beast  than any in their  own Equipage  Let any one Traffick with them for the dear Delights of  Wealth  they will  buy  even at the  highest Price  That is They will pay the Purchase in what they prize most  Themselves  And tho' hardly any Match on these Considerations alone has ever yet proved happy They still  go onNotwithstanding they are sure to  repent  They never fail to make the  Choice  How wretched is the faithful Youth  Since Womens Hearts were  Bought  and  Sold  They ask not Vows of sacred  Truth  Whene'er they s  gh they s  gh for  Gold  OTHER Women there are indeed whose Minds of a less mercenary Cast consider only the  Merit  of their Admirers who are capable of receiving that Love which flows from  Esteem  and of tasting Happiness from  rational Enjoyments  But how few of these enjoy the Liberty of  choosing for themselves  How many groan under the Tyranny of an Avaritious Parent who would no more part with his Daughter than his Land to any but the  best Purchaser  How would he  Scoff  at a Young Man's Impudence who instead of paying  Her Price  should pretend to talk of Her  Happiness  FROM thus much of the Sex then  Money∣less Merit  seems intirely excluded The Woman who has  Liberty  as well as  Capacity  to make a prudent Choice is the only one with whom we can hope Success And here arise new Difficulties from another Side The  Men  are  now  our Hindrance and one in my Correspondent's Circumstances must ex∣pect  himself  to suffer for the general ill Cha∣racter of his  Sex  Men daily shew them∣selves  as little  disinterested  in their Pursuits as Women  Age Folly  and  IllNature  are no Impediments to them provided there be but  Money  Love and Esteem are so frequently used as Pretences while the real Affection is only for the Fortune that Women are alarm'd at the first Approach and a Young Fellow dares hardly Love where Prudence only permits him to Love without incurring the odious Title of a  For∣tunehunter  IF therefore my Correspondent sincerely feels within himself that disinterested Affe∣ction which he seems to act by I would advise him to take all possible Methods to  convince  the Lady of it I need not direct him  how  for if he is sincere his Passion will discover it self in every Word and Action But by no means let him be  hasty  in his AddressesWith a Lady of her Sense his  Modesty  will add much to his  Influence  True Love springs not upon a sudden and should he urge his Wishes too far before her  Inclination  has improv'd itself into  Affection  she might ra∣tionally construe his Forwardness to proceed from other Motives than the genuine Effects of his personal and disinterested Admira∣tion  ON the other Side I must take upon me to remind the Young Lady that  Time  is more in haste than  she  is and I would ad∣vise her if she is as I presume at her own Disposal and if she is satisfied of the  Merit  as well as the Affection of our Young Law∣yer as one of the Sense he ascribes to her may soon be not to  demur  upon his Want of  Fortune  Happiness in Marriage does not depend on Suitableness of  Estates  but of  Tempers  If there be but a Competency on  one  Side no matter on which it lies  Love  indeed should be  reciprocal  but there is no Necessity that  Fortune  should There is  This more  to be considered That besides the Happiness of an agreeable Partner for Life which she will enjoy in  common  with  him  she will have the Addition of a  superior  Satisfa∣ction in the noble and everpleasing Refle∣ction That she has intitled herself as well to his  Gratitude  as his  Love  by exalting a Man of  Worth  into  Eminence  and  Prosperity  who otherwise for  want  only of That which  she abounded in  might have had his Genius depress'd and been  lost in Obscurity  To the  PLAIN DEALER  Button  's  CoventGarden  March    SIR  THIS Place which  once  was the ce∣lebrated  Seat  of  Wit  is now deser∣ted by all that Sort of Company and transformed into an  Old Bailey  in  Minia∣ture  The  Classics  are elbowed out by the  Constables  and instead of  Poems  or  Essays  nothing is heard of here but  Warrants  and  Commitments  Most of the  good  Com∣pany  is frighten'd away to make Room for the  grave  and those who  dare stay  croudle about the Fire when a  Magistrate  enters with as much Terror as if they saw a  Ghost  I beg you would  deal  a little  plainly  with these Men of  Authority  and advise them to reflect on the  Illegality  of putting His Ma∣jesty's peaceful Subjects into  bodily Dread  if not on the  Highway  yet in Places de∣sign'd to be as  Publick  For they strut about the Room and shoot out their  Mittimus  's like  Porcupine  's  Quills  so that unless among other  Poetical Licences  Wit can plead an  Exemption from their Cognizance  they are unfit for the  Gay World's  Society and ought to live by themselves And you may assure them if they provoke us much more we will bring the dead  Lyon  to Life again and doubt not but with a few Days good Feeding he will be able to treat  Masqueraders  who flant it in his Skin as an Ancestor of his did their Predecessor in  Aesop  I am SIR Your Humble Servant  TIMORET  I find among the Letters which came to my Hand in the last Packet one Epistle of so extraordinary a Kind that to confess a plain Truth it exceeds my Capacity to judge  rightly concerning itI am not a Stran∣ger to the  Tradition  which carries so much Weight with the  Seafaring  Part of His Ma∣jesty's  LiegePeople  that the  Apes  and  Mon∣kies  of  Africa  can  speak  like  Men  when they have a Mind to itYet I am natu∣rally not over credulous But since I am told there are among the  Directors  of the  Guinea Company  PROOFS to be met with which make the Truth of it  unquestionable  I am almost perswaded to give myself up to the  Belief  of a Thing which seems indeed to be very clearly made out by my  underwritten Correspondent  Worthy SIR  I AM a Native of the  Western Africa  a Subject of the King of  Tombuto  By  Species  I am no more than a  Monkey  but I am in a fair Way to be made a  Man  For a fine young Lady of a great Fortune is fallen desperately in Love with me and prefers me in the most open Manner before all her  other  AdmirersBut in the midst of this unhop'd Felicity comes a Feathery Fool called a  Parrot  to a House that is just over against us and has  tattled  himself into such  Eminence  that they talk of a Project on Foot to remove him very shortly into a HOUSE of much more Di∣stinction  THE Competition I have observed among your  great Men  or Persons of  Quality  who shall  bid most  for this  empty Prater  has  provoked me to  discover a Talent  which is  conceal'd  with all possible  Caution  by the Laws of our  mimick Species  In short I am forced to  cry out Shame  on these Peo∣ple's  unreasonable Partiality  If my Fop of a Rival was  nearer a Kin  to them than I am I should not wonder at their Preference But since  Nature  has given it on  my Side  and  my Shape my Air my Counte∣nance  and in particular my  Parts  and  Disposition  all concur to demonstrate my  Affinity  to these unjust Judges while  Poll  with all his Impertinence can pretend to no other  Resemblance  than what lies in his  fine Cloaths  and  everlasting Pratling  with∣out knowing a Word of his own Meaning these Things I say duly considered you will not I hope impute to  Envy  what arises merely from a  modest Consciousness of my own Virtues  But exert yourself in the Behalf of  overlooked  if not  oppress'd  Merit I am  Worthy SIR  Your most Obedient Servant  PUGG  PS  MY  Mistress  takes in your Paper and likes you mightilyShe had just called for a Pen and Ink to write you a Letter about the last  Opera  when a Lady came and took her out and has left me this Opportunity of sending my  Case  to the PLAIN DEALER  The Plain Dealer N  o    Falsis terroribus implet  HOR  MONDAY  March    AMONG many Letters I have lately received the Two following will fur∣nish my Readers with no disagreeable En∣tainment  To the  PLAINDEALER  SIR  I AM seldom negligent in my Atten∣dance at the CoffeeHouse upon those Days when you favour the World with your LecturesYou very prudently entertain us with a great deal of  Variety  Which is doubtless the most ready and in∣fallible Means of  Improvement  For if you altogether treated about Religious or Mo∣ral Duties you would be disregarded by your  gay  Readers and relish'd only by your  Rational  But as we are ignorant of what you will discourse 'till we take up your Papers we may out of Curiosity be una∣wares catched by an  Admonition  in  Mas∣querade  under the Disguise of a mere Amusement  YOU have indulged no obscene or im∣moral Reflections But have on the con∣trary discountenanced  Vice  and supported Religion with Vivacity and Frankness of Spirit consequently the  Inconsiderate  may by Degrees be awakened into an Exertion of the  Thinking Faculty  by which chiefly we are distinguished and support our boast∣ed Superiority over the  brutal  Creation A virtuous Reader of your Paper can at worst but be render'd  chearful  without Violation of his  Innocence  And your Writings being generally  pleasing  and very often  useful  I flatter my self That Men are not so aban∣doned to Ignorance as we are ready to ima∣gine since they give such a kind Accepta∣tion to you Essays which have no mean or ungenerous Gratifications to recommend them  I LEARN from your  Plain Dealing  to be inoffensive in Conversation I observe all that passes wherever I happen to be and endeavour at the same Time to  contract  or  extend  my self till I am grown  fit  for my Company Though by the Way we should resolutely preserve this most reason∣able  Steadiness on no Account whatever to  humour a Friend at the Expence of our Health our Reputation or our Virtue  FRIEND did I say I retract the AppellationFor certainly if we think right that Person who solicites us to Actions inconsistent with Rea∣son with Honour or with Decency is un∣deserving of so sublime a CharacterBut this single Exception allow'd for we should condescend to appear blind to the Weak∣nesses of those we converse withAnd he who acts otherwise will justly incur the Censure of an odious and scornful Auste∣rityA Man's  first  Care should be to avoid the Reproaches of his own Heart and his  second  to escape the ill Wishes of other People  WE learn with Delight from such  Plain Dealing  as yours That a wise Man's Busi∣ness is to subdue the Roughness of Passion into the Calmness of a tranquil Humility And that the more his Knowledge is en∣larg'd the more he will perceive  wanting  to be search'd after  Tully  tells us The Mind of a wise Man never  swells  nor be∣comes  elated  For my own Part I fancied my self when I was young to be acquaint with every Thing But now I can perceive my Learning contracted with a narrow Cir∣cle and almost obscured in a  dark Point  when compared with that infinite and in∣exhaustible Number of Subjects to which I am an utter Stranger In a Word I am convinced That an illgrounded Conceit∣edness  of our own Abilities is the most con∣temptible Weakness of Nature And even where it may seem justified by our real Merit it renders odious and supportable the very  Virtue  which Occasions it  BUT to make a Transition from what  I learn from  you to an Information I intend to  give you  There is a pretty Maxim in the  Guardian  to  think  with the  Wise  but  talk  with the  Vulgar  Which occurr'd strongly to my Memory upon observing with what Pleasure your late  Cambridge  Letter con∣cerning some little feminine Exravagancies was received in all PlacesGive me Leave therefore to entertain you with a strange and fearful Discovery which it was lately my Fortune to make upon passing a Night or Two in a Country VillageIt was in a Ramble last Harvest I had the Honour to wait on a  Widow  as well  stor'd  as the  Fields  were in a kind of  Progress  to visit her Tenants  AFTER Dinner one Day I left the good Company with their honest Entertainers the Farmer and his narrative Family to accompany the  Inhabitants  of the  Yard  and enjoy the silent Serenity of a very beau∣tiful Prospect which was bounded by the Shade of Trees and Hills with ruin'd Buildings at a little Distance from the Cot∣tageI was envying the Happiness and Quiet of these unbusy People and had wander'd as it were insensibly over half a  Dozen Stiles into the Remoteness of a hollow sandy way Where I stood with great Delight to observe the Fall of a pret∣ty  Rill  which gushing out from among the Rushes above roll'd down the sandy Bank and shap'd it self a Passage along the Bot∣tom of the Road I walk'd in The Gloomi∣ness that was spread all round had fitted this Place above all I had ever seen for the Abode of fantastick Melancholly And whilst I was busied in Thoughts of this Nature I saw a Country Woman ha∣sten towards me who wav'd her Hand as she came forward and cried out to me to  walk onFor I was standing at Gooddy  Hubbard  's watering Place    AS soon as the good Woman came near enough to be ask'd  What she meant  I found that Gooddy  Hubbard  was a  Witch  that lived in the Wood And that if any  Cow Horse  or other Cattle staid long enough in that Place to drink of its  enchanted Water  All the Hay they should eat from that Time forward would be turned into  crooked Pins  and the poor Beasts must certainly  die after it  I begged she would go along with me to shew me the Witch's House To which Proposition she replied with inexpressible Consternati∣on  She would not for the World be so pre∣sumptuous  She added That it was about half a Mile off and shook her Head and assured me that the whole Village trem∣bled  at the Sight of this  Goody Hubbard  That for her own Part very lately as she was Gleaning in a Field by the Wood's Side the Witch had appeared to her out of the Hedge in the Shape of the Leaf of a Tree And ran along before her and play'd Gambols over and over in her Path all the Way as she came home againI ask'd her Whether she had found any ill Consequence after so terrible an Accident And she answer'd with great Innocence and Gravity That she had but too much Reason to believe she was  bewitched  ha∣ving many  strange  and  wicked Thoughts  run∣ning ever Day in her Head about Things she had never been troubled with till that unfortunate Leaf fell in her way since she was a  Maid  or but little better  I COULD not resist the Temptation which these silly Stories left me under of making a  Visit  to the formidable  Gooddy Hubbard  whom I found in a little Hovel which the Charity of the Lord of the Manor had or∣dered to be built for her in the Wood be∣cause the honest People of the Village ha∣ving taken it into their Heads to make a  Witch  of the poor old Woman fell upon her as often as she came in their Way And had two or three times endangered her Life by scratching her with their Nails till every Body had  fetch'd Blood  of her as the Phrase is after which it seems no  Witch  in  Eng∣land  has Power to hurt a Hair of any Person's Head who takes this effectual Way to  disarm  her  I CAME off with no other Damage than the Loss of all the Money I had in my Pocket which the Influence of downright Compassion compelled me to leave behind for the Comfort of an afflicted Creature whose unsupported Age and Wretched∣ness instead of the  Relief  or  Pity  which was due to them by  Nature  had procur'd her the malicious Rage and Persecution of  unthinking Ignorance  I return'd to my  Widow  and after a long and plesant Con∣versation on the Subject of  Witchcraft  agreed heartily with her That there were  such Things as Witches  and took upon me to assure with a  Sigh  and a  downcast Eye  That I had  my self  suffer'd so severely by one of them that I never expected to become my  own Man  again though I should live to the Age of a  Patriarch    I am Mr  PLAINDEALER  Your very humble Servant  PHILOTHEUS  To the  PLAIN DEALER  SIR  CASTING my Eye upon  Horace  I found this excellent Piece of Advice  Leges Perscrutabere Doctos  As I gene∣rally put in Practice what I read in Pursu∣ance to his Advice I sent for a Set of your Papers and am now carefully perusing  them I take the same Method that Law∣yers generally do with their  Reports  read the Modern Cases first so go upward till they come to the FountainHead But when I light upon some of your  Female  Cor∣respondents it puts me in Mind of the  Ro∣man  Ladies of old they resemble them so much in  Spirit  and  Passion  that I verily believe many of their  Great Great Grand∣mothers  lye buried in the  Campus Martius  or the  Capitol  'Tis not incredible That af∣ter  Caesar  had first enter'd  Britain  some of their  Legionary Ladies  upon the Fame of the  Britons  unwearied Courage might make a second  Roman Invasion  and  with as good Success as  Caesar after  he  had opened a Passage for them  LIVY  some where tells us That when the old Gentlemen of  Rome  were contri∣ving a Scheme to have more of their La∣dies good Company at home the  Women rose up in Arms  to the great Surprize of the  Roman  State That they denied the  Senators  a free Passage to the House And that  Cato  by Name had like to have been  carried off  by the  Mob  They claimed as their ancient  Rights  and undoubted  Pri∣vileges  almost as strange Things as your  Mistress  does in her late Scheme for esta∣blishing a  Female Parliament  However upon a  Parly  between both Parties the  Women  submitted the Case to the  Senate  Where they always carried the  Majority  though 'tis well known no Lady sate in  House  Nor was that at all surprizing For if we examine History I believe we shall find the  Senate  at that Time con∣sisted more of  Wits  than of  Wise Men  over whom for the sake of  Politeness  the  Women  must have most Influence nor is it less probable that their being in Arms might  frighten  the  old  Gentlemen  THE Use of  Bribery  likewise had then newly been found out and I dare say there was no Lady who had not about her  wherewithal  to  purchase a Vote  Such was the Courage of the  Roman  Ladies of old And how exactly our  Moderns  imitate them is I believe too plain to need de∣scribing Happy therefore it is and much for the  Peace of Great Britain  that our Parliament has never attempted the Mo∣deration of their exorbitant  Hoops  or the Abridgement of their  PinMoney  For my Part I must frankly confess I have no Ob∣jection to make against Mrs  Patty Amble  's Proposal Other Men may have their  Fears  from the supposed  Consequences  of a  Female Parliament  But I think they are  out  in their  Politicks  If a Power grows always  weaker  the more it is  divided  Let  me  be a  Republican  in  Love  and chuse rather to pay Obebience to  Five Hundred  of these pretty COMMONS that live a  Slave  to  One Sole  TYRANT and neither  enjoy  nor dare  talk  of my  Liberty  Alas Sir This is exactly the present Case of  Your Humble Servant  POLITICUS  The Plain Dealer N  o    Quid deceat quid non quo Virtus quo ferat Error  HOR  FRIDAY  March    I FELL lately into Company with a Class of young Poets who affect to be Admir∣ers of  Tasso  and were Extravagant in their Praise of a  Simile  in his  Gierusalemme  where the  Devil  maligning the Success of the  Chri∣stian  Arms is said To  bite his Lips and spurn up the Floor of Hell in bellowing Rage like a wild Bull when the Dogs are baiting him  THEY made me promise That I would give them my impartial Opinion and be∣cause they earnestly press to know it I will borrow the Reflections of a Friend on the Subject of  Similes in general  which contain whatever I would say were I to speak con∣cerning the Nature of this great Ornament to Poetry than which there is nothing more capable of being made either  delightful  or  ridiculous  according as it is used discreetly or at random  THE Use which a Poet ought to make of  Comparisons  is to  illustrate  the Object re∣presented that is to enlighten and enlarge the Apprehension of the Reader The Na∣ture therefore of the Thing which is  com∣pared  must correspond exactly with what it is  compared to  There must not only be an ap∣parent  Resemblance  but a visible  Proportion  A Thing  low  and  inconsiderable  may be  like  enough to something  great  and  magnificent  but then wanting Dignity to appear in its Company no Poet of Judgment should sub∣mit to make Use of itI will give the Reader an Instance of a very remarkable Fault of this KindSir  Richard Black∣more  in his  Prince Arthur  has been pleased to compare the Devil looking down from a Mountain on the  British  Camp to a  Toad  on the Border of a Walk looking up at the Gardener  While with malignant Eyes th' Apostate view'd  Their Host with  Octa  's Message pleas'd he stood  Stung deep with Malice and with Envy torn  While all his  Veins  like  Aetna  's Furnace burn  THE  Veins  of the Devil I suppose were not so much owing to Sir  Richard  's Forget∣fulness that he was describing a  Spirit  as to a politick Design of reducing  Satan  to downright  Flesh  and  Blood  that the Reader conceiving a more humble Opinion of him than he had been taught in his In∣fancy  might be the better prepar'd for the  Toad  in the Comparison  And Streams of Fire from his red Eyeballs flow'd  Like Light'ning breaking from a low'ring Cloud  As when a  Toad  squat on a Border spies  The Gard'ner passing by his Bloodshot Eyes  With Spite and Rage inflam'd dart Fire around  The verdant Walks and on the flow'ry Ground  The bloated Vermin loathsome Poison spits  And swoln and bursting with his Hatred sits  So  the  fall'n Angel  c  FALLEN  indeed if no abler to do Harm to Sir  Richard  's Hero than his  Toad  to the Gardener Where is the terrible  Power  the wily restless  Malice  the insatiate revengeful  Application  of this dangerous Enemy to Mankind in Sir  Richard  's  humble Simile  A  Toad  may be  poisonous  but then he may be  trod upon  which is by no Means the Case of the  Devil  If a Poet who introdu∣ces  Satan  thus  inraged  would imagine a Comparison to aggrandize the Horror of his Reader's Conception it must certainly arise from nothing which we are to look  down  upon no little venomous inconsiderable Creature The Elements should War toge∣ther on such Occasions as these the Skies should blaze with Lightning the World reel with Earthquakes the Sea rise to Hea∣ven the Poles crack with Thunder and  all  Nature  groan with Variety of Convul∣sions  Toad Poison Squat Bloated Spits Vermin Loathsome Swoln Bursting  What Image can arise from such Expressions as these which is either  like  or  agreeable  TO say Truth no  Simile  at all should have been introduced in the Place I have been complaining against The natural Concep∣tion of a Reader can represent to his  Fancy  the Idea of the Devil looking angry from a Mountain much better than any common Image of Things known can represent it to his  Memory  A Comparison is never to be made but where the Object to be described is less known or less conceivable than some∣thing else which being of equal Grandeur and Importance will also illustrate and rivet it on the Understanding  THE Descriptions and Similes which we meet with in  Milton  give us quite other Ideas of this dreadful RebelAngel  Scarce had he ceas'd when the superior Fiend  Was moving tow'rd the Shore his pondrous Shield  Behind him cast the broad Circumference  Hung on his Shoulders like the  Moon  c  His Spear to equal which the tallest Pine  Hewn on  Norwegian  Hills to be the Mast  Of some great Admiral were but a  Wand  He walk'd with to support uneasy Steps  Over the burning Marl  Again  Forth came in Order the infernal Peers  'Midst them their  mighty Paramount  who seem'd  Alone  th' Antagonist of Heaven nor  less  Than Hell's dread Emperor with Pomp supreme  And Godlike imitated State Him round  A Globe of fiery  Seraphim  inclosed  And again    Satan  above the Rest  In Shape and Gesture proudly  eminent  Stood like a  Tower  nor yet his Form appear'd  Less  than  ArchAngel ruin'd  and th' Excess  Of Glory obscur'd As when the  Sun  newris'n  Shorn of his Beams looks thro' the misty Air  Deep Scars of Thunder had  intrenc'd  his Face  Care  on his faded Cheeks sat under Brows  Of dauntless Courage and considerate Pride  HAVING named Mr  Milton  I am well enough aware That Sir  Richard  may endea∣vour a Justification from  that  great Poet's Example who has made Use in another Place of this very Simile of a  Toad  when  he also  is describing  Satan  but pray ob∣serve with what Difference as well in the Occasion as the Conduct  SATAN  after having changed himself into many different Shapes to avoid a Disco∣very by those Angelick Guards which were  plac'd about Paradise is met with at last by one of the Parties  So saying on he led his radiant Files  Dazling the Moon These to the Bower direct  In Search of whom they sought Him there they found  Squat  like a  Toad  close at the  Ear  of  Eve  BESIDES his Necessity of providing against  Discovery  of which he was in no Danger in Sir  Richard  's Poem he takes the Shape of a  Toad  as most proper while  Eve  was asleep to approach her closely concealed among the Flowers and sweet Herbs on which she lay  Assaying by his Devilish Art to reach  The Organs of her Fancy  there to forge  Illusions as he lists  OBSERVE here that the Devil is in no  Rage  when thus compared but on the contrary under much  Terror  and endeavour∣ing to  deceive  and  circumvent  and therefore obliged in Policy to assume that Form which was rather suitable to his  End  than answerable to his  Power  But when he appears in his  proper Likeness  the very Angels are represented as terrified and start∣ing back with Amazement  Him thus intent  Ithuriel  with his Spear  Touch'd lightly for no Falsehood can endure  Touch of Celestial Temper but returns  Perforce to its own LikenessUp he starts  Discover'd and surpriz'd As when a Spark  Lights on a  nitrous Heap  the smutty Grain  With sudden Blaze diffus'd  inflames  the  Air  So started up in his own Shape the  Fiend  Back stept the Two fair Angels half amaz'd  So sudden to  behold  the  grisly King  NOTHING of this is  little  nothing  dimi∣nishing  The whole is natural terrible ma∣jestick surprizing and becoming the Dignity of the Subject it relates to  A  Simile  should if possible be  alike  in all its Parts It is enough that some  one  Quality of the Comparison resemble some  one  Part or Nature of the Object it is compared to  Homer  has been infinitely guilty of this Error hurried as it were away with the Ra∣pidity of his Imagination he seldom staid to weigh any more of a Simile than that very Part of it which suited his Purpose not mindful enough that upon starting an Ob∣ject to which many Qualities are common the Apprehension of the Reader is not per∣haps at Leisure to examine which  particular  Quality includes the  Resemblance  and there∣fore discerns not any Likeness at all but with such Trouble and Application as totally destroy the very End of a  Simile  For if the  Design of this Ornament be to  illustrate  a  De∣scription  it ought not certainly to be found  obscure  in  itself  THERE is in the noble  Greek  Poet above∣mentioned a famous Comparison of  Ajax  who retreats slow from an overpowering Crowd of  Trojans  to an  Ass  in an  Enclosure  surrounded and beaten by the Sticks of the Village but walking gravely notwithstan∣ding toward the Gap he came in at and stopping very frequently to  eat  in his Way Monsieur  Dacier Bossu  and all the  French  Criticks who are not Converts to Monsieur  Perault  's Observations have taken a great deal of Pains to justify this Simile of  Homer  's But in my Opinion they are all mistaken not only in the  Defence  but in the very  Ac∣cusation  It is not so much the  Ass  that de∣serves Blame since he was in those Days a  Beast  of Great  Quality  It is rather that the Resem∣blance is  partial  where it ought to have been  total  The  stiff reluctant Receding  of  Ajax  from his Enemies is certainly well hit in the Ob∣stinacy of the  Ass  but where is that Part of the Comparison which should enliven to our Imaginations his frequent Return to Slaugh∣ter His Impatience of Soul That Fierce∣ness Indignation and revengeful Intrepidity which the Poet's  Description  had also prepa∣red us to expect in his  Simile  The  Ass  with∣out doubt was  loth to depart  as  Ajax  but he was neither so apt to be  angry  nor so dangerous if he became so  COMPARISONS to conclude this Reflection can never be proper in  Passions  or violent Emotions of Mind The Imagination is then too much transported and inflamed to cast about for  cool Resemblances  But in the Mouth of the Poet that is to say in the Course of the  Narration  and not in the  Speeches  they are beautiful and necessary They  describe  Passion well though they do not  express  it And to say all in a Word Where  Descrip∣tion alone  appears too weak to imprint an Idea on the Mind of a Reader there the only effectual Remedy is to have Recourse to a  Simile  The Plain Dealer N  o    Est mollis flamma medullas  Interea tacitum vivit sub pectore Vulnus  VIRG  MONDAY  March    SINCE  Love  which in both Sexes is the most irresistable of our Passions has its strongest Influence on  Woman  I cou'd ne∣ver observe That Cruelty and malicious Sa∣vageness of  Jealousy  which actuates the  La∣dies  against those whom they consider as  their  Rivals  without inwardly lamenting the Weakness of their Minds who had rather be  lovely  than  happy  and while they tor∣ment their pretty Hearts with a Thousand  Alarms  and  Suspicions  never take it into their Heads to  discover  That they hate the Object of their Resentment for only  think∣ing  and  loving as They do  and that what they are  pursuing  with  Revenge  ought ra∣ther to be  met  with  Compassion  BUT the Honour of the Sex's  Reason Ge∣nerosity  and  Moderation  seems to be re∣deem'd in this Particular by the noble Spi∣rits of Two Ladies from One of which I have had the Pleasure to receive a Letter so intirely  new  and writ with so much  natural  Force and Sweetness that it is impossible the Reader shou'd not feel the same Effect from it that I didI suppress for the sake of  Modesty  and not without some Re∣luctance and Mortification to my  Vanity  an introductory Paragraph fill'd with the most obliging and gentile Praises of the PLAIN DEALER and hasten at once into the Sub∣ject of the Letter  I AM led observes this charming Cor∣respondent to imagine  Friendship  the Favourite Passion of your Soul because your Sentiments seem finely turn'd for it  Mine  too as far as its inferior Faculties permit is truly sensible of and devoted to itBut I never felt it so forcibly as I  did the other Day in a Visit which I made to a young Lady a dear and intimate Friend in the Country  SHE retir'd from me not long since to indulge a silent Grief which I and every Body had taken Notice of but which she had endeavour'd to conceal from her Ac∣quaintance with a Care as earnest as it was vain For her Eyes and alter'd Com∣plexion made it evident to all who loved her and therefore delighted to look on her that there was something at her Heart too melancholy for  Solitude  and yet too  engag'd  for  Society  THE Privilege of our Intimacy intro∣duced me to her Chamber without No∣tice or Ceremony where I found her writing and  alone  The Subject which her Thoughts were fill'd with had fixed her in so profound an Attention that it gave me Freedom and Opportunity to stand a while and observe the beautiful Distress of her Mind which was  lost  and labour'd in a  meaning Sadness  and preven∣ted her from seeing or supposing that there was any Body so near her  NEVER was  Sorrow  so Majestical so sweetly  Noble  Her lively Features were soften'd into a  Languishment  that was love∣lier than  Health  and more charming than  Transport  Her  Eyes  seem'd to have  conspir'd  against the Purpose of her  Hands  For they stream'd down  Tears  upon the  Paper as if they would  efface  the mourn∣ful Words as fast as she had written them And now and then a  Sigh  such as  Love alone  inspires swell'd her conscious and distracted Bosom  AT last she saw  me  and  trembled  She rose in Confusion and came forward to embrace me which while she was do∣ing she press'd into my Bosom the Paper she had been writing And with a vio∣lent  Burst  of Tears breaking suddenly from my Neck flew down a Pair of BackStairs into the Garden and left me Speech∣less with Astonishment  I FOUND the Paper address'd to  me  And I leave you to imagine whether my  Surprize  was at all abated when I perus'd in it the following Discovery of the un∣guess'd  Cause  of my dear Friend's  Retire∣ment  OH my everlov'dmy faithful Friendmy Heart is flowing to you with  such  Shame and  confessing Pe∣nitence  as they who are serene enough to enjoy the Comforts of  Devotion  address allpitying  Heaven  withMy Misery is so truly great that nothing but the  Sin  of having  conceal'd a Thought from you  cou'd have given it the least  Addition  BUT let me hasten to  impart  to you the only Grief I cou'd have had a Reason for  hiding  from youI  love  Oh how  shall my Confusion preserve Strength to go on while I addThat it is  Your Hus∣band  Let His  Perfection  plead for me if you  start  at this DeclarationAnd oh  confess  what you have experienc'd so undeniably  That none cou'd have seen him as I have without being as guilty as I am  I WAS dull enough to imagine That  Friendship  having possess'd my Heart wou'd have  guarded  it against  Love  But oh  That  Thought has  lost  me  IT was the fatal Happiness of being  near you  that discover'd to me the Beauties of his MindHis respectful Tenderness for  You  His impartial and distinguishing Affection for his  Children  His Contempt of the  Proud  and  Ignoble  And his Com∣passion for the  Friendless  and  Unhappy  Oh how fatally is He accomplish'dand how  deserving  your Affection  CONCEAL from him oh my Friend the Knowledge that He has made me  wretched  For  yet  my Eyes and my Actions have been so watchfully  guarded  that  He  is as much a Stranger to it as all the World but  Yourself  from whom to have  conceal'd  it appear'd to me as  Crimi∣nal  as  not  to have conceal'd it from your Husband  THIS only  dreadful  Cause shou'd have torn me from your lov'd SocietySuffer me  here  to bury myself in the  Innocence  of  Solitude  till Absence or Death shall  have put an End to the Tyranny with which  Love  has triumph'd over me  I KNOW you are too generous to ex∣pect on this sad Occasion any dull or mean  Excuses  Where the  Will  is not guilty the  Misfortune  is sufficient  Atone∣ment  But tho' you have no Pretence for  Pardoning  I flatter myself you will  weep for  me and in Pity now and then  see  your ever faithful unhappy Friend  c  I leave Her noble Letter and the In∣fluence it had on my Soul to your beau∣tiful Imagination Mr PLAIN DEALER who may convert it to the  Use  and

Envy  of my Readers and I am afraid He is  mine  alreadyWhen I hear of such  Women  as  These  I own I wish my self  Young  againThere is a justifiable De∣light in the Admiration of  Beauty  thus

March    THE CZAR of  RUSSIA  is  dead  I tell it not as  News  but I speak it with  Astonishment  The  greatest Spirit  that ever glorified and exalted humane  Nature has stept out of  Time  into  Eternity  And yet the  World  looks still the  same  The Sun shines not  paler  The Season advances and blooms out with its usual  Regularity  And every Thing above and below wears the very Face which it was  us'd  to wear be∣fore the  Death  of This almost  adorable  Mo∣narch seem'd to call for a Night of univer∣sal  Sadness  upon the Lustre of  Created  Glory  ALAS how inconsiderable a Wretch  am I then  What imports it how a  Million  of  us common Thinkers live  or where or when we  die  Since this  Godlike Establisher and Adorner of Empire  can have  left  Nature as  unconcern'd  for him as he  found  her And the  World  which seem'd to tremble under the Weight of his  living  Pressure bears no  Chan∣ges  in her Form or Motion to distinguish such a  Death  as  His  was  WHAT a mortifying  Check  upon the Ex∣travagance of humane  Ambition  is the  Short∣ness  of that  Life  which must give  Limits  to our noblest PurposesWe are sure to  ex∣pire  by the natural Course of our Days be∣fore the  Event  of any  vast  Undertaking can have taught us  to what End we labour'd  While we mediate the  Superstructure  we  sink  and  die  upon the  Foundation  And leave Posterity the License of  supposing examining  and  deciding upon  our Schemes and Actions with a Latitude which could it be fore∣known would curb the Sallies of great Minds  and teach  Heroick Virtue  to be  asham'd  of a Reward so  precarious  as  Fame  and so de∣pendant on the Disposition of Souls too  nar∣row  to take in  Purposes  where  Events  are left imperfect  HOW infinite had been the Progress of this prodigious Prince's Glory could He have looked forward on such a  Length  of  Life  as was allotted to the Ancient  Patriarchs  But in  this  as in  all  Objects of Reflection it is easy for us to trace the  Wisdom  of  Al∣mighty Power  that proportions  Blessings  to  Necessities  And neither grants nor with∣holds in  vain  but adapts whatever  is  to that which  ough to be  In the early Ages of the World when  Arts  and  Qualities  were yet unknown there was a visible Necessity that Men should  live  those many Hundred Years which now we think of with Amaze∣ment because their  Ignorance  requir'd a fre∣quent  Return  of  Observation  and  Connexions  of  reiterated Experience  to establish even the  Rudiments  of all that Variety of Knowledge which served their  Posterity  as  Scaffolding  to stand upon and so by lifting them at once the whole  Height  which  themselves  had climb'd to made their  Business in Life  so much  less  that Life requir'd to be proportionably  shorter  BUT be this as it will the most sparkling Ornament of  Mortality  is now become  im∣mortal  The Soul of PETER the GREAT perhaps associates and compares itself with  Those of CAESAR and of ALEXANDERThere is  Scope enough  upon the Shoreless Ocean of  Eternity  for all its Sails to spread themselves and make new Way for Ever into  Knowledge  and  Discovery  This Earth however large a Part of it He honoured with His Influence  restrain'd imprison'd  and  held short  his GeniusHe seem'd to strug∣gle like a  close cag'd Eagle  for Enlargement more proportioned to the  Vastness  of his  Qua∣lities  He was  truly  GOD's VICEGERENT and irradiated the  Human  Nature with such lively Beamings of the  Divine  that as  He obey'd He resembled  the DeityHe could not indeed  create  Men But he  newmould∣ed  and  inspir'd  them  DETACH'D and  single Attributes  of Virtues which  met  full and perfect in the  Russian Monarch's  Character have eterniz'd the Me∣mory of  Ancient Heroes  and swell'd History with their PraisesThe Invention of  New Arts  The Establishment of  New Laws  The Adornment or Enrichment of their Coun∣try The reducing  Barbarism  into civiliz'd Society The Encouragement of Learning The Punishment of Oppression The Deli∣verance of their own Country or The Con∣quest of othersEach of these  seperately  has been thought sufficient in all Ages to  make  and  immortalize  a HEROWhat  Name  then shall the grateful World invent and bestow to distinguish the  Possessor  of  more  than  all  these Virtues  united  LET us consider him distinctly and impar∣tially in the varied Lights of His  Patience  His  Application  His  Wisdom  His  Justice  His  Generosity  His aspiring  Magnanimity  and the intrepid Firmness of His invincible  Resoluti∣on  In every one of these Views we shall see him  equal  with the noblest Spirits of An∣tiquity And in  some  of them  superior  to all who have been call'd  Great  before him  WHAT he has  done  can either  never  be  equall'd  or equall'd only by what he has  suf∣fer'd  To look back upon the  Beginning  of a Life of continued  Wonders  What Dan∣gers Reproaches Rebellions and Ingrati∣tude did He not meet with  at home  And  abroad  what  Insults Contempt  and  Mortify∣cation  Yet such was the stedfast Patience and Moderation of his Nature that instead of being inflam'd by His  Pride  into rash and sudden Resentment He was only stimulated by His  Reason  into a generous Determinati∣on to make himself too  dreadful  for  Scorn  and become the  Protector  of His  Despisers  That arrogant  Contempt  which was shewn by the late King of  Sweden  's Permission to the  Czar  when he pass'd by  Riga  in the Beginning of his  meaning Travels  let it be weigh'd against the Godlike  Forgiveness Ge∣nerosity  and noble  Compassion  with which this very  Czar  interpos'd afterwards and even to the Check of his own Victories prevented the impending Ruin of that King of  Sweden  's Hostile CountryLet One of these Consi∣derations  I say be weigh'd against the other and then point out any Example from Hi∣story of so  amiable a Greatness  so  sincere  and  sweet  a  Magnanimity  LET His  Application  be measured by the Success of His unwearied LaboursThey who look into  Russia  as it now  is  and re∣member what it  was  within  Twenty  Years past will scarce believe themseves free from the Influence of some  Enchantment  when they see Cities of  Sixty thousand Houses  cover∣ing the Shoar where so lately a few Fish∣ermen dried their NetsWhen they be∣hold a  Sea  filled with  His Ships of War  whom they can remember when He was not Ma∣ster of  One single Harbour  When they see  Nature  reduc'd by  Art  to yield Occasions she was most  repugnant  toDistant Seas taught to  incorporate  Mountains forc'd to give Way to  Rivers  New Engines and Arts of War as well offensive as defensiveNew Customs New Trades New  Souls  And a Face of universal Knowledge and Politeness smiling in all Parts of a Land which was so lately overrun with the darkest Ignorance and BarbarityAnd when they shall be told That all these astonish∣ing Changes are the mere Effects of  One  Man's prodigious and unbounded Mind what less can they say in  Answer  than That  such a Man  had been a  God  could His  Body  have been rendered but as  immortal  as His  Fame  is  WAS there an  Oppressor  in  Europe  whom His Resolution did not mortify or an  injur'd  or  afflicted Prince  whom His Generosity did not  pity  The Wings of His aspiring  Eagle  shadow'd both Extreams of the  Christian World  And the  Turks  look'd with Horror on the Vengeance which they saw so  near  themAnd in this only Particular I am sorry to observe that the Author of the NORTHEN STAR was less a  Prophet  than he imagin'd  Death  intercepted the glorious Race when the  Goal  was just in View and left the GREEKS not  yet  so  happy  as that Writer had foretold them  Grecia  's lost Fame shall be restor'd by

DEALER  SIR  THERE are none of your Essays which more intitle you to my Esteem than those which you have been inspir'd with by the most generous and gentle Passion that acts on and adorns HumanityI need not tell you after this that the Passion I mean is LOVEYou have eonfess'd yourself a  Lover  and if you  had not  I should have  guess'd it  by the Warmth and Spirit of your Sentiments when you attempt any thing on that SubjectA  Warmth  and  Spirit  Mr PLAIN DEALER which agree so ill with your  Grand Climacte∣rick  that if it were not for the  implicite Reve∣rence  with which I conclude myself  mistaken  when you assert what I find  difficult  to  be∣lieve  I should suppose your  Age  as chime∣rical  as your  Situation  and no more look for you among the  Old  than upon the  WatchTower  of  Barbican  BUT let  that  pass No matter whether you are  Old  or  no  since I will admit that you are  Venerable  I reverence  you  for that Reverence with which you speak of  Love  and the  Ladies  The  light World  Mr PLAIN DEALER have no Taste for the refined Ideas which almost  deify  this sacred Passion But let me perish if I would exchange the  Enjoyment  of my  Mi∣stress's Soul  for the most unbounded Pro∣perty in her  angelick Body  The Blessing is  fullest  I confess when  both  these go  together  But the  First  without the  Last  can give me  Tenderness Endearment  and the Delight of sweet  Reflection  whereas the  Last  without the  First  would in spite of all its Transports carry with it an un∣satisfying and reluctant  Void  of  Thought  which would rob it of its  finest  Relish For who would  dare  to  think  at all when if he thinks he must be sensible that he is receiving from an  unconsenting Heart  the last and dearest  Obligation  which can spring from  Love  and  Gratitude  THE  Cold  and  Grave  perhaps may think That there is  Levity  in  Loving  to such sweet Excess as I do I too once thought as they thinkBut Time and the remember'd Converse of a Wo∣man  softer  than the  First Idea's  of her  Sex's Innocence and  wiser  and more  solid  than their  last Reflections  when they  leave  a World that flatter'd them have taught me that there is no Joy on Earth so  real  and so  lasting  as the Union of a Soul so charm'd as mine is with the Soul that has so charm'd it  Absence  Mr PLAIN DEALER and a Thousand Obstacles I dare not name have interposed their cruel Influence And I have almost Cause to  fear  my Tenderness and Constancy are  doubted  even by the lovely  Object  of them And yet I never pass a Moment which takes not its  Pain  or  Pleasure  chiefly from the Part  Her  everpresent Image bears in the Occasion The Memory of  Her  dear Interest in me gives  Spirit  to my  Hope Mitigation  to my  Sorrow  and  Moderation  to my  Anger  If I  fear  it is  for Her  And if I  wish  it is to  make her happy  She  alleviates  all my  Cares  and yet she  quickens  and  increases  them She is my  Business  when I have  Leisure  and my  Leisure  when I am in the midst of  Business  She is the  Paradox  and  Riddle  of my Life I have the Mis∣fortune to live  absent  from her yet is she never  out of my Company  I am notmust notcannot be  Her's  and yet  am only Her's  for Ever  I REMEMBER when I had the Blessing of seeing her oft'ner I once painted my Soul's full Meaning in the following Copy of Verses to her or something not much  unlike themBe so good as to  insert  them she sometimes sees your Paper and they may awaken the Remembrance of a Passion she perhaps  relaxes from  I hope Her Soul does Justice to the Impres∣sion which  mine  glows with But let Her Thoughts of  Me  be  kind  or  less partial  than they  have been  I must never expect the Power which I am sure I shall never  wish for

were not  some Comfort  that he appears to  think  like a  modest Lover  I should have been out of all Patience to have had my Sobriety so artfully made a  stalking Horse  to the  amorous Plots  of these young  Fellows  and their  Sweethearts  who tell one another their Minds under Pretence of  writing to the  PLAIN DEALER But as it is I forgive the  Stratagem  merely for the sake of the  Poetry  which I own I am pleas'd with because it is  natural  and seems to have flow'd from the  Heart  which is a warmer Inspirer than  Helicon  The Plain Dealer No  Justum Tenacem propositi Virum  HOR  FRIDAY  April    DESIGNING to be grave to Day on the sober Subject of RESOLUTION I will bribe my Reader's Attention to a Discourse less  gay  than  useful  by telling them a short  Story  in the very Front of my Paper  SALADIN  the  Soldan  of  Aegypt  tho' he had Dominions enough of his own was always ready when Occasion offered to  make free  with other People'sAt his Return without Success from the Siege of  Mosoul  in  Syria  he seized into his Hands the whole Lordship of  Emessa  in Prejudice to the Right of  Nasir Eddin  the young Prince who clai∣med it And  this  he did upon Pretence That the late  Father  of the Youth had  for∣feited  by giving Countenance to Consedera∣cies against the  Soldan  's Interest  SALADIN  however ordered That proper Care should be taken of the injur'd Prince's Education and being desirous to ob∣serve  what Progress he made in his Studies he was brought one Day before the  Soldan  who asked him with much Gravity  In what Part of the Alcoran he was Reading  I am come reply'd the young Prince to the  Surprize of all  who were near him to that Verse which informs me That  He  who  de∣vours  the  Estates  of ORPHANS is not a  King  but a  Tyrant  THE  Soldan  was much startled at the Turn and Spirit of his  Repartee  but after some Pause and Recollection return'd the Youth this generous AnswerHe who  speaks  with such  Resolution  would  act  with so much  Courage  that I  restore  you to your Father's Possessions lest I should be thought to stand in  Fear  of a Virtue which I only  reverence  SUCH an Influence has  Firmness  even in  Words  and  Appearance  But when reduced into  Practice  it is productive of  innumerable Benefits  So that were I to be asked by a Man of Sense  Which would be his shortest Road to Felicity  My Answer should be The Path which leads thro'  Constancy  and  Resolution  No other  Road  but this and no other  Guide  than  Conscience  can carry him  through  his Journey and bring him  safe  to the  End  he aims at  RESOLUTION in  Life  is like  Action  in  Orato∣ry  as  Demosthenes  described it It is the  First Second  and  Third  Thing necessary The Soul is endowed with Three powerful Faculties  the  Understanding  the  Memory  and the  Will  but with regard to  moral Life  they all Three lie  dead  without the Help of  Resolu∣tion  Resolution is their  Parent  their  Mid∣wife  and their  Nurse  It first impregnates them with  Activity  then  delivers  them in their  Labours  and  nourishes  the Effects of those Labours with  Perseverance  What im∣ports it to  know  either the  Good  or the  Pro∣per  if we  forget  or  overlook  that Know∣ledge Or to what End do we  remember  what is Great and Heroick in others if  Re∣solution  does not conform our Will to coope∣rate with our Understanding  RESOLUTION therefore is the spiritual Uni∣on of the Mind's best Faculties and may not improperly be called the  Soul  of the very  Soul  itselfIt exercises the Understanding into  Meditation  Meditation gives Life to Memory and reduces  Good Will  into Habit and Habitual Good Will inspires the Memo∣ry and Understanding to break beautifully forth into a Series of  good Actions  FOR this Reason I have often reflected that we stand more in Need of being  remind∣ed  than of being  taught  and that whoever would lead Men to be  good  that is to be  happy  should rather inspire them with Reso∣lution to  do  what they know to be right than to learn  what it is  to do rightly Mo∣ral Arguments should be chiefly applied to the  Memory  and are  Incentives  to the  Will  rather than  Aids  to the  Understanding  THIS is evident methinks from the fol∣lowing Considerations  Wisdom  as it regards practical Life is no more than a Faculty of discerning what is Good from what is Evil what is to be embraced and what rejectedNow if the wisest Man upon Earth by the Dint only of  Resolution  could bring himself to  practise  what a Man of the most mode∣rate Faculties  comprehends  and  distinguishes  he would indeed be a  wise Man  according to the genuine Signification But as the World goes were we strictly to measure the Capacities even of the  Wisest  by their  Actions  we should be mortified into a Ne∣cessity of considering this vast Globe but as a Stage full of  busy Fools  with scarce a steady Purpose among them And however the Philosophers may have declared a  Vacuum  an Absurdity in  Nature  we should plainly discover one in  Sense  among the Agents of the intellectual World We must therefore conclude That the Fault lies not in the  Un∣derstanding  but the  Will  nor proceeds from Want of Knowledge but Deficiency of Firm∣ness and Resolution Mr DRYDEN speak∣ing of Men in their  thinking  and  contempla∣tive  Faculty says somewhere to the Praise of the  meanest  Writers That he never read any Argument so  indifferently  handled out of which a  wise  Man might not gather some∣thing that was  valuable  And  Cardinal  RICHLIEU has observ'd concerning  active  and  political  Life That he knew many to  whom the Direction of great  Kingdoms  might be happily committed in the  Morning  whom yet in the  Afternoon  he would scarce trust with the  Administration  of his  Henroost  A LITTLE common Thief knows he  should not  commit Injustice and understands well enough when he commits itbut wan∣ting  Resolution  to be  publickly needy  rather than  privately dishonest  he deviates from the  real  Good and ventures upon the  appearing  How often has the  Judge  acted the  Felon  upon the Bench and robb'd before  their  Faces who  accuse Robbers  at his Tribunal He  dares commit  the very Crime which he is seated there to condemn But he wants  Resolution  to de∣spise the Bribe though he has not the Felon's  Necessity  to plead in Excuse of it The poor Thief in this Case as  silly  as he looks at the  Bar  stands in Need of no  Instructor  But the Judge himself as  wise  as he appears in his  Furs  wants a  Remembrancer  at his El∣bow to put him in Mind of his Duty  COMMON Gamesters  know so well the Ignominy of giving  false Judgment  at a pub∣lick  HazardTable  that they have generally  Resolution  enough to resist very great secret Temptations that Way and have seldom been found guilty though  Custom  and not  Conscience  is the Motive of their Forbear∣ance But how  little History  need we read to know That we have had Dispensers of Equity who have been in the utmost  Neces∣sity  of Plaindealing  Monitors  not indeed to  instruct  them but to put them in  Mind  that  Equity was not Iniquity  We  all  of us  know  but  few  or  none  of us  think  We distinguish not the Things that lie  before  us through the  Mistiness  of  Avarice  or any other intervening Passion It cannot be said that we are un∣able to  see  But that we  see  without  Discern∣ment  The  Understanding  has  Eyes  but  Ir∣resolution  has  jaundic'd  them  HOW does  Ambition  reduce and mislead those whom we call  wise  Men into auk∣ward Condescensions which make them cheap in the very Eyes of the  Vulgar  How often have we seen  Pride  and  Insolence  assume the Flexure of the  sneaking Candidate  in order to  strut  immediately after in the Abuse of intrusted  Office  The  Farce of  DOCTOR FAUSTUS has been represented as  light  and  ridiculous  because its  Plot  is  no more  than that while the  Conjurer  enjoys his  Wand  he enjoys his Wishes  That Wand  converts every Thing into the Accomplishment of his Purposes But no sooner is his  Term  of holding that  White Staff expired  than the  Conjuration expires  with it and he is the poorest weak∣est most despairing and most abandon'd Wretch alive This every Spectator sees  through  and  laughs  at and yet how happy might it have been for some other  Wandhol∣ders  of this Kingdom if that poor  Farce  had been acted before them instead of  their  duller  State Interludes  in order to serve as a useful  Memorial  that they should not misuse  those Wands  like FAUSTUS that is play Tricks till their  Time is out  and then be  delivered up  to the  Devil  AS  little  Men become  great  by  Resolution  and  great Men  degenerate into  little  ones with∣out it so  Admonitions  to those Duties which every  little Man  knows are  necessary  notwith∣standing to the  Wisest  Of this ALEXANDER's Father PHILIP demonstrated himself very sensible That Prince's  Servant knew  no doubt as well as his  Master  that a  King  was no more than a  Man  But PHILIP mind∣ful that high Fortune had often made  light Heads forget  themselves commanded this Ser∣vant to wake him every Morning by this wellknown Lesson in his Ear  Remem∣ber thou art but a Man  Now many would be apt to imagine that little Profit could arise from such constant Repetition of this short and needless Intimation Yet Sir FRANCIS BACON who  knew  well both the  great  World and the  little  has left us the following  Axiom  concerning it  "All  moni∣torial  Precepts concerning  Kings  are in Effect comprehended in these Two  Remem∣brancesRemember thou art a ManRemember thou art  GOD  's Vicegerent  The  one  bridleth their  Power  the other their  Will  "  In Truth if ALEXANDER had affected to be no more than he was the Son of PHILIP instead of aspiring to Divinity and the Title of AMMON he would have  more  than conquer'd the World for he would have conquered the very Conqueror of it  RESOLUTION then is the only Means to make a Man compleatly  happy  and frequent  Admonition  serves to keep  Resolution  alive The  Lowest  can scarce stand in Need of a mo∣ral  Instruction  but the  Highest  may be greatly indebted for  Admonition  and consequently all young Men who propose to make any Figure in publick Employments should give Ear to a  Plain Dealer  who dares put them in Mind of their WeaknessA Man who has Firmness enough to  see  the  Worst  of his own Soul will soon have the Satisfaction to find the Prospect much  better'd  He will learn Patience in  ill  Fortune and Abstinence in  good  He will be fortified with  Resolu∣tion  to be  humble just  and  charitable  amidst the strongest  Inflations  and Indulgements of  Prosperity  and disdain to be found  envious dejected  or  revengeful  amidst the  bitterest  Resentments and Sollicitations of  Calamity  Such a Man shall not only preserve an inward Tranquility but whatever the Colour of his Fortune may be he will owe a Lustre to  Himself  and cast it round him upon  Others  He will not only be  followed  but  beloved  in his  Prosperity  and in his  Adversity  he will be  lamented  The Plain Dealer N  o    Glaucumque Medontaque Thersilochumque  VIRG  MONDAY  April    To the  PLAINDEALER  SIR  IT is with no small Expectation that I observe you in some of your Papers making Excursions into the Province of  Criticism  It is a Subject not only  Enter∣taining  but  Instructive  And there is no kind of Knowledge in which those gay Spirits who are loudest and most ready in giving Judgment are so contemptibly and lamentably Deficient as in the Art of  Judg∣ing rightly  TWO Improvements might be hop'd for in the Taste of most Readers from a more general Propagation of the Knowledge of  distinguishing clearly  We should neither be ashamed to praise the Merit of the Obscu∣rest  rest of our  Cotemporaries  nor afraid to cen∣sure the Errors of the most Popular among  ancient  Writers  HOMER  's famous Catalogue of  Gre∣cian  Ships and their Commanders would then I am apt to believe cease to pass for one of his Sublimest and most Poetical Beauties Its Geographieal Exactness would no longer be pleaded as a Ballance against the Dryness and Tediousness of its Histo∣rical Enumeration Since it is no Part of a  Poet's  Business to teach the Situation Bounds and Quality of Countries Little occasional Descriptions of that kind 'tis true may sometimes be necessary and being artfully introduced and handled might not only  diversify  a Poem but also render it  delightful  Without which last Quality the whole Labour is lost And nothing certainly can  delight  that is  tire∣som  and  heavy  BUT the Bigotry of a Succession of un∣poetical  Commentators  Men of Learning without Genius has heap'd upon this Ca∣talogue such profuse and illjudg'd  Enco∣mium  that the whole Herd of Imitators from the  Tasso  's of  Italy  down to the  Black∣more  's of  Britain  have lengthen'd out their hostile  MusterRolls  to the Terror and Pro∣vocation even of the most patient of their gentle Readers And some of these have been fortunate enough to meet with Ap∣plause more extravagant even than  Ho∣mer  's  For they have been compar'd with and  preferr'd  to  Homer  's Witness  Ben Johnson  's commendatory  Vision  printed be∣fore the old Edition of DRAYTON  's  Battle of  Agincourt  There  Thou art  Homer  Pray thee  use  the Style  Thou hast  deserv'd  and let me read the while  Thy  CATALOUE of SHIPS cxceeding his  THE Catalogue here meant is of those Ships which transported the  English  For∣ces in our  Henry the Fifth's  first Attempt upon  France  I will entertain the Reader with this so highly applauded Cata∣logue because it may deserve to stand as a  Proof  what poor Products we are to ex∣pect from a servile and implicite Imitation  And first Seven Ships from  Rochester  are sent  The  Bonadventure George  and the  Expence  Antilope Henry Elephant Defence  Bottoms as good as ever  spread  a  Clue  All having Charge their Voyge having been  Before  Southampton  to take Soldiers in  Twelve Merchant Ships of mighty Burthen all  New off the Stocks that had been rigg'd for  Stoad  Riding in  Thames  by  Limehouse  and  Blackwall  That ready were their Merchandize to load  Eight goodly Ships from  Bristol  ready made  With  Spanish Wine  which they for Ballast lade  And as these Eight the  Severn  Sea do stem  Five more from  Padstow  came along with them  From  Plymouth  next came in the  BlazingStar  And  Fiery Dragon  to take in their Fraught  With other Four especial Men of War  That in the Bay of  Portugal  had fought  The  Hare  of  Loo  a right good Ship well known  That twice the Year before the Streights had past  Two wealthy  Spanish  Merchants did her own  Who then but newly had repair'd her waste  And from  Mount'sBay  Six more that still in Sight  Waited with her before the  Isle of Wight  Nine Ships for the Nobility there went  Of able Men the Enterprize to aid  Northumberland  and  Westmoreland  in sent  Fourscore at Arms apiece and themselves laid  At Sixscore Archers each as  Suffolk  shows  Twenty tall Men at

all the Sea had been on Flame  Then Skiffs Crays Scallops and the like why these  From every small Creek cover'd all the Seas  THIS though a bald and unlovely Imi∣tation of  Homer  is better I think in one Sense than the Original by so much as it is  shorter  for no Man of Reason will be perswaded to believe that in a Poem of this kind such a tedious and dry List of a Fleet though it preserves a particular Piece of Antiquity which is the Commentators weak Defence for  Homer  can stand agree∣ably in the Place of Invention Spirit Fan∣cy and the Energy of Poetry  SUCH a barren and distinct Enumeration gives a wearisom Satiety to the Mind and drags too hard on the Attention When I read for so many Leaves together not what Persons  do  but who they  are  and whence they  came  without any of that enlivening Variety of Circumstance or De∣scription which should relieve the Imagi∣nation it puts me in Mind of our Ancestors simple  Epitaphs  Honest People who thought it Merit enough to have lived married and got Children without load∣ing their Tombstones with the Weight of their  Actions  Of  Wiliam Wilson Joan  his Wife  And  Alice  their Daughter dear  These Lines be left to give

Number Fourth  One for his  Virtue  made a  Lord  And call'd Sir  Edward North  AMONG all these copious Particularities there is nothing that deserv'd the telling if we except the great Rarity that comes in the Rear A Man made a  Lord  for his  Virtue  That indeed must be own'd to have been a Wonder worth recording It was consider'd too it seems as an Accident so unusual that the good Man appears by the last Verse to have been ashamed of his Singularity and rather chose to stick fast to his old knightly Title of Sir  Edward  than  be pointed at as he passed the Streets for a kind of Miracle But here follows some∣thing which no Poet's List among them all can compare with for Exactness  This Life hath on Earth no certain While  Example by  John Mary  and  Oliver Stile  Who under

is necessary for the Difference between the  Verses  a Man is apt to conclude That a Poet too prolix in the Lists I have been speaking of has as little to say for the Actions of the greatest Part of his Captains as these very exact  Epi∣taphs  for the  Oliver  's  Alice  's  Joan  's and  Andrew  's who occasioned them  I am SIR Your Constant Reader And Humble Servant  c  The Plain Dealer No  Nos populo damus  SEN  FRIDAY  April    To the  Author  of the  PLAINDEALER  Oh Dear Mr  PLAIN DEALER  MANY a Lady has been charm'd into a Passion for her future Lover upon Sight only of his  Picture  But my Fate is the very Reverse of This For be∣fore I saw the  Picture  of my  Florello  I was almost in Love with the  Original  Where∣as now I am fallen absolutely in Love with the Picture and can scarce bear the Sight of That odious Lover of mine who  sat  for it  THE Picture you must know is a Kind of Paradox For it is drawn but in  Black  and  White  and yet glows with the live∣liest Force and most natural Mixture of strong  Colouring  It is  One  of a valuable  Collection  which was expos'd to Publick Sale last Week under Title of  The  UNIVERSAL  PASSION  Part  IIWou'd to Heaven I knew the Painter A Hand so exquisite at  Touching  should  take me  as often as I cou'd possibly sit to him Nay I wou'd sooner be drawn by  Him  than by  Apelles  or  Ti∣tian  or  Lilly  or  Vandike  or by any Pen∣cil ancient or modern  except that only  to which we owe so many envyraising Pic∣tures of my Friend Mrs  Arabella Farmor  NOT but there is infinite Difference be∣tween the Two Pieces and the  Lines  in∣deed are strikingly distinguish'd in bothIn the  Lady  's They are  sweet soft de∣licate  In my  Florello  's They are  strong bold glaring Florello  's very  Life  is not half so  lively  as this fine Painter's  speaking Representation  of itSee the  Fi∣gure  and the  Spirit  the  Grace  and  Pas∣sion  of the Picture  OF late at  White  's was young  Florello  seen  How  blank  his Look how  discompos'd  his Mien  In  Grief Sincere  so hard it proves to feign  Sunk were his Spirits for his  Coat  was  plain  NEXT Day his Breast regain'd its wonted Peace  His Health was mended with a  Silver Lace  A curious Artist long inur'd to Toils  Of gentler sort with Combs and fragrant Oils  Whether by  Chance  or by some  God  inspir'd  So touch'd his  Curls  his mighty  Soul

his Heart  But Fate ordains that  dearest Friends must part  In active Measures brought from  France  he wheels  And triumphs conscious of his  learned Heels  TO deal plainly with the PLAIN DEALER just after I had been reading this mortifying Description of the Man whom I had been weak enough to feel some little Tenderness for His Evil Genius danc'd in with him and I blush'd to my very Forehead to re∣flect that I shou'd owe to the lively  Paint∣ing  of a  Satire  my first Discovery that the  Florello  who had been so intimately my Acquaintance was the Reverse of a  Fine Gentleman  PRAY publish This Extraordinary  Cure  in Justice to the Skill and Reputation of the Learned  Doctor  who effected it And assist thereby the good Wishes and the Gratitude of  Dear Mr  PLAIN DEALER  Your unknown humble Servant  CLARASTELLA  Friday March    Mr  PLAINDEALER  AS You are a Gentleman of Penetrati∣on and capable of rendring every Thing that is offer'd to You in a brighter Capacity than I am which occurr'd to me upon reading your Paper of  Friday March  the th in Relation to PUGG  's Complaint  against that  Feathery Fool  called a PARROT in a House that is just over against him I I desire that in your next you would only give Caution to a certain Lady whose Lodgings are opposite to mine That she does not indulge PUGG as I have seen her in all that provoking and unmerited Free∣dom of  pawing  her upon the  Mouth  and  Bosom  Flesh and Blood Mr PLAIN DEALER is not able to bear it and if we must not cast the  Food  of  Man  to  Dogs  I am sure it is much less lawful to bestow His Right upon an  ugly Monkey  In short I am out of all manner of  Patience  and if this Lady will not be so kind as to keep my Rival out of my Sight I must be forc'd to  brick up my Windows  or remove to a  new Lodging  For I wou'd not methinks be so unreasonable as to quarrel with PUGG  Himself  about it Since He looks to con∣fess the Truth as if He was  born  to be the  Lady's Favourite  I am SIR Your afflicted Reader  P A  March    SIR  YOU will much oblige one of your constant Readers and very great Ad∣mirers if you will but answer me this Quere  viz  In your Excellent PLAIN DEALER of  August  the th N  o  treating of  Love  wherein is contain'd part of that lovely POEM on the same Subject I find these Lines  Absent from  Her  in whom alone we  live  Life grows a  Bankrupt  and no  Bliss  can give  Friends are  IMPORTUNATE  and Pleasures  lost  c  NOW all the Question is Whether that is not a Mistake of the Printer's putting  Importunate  for  Impertinent  or Whether I in Justice to you for giving this Trouble shou'd not write myself  Wantof  WIT  TO a  Lover  who retires to  Solitude  for a quiet and uninterrupted Indulgment of his Passion the very  Civilities  and  good Offices  of Friendship are unwelcome and the Pressure of them is  Importunately  trouble∣some and this was doubtless the Sense in which the Author of that Poem made use of the Word  ImportunateImperti∣nent  had been less applicable as well as less elegant because it is the  Duty  of a  Friend to be solicitous in advising and com∣forting us however  uneasy  he makes us by the Effect of his disrelish'd Intention So that my Correspondent will  name  him∣self more justly if in the next Letter he favours me with he changes his Subscripti∣on from  Wantof  WIT only to  Wantof  ATTENTION  To the  PLAIN DEALER  SIR  I HAVE perceived quite through the Course of your Papers that your Ten∣dency is not only to  Delight  your Read∣ers but to  Inform  and  Refine  them Up∣on this Consideration I must persuade my∣self you will set the following Subject in the strongest Light which the more ef∣fectually to recommend it to you I assure you it is not fictitious but real Matter of FactThere is a certain Widow who has two Sons and two Daughters the for∣mer of which are arrived to the State which writes them  Men  both brought up to creditable Employments but neither of them capable of proceeding in their Business without her Assistance which tho' very able to give she  refuses  them  YOU will be more than a little surprized when I tell you there is a Person beyond Description rustical and unlovely who  makes his aukward Addresses to the  Wealth  of this Widow And that this is the  Con∣sideration  which she prefers to the Welfare of her Children who have urg'd her on their Knees to regard not only  Their Good  but what the World will say of  herself  Deaf to all their Intercessions she continu∣ally repulses them and is unalterably de∣termined on her  own  and  their  Ruin  NOW I would beg of you to tell me What Motive can induce her to this And to account for it in a  Physical  Manner Should not the moving Wants and Depen∣dance of her own Children prevail more upon her  Nature  than the interested Ad∣dresses of a  Stranger  For I am afraid there are no Incentives to  Love  on either Side and I am loth to give it its  other Name  If Sir you insert this as soon as you can in your Paper you may do a real Good and at the same Time you will oblige one of your constanr Readers  I am SIR  c  MY good Friend  Tony Jyngle  whom I have not seen till lately since the Death of Sir  Portly Rufus  of which I gave my Readers the melancholy History in one of my former Papers was just come to visit me as I had received this Letter from the Publisher And upon hearing it read told me with much Force of Politeness and Penetration  That there were  certain Politick Reasons  against accounting in a  Physical  Manner for the  Motive  which  induces  this  unmanageable Widow  But he was of Opinion it might do as as well if I accounted for it  Poetically  And to that end he favour'd me within Fifteen Minutes and a Half quarter with the

Structure the im∣mense but beautiful Extent and Order of  Creation  demand not the  Notice  only but the  Veneration  of every reaso∣nable Being No less than  infinite Wisdom  could conceive the Plan nor less than  Al∣mighty Power  erect the Fabrick Our Sight is struck with Amazement when we look but upon a stately Building the mere Ef∣fect of Human Invention And yet to the Shame of our Stupidity be it spoken we can consider the  Earth  we live on with  Indifference  we can walk under the  Lamps  of  Heaven  without being inlightened by the smallest Glimmering of Divine Re∣flection nor to many do they argue any  thing greater than  Chance  which in other Words is  Nothing  YET certainly no Knowledge can be so  delightful  to the Soul as  This  which is at the same Time the  noblest  and most  useful  that can busy us in our short Pil∣grimage through the  Body  Nay The ex∣cellent Mr  Ray  has very pleasingly imagi∣ned that it may be Part of our Business and Employment to all Eternity to dis∣cover still deeper and deeper into the un∣fathomable Works of God and contem∣plate the Glory of his Wisdom Power and Goodness  I AM sensible You concur with me that the  Honour  due to  God  should excite the noblest of our Thoughts and Actions be∣cause You have endeavour'd to make our Lives in their good Purposes and their Lustre resemble the Coelestial Bodies and  move  for their  own  and for  other's  Benefit And since you have not refused to exert your Genius toward refining inlarging and advancing our Ideas of Divine Greatness So doubtless you will oblige your Rea∣ders in the Sequel of this Letter with a Trace of Reflections for which we are in∣debted to the Author of that excellent Dis∣course  The Religion of Nature Delineated  I am SIR Your Humble Servant  PHILOTHEUS  WHAT a vast Field for Contempla∣tion is opened in those Regions of  Matter  about us in which there is not the least Particle but carries with it an Argument of God's Existence not the smallest Trifle but shews it nor the slight∣est Motion produced the softest Whisper of the Air but tells itThe Frame and Constitution of the World the asto∣nishing Magnificence of it the various Kinds of Beings and the Constancy ob∣served in the Productions of Things and the Uses for which they are produc'd do all shew that there is some  Almighty De∣signer  at the Top of all these Things Such  Marks  they  bear  of his Power and Wis∣dom  IN order to prove to any Doubter the the Grandeur of this Fabrick we need only bid him consider the  Sun  with that insupportable Glory that surrounds it The vast Distance Magnitude and Heat of it The Planets periodically moving in their several Orbits about it with all their  Re∣gular Variety  of Aspects guarded some of them by  secondary Planets  and as it were  emulating  the State of the  Sun  and pro∣bably all These possess'd by distinct and proper  Inhabitants  Let him think of those surprizing Visits the  Comets  make us the large Trains of uncommon Splendor which attend them the  far Country  they  come from and the Curiosity and Horror they excite not only among  us  but in the Inhabitants of the Worlds about us who also may be  up  as we are to see the  Entry  and  Progress  of these new Ministers of the AlmightyLet him direct his Eye and Contemplation through those azure Regi∣ons above him up to the  fixed Stars  that radiant and numberless  Host  of  Heaven  and reflect but how unlikely it is that they should be placed there only to adorn and bespangle our Canopy He will then instruct himself that they are so many  other  SUNS with their several Regions and and dependant Planets about them He will further discern by the Help of Glasses still more and more of these  fixed Lights  and exalt himself to an Apprehension of their unaccountable Numbers and of the Immensity of those Spaces that lie re∣tired beyond not our  Ken  only but even our  Imagination  Here on light Fancy's saily Wings I rise  Aw'd and confounded thro' deep  Wilds  of  Air  Millions of op'ning Wonders strike my Eyes  And  Reason  's finite View is  dazzled  there  Globes behind Globes unnumber'd hence appear  The twinkling  Stars  that from dim Earth  remote  Seem heav'nset  Gems  and  scatter'd Seeds of Day  Here  Buoyant  Worlds  midst Seas of  Aether  flote  And o'er  blue Kingdoms  hold a fiery Sway  In distant Orbits round each reigning Star  Huge  Earths  and  Moons  their cirly Homage pay  Millions of countless Miles are  lost between  And sick'ning  Thought  grows  tir'd  to stretch so far  How  brightly vast  each concave  Sphere  is seen  Th'  enormous Vaults  with wheeling Worlds  glow  round  Rolling  oblique  yet none their Paths  confound    Their crossing Currents cause no clashing  Jars  Nor one the other's Progress  bars  Wide round their central  Suns  their  Tours  they make  Yet no proud Planet dares his  Line  forsake  Partial an intercepted Ray to break  They  take  and  lend  by Turns the streaming Light  And form in solemn Silence  Day  and  Night  WE need only consider these Things which are now known almost to every Body and by them we shall be taught that a Structure so infinite must be the Work of an infinite ArchitectBut if we could take a particular View of all that astonishing Compass which we have thus hastily run over how would  Wonders mul∣tiply  upon us Every Part of every World is as it were made up of  other  Worlds If we examine  This our Earth  what Scope is here for AdmirationWhat Varie∣ty of Mountains Hills Valleys Plains Rivers Seas Trees Plants What num∣berless Tribes of different Animals is it stock'd with How unwearied are the In∣ventions and Works of  one  of these which is MAN And yet when they are  all survey'd as nicely as they can be whether by our unassisted Senses or the Help of  Telescopical  Glasses the Assistance of  Microscopes  in the  smallest  Parts of  Mat∣ter  will go on to discover as many new Wonders as those which have already been made known to us New Kingdoms of Animals new Architecture and Cu∣riosity of Workmanship and Oeconomy So that as  before  our Conception fainted in those boundless Journeys we were obliged to take through the expansive Vastness of the Universe here on the other Hand we tire ourselves with fruit∣less Researches into the Principles and con∣stituent Parts of it Both the  Beginnings  and the  End  of Things the  Least  and the  Greatest  all conspire to perplex us And which every way we prosecute our In∣quiries we still fall in with fresh Subjects of Amazement and fresh Reasons to be∣lieve that there are more and more be∣hind that will for ever escape our eagerest and most successful Penetration We have  Philosophy  indeed but the Misfortune is it dwells but in the  Surface  of Nature  IT appears then plainly enough in the Parts and Model of the World that there is a  Contrivance  and a Respect to certain  Reasons  and  Ends  Why else is the Sun posited near the Middle of our  System  but for the more convenient dis∣pensing of his Influence to the Planets  moving about him Why else does the Plan of the Earth's  Aequator  intersect that of her  Orbit  and make a proper  Angle  with it but in order to diversify the Year and create a useful  Variety  of  Seasons  Many other Things of this kind tho' a thousand Times repeated will be always delightful Observations to good Men and true Scholars None of whom can observe those Vapours which ascend from the Sea to meet in  Clouds  above and fall back again after  Condensation  without understanding the Purpose of this providential  Distillation  to be a Division of the Water from its grosser  Salts  that by Rains and Dews it may return upon and supply the Fountains and refreshing Rivers nourishing the Vegetables by Show∣ers which therefore descend not in Cata∣racts but kindly Drops as from a Water∣pot upon a Garden  WHO can view the Structure of a  Plant  or an  Animal  the indefinite Number of their  Fibres  and fine  Vessels  their Depen∣dance upon  larger  and the several Mem∣bers upon  them  and the apt Disposition of all these the Provision that is made for Reception and Distribution of Nourish∣ment the Effect of this Nourishment in Extension of the Vessels stretching the  Ve∣getable  or  Animal  gradually to its full and determinate Growth maintaining the Motion of the several  Fluids  repairing the  Decays of the Body and comforting and preserving Life Who can take Notice of the various  Faculties  of Animals their Arts of saving and providing for themselves or the Means by which they are provided for the Uses of  Plants  to Animals and of some Animals to  others  and of the Generality of them to  Mankind  the Propagation of the several Species out of their  proper  Seeds without Confusion the strong Inclinations implanted for that Purpose and the Ten∣derness even of the Fiercest to their  Young  Who I say can view all this and not con∣fess a  Design  and an  omnipotent Designer  The meanest Insect which scarce appears at all to our naked Eye will when viewed through a Microscope present a Prospect a Thousand Times more curious and surprizing than the finest Piece of  Mechanism  that ever was made by  Man  For my own Part as I cannot but ac∣knowledge that I am  fearfully  and  won∣derfully formed  I likewise believe as firmly that some superintendent Hand hath  conducted  and  protected me  from my Birth to this present Moment or that in the Words of the most Sacred of all  Wri∣tingsThere is a God in whom I live move and have my Being  WHO then that judges of this God by his  Works  and his  Mercy  will be afraid of that  Death  which must bring us one Stage  nearer  him Nay who knows but  that what we  call  DEATH may be our real and proper LIFE and this which we think our  Life  a kind of  dark  and  dreaming Interval  which Death only comes to  awaken  and  redeem  us from For my Part I look forward on the Hour of my  Dissolution  with the Hope and Ex∣pectation of escaping  Mariners  who ha∣ving been sinking all Night long in a Rudderless and Foundring Vessel disco∣ver with the Dawn of the Morning the opening Coast of some  lovely  though  un∣known  Country I support  Life  as my  Duty  rather than enjoy it as my  Wish  And will borrow another  Stanza  from the same Poem whence I took that above to express the Sentiments I feel in my self after such a Trace of serious Reflections as those which compose this Paper  But murmur not proud Heart if here delay'd  A wandring Pilgrim through this Life's cold Shade  I must not  yet  in Heaven's wide Search rejoyce  O be the Will of  God  not  mine  obey'd  Wait my impatient Soul  His  wiser Choice  Trust the strong Hand by which  those Worlds  were made  And to  His Pleasure  tune

He who beyond the Power of  Man  cou'd  WRITE  Wou'd  still  fall short of  Him  who  ACTED  well  To flow in Sound or turn a Period right  Is but in  Fairy Towers  of Praise to dwell  But  Wrongs  to

   I AM though a great Lover of  Trade  a declar'd Enemy to the Company of  Vintners  and profess That my Indignation daily rises against them more and more in proportion as they daily deviate from their first laudable Institution Taverns were in∣tended at their primitive Erection as pub∣lick  Refectories  where Men whose Business called them Abroad from their Families and single Gentlemen who had no Familes at all might resort for a chearful and necessary Refreshment So that  Taverns  stood in this Town for much the same End as  Inns  are commodiously situated up and down the Country But by the Use they are now con∣verted to Men are not  refresh'd  there but  debauch'd  and taken off from the Pursuit of their Business  I WAS led into this Subject on the Eve of a late drunken Holiday when returning Home in a melancholy Disposition at a later Hour than usual I was unexpectedly saluted with an unlucky Piece of News that a Kins∣man who notwithstanding all that a famous Predecessor of mine had wittily remark'd in Ridicule of that silly Practice wou'd try to drive to himself Home on the  Coachbox  when he was scarce able to get into the  Coach  without the Help of its  proper Driver  had by the Way got so dangerous a Fall that he was thrown almost out of the World And just as I was plung'd into a profound Meditation on this ill Accident Word was brought me That  Literatus  and  Urbanus  two Bosom Intimates having drank toge∣ther to Excess the latter lost his  Civility  and the former his  Wits  so far as to push on a Dis∣pute about a mere Trifle 'till one of them was killed and his  Friend  and  Murderer  left behind to imbitter his surviving Days with a  Remorse  which the other's  Death  was pre∣serable toI was lost in the startling Thought how dreadful it must be to drop out of a  Temporary  into an  Eternal  Existence in so deplorable and unprepar'd a State which brought immediately to my Remem∣brance what the old King says to  Hamlet  in the Tragedy  Thus was I  Cut off ev'n in the  Blossoms  of my Sin  No  Reck'ning  made but sent to my  Account  With all my Imperfections on my Head  Oh Horrible  most  Horrible  THIS sensible and moving Complaint so awfully placed in the Mouth of a  Ghost  strikes a considerate Auditor with Terror and leaves him  warn'd  and  astonish'd  But there is a Scene in a Comedy call'd  The Ly∣ing Lovers  That comes more immediately to this Subject of a Gentleman's Stabbing his Friend in the Fury of his Drunkenness and which if it had been read or heard with At∣tention by  Urbanus  would probably have prevented his own becoming a too real Ex∣ample of  this unhappy Truth  That a Man who in the present Moment is Master of the strongest Reason Possessor of the greatest Honour and adorn'd with the finest Senti∣ments of Religion Friendship and Huma∣nity may in two or three Hours  drinking  be push'd forward by the Rage of Wine to act unheardof  Brutalities  in direct Opposi∣tion to the Impulse of all its Virtues I re∣commend this useful Scene to the Perusal of those indanger'd Adventurers who are apt to be quarrelsome in their Cups and yet dare rashly addict themselves to an habitual In∣temperance  THE Fatigue of so melancholy a Medita∣tion cast me into a disorder'd kind of Sleep in which it furnished me as  Shakespear  says with  the Stuff of which Dreams are made  My Imagination working busily upon the Tra∣ces of my waking Thoughts brought me into the Company of a Hoary and Venera∣ble Matron whose Eyes were so  piercing bright  that they seem'd to have increas'd by Age their Faculty of Penetration She told me That her Name was CAUTION and bid∣ding me follow her she conducted me as the Prophetess did  Aeneas  into one of the Regions of the  nether World  where the Shades of all those who depart this Life in the Guilt of their Debauches are doom'd to in∣habit  I FOUND my self without being able to describe the Method of my speedy Convey∣ance thither in a vast Place like an Island incompass'd with a Moat of Liquid Fire where different Crowds of People were un∣der the Torment of being  forced  to  drink  every Moment till they were deprived of their Senses and betrayed into Extravagan∣cies which never failed to fill their Hearts with Pain and Remorse for some enormous Transgression or other committed by them when so disorder'dThen the Fury that ad∣minister'd the Liquor had a Power of reco∣vering them by representing their past Acti∣ons in a Glass that serv'd them instead of  Memory  When they had suffer'd the full  Pangs of Sobriety and pain'd their Observa∣tion with what they  might  have been and what they  were  the Fury drench'd them a∣fresh with the Intoxicating Tide of Torture and this was the Repetition of a Life whose Circle compos'd a Round of Misery that never was to know an End Each Crowd was thus attended by some Deputy of in∣fernal Vengeance  THE first I took Notice of was a Com∣pany of Gentlemen who before they began to drink were of robust Make of Body they had Sanguine Complexions and carried  Health  in their whole Appearance Before these a  Devil  in the Dress of a  Drawer  had placed a vast Barrel of Liquor of which when each had got his Dose the Effects of the Poison began to work differently upon these poor Patients that seem'd lately in a State so florid Some that were of the most gigantick Size like  Father Dominick  in the  Spanish Fryer  sunk two Yards and a Half in the  Wetting  Others again who were  thin  Men were bloated by Dropsies into the Dimensions which the former had shrunk fromThey who just before had Vigour enough to outvoice their own Hunt∣ingHorns were by a Dose or two of that strange alterative Liquor brought to  squeak  like those  Pipes  which the  Boys  make of an  Oatstraw  They who used to leap FivebarGates QuicksetHedges and ParkPalings could not wag a Hand or a Foot with∣out  crying out of the Gout or the Rheuma∣tism These had been called in the World COUNTRY 'SQUIRES and were active Men in their Time at the Hunting down of a  Fox  or crying up of a  Burgess  But it was dismal to behold what Faces they made now when the Fury shew'd them their own Figures in the startling Glass of Reflection  THE next Place that old Mother CAUTION conducted me to was a gloomy Walk which the farther we penetrated into it was the deeper darkened with the Shade of  Juniper  and  Eugh  Trees In the midst was a Little Thatch'd House as full as it could hold of Earthen Vessels stor'd with a  Juice  that was but one Remove from  Poyson  The poor Wretches who frequented this dark Hovel where mostly  English  and pleaded the Privi∣lilege of their  Liberty  for getting rid of their Senses as  freely  as their Countrymen of higher Quality who paid  dearer  for the same  Right  in proportion to their better Circum∣stances and dealt in Poysons of a slower Operation Many Customers went in here but half Dress'd and came out again Naked Most of them labour'd under Miseries and Diseases without a Name and some of them endeavour'd to hang themselves on the Trees that gave a Name to the fatal Liquor  BUT I was  transported  in the next Place I came to and flatter'd my Imagination that I was got out of the infernal Regions into those which were form'd for Delight and  by the Ancients called The  Elysian Fields  I was led into a noble Edifice adorn'd with the most magnificent Furniture Gildings Sculptures Paintings GlassSconces with hun∣dreds of Wax Tapers lighted in them the Roofs ecchoed and resounded with the finest Mu∣sick that cou'd arise from the most elegant Variety of the sweetest Instruments Here was an Assembly of the most active and fine∣shap'd Gentlemen together with a Set of the most seemingly modest and beautiful Women that ever my Eyes beheldwhen immediately two  Devils  in  Masquerade appear'd  to the Company with the most complaisant and inviting Airs imaginableOne of them led the Gentlemen to a luxuri∣ous Table adorn'd with Crystals replenish∣ed with the strongest and richest Wines of all Growths and Climates and dealt Glasses round with Profusion The other which was a  She Devil  conducted the Ladies in like Manner to another Table richly ornament∣ed with Silver Equipages and Vases of the finest  China  which were filled as she pre∣tended with Liquors that promoted  Sobri∣ety  but had really so different an Effect that the Fumes and Vapours arising from their  Brimmers  forced me to remove to a greater Distance  This  drinking  Scene being finished the Word was given to  Mask  and  Dance  But instead of forming a regular Motion the whole Company Male and Female without  Distinction of Sex Age or Condition fell jumbled into one promiscuous Heap upon which ensued horrid Outcries and a confus'd Clash of Swords from Men who were mur∣dering one another about Daughters Wives and Sisters So that in a Moment me∣thought like the shifting of a Scene in Dr  Faustus  this fine Apartment was chang'd in∣to an  Hospital  distinguish'd into little Clo∣sets like CellsIn these unhappy little Cells were Ladies under a Course of Tor∣ment a Fury always holding before their Eyes a Picture of their departed Beauty I took Notice of  One  whose Picture repre∣sented the smoothest Satten Skin with the finest Tincture imaginable while the blub∣bering Original was melting away in Tears with Cheeks swell'd into Carbuncles and spotted over with purple Pimples Another whose Portrait display'd a Loveliness almost Angelical was staring on it with bloodshot Eyes and a Face so distorted with Convul∣sions that she look'd methought more frightful than the  Fury  that attended herI begg'd of CAUTION to let me retreat from this melancholy Mansion because it fill'd me with more Horror than I was able to support to see the Effects of such seeming Pleasantry producing Despair and real Mi∣sery and such alluring Beauty betray'd in∣to such hideous and frightful Deformity  CAUTION was so obliging as to grant my Petition in Part but told me That as I must carry  Warning  with me when I return'd to the upper Regions she was under a Ne∣cessity of conducting me to several other Pla∣ces This made it impossible for me to ha∣sten out of my Dream and will not I hope expose me to the Censure which we old Peo∣ple sometimes lie under of being  tedious  in our  Storytelling  and talking rather by  Rule  than by  Measure  In short I find I must  Dream on  'till I come to the End of my next Paper  The Plain Dealer No  Tollite Barbarum  Morem Verecundumque Bacchum  Sanguineis prohibete rixis  HOR  MONDAY  April    The  VISION  continued  I WAS as much deceiv'd in the next Place that Old Mother CAUTION convey'd me to as I had been in the lastA mag∣nificent  Square  open'd to my View whose  four Sides were form'd by the finest Architec∣ture Those Stately Palaces my Guide told me were inhabited by Persons of the high∣est Rank and Fortune and who were reck∣oned to have the most  delicate  Taste of  Living  She carry'd me into one that appear'd the noblest in the Quadrangle and there from a Window towards the Garden which is situ∣ated on an Eminence that borders on deli∣cious Fields and commands an opening Ex∣tent of Country she shew'd me by the Help of a Prospective Glass a Dozen fair  ManorTowns  all surrounded by a pleasant Variety of Hills and Dales Plains and Woods Green Meadows and Corn Fields richly waving with a promis'd Harvest Gardens and sweet  Parterres  with Fish Ponds and Canals that glitter'd thro' the Trees All which she said was but a small Portion of the Earth en∣joy'd by this Son of Fortune who was Ma∣ster of that fine Palace we stood inThis House had been it seems every Day in the Afternoon and every Night and all the Night long crowded from Top to Bottom with People of all Sexes Ages and Coun∣tries who provided they had the Merit of  wanting nothing  were welcome to partake of all the Abundance of this Place where no∣thing appear'd but what was noble and delightful The Earth from Pole to Pole was ransack'd as were the  Air  and  Water  to supply this House with Delicacies  BUT the Owner who gloried in his Hospi∣tality without esteeming any one of his Guests but in proportion as he profess'd an Admira∣tion of this Ostentatious Magnificence of Living valued himself most upon the Va∣riety of his tasteful  Wines  which Merchants from all Quarters of the World were Hour∣ly emptying in upon him They were distin∣guish'd by such different Names that it would require as much  Study  as would make a  Scho∣lar  in any other Science to Register and do Justice to their  Titles Colours Tastes  and the happy Places which produc'd them Dif∣ferent Companies in every Apartment had their  Signals  and  gave Fire  together and by their Number it was reckon'd That every  leading Glass  that was turn'd up by the gay  Master  pour'd out about a  Tun  includ∣ing Servants Computations by way of  Per∣quisite  and  Emolument  CAUTION at the  Sound  of every  Health  bid me view the Manors from the Garden Window and I perceiv'd a Man in a Black Gown presenting a Roll of Parchment to another who was a Jolly kind of Fellow and  Steward  it seems to the Landlord arm'd with a  Letter  of  Attorney  to sign what Deeds he should  find necessary  No sooner was this Parchment return'd to the Man in Black but immediately the Prospect shorten'd by the Length of one whole Vil∣lage which vanishing from our Sight left us no other Land Mark where it stood but  a vast and fruitful  Crab Tree  The Healths went round so frequently and so merrily that the Villages and ManorTowns disappear'd like Mists in a Sunny Morning till at last the Gentleman in Black with a Train of frightful Monsters at his Heels en∣ter'd fiercely the  MansionHouse  whence all the Company ran hastily away and the louder the Master call'd after them so much the faster they continued running  AS soon as we were got into the  Square  alas  fuit Ilium  I mean the Spot where the Square  had stood  all the Palaces were vanish'd and turn'd methought into an  Orchard  of  CrabTrees  With whose Fruit a Croud of  fine Gentlemen  who were running away in their Shirts were pelted without Mercy by red  Furies  to whose  Favourites  a Number of  Vintners  and  lucky Gamesters  they had but just before transferr'd their  Birthright  IT is impossible to express the Anguish the Despair of these  unlanded  Gentlemen some tore down Branches and accusing one another for the Seduction of ill Example form'd a Battle with dismember'd  CrabTrees  others hang'd themselves among the Boughs at the Approach of illlook'd Ruffi∣ans who surrounded them in their New  Orchard  THE next was an Assembly of Men of  Wit  consisting of a  Poet  an  Orator  a  Phi∣losopher  a  Mathematician  a  Divine  a  Mili∣tary  Officer  the  fine Gentleman  who enter∣tain'd them all and an  Eunnch  who sung in the  Opera  The  Poet  recited a  Hymn  to  Bacchus  of his own ComposingThe  Orator  with great Gracefulness harangu'd upon the Force of  Eloquence  which he at∣tributed to the Warmth of  Wine  The  Philosopher  set  Cato  's  Virtue  before them as held  steady  by the  Strength  of  Drinking  The  Divine  averr'd That  Solomon  said  Wine made the Face of a Man to  SHINE and prov'd it very  soberly  by shewing its  Effects  upon his own  illuminated  CountenanceThe  Mathematician  produc'd a  Pun  and said He lov'd a full  Gage  because it was the  Perfection  of  Measure  And to mea∣sure exactly was the  Duty  of his ProsessionThe  Officer  commended  Wine  as a great Inflamer of  Courage  and quoted a  Dutch  Author in Defence of the Use of  Drinking  in Times of  War  And the faith∣ful Service of  Auxillary Brandy  The  fine Gentleman  expatiated on the Advantage to be reap'd by entertaining such polite Com∣pany when assembled over a  Bottle  and ordered the  Fury  that attended them to put round the Glass At which the  Eunuch  began to  sing  and the whole Company clap∣ped their Hands and roar'd out  Encore  and  Bravo  NO sooner had the Glass gone round but the  Orator  propos'd  Method  to be the Foun∣dation of  Argument  and insisted that All  should talk in their  Turns  which as soon as any began to do he broke in upon his own Rule and gallop'd with a bawling Voice through  Divisions  and  Subdivisions  'till he had  disunited  the whole CompanyThe  Poet  thought he had equal Right to the Use of his Tongue and rose to assert it in an exorbitant Manner just as he found he had lost the Use of itThe  Philo∣sopher  cried out in vain That Men must labour to subdue their Passions and to con∣vince them how easy it was fell into so  vio∣lent  a one himself that he knock'd down the poor  Poet  with a Club called  Argumen∣tum Baccilinum  For says he there is no  other  Way of  disputing  against those who deny  first Principles  The  Divine  seeing a  Philosopher  turn  Murderer  and talk at the same Time of  Principles  thunder'd out  Ana∣thema  's against  Disputing at all  where the Business they met for was  Drinking  The  Mathematician  was muttering  Problems  and tracing out a  Globe  upon the Table with his  Fingers  dipt in the  Liquor  that the Scufflers had  spilt  upon it and the  finebred Gentleman  to assist the Depth of his important Designs was pouring more Wine to that which was spilt already lest he might want a Supply of Liquor But just as the Figure was upon the Point of being finished the Officer swore it made  dull Company  and rubb'd it out with his Sleeve The  Mathematician  seeing his  Globe defac'd  cried The  World was at an  End  to which the  Philosopher  and  Divine  agreeing and the rest of the Company deny∣ing it they fell all together by the Ears and squeezed the  Eunuch  to Death while he was trying the Influence of his  Musick  against  Madness  WHEN the Fury was just going to re∣store them to their Senses again that they might perform over the same Exercise which they do it seems every Hour just as strange Sights are shewn in Fairs or as Drunken Men renew their waking Debauches after a little Interval of Sleep in their Life∣times I left them with a pungent Regret that there should be in Liquor such a Power of turning  Strength  into  Weakness Health  into  Sickness Beauty  into  Deformity Riches  into  Poverty Friendship  into  Murder Wis∣dom  into  Folly  and  Wit  into  Madness  I WAK'D with no small Wonder at this sleeping Ramble of my Imagination But turning over a Collection of Old NewsPa∣pers bound up in Volumes from the  Resto∣ration  gradually downward I found them fill'd with Yearly Proofs that Men act the very same Follies  waking  in this World that I had been Dreaming were done in the other  THERE I found Accounts of Men of great Estates dead in a Prison from the Effects of DrinkingQuarrels every jot as fantastical as any I have been describingThere were Accounts of Men casting Lots  in their Liquor which should be  hang'd  and which the  Hangman  Here were fine Histories of others who in a ridicu∣lous Bravado had drank the Health of the  Devil  in a Punchbowl season'd with  Opium  and launch'd down while the Humour was on 'em to pay a Visit to their grateful PatronI look'd back as far as the Time when certain wild Beasts called  Mo∣hocks  had broke loose here in  London  and I found that it was no new Thing for Generals and Common Soldiers Lords Watchmen and Drawers Counts Coblers and HackneyCoachmen to engage in  no unequal  Matches together and fight with all the  Triumph  of  Drunkenness  nay what is more I found all this as duly  repeated here  as I dreamt it to be in the Lower Regions  WHILE I was thus poring over my News Papers and reflecting that the  Life  of  Man  tallied exactly as to its Extravagance with the Dreams of his disorder'd  Fancy  I heard a Noise in the Street as if all  Barbican  were in an Uproar and looking out of my Window I saw Men with gil∣ded Staves and an Air of exerted Magistra∣cy knocking down a Set of roaring little  Heroes  with  Leeks  in their HatsIn∣quiring into the Matter I was told by an ArchWag smiling as if he derided my Ignorance That it was nothing but a few  Welshmen  who were got  Loyally  Drunk  and did sober People a Mischief in Honour of the good Saint their  Patron  I RESOLV'D then as extravagant as my Thoughts seem'd to me before and per∣fectly  remov'd  out of Nature to pen them down since I found such Persons did  really exist  as I had believ'd Imagination could only  shadow  in the preposterous Inconsi∣stence of a DreamIt may thought I be of  Use  to shew Men who are ad∣dicted to this Vice their Pictures plac'd in the fullest Point of Absurdity And since most of them take  Hell  to be a  Dream  it is natural enough to expect that a  Dream  of  Hell  may divert them  The Plain Dealer N  o    Pulvis Umbra sumus  HOR  FRIDAY  April    AMONG a numberless Variety of  Si∣militudes  by which the Different Wits of Poets Satirists Philosophers and Divines have endeavour'd to express the Shortness and Insignificance of Humane Life I am most pleas'd with that of  Lucian  where he compares it to those little Bubbles which are made by a Shower of Rain that falls upon some Lake or River where they are bro∣ken as fast as they are form'd and give way to others that immediately follow them  THERE is in this Comparison the  Empti∣ness  the  Smoke  and the  Bustle  as well as the  Weakness  and  Brevity  of Life It is me∣thinks a very mortifying Picture of that  Step half stridden  That  SportingField of Fortune  which St  Augustin  has so compre∣hensively explain'd himself upon when he says  "It is a Life ebbing with Doubts flowing with Hopes and beaten by Mise∣ries  puff'd up with Luxury and made lean by Abstinence Distracted by Wishes sharpen'd by Cares and blunted by Indo∣lence arrogant in Youth peevish in Age restless in Health and impatient in Sick∣ness And at last so overclouded by  Death  that  Ceasing to be  one would think  It never was  I WAS insensibly attracted to this Subject by my Perusal of Three  Epitaphs  widely different in their Designs For the First ex∣cites  Humility  in HighLife The Second ad∣vises  Retirement  and The Third inflames to  Glory  THAT which recommends Humility to the Possessors of Power and Dignity is the Trans∣lation of a  Latin  Inscription on the Monu∣ment of a Duke of  Brunswick  in the Cathe∣dral Church of that City  Here Great and Good  Duke HENRY  buried lies  O'er their dead  Founder  these proud Arches rise  His pious  Consort  too the  Poor  's safe Guide  Mix'd with his  Dust  clings  closer  to his Side  MATILDA  Daughter to Great  England  's King  Whose Virtues spite of  Death  still  bloom  in Spring  King  OTHO  too their Son here shares their Rest  By both fond Parents Arms again possess'd  And hereO Grief of Beauty near him lies  The  Charmer  of his  Heart  and all Mens  Eyes  That lovely Form whose Smiles  inflam'd Desire  Here Food for Worms can no  soft Woes  inspire  Thou Passenger whose Eyes this  Marble  view  Learn to be  Wise  nor  fleeting  Hopes pursue  Life is an Evening Breeze a murm'ring Breath  That blows till  Sunset  then grows  calm  in Death  THE Second  Epitaph  which recommends as I said a  retir'd Life  is that of  Similis  a Military Officer of great Experience in the Time of the Emperor  Adrian  who obtain'd Leave with no small Difficulty to retire at last into the Country and living there but  Seven Years  in a quiet and peaceful Privacy enjoyed more solid Satisfaction than he had ever reap'd before from all his long Life spent in Hurry Danger and Distinction So that coming at last to  die  he appointed by his  Will  this  Epitaph  Shou'd Curious Readers wish to know  Whose Dust their Feet are pressing  SIMILIS  fam'd in War lies low  His Country's Boast and Blessing  Long did he Toil and Grasp and Strive  Yet  lost  his  Time  he fears  For tho' till  SeventySix ALIVE  He  LIV'd  but  Seven  short Years  THE Third  Epitaph  to give it at once the highest praise which  can  be given it is wor∣thy its illustrious Subject the Great CZAR of RUSSIA It was sent me by a Gentle∣man to whose Hands it came in  Latin  But  I was so justly charm'd with the Sublimity of the Sentiments that I could not resist the Temptation of giving it to the La∣dies and other  English  Readers in their own native Language because I would have none of them robb'd of the Pleasure which I receiv'd in perusing it  Hic jacent  Reliquiae vix mortales  PETRI ALEXOWITZ  RUSSIARUM IMPERATORIS haud opus est

to another to say what may be necessary in Answer to them  To the Author of the  PLAIN DEALER  SIR  PERCEIVING that it is customa∣ry for you to receive Letters from our Sex I am willing to throw myself into your Protection in Hopes of meeting with a favourable Regard from you and that you may assist me in my Distress  I AM a young Woman of some Fortune and of no mean Extraction and was some Months ago the  Happiest Woman in the World  My Story in short is this There was a young Gentleman every way superior  to myself thought fit to make his Addres∣ses to me At first I concluded from the Inequality of our Fortunes that he did it purely for a little Diversion but by I know not what kind of Infatuation I was soon perswaded to believe he was just and sin∣cere in his Pretensions From hence there sprang an Intimacy between us which last∣ed a considerable Time and which I ne∣ver thought would have a Period 'till Death had separated us for ever But behold the Vicissitudes and Changes of Life the un∣expected Turns of Fortune which no Hu∣mnn Foresight can prevent When I thought myself almost arrived to the highest Perfe∣ction of earthly Happiness  Strephon  the unkind  Strephon  forsook me and bereft me of all my Joys and Hopes at once  IT is to me very surprizing that so intimate a Correspondence which was carried on with so much pretended Satisfaction on his Part shou'd now be so irksome to him as to make him avoid my Company and even the very Sight of me I cannot pretend to penetrate into his  Thoughts  but I am sure his  Actions  always carried in them the Marks of a real and unfeigned Passion He seem'd ever studious to  divert  and  please  me and trea∣ted me with a  Civility  and  Respect  which is not common even in the most  passionate Lover  It is now I think two Months since he payed me a Visit nor have I heard from him to let me know the Reason of his  Absence which together with some private Intimations I have had from others gives me sufficient Grounds to believe he is  false  AND is it possible after such an uncom∣mon Behaviour he should abandon nay  despise  the Person he once appear'd so much to admire Are these his Protestations of  eternal Love  Is  this  his  Friendship  Has he so soon forgot his Vows of Constancy and Fidelity  Who  even of the most  Wise  and  Prudent  could have suspected much less discern'd  Deceit  under the fair Appear∣ance of so much seeming  Honour  and  Since∣rity  I was so far from distrusting him whom I thought the  Virtuous  and  Gene∣rous Strephon  that I put my whole Confi∣dence in him and was innocently betray'd by the irresistable Charms of his Eloquence  I HAVE wrote to him several Times since he has left me but either my Let∣ters were intercepted or he is wholly re∣gardless of them for I have not as yet received an Answer nor can I by any Means inform myself what has been the Cause of his unkind Separation For this Reason I take this publick Opportunity both to ask your Advice in so critical a Juncture and to convince him of his dis∣ingenuous Treatment of one for whom he pretended once to have the most unalte∣rable Veneration If you think fit to give this Letter a Place in one of your Papers I know it will come to his Hands and  perhaps such a Memorial under your Au∣thority and Protection may have a greater Influence over him than any common Epi∣stle I desire therefore you will insert it and oblige your most humble Servant  DELIA  Pray correct it before it is Printed  To the  PLAIN DEALER  SIR  IT is a common Observation That Trees that  Blossom soonest  are liable to be soonest Frost nipt As if Nature by ob∣serving the full Growth of such forward Virtues mistook the Progress of Years and measured  Maturity  not by  Age  but by  Character  I MOURN the Misery Mr PLAIN DEALER of having lately lost a  Friend  whose Picture I will present you with as it is drawn to the Life in my Memory  IN Business there was a  Pleasure  always triumphing over his Hurry such a Suavity and Complacence in his Behaviour as at∣tracted the  Heart  before the  Head  could have Time to  weigh  him He was subser∣vient to no Passion but  Love  which made him a Friend to all Mankind nor could those narrow Limits of Soul which con∣tract Mens  Friendships  to their  Interests  re∣strain  his boundless Generosity which made him  Every Body's  who had  Miseries  with∣in the Compass of his Easing He had so feverish a  Thirst  of  Obliging  that an Enemy would have call'd his Liberality rather his  Disease  than his  Ornament  He sought for no Reward but the  Prosperity  of those he favour'd and if at any Time it was not in his Power to  grant  he was more asham'd and unsatisfied than the Person whom he disappointed and by way of Atonement injoined himself the Penance of  watching  for some  happier  Opportunity when he cou'd meet the Wish above half way and prevent its Explanation  NOR did this Benevolence of his Nature extend only to those within the Sphere of his Acquaintance whoseever Misfortunes came to his Knowledge made an equal and noble ImpressionFor he  impro∣priated  all Mens Griefs till he had lessen'd them by  Comforts  IF there were any so Ungenerous as to make him their  Enemy  he was as willing to forgive as they to offer the InjuryJudge then how happy must those few have been who were blest with his Inti∣macy Whatever Tenderness is conceived in Nature from Mothers to their newborn Infants may deserve to pass as some faint Image of his SweetnessHis Faith and his Friendships were as lasting as his  Life  was  WITH all these Advantages never had Man an humbler Opinion of himself which was an Armor that defended him against the  Flattery  of Fortune as his Stea∣diness despis'd her  Malice  To  Him  to be  High  or  Low  were Accidents merely indif∣ferent The one cou'd neither exalt nor cou'd the other depress his Sentiments And had Heaven thought fit to have ex∣empted his Body like his Mind from In∣firmities He had been as well  Immortal  as  Inestimable  The fashionable Vanities which allure and captivate young Hearts could never get Admittance into his masculine and discerning Bosom always guarded by Reason and Virtue He renounc'd in the Pride of his Youth those Enjoyments which others content themselves with disclaiming when the Power of possessing them is either lost or abated Oh I am left in a  Desart  without this Guide that my fond Soul hung upon And nothing remains but the Influence of his  Example  that can be worth the Wish of any Man who had the Bles∣sing to be acquainted with him  IN Justice to his Memory allow this little Specimen of my departed Friend a Place in one of your Papers and you will much oblige  Your Constant Reader And WellWisher  NED MOURNFULL  To the Worshipful Master  PLAIN DEALER  SIR  I HAVE had such an Overmind to see you that I came to Town on purpose being a Kind of  Plain Dealer  myself For tho'f I am a Country Fellow and no  La∣tin  Scollard yet I reckon myself the wisest in our whole Parish except mayhap the Parson And he is so churlish that one dare not  deal plainly  with him I believe you to be no proud Man and that made me so bold as to come to seek you out being in hopes to have told our Parson that I had conversed in my Time with as  Learned  a Man as he  GOOD Master PLAIN DEALER be so kind as to tell a Body in your next Paper where you may be sound and rather than lose the Sight of so goodnatur'd an old Man I will come once more on purpose tho'f I shou'd have no other Business When I enquired after you I thought I shou'd ne'er have found you out but then at last I was told by a very young Man that you was to be met with at the  Tower  of  Barbican  Z'lids I was never so so glad in all my Lifetime but soon after I found I had nothing to be glad on and I doubt the Rogue put the  CityBite  upon me for I have searched every Crick and Corner to find out such a  Tower  and could  get no News of it  Barbican  I did find and the  Tower  I did find but I cou'd find no  Tower  of  Barbican  I have worn out two Shooes by the Bargain that were as good as any two Pair I can get hereabouts Pray if there be any such  Tower  and you live in it I beseech you to order Matters so that I may come to find it out  I READ your Papers and understand them as well as most other Folks all but your  Top Sentences  which are generally so hard that they puzzle all our Parish The best Scollards of us put our Heads toge∣ther to find out their Meaning and when we can't agree about it we go to consult our Parson and I am sorry to say it he pro∣nounces a hard Judgment upon themHe does not think it  worth his Trouble  he says to  understand  Heathen  Authors  be∣cause those Men were seldom good  Chri∣stians  But this shall not prevent my Reading your Papers for I have a better Opinion of you than to think so prophane∣ly of any of your Friends and Acquain∣tance Being in overgreat Haste for the Country have but just Time to put you in mind of me and wishing you in good Health as I am at this present Writing blessed be God for it remain  Worshipful SIR  Your very Sincere Friend  George Gardener  The Plain Dealer No  Pro captu Lectoris habent sua fata Libelli  MONDAY  May    To the Author of the  PLAIN DEALER  SIR  TURNING over the Works of  Shakespear  lately usher'd into the World by an extravagant Subscription and finding the Six Volumes tho' called  Shake∣spear  's Works contained not his VENUS and ADONIS his TARQUIN and LU∣CRECE and numberless other Miscellane∣ous Pieces which for Richness of Fancy and the many beautiful Descriptions that adorn them are far from being inferior to some of his more celebrated Labours I thought my self obliged to become a Pur∣chaser of the Seventh Volume also which appears to me to have no Demerit to oc∣casion its Exclusion  YOU Mr PLAIN DEALER whose Lucubrations are so justly admir'd by all good Judges of Wit and Taste will in∣dulge me the Transcription of a few of those numberless natural Beauties which shine every where thro' these charming Pieces and the rather because I have been in∣form'd That this Volume which is so necessary and essential a Part of the Works of that inimitable Author has not by some of the Wits in  LeadingStrings  been look'd upon with equal Favour because this Edition of it was not midwif'd into the World by the  great Names  that have condescended for the  Emolument  of the  Publick  to shine in the Title Page of the First Six Volumes But as this may take up more Room than you will have to spare in one Paper I shall now and then occasionally beg Leave by your Means to recommend to the  Implicite Witlings  of the Age those Beauties which might otherwise escape their Observation  AND as it is impossible where ever I open the Book not to be surprized with the Beauties of this great Genius I will pre∣sent your Readers with the first that offer'd it self the Exclamation the violated  Lucrece  makes upon OPPORTUNITY and

Amends  One  poor  retiring Minute  in an  Age  Would purchase Thee a  thousand thousand  Friends  Lending him  Wit  that to  bad Debtors  lends  O this dread Night would'st Thou  one Hour  come back  I could prevent this  Storm  and shun this  Wrack  WITH this admirable Flow of Fancy and lively Imagery does this unbounded Genius forgetful indeed of her unfit Condition for Oratory whom he represents as thus Co∣pious while he is forciby carried away by the Stream of his own charming Imagina∣tion I shall only mention That the De∣scription the Poet gives of her Rising to the Morn her Last Will her Parley with her Maid the Maid's sympathizing Beha∣viour  and his admirable Description of the Groom she sent to  Collatine  are Beau∣ties in their Way that have no Equal but in the same Author But I cannot forbear recommending his Description of the Picture he makes the unhappy Lady turn her Eyes to of  Troy  beleagur'd by the  Greeks  to avenge the Rape of  Hellen  which for Strength of Description surpas∣ses any Thing of the like Kind and shews the Excellency of the  Poet  's Art above that of the  Painter  as the  Soul  is to the  Body  since 'tis impossible the Pencil of the latter can come up to what follows  A thousand lamentable Objects there  In  Scorn  of  Nature Art  gave  lifeless Life  Many a dire  Drop  seem'd a  Weeping Tear  Shed for the  slaughter'd Husband  by the  Wife  The red Blood  reek'd  to shew the  Painter's Strife  And  dying Eyes  gleam'd forth their  ashy Lights  Like  dying Coals  burnt out in  tedious Nights  There might you see the  labouring Pioneer  Begrim'd  with  Sweat  and  smeared  all with  Dust  And from the Tow'rs of  Troy  there would ap∣pear  The  very Eyes  of  Men  thro'  Loopholes  thrust  Gazing upon the  Greeks  with  little Lust  Such sweet Observance in this Work was had  That one might see those  faroff Eyes  look  sad  In great Commanders  Grace  and  Majesty  You might behold triumphing in their  Faces  In  Youth Quick bearing  and  Dexterity  And here and there the  Painter  interlaces  Pale Cowards  marching on with  trembling Paces  Which  heartless Peasants  did so well resemble  That one wou'd swear He  saw  them  quake  and tremble  In AJAX and ULYSSES O what Art  Of  Physiognomy  might one behold  The  Face  of  either  cypher'd  either  's  Heart    Their  Face  their  Manners  most expresly told  In AJAX's Eyes  blunt Rage  and  Rigor  roll'd  But the  mild Glance  that she ULYSSES lent  Shew'd  deep Regard  and  smiling Government  There pleading might you see grave NESTOR stand  As 'twere  incouraging  the  Greeks  to fight  Making such  sober Actions  with his  Hand  That it beguil'd  Attention  charm'd the  Sight  In  Speech  it seem'd his  Beard  all  Silver white  Wagg'd up and down and from his  Lips  did fly  Thin winding  Breath  which  purl'd up to  the the Sky  About him were a Press of  gaping Faces  Which seem'd to  swallow up  his  sound Advice  All  jointly  list'ning but with  several  Graces  As if some  Syren  did their  Ears  intice  Some  high  some  low  the Painter was so nice  The  Scalps  of many almost hid behind  To  jump up  higher seem'd to  mock  the  Mind  Here  one  Man's Hand lean'd on  another  's Head  His Nose  being shadow'd by his  Neighbour  's  Ear    Here  one  being  throng'd  bears back all  swoln  and  red    Another  smother'd  seems to  pelt  and  swear    And in their Rage such  Signs  of  Rage  they bear  As but for Loss of NESTOR's golden Words  It seems they would debate with angry Swords  For much  imaginary  Work was there  Conceit deceitful so  compact  so  kind  That for ACHILLES'  Image  stood his  Spear  Grip'd in an  armed Hand  himself behind  Was left  unseen  save in the  Eye of Mind  A  Hand  a  Foot  a  Face  a  Leg  a  Head  Stood for the  Whole  to be imagined  And from the Walls of strong besieged  Troy  When their brave Hope bold  Hector  march'd to Field  Stood many  Trojan Mothers  sharing  Joy  To see their  youthful Sons  bright Weapons wield  And to their  Hope  they such  odd Action  yield  That thro' their  light Joy  seemed to appear  Like  bright  Things  stain'd  a kind of  heavy Fear  I SHOULD transcribe the whole Piece were I to give all the Beauties of this admirable Performance I shall only add That the Description of HECUBA and that of the deceitful SINON and the different Passions and Reflections of LUCRETIA on viewing the different Figures are such Masterpieces that they leave us without Words to express the Wonder they inspire at the Force of that Genius whose Production and Glory they are Your Paper Mr  Plain Dealer  crowded as it generally is with Beauties will not be disgrac'd by these Quotations so that I have nothing by way of Apology to say but only to assure you That I am  Your constant Reader and Admirer  R S  The Plain Dealer N  o    Pendent Opera interrupta  VIRG  FRIDAY  May    I AM sorry after so kind a Reception as has been given to my Speculations that any Necessity shou'd arise for my parting a little precipitately with my goodnatur'd Readers But  Love  however fashionable it is among sage Writers to call it a  Weakness  is well known to act with a  Strength  that is irresistable And I need not inform Those who have perus'd me long or with any to∣lerable Degree of Attention that  Patty Amble  holds an Influence over me that is too hard for all my Gravity and breaks like a But∣terfly thro' my Cobweb Resolutions  NO longer ago than Yesterday Morning there was nothing farther from my Thoughts than the Discontinuance of my Weekly La∣bours  But about an Hour before Dinner all my Purposes received new Colours and I am now no longer what I  was  before this short Billet metamorphos'd me  Dear Slavy  AT length I have determin'd to be  only yours  for ever and in Gratitude for all those scarce deserv'd fine Things your Letter of last Week oblig'd me with I will say after you next  Saturday  Morn∣ing whatever Words you wish most ardently to hear me answer inBut this is abso∣lutely upon  Condition  that you put an End immediately to your  PlainDealing  It is the most odious Quality you have and you know I could never bear itI have given you perhaps too short a Warning but you must do as well as you can For pray Hea∣ven I hold in the Mind if you take me not in the present Humour of  Your  Mistress  one Day more And then alas your Servant  MARTHA AMBLE  IT would be unreasonable for any of my  Christian  Readers to expect a better Excuse than This for my taking Leave of them so abruptlyIt is possible however that  when our  first Hurry of Business  is a little over I may have Leisure more than enough to  talk on  as I have done hitherto But un∣der what  Name  or  Shape  I shall make my Appearance is a Matter I am wholly  dark  inThis only I am sure of and agree heartily with  Her  in That it must be any Thing rather than a  Plain Dealer  the Aver∣sion if I am not mistaken of every  Wife  in Christendom  BUT to soften as much as possible the Abruptness of my Departure it may not be amiss to spend a little Conversation upon those agreeable Correspondents and indulgent Readers which in the Course of this Work I have met with Next to the Pleasure of do∣ing Good the greatest is to meet with Appro∣bation and Assistance in our Attempts towards it This has been my Happiness and I hope it cannot be attributed to any reproachable Weakness when I confess I feel a Pang at part∣ing with it Barely to acknowledge amounts to Gratitude in those People whom Fortune does not enable to return a Benefit that is at present my Case My approaching Fate will allow me to make no better a Payment than Thanks which therefore I desire may be candidly accepted  WHEN I had written thus far an Acquain∣tance whom in some of the preceding Dis∣courses I have recommended to the publick for a Pertness of Conceit and Flippancy of Tongue happened to come into my Room  and taking up the Paper ran it hastily over then throwing it down with a petulant Sneer and a brisk Voice cry'd out  "Foregad con∣sidering your Sentiments and Circum∣stances grave Sir I can't help comparing you to a Criminal taking leave of the ByeStanders with Tears in his Eyes before his ExecutionFaith I long to see thee turn'd off thoul't make the prettiest Fi∣gure of a  Dangler  ha ha"  Then changing his Allegory continued his Im∣pertinence thus  "Matrimony my good Friend is a long and tiresome Journey and the worst Road that ever you travell'd inYou seem uneasy but sure you can∣not in Conscience be displeased that I should take up  PlainDealing  just where you left it offIf you are to make you Amends I promise never to imitate you in any Thing particularly your last Resolution of com∣mitting that dreadful Sin of MatrimonyBelieve me Friend the Man that signs Marriage Articles gives it under his Hand that he's a Fool"  TO this I answered very gravely That before I left off  Plain Dealing  absolutely I was resolved to give him one Lesson which might be of use to him in his Practice  "You are to remember continued I that he who gives Advice should always take Care to do it in such a Manner that his Advice may not appear to be an Insult upon the Character or Understanding of the Person  advised  Good Breeding  embellishes  Good Sense  and  True Politeness  is no more than  civiliz'd Plain Dealing  "  BUT to pass by this volatile Spark who if I divine aright will in every respect act like a modern fine Gentleman that is continue a Batchelor till Sixty to shew his  Wit  and then marry his HouseKeeper to shew his  Judgment  let me return to the Conversa∣tion which he interrupted tho' I must take so much Notice of his Opinion that I pro∣mise my Readers if ever I appear again in Publick I shall amply and impartially con∣sider it by which Time perhaps my own Observations and Experience will better en∣able me to make a clear and satisfactory Com∣ment upon it  FAREWELL then Gentle Readers be happy as I am shortly to be I have on my part endeavour'd to please and you on yours have shewn some Regard for my Endeavours Till I can again attend you I wish you heartily a more agreeable Instructor but think not my persuading you to  good Humour  at Part∣ing an Inconsistence in my Character for tho' I always abhorr'd Flattery yet I never thought Truth the worse for being agreeably dress'd The common Forms of Civility tho' they are often the Disguises of Insincerity are no Disgrace to an honest Heart and a good In∣tention Where they are made use of to  conceal  our Sentiments they are wicked and abomi∣nable  where only to  adorn  innocent and agree∣able At worst you ought only to consider me as one who without losing his Sincerity is by degrees
