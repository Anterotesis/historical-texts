green fieldslook at the trees and enjoy the pleasure of doing nothingWell down I came" and bought a large estate here to make myself respectedand respected I was"was complimented by being made churchwarden immediately on my arrival and gave a feast to the parish"the parson declared I spoke monstrous well at the vestry and liked my company so well that he has  dined  with me three or four times a weekall my letters came directed to Robert Bootekin Esquireand the member for the county shook me by the hand last election when he came round to  canvas  "Nay Sir Charles Courtly came down from London t'other day to dine with me and apologize for not paying two hundred pounds he owes me"Now I call  this  being respected  Stately  You  may call it so Mr Bootekinyou have not much idea of respectHe He  HeI don't mean to offend youbut give me leave to explain to youit is my opinion  Bootekin  Zounds my dear friend when you were in the law did you give opinions before the  case  was  stated  I was going to tell you that since this Irish woman has set it about the town that I'm a vulgar dog egad things begin to changefellows in carters frocks and hobnail'd shoes contradict me at the vestrythe parson had the impudence to  preach  about the badness of my wine at my own tableand egad nobody in the place bow to me now but old women and children and that's only when I give them halfpenceall because forsooth I'm a vulgar fellowZounds how can a man be vulgar with £ in his pocket  Stately  Look ye Mr BootekinI knew you in Londonyou made shoes for me many yearsyou are a wellmeaning man and I have a regard for youbut you have been brought up in a low wayand your ideas are confin'dHe He He "Your arguments are loud and heavy like a  lapstone  dropt in a pondthey make a noise for a moment and then sink in the mudHe He Hesink in the mud"  Bootekin  "First raising circles in the pond which like your roundabout explanations become wider of the mark every moment 'till at last they leave no trace of what occasioned them" He He He  Imitating him  Stately  Mr Bootekin you are ignoramus as we say in the courts and therefore  Bootekin  I beg pardon Mr StatelyI was too warm

find it necessary sometimes to understand your subject  Bob  Not at all SirI am a natural speakernever study but say whatever comes uppermostmy opinion is that a speech is a speech if there are but words enough in itand I am allowed to have the  of saying more in a given time than any speaker in the society  Stately  I suppose you talk faster  Bob  Exactly so SirBut àpropos I can give you a specimen or two of our questionsLet me see where are my memorandumsOh here The questions to be debated as they stand in order on our list are FirstIs war or peace best for this countrywe were favour'd with this question by a  navy agent  and we expect it will produce a warm debateSecond in the list stands the question Whether the lady who has  black blue  or  grey eyes  is likely to make the best wife  Stately  A very instructive and amusing speculation  Bob  Upon Charlotte's first introduction to Werter did not she behave rather ungenteelly in not offering him a dish of tea  Stately  Very material to be ascertained  Bob  The nextno faith the next question was debated last week out of its turn on account of its peculiar importance and at the desire of several respectable members  Stately  What may that be  Bob  Is the tinker the taylor or the lamplighter the most useful member of society  Stately  "And how might it have been determined"  Bob  "Why Siras our advertisement in the newspapers next day very properly statedthis  question gave rise to a most important and interesting debate in which instruction was mingled with amusementThe arguments were from time to time enliven'd by the most brilliant flashes of wit and humour from several gentlemen of the firstrate abilities who honour'd the question with their attentionby the bye  I  was prodigiously great that nightwith their attentionBut the variety of material points which presented for discussion protracting the debate to an unusual length and the friends of the lamplighter  I  supported himthe friends of the lamplighter wishing for an opportunity of answering the arguments of their opponents the debate was adjourned till next week"  Stately  And pray young Mr Bootekin do you never touch on politics  Bob  Oh yes Sirpolitics are my fortewe had a most glorious debate the other dayWhether some great men ought not to lose their heads for not doing somethingbut egad I forget whathowever I supported the question and beat Dick Dab hollow though he sported a dozen Latin mottos which he stole from the Spectators and Tatlers the day beforeI sat down amidst a thunder of applause from hands feet and sticksin short the minister totter'dwhen within ten minutes of the debate closing in came a posse of treasuryrunners as we suspect who by dint of coughing laughing and hooting put a stop to the debatea battle ensued between two ladiesthe  moderator  flew into a  violent passion  constables were sent forand the debate ended  Stately  As most political disputes endneither party giving up the pointWell I must go  and pay a few visits to some of my old acquaintanceand  Bootekin  You'll be back time enough for our Readingswhat d' ye think of Bobis not his conversation vastly amusing  Stately
