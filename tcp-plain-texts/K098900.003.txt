 THE LUCUBRATIONS OF  Isaac Bickerstaff  Esq  Revised and Corrected by the Author  VOL III  Homer  LONDON  Printed by  John Nutt  and sold by  John Mor∣phew  near  StationersHall  MDCCXII  TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE  WILLIAM Lord Cowper  Baron of  WINGHAM  My Lord  AFTER having long ce∣lebrated the superiour Graces and Excellencies among Men in an Ima∣ginary Character I do my self the  Honour to show my Veneration for transcendent Merit under my own Name in this Address to your Lord∣ship The just Application of those high Accomplishments of which you are Master has been an Ad∣vantage to all your Fellow Subjects and it is from the common Obli∣gation you have laid upon all the World that I though a private Man can pretend to be affected with or take the Liberty to ac∣knowledge your great Talents and publick Virtues  It gives a pleasing Prospect to your Friends that is to say to the Friends of your Country that you have passed through the Highest Offices at an Age when others usually do but form to themselves the Hopes of them They may expect to see you in the House of Lords as many Years as you were ascending to it It is our common  Good that your admirable Elo∣quence can now no longer be employed but in the Expression of your own Sentiments and Judg∣ment The skilful Pleader is now for ever chang'd into the just Judge which latter Character your Lord∣ship exerts with so prevailing an Impartiality that you win the Ap∣probation even of those who dissent from you and you always obtain Favour because you are never mo∣ved by it  This gives you a certain Dignity peculiar to your present Situation and makes the Equity even of a Lord High Chancellor appear but a Degree towards the Mag∣nanimity of a Peer of  Great Bri∣tain  Forgive me My Lord when I cannot conceal from you that I shall never hereafter behold you  but I shall behold you as lately defending the Brave and the Un∣fortunate  When we attend to your Lord∣ship engaged in a Discourse we cannot but reflect upon the many Requisites which the vainglorious Speakers of Antiquity have deman∣ded in a Man who is to excel in Oratory I say My Lord when we reflect upon the Precepts by viewing the Example though there is no Excellence proposed by those Rhetoricians wanting the whole Art seems to be resolved into that one Motive of Speaking Sincerity in the Intention The graceful Manner the apt Gesture and the assumed Concern are impotent Helps to Persuasion in Compari∣son of the honest Countenance of him who utters what he really means From hence it is that all the Beauties which others at∣tain  with Labour are in your Lord∣ship but the natural Effects of the Heart that dictates  It is this noble Simplicity which makes you surpass Mankind in the Faculties wherein Mankind are di∣stinguished from other Creatures Reason and Speech  If these Gifts were communi∣cated to all Men in Proportion to the Truth and Ardour of their Hearts I should speak of you with the same Force as you express your self on any other Subject But I resist my present Impulse as agreeable as it is to me though indeed had I any Pretensions to a Fame of this Kind I should above all other Themes attempt a Pane∣gyrick upon My Lord  Cowper  For the only sure Way to a Reputation for Eloquence in an Age where∣in that perfect Orator lives is to  chuse an Argument upon which he himself must of Necessity be silent I am  My LORD  Your Lordship's Most Devoted Most Obedient and Most Humble Servant  Richard Steele  THE N  o  TATLER  BY Isaac Bickerstaff  Esq  VOL III  Novum intervenit Vitium Calamitas  Ut neque spectari neque cognosci potnerit  It a Populus Studio stupidus in Funambulo  Animum occupârat  Ter de Hecyra  From  Saturday Dec  to  Tuesday Jan    SheerLane  January  I Went on  Friday  last to the Opera and was surprised to find a thin House at so noble an Entertainment till I heard that the Tumbler was not to make his Appearance that Night For my own Part I was fully satisfied with the Sight of an Actor who by the Grace and Propriety of his Action and Gesture does Honour to an hu∣mane Figure as much as the other vilifies and degrades it Every one will easily imagine I mean Signior  Nicolini  who sets off the Character he bears in an Opera by his Action as much as he does the Words of it by his Voice Every Limb and every Finger contributes to the Part  he acts insomuch that a deaf Man might go a long with him in the Sense of it There is scarce a beautiful Posture in an old Statue which he does not plant himself in as the different Cir∣cumstances of the Story give Occasion for it He performs the most ordinary Action in a Manner suitable to the Greatness of his Character and shows the Prince even in the giving of a Letter or the dispatching of a Message Our best Actors are somewhat at a Loss to support themselves with proper Gesture as they move from any con∣siderable Distance to the Front of the Stage but I have seen the Person of whom I am now speak∣ing eater alone at the remotest Part of it and advance from it with such Greatness of Air and Meen as seemed to fill the Stage and at the same Time commanded the Attention of the Au∣dience with the Majesty of his Appearance But notwithstanding the Dignity and Elegance of this Entertainment I find for some Nights past that  Punchinello  has robbed this Gentleman of the greater Part of his Female Spectators The Truth of it is I find it so very hard a Task to keep that Sex under any Manner of Government that I have often resolved to give them over intirely and leave them to their own Inventions I was in Hopes that I had brought them to some Or∣der and was employing my Thoughts on the Reformation of their Petticoats when on a sud∣den I received Information from all Parts that they run gadding after a PuppetShow I know very well that what I here say will be thought by some malicious Persons to flow from Envy to Mr  Powell  for which Reason I shall set the late Dispute between us in a true Light Mr  Powell  and I had some Difference about Four Months ago which we managed by way of Letter as learned Men ought to do and I was very well contented to bear such Sarcasms as he was pleased to throw upon me and answered them with the  same Freedom In the midst of this our Misun∣derstanding and Correspondence I happened to give the World an Account of the Order of  Esquires  upon which Mr  Powell  was so disinge∣nuous as to make one of his Puppets I wish I know which of them it was declare by way of Prologue That one  Isaac Bickerstaff  a Pretended  Esquire  had wrote a scurrilous Piece to the Dis∣honour of that Rank of Men and then with more Art than Honesty concluded that all the  Esquires  in the Pit were abused by his Antago∣nist as much as he was This publick Accusa∣tion made all the  Esquires  of that County and several of other Parts my professed Enemies I do not in the least question but that he will pro∣ceed in his Hostilities and I am informed That Part of his Design in coming up to Town was to carry the War into my own Quarters I do therefore solemnly declare notwithstanding that I am a great Lover of Art and Ingenuity that if I hear he opens any of his People's Mouths a∣gainst me I shall not fail to write a Critick up∣on his whole Performance for I must confess that I have naturally so strong a Desire of Praise that I cannot bear Reproach tho' from a Piece of Timber As for  Punch  who takes all Opportu∣nities of bespattering me I know very well his Original and have been assured by the Joyner who put him together that he was in long Dis∣pute with himself whether he should turn him into several Pegs and Utensils or make him the Man he is The same Person confessed to me that he had once actually laid aside his Head for a Nutcracker As for his Scolding Wife how∣ever she may value her self at present it is very well known that she is but a Piece of Crabtree This Artificer further whispered in my Ear that all his Courtiers and Nobles were taken out of a QuicksetHedge not far from  Islington  and that Dr  Faustus  himself who is now so great a Con∣jurer  is supposed to have learned his whole Art from an old Woman in that Neighbourhood whom he long served in the Figure of a Broom∣staff  But perhaps it may look trivial to insist so much upon Men's Persons I shall therefore turn my Thoughts rather to examine their Behaviour and consider whether the several Parts are writ∣ten up to that Character which Mr  Powell  piques himself upon of an able and judicious Drama∣tist I have for this Purpose provided my self with the Works of above Twenty  French  Criticks and shall examine by the Rules which they have laid down upon the Art of the Stage whe∣ther the Unity of Time Place and Action be rightly observed in any one of this celebrated Author's Productions as also whether in the Parts of his several Actors and that of  Punch  in Particular there is not sometimes an Impropriety of Sentiments and an Impurity of Diction  White's Chocolatehouse  Jan  I came in here to Day at an Hour when only the Dead appear in Places of Resort and Gallan∣try and saw hung up the Escutcheon of Sir  Han∣nibal  a Gentleman who used to frequent this Place and was taken up and interred by the Company of Upholders as having been seen here at an unlicensed Hour The Coat of the Deceased is Three Bowls and a Jack in a green Field the Crest a DiceBox with the King of Clubs and Pam for Supporters Some Days ago the Body was carried out of Town with great Pomp and Ceremony in order to be buried with his Ancestors at the  Peak  It is a Maxim in Mo∣rality That we are to speak nothing but Truth of the Living nothing but Good of the Dead As I have carefully observed the first during his Lifetime I shall acquit my self as to the latter now he is deceased  He was Knighted very young not in the ordi∣nary Form but by the common Consent of Man∣kind  He was in his Person between round and square in the Motion and Gesture of his Body he was unaffected and free as not having too great a Respect for Superiors He was in his Discourse bold and intrepid and as every one has an Excellence as well as a Failing which di∣stinguishes him from other Men Eloquence was his predominant Quality which he had to so great a Perfection that it was easier to him to speak than to hold his Tongue This sometimes exposed him to the Derision of Men who had much less Parts than himself And indeed his great Volubility and inimitable Manner of Speak∣ing as well as the great Courage he shewed on those Occasions did sometimes betray him into that Figure of Speech which is commonly distin∣guish'd by the Name of Gasconade To men∣tion no other he professed in this very Place some few Days before he died That he would be One of the Six that would undertake to as∣sault me for which Reason I have had his Figure upon my Wall till the Hour of his Death And am resolved for the future to bury every one forthwith who I hear has an Intention to kill me  Since I am upon the Subject of my Adversaries I shall here publish a short Letter which I have received from a Wellwisher and is as follows  Sage SIR  YOU cannot but know there are many Scribblers and others who revile you and your Writings It is wondered that you do not exert your self and crush them at once  I am  SIR  With great Respect Your most humble Admirer and Disciple  In Answer to this I shall act like my Prede∣cessor  Aesop  and give him a Fable instead of a Reply  It happened one Day as a stout and honest Mastiff that guarded the Village where he lived against Thieves and Robbers was very gravely walking with one of his Puppies by his Side all the little Dogs in the Street gather'd about him and barked at him The little Puppy was so of∣fended at this Affront done to his Sire that he asked him Why he would not fall upon them and tear them to Pieces To which the Sire an∣swered with a great Composure of Mind  If there were no Curs I should be no Mastiff  The TATLER N  o    Pars minima est ipsa Puella  ui  Ovid  From  Tuesday Jan  to  Thursday Jan    Sheerlane  January  THE Court being prepared for proceeding on the Cause of the Petticoat I gave Orders to bring in a Criminal who was taken up as she went out of the PuppetShow about Three Nights ago and was now standing in the Street with a great Concourse of People about her Word was brought me that she had endeavoured twice or thrice to come in but could not do it by reason of her Petticoat which was too large for the Entrance of my House tho' I had ordered both the FoldingDoors to be thrown open for its Re∣ception Upon this I desired the Jury of Ma∣trons who stood at my Right Hand to inform themselves of her Condition and know whether  there were any private Reasons why she might not make her Appearance separate from her Pet∣ticoat This was managed with great Discretion and had such an Effect that upon the Return of the Verdict from the Bench of Matrons I issued out an Order forthwith That the Criminal should be stripped of her Incumbrances till she became little enough to enter my House I had before given Directions for an Engine of several Legs that could contract or open it self like the Top of an Umbrello in order to place the Pet∣ticoat upon it by which Means I might take a leisurely Survey of it as it should appear in its proper Dimensions This was all done accord∣ingly and forthwith upon the closing of the Engine the Petticoat was brought into Court I then directed the Machine to be set upon the Table and dilated in such a Manner as to show the Garment in its utmost Circumference but my great Hall was too narrow for the Experi∣ment for before it was half unfolded it descri∣bed so immoderate a Circle that the lower Part of it brush'd upon my Face as I sate in my Chair of Judicature I then enquired for the Person that belonged to the Petticoat and to my great Surprize was directed to a very beautiful young Damsel with so pretty a Face and Shape that I bid her come out of the Crowd and seated her upon a little Crock at my Left Hand My pret∣ty Maid said I do you own your self to have been the Inhabitant of the Garment before us The Girl I found had good Sense and told me with a Smile That notwithstanding it was her own Petticoat she should be very glad to see an Example made of it and that she wore it for no other Reason but that she had a Mind to look as big and burly as other Persons of her Quality That she had kept out of it as long as she could and till she began to appear little in the Eyes of all her Acquaintance That if she  laid it aside People would think she was not made like other Women I always give great Allowances to the Fair Sex upon Account of the Fashion and therefore was not displeased with the Defence of my pretty Criminal I then or∣dered the Vest which stood before us to be drawn up by a Pully to the Top of my great Hall and afterwards to be spread open by the Engine it was placed upon in such a Manner that it formed a very splendid and ample Canopy over our Heads and covered the whole Court of Ju∣dicature with a kind of Silken Rotunda in its Form not unlike the Cupolo of St  Paul  's I enter'd upon the whole Cause with great Satis∣faction as I sate under the Shadow of it  The Council for the Petticoat was now called in and ordered to produce what they had to say against the popular Cry which was raised against it They answered the Objections with great Strength and Solidity of Argument and expatiated in very florid Harangues which they did not fail to set off and furbelow if I may be allowed the Metaphor with many Periodical Sentences and Turns of Oratory The chief Arguments for their Client were taken first from the great Be∣nefit that might arise to our Woollen Manufactu∣ry from this Invention which was calculated as follows The common Petticoat has not above Four Yards in the Circumference whereas this over our Heads had more in the Semidiameter so that by allowing it Twenty four Yards in the Circumference the Five Millions of Woollen Petticoats which according to Sir  William Pet∣ty  supposing what ought to be supposed in a well∣governed State that all Petticoats are made of that Stuff would amount to Thirty Millions of those of the ancient Mode A prodigious Im∣provement of the Woollen Trade and what could not fail to fink the Power of  France  in a few Years  To introduce the Second Argument they beg∣ged Leave to read a Petition of the RopeMakers wherein it was represented That the Demand for Cords and the Price of them were much risen since this Fashion came up At this all the Company who were present lifted up their Eyes into the Vault and I must confess we did disco∣ver many Traces of Cordage which were inter∣woven in the Stiffening of the Drapery  A Third Argument was founded upon a Peti∣tion of the  Greenland  Trade which likewise re∣presented the great Consumption of Whalebone which would be occasioned by the present Fashion and the Benefit which would thereby accrue to that Branch of the  British  Trade  To conclude they gently touched upon the Weight and Unweildiness of the Garment which they insinuated might be of great Use to preserve the Honour of Families  These Arguments would have wrought very much upon me as I then told the Company in a long and elaborate Discourse had I not conside∣red the great and additional Expence which such Fashions would bring upon Fathers and Husbands and therefore by no Means to be thought of till some Years after a Peace I further urged that it would be a Prejudice to the Ladies themselves who could never expect to have any Money in the Pocket if they laid out so much on the Petticoat To this I added the great Temptation it might give to Virgins of acting in Security like mar∣ried Women and by that Means give a Check to Matrimony an Institution always encouraged by wise Societies  At the same Time in Answer to the several Petitions produced on that Side I shewed one subscribed by the Women of several Persons of Quality humbly setting forth That since the In∣troduction of this Mode their respective Ladies had instead of bestowing on them their CastGowns  cut them into Shreds and mixed them with the Cordage and Buckram to compleat the Stiffening of their UnderPetticoats For which and sundry other Reasons I pronounced the Pet∣ticoat a Forfeiture But to shew that I did not make that Judgment for the Sake of filthy Lucre I ordered it to be folded up and sent it as a Pre∣sent to a WidowGentlewoman who has five Daughters desiring she would make each of them a Petticoat out of it and send me back the Remainder which I design to cut into Stoma∣chers Caps Facings of my WastcoatSleeves and other Garnitures suitable to my Age and Quality  I would not be understood that while I discard this monstrous Invention I am an Enemy to the proper Ornaments of the Fair Sex On the con∣trary as the Hand of Nature has poured on them such a Profusion of Charms and Graces and sent them into the World more amiable and finished than the rest of her Works so I would have them bestow upon themselves all the additional Beauties that Art can supply them with provided it does not interfere with disguise or pervert those of Nature  I consider Woman as a beautiful Romantick Animal that may be adorned with Furs and Fea∣thers Pearls and Diamonds Ores and Silks The Lynx shall cast its Skin at her Feet to make her a Tippet the Peacock Parrat and Swan shall pay Contributions to her Muff the Sea shall be searched for Shells and the Rocks for Gems and every Part of Nature furnish out its Share towards the Embellishment of a Creature that is the most consummate Work of it All this I shall indulge them in but as for the Petti∣coat I have been speaking of I neither can nor will allow it  The TATLER N  o    Durate vosmot Rebus servate secundis  Virg  From  Thursday Jan  to  Saturday Jan    SheerLane  January  WHen I look into the Frame and Consti∣tution of my own Mind there is no Part of it which I observe with greater Satis∣faction than that Tenderness and Concern which it bears for the Good and Happiness of Mankind My own Circumstances are indeed so narrow and scanty that I should tast but very little Plea∣sure could I receive it only from those Enjoy∣ments which are in my own Possession but by this great Tincture of Humanity which I find in all my Thoughts and Reflections I am happier than any single Person can be with all the Wealth Strength Beauty and Success that can be conferred upon a Mortal if he only relishes such a Proportion of these Blessings as is vested in himself and is his own private Property By this Means every Man that does himself any real Service does me a Kindness I come in for my Share in all the Good that happens to a Man of Merit and Virtue and partake of many Gifts of Fortune and Power that I was never born to There is nothing in particular in which I so much rejoice as the Deliverance of good and ge∣nerous Spirits out of Dangers Difficulties and Distresses And because the World does not sup∣ply Instances of this Kind to furnish out sufficient Entertainments for such an Humanity and Bene∣volence of Temper I have ever delighted in  reading the History of Ages past which draws together into a narrow Compass the great Oc∣currences and Events that are but thinly sown in those Tracts of Time which lie within our ownKnowledge and Observation When I see the Life of a great Man who has deserved well of his Country after having struggled through all the Oppositions of Prejudice and Envy break∣ing out with Lustre and shining forth in all the Splendor of Success I close my Book and am an happy Man for a whole Evening  But since in History Events are of a mixed Nature and often happen alike to the Worthless and the Deserving insomuch that we frequently see a virtuous Man dying in the Midst of Disap∣pointments and Calamities and the Vicious end∣ing their Days in Prosperity and Peace I love to amuse my self with the Accounts I meet with in fabulous Histories and Factions For in this Kind of Writings we have always the Pleasure of seeing Vice punished and Virtue rewarded In∣deed were we able to view a Man in the whole Circle of his Existence we should have the Sa∣tisfaction of seeing it close with Happiness or Misery according to its proper Merit But tho' our View of him is interrupted by Death before the finishing of his Adventures if I may so speak we may be sure that the Conclusion and Catastrophe is altogether suitable to his Beha∣viour On the contrary the whole Being of a Man consider'd as an Hero or a KnightEr∣rant is comprehended within the Limits of a Poem or Romance and therefore always ends to our Satisfaction so that Inventions of this Kind are like Food and Exercise to a goodnatured Dis∣position which they please and gratifie at the same Time that they nourish and strengthen The greater the Affliction is in which we see our Favourites in these Relations engaged the greater is the Pleasure we take in seeing them relieved  Among the many feigned Histories which I have met with in my Reading there is none in which the Hero's Perplexity is greater and the winding out of it more difficult than that in a  French  Author whose Name I have forgot It so happens that the Hero's Mistress was the Sister of his most intimate Friend who for certain Reasons was given out to be dead while he was preparing  o leave his Country in Quest of Adventures The Hero having heard of his Friend's Death immediately repaired to his Mi∣stress to condole with her and comfort her Upon his Arrival in her Garden he discover'd at a Distance a Man clasped in her Arms and em∣braced with the most endearing Tenderness What should he do It did not consist with the Gentleness of a KnightErrant either to kill his Mistress or the Man whom she was pleased to favour At the same Time it would have spoiled a Romance should he have laid violent Hands on himself In short he immediately entered upon his Adventures and after a long Series of Exploits found out by Degrees that the Person he saw in his Mistress's Arms was her own Bro∣ther taking Leave of her before he left his Country and the Embrace she gave him nothing else but the affectionate Farewel of a Sister So that he had at once the Two greatest Satis∣factions that could enter into the Heart of Man in finding his Friend alive whom he thought dead and his Mistress faithful whom he had believed inconstant  There are indeed some Disasters so very fatal that it is impossible for any Accidents to rectifie them Of this Kind was that of poor  Lucretia  and yet we see  Ovid  has found an Expedient even in this Case He describes a Beautiful and Royal Virgin walking on the Seashore where she was discovered by  Neptune  and violated after a long and unsuccessful Importunity To miti∣gate  her Sorrow he offers her whatever she would wish for Never certainly was the Wit of Woman more puzzled in finding out a Strata∣gem to retrieve her Honour Had she desired to be changed into a Stock or Stone a Beast Fish or Fowl she would have been a Loser by it Or had she desired to have been made a SeaNymph or a Goddess her Immortality would but have perpetuated her Disgrace Give me therefore said she such a Shape as may make me incapable of suffering again the like Calamity or of being reproached for what I have already suffered To be short she was turned into a Man and by that only Means avoided the Danger and Imputation she so much dreaded  I was once my self in Agonies of Grief that are unutterable and in so great a Distraction of Mind that I thought my self even out of the Possibility of receiving Comfort The Occasion was as fol∣lows When I was a Youth in a Part of the Army which was then quartered at  Dover  I fell in Love with an agreeable young Woman of a good Fa∣mily in those Parts and had the Satisfaction of seeing my Addresses kindly received which occa∣sioned the Perplexity I am going to relate  We were in a calm Evening diverting our selves upon the Top of the Cliff with the Prospect of the Sea and trifling away the Time in such little Fond∣nesses as are most ridiculous to People in Business and most agreeable to those in Love  In the Midst of these our innocent Endearments she snatched a Paper of Verses out of my Hand and ran away with them I was following her when on a sudden the Ground tho' at a conside∣rable Distance from the Verge of the Precipice sunk under her and threw her down from so pro∣digious an Height upon such a Range of Rocks as would have dashed her into Ten Thousand Pieces had her Body been made of Adamant It is much easier for my Reader to imagine my State of Mind  upon such an Occasion than for me to express it I said to my self It is not in the Power of Hea∣ven to relieve me When I awaked equally trans∣ported and astonished to see my self drawn out of an Affliction which the very Moment before appeared to me altogether inextricable  The Impressions of Grief and Horrour were so lively on this Occasion that while they lasted they made me more miserable than I was at the real Death of this beloved Person which happened a few Months after at a Time when the Match be∣tween us was concluded inasmuch as the imagi∣nary Death was untimely and I my self in a Sort an Accessary whereas her real Decease had at least these Alleviations of being natural and in∣evitable  The Memory of the Dream I have related still dwells so strongly upon me that I can never read the Description of  DoverCliff  in  Shakespear  's Tragedy of  King Lear  without a fresh Sense of my Escape The Prospect from that Place is drawn with such proper Incidents that whoever can read it without growing giddy must have a good Head or a very bad One  Come on Sir here's the Place stand still How fearful  And dizzy 'tis to cast ones Eyes so low  The Crows and Choughs that wing the Midway Air  Show scarce as gross as Beetles HalfWay down  Hangs one that gathers Samphire Dreadful Trade  Methinks he seems no bigger than his Head  The Fishermen that walk upon the Beach  Appear like Mice and yond' tall anchoring Bark  Diminish'd to'her Boat her Boat a Buoy  Almost too small for Sight The murmuring Surge  That on the unnumber'd idle Pebble beats  Cannot be heard so high I'll look no more  Lest my Brain turn  The TATLER N  o    Lusisti satis edisti satis atque bibisti  Tempus abire tibi  Hor  From  Saturday Jan  to  Tuesday Jan    From my own Apartment  Jan  I Thought to have given over my Prosecution of the Dead for this Season having by me many other Projects for the Reformation of Man∣kind but I have receiv'd so many Complaints from such different Hands that I shall disoblige Multitudes of my Correspondents if I do not take Notice of them Some of the Deceased who I thought had been laid quietly in their Graves are such Hobgoblins in publick Assem∣blies that I must be forc'd to deal with them as  Evander  did with his triplelived Adversary who according to  Virgil  was forced to kill him thrice over before he could dispatch him  Ter Letho sternendus erat  I am likewise informed That several Wives of my Dead Men have since the Decease of their Husbands been seen in many publick Places without Mourning or Regard to common De∣cency  I am further advised That several of the De∣funct contrary to the Woollen Act presume to dress themselves in Lace Embroidery Silks Muslins and other Ornaments forbidden to Per∣sons in their Condition These and other the like Informations moving me thereunto I must de∣sire for DistinctionSake and to conclude this Subject for ever that when any of these Posthu∣mous Persons appear or are spoken of that their  Wives may be call'd Widows their Houses Se∣pulchres their Chariots Hearses and their Gar∣ments Flannel On which Condition they shall be allowed all the Conveniences that Dead Men can in Reason desire  As I was writing this Morning on this Subject I receiv'd the following Letter  From the Banks of  Styx  Mr  Bickerstaff  I Must confess I treated you very scurrilously when you first sent me hither but you have dispatched such Multitudes after me to keep me in Countenance that I am very well recon∣cil'd both to you and my Condition We live very lovingly together for as Death makes us all equal it makes us very much delight in one another's Company Our Time passes away much after the same Manner as it did when we were among you Eating Drinking and Sleep∣ing are our chief Diversions Our  Quid Nunes  between Whiles go to a Coffeehouse where they have several warm Liquors made of the Waters of  Lethe  with very good Poppy Tea We that are the sprightly Genius's of the Place refresh our selves frequently with a Bottle of Mum and tell Stories till we fall asleep You would do well to send among us Mr  Dodwill  's Book against the Immortality of the Soul which would be of great Consolation to our whole Fraternity who would be very glad to find that they are dead for good and all and would in particular make me rest for ever  Yours  John Partridge  P S Sir  James  is just arrived here in good Health  The foregoing Letter was the more pleasing to me because I perceive some little Symptoms in  it of a Resusciation and having lately seen the Predictions of this Author which are written in a true Protestant Spirit of Prophecy and a par∣ticular Zeal against the  French  King I have some Thoughts of sending for him from the Banks of  Styx  and reinstating him in his own House at the Sign of the  Globe  in  Salisburystreet  For the Encouragement of him and others I shall offer to their Consideration a Letter which gives me an Account of the Revival of one of their Bre∣thren  Dec  SIR  I Have perused your  Tatler  of this Day and have wept over it with great Pleasure I wish you would be more frequent in your Fa∣milyPieces For as I consider you under the Notion of a great Designer I think these are not your least valuable Performances I am glad to find you have given over your Face∣painting for some Time because I think you have employed your self more in Grotesque Fi∣gures than in Beauties for which Reason I would rather see you work upon HistoryPieces that on single Portraicts Your several Draughts of Dead Men appear to me as Pictures of StillLife and have done great Good in the Place where I live The 'Squire of a neighbouring Village who had been a long Time in the Number of NonEntities is entirely recovered by them For these several Years past there was not an Hare in the County that could be at Rest for him and I think the greatest Ex∣ploit he ever boasted of was That when he was HighSheriff of the County he hunted a Fox so far that he could not follow him any further by the Laws of the Land All the Hours he spent at Home were in swelling him∣self with  October  and rehearsing the Wonders he did in the Field Upon reading your Papers  he has sold his Dogs shook off his dead Com∣panions looked into his Estate got the Multi∣plicationTable by Heart paid his Tythes and intends to take upon him the Office of Church∣warden next Year I wish the same Success with your other Patients and am  c  Ditto  January  When I came Home this Evening a very tight middleaged Woman presented to me the follow∣ing Petition  To the Worshipful  Isaac Bickerstaff  Esq  Censor of  Great Britain  The humble Petition of  Penelope Prim  Widow  Sheweth  THat your Petitioner was bred a Clearstar∣cher and Sempstress and for many Years worked to the  Exchange  and to several Alder∣mens Wives Lawyers Clerks and MerchantsApprentices  That through the Scarcity caused by Regra∣ters of BreadCorn of which Starch is made and the Gentries immoderate frequenting the Opera's the Ladies to save Charges have their Heads washed at Home and the Beaus put out their Linen to common Landresses So that your Petitioner hath little or no Work at her Trade For Want of which she is re∣duced to such Necessity That she and her Se∣ven Fatherless Children must inevitably perish unless relieved by your Worship  That your Petitioner is informed That in Contempt of your Judgment pronounced on  Tuesday  the d Instant against the newfashion∣ed Petticoat or oldfashioned Fardingal the Ladies design to go on in that Dress And since it is presumed your Worship will not sup∣press them by Force your Petitioner humbly  desires you would order That Ruffs may be added to the Dress and that she may be heard by her Council who has assured your Petitioner he has such cogent Reasons to offer to your Court that Ruffs and Fardingals are in∣separable and that he questions not but Two Thirds of the greatest Beauties about Town will have Cambrick Collars on their Necks be∣fore the End of  Easter  Term next He further says That the Design of our Great Grandmo∣thers in this Petticoat was to appear much bigger than the Life for which Reason they had false ShoulderBlades like Wings and the Ruff abovemention'd to make their upper and lower Parts of their Bodies appear propor∣tionable whereas the Figure of a Woman in the present Dress bears as he calls it the Figure of a Cone which as he advises is the same with that of an Extinguisher with a little Knob at the upper End and widening down∣ward till it ends in a Basis of a most enormous Circumference  Your Petitioner therefore most humbly prays That you would restore the Ruff to the Far∣dingal which in their Nature ought to be as inseparable as the Two  Hungarian  Twins  And your Petitioner shall ever pray  I have examined into the Allegations of this Petition and find by several ancient Pictures of my own Predecessors particularly that of Dame  Deborah Bickerstaff  my Great Grandmother that the Ruff and Fardingal are made Use of as abso∣lutely necessary to preserve the Symmetry of the Figure and Mrs  Pyramid Bickerstaff  her second Sister is recorded in our FamilyBook with some Observations to her Disadvantage as the first Fe∣male of our House that discovered to any

obliged to wear the Days of that Place  The TATLER N  o    In Tenui Labor  Virg  From  Tuesday Jan  to  Thursday Jan    SheerLane  January  I Have lately applied my self with much Sa∣tisfaction to the curious Discoveries that have been made by the Help of Microscopes as they are related by Authors of our own and other Na∣tions There is a great deal of Pleasure in pry∣ing into this World of Wonders which Nature has laid out of Sight and seems industrious to conceal from us Philosophy had ranged over all the visible Creation and began to want Objects for her Enquiries when the present Age by the Invention of Glasses opened a new and inex∣haustible Magazine of Rarities more wonderful and amazing than any of those which astonished our Forefathers I was Yesterday amusing my self with Speculations of this Kind and re∣flecting upon Myriads of Animals that swim in  those little Seas of Juice that are contained in the several Vessels of an Humane Body While my Mind was thus filled with that secret Wonder and Delight I could not but look upon my self as in an Act of Devotion and am very well pleased with the Thought of the great Heathen Anato∣mist who calls his Description of the Parts of an Humane Body  An Hymn to the Supreme Be∣ing  The Reading of the Day produced in my Imagination an agreeable Morning's Dream if I may call it such for I am still in Doubt whe∣ther it passed in my sleeping or waking Thoughts However it was I fancied that my good Genius stood at my Bed's Head and entertained me with the following Discourse for upon my Rising it dwelt so strongly upon me that I writ down the Substance of it if not the very Words  If said he you can be so transported with those Productions of Nature which are disco∣vered to you by those artificial Eyes that are the Works of Humane Invention how great will your Surprize be when you shall have it in your Power to model your own Eye as you please and adapt it to the Bulk of Objects which with all these Helps are by infinite Degrees too minute for your Perception We who are unbodied Spi∣rits can sharpen our Sight to what Degree we think fit and make the least Work of the Crea∣tion distinct and visible This gives us such Idea's as cannot possibly enter into your present Con∣ceptions There is not the least Particle of Mat∣ter which may not furnish one of us sufficient Employment for a whole Eternity We can still divide it and still open it and still discover new Wonders of Providence as we look into the dif∣ferent Texture of its Parts and meet with Beds of vegetables Mineral and Metallick Mixtures and several Kinds of Animals that lie hid and as it were lost in such an endless Fund of Mat∣ter I find you are surprized at this Discourse  but as your Reason tells you there are infinite Parts in the smallest Portion of Matter it will likewise convince you that there is as great a Variety of Secrets and as much Room for Dis∣coveries in a Particle no bigger than the Point of a Pin as in the Globe of the whole Earth Your Microscopes bring to Sight Shoals of living Creatures in a Spoonful of Vinegar but we who can distinguish them in their different Magni∣tudes see among them several huge  Leviathans  that terrify the little Fry of Animals about them and take their Pastime as in an Ocean or the great Deep I could not but smile at this Part of his Relation and told him I doubted not but he could give me the History of several Invisible Giants accompanied with their respective Dwarfs in case that any of these little Beings are of an humane Shape You may assure your self said he that we see in these little Animals different Natures Instincts and Modes of Life which cor∣respond to what you observe in Creatures of bigger Dimensions We descry Millions of Spe∣cies subsisted on a green Leaf which your Glas∣ses represent only in Crowds and Swarms What appears to your Eye but as Hair or Down rising on the Surface of it we find to be Woods and Forrests inhabited by Beasts of Prey that are as dreadful in those their little Haunts as Lyons and Tygers in the Deserts of  Libya  I was much de∣lighted with his Discourse and could not forbear telling him That I should be wonderfully pleased to see a natural History of Imperceptibles con∣taining a true Account of such Vegetables and Animals as grow and live out of Sight Such Disquisitions answered he are very suitable to reasonable Creatures and you may be sure there are many curious Spirits amongst us who employ themselves in such Amusements For as our Hands and all our Senses may be formed to what Degree of Strength and Delicacy we  please in the same Manner as our Sight we can make what Experiments we are inclin'd to how small soever the Matter be in which we make them I have been present at the Dissection of a Mite and have seen the Skeleton of a Flea I have been shown a Forrest of numberless Trees which has been pick'd out of an Acorn Your Microscope can show you in it a compleat Oak in Miniature and could you suit all your Organs as we do you might pluck an Acorn from this lit∣tle Oak which contains another Tree and so proceed from Tree to Tree as long as you would think fit to continue your Disquisitions It is al∣most impossible added he to talk of Things so remote from common Life and the ordinary No∣tions which Mankind receive from blunt and gross Organs of Sense without appearing extra∣vagant and ridiculous You have often seen a Dog open'd to observe the Circulation of the Blood or make any other useful Enquiry and yet would be tempted to laugh if I should tell you that a Circle of much greater Philosophers than any of the Royal Society were present at the cutting up of one of those little Animals which we find in the Blue of a Plumb That it was ty'd down alive before them and that they observed the Palpitations of the Heart the Course of the Blood the Working of the Muscles and the Convulsions in the several Limbs with great Accuracy and Improvement I must confess said I for my own Part I go along with you in all your Discoveries with great Pleasure but it is certain they are too fine for the Gross of Mankind who are more struck with the De∣scription of every Thing that is great and bulky Accordingly we find the best Judge of humane Nature setting forth his Wisdom not in the For∣mation of these minute Animals tho' indeed no less wonderful than the other but in that of the  Leviathan  and  Behemoth  the  Horse  and the  Crocodile  Your Observation said he is very just and I must acknowledge for my own Part that although it is with much Delight that I see the Traces of Providence in these Instances I still take greater Pleasure in considering the Works of the Creation in their Immensity than in their Mi∣nuteness For this Reason I rejoice when I strengthen my Sight so as to make it pierce into the most remote Spaces and take a View of those Heavenly Bodies which lie out of the Reach of Humane Eyes though assisted by Telescopes What you look upon as one confused White in the MilkyWay appears to me a long Tract of Heavens distinguish'd by Stars that are ranged in proper Figures and Constellations While you are admiring the Sky in a Starry Night I am en∣tertained with a Variety of Worlds and Suns pla∣ced one above another and rising up to such an immense Distance that no created Eye can see an End of them  The latter Part of his Discourse flung me in∣to such an Astonishment that he had been silent for some Time before I took Notice of it when on a sudden I started up and drew my Curtains to look if any one was near me but saw no Body and cannot tell to this Moment whether it was my good Genius or a Dream that left me  The TATLER N  o    Velut Silvis ubi passim  Palantes Error certo de Tramite pellit  Ille sinistrorsum hic dextrorsum abit  Hor  From  Thursd Jan  to  Saturd Jan    SheerLane  January  INstead of considering any particular Passion o  Character in any one Set of Men my Thought  were last Night employed on the Contemplatio  of Humane Life in general and truly it appear  to me that the whole Species are hurried on by the same Desires and engaged in the same Pur∣suits according to the different Stages and Divi¦sions of Life Youth is devoted to Lust middl  Age to Ambition old Age to Avarice Thes  are the Three general Motives and Principles o  Action both in good and bad Men though i  must be acknowledged that they change thei  Names and refine their Natures according t  the Temper of the Person whom they direct an  animate For with the Good Lust becomes Vir¦tuous Love Ambition True Honour and Ava¦rice the Care of Posterity This Scheme o  Thought amused me very agreeably till I retire  to Rest and afterwards formed it self into  pleasing and regular Vision which I shall describ  in all its Circumstances as the Objects presente  themselves whether in a serious or ridiculou  Manner  I dreamed that I was in a Wood of so prodi¦gious an Extent and cut into such a Variety o  Walks and Allies that all Mankind were lost an  bewildered in it After having wandered up an  down some Time I came into the Centre of it which opened into a wide Plain that was filled with Multitudes of both Sexes I here discovered Three great Roads very wide and long that led into Three different Parts of the Forrest On a sudden the whole Multitude broke into Three Parts according to their different Ages and mar∣ched in their respective Bodies into the Three great Roads that lay before them As I had a Mind to know how each of these Roads termi∣nated and whether it would lead those who pas∣sed through them I joined my self with the As∣sembly that were in the Flower and Vigour of their Age and called themselves  The Band of Lovers  I found to my great Surprise that seve∣ral old Men besides my self had intruded into this agreeable Company as I had before ob∣served there were some young Men who had united themselves to the Band of Misers and were walking up the Path of Avarice tho' both made a very ridiculous Figure and were as much laughed at by those they joined as by those they forsook The Walk which we marched up for Thickness of Shades Embroidery of Flowers and Melody of Birds with the distant Purling of Streams and Falls of Water was so wonderfully delightful that it charmed our Senses and in∣toxicated our Minds with Pleasure We had not been long here before every Man singled out some Woman to whom he offered his Addresses and professed himself a Lover when on a sud∣den we perceived this delicious Walk to grow more narrow as we advanced in it till it ended in many intricate Thickets Mazes and Laby∣rinths that were so mixed with Roses and Bram∣bles Brakes of Thorns and Beds of Flowers rocky Paths and pleasing Grotto's that it was hard to say whether it gave greater Delight or Perplexity to those who travelled in it  It was here that the Lovers began to be eager in their Pursuits Some of their Mistresses who only seemed to retire for the Sake of Form and Decency led them into Plantations that were dis∣posed into regular Walks where after they had wheeled about in some Turns and Windings they suffered themselves to be overtaken and gave their Hands to those who pursued them O∣thers withdrew from their Followers into little Wildernesses where there were so many Paths interwoven with each other in so much Confusion and Irregularity that several of the Lovers quit∣ted the Pursuit or broke their Hearts in the Chace It was sometimes very odd to see a Man pursuing a fine Woman that was following ano∣ther whose Eye was fixed upon a Fourth that had her own Game in View in some other Quar∣ter of the Wilderness I could not but observe Two Things in this Place which I thought very particular That several Persons who stood only at the End of the Avenues and cast a careless Eye upon the Nymphs during their whole Flight often catched them when those who pressed them the most warmly through all their Turns and Doubles were wholly unsuccessful And that some of my own Age who were at first look'd upon with Aversion and Contempt by being well acquainted with the Wilderness and by dodging their Women in the particular Corners and Allies of it catched them in their Arms and took them from those whom they really loved and admired There was a particular Grove which was called  The Labyrinth of Coquets  where many were en∣ticed to the Chase but few returned with Pur∣chase It was pleasant enough to see a celebra∣ted Beauty by smiling upon one casting a Glance upon another beckoning to a third and adapt∣ing her Charms and Graces to the several Follies of those that admired her drawing into the La∣byrinth a whole Pack of Lovers that lost them∣selves  in the Maze and never could find their Way out of it However it was some Satis∣faction to me to see many of the Fair Ones who had thus deluded their Followers and left them among the Intricacies of the Labyrinth obliged when they came out of it to surrender to the first Partner that offer'd himself I now had crossed over all the difficult and perplexed Passages that seemed to bound our Walk when on the other Side of them I saw the same great Road running on a little Way till it was terminated by two beautiful Temples I stood here for some Time and saw most of the Multitude who had been dis∣persed amongst the Thickets coming out Two by Two and marching up in Parts towards the Tem∣ples that stood before us The Structure on the Right Hand was as I afterwards found conse∣crated to Virtuous Love and could not be entered but by such as received a Ring or some other Token from a Person who was placed as a Guard at the Gate of it He wore a Garland of Roses and Myrtles on his Head and on his Shoul∣ders a Robe like an Imperial Mantle white and unspotted all over excepting only that where it was clasped at his Breast there were Two golden TurtleDoves that buttoned it by their Bills which were wrought in Rubies He was called by the Name of  Hymen  and was seated near the En∣trance of the Temple in a delicious Bower made up of several Trees that were embraced by Woodbines Jessamines and Amaranths which were as so many Emblems of Marriage and Or∣naments to the Trunks that supported them As I was single and unaccompanied I was not per∣mitted to enter the Temple and for that Reason am a Stranger to all the Mysteries that were per∣formed in it I had however the Curiosity to ob∣serve how the several Couples that entered were disposed of which was after the following Man∣ner There were two great Gates on the Back∣side  of the Edifice at which the whole Crowd was let out At one of these Gates were Two Women extremely beautiful tho' in a different Kind the one having a very careful and compo∣sed Air the other a Sort of Smile and ineffable Sweetness in her Countenance The Name of the first was  Discretion  and of the other  Compla∣cency  All who came out of this Gate and put themselves under the Direction of these two Si∣sters were immediately conducted by them into Gardens Groves and Meadows which abounded in Delights and were furnished with every Thing that could make them the proper Seats of Happi∣ness The Second Gate of this Temple let out all the Couples that were unhappily married who came out linked together by Chains which each of them strove to break but could not Several of these were such as had never been acquainted with each other before they met in the great Walk or had been too well acquainted in the Thicket The Entrance to this Gate was posses∣sed by three Sisters who joined themselves with these Wretches and occasioned most of their Mi∣series The youngest of the Sisters was known by the Name of  Levity  who with the Innocence of a Virgin had the Dress and Behaviour of a Harlot The Name of the Second was  Contention  who bore on her Right Arm a Muff made of the Skin of a Porcupine and on her Left carried a little LapDog that barked and snapped at every one that passed by her  The eldest of the Sisters who seemed to have an haughty and imperious Air was always ac∣companied with a tawny  Cupid  who generally marched before her with a little Mace on his Shoulder the End of which was fashioned into the Horns of a Stag Her Garments were yel∣low and her Complexion pale Her Eyes were piercing but had odd Casts in them and that particular Distemper which makes Persons who  are troubled with it see Objects double Upon Enquiry I was informed that her Name was  Jealousy  Having finished my Observations upon this Temple and its Votaries I repaired to that which stood on the Left Hand and was called  The Tem∣ple of Lust  The Front of it was raised on  Corin∣thian  Pillars with all the meretricious Orna∣ments that accompany that Order whereas that of the other was composed of the chast and ma∣tronlike  Ionic  The Sides of it were adorned with several grotesque Figures of Goats Spar∣rows Heathen Gods Satyrs and Monsters made up of half Man half Beast The Gates were un∣guarded and open to all that had a Mind to en∣ter Upon my going in I found the Windows were blinded and let in only a Kind of Twilight that served to discover a prodigious Number of dark Corners and Apartments into which the whole Temple was divided I was here stunned with a mixed Noise of Clamour and Jollity On one Side of me I heard Singing and Dancing on the other Brawls and Clashing of Swords In short I was so little pleased with the Place that I was going out of it but found I could not return by the Gate where I entered which was barred against all that were come in with Bolts of Iron and Locks of Adamant There was no going back from this Temple through the Paths of Plea∣sure which led to it All who passed thro' the Ce∣remonies of the Place went out at an Iron Wicket which was kept by a dreadful Giant called  Remorse  that held a Scourge of Scorpions in his Hand and drove them into the only Outlet from that Tem∣ple This was a Passage so rugged so uneven and choaked with so many Thorns and Briars that it was a melancholy Spectacle to behold the Pains and Difficulties which both Sexes suffered who walked through it The Men tho' in the Prime of their Youth appeared weak and infee∣bled  with old Age The Women rung their Hands and tore their Hair and several lost their Limbs before they could extricate themselves out of the Perplexities of the Path in which they were engaged The remaining Part of this Vi∣sion and the Adventures I met with in the Two great Roads of Ambition and Avarice must be the Subject of another Paper  ADVERTISEMENT  I have this Morning received the following Letter from the Famous Mr  Thomas Dogget  SIR  ON  Monday  next will be acted for my Benefit the Comedy of  Love for Love  If you will do me the Honour to appear there I will publish on the Bills That it is to be performed at the Request of  Isaac Bickerstaff  Esq  and question not but it will bring me as great an Audience as ever was at the House since the  Morocco  Ambassador was there  I am  With the greatest Respect Your most Obedient and Most Humble Servant  Thomas Dogget  Being naturally an Encourager of Wit as well as bound to it in the Quality of Censor I returned the following Answer  Mr  Dogget  I AM very well pleased with the Choice you have made of so excellent a Play and have always looked upon you as the best of Comedians I shall therefore come in between the First and Second Act and remain in the Right Hand Box over the Pit till the End of the Fourth provided you take Care that every Thing be rightly prepared for my Re∣ception  The TATLER N  o    Similis tibi Cynthia vel tibi cujus  Turbavit nitidos extinctus Passer Ocellos  Juv  From  Saturd Jan  to  Tuesd Jan    From my own Apartment  Jan  I Was recollecting the Remainder of my Vision when my Maid came to me and told me there was a Gentlewoman below who seemed to be in great Trouble and pressed very much to see me When it lay in my Power to remove the Distress of an unhappy Person I thought I should very ill employ my Time in attending Matters of Speculation and therefore desired the Lady would walk in When she entered I saw her Eyes full of Tears However her Grief was not so great as to make her omit Rules for she was very long and exact in her Civilities which gave me Time to view and consider her Her Clothes were very rich but tarnish'd and her Words very fine but illapplied These Distinctions made me with∣out Hesitation tho' I had never seen her before ask'd her If her Lady had any Commands for me She then began to weep afresh and with many broken Sighs told me That their Family was in very great AfflictionI beseeched her to com∣pose her self for that I might possibly be capable of assisting themShe then cast her Eye upon my little Dog and was again transported with too much Passion to proceed but with much ado she at last gave me to understand That  Cupid  her Lady's Lapdog was dangerously ill and in so bad a Condition that her Lady neither saw Company nor went abroad for which Rea∣son  she did not come her self to consult me that as I had mentioned with great Affection my own Dog here she courtsied and looking first at the Cur and then on me said indeed I had Reason for he was very pretty her Lady sent to me ra∣ther than to any other Doctor and hoped I would not laugh at her Sorrow but send her my Ad∣vice I must confess I had some Indignation to find my self treated like something below a Far∣rier yet well knowing that the best as well as most tender Way of dealing with a Woman is to fall in with her Humours and by that Means to let her see the Absurdity of them I proceed∣ed accordingly Pray Madam said I can you give me any methodical Account of this Illness and how  Cupid  was first taken Sir said she we have a little ignorant Country Girl who is kept to tend him She was recommended to our Fa∣mily by one that my Lady never saw but once at a Visit and you know Persons of Quality are always inclined to Strangers for I could have helped her to a Cousin of my own butGood Madam said I you neglect the Account of the sick Body while you are complaining of this Girl No no Sir said she begging your Par∣don But it is the general Fault of Physicians they are so in Haste that they never hear out the Case I say this silly Girl after washing  Cupid  let him stand half an Hour in the Window with∣out his Collar where he catched cold and in an Hour after began to bark very hoarse He had however a pretty good Night and we hoped the Danger was over but for these Two Nights last past neither he nor my Lady have slept a Wink Has he said I taken any Thing No said she but my Lady says he shall take any Thing that you prescribe provided you do not make Use of Jesuits Powder or the Cold Bath Poor  Cupid  continued she has always been Phtisical and as he lies under something like a ChinCough we  are afraid it will end in a Consumption I then asked her if she had brought any of his Water to show me Upon this she stared me in the Face and said I am afraid Mr  Bickerstaff  you are not serious but if you have any Receipt that is proper on this Occasion pray let us have it for my Mistress is not to be comforted Upon this I pansed a little without returning any An∣swer and after some short Silence I proceeded in the following Manner I have considered the Nature of the Distemper and the Constitution of the Patient and by the best Observation that I can make on both I think it is safest to put him into a Course of Kitchin Physick In the mean time to remove his Hoarseness it will be the most natural Way to make  Cupid  his own Drug∣gist for which Reason I shall prescribe to him Three Mornings successively as much Powder as will lie on a Groat of that noble Remedy which the Apothecaries call  Album Graecum  Upon hear∣ing this Advice the young Woman smiled as if she knew how ridiculous an Errand she had been employed in and indeed I found by the Sequel of her Discourse That she was an arch Baggage and of a Character that is frequent enough in Persons of her Employment who are so used to conform themselves in every Thing to the Hu∣mours and Passions of their Mistresses that they sacrifice Superiority of Sense to Superiority of Condition and are insensibly betrayed into the Passions and Prejudices of those whom they serve without giving themselves Leave to consider that they are extravagant and ridiculous However I thought it very natural when her Eyes were thus open to see her give a new Turn to her Discourse and from sympathizing with her Mi∣stress in her Follies to fall a Railing at her You cannot imagine said she Mr  Bickerstaff  what a Life she makes us lead for the Sake of this lit∣tle ugly Cur If he dies we are the most unhap∣py  Family in Town She chanced to lose a Par∣rat last Year which to tell you truly brought me into her Service for she turned off her Wo∣man upon it who had lived with her Ten Years because she neglected to give him Water tho' every one of the Family says she was as innocent of the Bird's Death as the Babe that is unborn Nay she told me this very Morning That if  Cupid  should die she would send the poor inno∣cent Wench I was telling you of to  Bridewell  and have the MilkWoman tried for her Life at the  OldBaily  for putting Water into his Milk In short she talks like any distracted Creature  Since it is so young Woman said I I will by no Means let you offend her by staying on this Message longer than is absolutely necessary and so forced her out  While I am studying to cure those Evils and Distresses that are necessary or natural to Humane Life I find my Task growing upon me since by these accidental Cares and acquired Calamities if I may so call them my Patients contract Di∣stempers to which their Constitution is of it self a Stranger But this is an Evil I have for many Years remarked in the Fair Sex and as they are by Nature very much formed for Affection and Dal∣liance I have observed That when by too obstinate a Cruelty or any other Means they have disap∣pointed themselves of the proper Objects of Love as Husbands or Children such Virgins have ex∣actly at such a Year grown fond of Lapdogs Parrats or other Animals I know at this Time a celebrated Toast whom I allow to be one of the most agreeable of her Sex that in the Pre∣sence of her Admirers will give a Torrent of Kisses to her Cat any one of which a Christian would be glad of I do not at the same Time deny but there are as great Enormities of this Kind committed by our Sex as theirs A  Roman  Emperor had so very great an Esteem for an Horse  of his that he had Thoughts of making him a Consul and several Moderns of that Rank of Men whom we call Country Squires won't scru∣ple to kiss their Hounds before all the World and declare in the Presence of their Wives that they had rather salute a Favourite of the Pack than the finest Woman in  England  These vo∣luntary Friendships between Animals of different Species seem to arise from Instinct for which Reason I have always looked upon the mutual good Will between the 'Squire and the Hound to be of the same Nature with that between the Lion and the Jackall  The only Extravagance of this Kind which ap∣pears to me excusable is one that grew out of an Excess of Gratitude which I have somewhere met with in the Life of a  Turkish  Emperor His Horse had brought him safe out of a Field of Battle and from the Pursuit of a victorious Ene∣my As a Reward for such his good and faithful Service his Master built him a Stable of Marble shod him with Gold fed him in an Ivory Man∣ger and made him a Rack of Silver He an∣nex'd to the Stable several Fields and Meadows Lakes and running Streams At the same time he provided for him a Seraglio of Mares the most beautiful that could be found in the whole  Ottoman  Empire To these were added a suita∣ble Train of Domesticks consisting of Grooms Farriers Rubbers  c  accommodated with pro∣per Liveries and Pensions In short nothing was omitted that could contribute to the Ease and Happiness of his Life who had preserved the Em∣peror's  By reason of the extreme Cold and the Change∣ableness of the Weather I have been prevailed upon to allow the free Use of the Fardingal till the th of  February  next ensuing  The TATLER N  o    Cur in Theatrum Cato severe venisti  Mart  From  Tuesd Jan  to  Thursd Jan    From my own Apartment  Jan  I Find it is thought necessary that I who have taken upon me to censure the Irregularities of the Age should give an Account of my own Actions when they appear doubtful or subject to Misconstruction My appearing at the Play on  Monday  last is looked upon as a Step in my Con∣duct which I ought to explain that others may not be misled by my Example It is true in Mat∣ter of Fact I was present at the ingenious Enter∣tainment of that Day and placed my self in a Box which was prepared for me with great Civi∣lity and Distinction It is said of  Virgil  when he entered a  Roman  Theatre where there were many Thousands of Spectators present That the whole Assembly rose up to do him Honour a Respect which was never before paid to any but the Emperor I must confess That universal Clap and other Testimonies of Applause with which I was received at my first Appearance in the Theatre of  Great Britain  gave me as sensible a Delight as the abovementioned Reception could give to that Immortal Poet I should be ungrateful at the same Time if I did not take this Opportunity of acknowledging the great Ci∣vilities that were shown me by Mr  Thomas Dog∣get  who made his Compliments to me between the Acts after a most ingenuous and discreet Manner and at the same Time communicated to me that the Company of Upholders desired to receive me at their Door at the End of the  Har∣market  and to light me home to my Lodgings That Part of the Ceremony I forbad and took particular Care during the whole Play to observe the Conduct of the  Drama  and give no Offence by my own Behaviour Here I think it will not be foreign to my Character to lay down the pro∣per duties of an Audience and what is incum∣bent upon each individual Spectator in publick Diversions of this Nature Every one should on these Occasions show his Attention Understand∣ing and Virtue I would undertake to find out all the Persons of Sense and Breeding by the Ef∣fect of a single Sentence and to distinguish a Gen∣tleman as much by his Laugh as his Bow When we see the Footman and his Lord diverted by the same Jest it very much turns to the Dimi∣nution of the one or the Honour of the other But tho' a Man's Quality may appear in his Un∣derstanding and Tast the Regard to Virtue ought to be the same in all Ranks and Conditions of Men however they make a Profession of it un∣der the Name of Honour Religion or Morali∣ty When therefore we see any Thing divert an Audience either in Traged or Comedy that strikes at the Duties of Civil Life or exposes what the best Men in all Ages have looked up∣on as sacred and inviolable it is the certain Sign of a prosligate Race of Men who are fallen from the Virtue of their Forefathers and will be contemptible in the Eyes of their Posterity For this Reason I took great Delight in seeing the generous and disinterested Passion of the Lovers in this Comedy which stood so many Trials and was proved by such a Variety of diverting Incidents received with an universal Approba∣tion This brings to my Mind a Passage in  Ci∣cero  which I could never read without being in Love with the Virtue of a  Roman  Audience He there describes the Shouts and Applauses which the People gave to the Persons who acted the  Parts of  Pilades  and  Orestes  in the noblest Oc∣easion that a Poet could invent to show Friend∣ship in Perfection One of them had forfeited his Life by an Action which he had committed and as they stood in Judgment before the Ty∣rant each of them strove who should be the Criminal that he might save the Life of his Friend Amidst the Vehemence of each asserting himself to be the Offender the  Roman  Au∣dience gave a Thunder of Applause and by that Means as the Author hints approved in others what they would have done themselves on the like Occasion Methinks a People of so much Virtue were deservedly placed at the Head of Mankind But alas Pleasures of this Nature are not frequently to be met with on the  English  Stage  The  Athenians  at a Time when they were the most polite as well as the most powerful Go∣vernment in the World made the Care of the Stage one of the chief Parts of the Administra∣tion And I must confess I am astonished at the Spirit of Virtue which appeared in that Peo∣ple upon some Expressions in a Scene of a fa∣mous Tragedy an Account of which we have in one of  Seneca  's Epistles A coverous Person is represented speaking the common Sentiments of all who are possessed with that Vice in the following Soliloquy which I have translated literally  Let me be called a base Man so I am called a rich one If a Man is rich who asks if he is good The Question is How much we have not from whence or by what Means we have it Every one has so much Merit as he has Wealth For my own Part let me be rich Oh ye Gods or let me die The Man dies happily who dies increasing his Trea∣sure There is more Pleasure in the Possession of  Wealth than in that of Parents Children Wife or Friends  The Audience were very much provoked by the first Words of this Speech but when the Actor came to the Close of it they could bear no longer In short the whole Assembly rose up at once in the greatest Fury with a Design to pluck him off the Stage and brand the Work it self with Infamy In the Midst of the Tumult the Author came out from behind the Scenes begging the Audience to be composed for a little while and they should see the Tragical End which this Wretch should come to immediately The Promise of Punishment appeased the People who sat with great Attention and Pleasure to see an Example made of so odious a Criminal It is with shame and Concern that I speak it but I very much question whether it is possible to make a Speech so impious as to raise such a lau∣dable Horror and Indignation in a Modern Au∣dience It is very natural for an Author to make Ostentation of his Reading as it is for an old Man to tell Stories for which Reason I must beg the Reader will excuse me if I for once in∣dulge my self in both these Inclinations We see the Attention Judgment and Virtue of a whole Audience in the foregoing Instances If we would imitate the Behaviour of a single Specta∣tor let us reflect upon that of  Socrates  in a Par∣ticular which gives me as great an Idea of that extraordinary Man as any Circumstance of his Life or what is more of his Death This ve∣nerable Person often frequented the Theatre which brought a great many thither out of a Desire to see him On which Occasion it is re∣corded of him That he sometimes stood to make himself the more conspicuous and to satis∣fy the Curiosity of the Beholders He was one Day present at the first Representation of a Tra∣gedy  of  Euripides  who was his intimate Friend and whom he is said to have assisted in several of his Plays In the Midst of the Tragedy which had met with very great Success there chanc'd to be a Line that seemed to encourage Vice and Immorality  This was no sooner spoken but  Socrates  rose from his Seat and without any Regard to his Affection for his Friend or to the Success of the Play showed himself displeased at what was said and walked out of the Assembly I que∣stion not but the Reader will be curious to know what the Line was that gave this Divine Hea∣then so much Offence If my Memory fails me not it was in the Part of  Hippolitus  who when he is pressed by an Oath which he had taken to keep Silence returned for Answer That he had taken the Oath with his Tongue but not with his Heart Had a Person of a vicious Character made such a Speech it might have been allowed as a proper Representation of the Baseness of his Thoughts But such an Expres∣sion out of the Mouth of the virtuous  Hippolitus  was giving a Sanction to Falshood and establish∣ing Perjury by a Maxim  Having got over all Interruptions I have set apart to Morrow for the closing of my Vision  The TATLER N  o    Audire atque Togam jubeo componere quisquis  Ambitione mala aut Argenti pallet Amore  Hor  From  Thursd Jan  to  Saturd Jan    From my own Apartment  January  A Continuation of the Vision  WITH much Labour and Difficulty I pas∣sed through the first Part of my Vision and recovered the Centre of the Wood from whence I had the Prospect of the Three great Roads I here joined my self to the middleaged Party of Mankind who marched behind the Standard of Ambition The great Road lay in a direct Line and was terminated by the  Temple of Virtue  It was planted on each Side with Lawrels which were intermixed with Marble Trophies Carved Pillars and Statues of Law∣givers Heroes Statesmen Philosophers and Poets The Persons who travelled up this great Path were such whose Thoughts were bent upon doing eminent Services to Mankind or promoting the Good of their Country On each Side of this great Road were several Paths that were also laid out in straight Lines and ran parallel with it These were most of them covered Walks and received into them Men of retired Virtue who proposed to themselves the same End of their Journey tho' they chose to make it in Shade and Obscurity The Edifices at the Extremity of the Walk were so contrived that we could not see the  Temple of Honour  by reason of the  Temple of Virtue  which stood before it  At the Gates of this Temple we were met b  the Goddess of it who conducted us into tha  of Honour  which was joined to the other Edi¦fice by a beautiful Triumphal Arch and had no other Entrance into it When the Deity of the Inner Structure had received us she presented us in a Body to a Figure that was placed over the high Altar and was the Emblem of Eternity She sat on a Globe in the midst of a Golden Zodiac holding the Figure of a Sun in one Hand and a Moon in the other Her Head was veiled and her Feet covered Our Hearts glowed within us as we stood amidst the Sphere of Light which this Image cast on every Side of it  Having seen all that happen'd to this Band of Adventurers I repaired to another Pile of Build∣ing that stood within View of the  Temple of Honour  and was raised in Imitation of it upon the very same Model but at my Approach to it I found that the Stones were laid together without Mortar and that the whole Fabrick stood upon so weak a Foundation that it shook with every Wind that blew This was called the  Temple of Vanity  The Goddess of it sat in the midst of a great many Tapers that burned Day and Night and made her appear much bet∣ter than she would have done in open Daylight Her whole Art was to show her self more beau∣tiful and majestick than she really was For which Reason she had painted her Face and wore a Cluster of false Jewels upon her Breast But what I more particularly observed was the Breadth of her Petticoat which was made alto∣gether in the Fashion of a modern Fardingal This Place was filled with Hypocrites Pedants FreeThinkers and prating Politicians with a Rabble of those who have only Titles to make them great Men Female Votaries crowded the Temple choak'd up the Avenues of it and  were more in Number than the Sand upon the Seashore I made it my Business in my Return towards that Part of the Wood from whence I first set out to observe the Walks which led to this Temple for I met in it several who had be∣gun their Journey with the Band of virtuous Persons and travelled some Time in their Com∣pany But upon Examination I found that there were several Paths which led out of the great Road into the Sides of the Wood and ran into so many crooked Turns and Windings that those who travelled thro' them often turned their Backs upon the  Temple of Virtue  then crossed the straight Road and sometimes marched in it for a little Space till the crooked Path which they were engaged in again led them into the Wood The several Alleys of these Wanderers had their particular Ornaments One of them I could not but take Notice of in the Walk of the mischie∣vous Pretenders to Politicks which had at every Turn the Figure of a Person whom by the Inscription I found to be  Machiavel  pointing out the Way with an extended Finger like a  Mercury  I was now returned in the same Manner as be∣fore with a Design to observe carefully every Thing that passed in the Region of  Avarice  and the Occurrences in that Assembly which was made up of Persons of my own Age This Body of Travellers had not gone far in the Third great Road before it led them insensibly into a deep Valley in which they journied several Days with great Toil and Uneasiness and with∣out the necessary Refreshments of Food and Sleep The only Relief they met with was in a River that ran through the Bottom of the Valley on a Bed of Golden Sand They often drank of this Stream which had such a particular Quality in it that tho' it refreshed them for a Time it  rather inflamed than quenched their Thirst On each Side of the River was a Range of Hills full of precious Ore for where the Rains had wash'd off the Earth one might see in several Parts of them long Viens of Gold and Rocks that looked like pure Silver We were told That the Deity of the Place had forbad any of his Votaries to dig into the Bowels of these Hills or convert the Treasures they contained to any Use under Pain of Starving At the End of the Valley stood  The Temple of Avarice  made after the Manner of a Fortification and surrounded with a thou∣sand trippleheaded Dogs that were placed there to keep off Beggars At our Approach they all fell a Barking and would have very much ter∣rified us had not an old Woman who had called her self by the forged Name of  Competency  of∣fered her self for our Guide She carrried under her Garment a Golden Bow which she no soon∣er held up in her Hand but the Dogs lay down and the Gates flew open for our Reception We were led through an Hundred Iron Doors before we entered the Temple At the upper End of it sat the God of  Avarice  with a long filthy Beard and a meagre starved Countenance enclosed with Heaps of Ingots and Pyramids of Money but half naked and shivering with Cold On his Right Hand was a Fiend called  Rapine  and on his Left a particular Favourite to whom he had given the Title of  Parsimony  The First was his Collector and the other his Cashier  There were several long Tables placed on each Side of the Temple with respective Officers at∣tending behind them Some of these I enquired into At the first Table was kept the Office of  Corruption  Seeing a Solicitor extremely busy and whispering every Body that passed by I kept my Eye upon him very attentively and saw him often going up to a Person that had a Pen in his Hand with a Multiplication Table and an Al∣manack  before him which as I afterwards heard was all the Learning he was Master of The Soli∣citor would often apply himself to his Ear and at the same Time convey Money into his Hand for which the other would give him out a Piece of Paper or Parchment signed and sealed in Form The Name of this dextrous and successful Soli∣citor was  Bribery  At the next Table was the Office of  Extortion  Behind it sate a Person in a BobWig counting over a great Sum of Money He gave out little Purses to several who after a short Tour brought him in Return Sacks full of the same Kind of Coin I saw at the same Time a Person called  Fraud  who sate behind a Counter with false Scales light Weights and scanty Measures by the skilful Application of which Instruments she had got together an im∣mense Heap of Wealth It would be endless to name the several Officers or describe the Vora∣ries that attended in this Temple There were many old Men panting and breathless reposing their Heads on Bags of Money nay many of them actually dying whose very Pangs and Con∣vulsions which rendered their Purses useless to them only made them grasp 'em the faster There were some tearing with one Hand all Things even to the Garments and Flesh of ma∣ny miserable Persons who stood before them and with the other Hand throwing away what they had seized to Harlots Flatterers and Pan∣ders that stood behind them  On a sudden the whole Assembly fell a trem∣bling and upon Enquiry I found that the great Room we were in was haunted with a Spectre that many Times a Day appeared to them and terrified them to Distraction  In the midst of their Terror and Amazement the Apparition entered which I immediate∣ly knew to be  Poverty  Whether it were by my Acquaintance with this Phantom which  had render'd the Sight of her more familiar to me or however it was she did not make so indi∣gent or frightful a Figure in my Eye as the God of this loathsome Temple The miserable Vota∣ries of this Place were I found of another Mind Every one fancied himself threatned by the Apparition as she stalked about the Room and began to lock their Coffers and tie their Bags with the utmost Fear and Trembling  I must confess I look upon the Passion which I saw in this unhappy People to be of the same Nature with those unaccountable Antipathies which some Persons are born with or rather as a kind of Phrensy not unlike that which throws a Man into Terrors and Agonies at the Sight of so useful and innocent a Thing as Water The whole Assembly was surprised when instead of paying my Devotions to the Deity whom they all adored they saw me address my self to the Phantom  Oh  Poverty  said I my first Petition to thee is That thou wouldst never appear to me hereafter but if thou wilt not grant me this that thou wouldst not bear a Form more terrible than that in which thou appearest to me at pre∣sent Let not thy Threats and Menaces betray me to any Thing that is ungrateful or unjust Let me not shut my Ears to the Cries of the Needy Let me not forget the Person that has deserved well of me Let me not for any Fear of thee desert my Friend my Principles or my Honour If Wealth is to visit me and to come with her usual Attendants  Vanity  and  Avarice  do thou Oh  Poverty  hasten to my Rescue but bring along with thee the two Sisters in whose Company thou art always chearful  Li∣berty  and  Innocence  The Conclusion of this Vision must be deferr'd to another Opportunity  The TATLER N  o    Ex humili summa ad Fastigia Rerum  Extollit quoties voluit Fortuna jocari  Juv  From  Saturday Jan  to  Tuesday Jan    From my own Apartment  January  I Went on  Saturday  last to make a Visit in the City and as I passed through  Cheapside  I saw Crowds of People turning down towards the  Bank  and struggling who should first get their Money into the newerected Lottery It gave me a great Notion of the Credit of our present Go∣vernment and Administration to find People press as eagerly to pay Money as they would to re∣ceive it and at the same Time a due Respect for that Body of Men who have found out so plea∣sing an Expedient for carrying on the Common Cause that they have turned a Tax into a Diver∣sion The Chearfulness of Spirit and the Hopes of Success which this Project has occasioned in this great City lightens the Burden of the War and puts me in Mind of some Games which they say were invented by wise Men who were Lovers of their Country to make their FellowCitizens undergo the Tediousness and Fatigues of a long Siege I think there is a Kind of Homage due to Fortune if I may call it so and that I should be wanting to my self if I did not lay in my Pre∣tences to her Favour and pay my Compliments to her by Recommending a Ticket to her Dispo∣sal For this Reason upon my Return to my Lodgings I sold off a Couple of Globes and a Telescope which with the Cash I had by me  raised the Sum that was requisite for that Purpose I find by my Calculations that it is but an Hun∣dred and Fifty Thousand to One against my be∣ing worth a Thousand Pounds  per Annum  for Thirty two Years and if any Plumb in the City will lay me an Hundred and Fifty Thousand Pounds to Twenty Shillings which is an even Bett that I am not this fortunate Man I will take the Wager and shall look upon him as a Man of singular Courage and Fairdealing having given Orders to Mr  Morphew  to subscribe such a Policy in my Behalf if any Person accepts of the Offer I must confess I have had such private Intimations from the Twinkling of a certain Star in some of my Astronomical Observations that I should be unwilling to take Fifty Pounds a Year for my Chance unless it were to oblige a parti∣cular Friend My chief Business at present is to prepare my Mind for this Change of Fortune For as  Seneca  who was a greater Moralist and a much richer Man than I shall be with this Addi∣tion to my present Income says  Munera ista For∣tune putatis Insidiae sunt What we look upon as Gifts and Presents of Fortune are Traps and Snares which she lays for the Unwary  I am arming my self against her Favours with all my Philosophy and that I may not lose my self in such a Re∣dundance of unnecessary and superfluous Wealth  I have determined to settle an Annual Pension ou  of it upon a Family of  Palatines  and by tha  Means give these unhappy Strangers a Tast o  British  Property At the same Time as I hav  an excellent Servant Maid whose Diligence i  attending me has increased in Proportion to my Infirmities I shall settle upon her the Revenu  arising out of the Ten Pounds and amounting t  Fourteen Shillings  per Annum  with which sh  may retire into  Wales  where she was born a Gen¦tlewoman and pass the remaining Part of he  ays in a Condition suitable to her Birth an  Quality It was impossible for me to make an Inspection into my own Fortune on this Occasion without seeing at the same Time the Fate of o∣thers who are embarked in the same Adventure And indeed it was a great Pleasure to me to ob∣serve That the War which generally impove∣rishes those who furnish out the Expence of it will by this Means give Estates to some without making others the poorer for it I have lately seen several in Liveries who will give as good of their own very suddenly and took a particular Satisfaction in the Sight of a young Country Wench whom I this Morning passed by as she was whirling her Mop with her Petticoats tucked up very agreeably who if there is any Truth in my Art is within Ten Months of being the hand∣somest great Fortune in Town I must confess I was so struck with the Foresight of what she is to be that I treated her accordingly and said to her Pray young Lady permit me to pass by I would for this Reason advise all Masters and Mistresses to carry it with great Moderation and Condescention towards their Servants till next  Michaelmas  lest the Superiority at that Time should be inverted I must likewise admonish all my Brethren and FellowAdventurers to fill their Minds with proper Arguments for their Support and Consolation in case of ill Success It so hap∣pens in this Particular that though the Gainers will have Reason to rejoice the Losers will have no Reason to complain I remember the Day after the Thousand Pound Prize was drawn in the Penny Lottery I went to visit a splenatick Ac∣quaintance of mine who was under much De∣jection and seemed to me to have suffered some great Disappointment Upon Enquiry I found he had put Twopence for himself and his Son into the Lottery and that neither of them had drawn the Thousand Pound Hereupon this un∣lucky Person took Occasion to enumerate the  Misfortunes of his Life and concluded with tel∣ling me That he never was successful in any of his Undertakings I was forced to comfort him with the common Reflection upon such Occasions That Men of the greatest Merit are not always Men of the greatest Success and that Persons of his Character must not expect to be as happy as Fools I shall proceed in the like Manner with my Rivals and Competitors for the Thousand Pounds a Year which we are now in Pursuit of and that I may give general Content to the whole Body of Candidates I shall allow all that draw Prizes to be fortunate and all that miss them to be wise  I must not here omit to acknowledge that I have received several Letters upon this Subject but find one common Error running through them all which is That the Writers of them be∣lieve their Fate in these Cases depends upon the Astrologer and not upon the Stars as in the fol∣lowing Letter from one who I fear flatters him∣self with Hopes of Success which are altogether groundless since he does not seem to me so great a Fool as he takes himself to be  SIR  COming to Town and finding my Friend Mr  Partridge  dead and buried and you the only Conjurer in Repute I am under a Ne∣cessity of applying my self to you for a Favour which nevertheless I confess it would better be∣come a Friend to ask than one who is as I am altogether a Stranger to you but Poverty you know is impudent and as that gives me the Occasion so that alone could give me the Con∣fidence to be thus importunate  I am Sir very poor and very desirous to be otherwise I have got Ten Pounds which I de∣sign to venture in the Lottery now on foot What I desire of you is that by your Art you will  choose such a Ticket for me as shall arise a Bene∣fit sufficient to maintain me I must beg Leave to inform you That I am good for nothing and must therefore insist upon a larger Lot than would satisfy those who are capable by their own Abilities of adding something to what you should assign 'em whereas I must expect an absolute independant Maintenance because as I said I can do nothing 'Tis possible after this free Confession of mine you may think I don't deserve to be rich but I hope you'll like∣wise observe I can ill afford to be poor My own Opinion is I am well qualified for an Estate and have a good Title to Luck in a Lot∣tery but I resign my self wholly to your Mercy not without Hopes that you will consi∣der the less I deserve the greater the Generosity in you If you reject me I have agreed with an Acquaintance of mine to bury me for my Ten Pounds I once more recommend my self to your Favour and bid you  Adieu  I cannot forbear publishing another Letter which I have received because it redounds to my own Credit as well as to that of a very honest Footman  Jan  Mr Bickerstaff  I AM bound in Justice to acquaint you That I put an Advertisement into your last Paper about a Watch which was lost and was brought to me on the very Day your Paper came out by a Footman who told me That he would have brought it if he had not read your Discourse of that Day against Avarice but that since he had read it he scorned to take a Reward for doing what in Justice he ought to do I am  SIR  Your most humble Servant  John Hamond  The

 to  Thursd Jan    From my own Apartment  Jan  THere is a Sect of ancient Philosophers who I think have left more Volumes behind them and those better written than any other of the Fraternities in Philosophy It was a Maxim of this Sect That all those who do not live up to the Principles of Reason and Virtue are Madmen Every one who governs himself by these Rules is allowed the Title of Wise and reputed to be in his Senses and every one in Proportion as he deviates from them is pronounced Frantick and Distracted  Cicero  having chosen this Maxim for his Theme takes Occasion to argue from it very agreeably with  Clodius  his implacable Adversary who had procured his Banishment A City says he is an Assembly distinguished into Bodies of Men who are in Possession of their respective Rights and Privileges cast under proper Subor∣dinations and in all its Parts obedient to the Rules of Law and Equity He then represents the Government from whence he was banished at a Time when the Consul Senate and Laws had lost their Authority as a Commonwealth of Lu∣naricks For this Reason he regards his Expul∣sion from  Rome  as a Man would being turned out of  Bedlam  if the Inhabitants of it should drive  him out of their Walls as a Person unfit for their Community We are therefore to look upon every Man's Brain to be touched however he may appear in the general Conduct of his Life if he has an unjustifiable Singularity in any Part of his Conversation or Behaviour Or if he swerves from right Reason however common his Kind of Madness may be we shall not excuse him for its being epidemical it being our present Design to clap up all such as have the Marks of Madness upon them who are now permitted to go about the Streets for no other Reason but because they do no Mischief in their Fits Abundance of ima∣ginary great Men are put in Straw to bring them to a right Sense of themselves And is it not al∣together as reasonable that an insignificant Man who has an immoderate Opinion of his Merits and a quite different Notion of his own Abilities from what the rest of the World entertain should have the same Care taken of him as a Beggar who fancies himself a Duke or a Prince Or Why should a Man who starves in the Midst of Plenty be trusted with himself more than he who fancies he is an Emperor in the Midst of Poverty I have several Women of Quality in my Thoughts who set so exorbitant a Value upon themselves that I have often most heartily pitied them and wished them for their Recovery under the same Discipline with the Pewterer's Wife I find by several Hints in ancient Authors that when the  Romans  were in the Height of Power and Luxu∣ry they assigned out of their vast Dominions an Island called  Anticyra  as an Habitation for Mad∣men This was the Bedlam of the  Roman  Em∣pire whither all Persons who had lost their Wits used to resort from all Parts of the World in Quest of them Several of the  Roman  Emperors were advised to repair to this Island but most of them instead of listening to such sober Counsels gave Way to their Distraction till the People  knocked them in the Head as despairing of their Cure In short it was as usual for Men of distem∣pered Brains to take a Voyage to  Anticyra  in those Days as it is in ours for Persons who have a Dis∣order in their Lungs to go to  Montpellier  The prodigious Crops of Hellebore with which this whole Island abounded did not only furnish them with incomparable Tea Snuff and  Hungary  Water but impregnated the Air of the Country with such sober and salutiferous Steams as very much comforted the Heads and refreshed the Sen∣ses of all that breathed in it A discarded States∣man that at his first Landing appeared stark sta∣ring mad would become calm in a Week's Time and upon his Return Home live easy and satisfied in his Retirement A moaping Lover would grow a pleasant Fellow by that Time he had rid thrice about the Island and a hairbrained Rake after a short Stay in the Country go Home again a composed grave worthy Gentleman  I have premised these Particulars before I enter on the main Design of this Paper because I would not be thought altogether notional in what I have to say and pass only for a Projector in Morality I could quote  Horace  and  Seneca  and some other ancient Writers of good Repute upon the same Occasion and make out by their Testimony that our Streets are filled with distracted Persons that our Shops and Taverns private and publick Hou∣ses swarm with them and that it is very hard to make up a tolerable Assembly without a Majo∣rity of them But what I have already said is I hope sufficient to justify the ensuing Project which I shall therefore give some Account of without any further Preface  It is humbly proposed That a proper Recep∣tacle or Habitation be forthwith erected for all such Persons as upon due Trial and Examination shall appear to be out of their Wits  That to serve the present Exigency the Col∣lege in  MoorFields  be very much extended at both Ends and that it be converted into a Square by adding three other Sides to it  That no Body be admitted into these Three additional Sides but such whose Phrensy can lay no Claim to an Apartment in that Row of Build∣ing which is already erected  That the Architect Physician Apothecary Surgeon Keepers Nurses and Porters be all and each of them crack'd provided that their Phrensy does not lie in the Profession or Employment to which they shall severally and respectively be as∣signed  NB  It is thought fit to give the foregoing Notice that none may present himself here for any Post of Honour or Profit who is not duly qualified  That over all the Gates of the additional Buildings there be Figures placed in the same Manner as over the Entrance of the Edifice already erected provided they represent such Distracti∣ons only as are proper for those additional Build∣ings as of an envious Man gnawing his own Flesh a Gamester pulling himself by the Ears and knocking his Head against a Marble Pillar a covetous Man warming himself over a Heap of Gold a Coward flying from his own Shadow and the like  Having laid down this general Scheme of my Design I do hereby invite all Persons who are willing to encourage so publickspirited a Project to bring in their Contributions as soon as possible and to apprehend forthwith any Politician whom they shall catch raving in a Coffeehouse or any Freethinker whom they shall find publishing his Deliriums or any other Person who shall give the like manifest Signs of a crazed Imagination And I do at the same Time give this publick Notice  to all the Madmen about this great City That they may return to their Senses with all imagi∣nable Expedition lest if they should come into my Hands I should put them into a Regimen which they would not like for if I find any one of them persist in his frantick Behaviour I will make him in a Month's Time as famous as ever  Oliver  's Porter was  The TATLER N

Affectation and can converse with Men without any private Design of imposing Chains and Fet∣ters  Belvidera  whom I visited this Evening is one of these There is an invincible Prejudice in Favour of all she says from her being a beau∣tiful Woman because she does not consider her self as such when she talks to you This amiable Temper gives a certain Tincture to all her Dis∣course and made it very agreeable to me till we were interrupted by  Lydia  a Creature who has all the Charms that can adorn a Woman Her Attractions would indeed be irresistible but that she thinks them so and is always employing them in Stratagems and Conquests When I turned my Eye upon her as she sat down I saw she was a Person of that Character which for the further Information of my Country Correspon∣dents I had long wanted an Opportunity of ex∣plaining  Lydia  is a finished  Coquet  which is a  Sect among Women of all others the most mis∣chievous and makes the greatest Havock and Disorder in Society I went on in the Dis∣course I was in with  Belvidera  without showing that I had observed any Thing extraordinary in  Lydia  Upon which I immediately saw her look me over as some very illbred Fellow and casting a scornful Glance on my Dress give a Shrug at  Belvidera  But as much as she despised me she wanted my Admiration and made Twenty Of∣fers to bring my Eyes her Way But I reduced her to a Restlesness in her Seat and impertinent playing of her Fan and many other Motions and Gestures before I took the least Notice of her At last I looked at her with a Kind of Surprize as if she had before been unobserved by reason of an ill Light where she sar It is not to be expressed what a sudden Joy I saw rise in her Countenance even at the Approbation of such a very old Fellow But she did not long enjoy her Triumph without a Rival for there imme∣diately entred  Castabella  a Lady of a quite con∣trary Character that is to say as eminent a  Prude  as  Lydia  is a  Coquet Belvidera  gave me a Glance which methought intimated that they were both Curiosities in their Kind and worth remarking As soon as we were again seated I stole Looks at each Lady as if I was comparing their Perfe∣ctions  Belvidera  observed it and began to lead me into a Discourse of them both to their Faces which is to be done easily enough for one Wo∣man is generally so intent upon the Faults of another that she has not Reflection enough to observe when her own are represented I have taken Notice Mr  Bickerstaff  said  Belvidera  that you have in some Parts of your Writings drawn Characters of our Sex in which you have not to my Apprehension been clear enough and di∣stinct particularly in those of a  Prude  and a  Coquet  Upon the Mention of this  Lydia  was rouzed with  the Expectation of seeing  Castabella  's Picture and  Castabella  with the Hopes of that of  Lydia  Madam said I to  Belvidera  when we consider Nature we shall often find very contrary Effects flow from the same Cause The  Prude  and  Coquet  as different as they appear in their Behaviour are in Reality the same Kind of Women The Motive of Action in both is the Affectation of pleasing Men They are Sisters of the same Blood and Constitution only one chuses a grave the other a light Dress The  Prude  appears more virtuous the  Coquet  more vicious than she really is The distant Behaviour of the  Prude  tends to the same Purpose as the Advances of the  Coquet  and you have as little Reason to fall into Despair from the Severity of the one as to con∣ceive Hope from the Familiarity of the latter What leads you into a clear Sense of their Cha∣racter is That you may observe each of them has the Distinction of Sex in all her Thoughts Words and Actions You can never mention any Assembly you were lately in but one asks you with a rigid the other with a sprightly Air Pray what Men were there As for  Prudes  it must be confessed that there are several of them who like Hypocrites by long Practice of a false Part become sincere or at least delude themselves in∣to a Relief that they are so  For the Benent of this Society of Ladies I shall propose one Rule to them as a Test of their Virtue I find in a very celebrated modern Au∣thor That the great Foundress of the Pietists  Madam de Bourignon  who was no less famous for the Sanctity of her Life than for the Singularity of some of her Opinions was used to boast That she had not only the Spirit of Continency in her self but that she had also the Power of commu∣nicating it to all who beheld her This the Scof∣fers of those Days called  The Gift of Infrigidation  and took Occasion from it to rally her Face ra∣ther  than admire her Virtue I would therefore advise the  Prude  who has a Mind to know the Integrity of her own Heart to lay her Hand se∣riously upon it and to examine her self whether she could sincerely rejoice in such a Gift of con∣veying chast Thoughts to all her Male Beholders If she has any Aversion to the Power of Inspring so great a Virtue whatever Notion she may have of her Perfection she deceives her own Heart and is still in the State of  Prudery  Some perhaps will look upon the Boast of  Madam de Bourignon  as the utmost Ostentation of a  Prude  If you would see the Humour of a  Coquet  push∣ed to the last Excess you may find an Instance of it in the following Story which I will set down at length because it pleased me when I read it though I cannot recollect in what Au∣thor  A young  Coquet  Widow in  France  having been followed by a  Gascon  of Quality who had boasted among his Companions of some Favours which he had never received to be revenged of him sent for him one Evening and told him It was in his Power to do her a very particular Ser∣vice The  Gascon  with much Profession of his Readiness to obey her Commands begged to hear in what Manner she designed to employ him You know said the Widow my Friend  Belinda  and must often have heard of the Jea∣lousy of that impotent Wretch her Husband Now it is absolutely necessary for the carrying on a certain Affair That his Wife and I should be together a whole Night What I have to ask of you is to dress your self in her NightClothes and lie by him a whole Night in her Place that he may not miss her while she is with me The  Gascon  though of a very lively and undertaking Complexion began to startle at the Proposal Nay says the Widow if you have not the Cou∣rage to go through what I ask of you I must  employ some Body else that will Madam says the  Gascon  I'll kill him for you if you please but for lying with himHow is it possible to do it without being discovered If you do not discover your self says the Widow you will lie safe enough for he is past all Curiosity He comes in at Night while she is asleep and goes out in a Morning before she awakes and is in Pain for nothing so he knows she is there Ma∣dam replied the  Gascon  How can you reward me for passing a Night with this old Fellow The Widow answered with a Laugh Perhaps by ad∣mitting you to pass a Night with one you think more agreeable He took the Hint put on his NightClothes and had not been abed above an Hour before he heard a Knocking at the Door and the Treading of one who approach'd the other Side of the Bed and who he did not question was the good Man of the House I do not know whether the Story would be better by telling you in this Place or at the End of it That the Person who went to Bed to him was our young  Coquet  Widow The  Gascon  was in a terrible Fright every Time she moved in the Bed or turned towards him and did not fail to shrink from her till he had conveyed himself to the very Ridge of the Bed I will not dwell upon the Perplexity he was in the whole Night which was augmented when he observed that it was now bread Day and that the Husband did not yet offer to get up and go about his Bu∣siness All that the  Gascon  had for it was to keep his Face turned from him and to feign himself asleep when to his utter Confusion the Widow at last puts out her Arm and pulls the Bell at her Bed's Head In came her Friend and Two or Three Companions to whom the  Gascon  had boasted of her Favours The Wi∣dow jumped into a WrappingGown and joined with the rest in laughing at this Man of Intrigue  The TATLER N  o    Nimirum Insanus paucis videatur eo quad  Maxima Pars Hominum Morbo jactatur exdem  Hor  From  Saturd Jan

Disguises and breaks out in Ten Thousand different Symptoms Every one feels it in himself and yet wonders to see it in his Neighbour I must confess I met with an Instance of it the other Day where I should very little have expected it Who would believe the proud Person I am going to speak of is a Cobler upon  LudgateHill  This Artist being naturally a Lover of Respect and considering that his Cir∣cumstances are such that no Man living will give it him has contrived the Figure of a Beau in Wood who stands before him in a bending Po∣sture with his Hat under his Left Arm and his Right Hand extended in such a Manner as to hold a Thread a Piece of Wax or an Awl according to the particular Service in which his Master thinks fit to employ him When I saw him he held a Candle in this obsequious Posture I was very well pleased with the Cobler's Invention that had so ingeniously contrived an Inferior and stood a little while contemplating this invert∣ed Idolatry wherein the Image did Homage to the Man When we meet with such a fantastick Vanity in one of this Order it is no Wonder if we may trace it through all Degrees above it  and particularly through all the Steps of Great∣ness We casily see the Absurdity of Pride when it enters into the Heart of a Cobler though in Reality it is altogether as ridiculous and unreaso∣nable wherever it takes Possession of an Humane Creature There is no Temptation to it from the Reflexion upon our Being in general or upon any Comparative Perfection whereby one Man may excel another The greater a Man's Know∣ledge is the greater Motive he may seem to have for Pride but in the same Proportion as the one rises the other sinks it being the chief Office of Wisdom to discover to us our Weaknesses and Imperfections  As Folly is the Foundation of Pride the na∣tural Superstructure of it is Madness If there was an Occasion for the Experiment I would not question to make a proud Man a Lunatick in Three Weeks Time provided I had it in my Power to ripen his Phrensy with proper Applica∣tions It is an admirable Reflection in  Terence  where it is said of a Parasite  Hic Homines ex Stul∣tis facit Insanos This Fellow  says he  has an Art of converting Fools into Madmen  When I was in  France  the Region of Complaisance and Vanity I have often observed that a great Man who has entered a Levy of Flatterers humble and tempe∣rate has grown so insensibly heated by the Court which was paid him on all Sides that he has been quite distracted before he could get into his Coach  If we consult the Collegiates of  Moorfields  we shall find most of them are beholden to their Pride for their Introduction into that magnificent Palace I had some Years ago the Curiosity to enquire into the particular Circumstances of these whimsical Freeholders and learned from their own Mouths the Condition and Character of each of them Indeed I found that all I spoke to were Persons of Quality There were at that  Time Five Dutchesses Three Earls Two Hea∣then Gods an Emperor and a Prophet There were also a great Number of such as were locked up from their Estates and others who concealed their Titles A Leatherseller of  Taunton  whis∣per'd me in my Ear That he was the Duke of  Monmouth  but begged me not to betray him At a little Distance from him sat a Taylor's Wife who asked me as I went by if I had seen the Swordbearer Upon which I presumed to ask her Who she was And was answered  My Lady Mayoress  I was very sensibly touched with Compassion towards these miserable People and indeed ex∣tremely mortified to see Humane Nature capable of being thus disfigured However I reaped this Benefit from it That I was resolved to guard my self against a Passion which makes such Havock in the Brain and produces so much Disorder in the Imagination For this Reason I have endeavoured to keep down the secret Swel∣lings of Resentment and stifle the very first Sug∣gestions of Selfesteem to establish my Mind in Tranquility and overvalue nothing in my own or in another's Possession  For the Benefit of such whose Heads are a lit∣tle turned though not to so great a Degree as to qualify them for the Place of which I have been now speaking I shall assign one of the Sides of the College which I am erecting for the Cure of this dangerous Distemper  The most remarkable of the Persons whose Di∣sturbance arises from Pride and whom I shall use all possible Diligence to cure are such as are hidden in the Appearance of quite contrary Ha∣bits and Dispositions Among such I shall in the first Place take Care of one who is under the most subtle Species of Pride that I have observed  my whole Experience  This Patient is a Person for whom I have a great Respect as being an old Courtier and a Friend of mine in my Youth The Man has but a bare Subsistence just enough to pay his Reckoning with us at the  Trumpet  But by having spent the Beginning of his Life in the Hearing of great Men and Persons of Power he is always promi∣sing to do good Offices to introduce every Man he converses with into the World will desire one of ten Times his Substance to let him see him sometimes and hints to him that he does not forget him He answers to Matters of no Consequence with great Circumspection but however maintains a general Civility in his Words and Actions and an insolent Benevo∣lence to all whom he has to do with This he practises with a grave Tone and Air and tho' I am his Senior by Twelve Years and richer by Forty Pounds  per Annum  he had Yesterday the Impudence to commend me to my Face and tell me He should be always ready to encourage me In a Word he is a very insignificant Fel∣low but exceeding Gracious The best Return I can make him for his Favours is to carry him my self to  Bedlam  and see him well taken Care of  The next Person I shall provide for is of a quite contrary Character that has in him all the Stiffness and Insolence of Quality without a Grain of Sense or Good Nature to make it either respected or belov'd His Pride has infected every Muscle of his Face and yet after all his Endea∣vours to show Mankind that he contemns them he is only neglected by all that see him as not of Consequence enough to be hated  For the Cure of this particular Sort of Mad∣ness it will be necessary to break through all Forms with him and familiarize his Carriage by the Use of a good Cudgel It may likewise be of  great Benefit to make him jump over a Stick half a Dozen Times every Morning  A Third whom I have in my Eye is a young Fellow whose Lunacy is such that he boasts of nothing but what he ought to be ashamed of He is vain of being rotten and talks publickly of having committed Crimes which he ought to be hanged for by the Laws of his Country  There are several others whose Brains are hurt with Pride and whom I may hereafter attempt to recover but shall conclude my present List with an old Woman who is just dropping into her Grave that talks of nothing but her Birth Tho' she has not a Tooth in her Head she ex∣pects to be valued for the Blood in her Veins which she fancies is much better than that which glows in the Cheeks of  Belinda  and sets half the Town on Fire  The TATLER N  o    Veniunt a Dote Sagittae  Juv  From  Tuesday Jan  to  Thursday Febr    From my own Apartment  February  THis Morning I received a Letter from a For∣tuneHunter which being better in its Kind than Men of that Character usually write I have thought fit to communicate to the Publick  To  Isaac Bickerstaff  Esq  SIR  I Take the Boldness to recommend to your Care the inclos'd Letter not knowing how to communicate it but by your Means to the agreeable Country Maid you mention with so  much Honour in your Discourse concerning the Lottery  I should be asham'd to give you this Trouble without offering at some small Requital I shall therefore direct a new Pair of Globes and a Telescope of the best Maker to be left for you at Mr  Morphew  's as a Testimony of the great Respect with which I am  Your most humble Servant  c  To  Mopsa  in  SheerLane  Fairest Unknown  IT being discovered by the Stars that about Ten Months hence you will run the Hazard of being persecuted by many worthless Preten∣ders to your Person unless timely prevented I now offer my Service for your Security against the Persecution that threatens you This is therefore to let you know That I have con∣ceived a most extraordinary Passion for you and that for several Days I have been perpetually haunted with the Vision of a Person I have ne∣ver yet seen To satisfy you that I am in my Senses and that I do not mistake you for any one of higher Rank I assure you that in your daily Employment you appear to my Imagina∣tion more agreeable in a short scanty Petticoat than the finest Woman of Quality in her spread∣ing Fardingal and that the dextrous Twirl of your Mon has more native Charms than the studied Airs of a Lady's Fan In a Word I am captivated with your Menial Qualifications The Domestick Virtues adorn you like Atten∣dant  Cupids  Cleanliness and healthful Industry wait on all your Motions and Dust and Cob∣webs fly your Approach  Now to give you an honest Account of my self and that you may see my Designs are ho∣nourable I am an Esquire of an ancient Family born to about Fifteen Hundred Pounds a Year  half of which I have spent in discovering my self to be a Fool and with the rest am resolv'd to retire with some plain honest Partner and study to be wiser I had my Education in a Lac'd Coat and a  French  DancingSchool and by my Travel into Foreign Parts have just as much Breeding to spare as you may think you want which I intend to exchange as fast as I can for old  English  Honesty and good Sense I will not impose on you by a false Re∣commendation of my Person which to show you my Sincerity is none of the handsomest being of a Figure somewhat short but what I want in Length I make out in Breadth But in Amends for that and all other Defects if you can like me when you see me I shall continue to you whether I find you Fair Black or Brown  The most constant of Lovers  Jan  This Letter seems to be written by a Wag and for that Reason I am not much concern'd for what Reception  Mopsa  shall think fit to give it but the following certainly proceeds from a poor Heart that languishes under the most deplorable Misfortune that possibly can befal a Woman A Man that is treacherously dealt with in Love may have Recourse to many Consolations He may gracefully break through all Opposition to his Mistress or explain with his Rival urge his own Constancy or aggravate the Falshood by which it is repay'd But a Woman that is ill  reated has no Refuge in her Griefs but in Si∣  ence and Secrecy The World is so unjust that  Female Heart which has been once touched  s thought for ever blemished The very Grief  n this Case is looked upon as a Reproach and  Complaint almost a Breach of Chastity For  hese Reasons we see Treachery and Falshood  re become as it were MaleVices and are sel∣  om found never acknowledged in the other  Sex This may serve to introduce  Statira's  Let∣ter which without any Turn or Art has some∣thing so pathetical and moving in it that I verily believe it to be true and therefore heartily pity the injured Creature that writ it  To  Isaac Bickerstaff  Esq  SIR  YOU seem in many of your Writings to be a Man of a very compassionate Temper and well acquainted with the Passion of Love This encourages me to apply my self to you in my present Distress which I believe you will look upon to be very great and treat with Ten∣derness notwithstanding it wholly arises from Love and that it is a Woman that makes this Confession I am now in the Twenty third Year of my Age and have for a great while entertained the Addresses of a Man who I thought lov'd me more than Life I am sure I did him and must own to you not without some Confusion that I have thought on no∣thing else for these two long Years but the happy Life we should lead together and the Means I should use to make my self still dearer to him My Fortune was indeed much beyond his and as I was always in the Company of my Relations he was forced to discover his In∣clinations and declare himself to me by Stories of other Persons kind Looks and many Ways which he knew too well that I understood Oh Mr  Bickerstaff  it is impossible to tell you how industrious I have been to make him ap∣pear lovely in my Thoughts I made it a Point of Conscience to think well of him and of no Man else But he has since had an Estate fallen to him and makes Love to another of a greater Fortune than mine I could not believe the Re∣port of this at first but about a Fortnight ago I was convinced of the Truth of it by his own  Behaviour He came to give our Family a formal Visit when as there were several in Company and many Things talked of the Discourse fell upon some unhappy Woman who was in my own Circumstances It was said by one in the Room That they could not be∣lieve the Story could be true because they did not believe any Man could be so false Upon which I stole a Look upon him with an Anguish not to be express'd He saw my Eyes full of Tears yet had the Cruelty to say That he could see no Falshood in Alterations of this Na∣ture where there had been no Contracts or Vows interchanged Pray do not make a Jest of Misery but tell me seriously your Opinion of his Behaviour and if you can have any Pity for my Condition publish this in your next Paper that being the only Way I have of complaining of his Unkindness and showing him the Injustice he has done me I am  Your humble Servant The unfortunate  Statira  The Name my Correspondent gives her self puts me in Mind of my old reading in Romances and brings into my Thoughts a Speech of the renowned  Don Bellianis  who upon a Complaint made him of a discourteous Knight that had left his injur'd Paramour in the same Manner dries up her Tears with a Promise of Relief  Disconsolate Damsel  quoth he  a foul Disgrace it were to all right worthy Professors of Chivalry if such a Blot to Knighthood should pass unchastised Give me to know the Abode of this recreant Lover and I will give him as a Feast to the Fowls of the Air or drag him bound before you at my Horse's Tail  I am not ashamed to own my self a Champion of distressed Damsels and would venture as far  to relieve them as  Don Bellianis  for whic Reason I do invite this Lady to let me know the Name of the Traitor' who has deceived her and do promise not only her but all the Fair One of  Great Britain  who lie under the same Cala∣mity to employ my Right Hand for their Re∣dress and serve them to my last Drop of Ink  The TATLER N  o    Ingenio Manus est Cervix caesa  Juv  From  Thursd Febr  to  Saturd Febr    From my own Apartment  February  WHen my Paper for to Morrow was prepa∣red for the Press there came in this Mor∣ning a Mail from  Holland  which brought me se∣veral Advices from Foreign Parts and took my Thoughts off Domestick Affairs Among others I have a Letter from a Burgher of  Amsterdam  who makes me his Compliments and tells me he has sent me several Draughts of Humorous and Satyrical Pictures by the best Hands of the  Dutch  Nation They are a trading People and in their very Minds Mechanicks They express their Wit in Manufacture as we do in Manu∣script He informs me That a very witty Hand has lately represented the present Posture of Pu∣blick Affairs in a Landskip or rather Seapiece wherein the Potentates of the Alliance are fi∣gured as their Interests correspond with or af∣fect each other under the Appearance of Com∣manders of Ships These Vessels carry the Co∣lours of the respective Nations concerned in the present War The whole Design seems to tend  to one Point which is That several Squadrons of  British  and  Dutch  Ships are battering a  French  Man of War in order to make her deliver up a LongBoat with  Spanish  Colours My Corre∣spondent informs me That a Man must under∣stand the Compass perfectly well to be able to comprehend the Beauty and Invention of this Piece which is so skilfully drawn that the par∣ticular Views of every Prince in  Europe  are seen according as the Ships lie to the main Figure in the Picture and as that Figure may help or re∣tard their Sailing It seems this Curiosity is now on Board a Ship bound for  England  and with other Rarities made a Present to me As soon as it arrives I design to expose it to publick View at my Secretary Mr  Lillie  's who shall have an Explication of all the Terms of Art and I doubt not but it will give as good Con∣tent as the moving Picture in  Fleetstreet  But above all the Honours I have received from the Learned World abroad I am most delighted with the following Epistle from  Rome  Pasquin  of  Rome  to  Isaac Bickerstaff  of  Great Britain  Greeting  SIR  YOur Reputation has passed the  Alps  and would have come to my Ears by this Time if I had any In short Sir you are looked upon here as a  Northern  Drole and the greatest Vertuoso among the  Tramontanes  Some indeed say That Mr  Bickerstaff  and  Pasquin  are only Names invented to father Compositions which the natural Parent does not care for owning But however that is all agree that there are several Persons who if they durst attack you would endeavour to leave you no more Limbs than I have I need not tell you that my Adversaries have joined in a Confederacy with  Time  to demolish me  and that if I were not a very great Wit  should make the worst Figure in  Europe  bein  abridged of my Legs Arms Nose and Ears  If you think fit to accept of the Correspondenc  of so facetious a Cripple I shall from Tim  to Time send you an Account of what happen  at  Rome  You have only heard of it from  Lati  and  Greek  Authors may perhaps have read n  Accounts from hence but of a Triumph Ovation  or Apotheosis and will doubtless be surprize  to see the Description of a Procession Jubilee o  Canonization I shall however send you wha  the Place affords in Return to what I shall re¦ceive from you If you will acquaint me wit  your next Promotion of General Officers I will send you an Account of our next Advance¦ment of Saints If you will let me know wh  is reckoned the bravest Warrior in  Great Bri∣tain  I'll tell you who is the best Fiddler i  Rome  If you will favour me with an Inven∣tory of the Riches that were brought into you  Nation by Admiral  Wager  I will not fail gi∣ving you an Account of a Pot of Medals tha  has been lately dug up here and are no  under the Examination of our Ministers o  State  There is one Thing in which I desire yo  would be very particular What I mean i  an exact List of all the Religions in  Great Bri¦tain  as likewise the Habits which are sai  here to be the great Points of Conscience i  England  whether they are made of Serge o  BroadCloth of Silk or Linen I should b  glad to see a Model of the most conscientiou  Dress amongst you and desire you would sen  me an Hat of each Religion as likewise i  it be not too much Trouble a Cravat It would also be very acceptable here to receive an Ac∣count of those Two Religious Orders which are lately sprung up amongst you the  Whig  and the  Tories  with the Points of Doctrine Se∣verities in Discipline Penances Mortifications and good Works by which they differ one from another It would be no less kind if you would explain to us a Word which they do not understand even at our  English  Mona∣stery  Toasts  and let us know whether the La∣dies so called are Nuns or LaySisters  In Return I will send you the Secret History of several Cardinals which I have by me in Manuscript with Gallantries Amours Poli∣ticks and Intrigues by which they made their Way to the Holy Purple  But when I propose a Correspondence I must not tell you what I intend to advise you of hereafter and neglect to give you what I have at present The Pope has been sick for this Fortnight of a violent ToothAch which has very much raised the  French  Faction and put the Conclave into a great Ferment Every one of the Pretenders to the Succession is grown Twenty Years older than he was a Fortnight ago Each Candidate tries who shall cough and stoop most for these are at pre∣sent the great Gifts that recommend to the Apostolical Seat which he stands the fairest for who is likely to resign it the soonest I have known the Time when it used to rain Louisd'Ors on such Occasions but whatever is the Matter there are very few of them to be seen at present at  Rome  insomuch that it is thought a Man might purchase Infallibility at a very reasonable Rate It is nevertheless ho∣ped that his Holiness may recover and bury these his imaginary Successors  There has lately been found an Humane Tooth in a Catecomb which has engaged a Couple of Convents in a LawSuit each of them pretending That it belong'd to the JawBone of a Saint who was of their Order The  College have sate upon it thrice and I fine there is a Disposition among them to take i out of the Possession of both the contending Parties by reason of a Speech which was made by one of the Cardinals who by rea∣son of its being found out of the Company of any other Bones asserted That it migh be one of the Teeth which was coughed ou by  Aelia  an old Woman whose Loss is recorded in  Martial  I have nothing remarkable to communicate to you of StateAffairs excepting only that the Pope has lately received an Horse from the  Ger∣man  Ambassador as an Acknowledgment for the Kingdom of  Naples  which is a Fief of the Church His Holiness refused this Horse from the  Germans  ever since the Duke of  Anjou  has been possessed of  Spain  but as they lately took Care to accompany it with a Body of Ten thou∣sand more they have at last overcome his Ho∣liness's Modesty and prevailed upon him to accept the Present I am  SIR  Your most Obedient Humble Servant  PASQUIN  PS  Morforio  is very much Yours  The TATLER N  o    At 'me  Cum magnisvixisse invite fatebitur usque  Invidia  Hor  From  Saturday Febr  to  Tuesday Febr    SheerLane  February  I Find some of the most polite  Latin  Authors who wrote at a Time when  Rome  was in its Glory speak with a certain noble Vanity of the Brightness and Splendour of the Age in which they lived  Pliny  often compliments his Emperor  Trajan  upon this Head and when he would ani∣mate him to any Thing great or disswade him from any Thing that was improper he insinuates that it is befitting or unbecoming the  Claritas Nitor S  uli  that Period of Time which was made illustrious by his Reign When we cast our Eyes back on the History of Mankind and trace them through their several Successions to their first Original we sometimes see them break∣ing out in great and memorable Actions and towring up to the utmost Heights of Virtue and Knowledge when perhaps if we carry our Ob∣servation to a little Distance we see them sunk into Sloth and Ignorance and altogether lost in Darkness and Obscurity Sometimes the whole Species is asleep for Two or Three Generations and then again awakens into Action flourishes in Heroes Philosophers and Poets who do Ho∣nour to humane Nature and leave such Tracts of Glory behind them as distinguish the Years in  which they acted their Part from the ordinary Course of Time  Methinks a Man cannot without a secret Sa∣tisfaction consider the Glory of the present Age which will shine as bright as any other in the Hi∣story of Mankind It is still big with great E∣vents and has already produced Changes and Re∣volutions which will be as much admired by Po∣sterity as any that have happen'd in the Days of our Fathers or in the old Times before them We have seen Kingdoms divided and united Mo∣narchs erected and deposed Nations transferr'd from one Sovereign to another Conquerors rai∣sed to such a Greatness as has given a Terror to  Europe  and thrown down by such a Fall as has moved their Pity  But it is still a more pleasing View to an  English∣man  to see his own Country give the chief In∣fluence to so illustrious an Age and stand in the st ongest Point of Light amidst the diffused Glory that surrounds it  If we begin with Learned Men we may ob∣serve to the Honour of our Country That those who make the greatest Figure in most Arts and Sciences are universally allowed to be of the  Bri∣tish  Nation and what is more remarkable That Men of the greatest Learning are among the Men of the greatest Quality  A Nation may indeed abound with Persons of such uncommon Parts and Worth as may make them rather a Misfortune than a Blessing to the Publick Those who singly might have been of infinite Advantage to the Age they live in may by rising up together in the same Crisis of Time and by interfering in their Pursuits of Honour rather interrupt than promote the Service of their Country Of this we have a famous Instance in the Republick of  Rome  when  Caesar Pompey Cato Cicero  and  Brutus  endeavoured to recom∣mend  themselves at the same Time to the Admi∣ration of their Contemporaries Mankind was not able to provide for so many extraordinary Persons at once or find out Posts suitable to their Ambition and Abilities For this Reason they were all as miserable in their Deaths as they were famous in their Lives and occasioned not only the Ruin of each other but also that of the Commonwealth  It is therefore a particular Happiness to a Peo∣ple when the Men of superior Genius and Cha∣racter are so justly disposed in the high Places of Honour that each of them moves in a Sphere which is proper to him and requires those parti∣cular Qualities in which he excels  If I see a General commanding the Forces of his Country whose Victories are not to be parallel'd in Story and who is as famous for his Negotia∣tions as his Victories and at the same Time see the Management of a Nation's Treasury in the Hands of one who has always distinguish'd him∣self by a generous Contempt of his own private Wealth and an exact Frugality of that which belongs to the Publick I cannot but think a People under such an Administration may pro∣mise themselves Conquest abroad and Plenty at home If I were to wish for a proper Person to preside over the Publick Councils it should cer∣tainly be one as much admir'd for his universal Knowledge of Men and Things as for his Elo∣quence Courage and Integrity in the exerting of such extraordinary Talents  Who is not pleased to see a Person in the highest Station in the Law who was the most eminent in his Profession and the most accomplished Orator at the Bar Or at the Head of the Fleet a Com∣mander under whose Conduct the Common Ene∣my received such a Blow as he has never been able to recover  Were we to form to our selves the Idea of one whom we should think proper to govern a distant Kingdom consisting chiefly of those who differ from us in Religion and are influenced by foreign Politicks would it not be such a one as had sig∣nalized himself by an uniform and unshaken Zeal for the Protestant Interest and by his Dexterity in defeating the Skill and Artifice of its Enemies In short if we find a great Man popular for his Honesty and Humanity as well as famed for his Learning and great Skill in all the Languages of  Europe  or a Person eminent for those Qualifica∣tions which make Men shine in publick Assem∣blies or for that Steadiness Constancy and good Sense which carry a Man to the desired Point through all the Opposition of Tumult and Preju∣dice we have the Happiness to behold them all in Posts suitable to their Characters  Such a Constellation of great Persons if I may so speak while they shine out in their own di∣stinct Capacities reflect a Lustre upon each other but in a more particular Manner on their Sove∣reign who has placed them in those proper Situa∣tions by which their Virtues become so beneficial to all Her Subjects It is the Anniversary of the Birthday of this Glorious Queen which naturally led me into this Field of Contemplation and in∣stead of joining in the publick Exultations that are made on such Occasions to entertain my Thoughts with the more serious Pleasure of ruminating upon the Glories of Her Reign  While I behold Her surrounded with Triumphs and adorned with all the Prosperity and Success which Heaven ever shed on a Mortal and still con∣sidering her self as such tho' the Person appears to me exceedinggreat that has these just Honours paid to her yet I must confess she appears much great er in that she receives them with such a glo∣rious Humilility and shows she has no further Re∣gard for them than as they arise from these great  Events which have made her Subjects happy For my own Part I must confess when I see private Virtues in so high a Degree of Perfection I am not astonished at any extraordinary Success that attends them but look upon publick Triumphs as the natural Consequences of religious Retire∣ments  ADVERTISEMENT  Finding some Persons have mistaken  Pasquin  who was mentioned in my last for one who has been pil∣loried at  Rome  I must here advertise them That it is only a maimed Statue so called on which the private Scandal of that City is generally pasted  Morforio  is a Person of the same Quality who is usually made to answer whatever is published by the other The Wits of that Place like too many of our own Country taking Pleasure in setting innocent People together by the Ears The Mentioning of this Person who is a great Wit and a great Cripple put me in Mind of Mr  Eastcourt  who is under the same Circumstances He was formerly my Apothecary and being at present disabled by the Gout and Stone I must recommend him to the Publick on  Thursday  next that admirable Play of  Ben Johnson  's called  The silent Woman  being appointed to be acted for his Benefit It would be indecent for me to appear twice in a Season at these ludicrous Diversions but as I always give my Man and my Maid one Day in the Year I shall allow them this and am promised by Mr  Eastcourt  my ingenious Apothecary that they shall have a Place kept for them in the first Row of the Middle Gallery  The TATLER N  o    Scelus est jugulare Falernum  Et dare Campano toxica saeva Mero  Mart  From  Tuesd February  to  Thursd February    SheerLane  February  THere is in this City a certain Fraternity of Chymical Operators who work under Ground in Holes Caverns and dark Retirements to conceal their Mysteries from the Eyes and Ob∣servation of Mankind These Subterraneous Phi∣losophers are daily employed in the Transmuta∣tion of Liquors and by the Power of Magical Drugs and Incantations raising under the Streets of  London  the choicest Products of the Hills and Valleys of  France  They can squeeze  Bourdeaux  out of the  Sloe  and draw  Champagne  from an  Ap∣ple Virgil  in that remarkable Prophecy  Incultisque rubens pendebit Sentibus Uva  " The ripening Grape shall hang on ev'ry Thorn  Seems to have hinted at this Art which can turn a Plantation of  Northern  Hedges into a Vineyard These Adepts are known among one another by the Name of WineBrewers and I am afraid do great Injury not only to Her Majesty's Customs but to the Bodies of many of Her good Subjects  Having received sundry Complaints against these invisible Workmen I ordered the proper Officer of my Court to ferret them out of their respective Caves and bring them before me which was Ye∣sterday executed accordingly  The Person who appeared against them was a Merchant who had by him a great Magazine of Wines that he had laid in before the War But these Gentlemen as he said had so vitiated the Nation's Palate that no Man could believe his to be  French  because it did not tast like what they sold for such As a Man never pleads better than where his own Personal Interest is concern'd he exhibited to the Court with great Eloquence That this new Corporation of Druggists had inflamed the Bills of Mortality and puzzled the College of Physicians with Diseases for which they neither knew a Name or Cure He accused some of gi∣ving all their Customers Colicks and Megrims and mentioned one who had boasted he had a Tun of Claret by him that in a Fortnight's Time should give the Gout to a Dozen of the healthful∣est Men in the City provided that their Constitu∣tions were prepared for it by Wealth and Idleness He then enlarged with a great Show of Reason upon the Prejudice which these Mixtures and Compositions had done to the Brains of the  Eng∣lish  Nation as is too visible said he from many late Pamphlets Speeches and Sermons as well as from the ordinary Conversations of the Youth of this Age He then quoted an ingenious Person who would undertake to know by a Man's Wri∣tings the Wine he most delighted in and on that Occasion named a certain Satyrist whom he had discovered to be the Author of a Lampoon by the manifest Tast of the Sloe which show'd it self in it by much Roughness and little Spirit  In the last Place he ascribed to the unnatural Tumults and Fermentations which these Mixtures raise in our Blood the Divisions Heats and Ani∣mosities that reign among us and in particular asserted most of the modern Enthusiasms and Agitations to be nothing else but the Effects of adulterated  Port  The Council for the Brewers had a Face so ex∣tremely inflamed and illuminated with Carbun∣cles that I did not wonder to see him an Advo∣cate for these Sophistications His Rhetorick was likewise such as I should have expected from the common Draught which I found he often drank to a great Excess Indeed I was so surprised at his Figure and Parts that I ordered him to give me a Tast of his usual Liquor which I had no sooner drank but I found a Pimple rising in my F  ehead and felt such a sensible Decay in my Understanding that I would not proceed in the Trial till the Fume of it was entirely dissipa∣ted  This notable Advocate had little to say in the Defence of his C  ents but that they were under a Necessity of making Claret if they would keep open their Doors it being the Nature of Man∣kind to love every Thing that is prohibited He further pretended to reason That it might be as profitable to the Nation to make  French  Wine as  French  Hats and concluded with the great Ad∣vantage that this had already brought to Part of the Kingdom Upon which he informed the Court That the Lands in  Herefordshire  were rai∣sed Two Years Purchase since the Beginning of the War  When I had sent out my Summons to these Peo∣ple I gave at the same Time Orders to each of them to bring the several Ingredients he made use of in distinct Phials which they had done ac∣cordingly and ranged them into two Rows on each Side of the Court The Workmen were drawn up in Ranks behind them The Merchant informed me That in one Row of Phials were the several Colours they dealt in and in the other the Tasts He then showed me on the Right Hand one who went by the Name of  Tom Tintoret  who as he told me was the greatest Master in his Colouring of any Vintner in  London  To give me  a Proof of his Art he took a Glass of fair Water and by the Infusion of Three Drops out of one of his Phials converted it into a most beautiful pale  Burgundy  Two more of the same Kind heighten∣ed it into a perfect  Languedoc  From thence it pas∣sed into a florid  Hermitage  And after having gone through Two or Three other Changes by the Ad∣dition of a single Drop ended in a very deep  Pontack  This ingenious Vertuoso seeing me very much surprised at his Art told me That he had not an Opportunity of showing it in Perfection having only made use of Water for the GroundWork of his Colouring But that if I were to see an Operation upon Liquors of stronger Bodies the Art would appear to a much greater Advan∣tage He added That he doubted not but it would please my Curiosity to see the Cyder of one Apple take only a Vermilion when another with a less Quantity of the same Infusion would rise into a dark Purple according to the different Texture of Parts in the Liquor He informed me also That he could hit the different Shades and Degrees of Red as they appear in the Pink and the Rose the Clove and the Carnation as he had  Rhenish  or  Moselle Perry  or  White Port  to work in  I was so satisfied with the Ingenuity of this Vertuoso that after having advised him to quit so dishonest a Profession I promised him in Con∣sideration of his great Genius to recommend him as a Partner to a Friend of mine who has heaped up great Riches and is a Scarlet Dyer  The Artists on my other Hand were ordered in the Second Place to make some Experiments of their Skill before me Upon which the famous  Harry Sippet  stept out and asked me What I would be pleased to drink At the same Time he filled out Three or Four white Liquors in a Glass and told me That it should be what I pleased to tall for adding very learnedly That the Liquor  before him was as the naked Substance or First Matter of his Compound to which he and his Friend who stood overagainst him could give what Accidents or Form they pleased Finding him so great a Philosopher I desired he would convey into it the Qualities and Essence of right  Bourdeaux  Coming coming Sir said he with the Air of a Drawer and after having cast his Eye on the several Tasts and Flavours that stood before him he took up a little Cruit that was filled with a kind of Inky Juice and pour∣ing some of it out into the Glass of WhiteWine presented it to me and told me This was the Wine over which most of the Business of the last Term had been dispatched I must confess I looked upon that sooty Drug which he held up in his Cruit as the Quintessence of  English Bour∣deaux  and therefore desired him to give me a Glass of it by it self which he did with great Un∣willingness My Cat at that Time sat by me upon the Elbow of my Chair and as I did not care for making the Experiment upon my self I reached it to her to sip of it which had like to have cost her her Life for notwithstanding it flung her at first into freakish Tricks quite con∣trary to her usual Gravity in less than a quarter of an Hour she fell into Convulsions and had it not been a Creature more tenacious of Life than any other would certainly have died under the Operation  I was so incensed by the Tortures of my inno∣cent Domestick and the unworthy Dealings of these Men that I told them if each of them had as many Lives as the injured Creature before them they deserved to forfeit them for the per∣nicious Arts which they used for their Profit I therefore bid them look upon themselves as no better than as a kind of Assassins and Murderers within the Law However since they had dealt so clearly with me and laid before me their  whole Practice I dismissed them for that Time with a particular Request That they would not poison any of my Friends and Acquaintance and take to some honest Livelihood without Loss of Time  For my own Part I have resolved hereafter to be very careful in my Liquors and have agreed with a Friend of mine in the Army upon their next March to secure me Two Hogsheads of the best Stomach Wine in the Cellars of  Versailles  for the good of my Lucubrations and the Comfort of my old Age  The TATLER N  o    Habes Senectuti magnam Gratiam quae mihi Ser∣monis Aviditatem auxit Potionis Cibi sustu∣lit  Tull de Sen  From  Thursd Febr  to  Saturd Febr    SheerLane  February  AFter having applied my Mind with more than ordinary Attention to my Studies it is my usual Custom to relax and unbend it in the Conversation of such as are rather easy than shi∣ning Companions This I find particularly ne∣cessary for me before I retire to Rest in order to draw my Slumbers upon me by Degrees and fall asleep insensibly This is the particular Use I make of a Set of heavy honest Men with whom I have passed many Hours with much Indolence though not with great Pleasure Their Conver∣sation is a kind of Preparative for Sleep It takes the Mind down from its Abstractions leads it in∣to the familiar Traces of Thought and lulls it into  that State of Tranquility which is the Condition of a thinking Man when he is but half awake After this my Reader will not be surprised to hear the Account which I am about to give of a Club of my own Contemporaries among whom I pass Two or Three Hours every Evening This I look upon as taking my first Nap before I go to Bed The Truth of it is I should think my self unjust to Posterity as well as to the Society at the  Trumpet  of which I am a Member did not I in some Part of my Writings give an Account of the Persons among whom I have passed almost a Sixth Part of my Time for these last Forty Years Our Club consisted originally of Fifteen but partly by the Severity of the Law in arbitrary Times and partly by the natural Effects of old Age we are at present reduced to a Third Part of that Number In which however we have this Consolation That the best Company is said to consist of Five Persons I must confess besides the aforementioned Benefit which I meet with in the Conversation of this select Society I am not the less pleased with the Company in that I find my self the greatest Wit among them and am heard as their Oracle in all Points of Learning and Difficulty  Sir  Jeoffrey Notch  who is the oldest of the Club has been in Possession of the Right Hand Chair Time out of Mind and is the only Man among us that has the Liberty of stirring the Fire This our Foreman is a Gentleman of an ancient Family that came to a great Estate some Years before he had Discretion and run it out in Hounds Hor∣ses and Cockfighting for which Reason he looks upon himself as an honest worthy Gentle∣man who has had Misfortunes in the World and calls every thriving Man a pitiful Upstart  Major  Matchlock  is the next Senior who served in the last Civil Wars and has all the Battles by Heart He does not think any Action in  Europe  worth talking of since the Fight of  MarstonMoor  and every Night tells us of his having been knock'd off his Horse at the Rising of the  London  'Prentices for which he is in great Esteem amongst us  Honest old  Dick Reptile  is the Third of our So∣ciety He is a good natured indolent Man who speaks little himself but laughs at our Jokes and brings his young Nephew along with him a Youth of Eighteen Years old to show him good Company and give him a Tast of the World This young Fellow sits generally silent but when∣ever he opens his Mouth or laughs at any Thing that passes he is constantly told by his Uncle after a jocular Manner  "Ay ay  Jack  you young Men think us Fools but we old Men know you are'  The greatest Wit of our Company next to my self is a Bencher of the neighbouring Inn who in his Youth frequented the Ordinaries about  Cha∣ringCross  and pretends to have been intimate with  Jack Ogle  He has about Ten Distichs of  Hudibras  without Book and never leaves the Club till he has applied them all If any modern Wit be mentioned or any Town Frolick spoken of he shakes his Head at the Dulness of the pre∣sent Age and tells us a Story of  Jack Ogle  For my own Part I am esteemed among them because they see I am something respected by others though at the same Time I understand by their Behaviour that I am considered by them as a Man of a great deal of Learning but no Know∣ledge of the World insomuch that the Major sometimes in the Height of his Military Pride calls me the Philosopher And Sir  Jeoffrey  no lon∣ger ago than last Night upon a Dispute what Day of the Month it was then in  Holland  pulled his Pipe out of his Mouth and cried What does the Scholar say to it  Our Club meets precisely at Six a Clock in the Evening but I did not come last Night till Half an Hour after Seven by which Means I escaped the Battle of  Naseby  which the Major usually be∣gins at about Three Quarters after Six I found also That my good Friend the Bencher had al∣ready spent Three of his Distichs and only wait∣ing an Opportunity to hear a Sermon spoken of that he might introduce the Couplet where  aStick  rhimes to  Ecclesiastick  At my Entrance in∣to the Room they were naming a red Petticoat and a Cloak by which I found that the Ben∣cher had been diverting them with a Story of  Jack Ogle  I had no sooner taken my Seat but Sir  Jeoffrey  to show his good Will towards me gave me a Pipe of his own Tobacco and stirred up the Fire I lock upon it as a Point of Morality to be obliged by those who endeavour to oblige me and there∣fore in Requital for his Kindness and to set the Conversation a going I took the best Occasion I could to put him upon telling us the Story of old  Gantlett  which he always does with very parti∣cular Concern He traced up his Descent on both Sides for several Generations describing his Diet and Manner of Life with his several Battles and particularly that in which he fell This  Gantlett  was a GameCock upon whose Head the Knight in his Youth had won Five Hundred Pounds and lost Two Thousand This naturally set the Major upon the Account of  Edgehill  Fight and ended in a Duel of  Jack Ogle  's  Old  Reptile  was extremely attentive to all that was said tho' it was the same he had heard every Night for these Twenty Years and upon all Oc∣casions winked upon his Nephew to mind what passed  This may suffice to give the World a Tast of our innocent Conversation which we spun out till about Ten of the Clock when my Maid came  with a Lanthorn to light me Home I could not but reflect with my self as I was going out upon the talkative Humour of old Men and the little Figure which that Part of Life makes in one who cannot employ this natural Propensity in Discour∣ses which would make him venerable I must own it makes me very melancholy in Company when I hear a young Man begin a Story and have often observ'd That one of a Quarter of an Hour long in a Man of Five and twenty gathers Circumstances every Time he tells it till it grows into a long  Canterbury  Tale of two Hours by that Time he is Threescore  The only Way of avoiding such a trifling and frivolous old Age is to lay up in our Way to it such Stores of Knowledge and Observation as may make us useful and agreeable in our declining Years The Mind of Man in a long Life will become a Magazine of Wisdom or Folly and will consequently discharge it self in something im∣pertinent or improving For which Reason as there is nothing more ridiculous than an old tri∣fling StoryTeller so there is nothing more vene∣rable than one who has turned his Experience to the Entertainment and Advantage of Mankind  In short we who are in the last Stage of Life and are apt to indulge our selves in Talk ought to consider if what we speak be worth being heard and endeavour to make our Discourse like that of  Nastor  which Homer compares to the Flowing of Honey for its Sweetness  I am afraid I shall be thought guilty of this Excess I am speaking of when I cannot conclude without observing that  Milton  certainly thought of this Passage in Homer when in his Description of an eloquent Spirit he says  His Tongue drop'd Manna  The TATLER N  o    D  tacent Cla  ant  Tull  From  Saturd Feb  to  Tuesd Feb    SheerLane  February  SIlence is sometimes more significant and su∣blime than the most noble and most expres∣sive Eloquence and is on many Occasions the In∣dication of a great Mind Several Authors have treated of Silence as a Part of Duty and Discre∣tion but none of them have considered it in this Light Homer compares the Noise and Clamour of the  Trojans  advancing towards the Enemy to the Cackling of Cranes when they invade an Army of Pigmies On the contrary he makes his Countrymen and Favourites the  Greeks  move forward in a regular determined March and in the Depth of Silence I find in the Accounts which are given us of some of the more  ast  Nations where the Inhabitants are disposed by their Constitutions and Climates to higher Strains of Thought and more elevated Raptures than what we feel in the  Northern  Regions of the World That Silence is a Religious Exercise among them For when their publick Devotions are in the greatest Fervour and their Hearts lifted up as high as Words can raise them there are cer∣tain Suspensions of Sound and Motion for a Time in which the Mind is left to it self and supposed to swell with such secret Conceptions as are too big for Utterance I have my self been wonder∣fully delighted with a Masterpiece of Musick when in the very Tumult and Ferment of their Harmony all the Voices and Instruments have  stopped short on a sudden and after a little Pause recovered themselves again as it were and renew∣ed the Concert in all its Parts Methoughts this short Interval of Silence has had more Mufick in it than any the same Space of Time before or af∣ter it There are Two Instances of Silence in the Two greatest Poets that ever wrote which have something in them as sublime as any of the Speeches in their whole Works The First is that of  Ajax  in the Eleventh Book of the  Odys∣sy Ulysses  who had been the Rival of this great Man in his Life as well as the Occasion of his Death upon meeting his Shade in the Region of departed Heroes makes his Submission to him with an Humility next to Adoration which the other passes over with dumb sullen Majesty and such a Silence as to use the Words of  Longinus  had more Greatness in it than any Thing he could have spoken  The next Instance I shall mention is in  Virgil  where the Poet doubtless imitates this Silence of  Ajax  in that of  Dido  though I do not know that any of his Commentators have taken Notice of it  Aeneas  finding among the Shades of de∣spairing Lovers the Ghost of her who had lately died for him with the Wound still fresh upon her addresses himself to her with expanded Arms Floods of Tears and the most passionate Profes∣sions of his own Innocence as to what had hap∣pen'd all which  Dido  receives with the Dignity and Disdain of a resenting Lover and an injured Queen and is so far from vouchsafing him an Answer that she does not give him a single Look The Poet represents her as turning away her Face from him while he spoke to her and after ha∣ving kept her Eyes for some Time upon the Ground as one that heard and contemned his Protestations flying from him into the Grove of Myrtle and into the Arms of another whose Fi∣delity had deserved her Love  I have often thought our Writers of Tragedy have been very defective in this Particular and that they might have given great Beauty to their Works by certain Stops and Pauses in the Re∣presentation of such Passions as it is not in the Power of Language to express There is some∣thing like this in the last Act of  Venice Preserv'd  where  Pierre  is brought to an infamous Execu∣tion and begs of his Friend as a Reparation for past Injuries and the only Favour he could do him to rescue him from the Ignominy of the Wheel by stabbing him As he is going to make this dreadful Request he is not able to commu∣nicate it but withdraws his Face from his Friend's Ear and bursts into Tears The melan∣choly Silence that follows hereupon and conti∣nues till he has recovered himself enough to re∣veal his Mind to his Friend raises in the Specta∣tors a Grief that is inexpressible and an Idea of such a complicated Distress in the Actor as Words cannot utter It would look as ridiculous to many Readers to give Rules and Directions for proper Silences as for  Penning a Whisper  But it is certain that in the Extremity of most Passions particularly Surprise Admiration Astonishment nay Rage it self there is nothing more graceful than to see the Play stand still for a few Moments and the Audience fixed in an agreeable Suspence during the Silence of a skilful Actor  But Silence never shows it self to so great an Advantage as when it is made the Reply to Ca∣lumny and Defamation provided that we give no just Occasion for them We might produce an Example of it in the Behaviour of one in whom it appeared in all its Majesty and one whose Si∣lence as well as his Person was altogether Di∣vine When one considers this Subject only in its Sublimity this great Instance could not but occur to me and since I only make Use of it to show the highest Example of it I hope I do not offend  in it To forbear replying to an unjust Reproach and overlook it with a generous or if possible with an entire Neglect of it is one of the most heroick Acts of a great Mind And I must con∣fess when I reflect upon the Behaviour of some of the greatest Men in Antiquity I do not so much admire them that they deserved the Praise of the whole Age they lived in as because they con∣temned the Envy and Detraction of it  All that is incumbent on a Man of Worth who suffers under so ill a Treatment is to lie by for some Time in Silence and Obscurity till the Pre∣judice of the Times be over and his Reputation cleared I have often read with a great deal of Pleasure a Legacy of the famous Lord  Bacon  one of the greatest Genius's that our own or any Country has produced After having bequeathed his Soul Body and Estate in the usual Form he adds  'My Name and Memory I leave to Foreign Nations and to my Countrymen after some Time be passed over'  At the same Time that I recommend this Philo∣sophy to others I must confess I am so poor a Proficient in it my self that if in the Course of my Lucubrations it happens as it has done more than once that my Paper is duller than in Con∣science it ought to be I think the Time an Age till I have an Opportunity of putting out another and growing famous again for Two Days  I must not close my Discourse upon Silence without informing my Reader That I have by me an elaborate Treatise on the  Aposiopesis  called an  Et caetera  it being a Figure much used by some learned Authors and particularly by the great  Littleton  who as my Lord Chief Justice  Coke  ob∣serves had a most admirable Talent at an  c  ADVERTISEMENT  To oblige the Pretty Fellows and my Fair Rea∣ders I have thought fit to insert the whole Passage  abovementioned relating to  Dido  as it is transla∣ted by Mr  Dryden  Not far from thence the mournful Fields appear  So call'd from Lovers that inhabit there  The Souls whom that unhappy Flame invades  In Secret Solitude and Myrtle Shades  Make endless Means and pining with Desire  Lament too late their unextinguish'd Fire  Here  Procris Eryphile  here he found  Haring her Breast yet bleeding with the Wound  Made by her Son He saw  Pa  phae  there  With  Phaedra  's Ghost a foul incestuous Pair  There  Laodamia  with  Evadne  moves  Unhappy both but loyal in their Loves  Caeneus  a Woman once and once a Man  But ending in the Sex she first began  Not far from these  Phaenician Dido  stood  Fresh from her Wound her Bosom bath'd in Blood  Whom when the  Trojan  Here hardly knew  Obscure in Shades and with a doubtful View  Doubtful as he who runs thro' dusky Night  Or thinks he sees the Moon's uncertain Light  With Tears he first approach'd the sullen Shade  And as his Love inspir'd him thus he said  Unhappy Queen Then is the common Breath  Of Rumour true in your reported Death  And I alas the Cause By Heav'n I vow  And all the Powers that rule the Realms below  Unwilling I forsook your friendly State  Commanded by the Gods and forc'd by Fate  Th  se Gods that Fate whose unresisted Might  Have sent me to these Regions void of Light  Thro' the vast Empire of eternal Night  Nor dar'd I to presume that press'd with Grief  My Flight should urge you to this dire Relief  Stay stay your Steps and listen to my Vows  'Tis the last Interview that Fate allows  In vain he thus attempts her Mind to move  With Tears and Pray'rs and late repenting Love  Disdainfully she look'd then turning round  But fix'd her Eyes unmov'd upon the Ground  And what he says and swears regards no more  Than the deaf Rocks when the loud Billows rear  But whirl'd away to shun his hateful Sight  Hid in the Forrest and the Shades of Night  Then songht  Sicheus  thro' the shady Grove  Who answer'd all her Cares and equal'd all her Love  The TATLER N  o    Quis Talia fando  Myrmidonum Dolopu  ve aut duri Miles Ulyssei  Temperet a

seemed to me to strain his Voice more than ordi∣nary as if he designed to make himself heard to the remotest Corner of this Lane Having enter∣tained my self a little before I went to Bed with a Discourse on the Transmigration of Men into other Animals I could not but fancy that this was the Soul of some drowsy Bellman who used to sleep upon his Post for which he was con∣demned to do Pennance in Feathers and distin∣guish the several Watches of the Night under the Outside of a Cock While I was thinking of the Condition of this poor Bellman in Mas∣querade I heard a great Knocking at my Door and was soon after told by my Maid That my worthy Friend the tall black Gentleman who frequents the Coffeehouses hereabouts desired  to speak with me This ancient  Pythagorean  who has as much Honesty as any Man living but good Nature to an Excess brought me the following Petition which I am apt to believe he penned himself the Pititioner not being able to express his Mind in Paper under his present Form however famous he might have been for writing Verses when he was in his original Shape  To  Isaac Bickerstaff  Esq  Censor of  Great Britain  The humble Petition of  Job Chanticleer  in Behalf of himself and many other poor Sufferers in the same Condition  Sheweth  THat whereas your Petitioner is truly de∣scended of the ancient Family of the  Chanticleers  at  CockHall  near  Rumford  in  Essex  it has been his Misfortune to come into the mercenary Hands of a certain illdisposed Per∣son commonly called an  Higler  who under the close Confinement of a Pannier has con∣veyed him and many others up to  London  but hearing by Chance of your Worship's great Humanity towards RobinRedbreasts and TomTits he is embolden'd to beseech you to take his deplorable Condition into your tender Con∣sideration who otherwise must suffer with many Thousands more as innocent as himself that inhumane Barbarity of a  ShroveTuesday  Persecution We humbly hope that our Cou∣rage and Vigilance may plead for us on this Oc¦casion  Your poor Petitioner most earnestly implore  your immediate Protection from the Insolenc  of the Rabble the Batteries of Catsticks an  a painful lingering Death  And your Petitioner  c  From my Coup in  ClareMarket  Febr  Upon Delivery of this Petition the worthy Gentleman who presented it told me the Cu∣stoms of many wise Nations of the  East  through which he had travelled That nothing was more frequent than to see a Dervees lay out a whole Year's Income in the Redemption of Larks or Linets that had unhappily fallen into the Hands of BirdCatchers That it was also usual to run between a Dog and a Bull to keep them from hurting one another or to lose the Use of a Limb in parting a Couple of furious Mastiffs He then insisted upon the Ingratitude and Disin∣genuity of treating in this Manner a necessary and Domestick Animal that has made the whole House keep good Hours and called up the CookMaid for five Years together What would a  Turk  say continued he should he hear that it is a common Entertainment in a Nation which pretends to be one of the most ci∣vilized of  Europe  to tie an innocent Animal to a Stake and put him to an ignominious Death who has perhaps been the Guardian and Prove∣ditor of a poor Family as long as he was able to get Eggs for his Mistress  I thought what this Gentleman said was very reasonable and have often wondered that we do not lay aside a Custom which makes us appear barbarous to Nations much more rude and unpo∣lished than our selves Some  French  Writers have represented this Diversion of the common People much to our Disadvantage and imputed it to natural Fierceness and Cruelty of Temper as they do some other Entertainments peculiar to our Nation I mean those elegant Diversions of Bullbaiting and Prizefighting with the like ingenious Recreations of the BearGarden I wish I knew how to answer this Reproach which is cast upon us and excuse the Death of so many innocent Cocks Bulls Dogs and  Bears as have been set together by the Ears or died untimely Deaths only to make us Sport  It will be said That these are the Entertain∣ments of common People It is true but they are the Entertainments of no other common People Besides I am afraid there is a Tincture of the same savage Spirit in the Diversions of those of higher Rank and more refined Relish  Rapine  observes That the  English  Theatre very much delights in Bloodshed which he likewise represents as an Indication of our Tempers I must own there is something very horrid in the publick Executions of an  English  Tragedy Stab∣bing and Poisoning which are performed behind the Scenes in other Nations must be done openly among us to gratify the Audience  When poor  Sandford  was upon the Stage I have seen him groaning upon a Wheel stuck with Daggers impaled alive calling his Execu∣tioners with a dying Voice Cruel Dogs and Villains And all this to please his judicious Spectators who were wonderfully delighted with seeing a Man in Torment so well acted The Truth of it is the Politeness of our  English  Stage in Regard to  Decorum  is very extraordinary We act Murders to show our Intrepidity and Adulteries to show our Gallantry Both of them are frequent in our most taking Plays with this Difference only That the First are done in the Sight of the Audience and the other wrought up to such an Height upon the Stage that they are almost put in Execution before the Actors can get behind the Scenes  I would not have it thought that there is jus  Ground for those Consequences which our Ene∣mies draw against us from these Practises bu  methinks one would be sorry for any Manner o  Occasion for such Misrepresentations of us Th  Virtues of Tenderness Compassion and Huma¦nity are those by which Men are distinguish'  from Brutes as much as by Reason it self and it would be the greatest Reproach to a Nation to distinguish it self from all others by any De∣fect in these particular Virtues For which Rea∣sons I hope that my dear Countrymen will no longer expose themselves by an Effusion of Blood whether it be of Theatrical Heroes Cocks or any other innocent Animals which we are not obliged to slaughter for our Safety Convenience or Nourishment Where any of these Ends are not serv'd in the Destruction of a living Crea∣ture I cannot but pronounce it a great Piece of Cruelty if not a kind of Murder  The TATLER N  o    Quod si in hoc erro quod Animos Hominum im∣mortales esse credam libenter erro N  c mihi hunc Errorem quo delector dum vivo extor∣queri volo Sin Mortuus ut quidam Minuti

received give me Information That some welldis∣posed Persons have taken Offence at my using the Word FreeThinker as a Term of Reproach To set therefore this Matter in a clear Light I must declare That no one can have a greater Veneration than my self for the FreeThinkers of Antiquity who acted the same Part in those Times as the great Men of the Reformation did in several Nations of  Europe  by exerting them∣selves  against the Idolatry and Superstition of the Times in which they lived It was by this noble Impulse that  Socrates  and his Disciples as well as all the Philosophers of Note in  Greece  and  Cicero Seneca  with all the Learned Men of  Rome  endeavoured to enlighten their Contem∣poraries amidst the Darkness and Ignorance in which the World was then sunk and buried The great Points which these FreeThinkers en∣deavoured to establish and inculcate into the Minds of Men was the Formation of the Uni∣verse the Superintendency of Providence the Perfection of the Divine Nature the Immorta∣lity of the Soul and the future State of Rewards and Punishments They all complied with the Religion of their Country as much as possible in such Particulars as did not contradict and per∣vert these great and fundamental Doctrines of Mankind On the contrary the Persons who now set up for FreeThinkers are such as endea∣vour by a little Trash of Words and Sophistry to weaken and destroy those very Principles for the Vindication of which Freedom of Thought at first became laudable and heroick These Apostates from Reason and good Sense can look at the glorious Frame of Nature with∣out paying an Adoration to him that raised it can consider the great Revolutions in the Universe without lifting up their Minds to that Superior Power which hath the Direction of it can presume to censure the Deity in his Ways to∣wards Men can level Mankind with the Beasts that perish can extinguish in their own Minds all the pleasing Hopes of a future State and lull themselves into a stupid Security against the Terrors of it If one were to take the Word Priestcraft out of the Mouths of these shallow Monsters they would be immediately struck dumb It is by the Help of this single Term that they endeavour to disappoint the good  Works of the most Learned and Venerable Order of Men and harden the Hearts of the Igno∣rant against the very Light of Nature and the common received Notions of Mankind We ought not to treat such Miscreants as these upon the Foot of fair Disputants but to pour out Con∣tempt upon them and speak of them with Scorn and Infamy as the Pests of Society the Revilers of Humane Nature and the Blasphemers of a Being whom a good Man would rather die than hear dishonoured  Cicero  after having men∣tioned the great Heroes of Knowledge that re∣commended this Divine Doctrine of the Immor∣tality of the Soul calls those small Pretenders to Wisdom who declared against it certain  Minute  Philosophers using a Diminutive even of the Word Little to express the despicable Opinion he had of them The Contempt he throws up∣on them in another Passage is yet more remarka∣ble where to show the mean Thoughts he entertains of them he declares he would rather be in the Wrong with  Plato  than in the Right with such Company There is indeed nothing in the World so ridiculous as one of these grave Philosophical FreeThinkers that hath neither Passions nor Appetites to gratify no Heats of Blood nor Vigour of Constitution that can turn his Systems of Infidelity to his Advantage or raise Pleasures out of them which are incon∣sistent with the Belief of an Hereafter One that has neither Wit Gallantry Mirth or Youth to indulge by these Notions but only a poor joyless uncomfortable Vanity of distin∣guishing himself from the rest of Mankind is rather to be regarded as a Mischievous Luna∣tick than a mistaken Philosopher A chast In∣fidel a speculative Libertine is an Animal that I should not believe to be in Nature did I not sometimes meet with this Species of Men that plead for the Indulgence of their Passions in the  midst of a severe studious Life and talk a∣gainst the Immortality of the Soul over a Dish of Coffee  I would fain ask a  Minute  Philosopher What Good he proposes to Mankind by the publishing of his Doctrines Will they make a Man a bet∣ter Citizen or Father of a Family a more en∣dearing Husband Friend or Son Will they en∣large his publick or private Virtues or correct any of his Frailties or Vices What is there ei∣ther joyful or glorious in such Opinions Do they either refresh or enlarge our Thoughts Do they contribute to the Happiness or raise the Dignity of Humane Nature The only Good that I have ever heard pretended to is That they banish Terrors and set the Mind at Ease But whose Terrors do they banish It is certain if there were any Strength in their Arguments they would give great Disturbance to Minds that are influenc'd by Virtue Honour and Mora∣lity and take from us the only Comforts and Supports of Affliction Sickness and Old Age The Minds therefore which they set at Ease are only those of impenitent Criminals and Male∣factors and which to the Good of Mankind should be in perpetual Terror and Alarm  I must confess nothing is more usual than for a FreeThinker in Proportion as the Insolence of Scepticism is abated in him by Years and Know∣ledge or humbled and beaten down by Sorrow or Sickness to reconcile himself to the general Conceptions of reasonable Creatures so that we frequently see the Apostates turning from their Revolt toward the End of their Lives and employing the Refuse of their Parts in promoting those Truths which they had before endeavoured to invalidate  The History of a Gentleman in  France  is very well known who was so zealous a Promoter of  Infidelity that he had got together a select Com∣pany of Disciples and travelled into all Parts of the Kingdom to make Converts In the Midst of his fantastical Success he fell sick and was reclaimed to such a Sense of his Condition that after he had passed some Time in great Agonies and Horrors of Mind he begged those who had the Care of burying him to dress his Body in the Habit of a Capuchin that the Devil might not run away with it And to do further Justice upon himself desired 'em to tie an Halter about his Neck as a Mark of that ignominious Punishment which in his own Thoughts he had so justly deserved  I would not have Persecution so far disgraced as to wish these Vermin might be animadverted on by any Legal Penalties tho' I think it would be highly reasonable that those few of them who die in the Professions of their Infidelity should have such Tokens of Infamy fixed upon them as might distinguish those Bodies which are given up by the Owners to Oblivion and Putrefaction from those which rest in Hope and shall rise in Glory But at the same Time that I am against doing them the Honour of the Notice of our Laws which ought not to sup∣pose there are such Criminals in Being I have often wondered how they can be tolerated in any mixed Conversations while they are vent∣ing these absurd Opinions and should think that if on any such Occasion half a Dozen of the most roburst Christians in the Company would lead one of these Gentlemen to a Pump or convey him into a Blanket they would do very good Service both to Church and State I do not know how the Laws stand in this Parti∣cular but I hope whatever Knocks Bangs or Thumps might be given with such an honest Intention would not be construed as a Breach of the Peace I dare say they would not be  returned by the Person who receives them for whatever these Fools may say in the Vanity of their Hearts they are too wise to risque their Lives upon the Uncertainty of their Opinions  When I was a young Man about this Town I frequented the Ordinary of the  BlackHorse  in  Holbourn  where the Person that usually presided at the Table was a rough oldfashioned Gentle∣man who according to the Custom of those Times had been the Major and Preacher of a Regiment It happened one Day that a noisy young Officer bred in  France  was venting some newfrangled Notions and speaking in the Gaiety of his Humour against the Dispensations of Providence The Major at first only desired him to talk more respectfully of one for whom all the Company had an Honour but finding him run on in his Extravagance began to repri∣mand him after a more serious Manner Young Man said he do not abuse your Benefactor whilst you are eating his Bread Consider whose Air you breathe whose Presence you are in and who it is that gave you the Power of that very Speech which you make use of to his Dishonour The young Fellow who thought to turn Mat∣ters into a Jest asked him if he was going to preach But at the same Time desired him to take Care what he said when he spoke to a Man of Honour A Man of Honour says the Major Thou art an Infidel and a Blasphemer and I shall use thee as such In short the Quarrel ran so high that the Major was desired to walk out Upon their coming into the Garden the old Fellow advised his Antagonist to consider the Place into which one Pass might drive him but finding him grow upon him to a Degree of Scurrility as believing the Advice proceeded from Fear Sirrah says he If a Thunderbolt does not strike the dead before I come at thee I shall not fail to chastise thee for thy Profane∣ness  to thy Maker and thy Sawciness to his Ser∣vant Upon this he drew his Sword and cried out with a loud Voice  The Sword of the Lord and of Gideon  which so terrified his Antagonist that he was immediately disarmed and thrown upon his Knees In this Posture he begged his Life but the Major refused to grant it before he had asked Pardon for his Offence in a short extemporary Prayer which the old Gentleman dictated to him upon the Spot and which his Proselyte repeated after him in the Presence of the whole Ordinary that were now gathered about him in the Garden  The TATLER N  o    Deprendi miserum est Fabio vel judice vincam  Hor  From  Saturday Febr  to  Tuesday Febr    White's Chocolatehouse  February  The History of  Tom Varnish  BECAUSE I have a professed Aversion to long Beginnings of Stories I will go into this at once by telling you That there dwells near the  RoyalExchange  as happy a Couple as ever enter'd into Wedlock These live in that mutual Confidence of each other which renders the Satisfactions of Marriage even greater than those of Friendship and makes Wife and Hus∣band the dearest Appellations of Humane Life Mr  Ballance  is a Merchant of good Considera∣tion and understands the World not from Spe∣culation but Practice His Wife is the Daugh∣ter of an honest House ever bred in a FamilyWay and has from a natural good Understand∣ng and great Innocence a Freedom which  Men of Sense know to be the certain Sign of Virtue and Fools take to be an Encouragement to Vice  Tom Varnish  a young Gentleman of the  MiddleTemple  by the Bounty of a good Father who was so obliging as to die and leave him in his Twenty fourth Year besides a good Estate a large Sum which lay in the Hands of Mr  Bal∣lance  had by this Means an Intimacy at his House and being one of those hard Students who read Plays for Improvement in the Law took his Rules of Life from thence Upon mature Deliberation he conceived it very proper that he as a Man of Wit and Pleasure of the Town should have an Intrigue with his Merchant's Wife He no sooner thought of this Adventure but he began it by an amorous Epistle to the Lady and a faithful Promise to wait upon her at a certain Hour the next Evening when he knew her Husband was to be absent  The Letter was no sooner received but it was communicated to the Husband and produced no other Effect in him than that he joined with his Wife to raise all the Mirth they could out of this fantastical Piece of Gallantry They were so little concerned at this dangerous Man of Mode that they plotted Ways to perplex him without hurting him  Varnish  comes exactly at his Hour and the Lady's well acted Confusion at his En∣trance gave him Opportunity to repeat some Couplets very fit for the Occasion with very much Grace and Spirit His Theatrical Manner of making Love was interrupted by an Alarm of the Husband's coming and the Wife in a per∣sonated Terror beseeched him If he had any Value for the Honour of a Woman that loved him he would jump out of the Window He did so and fell upon FeatherBeds placed on purpose to receive him  It is not to be conceived how great the Joy of an amorous Man is when he has suffered for his Mistress and is never the worse for it  Varnish  the next Day writ a most elegant Billet where∣in he said all that Imagination could form upon the Occasion He violently protested going out of the Window was no Way terrible but as it was going from her with several other kind Ex∣pressions which procured him a Second Assigna∣tion Upon his second Visit he was conveyed by a faithful Maid into her BedChamber and left there to expect the Arrival of her Mistress But the Wench according to her Instructions ran in again to him and locked the Door after her to keep out her Master She had just Time enough to convey the Lover into a Chest be∣fore she admitted the Husband and his Wife into the Room  You may be sure that Trunk was absolutely necessary to be open'd but upon her Husband's ordering it she assured him she had taken all the Care imaginable in packing up the Things with her own Hand and he might send the Trunk aboard as soon as he thought fit The easie Husband believed his Wife and the good Couple went to Bed  Varnish  having the Hap∣piness to pass the Night in his Mistress's BedChamber without Molestation The Morning arose but our Lover was not well situated to ob∣serve her Blushes so that all we know of his Sentiments on this Occasion is That he heard  Ballance  ask for the Key and say he would himself go with this Chest and have it opened before the Captain of the Ship for the greater Safety of so valuable a Lading  The Goods were hoisted away and Mr  Bal∣lance  marching by his Chest with great Care and Diligence omitted nothing that might give his Passenger Perplexity But to consummate all he delivered the Chest with strict Charge  in case they were in Danger of being taken to throw it overboard for there were Letters in it the Matter of which might be of great Service to the Enemy  N B  It is not thought advisable to proceed further in this Account Mr  Varnish  being just returned from his Travels and willing to con∣ceal the Occasion of his first applying himself to the Languages  St

with one Friend others when there is a large Number I found  Dick  to be of the former Kind He was bewailing to me in very just Terms the Offences which he frequently met with in the Abuse of Speech Some use Ten Times more Words than they need some put in Words quite foreign to their Purpose and others adorn their Discourses with Oaths and Blasphemies by Way of Tropes and Figures What my good Friend started dwelt upon me after I came Home this Evening and led me into an Enquiry with my self Whence should arise such strange Excrescencies in Dis∣course Whereas it must be obvious to all rea∣sonable Beings That the sooner a Man speaks his Mind the more complaisant he is to the Man with whom he talks But upon mature Delibe∣ration I am come to this Resolution That for One Man who speaks to be understood there are Ten who talk only to be admired  The ancient  Greeks  had little independent Sylla∣bles called Expletives which they brought into their Discourses both in Verse and Prose for no other Purpose but for the better Grace and Sound of their Sentences and Periods I know no Ex∣ample but this which can authorise the Use of  more Words than are necessary But whether it be from this Freedom taken by that wise Nation or however it arises  Dick Reptile  hit upon a very just and common Cause of Offence in the Generality of the People of all Orders We have one here in our Lane who speaks nothing without quoting an Authority for it is always with him So and so  as the Man said  He asked me this Morning How I did  as the Man said  and hoped I would come now and then to see him  as the Man said  I am acquainted with another who never deli∣vers himself upon any Subject but he cries He only speaks his  poor Judgment  this is his hum∣ble Opinion or as for his Part if he might pre∣sume to offer any Thing on that Subject But of all the Persons who add Elegancies and Superflui∣ties to their Discourses those who deserve the foremost Rank are the Swearers and the Lump of these may I think be very aptly divided into the common Distinction of High and Low Dulness and Barrenness of Thought is the Original of it in both these Sects and they differ only in Con∣stitution The Low is generally a phlegmatick and the High a cholerick Coxcomb The Man of Phlegm is sensible of the Emptiness of his Discourse and will tell you That  Psackins  such a Thing is true Or if you warm him a little he may run into Passion and cry  Odsbodikins  you do not say right But the High affects a Sublimity in Dulness and invokes Hell and Dam∣nation at the Breaking of a Glass or the Slow∣ness of a Drawer  I was the other Day trudging along  Fleetstreet  on Foot and an old ArmyFriend came up with me We were both going towards  Westminster  and finding the Streets were so crowded that we could not keep together we resolved to club for a Coach This Gentleman I knew to be the First of the Order of the Cholerick I must con∣fess were there no Crime in it nothing could  be more diverting than the Impertinence of the High Juror For whether there is Remedy or not against what offends him still he is to show he is offended and he must sure not omit to be magnificently passionate by falling on all Things in his Way We were stopped by a Train of Coaches at  TempleBar  What the Devil says my Companion cannot you drive on Coachman Dn you all for a Set of Sons of Whores

your Ears off you Fellow before thereCome hither you Dog you and let me ring your Neck round your Shoulders We had a Repetition of the same Eloquence at the  Cockpit  and the Turning into  PalaceYard  This gave me a perfect Image of the Insignifi∣cancy of the Creatures who practise this Enor∣mity and made me conclude That it is ever Want of Sense makes a Man guilty in this Kind It was excellently well said That this Folly had no Temptation to excuse it no Man being born of a Swearing Constitution In a Word a few rumbling Words and Consonants clapped toge∣ther without any Sense will make an accom∣plished Swearer And it is needless to dwell long upon this Blustring Impertinence which is already banished out of the Society of wellbred  Men and can be useful only to Bullies and ill Tragick Writers who would have Sound and Noise pass for Courage and Sense  St James's Coffeehouse  Feb  There arrived a Messenger last Night from  Har∣wich  who left that Place just as the Duke of  Marlborough  was going on board The Character of this important General going out by the Com∣mand of his Queen and at the Request of his Country put me in Mind of that noble Figure which  Shakespear  gives  Harry  the Fifth upon his Expedition against  France  The Poet wishes for Abilities to represent so great an Hero  Oh for a Muse of Fire  says he  Then should the Warlike  Harry  like himself  Assume the Port of  Mars  and at his Heels  Leash'd in like Hounds should Famine Sword and Fire  Crouch for Employments  A Conqueror drawn like the God of Battle with such a dreadful Leash of Hellhounds at his Command makes a Picture of as much Ma∣jesty and Terror as is to be met with in any Poet  Shakespear  understood the Force of this parti∣cular Allegory so well that he had it in his Thoughts in another Passage which is altogether as Daring and Sublime as the former What I mean is in the Tragedy of  Julius Caesar  where  Antony  after having foretold the Bloodshed and Destruction that should be brought upon the Earth by the Death of that great Man to fill up the Horror of his Description adds the follow∣ing Verses  And  Caesar  's Spirit ranging for Revenge  With  Ate  by his Side come hot from Hell  Shall in these Confines with a Monarch's Voice  Cry  Havock  and let slip the Dogs of War  I do not question but these Quotations will call to Mind in my Readers of Learning

Spi∣rit in a Man to be able to disengage himself from the Opinions of others so far as not to let the Deference due to the Sense of Mankind in∣snare him to act against the Dictates of his own Reason But the Generality of the World are so far from walking by any such Maxim that it is almost a standing Rule to do as others do or be ridiculous I have heard my old Friend Mr  Hart  speak it as an Observation among the Players That it is impossible to act with Grace except the Actor has forgot that he is before an Audience Till he has arrived at that his Motion his Air his every Step and Gesture has something in them which discovers he is under a Restraint for Fear of being ill received or if he considers himself as in the Presence of those who approve his Behaviour you see an Affectation of that Pleasure run through his whole Carriage It is as common in Life as upon the Stage to behold a Man in the most indifferent Action betray a Sense he has of doing what he is about gracefully Some have such an immoderate Relish for Ap∣plause that they expect it for Things which in themselves are so frivolous that it is impossible without this Affectation to make them appear worthy either of Blame or Praise There is  Will Glare  so passionately intent upon being admired  that when you see him in publick Places every Muscle of his Face discovers his Thoughts are fixed upon the Consideration of what Figure he makes He will often fall into a musing Posture to attract Observation and is then obtruding himself upon the Company when he pretends to be withdrawn from it Such little Arts are the certain and infallible Tokens of a superficial Mind as the avoiding Observation is the Sign of a great and sublime one It is therefore extreme∣ly difficult for a Man to judge even of his own Actions without forming to himself an Idea of what he should act were it in his Power to exe∣cute all his Desires without the Observation of the rest of the World There is an Allegorical Fable in  Plato  which seems to admonish us That we are very little acquainted with our selves while we know our Actions are to pass the Cen∣sures of others but had we the Power to accom∣plish all our Wishes unobserved we should then easily inform our selves how far we are possessed of Real and Intrinsick Virtue The Fable I was go∣ing to mention is that of  Gyges  who is said to have had an inchanted Ring which had in it a miraculous Quality making him who wore it visible or invisible as he turned it to or from his Body The Use  Gyges  made of his occasional In∣visibility was by the Advantage of it to vio∣late a Queen and murder a King  Tully  takes Notice of this Allegory and says very handsom∣ly That a Man of Honour who had such a Ring would act just in the same Manner as he would do without it It is indeed no small Pitch of Virtue under the Temptation of Impunity and the Hopes of accomplishing all a Man's Desires not to transgress the Rules of Justice and Virtue but this is rather not being an ill Man than be∣ing positively a good one and it seems wonder∣ful that so great a Soul as that of  Tully  should not form to himself a Thousand worthy Actions  which a virtuous Mind would be prompted to by the Possession of such a Secret There are cer∣tainly some Part of Mankind who are Guardian Beings to the other  Sallust  could say of  Cato That he had rather be than appear good  but in∣deed this Eulogium rose no higher than as I just now hinted to an Inoffensiveness rather than an active Virtue Had it occurred to the noble Ora∣tor to represent in his Language the glorious Pleasures of a Man secretly employed in Benefi∣cence and Generosity it would certainly have made a more charming Page than any he has now left behind him How might a Man fur∣nished with  Gyges  's Secret employ it in bringing together distant Friends laying Snares for crea∣ting Goodwill in the room of groundless Hatred in removing the Pangs of an unjust Jealousy the Shyness of an imperfect Reconciliation and the Tremor of an awful Love Such a one could give Confidence to bashful Merit and Confusion to overbearing Impudence  Certain it is That secret Kindnesses done to Mankind are as beautiful as secret Injuries are detestable To be invisibly good is as Godlike as to be invisibly ill Diabolical As degenerate as we are apt to say the Age we live in is there are still amongst us Men of illustrious Minds who enjoy all the Pleasures of good Actions except that of being commended for them There happens among others very worthy Instan∣ces of a publick Spirit one of which I am obli∣ged to discover because I know not otherwise how to obey the Commands of the Benefactor A Citizen of  London  has given Directions to Mr  Rainer  the Writing Master of  Paul  's School to educate

Notice thereof to  Mr  Morphew  or Mr  Lillie  and they shall if properly qualified have Instructions accordingly  Actions of this Kind have in them something so transcendent that it is an Injury to applaud them and a Diminution of that Merit which consists in shunning our Approbation We shall therefore leave them to enjoy that glorious Ob∣scurity and silently admire their Virtue who can contemn the most delicious of Humane Plea∣sures that of receiving due Praise Such Cele∣stial Dispositions very justly suspend the Dis∣covery of their Benefactions till they come where their Actions cannot be

est quod credere de se  Non possit cum laudatur Diis aequa Potestas  Juv  From  Saturd Febr  to  Tuesd Febr    SheerLane  February  WHEN I reflect upon the many Nights I have sat up for some Months last past in the greatest Anxiety for the Good of my Neigh∣bours and Contemporaries it is no small Discou∣ragement to me to see how slow a Progress I make in the Reformation of the World But in∣deed I must do my Female Readers the Justice to own that their tender Hearts are much more susceptible of good Impressions than the Minds of the other Sex Business and Ambition take up Men's Thoughts too much to leave Room for Philosophy But if you speak to Women in a Style and Manner proper to approach them they never fail to improve by your Counsel I shall therefore for the future turn my Thoughts more particularly to their Service and study the best Methods to adorn their Persons and inform their Minds in the justest Methods to make them what  Nature designed them the most beauteous Ob∣jects of our Eyes and the most agreeable Com∣panions of our Lives But when I say this I must not omit at the same Time to look into their Errors and Mistakes that being the readiest Way to the intended End of adorning and in∣structing them It must be acknowledged That the very Inadvertencies of this Sex are owing to the other for if Men were not Flatterers Wo∣men could not fall into that general Cause of all their Follies and our Misfortunes their Love of Flattery Were the Commendation of these a∣greeable Creatures built upon its proper Founda∣tion the higher we raised their Opinion of them∣selves the greater would be the Advantage to our Sex but all the Topick of Praise is drawn from very senseless and extravagant Idea's we pretend we have of their Beauty and Perfection Thus when a young Man falls in Love with a young Woman from that Moment she is no more Mrs  Alice  such a one born of such a Fa∣ther and educated by such a Mother but from the first Minute that he cast his Eye upon her with Desire he conceives a Doubt in his Mind What Heavenly Power gave so unexpected a Blow to an Heart that was ever before untouched But who can resist Fate and Destiny which are lodged in Mrs  Alice  's Eyes After which he de∣sires Orders accordingly Whether he is to live or breath the Smile or Frown of his Goddess is the only Thing that can now either save or de∣stroy him By this Means the wellhumoured Girl that would have romped with him before she received this Declaration assumes a State suitable to the Majesty he has given her and treats him as the Vassal he calls himself The Girl's Head is immediately turned by having the Power of Life and Death and takes Care to suit every Motion and Air to her new Sovereignty After he has placed himself at this Distance he  must never hope to recover his former Familiarity till she has had the Addresses of another and found them less sincere  If the Application to Women were justly turn∣ed the Address of Flattery tho' it implied at the same Time an Admonition would be much more likely to succeed Should a captivated Lover in a Billet let his Mistress know That her Piety to her Parents her Gentleness of Behaviour her prudent Oeconomy with respect to her own lit∣tle Affairs in a Virgin Condition had improved the Passion which her Beauty had inspired him with into so settled an Esteem for her that of all Women breathing he wished her his Wifes tho' his commending her for Qualities she knew she had as a Virgin would make her believe he expected from her an answerable Conduct in the Character of a Matron I will answer for it his Suit would be carried on with less Perplexity  Instead of this the Generality of our young Women taking all their Notions of Life from gay Writings or Letters of Love consider them∣selves as Goddesses Nymphs and Shepherdes∣ses  By this Romantick Sense of Things all the na∣tural Relations and Duties of Life are forgotten and our Female Part of Mankind are bred and treated as if they were designed to inhabit the happy Fields of  Arcadia  rather than be Wives and Mothers in old  England  It is indeed long since I had the Happiness to converse familiarly with this Sex and therefore have been fearful of falling into the Error which recluse Men are very subject to that of giving false Representa∣tions of the World from which they have retired by imaginary Schemes drawn from their own Re∣flections An old Man cannot easily gain Admit∣tance into the Dressingroom of Ladies I therefore thought it Time well spent to turn over  Agrippa  and use all my occult Art to give my old Co  ∣nelian  Ring the same Force with that of  Gyges  which I have lately spoken of By the Help of this I went unobserved to a Friend's House of mine and followed the Chambermaid invisibly about Twelve of the Clock into the Bedchamber of the beauteous  Flavia  his Fine Daughter just before she got up  I drew the Curtains and being wrapped up in the Safety of my old Age could with much Pleasure without Passion behold her sleeping with  Waller  's Poems and a Letter fixed in that Part of him where every Woman thinks her self described The Light flashing upon her Face awakened her She opened her Eyes and her Lips too repeating that Piece of false Wit in that admired Poet  Such  Helen  was And who can blame the Boy  That in so bright a Flame consum'd his  Troy  This she pronounced with a most bewitching Sweetness but after it fetched a Sigh that me∣thought had more Desire than Languishment then took out her Letter and read aloud for the Pleasure I suppose of hearing soft Words in Praise of her self the following Epistle  Madam  I Sat near you at the Opera last Night but knew no Entertainment from the vain Show and Noise about me while I waited wholly intent upon the Motion of your Bright Eyes in Hopes of a Glance that might restore me to the Pleasures of Sight and Hearing in the midst of Beauty and Harmony It is said the Hell of the Accursed in the next Life arises from an Incapacity to partake the Joys of the Blessed though they were to be admitted to them Such I am sure was my Condition all this Evening and if you my Deity cannot have so much Mercy as to make me by your Influence capable of tasting  the Satisfactions of Life my Being is ended which consisted only in your Favour  The Letter was hardly read over when she rush'd out of Bed in her WrappingGown and consulted her Glass for the Truth of his Passion She raised her Head and turned it to a Profile repeating the last Lines  My Being is ended which consisted only in your Favour  The Goddess imme∣diately called her Maid and fell to dressing that mischievous Face of hers without any Manner of Consideration for the Mortal who had offered up his Petition Nay it was so far otherwise that the whole Time of her Woman's combing her Hair was spent in Discourse of the Imper∣tinence of his Passion and ended in declaring a Resolution if she ever had him to make him wait She also frankly told the Favourite Gypsy that was prating to her that her passionate Lo∣ver had put it out of her Power to be civil to him if she were inclined to it for said she if I am thus Coelestial to my Lover he will cer∣tainly so far think himself disappointed as I grow into the Familiarity and Form of a mortal Woman  I came away as I went in without staying for other Remarks than what confirmed me in the Opinion That it is from the Notions the Men inspire them with that the Women are so fanta∣stical in the Value of themselves This ima∣ginary Preeminence which is given to the Fair Sex is not only form'd from the Addresses of People of Condition but it is the Fashion and Humour of all Orders to go regularly out of their Wits as soon as they begin to make Love I know at this Time Three Goddesses in the  NewExchange  and

Bickerstaff  's Pardon for ma∣king a Doubt and impute it to my Ignorance and most humbly crave That he would be pleased to give Notice in his  Tatler  when he thinks fit whether his Nomination of Ten Boys be disposed of or whether there be Room for Two Boys to be recommended to him and that he will permit the Writer of this to present him with Two Boys who it is humbly presumed will be judged to be very remarkable Objects of such Charity  SIR  Your most humble Servant  I am to tell this Gentleman in sober Sadness and without Jest That there really is so good and charitable a Man as the Benefactor enquired for in his Letter and that there are but Two Boys yet named The Father of one of them was killed at  Bleinheim  the Father of the other at  Almanza  I do not here give the Names of the Children because I should take it to be an Insolence in me to publish them in a Charity which I have only the Direction of as a Servant to that worthy and generous Spirit who bestows upon them this Bounty without laying the Bon∣dage of an Obligation What I have to do is to tell them they are beholden only to their Maker to kill in them as they grow up the false Shame of Poverty and let them know That their present Fortune which is come upon them by the Loss of their poor Fathers on so glorious Occasions is much more honourable than the Inheritance of the most ample illgotten Wealth  The next Letter which lies before me is from a Man of Sense who strengthens his own Au∣thority with that of  Tully  in perswading me to what he very justly believes one cannot be averse  London  Feb  Mr  Bickerstaff  I am so confident of your Inclination to pro∣mote any Thing that is for the Advance∣ment of liberal Arts that I lay before you the following Translation of a Paragraph in  Cicero  's Oration in Defence of  Archias  the Poet as an Incentive to the agreeable and instructive Read∣ing of the Writings of the  Augustan  Age Most Vices and Follies proceed from a Man's Incapacity of entertaining himself and we are generally Fools in Company because we dare not be wise alone I hope on some future Oc∣casions you will find this no barren Hint  Tully  after having said very handsome Things of his Client commends the Arts of which he was Master as follows  If so much Profit be not reaped in the Study of Letters and if Pleasure only be found yet in my Opinion this Relaxation of the Mind should be esteemed most humane and ingenuous Other Things are not for all Ages Places and Seasons These Studies form Youth delight Old Age adorn Prosperity and soften and even re∣move Adversity entertain at Home and no Hindrance Abroad don't leave us at Night and keep us Company on the Road and in the Country I am  Your Humble Servant  STREPHON  The following Epistle seems to want the quickest Dispatch because a Lady is every Mo∣ment offended till it is answered which is best done by letting the Offender see in her own Let∣ter how tender she is of calling him so  SIR  THIS comes from a Relation of yours tho' unknown to you who besides the Tie of Consanguinity has some Value for you on the Account of your Lucubrations those being designed to refine our Conversation as well as cultivate our Minds I humbly beg the Favour of you in one of your  Tatlers  after what Manner you please to correct a parti∣cular Friend of mine for an Indecorum he is guilty of in Discourse of calling his Acquain∣tance when he speaks of them Madam As for Example my Cousin  Jenny Distaff  Madam  Distaff  which I am sure you are sensible is very unpolite and 'tis what makes me often uneasy for him though I cannot tell him of it my self which makes me guilty of this Presumption that I depend upon your Goodness to excuse and I do assure you the Gentleman will mind your Reprehension for he is as I am  SIR  Your most humble Servant and Cousin  Dorothy Drumstick  I write this in a thin UnderPetticoat and ne∣ver did or will wear a Fardingal  I had no sooner read the just Complaint of Mrs  Drumstick  but I received an urgent One from another of the Fair Sex upon Faults of more pernicious Consequence  Mr  Bickerstaff  OBserving that you are entered into a Cor∣respondence with  Pasquin  who is I sup∣pose a RomanCatholick I beg of you to for∣bear giving him any Account of our Religion or Manners till you have rooted out certain Misbehaviours even in our Churches Among others that of Bowing Saluting taking Snuff  and other Gestures Lady  Autumn  made me a very low Courtesy the other Day from the next Pew and with the most courtly Air ima∣ginable called her self  Miserable Sinner  Her Neece soon after in saying  Forgive us our Trespasses  courtesy'd with a gloting Look at my Brother He returned it opening his Snuff∣box and repeating yet a more solemn Expression I beg of you good Mr  Gensor  not to tell  Pasquin  any Thing of this Kind and to believe this does not come from one of a morose Tem∣per mean Birth rigid Education narrow For∣tune or Bigottry in Opinion or from one in whom Time had worn out all Taste of Pleasure I assure you it is far otherwise for I am pos∣sessed of all the contrary Advantages and hope Wealth good Humour and good Breed∣ing may be best employed in the Service of Religion and Virtue and desire you would as soon as possible remark upon the above∣mentioned Indecorums that we may not longer transgress against the latter to preserve our Reputation in the former  Your humble Servant  LIDIA  The last Letter I shall insert is what follows This is written by a very inquisitive Lady and I think such Interrogative Gentlewomen are to be answered no other Way than by Interrogation Her Billet is this  Dear Mr  Bickerstaff  Are you quite as good as you seem to be  Chloe  To which I can only answer  Dear  Chloe  Are you quite as ignorant as you seem to be  I B  The TATLER N  o    From  Thursd March  to  Saturd March    SheerLane  March  WHILE the Attention of the Town is drawn aside from the reading us Writers of News we all save our selves against it is at more Leisure As for my own Part I shall still let the labouring Oar be managed by my Correspondents and fill my Paper with their Sentiments rather than my own 'till I find my Readers more disengaged than they are at pre∣sent When I came Home this Evening I found several Letters and Petitions which I shall in∣sert with no other Order than as I accidentally opened them as follows  March  SIR  HAving a Daughter about Nine Years of Age I would endeavour she might have Education I mean such as may be useful as working well and a good Deportment In order to it I am persuaded to place her at some BoardingSchool situate in a good Air My Wife opposes it and gives for her greatest Reason That she is too much a Woman and understands the Formalities of Visiting and a TeaTable so very nicely that none tho' much older can exceed her and with all these Perfections the Girl can scarce thread a  Needle But however after several Argu∣ments we have agreed to be decided by your Judgment and knowing your Abilities shall manage our Daughter exactly as you shall please to direct I am serious in my Request and hope you will be so in your Answer which will lay a deep Obligation upon  SIR  Your humble Servant  T T  Sir pray answer it in your  Tatler  that it may be serviceable to the Publick  I am as serious on this Subject as my Correspon∣dent can be and am of Opinion That the great Happiness or Misfortune of Mankind depends up∣on the Manner of Educating and Treating that Sex I have lately said I design to turn my Thoughts more particularly to them and their Service I beg therefore a little Time to give my Opinion on so important a Subject and de∣sire the young Lady may fill Tea one Week longer till I have considered whether she shall be removed or not  ChanceryLane  Febr  Mr  Bickerstaff  YOUR Notice in the Advertisement in your  Tatler  of  Saturday  last about  Whet∣ters  in and about the  RoyalExchange  is migh∣tily taken Notice of by Gentlemen who use the Coffeehouses near the  ChanceryOffice  in  Chan∣ceryLane  and there being a particular cer∣tain Set of both young and old Gentlemen that belong to and near adjoining to the  Chan∣ceryOffice  both in  ChanceryLane  and  BellYard  that are not only  Whetters  all the Morning long but very Musically given about Twelve at Night the same Days and mightily taken with the Union of the Dulcimer Violin and Song at which Recreation they rejoice together with  perfect Harmony however their Clients dis∣agree You are humbly desired by several Gentlemen to give some Regulation concerning them in which you will contribute to the Re∣pose of us who are  Your very humble Servants  L T N F T W  These  Whetters  are a People I have considered with much Pains aad find them to differ from a Sect I have heretofore spoken of called  SnuffTakers  only in the Expedition they take in de∣stroying their Brains The  Whetter  is obliged to refresh himself every Moment with a Liquor as the  Snuff Taker  with a Powder As for their Harmony in the Evening I have nothing to ob∣ject provided they remove to  Wapping  or the  BridgeFoot  where it is not to be supposed that their Vociferations will annoy the Studious the Busie or the Contemplative I once had Lodg∣ings in  GraysInn  where we had two hard Stu∣dents who learned to play upon the Hautboy and I had a Couple of ChamberFellows over my Head not less diligent in the Practice of BackSword and SingleRapier I remember these Gentlemen were assigned by the Benchers the Two Houses at the End of the TerrasWalk as the only Places sit for their Meditations Such Students as will let none improve but them∣selves ought indeed to have their proper Di∣stances from Societies  The Gentlemen of loud Mirth abovemen∣tioned I take to be in the Quality of their Crime the same as EvesDroppers for they who will be in your Company whether you will or no are to as great a Degree Offen∣ders as they who hearken to what passes with∣out being of your Company at all The ancient Punishment for the latter when I first came to  this Town was the Blanket which I humbly conceive may be as justly applied to him that bawls as to him that listens It is therefore provided for the future That except in the long Vacation no Retainers to the Law with Dulcimer Violin or any other Instrument in any Tavern within a Furlong of an Inn of Court shall sing any Tune or pretended Tune whatso∣ever upon Pain of the Blanker to be admini∣stred according to the Discretion of all such peaceable People as shall be within the Annoy∣ance And it is further directed That all Clerks who shall offend in this Kind shall forfeit their Indentures and be turned over as Assistants to the Clerks of Parishes within the Bills of Mortality who are hereby empowered to de∣mand them accordingly  I am not to omit the Receipt of the following Letter with a Nightcap from my Valentine which Nightcap I find was finished in the Year and is too finely wrought to be of any mo∣dern Stitching Its Antiquity will better appear by my Valentine's own Words  SIR  SInce you are pleased to accept of so mean a Present as a Nightcap from your Valentine I have sent you one which I do assure you has been very much esteemed of in our Family for my Great Grandmother's Daughter who worked it was Maid of Honour to Queen  Eli∣zabeth  and had the Misfortune to lose her Life by pricking her Finger in the making of it of which she bled to Death as her Tomb now at  West minster  will shew For which Reason my self nor none of my Family have loved Work ever since otherwise you should have had one as you desired made by the Hands of  SIR  Your affectionate Valentine  To the Right Worshipful  Isaac Bickerstaff  Esq  Censor of  Great Britain  and Governor of the Hospital erected or to be erected in  Moorfields  The Petition of the Inhabitants of the Parish of  Goatham  in the County of  Middlesex  Humbly sheweth  THAT whereas 'tis the undoubted Right of your said Petitioners to repair on every Lord'sDay to a Chapel of Ease in the said Pa∣rish there to be instructed in their Duties in the known or vulgar Tongue yet so it is may it please your Worship that the Preacher of the said Chapel has of late given himself wholly up to Matters of Controversy in no wise tending to the Edification of your said Petitioners and in handling as he calls it the same has used divers hard and crabbed Words such as among many others are  Or∣thodox  and  Heterodox  which are in no sort under∣stood by your said Petitioners and 'tis with Grief of Heart that your Petitioners beg Leave to re∣present to you that in mentioning the aforesaid Words or Names the latter of which as we have Reason to believe is his deadly Enemy he will fall into Ravings and Foamings ill∣becoming the Meekness of his Office and tending to give Offence and Scandal to all good People  Your Petitioners further say That they are ready to prove the aforesaid Allegations and therefore humbly hope that from a true Sense of their Condition you will please to receive the said Preacher into the Hospital 'till he shall recover a right Use of his Senses  And your Petitioners  c  The TATLER N  o    From  Saturd March  to  Tuesd March    SheerLane  March  ALL Persons who employ themselves in Pub∣lick are still interrupted in the Course of their Affairs And it seems the admired Cavalier  Nicolini  himself is commanded by the Ladies who at present employ their Time with great Assiduity in the Care of the Nation to put off his Day till he shall receive their Commands and Notice that they are at Leisure for Diversions In the mean Time it is not to be expressed how many cold Chickens the Fair Ones have eaten since this Day Sevennight for the Good of their Country This great Occasion has given Birth to many Discoveries of high Moment for the Conduct of Life There is a Toast of my Ac∣quaintance told me She had now found out that it was Day before Nine in the Morning and I am very confident if the Affair holds many Days longer the Ancient Hours of Eating will be revived among us many having by it been made acquainted with the Luxury of Hunger and Thirst  There appears methinks something very vene∣rable in all Assemblies And I must confess I en∣vied all who had Youth and Health enough to make their Appearance there that they had the Happiness of being a whole Day in the best Company in the World During the Adjourn∣ments of that awful Court a Neighbour of mine was telling me That it gave him a Notion of the ancient Grandeur of the  English  Hospita∣lity  to see  WestminsterHall  a DiningRoom There is a Chearfulness at such Repasts which is very delightful to Tempers which are so happy as to be clear of Spleen and Vapour for to the Jovial to see others pleased is the greatest of all Pleasures  But since Age and Infirmities forbid my Ap∣pearance at such publick Places the next Hap∣piness is to make the best Use of Privacy and acquit my self of the Demands of my Corres∣pondents The following Letter is what has given me no small Inquietude it being an Ac∣cusation of Partiality and Disregard to Merit in the Person of a Vertuoso who is the most elo∣quent of all Men upon small Occasions and is the more to be admired for his prodigious Ferti∣lity of Invention which never appears but upon Subjects which others would have thought bar∣ren But in Consideration of his uncommon Talents I am contented to let him be the Hero of my next Two Days by inserting his Friend's Recommendation of him at large  Nando's  Febr  Dear Cousin  I Am just come out of the Country and up∣on perusing your late Lucubrations I find  Charles Lillie  to be the Darling of your Affe∣ctions that you have give him a Place and taken no small Pains to establish him in the World and at the same Time  ave passed by his Namesake at this End of the Town as if he was a Citizen defunct and one of no Use in a Commonwealth I must own his Cir∣cumstances are so good and so well known that he does not stand in Need of having his Fame published to the World but being of an ambitious Spirit and an aspiring Soul he would be rather proud of the Honour than de∣sirous of the Profit which might result from your Recommendation He is a Person of a  particular Genius the First that brought Toys in Fashion and Bawbles to Perfection He is admirably well versed in Screws Springs and Hinges and deeply read in Knives Combs or Scissars Buttons or Buckles He is a perfect Master of Words which uttered with a smooth voluble Tongue flow into a most persuasive Eloquence insomuch that I have known a Gentleman of Distinction find several ingenious Faults with a Toy of his and shew his utmost Dislike to it as being either useless or ill con∣trived but when the Orator behind the Counter had harangued upon it for an Hour and a half display'd its hidden Beauties and revealed its secret Perfections he has wondered how he had been able to spend so great a Part of his Life without so important an Utensil I won't pretend to furnish out an Inventory of all the valuable Commodities that are to be found at his Shop  I shall content my self with giving an Ac∣count of what I think most curious  Imprimis  his PocketBooks are very neat and well con∣trived not for keeping  Bank  Bills or Gold∣smiths Notes I confess but they are admira∣ble for registring the Lodgings of  Madona  's and for preserving Letters from Ladies of Quality His Whips and Spurs are so nice that they'll make one that buys them ride a Foxhunting tho' before he hated Noise and early Rising and was afraid of breaking his Neck His Seals are curiously fancied and exquisitely well cut and of great Use to encourage young Gentlemen to write a good Hand  Ned Puzzle∣post  had been ill used by his WritingMaster and writ a Sort of a  Chinese  or downright  Scrawlian  However upon his buying a Seal of my Friend he is so much improved by con∣tinual Writing that it is believed in a short Time one may be able to read his Letters and  find out his Meaning without guessing His Pistols and Fusees are so very good that they are fit to be laid up among the finest  China  Then his TweezerCases are incomparable You shall have one not much bigger than your Finger with several Instruments in it all necessary every Hour of the Day during the whole Course of a Man's Life But if this Vertuoso excels in one Thing more than ano∣ther 'tis in Canes He has spent his most se∣lect Hours in the Knowledge of them and is arrived at that Perfection that he is able to hold forth upon Canes longer than upon any one Subject in the World Indeed his Canes are so finely clouded and so well made up either with Gold or AmberHeads that I am of the Opinion 'tis impossible for a Gentleman to walk talk sit or stand as he should do without one of them He knows the Value of a Cane by knowing the Value of the Buyer's Estate Sir  Timothy Shallow  has Two Thousand Pounds  per Annum  and  Tom Empty  One They both at several Times bought a Cane of  Charles  Sir  Timothy  's cost Ten Guinea's and  Tom Empty  's Five Upon comparing them they were perfectly alike Sir  Timothy  surprised there should be no Dif∣ference in the Canes and so much in the Price comes to  Charles  Damn it  Charles  says he you have sold me a Cane here for Ten Pieces and the very same to  Tom Empty  for Five Lord Sir  Timothy  says  Charles  I am concerned that you whom I took to under∣stand Canes better than any Baronet in Town should be so overseen Why Sir  Timothy  yours is a true  Jambee  and Squire  Empty  's only a plain Dragon  This Vertuoso has a Parcel of  Jambees  now growing in the  EastIndies  where he keeps a Man on purpose to look after them which will  be the finest that ever landed in  Great Britain  and will be sit to cut about Two Years hence Any Gentleman may subscribe for as many as he pleases Subscriptions will be taken in at his Shop at Ten Guinea's each Joint They that subscribe for Six shall have a Dragon  Gratis  This is all I have to say at present concerning  Charles  's Curiosities and hope it may be suf∣ficient to prevail with you to take him into your Consideration which if you comply with you will oblige  Your humble Servant  N B  Whereas there came out last Term several Gold SnuffBoxes and others This is to give No∣tice That  Charles  wil put out a new Edition on  Saturday  next which will be the only one in Fashion till after  Easter  The Gentleman that gave Fifty Pounds for the Box set with Diamonds may shew it till  Sunday  Night provided he goes to Church but not after that Time there being one to be published on  Monday  which will cost Fourscore Guinea's  The TATLER N  o    From  Tuesday March  to  Thursday March    SheerLane  March  I Was this Afternoon surprised with a Visit from my Sister  Jenny  after an Absence of some Time She had methought in her Manner and Air something that was a little below that of the Women of first Breeding and Quality but at the same Time above the Simplicity and Familiarity of her usual Deportment As soon as she was seated she began to talk to me of the odd Place  I lived in and begged of me to remove out of the Lane where I have been so long acquainted for said she it does so spoil one's Horses that I must beg your Pardon if you see me much seldom∣er when I am to make so great a Journey with a single Pair and make Visits and get Home the same Night I understood her pretty well but would not therefore desired her to pay off her Coach for I had a great deal to talk to her She very pertly told me She came in her own Chariot Why said I is your Husband in Town And has he set up an Equipage No answered she but I have received  l  by his Order and his Letters which came at the same Time bad me want for nothing that was necessary I was heartily concerned at her Folly whose Affairs render her but just able to bear such an Expence However I considered that according to the  Bri∣tish  Custom of treating Women there is no other Method to be used in removing any of their Faults and Errors but conducting their Minds from one Humour to another with as much Ce∣remony as we lead their Persons from one Place to another I therefore dissembled my Concern and in Compliance with her as a Lady that was to use her Feet no more I begged of her after a short Visit to let me persuade her not to stay out till it was late for fear of catching Cold as she went into her Coach in the Dampness of the Evening The  Malapert  knew well enough I laughed at her but was not ill pleased with the Certainty of her Power over her Husband who she knew would support her in any Humour he was able rather than pass through the Torment of an Expostulation to gainsay any Thing she had a Mind to As soon as my fine Lady was gone I writ the following Letter to my Bro∣ther  Dear Brother  I Am at present under very much Concern at the splendid Appearance I saw my Sister make in an Equipage which she has set up in your Absence I beg of you not to indulge her in this Vanity and desire you to consi∣der the World is so whimsical that though it will value you for being happy it will hate you for appearing so The Possession of Wisdom and Virtue the only solid Distinctions of Life is allowed much more easily than that of Wealth and Quality Besides which I must intreat you to weigh with your self What it is that People aim at in setting themselves out to Show in gay Equipages and moderate Fortunes You are not by this Means a better Man than your Neighbour is but your Horses are better than his are And will you suffer Care and Inquietude to have it said as you pass by Those are very pretty punch Nags Nay when you have arrived at this there are a Hundred worth∣less Fellows who are still Four Horses happier than you are Remember dear Brother there is a certain Modesty in the Enjoyment of mo∣derate Wealth which to transgress exposes Men to the utmost Derision and as there is nothing but Meanness of Spirit can move a Man to value himself upon what can be purchased with Mo∣ney so he that shows an Ambition that Way and cannot arrive at it is more emphatically guilty of that Meanness I give you only my first Thoughts on this Occasion but shall as I am a Censor entertain you in my next with my Sentiments in general upon the Subject of Equi∣page and show that tho' there are no sump∣tuary Laws amongst us Reason and good Sense are equally binding and will ever prevail in ap∣pointing Approbation or Dislike in all Matters  of an indifferent Nature when they are pursued with Earnestness I am  SIR  c  ADVERTISEMENTS  To all Gentlemen Ladies and others that delight in soft Lines  These are to give Notice That the proper Time of the Tear for writing Pastorals now drawing near there is a StageCoach settled from the  OneBell  in the  Strand  to  Dorchester  which sets out twice a Week and passes through  Basingstoke Sutton Stockbridge Salisbury Blandford  and so to  Dor∣chester  over the finest Downs in  England  At all which Places there are Accommodations of Spread∣ing Beeches Beds of Flowers Turf Seats and Pur∣ling Streams for happy Swains and Thunder∣struck Oaks and Lefthanded Ravens to foretel Misfortunes to those that please to be wretched with all other Necessaries for pensive Passion  And for the Conveniency of such whose Affairs will not permit 'em to leave this Town at the same Place they may be furnished during the Season with Open∣ing Buds Flowring Thyme Warbling Birds Sport∣ing Lambkins and Fountain Water right and good and bottled on the Spot by one sent down on Purpose  N B  The Nymphs and Swains are farther given to understand That in those happy Climes they are so far from being troubled with Wolves that for want of even Foxes a considerable Pack of Hounds have been lately forced to eat Sheep  Whereas on the th Instant at Midnight several Persons of light Honour and loose Mirth having ta∣ken upon them in the Shape of Men but with the Voice of the Players belonging to Mr  Powell's  Com∣pany to call up Surgeons at Midnight and send Phy∣sicians to Persons in sound Sleep and perfect Health  This is to certify That Mr  Powell  had locked up the Legs of all his Company for Fear of Mischief that Night and that Mr  Powell  will not pay for any Damages done by the said Persons It is also farther advised That there were no Midwives wanted when those Persons called them up in the several Parts of  Westminster  but that those Gentlewomen who were in the Company of the said Imposters may take Care to call such useful Persons on the th of  December  next  The Censor having observed That there are fine wrought Ladies Shoes and Slippers put out to View at a great Shoemaker's Shop towards St  James  's End of  PallMall  which create irregular Thoughts and Desires in the Youth of this Nation The said Shopkeeper is required to take in those Eyesores or show Cause the next CourtDay why he continues to expose the same and he is required to be prepared particularly to answer to the Slippers with green Lace and blue Heels  It is impossible for me to return the obliging Things Mr  Joshua Barnes  has said to me upon the Account of our mutual Friend  Homer  He and I have read him now Forty Years with some Un∣derstanding and great Admiration A Work to be produced by one who has enjoyed so great an Intimacy with an Author is certainly to be va∣lued more than any Comment made by Persons of Yesterday Therefore according to my Friend  Joshua  's Request I recommend his  Mr  Joshua Barnes  's new and accurate Edition of all  Homer  's Works  c  Work and having used a little Magick in the Case I give this Recommendation by Way of  Amulet or Charm against the Malignity of envious Backbiters who speak Evil of Performances whereof themselves were never capable  If I may use my Friend  Joshua  's  own Words I shall at present say no more but that we  Homer  's oldest Acquaintance now living know best his Ways and can inform the World that they are often mistaken when they think he is in Lethargick Fits which we know he was never subject to and shall make appear to be rank Scandal and Envy that of the  Latin  Poet  Aliquando bonus dormitat Homerus  The TATLER N  o    From  Thursd March  to  Saturd March    SheerLane  March  IN a Nation of Liberty there is hardly a Per∣son in the whole Mass of the People more ab∣solutely necessary than a Censor It is allowed that I have no Authority for assuming this impor∣tant Appellation and that I am Censor of these Nations just as one is chosen King at the Game of Questions and Commands But if in the Exe∣cution of this fantastical Dignity I observe upon Things which do not fall within the Cognizance of real Authority I hope it will be granted that an idle Man could not be more usefully employed Among all the Irregularities of which I have ta∣ken Notice I know none so proper to be present∣ed to the World by a Censor as that of the gene∣ral Expence and Affectation in Equipage I have lately hinted that this Extravagance must neces∣sarily get Footing where we have no sumptuary Laws and where every Man may be dressed at∣tended and carried in what Manner he pleases But my Tenderness to my Fellow Subjects will not permit me to let this Enormity go unob∣served  As the Matter now stands every Man takes it in his Head that he has a Liberty to spend his Money as he pleases Thus in Spight of all Order Justice and Decorum we the greater Number of the Queen's loyal Subjects for no Reason in the World but because we want Money do not share alike in the Division of Her Majesty's HighRoad The Horses and Slaves of the Rich take up the whole Street while we Peripateticks are very glad to watch an Opportunity to whisk cross a Pas∣sage very thankful that we are not run over for interrupting the Machine that carries in it a Per∣son neither more handsome wise or valiant than the Meanest of us For this Reason were I to propose a Tax it should certainly be upon Coaches and Chairs For no Man living can as∣sign a Reason why one Man should have half a Street to carry him at his Ease and perhaps only in Pursuit of Pleasures when as good a Man as himself wants Room for his own Person to pass upon the most necessary and urgent Occasion Till such an Acknowledgment is made to the Pub∣lick I shall take upon me to vest certain Rights in the Scavengers of the Cities of  London  and  West∣minster  to take the Horses and Servants of all such as do not become or deserve such Distinctions into their peculiar Custody The Offenders them∣selves I shall allow safe Conduct to their Places of Abode in the Carts of the said Scavengers but their Horses shall be mounted by their Footmen and sent into the Service Abroad And I take this Opportunity in the first Place to recruit the Regiment of my good old Friend the brave and honest  Sylvius  that they be as well taught as they are fed It is to me most miraculous so unrea∣sonable an Usurpation as this I am speaking of should so long have been tolerated We hang a poor Fellow for taking any trifle from us on the Road and bear with the Rich for robbing us of the Road it self Such a Tax as this would be of  great Satisfaction to us who walk on Foot and since the Distinction of riding in a Coach is not to be appointed according to a Man's Merit or Ser∣vice to their Country nor that Liberty given as a Reward for some eminent Virtue we should be highly contented to see them pay something for the Insult they do us in the State they take upon them while they are drawn by us  'Till they have made us some Reparation of this Kind we the Peripateticks of  Great Britain  can∣not think our selves well treated while every one that is able is allowed to set up an Equipage  As for my Part I cannot but admire how Per∣sons conscious to themselves of no Manner of Superiority above others can out of meer Pride or Laziness expose themselves at this Rate to pub∣lick View and put us all upon pronouncing those Three terrible Syllables Who is that When it comes to that Question our Method is to consi∣der the Mien and Air of the Passenger and com∣fort our selves for being dirty to the Ankles by laughing at his Figure and Appearance who over∣looks us I must confess were it not for the so∣lid Injustice of the Thing there is nothing could afford a discerning Eye greater Occasion for Mirth than this licentious Huddle of Qualities and Characters in the Equipages about this Town The Overseers of the Highway and Constables have so little Skill or Power to rectify this Mat¦ter that you may often see the Equipage of a Fel∣low whom all the Town knows to deserve hang∣ing make a Stop that shall interrupt the Lord High Chancellor and all the Judges in their Way to  Westminster  For the better understanding of Things and Per∣sons in this general Confusion I have given Di∣rections to all the CoachMakers and CoachPainters in Town to bring me in Lists of their several Customers and doubt not but with com∣paring the Orders of each Man in the placing his  Arms on the Doors of his Chariot as well as the Words Devices and Cyphers to be fix'd upon them to make a Collection which shall let us into the Nature if not the History of Mankind more usefully than the Curiosities of any Medal∣list in  Europe  But this Evil of Vanity in our Figure with many others proceeds from a certain Gaie∣ty of Heart which has crept into Men's very Thoughts and Complexions The Passions and Adventures of Hero's when they enter the Lists for the Tournament in Romances are not more easily distinguishable by their Palfreys and their Armour than the secret Springs and Affections of the several Pretenders to Show amongst us are known by their Equipages in ordinary Life The young Bridegroom with his gilded Cupids and winged Angels has some Excuse in the Joy of his Heart to launch out into something that may be significant of his present Happiness But to see Men for no Reason upon Earth but that they are rich ascend Triumphant Chariots and ride thro' the People has at the Bottom nothing else in it but an insolent Transport arising only from the Distinction of Fortune  It is therefore high Time that I call in such Coaches as are in their Embellishments improper for the Character of their Owners But if I find I am not obeyed herein and that I cannot pull down these Equipages already erected I shall take upon me to prevent the Growth of this Evil for the future by enquiring into the Pretensions of the Persons who shall hereafter attempt to make publick Entries with Ornaments and Decorations of their own Appointment If a Man who be∣lieved he had the handsomest Leg in this King∣dom should take a Fancy to adorn so deserving a Limb with a blue Garter he would justly be punished for offending against the Most Noble Order And I think the general Prostitution  of Equipage and Retinue is as destructive to all Distinction as the Impertinence of one Man if

into Consideration a late Request of two indul∣gent Parents touching the Care of a young Daughter whom they design to send to a Board∣ingSchool or keep at Home according to my Determination but I am diverted from that Sub∣ject by Letters which I have received from seve∣ral Ladies complaining of a certain Sect of pro∣fessed Enemies to the Repose of the Fair Sex cal∣led Oglers These are it seems Gentlemen who look with deep Attention on one Object at the  Playhouses and are ever staring all round them in Churches It is urged by my Correspondents that they do all that is possible to keep their Eyes off these Insnarers but that by what Power they know not both their Diversions and Devo∣tions are interrupted by them in such a Manner as that they cannot attend either without stealing Looks at the Persons whose Eyes are fixed upon them By this Means my Petitioners say they find themselves grow insensibly less offended and in Time enamoured of these their Enemies What is required of me on this Occasion is That as I love and study to preserve the better Part of Man∣kind the Females I would give them some Ac∣count of this dangerous Way of Assault against which there is so little Defence that it lays Am∣bush for the Sight it self and makes them see∣ingly knowingly willingly and forcibly go on to their own Captivity  This Representation of the present State of Af∣fairs between the Two Sexes gave me very much Alarm and I had no more to do but to recollect what I had seen at any one Assembly for some Years last past to be convinced of the Truth and Justice of this Remonstrance If there be not a Stop put to this evil Art all the Modes of Address and the elegant Embellishments of Life which arise out of the noble Passion of Love will of Ne∣cessity decay Who would be at the Trouble of Rhetorick or study the  Bon Mien  when his Intro∣duction is so much easier obtained by a sudden Reverence in a downcast Look at the meeting the Eye of a Fair Lady and beginning again to ogle her as soon as she glances another Way I remem∣ber very well when I was last at an Opera I could perceive the Eyes of the whole Audience last into particular cross Angles one upon ano∣ther without any Manner of Regard to the Stage though King  Latinus  was himself present when I made that Observation It was then very plea∣sant  to look into the Hearts of the whole Com∣pany for the Balls of Sight are so form'd that one Man's Eyes are Spectacles to another to read his Heart with The most ordinary Beholder can take Notice of any violent Agitation in the Mind any pleasing Transport or any inward Grief in the Person he looks at but one of these Oglers can see a studied Indifference a concealed Love or a smother'd Resentment in the very Glances that are made to hide those Dispositions of Thought The Naturalists tell us That the Rattle Snake will fix himself under a Tree where he sees a Squirrel playing and when he has once got the Exchange of a Glance from the pretty Wan∣ton will give it such a sudden Stroke on its Ima∣gination that though it may play from Bough to Bough and strive to avert its Eyes from it for some Time yet it comes nearer and nearer by little In∣tervals of looking another Way 'till it drops into the Jaws of the Animal which it knew gazed at it for no other Reason but to ruin it I did not believe this Piece of Philosophy 'till that Night I was just now speaking of but I then saw the same Thing pass between an Ogler and a Coquer  Mirtillo  the most learned of the former had for some Time discontinued to visit  Flavia  no less eminent among the latter They industriously avoided all Places where they might probably meet but Chance brought them together to the Playhouse and seated them in a direct Line over∣against each other she in a Front Box he in the Pit next the Stage As soon as  Flavia  had recei∣ved the Looks of the whole Crowd below her with that Air of Insensibility which is necessary at the first Entrance she began to look round her and saw the Vagabond  Mirtillo  who had so long absented himself from her Circle and when she first discover'd him she looked upon him with that Glance which in the Language of Oglers is call'd the  Scornful  but immediately turn'd her  Observation another Way and returned upon him with the  Indifferent  This gave  Mirtillo  no small Resentment but he used her accordingly He took Care to be ready for her next Glance She found his Eyes full in the Indolent with his Lips crumpled up in the Posture of one Whistling Her Anger at this Usage immediately appeared in every Muscle of her Face and after many Emo∣tions which glisten'd in her Eyes she cast them round the whole House and gave 'em Softnesses in the Face of every Man she had ever seen before After she thought she had reduced all she saw to her Obedience the Play began and ended their Dialogue As soon as the first Act was over she stood up with a Visage full of dissembled Alacrity and Pleasure with which she overlooked the Au∣dience and at last came to him He was then placed in a Sideway with his Hat slouching over his Eyes and gazing at a Wench in the SideBox as talking of that Gipsy to the Gentle∣man who sate by him But as she was fixed upon him he turned suddenly with a full Face upon her and with all the Respect imaginable made her the most obsequious Bow in the Presence of the whole Theatre This gave her a Pleasure not to be concealed and she made him the Recovering or Second Courtesy with a Smile that spoke a per∣fect Reconciliation Between the ensuing Acts they talked to each other with Gestures and Glan∣ces so significant that they ridiculed the whole House in this silent Speech and made an Appoint∣ment that  Mirtillo  should lead her to her Coach  The peculiar Language of one Eye as it differs from another as much as the Tone of one Voice from another and the Fascination or Enchant∣ment which is lodged in the Optick Nerves of the Persons concerned in these Dialogues is I must confess too nice a Subject for one who is not an Adept in these Speculations but I shall for the Good and Safety of the Fair Sex call my  learned Friend Sir  William Read  to my Assistance and by the Help of his Observations on this Or∣gan acquaint them when the Eye is to be belie∣ved and when distrusted On the contrary I shall conceal the true Meaning of the Looks of Ladies and indulge in them all the Art they can acquire in the Management of their Glances All which is but too little against Creatures who tri∣umph in Falshood and begin to forswear with their Eyes when their Tongues can

to me in a very moving Manner of the Loss of a  Wife and another in Terms still more moving' of a Purse of Money that was taken from him on  Bagshot  Heath and which he tells me would not have

not to be measured from the Nature of the Evil but from the Temper of the Sufferer I shall present my Readers who are unhappy either in Reality or Imagination with an Allegory for which I am indebted to the great Father and Prince of Poets  As I was sitting after Dinner in my ElbowChair I took up  Homer  and dipped into that famous Speech of  Achilles  to  Priam  in which he tells him That  Jupiter  has by him Two great Vessels the one filled with Blessings and the other with Misfortunes out of which he mingles a Composition for every Man that comes into the World This Passage so exceedingly pleased me that as I fell insensibly into my Afternoon's Slum∣ber it wrought my Imagination into the follow∣ing Dream  When  Jupiter  took into his Hands the Govern∣ment of the World the several Parts of Nature with the Presiding Deities did Homage to him One presented him with a Mountain of Winds another with a Magazine of Hail and a third with a Pile of Thunderbolts The Stars offer'd up their Influences the Ocean gave in his Tri∣dent the Earth her Fruits and the Sun his Sea∣sons Among the several Deities who came to make their Court on this Occasion the Destinies advanced with two great Tuns carried before them one of which they fixed at the Right Hand of  Jupiter  as he sate upon his Throne and the other on his Left The first was filled with all the Blessings and the other with all the Calami∣ties of Humane Life  Jupiter  in the Beginning of his Reign finding the World much more in∣nocent than it is in this Iron Age poured very plentifully out of the Tun that stood at his Right Hand but as Mankind degenerated and became unworthy of his Blessings he set abroach the other Vessel that filled the World with Pain and Poverty Battles and Distempers Jealousy and Falshood intoxicating Pleasures and untimely Deaths  He was at length so very much incensed at the great Depravation of Humane Nature and the repeated Provocations which he received from all Parts of the Earth that having resolved to de∣stroy  the whole Species except  Deucalion  and  Pyrrha  he commanded the Destinies to gather up the Blessings which he had thrown away upon the Sons of Men and lay them up till the World should be inhabited by a more virtuous and deser∣ving Race of Mortals  The Three Sisters immediately repaired to the Earth in Search of the several Blessings that had been scatter'd on it but found the Task which was enjoined them to be much more difficult than they had imagin'd The first Places they resorted to as the most likely to succeed in were Cities Palaces and Courts but instead of meet∣ing with what they looked for here they found nothing but Envy Repining Uneasiness and the like bitter Ingredients of the LeftHand Vessel Whereas to their great Surprize they discovered Content Chearfulness Health Innocence and other the most substantial Blessings of Life in Cottages Shades and Solitudes  There was another Circumstance no less unex∣pected than the former and which gave them very great Perplexity in the Discharge of the Trust which  Jupiter  had committed to them They observed that several Blessings had dege∣nerated into Calamities and that several Calami∣ties had improved into Blessings according as they fell into the Possession of wise or foolish Men They often found Power with so much Insolence and Impatience cleaving to it that it became a Misfortune to the Person on whom it was conferred Youth had often Distempers growing about it worse than the Infirmities of old Age Wealth was often united to such a sordid Avarice as made it the most uncomforta∣ble and painful Kind of Poverty On the contra∣ry they often found Pain made glorious by For∣titude Poverty lost in Content Deformity beau∣tified with Virtue In a Word the Blessings were often like good Fruits planted in a bad Soil that  by Degrees fall off from their natural Relish into Tasts altogether insipid or unwholsome and the Calamities like harsh Fruits cultivated in a good Soil and enriched by proper Grafts and Inocula∣tions till they swell with generous and delightful Juices  There was still a Third Circumstance that oc∣casioned as great a Surprize to the Three Sisters as either of the foregoing when they discovered several Blessings and Calamities which had never been in either of the Tuns that stood by the Throne of  Jupiter  and were nevertheless as great Occasions of Happiness or Misery as any there These were that spurious Crop of Blessings and Calamities which were never sown by the Hand of the Deity but grow of themselves out of the Fancies and Dispositions of Humane Creatures Such are Dress Titles Place Equipage false Shame and groundless Fear with the like vain Imaginations that shoot up in trifling weak and irresolute Minds  The Destinies finding themselves in so great a Perplexity concluded that it would be impossible for them to execute the Commands that had been given them according to their first Intention for which Reason they agreed to throw all the Bles∣sings and Calamities together into one large Ves∣sel and in that Manner offer them up at the Feet of  Jupiter  This was performed accordingly the eldest Si∣ster presenting her self before the Vessel and in∣troducing it with an Apology for what they had done  O  Jupiter  says she we have gathered to∣gether all the Good and Evil the Comforts and Distresses of Humane Life which we thus pre∣sent before thee in one promiscuous Heap We beseech thee that thou thy self wilt sort them out for the future as in thy Wisdom thou shalt  think fit For we acknowledge that there is none beside thee that can judge what will occa∣sion Grief or Joy in the Heart of a Humane Creature and what will prove a Blessing or a Calamity to the Person on whom it is be∣stowed  The TATLER N  o    Ut ameris amabilis esto  Ovid  From  Thursd March  to  Saturd March    From my own Apartment  March  REading is to the Mind what Exercise is to the Body As by the one Health is preser∣ved strenthened and invigorated by the other Virtue which is the Health of the Mind is kept alive cherished and confirmed But as Exercise becomes tedious and painful when we make use of it only as the Means of Health so Reading is apt to grow uneasy and burdensome when we apply our selves to it only for our Improvement in Vir∣tue For this Reason the Virtue which we ga∣ther from a Fable or an Allegory is like the Health we get by Hunting as we are engaged in an agreeable Pursuit that draws us on with Pleasure and makes us insensible of the Fatigues that ac∣company it  After this Preface I shall set down a very beautiful Allegorical Fable out of the great Poet whom I mentioned in my last Paper and whom it is very difficult to lay aside when one is enga∣ged in the reading of him And this I particularly design for the Use of several of my Fair Correspon∣dents who in their Letters have complained to  me that they have lost the Affections of their Husbands and desire my Advice how to recover them  Juno  says  Homer  seeing her  Jupiter  seated on the Top of Mount  Ida  and knowing that he had conceived an Aversion to her began to study how she should regain his Affections and make her self amiable to him With this Thought she immedi∣ately retired into her Chamber where she bathed her self in  Ambrosia  which gave her Person all its Beauty and diffused so divine an Odor as re∣fresh'd all Nature and sweeten'd both Heaven and Earth She let her immortal Tresses flow in the most graceful Manner and took a particular Care to dress her self in several Ornaments which the Poet describes at length and which the Goddess chose out as the most proper to set off her Person to the best Advantage In the next Place she made a Visit to  Venus  the Deity who presides over Love and begged of her as a par∣ticular Favour that she would lend her for a while those Charms with which she subdued the Hearts both of Gods and Men For says the Goddess I would make use of them to reconcile the Two Deities who took Care of me in my Infancy and who at present are at so great a Variance that they are estranged from each other's Bed  Venus  was proud of an Opportunity of obliging so great a Goddess and therefore made her a Present of the  Cestus  which she used to wear about her own Wast with Advice to hide it in her Bosom till she had accomplished her In∣tention This  Cestus  was a fine Partycoloured Girdie which as  Homer  tells us had all the At∣tractions of the Sex wrought into it The Four principal Figures in the Embroidery were Love Desi e Fondness of Speech and Conversation filled with that Sweetness and Complacency which says the Poet insensibly steal away the Hearts of the wisest Men  Juno  after having made these necessary Prepa∣rations came as by Accident into the Presence of  Jupiter  who is said to have been as much infla∣med with her Beauty as when he first stole to her Embraces without the Consent of their Parents  Juno  to cover her real Thoughts told him as she had told  Venus  That she was going to make a Visit to  Oceanus  and  Tethys  He prevailed upon her to stay with him protesting to her that she appeared more amiable in his Eye than ever any Mortal Goddess or even her self had appeared to him till that Day The Poet then represents him in so great an Ardour that without going up to the House which had been built by the Hands of  Vulcan  according to  Juno  's Direction he threw a Golden Cloud over their Heads as they sate upon the Top of Mount  Ida  while the Earth beneath them sprung up in Lotus's Saf∣frons Hyacinths and a Bed of the softest Flowers for their Repose  This close Translation of one of the finest Pas∣sages in  Homer  may suggest abundance of Instru∣ction to a Woman who has a Mind to preserve or recal the Affection of her Husband The Care of the Person and the Dress with the particular Blandishments woven in the  Cestus  are so plainly recommended by this Fable and so indispensibly necessary in every Female who desires to please that they need no further Explanation The Dis∣cretion likewise in covering all Matrimonial Quar∣rels from the Knowledge of others is taught in the pretended Visit to  Tethys  in the Speech where  Juno  addresses her self to  Venus  as the chast and prudent Management of a Wife's Charms is inti∣mated by the same Pretence for her appearing be∣fore  Jupiter  and by the Concealment of the  Cestus  in her Bosom  I shall leave this Tale to the Consideration of such good Housewives who are never well dres∣sed but when they are Abroad and think it ne∣cessary  to appear more agreeable to all Men living than their Husbands As also to those prudent Ladies who to avoid the Appearance of being overfond entertain their Husbands with Indiffe∣rence Aversion sullen Silence or exasperating Language  SheerLane  March  Upon my coming Home last Night I found a very handsome Present of Wine left for me as a Tast  of    Hogsheads which are to be put to Sale at  l  a Hogshead at  Garraway's  Coffeehouse in  Ex∣changeAlley  on the    d Instant at    in the After∣noon and to be tasted in Major  Long  's Vaults from the    th Instant till the Time of Sale  This having been sent to me with a Desire that I would give my Judgment upon it I immediately impannel∣led a Jury of Men of nice Palates and strong Heads who being all of them very scrupulous and unwilling to proceed rashly in a Matter of so great Importance refus'd to bring in their Ver∣dict till Three in the Morning at which Time the Foreman pronounc'd as well as he was able Extraaordinary  French  Claret For my own Part as I love to consult my Pillow in all Points of Moment I slept upon it before I would give my Sentence and this Morning confirmed the Verdict  Having mentioned this Tribute of Wine I must give Notice to my Correspondents for the future who shall apply to me on this Occasion That as I shall decide nothing unadvisedly in Matters of this Nature I cannot pretend to give Judgment of a right good Liquor without examining at least Three Dozen Bottles of it I must at the same Time do my self the Justice to let the World know that I have resisted great Temptations in this Kind as it is well known to a Butcher in  ClareMarket  who endeavoured to corrupt me with a Dozen and half of MarrowBones I had  likewise a Bribe sent me by a Fishmonger con∣sisting of a Collar of Brawn and a Joll of Sal∣mon but not finding them excellent in their Kinds I had the Integrity to eat them both up without speaking one Word of them However for the future I shall have an Eye to the Diet of this great City and will recommend the best and most wholesome Food to them if I receive these proper and respectful Notices from the Sel∣lers that it may not be said hereafter my Rea∣ders were better taught than fed  The TATLER N  o    Gustus Elementa per omnia quaerunt  Nunquam Animo Pretiis obstantibus  Juv  From  Saturd March  to  Tuesd March    From my own Apartment  March  HAVING intimated in my last Paper that I design to take under my Inspection the Diet of this great City I shall begin with a ve∣ry earnest and serious Exhortation to all my well∣disposed Readers that they would return to the Food of their Forefathers and reconcile them∣selves to Beef and Mutton This was the Diet which bred that hardy Race of Mortals who won the Fields of  Cressy  and  Agincourt  I need not go up so high as the History of  Guy  Earl of  Warwick  who is well known to have eaten up a Dun Cow of his own killing The Renown'd King  Arthur  is generally looked upon as the first who ever sat down to a whole roasted Ox which was certainly the best Way to preserve the Gravy and it is further added that he and his Knights sat about it at his Round Table and usually  consumed it to the very Bones before they would enter upon any Debate of Moment The Black Prince was a professed Lover of the Bris∣ket not to mention the History of the Surloin or the Institution of the Order of BeefEaters which are all so many evident and undeniable Marks of the great Respect which our Warlike Predecessors have paid to this excellent Food The Tables of the ancient Gentry of this Nation were cover'd thrice a Day with hot RoastBeef and I am credibly informed by an Antiquary who has searched the Registers in which the Bills of Fare of the Court are recorded that in∣stead of Tea and Bread and Butter which have prevailed of late Years the Maids of Honour in Queen  Elizabeth  's Time were allowed Three Rumps of Beef for their Breakfast Mutton has likewise been in great Repute among our valiant Countrymen but was formerly observed to be the Food rather of Men of nice and delicate Ap∣petites than those of strong and robust Constitu∣tions For which Reason even to this Day we use the Word SheepBiter as a Term of Reproach as we do BeefEater in a respectful and honoura∣ble Sense As for the Flesh of Lamb Veal Chicken and other Animals under Age they were the Invention of sickly and degenerate Pa∣lates according to that wholesome Remark of  Daniel  the Historian who takes Notice That in all Taxes upon Provisions during the Reigns of several of our Kings there is nothing mentioned besides the Flesh of such Fowl and Cattle as were arrived at their full Growth and were ma∣ture for Slaughter The Common People of this Kingdom do still keep up the Taste of their Ancestors and it is to this that we in a great Measure owe the unparallelled Victories that have been gained in this Reign For I would desire my Reader to consider what Work our Country∣men would have made at  Blenheim  and  Ramil∣lies  if they had been fed with Fricacies and Ra∣gousts  For this Reason we at present see the florid Complexion the strong Limb and the hale Constitution are to be found chiefly among the meaner Sort of People or in the wild Gentry who have been educated among the Woods or Mountains Whereas many great Families are insensibly fallen off from the Athletick Consti∣tution of their Progenitors and are dwindled away into a pale sickly spindlelegged Gene∣ration of Valetudinarians  I may perhaps be thought extravagant in my Notion but I must confess I am apt to impute the Dishonours that sometimes happen in great families to the inflaming kind of Diet which is so much in Fashion Many Dishes can excite Desire without giving Strength and heat the Body without nourishing it as Physicians ob∣serve That the poorest and most dispirited Blood is most subject to Fevers I look upon a  French  Ragoust to be as pernicious to the Stomach as a Glass of Spirits and when I have seen a young Lady swallow all the Instigations of high Soups seasoned Sauces and forced Meats I have won∣dered at the Despair or tedious Sighing of her Lovers  The Rules among these false Delicates are to be as Contradictory as they can be to Nature  Without expecting the Return of Hunger they eat for an Appetite and prepare Dishes not to al∣lay but to excite it  They admit of nothing at their Tables in its natural Form or without some Disguise  They are to eat every Thing before it comes in Season and to leave it off as soon as it is good to be eaten  They are not to approve any Thing that is agreeable to ordinary Palates and nothing is to  gratify their Senses but what would offend those of their Inferiors  I remember I was last Summer invited to a Friend's House who is a great Admirer of the  French  Cookery and as the Phrase is  eats well  At our fitting down I found the Table covered with a great Variety of Unknown Dishes I was mightily at a Loss to learn what they were and therefore did not know where to help my self That which stood before me I took to be a roasted Porcupine however did not care for ask∣ing Questions and have since been informed that it was only a larded Turkey I afterwards passed my Eye over several Hashes which I do not know the Names of to this Day and hearing that they were Delicacies did not think fit to meddle with them  Among other Dainties I saw something like a Pheasant and therefore desired to be helped to a Wing of it but to my great Surprize my Friend told me it was a Rabbet which is a sort of Meat I never cared for At last I discovered with some Joy a Pig at the lower End of the Table and begged a Gentleman that was near it to cut me a Piece of it Upon which the Gentleman of the House said with great Civility I am sure you will like the Pig for it was whipped to Death I must confess I heard him with Horror and could not eat of an Animal that had died so tra∣gical a Death I was now in great Hunger and Confusion when methought I smelled the a∣greeable Savour of Roast Beef but could not tell from which Dish it arose though I did not que∣stion but it lay disguised in one of them Upon turning my Head I saw a noble Sirloin on the SideTable smoaking in the most delicious Man∣ner I had Recourse to it more than once and could not see without some Indignation that substantial  English  Dish banished in so igno∣minious  a Manner to make Way for  French  kshaws  The Desert was brought up at last which in  th was as extraordinary as any Thing that  come before it The whole when ranged  ts proper Order looked like a very beautiful  terPiece There were several Pyramids of  ndy'd Sweetmeats that hung like Icicles  th Fruits scattered up and down and hid in an  ificial kind of Frost At the same Time there  ere great Quantities of Cream beaten up into  Snow and near them little Plates of Sugar∣  umbs disposed like so many Heaps of Hail∣  nes with a Multitude of Congelations in Jel∣  s of various Colours I was indeed so pleased  th the several Objects which lay before me  at I did not care for displacing any of them  d was half angry with the rest of the Com∣  ny that for the Sake of a Piece of Lemon∣  el or a SugarPlumb would spoil so pleasing  Picture Indeed I could not but smile to see  veral of them cooling their Mouths with Lumps  f Ice which they had just before been burning with Salts and Peppers  As soon as this Show was over I took my  eave that I might finish my Dinner at my own House For as I in every Thing love what is  mple and natural so particularly in my Food Two plain Dishes with Two or Three goodna∣  ured chearful ingenious Friends would make  he more pleased and vain than all that Pomp  nd Luxury can bestow For it is my Maxim That he keeps the greatest Table who has the most valuable Company at it  The TATLER N  o    From  Tuesd March  to  Thursd March    From my own Apartment  March  IT has often been a solid Grief to me when I have reflected on this glorious Nation which is the Scene of publick Happiness and Liberty that there are still Crowds of private Tyrants against whom there neither is any Law now in Being nor can there be invented any by the Wit of Man These cruel Men are illnatured Husbands The Commerce in the Conjugal State is so delicate that it is impossible to prescribe Rules for the Conduct of it so as to fit Ten Thousand name∣less Pleasures and Disquietudes which arise to People in that Condition But it is in this as in some other nice Cases where touching upon the Malady tenderly is half Way to the Cure and there are some Faults which need only to be observed to be amended I am put into this Way of thinking by a late Conversation which I am going to give an Account of  I made a Visit the other Day to a Family for which I have a great Honour and found the Fa∣ther the Mother and Two or Three of the younger Children drop off designedly to leave me alone with the eldest Daughter who was but a Visitant there as well as my self and is the Wife of a Gentleman of a very fair Character in the World As soon as we were alone I saw her Eyes fall of Tears and methought she had much to say to me for which she wanted En∣couragement Madam said I you know I wish you all as well as any Friend you have Speak freely what I see you are oppressed with and  you may be sure if I cannot relieve your Di∣stress you may at least reap so much present Ad∣vantage as safely to give your self the Ease of uttering it She immediately assumed the most becoming Composure of Countenance and spoke as follows  'It is an Aggravation of Affliction in a married Life that there is a Sort of Guilt in communicating it For which Rea∣son it is that a Lady of your and my Ac∣quaintance instead of speaking to you her self desired me the next Time I saw you as you are a professed Friend to our Sex to turn your Thoughts upon the reciprocal Complaisance which is the Duty of a married State'  'My Friend was neither in Fortune Birth or Education below the Gentleman whom she has married Her Person her Age and her Character are also such as he can make no Ex∣ception to But so it is that from the Moment the MarriageCeremony was over the Obse∣quiousness of a Lover was turned into the Haughtiness of a Master All the kind En∣deavours which she uses to please him are at best but so many Instances of her Duty This Insolence takes away that secret Satisfaction which does not only excite to Virtue but also rewards it It abates the Fire of a free and generous Love and imbitters all the Pleasures of a social Life The young Lady spoke all this with such an Air of Resentment as discovered how nearly she was concerned in the Distress'  When I observed she had done speaking Ma∣dam said I the Affliction you mention is the greatest that can happen in Humane Life and I know but one Consolation in it if that be a Con∣solation that the Calamity is a pretty general one There is nothing so common as for Men to enter into Marriage without so much as expect∣ing to be happy in it They seem to propose to  themselves a few Holidays in the Beginning of it after which they are to return at best to the usual Course of their Life and for ought they know to constant Misery and Uneasiness From this false Sense of the State they are going into proceeds the immediate Coldness and Indiffe∣rence or Hatred and Aversion which attend ordinary Marriages or rather Bargains to coha∣bit Our Conversation was here interrupted by Company which came in upon us  The Humour of affecting a superior Carriage generally rises from a false Notion of the Weak∣ness of a Female Understanding in general or an overweaning Opinion that we have of our own For when it proceeds from a natural Rug∣gedness and Brutality of Temper it is altoge∣ther incorrigible and not to be amended by Ad∣monition Sir  Francis Bacon  as I remember lays it down as a Maxim That no Marriage can be happy in which the Wife has no Opinion of her Husband's Wisdom but without Offence to so great an Authority I may venture to say That a sullenwife Man is as bad as a goodna∣tured Fool Knowledge softened with Compla∣cency and good Breeding will make a Man equal∣ly beloved and respected but when joined with a severe distant and unsociable Temper it creates rather Fear than Love I who am a Batchelor have no other Notion of Conjugal Tenderness out what I learn from Books and shall there∣fore produce Three Letters of  Pliny  who was not only one of the greatest but the most  arned Men in the whole  Roman  Empire At the same Time I am very much ashamed that on such Occasions I am obliged to have Re∣cou  se to Heathen Authors and shall appeal to my Readers if they would not think it a Mark of a narrow Education in a Man of Qua∣lity to write such passionate Letters to any Wo∣man but a Mistress They were all Three writ∣ten  at a Time when she was at a Distance from him The first of them puts me in Mind of a married Friend of Mine who said Sickness it self

following you thither For I more particularly wish to be with you at present that I might be sensible of the Pro∣gress you make in the Recovery of your Strength and Health as also of the Enter∣tainment and Diversions you can meet with in your Retirement Believe me it is an anxious State of Mind to live in Ignorance of what happens to those whom we passionately love I am not only in Pain for your Absence but al∣so for your Indisposition I am afraid of every Thing fancy every Thing and as it is the Na∣ture of Men in Fear I fancy those Things most which I am most afraid of Let me there∣fore earnestly desire you to favour me under these my Apprehensions with One Letter every Day or if possible with Two for I shall be a little at Ease while I am reading your Letters and grow anxious again as soon as I have read them  Second LETTER  YOU tell me That you are very much af∣flicted at my Absence and that you have no Satisfaction in any Thing but my Writings which you often lay by you upon my Pillow You oblige me very much in wishing to see me and making me your Comforter in my Absence In Return I must let you know I am no less pleased with the Letters which you writ to me and read them over a Thousand  Times with new Pleasure If your Letters are capable of giving me so much Pleasure what would your Conversation do Let me beg of you to write to me often though at the same Time I must confess your Letters give me Anguish whilst they give me Pleasure  Third LETTER  IT is impossible to conceive how much I lan∣guish for you in your Absence the tender Love I bear you is the chief Cause of this my Uneasiness which is still the more insupporta∣ble because Absence is wholly a new Thing to us I lie awake most Part of the Night in thinking of you and several Times of the Day go as naturally to your Apartment as if you were there to receive me but when I miss you I come away dejected out of Humour and like a Man that had suffered a Repulse There is but one Part of the Day in which I am relieved from this Anxiety and that is when I am engaged in Publick Affairs  You may guess at the uneasy Condition of one who has no Rest but in Business no Conso∣lation but in Trouble  I shall conclude this Paper with a beautiful Passage out of  Milton  and leave it as a Lecture to those of my own Sex who have a Mind to make their Conversation agreeable as well as instru∣ctive to the Fair Partners who are fallen into their Care  Eve  having observed That  Adam  was entring into some deep Disquisitions with the Angel who was sent to visit him is de∣scribed as

 o    Haec sunt Jucundi Causa Cibus{que} Mali  Ovid  From  Thursd March  to  Saturd March    From my own Apartment  March  I Have received the following Letter upon the Subject of my last Paper The Writer of it tells me I there spoke of Marriage as one that knows it only by Speculation and for that Rea∣son he sends me his Sense of it as drawn from Experience  Mr  Bickerstaff  I Have read your Paper of this Day and think you have done the Nuptial State a great deal of Justice in the Authority you give us of  Pliny  whose Letters to his Wife you have there tran∣slated But give me Leave to tell you That it is impossible for you that are a Batchelor to have so just a Notion of this Way of Life as  to touch the Affections of your Readers in a Particular wherein every Man's own Heart suggests more than the nicest Observer can form to himself without Experience I therefore who am an old married Man have sat down to give you an Account of the Matter from my own Knowledge and the Observations which I have made upon the Conduct of others in that most agreeable or wretched Condition  It is very commonly observed That the most smart Pangs whech we meet with are in the Beginning of Wedlock which proceed from Ignorance of each others Humour and Want of Prudence to make Allowances for a Change from the most careful Respect to the most un∣bounded Familiarity Hence it arises That Trifles are commonly Occasions of the greatest Anxiety for Contradiction being a Thing wholly unusual between a new married Couple the smallest Instance of it is taken for the highest Injury and it very seldom happens that the Man is slow enough in assuming the Character of an Husband or the Woman quick enough in condescending to that of a Wife It imme∣diately follows That they think they have all the Time of their Courtship been talking in Masks to each other and therefore begin to act like disappointed People  Philander  finds  Delia  illnatur'd and impertinent and  Delia Philander  surly and inconstant  I have known a fond Couple quarrel in the very Honeymoon about cutting up a Tart Nay I could name Two who after having had Seven Children fell out and parted Beds upon the boiling of a Leg of Mutton My very next Neighbours have not spoke to one another these Three Days because they differ'd in their Opi∣nions whether the Clock should stand by the Window or over the Chimney It may seem strange to you who are not a married Man  when I tell you how the least Trifle can strike a Woman dumb for a Week together But if you ever enter into this State you will find that the Soft Sex as often express their Anger by an obstinate Silence as by an ungovernable Cla∣mour  Those indeed who begin this Course of Life without Jars at their setting out arrive with∣in few Months at a Pitch of Benevolence and Affection of which the most perfect Friend∣ship is but a feint Resemblance As in the un∣fortunate Marriage the most minute and in∣different Things are Objects of the sharpest Re∣sentment so in an happy One they are Occa∣sions of the most exquisite Satisfaction For what does not oblige in one we love What does not offend in one we dislike For these Reasons I take it for a Rule That in Marriage the chief Business is to acquire a Prepossession in Favour of each other They should consi¦der one another's Words and Actions with a secret Indulgence There should be always an inward Fondness pleading for each other such as may add new Beauties to every Thing that is excellent give Charms to what is indiffe∣rent and cover every Thing that is defective For want of this kind Propensity and Biass of Mind the married Pair often take Thi  as ill of each other which no one else would take Notice of in either of them  But the most unhappy Circumstance of all is where each Party is always laying up Fuel for Dissention and gathering together a Maga∣zine of Provocations to exasperate each other with when they are out of Humour These People in common Discourse make no Scruple to let those who are by know they are quarrelling with one another and think they are discreet enough if they conceal from the Company the Matters which they are hinting at About  a Week ago I was entertained for a whole Dinner with a mysterious Conversation of this Nature out of which I could learn no more than that the Husband and Wife were angry at one another We had no sooner sate down but says the Gentleman of the House in order to raise Discourse I thought  Margarita  sung extremely well last Night Upon this says the Lady looking as pale as Ashes I suppose she had Cherrycoloured Ribands on No an∣swered the Husband with a Flush in his Face but she had Laced Shoes I look upon it that a Standerby on such Occasions has as much Reason to be out of Countenance as ei∣ther of the Combatants To turn off my Con∣fusion and seem regardless of what had passed I desired the Servant who attended to give me the Vinegar which unluckily created a new Dialogue of Hints for as far as I could gather by the subsequent Discourse they had dissented the Day before about the Preference of Elder to WineVinegar In the Midst of their Dis∣course there appeared a Dish of Chickens and Sparagrass when the Husband seemed dis∣posed to lay aside all Disputes and looking upon her with a great deal of good Nature said Pray my Dear will you help my Friend to a Wing of the Fowl that lies next you for I think it looks extremely well The Lady instead of answering him addressing her self to me Pray Sir said she do you in  Surrey  reckon the white or the blacklegged Fowls the best I found the Husband changed Co∣lour at the Question and before I could an∣swer asked me Whether we did not call Hops Broom in our Country I quickly found they did not ask Questions so much out of Curiosity as Anger For which Reason I thought fit to keep my Opinion to my self and as an ho∣nest Man ought when he sees Two Friends in  Warmth with each other I took the first Op∣portunity I could to leave them by themselves  You see Sir I have laid before you only small Incidents which are seemingly frivial but take it from a Man who am very well ex∣perienced in this State they are principally Evils of this Nature which make Marriages un∣happy At the same Time that I may do Justice to this excellent Institution I must own to you there are unspeakable Pleasures which are as little regarded in the Computation of the Advantages of Marriage as the others are in the usual Survey that is made of its Mis∣fortunes  Lovemore  and his Wife live together in the happy Possession of each other's Hearts and by that Means have no indifferent Moments but their whole Life is one continued Scene of Delight Their Passion for each other commu∣nicates a certain Satisfaction like that which they themselves are in to all that approach them When she enters the Place where he is you see a Pleasure which he cannot conceal nor he or any one else describe In so consum∣mate an Affection the very Presence of the Person beloved has the Effect of the most a¦greeable Conversation Whether they have Matter to talk of or not they enjoy the Plea∣sures of Society and at the same Time the Free∣dom of Solitude Their ordinary Life is to be preferred to the happiest Moments of other Lovers In a Word they have each of them great Merit live in the Esteem of all who know them and seem but to comply with the Opinions of their Friends in the just Value they have for each other  The TATLER N  o    Ni Vis Boni  In ipsa inesset Forma haec Formam extinguerent  Ter  From  Saturd March  to  Tuesd March    From

genuine Lustre while there is no Colour that can infect their Brightness or give a false Cast to the Water When I was at the Opera the other Night the Assembly of Ladies in Mourn∣ing made me consider them in the same Kind of View A Dress wherein there is so little Variety shows the Face in all its natural Charms and makes one differ from another only as it is more or less beautiful Painters are ever careful of of∣fending against a Rule which is so essential in all just Representation The chief Figure must have the strongest Point of Light and not be injured by any gay Colourings that may draw away the Attention to any less considerable Part of the Picture The present Fashion obliges every Body to be dress'd with Propriety and makes the Ladies Faces the principal Objects of Sight Every beau∣tiful Person shines out in all the Excellence with which Nature has adorned her Gawdy Ribands and glaring Colours being now out of Use the Sex has no Opportunity given them to disfi∣gure themselves which they seldom fail to do whenever it lies in their Power When a Woman comes to her Glass she does not em∣ploy  her Time in making her self look more ad∣vantagiously what she really is but endeavours to be as much another Creature as she possibly can Whether this happens because they stay so long and attend their Work so diligently that they forget the Faces and Persons which they first sate down with or whatever it is they sel∣dom rise from the Toilet the same Women they appeared when they began to dress What Jewel can the Charming  Cleora  place in her Ears that can please her Beholders so much as her Eyes The Cluster of Diamonds upon the Breast can add no Beauty to the fair Chest of Ivory which supports it It may indeed tempt a Man to steal a Woman but never to love her Let  Thalestris  change her self into a Motly Partycoloured Animal The Pearl Necklace the Flowered Stomacher the Artificial Nosegay and Shaded Furbelow may be of Use to attract the Eye of the Beholder and turn it from the Im∣perfections of her Features and Shape But if Ladies will take my Word for it and as they dress to please Men they ought to consult our Fancy rather than their own in this Particular I can ass re them there is nothing touches our Imagination so much as a beautiful Woman in a plain Dress There might be more agreeable Ornaments found in our own Manufacture than any that rise out of the Looms of  Persia  This I know is a very harsh Doctrine to Wo∣mankind who are carried away with every Thing that is showy and with what delights the Eye more than any other Species of Living Creatures whatsoever Were the Minds of the Sex laid open we should find the chief Idea in one to be a Tippet in another a Muff in a Third a Fan and in a Fourth a Fardingal The Me∣mory of an old VisitingLady is so filled with Gloves Silks and Ribands that I can look upon it as nothing else but a Toyshop A Matron of  my Acqaintance complaining of her Daughter's Vanity was observing that

the Carriage of this Fantastical Girl till I was in∣formed by her elder Sister that she had a Pair of striped Garters on This odd Turn of Mind often makes the Sex unhappy and disposes them to be struck with every Thing that makes a Show however trifling and superficial  Many a Lady has fetched a Sigh at the Toss of a Wig and been ruined by the Tapping of a Snuff box It is impossible to describe all the Execution that was done by the ShoulderKnot while that Fashion prevailed or to reckon up all the Virgins that have fallen a Sacrifice to a Pair of fringed Gloves A sincere Heart has not made half so many Conquests as an open Wast∣coat and I should be glad to see an able Head make so good a Figure in a Woman's Company as a Pair of Red Heels A  Grecian  Hero when he was asked whether he could play upon the Lute thought he had made a very good Reply when he answered No but I can make a great City of a little One Notwithstanding his boasted Wisdom I appeal to the Heart of any Toast in Town whether she would not think the Luta∣nist preferable to the Statesman I do not speak this out of any Aversion that I have to the Sex On the contrary I have always had a Tender∣ness for them but I must confess it troubles me very much to see the Generality of them place their Affections on improper Objects and give up all the Pleasures of Life for Gugaws and Trifles  Mrs  Margery Bickerstaff  my great Aunt had a Thousand Pounds to her Portion which our Fa∣mily was desirous of keeping among themselves  and therefore used all possible Means to turn off her Thoughts from Marriage The Method they took was in any Time of Danger to throw a new Gown or Petticoat in her Way When she was about Twenty five Years of Age she fell in Love with a Man of an agreeable Temper and equal Fortune and would certainly have married him had not my Grandfather Sir  Jacob  dressed her up in a Suit of flowered Sattin upon which she set so immoderate a Value upon her self that the Lover was contemned and discarded In the Fortieth Year of her Age she was again smitten but very luckily transferred her Pas∣sion to a Tippet which was presented to her by another Relation who was in the Plot This with a white Sarsenet Hood kept her safe in the Family till Fifty About Sixty which gene∣rally produces a Kind of latter Spring in amo∣rous Constitutions my Aunt  Margery  had again a Colt'sTooth in her Head and would certainly have eloped from the Mansionhouse had not her Brother  Simon  who was a wise Man and a Scho∣lar advised to dress her in Cherrycoloured Ri∣bands which was the only Expedient that could have been found out by the Wit of Man to pre∣serve the Thousand Pounds in our Family Part of which I enjoy at this Time  This Discourse puts me in Mind of an Hu∣morist mentioned by  Horace  called  Eutrapelus  who when he designed to do a Man a Mischief made him a Present of a gay Suit and brings to my Memory another Passage of the same Author when he describes the most ornamental Dress that a Woman can appear in with Two Words  Simplex Munditiis  which I have quoted for the Benefit of my Female Readers  The TATLER N  o    Dii quibus Imperium est Animarum Umbraeque silentes  Et Chaos Phlegethon Loca Nocte Silentia late  Sit mihi Fas audita loqui sit Numine vestro  Pandere Res alta Terra Caligine mersas  Virg  From  Tuesd March  to  Thursd March    From my own Apartment  March  A Man who confines his Speculations to the Time present has but a very narrow Pro∣vince to employ his Thoughts in For this Rea∣son Persons of studious and contemplative Na∣tures often entertain themselves with the History of past Ages or raise Schemes and Conjectures upon Futurity For my own Part I love to range through that Half of Eternity which is still to come rather than look on that which is already run out because I know I have a real Share and Interest in the one whereas all that was trans∣acted in the other can be only Matter of Cu∣riosity to me  Upon this Account I have been always very much delighted with meditating on the Soul's Immortality and in reading the several Notions which the wisest of Men both ancient and mo∣dern have entertained on that Subject What the Opinions of the greatest Philosophers have been I have several times hinted at and shall give an Account of them from Time to Time as Occasion requires It may likewise be worth while to consider what Men of the most exalted Genius and elevated Imagination have thought of this Matter Among these  Homer  stands up as a Prodigy of Mankind that looks down upon the rest of Humane Creatures as a Species beneath him Since he is the most ancient Hea∣then  Author we may guess from his Relation what were the common Opinions in his Time concerning the State of the Soul after Death  Ulysses  he tells us made a Voyage to the Re∣gions of the Dead in order to consult  Tiresias  how he should return to his own Country and recommend himself to the Favour of the Gods The Poet scarce introduces a single Person who doth not suggest some useful Precept to his Rea∣der and designs his Description of the Dead for the Amendment of the Living  Ulysses  after having made a very plenteous Sa∣crifice sate him down by the Pool of Holy Blood which attracted a prodigious Assembly of Ghosts of all Ages and Conditions that hovered about the Hero and feasted upon the Steams of his Oblation The first he knew was the Shade of  Elpenor  who to show the Activity of a Spirit a∣bove that of Body is represented as arrived there long before  Ulysses  notwithstanding the Winds and Seas had contributed all their Force to hasten his Voyage thither This  Elpenor  to inspire the Reader with a Detestation of Drunkenness and at the same Time with a religious Care of doing proper Honours to the Dead describes himself as having broken his Neck in a Debauch of Wine and begs  Ulysses  that for the Repose of his Soul he would build a Monument over him and per∣form Funeral Rites to his Memory  Ulysses  with great Sorrow of Heart promises to fulfil his Re∣quest and is immediately diverted to an Object much more moving than the former The Ghost of his own Mother  Anticlea  whom he still thought living appears to him among the Multi∣tude of Shades that surrounded him and sits down at a small Distance from him by the Lake of Blood without speaking to him or knowing who he was  Ulysses  was exceedingly troubled at the Sight and could not forbear weeping as he look'd upon her But being all along set forth as  a Pattern of consummate Wisdom he makes his Affection give Way to Prudence and therefore upon his seeing  Tiresias  does not reveal himself to his Mother till he had consulted that great Prophet who was the Occasion of this his De∣scent into the Empire of the Dead  Tiresias  ha∣ving cautioned him to keep himself and his Com∣panions free from the Guilt of Sacrilege and to pay his Devotions to all the Gods promises him a safe Return to his Kingdom and Family and a happy old Age in the Enjoyment of them  The Poet having thus with great Art kept the Curiosity of the Reader in Suspence represents his wise Man after the Dispatch of his Business with  Tiresias  as yielding himself up to the Calls of natural Affection and making himself known to his Mother Her Eyes are no sooner opened but she cries out in Tears  Oh my Son  and en∣quires into the Occasions that brought him thi∣ther and the Fortune that attended him  Ulysses  on the other Hand desires to know what the Sickness was that had sent her into those Regions and the Condition in which she had left his Father his Son and more particu∣larly his Wife She tells him they were all Three inconsolable for his Absence  and as for my self  says she  That was the Sickness of which I died My Impatience for your Return my Anxiety for your Welfare and my Fondness for my Dear  Ulysses  were the only Distempers that prey'd upon my Life and separated my Soul from my Body Ulysses  was melted with these Expressions of Ten∣derness and Thrice endeavoured to catch the Apparition in his Arms that he might hold his Mother to his Bosom and weep over her  This gives the Poet Occasion to describe the Notion the Heathens at that Time had of an un∣bodied Soul in the Excuse which the Mother makes for seeming to withdraw her self from her Son's Embraces  The Soul  says she  is composed  neither of Bones Flesh nor Sinews but leaves be∣hind her all those Incumbrances of Mortality to be consumed on the Funeral Pile As soon as she has thus cast her Burthen she makes her Escape and flies away from it like a Dream  When this melancholy Conversation is at an End the Poet draws up to View as charming a Vision as could enter into Man's Imagination He describes the next who appeared to  Ulysses  to have been the Shades of the finest Women that had ever lived upon the Earth and who had ei∣ther been the Daughters of Kings the Mistresses of Gods or Mothers of Heroes such as  Antiope Alemena Leda Ariadne Iphimedia Eri  hyle  and several others of whom he gives a Catalogue with a short History of their Adventures The beautiful Assembly of Apparitions were all ga∣thered together about the Blood Each of them says  Ulysses  as a gentle Satyr upon Female Va∣nity  giving me an Account of her Birth and Fa∣mily  This Scene of extraordinary Women seems to have been designed by the Poet as a Lecture of Mortality to the whole Sex and to put them in Mind of what they must expect notwithstand∣ing the greatest Perfections and highest Honours they can arrive at  The Circle of Beauties at length disappeared and was succeeded by the Shades of several  Gre∣cian  Heroes who had been engaged with  Ulysses  in the Siege of  Troy  The first that approached was  Agamemnon  the Generalissimo of that great Expedition who at the Appearance of his old Friend wept very bitterly and without saying any Thing to him endeavoured to grasp him by the Hand  Ulysses  who was much moved at the Sight pour'd out a Flood of Tears and ask'd him the Occasion of his Death which  Agamem∣non  related to him in all its Tragical Circumstan∣ces how he was murthered at a Banquet by the Contrivance of his own Wife in Confederacy  with her Adulterer From whence he takes Oc¦casion to reproach the whole Sex after a Man¦ner which would be inexcusable in a Man who had not been so great a Sufferer by them  My Wife  says he  has disgraced all the Women that shall ever be born into the World even those who hereafter shall be innocent Take Care how you grow too fond of your Wife Never tell her all you know If you reveal some Things to her be sure you keep others concealed from her You indeed have nothing to fear from your  Penelope  she will not use you as my Wife has treated me however take Care how you trust a Woman  The Poet in this and other Instances according to the System of many Hea∣then as well as Christian Philosophers shows how Anger Revenge and other Habits which the Soul had contracted in the Body subsist and grow in it under its State of Separation  I am extremely pleased with the Companions which the Poet in the next Description assigns to  Achilles Achilles  says the Hero  came up to me with  Patroclus  and  Antilochus By which we may see that it was  Homer  's Opinion and proba∣bly that of the Age he lived in that the Friend∣ships which are made among the Living will likewise continue among the Dead  Achilles  en∣quires after the Welfare of his Son and of his Father with a Fierceness of the same Character that  Homer  has every where expressed in the Actions of his Life The Passage relating to his Son is so extremely beautiful that I must not omit it  Ulysses  after having described him as wise in Council and active in War and mentioned the Foes whom he had slain in Battle adds an Observation that he himself had made of his Be∣haviour whilst he lay in the Wooden Horse  Most of the Generals  says he  that were with us either wept or trembled As for your Son I neither saw him wipe a Tear from his Cheeks or change his Countenance On the contrary he would often lay  his Hand upon his Sword or grasp his Spear as impatient to employ them against the  Trojans He then informs his Father of the great Honour and Rewards which he had purchased before  Troy  and of his Return from it without a Wound The Shade of  Achilles  says the Poet was so pleased with the Account he received of his Son that he enquired no further but stalked away with more than ordinary Majesty over the green Meadow that lay before them  This last Circumstance of a deceased Father's rejoicing in the Behaviour of his Son is very finely contrived by  Homer  as an Incentive to Virtue and made use of by none that I know besides himself  The Description of  Ajax  which follows and his refusing to speak to  Ulysses  who had won the Armour of  Achilles  from him and by that Means occasioned his Death is admired by every one that reads it When  Ulysses  relates the Sullen∣ness of his Deportment and considers the Great∣ness of the Hero he expresses himself with ge∣nerous and noble Sentiments  Oh that I had never gained a Prize which cost the Life of so brave a Man as  Ajax  Who for the Beauty of his Person and Greatness of his Actions was inferior to none but the Divine  Achilles The same noble Con∣descension which never dwells but in truly great Minds and such as  Homer  would represent that of  Ulysses  to have been discovers it self likewise in the Speech which he made to the Ghost of  Ajax  on that Occasion  Oh  Ajax says he  Will you keep your Resentments even after Death What Destructions hath this fatal Armour brought upon the  Greeks  by robbing them of you who were their Bulwark and Defence  Achilles  is not more bitter∣ly lamented among us than you Impute not then your Death to any one but  Jupiter  who out of his Anger to the  Greeks  took you away from among them Let me entreat you to approach me restrain  the Fierceness of your Wrath and the Greatness of your Soul and bear what I have to say to you Ajax  without making a Reply turned his Back upon him and retired into a Crowd of Ghosts  Ulysses  after all these Visions took a View of those impious Wretches who lay in Tortures for the Crimes they had committed upon the Earth whom he describes under all the Varieties of Pain as so many Marks of Divine Vengeance to deter others from following their Example He then tells us That notwithstanding he had a great Curiosity to see the Hero's that lived in the Ages before him the Ghosts began to ga∣ther about him in such prodigious Multitudes and with such a Confusion of Voices that his Heart trembled as he saw himself amidst so great a Scene of Horrors He adds That he was afraid lest some hideous Spectre should ap∣pear to him that might terrify him to Distraction and therefore withdrew in Time  I question not but my Reader will be pleased with this Description of a future State repre∣sented by such a noble and fruitful Imagination that had nothing to direct it besides the Light of Nature and the Opinions of a dark and ig∣norant Age  The TATLER N  o    Bambalio Clanger Stridor Taratantara Murmur  Farn Rhet  From  Thursd March  to  Saturd April    From my own Apartment  March  I Have heard of a very valuable Picture where∣in all the Painters of the Age in which it was drawn are represented sitting together in a Cir∣cle  and joining in a Consort of Musick Each of them plays upon such a particular Instrument as is the most suitable to his Character and ex∣presses that Style and Manner of Painting which is peculiar to him The famous CupolaPainter of those Times to show the Grandeur and Bold∣ness of his Figures hath a Horn in his Mouth which he seems to wind with great Strength and Force On the contrary an eminent Artist who wrought up his Pictures with the greatest Accu∣racy and gave them all those delicate Touches which are apt to please the nicest Eye is repre∣sented as tuning a Theorbo The same Kind of Humour runs through the whole Piece  I have often from this Hint imagined to my self that different Talents in Discourse might be shadowed out after the same Manner by different Kinds of Musick and that the several conversa∣ble Parts of Mankind in this great City might be cast into proper Characters and Divisions as they resemble several Instruments that are in Use among the Masters of Harmony Of these therefore in their Order and First of the Drum  Your Drums are the Blusterers in Conversation that with a loud Laugh unnatural Mirth and a Torrent of Noise domineer in publick Assem∣blies overbear Men of Sense stun their Com∣panions and fill the Place they are in with a rat∣ling Sound that hath seldom any Wit Humour or good Breeding in it The Drum notwith∣standing by this boisterous Vivacity is very proper to impose upon the Ignorant and in Conversation with Ladies who are not of the finest Tast often passes for a Man of Mirth and Wit and for wonderful pleasant Company I need not observe that the Emptiness of the Drum very much contributes to its Noise  The Lute is a Character directly opposite to the Drum that sounds very finely by it self or  in a very small Consort Its Notes are exquisite∣ly sweet and very low easily drowned in a Multitude of Instruments and even lost among a few unless you give a particular Attention to it A Lute is seldom heard in a Company of more then Five whereas a Drum will show it self to Advantage in an Assembly of Five hun∣dred The Lutanists therefore are Men of a fine Genius uncommon Reflection great Affability and esteemed chiefly by Persons of a good Tast who are the only proper Judges of so delightful and soft a Melody  The Trumpet is an Instrument that has in it no Compass of Musick or Variety of Sound but is notwithstanding very agreeable so long as it keeps within its Pitch It has not above Four or Five Notes which are however very pleasing and capable of exquisite Turns and Modulations The Gentlemen who fall under this Denomina∣tion are your Men of the most fashionable Edu∣cation and refined Breeding who have learned a certain Smoothness of Discourse and Sprightli∣ness of Air from the polite Company they have kept but at the same Time have shallow Parts weak Judgments and a short Reach of Under∣standing A Playhouse a DrawingRoom a Ball a VisitingDay or a Ring at  HidePark  are the few Notes they are Masters of which they touch upon in all Conversations The Trumpet how∣ever is a necessary Instrument about a Court and a proper Enlivener of a Consort tho' of no great Harmony by it self  Violins are the lively forward importunate Wits that distinguish themselves by the Flou∣rishes of Imagination Sharpness of Repartee Glances of Satyr and bear away the upper Part in every Consort I cannot however but observe That when a Man is not dispos'd to hear Musick there is not a more disagreeable Sound in Har∣mony than that of a Violin  There is another Musical Instrument which is more frequent in this Nation than any other I mean your BassViol which grumbles in the Bottom of the Consort and with a surly Mascu∣line Sound strengthens the Harmony and tem∣pers the Sweetness of the several Instruments that play along with it The BassViol is an In∣strument of a quiet different Nature to the Trum∣pet and may signifie Men of rough Sense and un∣polish'd Parts who do not love to hear themselves talk but sometimes break out with an agreeable Bluntless unexpected Wit and su  ly Pleasantries to the no small Diversion of their Friends and Companions In short I look upon every sen∣sible trueborn  Britain  to be naturally a BassViol  As for your Rural Wits who talk with great Eloquence and Alacrity of Foxes Hounds Hor∣ses Quickset Hedges and SixBar Gates double Ditches and broken Necks I am in Doubt whether I should give them a Place in the con∣versable World However if they will content themselves with being raised to the Dignity of HuntingHorns I shall desire for the future that they may be known by that Name  I must not here omit the Bagpipe Species that will entertain you from Morning to Night with the Repetition of a few Notes which are play'd over and over with the perpetual Humming of a Drone running underneath them These are your dull heavy tedious Story Tellers the Load and Burthen of Conversations that set up for Men of Importance by knowing secret History and giving an Account of Transactions that whether they ever passed in the World or not doth not signify an Halfpenny to its Instruction or its Wel∣fare Some have observed That the  Northern  Parts of this Island are more particularly fruitful in Bagpipes  There are so very few Persons who are Masters in every Kind of Conversation and can talk on all Subjects that I don't know whether we should make a distinct Species of them Never∣theless that my Scheme may not be defective for the Sake of those few who are endowed with such extraordinary Talents I shall allow them to be Harpsicords a Kind of Musick which every one knows is a Consort by it self  As for your PassingBells who look upon Mirth as Criminal and talk of nothing but what is melancholy in it self and mortifying to Hu∣mane Nature I shall not mention them  I shall likewise pass over in Silence all the Rabble of Mankind that crowd our Streets Cof∣feehouses Feasts and publick Tables I can∣not call their Discourse Conversation but rather something that is practised in Imitation of it For which Reason if I would describe them by any Musical Instrument it should be by those modern Inventions of the Bladder and String Tongs and Key MarrowBone and Cleaver  My Reader will doubtless observe That I have only touched here upon Male Instruments ha∣ving reserved my Female Consort to another Oc∣casion If he has a Mind to know where these several Characters are to be met with I could direct him to a whole Club of Drums not to mention another of Bagpipes which I have be∣fore given some Account of in my Description of our Nightly Meetings in  SheerLane  The Lutes may often be met with in Couples upon the Banks of a Chrystal Stream or in the Retreats of shady Woods and flowry Meadows which for different Reasons are likewise the great Re∣sort of your HuntingHorns BassViols are fre∣quently to be found over a Glass of stale Beer and a Pipe of Tobacco whereas those who set up for Violins seldom fail to make their Appea∣rance at  Will  's once every Evening You may  meet with a Trumpet any where on the other Side of  CharingCross  That we may draw something for our Advan∣tage in Life out of the foregoing Discourse I must entreat my Reader to make a narrow Search into his Life and Conversation and upon his lea∣ving any Company to examine himself seri∣ously whether he has behaved himself in it like a Drum or a Trumpet a Violin or a BassViol and accordingly endeavour to mend his Musick for the future For my own Part I must confess I was a Drum for many Years nay and a very noisy one till having polished my self a little in good Company I threw as much of the Trum∣pet into my Conversation as was possible for a Man of an impetuous Temper by which Mixture of different Musicks I look upon my self during the Course of many Years to have resembled a Tabor and Pipe I have since very much endea∣voured at the Sweetness of the Lute but in Spight of all my Resolutions I must confess with great Confusion that I find my self daily degenerating into a Bagpipe whether it be the Effect of my old Age or of the Company I keep I know not All that I can do is to keep a Watch over my Conversation and to silence the Drone as soon as I find it begin to hum in my Discourse being determined ra∣ther to hear the Notes of others than to play out of Time and incroach upon their Parts in the Consort by the Noise of so tiresome an In∣strument  I shall conclude this Paper with a Letter which I received last Night from a Friend of mine who knows very well my Notions upon this Subject and invites me to pass the Even∣ing at his House with a select Company of Friends in the following Words  Dear  Isaac  I Intend to have a Consort at my House this Evening having by great Chance got a Harp∣sicord which I am sure will entertain you very agreeably There will be likewise Two Lutes and a Trumpet Let me beg you to put your self in Tune and believe me  Your very faithful Servant  Nicholas Humdrum  The TATLER N  o    Obscuris Vera involvens  Virg Aen L  From  Saturday April  to  Tuesday April    From my own Apartment  April  WE have already examined  Homer  's De∣scription of a Future State and the Con∣dition in which he hath placed the Souls of the Deceased I shall in this Paper make some Ob∣servations on the Account which  Virgil  hath gi∣ven us of the same Subject who besides a Great∣ness of Genius had all the Lights of Philosophy and Humane Learning to assist and guide him in his Discoveries  Aeneas  is represented as descending into the Empire of Death with a Prophetess by his Side who instructs him in the Secrets of those lower Regions  Upon the Confines of the Dead and before the very Gates of this infernal World  Virgil  describes several Inhabitants whose Natures are wonder∣fully suited to the Situation of the Place as be∣ing either the Occasions or Resemblances of  Death Of the first Kind are the Shadows of Sickness Old Age Fear Famine and Poverty Apparitions very terrible to behold with seve∣ral others as Toil War Contention and Dis∣cord which contribute all of them to people this common Receptacle of humane Souls As this was likewise a very proper Residence for every Thing that resembles Death the Poet tells us That Sleep whom he represents as a near Relation to Death has likewise his Habitation in these Quarters and describes in them a huge gloomy ElmTree which seems a very proper Ornament for the Place and is possessed by an innumerable Swarm of Dreams that hang in Clusters under every Leaf of it He then gives us a List of imaginary Persons who very natu∣rally lie within the Shadow of the DreamTree as being of the same Kind of Make in them∣selves and the Materials or to use  Shakespeare  's Phrase the Stuff of which Dreams are made Such are the Shades of the Giant with a Hun∣dred Hands and of his Brother with Three Bo∣dies of the doubleshap'd  Centaur  and  Sylla  the  Gorgon  with Snakey Hair the  Harpy  with a Woman's Face and Lion's Talons the Seven∣headed  Hydra  and the  Chimaera  which breaths forth a Flame and is a Compound of Three Animals These several mix'd Natures the Creatures of Imagination are not only introdu∣ced with great Art after the Dreams but as they are planted at the very Entrance and with∣in the very Gates of those Regions do probably denote the wild Deliriums and Extravagancies of Fancy which the Soul usually falls into when she is just upon the Verge of Death  Thus far  Aeneas  travels in an Allegory The rest of the Description is drawn with great Ex∣actness according to the Religion of the Hea∣thens and the Opinions of the  Platonick  Philo∣sophy I shall not trouble my Reader with a com∣mon  dull Story that gives an Account why the Heathens first of all supposed a Ferryman in Hell and his Name to be  Charon  but must not pass over in Silence the Point of Doctrine which  Vir∣gil  hath very much insisted upon in this Book That the Souls of those who are unburied are not permitted to go over into their respective Places of Rest till they have wandered a Hun∣dred Years upon the Banks of  Styx  This was probably an Invention of the Heathen Priest∣hood to make the People extremely careful of performing proper Rights and Ceremonies to the Memory of the Dead I shall not however with the infamous Scribblers of the Age take an Oc∣casion from such a Circumstance to run into Declamations against Priestcraft but rather look upon it even in this Light as a Religious Artifice to raise in the Minds of Men an Esteem for the Memory of their Forefathers and a Desire to recommend themselves to that of Posterity as also to excite in them an Ambition of imitating the Virtues of the Deceased and to keep alive in their Thoughts the Sense of the Soul's Immor∣tality In a Word we may say in Defence of the severe Opinions relating to the Shades of unburied Persons what hath been said by some of our Divines in regard to the rigid Doctrines concerning the Souls of such who die without being initiated into our Religion That supposing they should be erroneous they can do no Hurt to the Dead and will have a good Effect upon the Living in making them cautious of neg∣lecting such necessary Solemnities  Charon  is no sooner appeas'd and the Triple∣headed Dog laid asleep but  Aeneas  makes his Entrance into the Dominions of  Pluto  There are Three Kinds of Persons described as being situated on the Borders and I can give no Rea∣son for their being stationed there in so particular a Manner but because they none of them seem  to have had a proper Right to a Place among the Dead as not having run out the whole Thread of their Days and finished the Term of Life that had been allotted them upon Earth The First of these are the Souls of Infants who are snatched away by untimely Ends The Second are of those who are put to Death wrongfully and by an unjust Sentence and the Third of those who grew weary of their Lives and laid violent Hands upon themselves As for the Second of these  Virgil  adds with great Beauty That  Mi∣nos  the Judge of the Dead is employed in giving them a Rehearing and assigning them their several Quarters suitable to the Parts they acted in Life The Poet after having mentioned the Souls of those unhappy Men who destroyed themselves breaks out into a fine Exclamation  Oh how gladly  says he  would they now endure Life with all its Miseries But the Destinies forbid their Return to Earth and the Waters of  Styx  sur∣round them with Nine Streams that are unpassable  It is very remarkable that  Virgil  notwithstand∣ing Selfmurther was so frequent among the Heathens and had been practised by some of the greatest Men in the very Age before him hath here represented it as so heinous a Crime But in this Particular he was guided by the Doctrines of his great Master  Plato  who says on this Sub∣ject That a Man is placed in his Station of Life like a Soldier in his proper Post which he is not to quit whatever may happen until he is called off by his Commander who planted him in it  There is another Point in the Platonick Philo∣sophy which  Virgil  has made the Groundwork of the greatest Part in the Piece we are now exa∣mining having with wonderful Art and Beauty materializ'd if I may so call it a Scheme of ab∣stracted Notions and cloathed the most nice re∣fined Conceptions of Philosophy in Sensible Ima∣ges  and Poetical Representations The Plato∣nists tell us That the Soul during her Resi∣dence in the Body contracts many virtuous and vicious Habits so as to become a beneficient mild charitable or an angry malicious re∣vengeful Being A Substance inflam'd with Lust Avarice and Pride or on the contrary bright∣en'd with pure generous and humble Disposi∣tions That these and the like Habits of Virtue and Vice growing into the very Essence of the Soul survive and gather Strength in her after her Dissolution That the Torments of a vicious Soul in a future State arise principally from those importunate Passions which are not capable of being gratified without a Body and that on the contrary the Happiness of virtuous Minds very much consists in their being employed in sublime Speculatins innocent Diversions sociable Af∣fections and all the Extasies of Passion and Rap∣ture which are agreeable to reasonable Na∣tures and of which they gained a Relish in this Life  Upon this Foundation the Poet raises that beautiful Description of the secret Haunts and Walks which he tells us are inhabited by de∣ceased Lovers  Not far from hence says he lies a great Wast of Plains that are called the Fields of Melan∣choly In these there grows a Forrest of Myrtle divided into many shady Retirements and cover∣ed Walks and inhabited by the Souls of those who pined away with Love The Passion says he continues with them after Death He then gives a List of this languishing Tribe in which his own  Dido  makes the principal Figure and is describ'd as living in this soft Romantick Scene with the Shade of her first Husband  Sy∣chaeus  The Poet in the next Place mentions another Plain that was peopled with the Ghosts of War∣riors  as still delighting in each other's Com∣pany and pleased with the Exercise of Arms He there represents the  Graecian  Generals and common Soldiers who perished in the Siege of  Troy  as drawn up in Squadrons and terrified at the Approach of  Aeneas  which renewed in them those Impressions of Fear they had before re∣ceived in Battle with the  Trojans  He afterwards likewise upon the same Notion gives a View of the  Trojan  Heroes who lived in former Ages amidst a visionary Scene of Chariots and Arms flowry Meadows shining Spears and generous Steeds which he tells us were their Pleasures upon Earth and now make up their Happiness in  Elysium  For the same Reason also he men∣tions others as singing Paeans and Songs of Tri∣umph amidst a beautiful Grove of Laurel The Chief of the Consort was the Poet  Musaeus  who stood inclosed with a Circle of Admirers and rose by the Head and Shoulders above the Throng of Shades that surrounded him The Habita∣tions of unhappy Spirits to shew the Duration of their Torments and the desperate Condition they are in are represented as guarded by a Fury moated round with a Lake of Fire streng∣thened with Towers of Iron encompassed with a triple Wall and fortified with Pillars of Ada∣mant which all the Gods together are not able to heave from their Foundations The Noise of Stripes the Clank of Chains and the Groans of the Tortured strike the poius  Aeneas  with a kind of Horror The Poet afterwards divides the Criminals into two Classes The first and blackest Catalogue consists of such as were guil∣ty of Outrages against the Gods and the next of such who were convicted of Injustice between Man and Man The greatest Number of whom says the Poet are those who followed the Dictates of Avarice  It was an Opinion of the Platonists That the Souls of Men having contracted in the Body great Stains and Pollutions of Vice and Ignorance there were several Purgations and Cleansings ne∣cessary to be passed through both here and here∣after in order to refine and purify them  Virgil  to give this Thought likewise a Cloath∣ing of Poetry describes some Spirits as bleaching in the Winds others as cleansing under great Falls of Waters and others as purging in Fire to recover the primitive Beauty and Purity of their Natures  It was likewise an Opinion of the same Sect of Philosophers That the Souls of all Men exist in a separate State long before their Union with their Bodies and that upon their Immersion in∣to Flesh they forget every Thing which passed in the State of Preexistence so that what we here call Knowledge is nothing else but Memory or the Recovery of those Things which we knew before  In pursuance of this Scheme  Virgil  gives us a View of several Souls who to prepare them∣selves for living upon Earth flock about the Banks of the River  Lethe  and swill themselves with the Waters of Oblivion  The same Scheme gives him an Opportunity of making a noble Compliment to his Countrymen where  Anchises  is represented taking a Survey of the long Train of Heroes that are to descend from him and giving his Son  Aeneas  an Account of all the Glories of his Race  I need not mention the Revolution of the Pla∣tonick Year which is but just touched upon in this Book and as I have consulted no Authors Thoughts in this Explication shall be very well pleased if it can make the noblest Piece of the most accomplished Poet more agreeable to my female Readers when they think sit to look in∣to  Dryden  's Translation of it  The TATLER N  o    Aliena Negotia curat  Excussus propriis  Hor  From  Tuesday April  to  Thursday April    From my own Apartment  April  THere lived some Years since within my Neighbourhood a very grave Person an Upholsterer who seemed a Man of more than ordinary Application to Business He was a very early Riser and was often abroad Two or Three Hours before any of his Neighbours He had a particular Carefulness in the knitting of his Brows and a kind of Impatience in all his Motions that plainly discovered he was always intent on Matters of Importance Upon my Enquiry in∣to his Life and Conversation I found him to be the greatest Newsmonger in our Quarter that he rose before Day to read the  PostMan  and that he would take Two or Three Turns to the other End of the Town before his Neighbours were up to see if there were any  Dutch  Mails come in He had a Wife and several Children but was much more inquisitive to know what passed in  Poland  than in his own Family and was in greater Pain and Anxiety of Mind for King  Augustus  's Welfare than that of his nearest Rela∣tions He looked extremely thin in a Dearth of News and never enjoyed himself in a Westerly Wind This indefatigable kind of Life was the Ruin of his Shop for about the Time that his Favourite Prince left the Crown of  Poland  he broke and disappeared  This Man and his Affairs had been long out of my Mind till about Three Days ago as I was walking in St  James  's Park I heard some body at a Distance hemming after me And who should it be but my old Neighbour the Upholsterer I saw he was reduced to extreme Poverty by certain shabby Superfluities in his Dress For notwithstand∣ing that it was a very sultry Day for the Time of the Year he wore a loose great Coat and a Muff with a long CampaignWig out of Curl to which he had added the Ornament of a Pair of black Garters buckled under the Knee Upon his coming up to me I was going to enquire into his present Circumstances but was pre∣vented by his asking me with a Whisper Whe∣ther the last Letters brought any Accounts that one might rely upon from  Bender  I told him None that I heard of and asked him Whether he had yet married his eldest Daughter He told me No But pray says he tell me sincerely What are your Thoughts of the King of  Sweden  For tho' his Wife and Children were starving I found his chief Concern at present was for this great Monarch I told him That I looked upon him as one of the first Heroes of the Age But pray says he do you think there is any Thing in the Story of his Wound And finding me sur∣prised at the Question Nay says he I only pro∣pose it to you I answered That I thought there was no Reason to doubt of it But why in the Heel says he more than in any other Part of the Body Because says I the Bullet chanced to light there  This extraordinary Dialogue was no s one ended but he began to launch out into a long Dissertation upon the Affairs of the  North  and after having spent some Time on them he told me He was in a great Perplexity how to recon∣cile the  Supplement  with the  EnglishPost  and had been just now examining what the other Papers  say upon the same Subject The  Daily Courant  says he has these Words  We have Advices from very good Hands That a certain Prince has some Matters of great Importance under Consideration  This is very mysterious but the  PostBoy  leaves us more in the Dark for he tells us  That there are private Intimations of Measures taken by a certain Prince which Time will bring to Light  Now the  PostMan  says he who uses to be very clear refers to the same News in these Words  The late Conduct of a certain Prince affords great Matter of Speculation  This certain Prince says the Upholsterer whom they are all so cautious of naming I take to beUpon which tho' there was no Body near us he whispered something in my Ear which I did not hear or think worth my while to make him repeat  We were now got to the upper End of the  Mall  where were Three or Four very odd Fel∣lows sitting together upon the Bench These I found were all of them Politicians who used to Sun themselves in that Place every Day about DinnerTime Observing them to be Curiosities in their Kind and my Friend's Acquaintance I sat down among them  The chief Politician of the Bench was a great Asserter of Paradoxes He told us with a seem∣ing Concern That by some News he had lately read from  Muscovy  it appeared to him that there was a Storm gathering in the Black Sea which might in Time do Hurt to the Naval Forces of this Nation To this he added That for his Part he could not wish to see the Turk driven out of  Europe  which he believed could not but be prejudicial to our Woollen Manufacture He then told us That he looked upon those extraor∣dinary Revolutions which had lately happened in these Parts of the World to have risen chiefly from Two Persons who were not much talked of and those says he are Prince  Menzikoff  and  the Dutchess of  Mirandola  He back'd his As∣sertions with so many broken Hints and such a Show of Depth and Wisdom that we gave our selves up to his Opinions  The Discourse at length fell upon a Point which seldom escapes a Knot of trueborn  English∣men  Whether in Case of a Religious War the Protestants would not be too strong for the Pa∣pists This we unanimously determined on the Protestant Side One who sat on my Right Hand and as I found by his Discourse had been in the  WestIndies  assured us That it would be a very easie Matter for the Protestants to beat the Pope at Sea and added That whenever such a War does break out it must turn to the Good of the  Leeward  Islands Upon this one who sat at the End of the Bench and as I afterwards found was the Geographer of the Company said That in case the Papists should drive the Protestants from these Parts of  Europe  when the worst came to the worst it would be impossible to beat them out of  Norway  and  Greenland  provided the Nor∣thern Crowns hold together and the Czar of  Muscavy  stand Neuter  He further told us for our Comfort That there were vast Tracts of Land about the Pole in∣habited neither by Protestants nor Papists and of greater Extent than all the  Roman  Catholick Do∣minions in  Europe  When we had fully discussed this Point my Friend the Upholsterer began to exert himself upon the present Negotiations of Peace in which he deposed Princes settled the Bounds of King∣doms and ballanced the Power of  Europe  with great Justice and Impartiality  I at length took my Leave of the Company and was going away but had not been gone Thirty Yards before the Upholsterer hemm'd again after me Upon his advancing towards me with a Whisper I expected to hear some secret  Piece of News which he had not thought fit to communicate to the Bench but instead of that he desired me in my Ear to lend him Half a Crown In Compassion to so needy a Statesman and to dissipate the Confusion I found he was in I told him if he pleased I would give him Five Shillings to receive Five Pounds of him when the Great Turk was driven out of  Const intinople  which he very readily accepted but not before he had laid down to me the Impossibility of such an Event as the Affairs of  Europe  now stand  This Paper I design for the particular Benefit of those worthy Citizens who live more in a Coffeehouse than in their Shops and whose Thoughts are so taken up with the Affairs of the Allies that they forget their Customers  The TATLER N  o    Sequitur{que} Patrem non passibus aequis  Virg  From  Thursd April  to  Saturd April    From my own Apartment  April  WE have already described out of  Homer  the Voyage of  Ulysses  to the Infernal Shades with the several Adventures that attended it If we look into the beautiful Romance published not many Years since by the Archbishop of  Cam∣bray  we may see the Son of  Ulysses  bound on the same Expedition and after the same Manner making his Discoveries among the Regions of the Dead The Story of  Telemachus  is formed altogether in the Spirit of  Homer  and will give an unlearned Reader a Notion of that great Poet's Manner of Writing more than any Translation of him can possibly do As it was written for  the Instruction of a young Prince who may one Day sit upon the Throne of  France  the Author took Care to suit the several Parts of his Story and particularly the Description we are now en∣tring upon to the Character and Quality of his Pupil For which Reason he insists very much on the Misery of bad and the Happiness of good Kings in the Account he hath given of Punish∣ments and Rewards in the other World  We may however observe notwithstanding the Endeavours of this great and learned Author to copy after the Style and Sentiments of  Homer  that there is a certain Tincture of Christianity running through the whole Relation The Prelate in several Places mixes himself with the Poet so that his future State puts me in Mind of  Michael Angelo  's Last Judgment where  Charon  and his Boat are represented as bearing a Part in the dreadful Solemnities of that great Day  Telemachus  after having passed through the dark Avenues of Death in the Retinue of  Mer∣cury  who every Day delivers up a certain Tale of Ghosts to the Ferryman of  Styx  is admitted into the Infernal Bark Among the Companions of his Voyage is the Shade of  Nabopharzon  a King of  Babylon  and Tyrant of all the  East  Among the Ceremonies and Pomps of his Funeral there were Four Slaves sacrificed according to the Cu∣stom of the Country in order to attend him a∣mong the Shades The Author having described this Tyrant in the most odious Colours of Pride Insolence and Cruelty tells us That his Four Slaves instead of serving him after Death were perpetually insulting him with Reproaches and Affronts for his past Usage That they spurn'd him as he lay upon the Ground and forc'd him to show his Face which he would fain have co∣vered as lying under all the Confusions of Guilt and Infamy and in short that they kept him  bound in a Chain in order to drag him before the Tribunal of the Dead  Telemachus  upon looking out of the Bark sees all the Strand covered with an innumerable Mul∣titude of Shades who upon his jumping ashore immediately vanished He then pursues his Course to the Palace of  Pluto  who is described as seated on his Throne in terrible Majesty with  Proserpine  by his Side At the Foot of his Throne was the pale hideous Spectre who by the Ghastliness of his Visage and the Nature of the Apparitions that surrounded him discovers him∣self to be Death His Attendants are Melan∣choly Distrust Revenge Hatred Avarice De∣spair Ambition Envy Impiety with frightful Dreams and waking Cares which are all drawn very naturally in proper Actions and Postures The Author with great Beauty places near his frightful Dreams an Assembly of Phantoms which are often employed to terrify the Living by appearing in the Shape and Likeness of the Dead  The young Hero in the next Place takes a Survey of the different Kinds of Criminals that lay in Torture among Clouds of Sulphur and Torrents of Fire The First of these were such as had been guilty of Impieties which every one hath an Horror for To which is added a Catalogue of such Offenders that scarce appear to be faulty in the Eyes of the Vulgar Among these says the Author are malicious Criticks that have endeavoured to cast a Blemish upon the Perfections of others with whom he likewise places such as have often hurt the Reputation of the Innocent by passing a rash Judgment on their Actions without knowing the Occasion of them These Crimes says he are more se∣verely punished after Death because they gene∣rally meet with Impunity upon Earth  Telemachus  after having taken a Survey of se∣veral other Wretches in the same Circumstances arrives at that Region of Torments in which wicked Kings are punished The e are very fine Strokes of Imagination in the Description which he gives of this unhappy Multitude He tells us That on one Side of them there stood a re∣vengesul Fury thundering in their Ears incessant Repetitions of all the Crimes they had commit∣ted upon Earth with the Aggravations of Am∣bition Vanity Hardness of Heart and all those secret Affections of Mind that enter into the Composition of a Tyrant At the same Time she holds up to them a large Mirror in which every one sees himself represented in the natural Horror and Deformity of his Character On the other Side of them stands another Fury that with an insulting Derision repeats to them all the Praises that their Flatterers had bestowed upon them while they sat upon their respective Thrones She too says the Author presents a Mirror before their Eyes in which every one sees himself adorn'd with all those Beauties and Perfections in which they had been drawn by the Vanity of their own Hearts and the Flattery of others To punish them for the Wantonness of the Cruelty which they formerly exercised they are now delivered up to be treated according to the Fancy and Caprice of several Slaves who have here an Opportunity of tyrannizing in their Turns  The Author having given us a Description of these ghastly Spectres who says he are always calling upon Death and are placed under the Distillation of that burning Vengeance which falls upon them Drop by Drop and is never to be exhausted leads us into a pleasing Scene of Groves filled with the Melody of Birds and the Odours of a Thousand different Plants These Groves are represented as rising among a great  many flowry Meadows and watered with Streams that diffuse a perpetual Freshness in the midst of an eternal Day and a neverfading Spring This says the Author was the Habitation of those good Princes who were Friends of the Gods and Parents of the People Among these  Telemachus  converses with the Shade of one of his Ancestors who makes a most agreeable Re∣lation of the Joys of  Elysium  and the Nature of its Inhabitants The Residence of  Sesostris  a∣mong these happy Shades with his Character and present Employment is drawn in a very lively Manner and with a great Elevation of Thought  The Description of that pure and gentle Light which overflows these happy Regions and cloaths the Spirits of these virtuous Persons hath something in it of that Enthusiasm which this Author was accused of by his Enemies in the Church of  Rome  but however it may look in Religion it makes a very beautiful Figure in Poetry  The Rays of the Sun says he are Darkness in Comparison with this Light which rather de∣serves the Name of Glory than that of Light It pierces the thickest Bodies in the same Man∣ner as the Sun Beams pass through Chrystal It strengthens the Sight instead of dazzling it and nourishes in the most inward Recesses of the Mind a perpetual Serenity that is not to be ex∣press'd It enters and incorporates it self with the very Substance of the Soul The Spirits of the Blessed feel it in all their Senses and in all their Perceptions It produces a certain Source of Peace and Joy that arises in them for ever running through all the Faculties and refresh∣ing all the Desires of the Soul External Plea∣sures and Delights with all their Charms and Allurements are regarded with the utmost In∣difference  and Neglect by these happy Spirits who have this great Principle of Pleasure with∣in them drawing the whole Mind to its self calling off their Attention from the most de∣lightful Objects and giving them all the Tran∣sports of Inebriation without the Confusion and the Folly of it  I have here only mentioned some MasterTouches of this admirable Piece because the Original it self is understood by the greater Part of my Readers I must confess I take a parti∣cular Delight in these Prospects of Futurity whether grounded upon the probable Suggestions of a fine Imagination or the more severe Con∣clusions of Philosophy as a Man loves to hear all the Discoveries or Conjectures relating to a Foreign Country which he is at some Time to inhabit Prospects of this Nature lighten the Burden of any present Evil and refresh us under the worst and lowest Circumstances of Mortality They extinguish in us both the Fear and Envy of Humane Grandeur Insolence shrinks its Head Power disappears Pain Po∣verty and Death fly before them In short the Mind that is habituated to the lively Sense of an Hereafter can hope for what is the most terrifying to the Generality of Mankind and re∣joice in what is the most afflicting  The TATLER N  o    Facile est inventis addere  From  Saturd April  to  Tuesd April    From my own Apartment  April  I Was last Night in an Assembly of very Fine Women How I came among them is of no great Importance to the Reader I shall only let him know that I was betrayed into so good Com∣pany by the Device of an old Friend who had promised to give some of his Female Acquain∣tance a Sight of Mr  Bickerstaff  Upon hearing my Name mentioned a Lady who sat by me told me they had brought together a Female Consort for my Entertainment You must know says she that we all of us look upon our selves to be Mu∣sical Instruments though we do not yet know of what Kind which we hope to learn from you if you will give us Leave to play before you This was followed by a general Laugh which I always look upon as a necessary Flourish in the Opening of a Female Consort They then struck up toge∣ther and play'd a whole Hour upon Two Grounds  viz  the  Trial  and the  Opera  I could not but observe that several of their Notes were more soft and several more sharp than any that ever I heard in a Male Consort though I must con∣fess there was not any Regard to Time nor any of those Rests and Pauses which are frequent in the Harmony of the other Sex Besides that the Musick was generally full and no particular In∣strument permitted to play long by its self  I seemed so very well pleased with what every one said and smiled with so much Complaisance  at all their pretty Fancies that though I did not put one Word into their Discourse I have the Vanity to think they looked upon me as very agreeable Company I then told 'em That if I were to draw the Picture of so many charming Musicians it should be like one I had seen of the Muses with their several Instruments in their Hands Upon which the Lady KettleDrum tos∣sed back her Head and cry'd A very pretty Si∣mile The Consort again revived in which with Nods Smiles and Approbations I bore the Part rather of one who beats the Time than of a Per∣former  I was no sooner retired to my Lodgings but I ran over in my Thoughts the several Characters of this Fair Assembly which I shall give some Account of because they are various in their Kind and may each of them stand as a Sample of a whole Species  The Person who pleased me most was a Flute an Instrument that without any great Compass hath something exquisitely sweet and soft in its Sound It lulls and sooths the Ear and fills it with such a gentle Kind of Melody as keeps the Mind awake without startling it and raises a most agreeable Passion between Transport and Indo∣lence In short the Musick of the Flute is the Conversation of a mild and amiable Woman that has nothing in it very elevated or at the same Time any Thing mean or trivial  I must here observe that the Hautboy is the most perfect of the FluteSpecies which with all the Sweetness of the Sound hath a great Strength and Variety of Notes though at the same Time I must observe that the Hautboy in one Sex is as scarce as the Harpsicord in the other  By the Side of the Flute there sat a Flageolet for so I must call a certain young Lady who fancying her self a Wit despised the Musick of the Flute as low and insipid and would be enter∣taining  the Company with tart illnatured Obser∣vations pert Fancies and little Turns which she imagined to be full of Life and Spirit The Fla∣geolet therefore doth not differ from the Flute so much in the Compass of its Notes as in the Shril∣ness and Sharpness of the Sound We must how∣ever take Notice that the Flageolets among their own Sex are more valued and esteemed than the Flutes  There chanced to be a Coquet in the Consort that with a great many skittish Notes affected Squeaks and studied Inconsistencies distinguish'd her self from the rest of the Company She did not speak a Word during the whole  Trial  but I thought she would never have done upon the  Opera  One while she would break out upon  That hideous King  Then upon the charming Blackmoor Then  Oh that dear Lion  Then would hum over Two or Three Notes then run to the Window to see what Coach was coming The Coquet therefore I must distinguish by that Musical Instrument which is commonly known by the Name of a Kit that is more jiggish than the Fiddle it self and never sounds but to a Dance  The Fourth Person who bore a Part in the Con∣versation was a Prude who stuck to the Trial and was silent upon the whole Opera The Gravi∣ty of her Censures and Composure of her Voice which were often attended with supercilious Casts of the Eye and a seeming Contempt for the Lightness of the Conversation put me in Mind of that ancient serious Matronlike Instrument the Virginal  I must not pass over in Silence a  Lancashire  Hornpipe by which I would signify a young Country Lady who with a great deal of Mirth and Innocence diverted the Company very agree∣ably and if I am not mistaken by that Time the Wildness of her Notes is a little softened  and the Redundancy of her Musick restrained by Conversation and good Company will be im∣proved into one of the most amiable Flutes about the Town Your Romps and BoardingSchool Girls fall likewise under this Denomination  On the RightHand of the Hornpipe sat a  Welsh  Harp an Instrument which very much delights in the Tunes of old Historical Ballads and in ce∣lebrating the Renown'd Actions and Exploits of ancient  British  Heroes By this Instrument I therefore would describe a certain Lady who is one of those Female Historians that upon all Oc∣casions enters into Pedigrees and Descents and finds her self related by some Offshoot or other to almost every great Family in  England  For which Reason she jarrs and is out of Tune very often in Conversation for the Company's Want of due Attention and Respect to her  But the most sonorous Part of our Consort was a SheDrum or as the Vulgar call it a KettleDrum who accompanied her Discourse with Motions of the Body Tosses of the Head and Brandishes of the Fan Her Musick was loud bold and masculine Every Thump she gave alarmed the Company and very often set some Body or other in it a Blushing  The last I shall mention was a certain Roman∣tick Instrument called a  Dulcimer  who talked of nothing but shady Woods flowry Meadows purling Streams Larks and Nightingals with all the Beauties of the Spring and the Pleasures of a Country Life This Instrument hath a fine melancholy Sweetness in it and goes very well with the Flute  I think most of the conversable Part of Wo∣mankind may be found under one of the forego∣ing Divisions but it must be confessed that the Generality of that Sex notwithstanding they have naturally a great Genius for being talkative are not Mistresses of more than one Note with which  however by frequent Repetition they make a greater Sound than those who are possessed of the whole Gammut as may be observed in your La∣rums or Houshold Scolds and in your Castanets or impertinent TittleTattles who have no other Variety in their Discourse but that of talking slower or faster  Upon communicating this Scheme of Musick to an old Friend of mine who was formerly a Man of Gallantry and a Rover he told me That he believed he had been in Love with every In∣strument in my Consort The first that smit him was a Hornpipe who lived near his Father's House in the Country but upon his failing to meet her at an Assize according to Appointment she cast him off His next Passion was for a Ket∣tleDrum whom he fell in Love with at a Play but when he became acquainted with her not finding the Softness of her Sex in her Conversa∣tion he grew cool to her though at the same Time he could not deny but that she behaved her self very much like a Gentlewoman His Third Mistress was a Dulcimer who he found took great Delight in sighing and languishing but would go no further than the Preface of Matri∣mony so that she would never let a Lover have any more of her than her Heart which after ha∣ving won he was forced to leave her as despair∣ing of any further Success I must confess says my Friend I have often considered her with a great deal of Admiration and I find her Plea∣sure is so much in this first Step of an Amour that her Life will pass away in Dream Solitude and Soliloquy till her Decay of Charms makes her snatch at the worst Man that ever pretended to her In the next Place says my Friend I fell in Love with a Kit who led me such a Dance through all the Varieties of a familiar cold fond and indifferent Behaviour that the World began to grow censorious though without any Cause  For which Reason to recover our Reputations we parted by Consent To mend my Hand says he I made my next Application to a Virginal who gave me great Encouragement after her cautious Manner till some malicious Companion told her of my long Passion for the Kit which made her turn me off as a scandalous Fellow At length in Despair says he I betook my self to a  Welsh  Harp who rejected me with Contempt after ha∣ving found that my Great Grandmother was a Brewer's Daughter I found by the Sequel of my Friend's Discourse that he had never aspired to a Hautboy that he had been exasperated by a Fla∣geolet and that to this very Day he pines away for a Flute  Upon the Whole having throughly considered how absolutely necessary it is That Two Instru∣ments which are to play together for Life should be exactly tuned and go in perfect Consort with each other I would propose Matches between the Musick of both Sexes according to the following Table of Marriage  Drum and KettleDrum  Lute and Flute  Harpsicord and Hautboy  Violin and Flageolet  BassViol and Kit  Trumpet and  Welsh  Harp  HuntingHorn and HornPipe  Bagpipe and Castanets

Learning employed to get together good Editions and stock the Libraries of great Men There is not a Sale of Books begins till  Tom Folio  is seen at the Door There is not an Auction where his Name is not heard and that too in the very Nick of Time in the Critical Moment before the last decisive Stroke of the Hammer There is not a Subscrip∣tion goes forward in which  Tom  is not privy to the first rough Draught of the Proposals nor a Catalogue printed that doth not come to him wet from the Press He is an universal Scholar so far as the TitlePage of all Authors knows the Manuscripts in which they were discovered the Editions through which they have passed with the Praises or Censures which they have received from the several Members of the Learned World He has a greater Esteem for  Aldus  and  Elzevir  than for  Virgil  and  Horace  If you talk of  Hero∣dotus  he breaks out into a Panegyrick upon  Harry Stephans  He thinks he gives you an Ac∣count of an Author when he tells you the Sub∣ject he treats of the Name of the Editor and the Year in which it was printed Or if you draw him into further Particulars he cries up the Good∣ness of the Paper extols the Diligence of the Corrector and is transported with the Beauty of the Letter This he looks upon to be sound Learning and substantial Criticism As for those  who talk of the Fineness of Style and the Just∣ness of Thought or describe the Brightness of any particular Passages nay though they write themselves in the Genius and Spirit of the Author they admire  Tom  looks upon them as Men of su∣perficial Learning and flashy Parts  I had Yesterday Morning a Visit from this learned Idiot for that is the Light in which I consider every Pedant when I discovered in him some little Touches of the Coxcomb which I had not before observ'd Being very full of the Fi∣gure which he makes in the Republick of Letters and wonderfully satisfied with his great Stock of Knowledge he gave me broad Intimations that he did not  believe  in all Points as his Forefathers had done He then communicated to me a Thought of a certain Author upon a Passage of  Virgil  's Account of the Dead which I made the Subject of a late Paper This Thought hath ta∣ken very much among Men of  Tom  's Pitch and Understanding though universally exploded by all that know how to construe  Virgil  or have any Relish of Antiquity Not to trouble my Reader with it I found upon the whole that  Tom  did not believe a future State of Rewards and Punish∣ments because  Aeneas  at his leaving the Empire of the Dead passed through the Gate of Ivory and not through that of Horn Knowing that  Tom  had not Sense enough to give up an Opinion which he had once received that he might avoid wrangling I told him That  Virgil  possibly had his Oversights as well as another Author Ah  Mr  Bickerstaff  says he you would have anothe  Opinion of him if you would read him in  Dani  Heinsius  's Edition I have perused him my sel  several Times in that Edition continued he an  after the strictest and most malicious Examina¦tion could find but Two Faults in him One o  them is in the  Aeneids  where there are Tw  Comma's instead of a Parenthesis and anoth  in the Third  Georgick  where you may find a Semicolon turned upside down Perhaps said I these were not  Virgil  's Thoughts but those of the Transcriber I do not design it says  Tom  as a Reflection on  Virgil  On the contrary I know that all the Manuscripts  reclaim  against such a Punctuation Oh Mr  Bickerstaff  says he what would a Man give to see one Simile of  Virgil  writ in his own Hand I asked him which was the Simile he meant but was answered Any Simile in  Virgil  He then told me all the secret History in the Commonwealth of Learning of Modern Pieces that had the Names of ancient Authors an∣nex'd to them of all the Books that were now writing or printing in the several Parts of  Europe  of many Amendments which are made and not yet published and a Thousand other Particulars which I would not have my Memory burthen'd with for a Vatican  At length being fully persuaded that I tho∣roughly admired him and looked upon him as a Prodigy of Learning he took his Leave I know several of  Tom  's Class who are professed Admirers of  Tasso  without understanding a Word of  Italian  and one in particular that carries a  PastorFido  in his Pocket in which I am sure he is acquaint∣ed with no other Beauty but the Clearness of the Character  There is another Kind of Pedant who with all  Tom Folio  's Impertinencies hath greater Super∣structures and Embellishments of  Greek  and  Latin  and is still more insupportable than the other in the same Degree as he is more learned Of this Kind very often are Editors Commentators In∣terpreters Scholiasts and Criticks and in short all Men of deep Learning without common Sense These Persons set a greater Value on themselves for having found out the Meaning of a Passage in  Greek  than upon the Author for having written it nay will allow the Passage it self not to have  any Beauty in it at the same Time that they would be considered as the greatest Men of the Age for having interpreted it They will look with Con∣tempt upon the most beautiful Poems that have been composed by any of their Contemporaries but will lock themselves up in their Studies for a Twelvemonth together to correct publish and expound such Trifles of Antiquity as a modern Author would be contemn'd for Men of the strictest Morals severest Lives and the gravest Professions will write Volumes upon an idle Son∣net that is originally in  Greek  or  Latin  give Edi∣tions of the most immoral Authors and spin out whole Pages upon the various Readings of a lewd Expression All that can be said in Excuse for them is That their Works sufficiently show they have no Tast of their Authors and that what they do in this Kind is out of their great Learn∣ing and not out of any Levity or Lasciviousness of Temper  A Pedant of this Nature is wonderfully well described in Six Lines of  Boileau  with which I shall conclude his Character  Un Pèdant enyvrè de sa vaine science  Tout herisse de Grec tout bouffi d'arrogance  Et qui de mille Auteurs retenus mot

impertinent Jest upon Matrimony is sure to raise it This hath been attended with very pernicious Consequences Many a Country 'Squire upon his setting up for a Man of the Town has gone Home in the

Beds Silent Tables and Solitary Homes have been introduced by your Men of Wit and Pleasure of the Age  As I shall always make it my Business to stem the Torrents of Prejudice and Vice I shall take particular Care to put an honest Father of a Fa∣mily in Countenance and endeavour to remove all the Evils out of that State of Life which is either the most happy or most miserable that a Man can be placed in In order to this let us if you please consider the Wits and wellbred Per∣sons of former Times I have shown in another Paper That  Pliny  who was a Man of the great∣est  Genius as well as of the First Quality of his Age did not think it below nim to be a kind Husband and to treat his Wife as a Friend Com∣panion and Counsellor I shall give the like In∣stance of another who in all Respects was a much greater Man than  Pliny  and hath written a whole Book of Letters to his Wife They are not so full of Turns as those translated out of the former Author who writes very much like a Modern but are full of that beautiful Simplicity which is altogether natural and is the distinguishing Cha∣racter of the best ancient Writers The Author I am speaking of is  Cicero  who in the follow∣ing Passages which I have taken out of his Let∣ters shows that he did not think it inconsistent with the Politeness of his Manners or the Great∣ness of his Wisdom to stand upon Record in his Domestick Character  These Letters were written at a Time when he was banish'd from his Country by a Faction that then prevail'd at  Rome  Cicero  to  Terentia  I Learn from the Letters of my Friends as well as from common Report that you give incredible Proofs of Virtue and Fortitude and that you are indefatigable in all Kinds of good Offices How unhappy a Man am I that a Woman of your Virtue Constancy Honour and good Nature should fall into so great Distresses upon my Account and that my dear  Tulliola  should be so much afflicted for the Sake of a Father with whom she had once so much Rea¦son to be pleas'd How can I mention little  Ci¦cero  whose first Knowledge of Things bega  with the Sense of his own Misery If all thi  had happened by the Decrees of Fate as yo  would kindly perswade me I could have bor  it But alas it is all befallen me by my ow  Indiscretion who thought I was beloved by those that envied me and did not join with them who sought my FriendshipAt pre∣sent since my

than to your self unless when I chance to receive a longer Letter from another which I am indispensibly obliged to answer in every Particular The Truth of it is I have no Subject for a Letter at present and as my Af∣fairs now stand there is nothing more painful to me than Writing As for you and our dear  Tulliola  I cannot write to you without Abun∣dance of Tears for I see both of you miserable whom I always wished to be happy and whom I ought to have made soI must acknow∣ledge you have done every Thing for me with the utmost Fortitude and the utmost Affection  nor indeed is it more than I expected from you though at the same Time it is a great Aggrava∣tion of my ill Fortune that the Afflictions I suf∣fer can be relieved only by those which you un∣dergo for my Sake For honest  Valerius  has written me a Letter which I could not read without weeping very bitterly wherein he gives me an Account of the publick Procession which you have made for me at  Rome  Alas my

Calamity is common it is my Fault that brought it upon us I ought to have died rather than have been driven out of the City I am therefore overwhelmed not only with Grief but with Shame I am ashamed that I did not do my utmost for the best of Wives and the dearest of Children You are ever pre∣sent before my Eyes in your Mourning your Affliction and your Sickness Amidst all which there scarce appears to me the least Glimmer∣ing of HopeHowever as long as you hope I will not despairI will do what you advise me I have returned my Thanks to those Friends whom you mentioned and have let them

Enjoyment of such a SoninLaw and of our dear ChildrenAs for what you write of your coming to me if I desire it I would rather you should be where you are because I know you are my principal Agent at

overcome with Sorrow whilst I am writing to you or reading any Letters that I receive from youIf these Evils are not to be removed I must desire to see you my dearest Life as soon as possible and to die in your Embraces since neither the Gods whom you always religiously worshipped nor the Men whose Good I always promoted have rewarded us according to our DesertsWhat a distressed Wretch am I Should I ask a weak Woman oppressed with Cares and Sickness to come and live with me or shall I not ask her Can I live without you But I find I must If there be any Hopes of my Return help it for∣ward

Senate of  Rome  Every one admires the Orator and the Consul but for my Part I esteem the Husband and the Father His private Character with all the little Weaknesses of Hu∣manity is as amiable as the Figure he makes in publick is awful and majestick But at the same Time that I love to surprise so great an Author in his private Walks and to survey him in his most familiar Lights I think it would be barbarous to form to our selves any Idea of mean Spiritedness from these natural Openings of his Heart and disburthening of his Thoughts to a Wife He has written several other Letters to the same Per∣son but none with so great Passion as these of which I have given the foregoing Extracts  It would be ill Nature not to acquaint the  English  Reader that his Wife was successful in her Solicitations for this great Man and saw her Husband return to the Honours of which he had been depriv'd with all the Pomp and Ac∣clamation that usually attended the greatest Tri∣umph  The TATLER N  o    From  Saturd April  to  Tuesd April    From my own Apartment  April  A Common Civility to an impertinent Fellow often draws upon one a great many unfore∣seen Troubles and if one doth not take particu∣lar Care will be interpreted by him as an Over∣ture of Friendship and Intimacy This I was very sensible of this Morning About Two Hours be∣fore  Day I heard a great Rapping at my Door which continued some Time till my Maid could get her self ready to go down and see what was the Occasion of it She then brought me up Word That there was a Gentleman who seemed very much in Haste and said he must needs speak with me By the Description she gave me of him and by his Voice which I could hear as I lay in my Bed I fancied him to be my old Acquaintance the Upholsterer whom I met the other Day in St  James  's  Park  For which Reason I bid her tell the Gentleman whoever he was That I was indisposed that I could see no Body and that if he had any Thing to say to me I desired he would leave it in Writing My Maid after having delivered her Message told me That the Gentle∣man said he would stay at the next Coffeehouse till I was stirring and bid her be sure to tell me That the  French  were driven from the  Scarp  and that  Douay  was invested He gave her the Name of another Town which I found she had drop∣ped by the Way  As much as I love to be informed of the Suc∣cess of my brave Countrymen I do not care for hearing of a Victory before Day and was there∣fore very much out of Humour at this unseasona∣ble Visit I had no sooner recovered my Temper and was falling asleep but I was immediately startled by a Second Rap and upon my Maid's opening the Door heard the same Voice ask her If her Master was yet up and at the same Time bid her tell me That he was come on Purpose to talk with me about a Piece of HomeNews that every Body in Town will be full of Two Hours hence I ordered my Maid as soon as she came into the Room without hearing her Message to tell the Gentleman That whatever his News is I would rather hear it Two Hours hence than now and that I persisted in my Resolution not to speak with any Body that Morning The  Wench delivered my Answer presently and shut the Door It was impossible for me to compose my self to Sleep after Two such unexpected Alarms for which Reason I put on my Clothes in a very peevish Humour I took several Turns about my Chamber reflecting with a great deal of Anger and Contempt on these Volunteers in Politicks that undergo all the Pain Watchful∣ness and Disquiet of a First Minister without turning it to the Advantage either of themselves or their Country and yet it is surprising to con∣sider how numerous this Species of Men is There is nothing more frequent than to find a Taylor breaking his Rest on the Affairs of  Europe  and to see a Cluster of Porters sitting upon the Ministry Our Streets swarm with Politicians and there is scarce a Shop which is not held by a Statesman As I was musing after this Manner I heard the Upholsterer at the Door delivering a Letter to my Maid and begging her in a very great Hurry to give it to her Master as soon as ever he was awake which I opened and found as follows  Mr  Bickerstaff  I Was to wait upon you about a Week ago to let you know That the honest Gentlemen whom you conversed with upon the Bench at the End of the  Mall  having heard that I had received Five Shillings of you to give you a Hundred Pounds upon the Great  Turk  's being driven out of  Europe  desired me to acquaint you That every one of that Company would be willing to receive Five Shillings to pay a Hun∣dred Pounds on the same Conditions Our last Advices from  Muscovy  making this a fairer Bet than it was a Week ago I do not question but you will accept the Wager  But this is not my present Business If you remember I whispered a Word in your Ear as we were walking up the  Mall  and you see what has happened since If I had seen you this Morning I would have told you in your Ear another Secret I hope you will be recovered of your Indisposition by to Morrow Morning when I will wait on you at the same Hour as I did this my private Circumstances being such that I cannot well appear in this Quarter of the Town after it is Day  I have been so taken up with the late good News from  Holland  and Expectation of further Particulars as well as with other Transactions of which I will tell you more to Morrow Morn∣ing that I have not slept a Wink these Three Nights  I have Reason to believe that  Picardy  will soon follow the Example of  Artois  in case the Enemy continue in their present Resolution of flying away from us I think I told you last Time we were together my Opinion about the  Deulle  The honest Gentlemen upon the Bench bid me tell you they would be glad to see you often among them We shall be there all the warm Hours of the Day during the present Posture of Affairs  This happy Opening of the Campagne will I hope give us a very joyful Summer and I propose to take many a pleasant Walk with you if you will sometimes come into the  Park  for that is the only Place in which I can be free from the Malice of my Enemies Farewel till Three a Clock to Morrow Morning I am  Your most humble Servant  c  P S  The King of  Sweden  is still at  Bender  I should have fretted my self to Death at this Promise of a Second Visit if I had not found in his Letter an Intimation of the good News which I have since heard at large I have however or∣dered my Maid to tie up the Knocker of my Door in such a Manner as she would do if I was really indisposed By which Means I hope to escape breaking my Morning's Rest  Since I have given this Letter to the Publick I shall communicate One or Two more which I have lately received from others of my Correspon∣dents The following is from a  Coquet  who is very angry at my having disposed of her in Mar∣riage to a  BassViol  Mr  Bickerstaff  I Thought you would never have descended from the Censor of  Great Britain  to become a MatchMaker But pray Why so severe upon the  Kit  Had I been a  JewsHarp  that is no∣thing but Tongue you could not have used me worse Of all Things a  BassViol  is my Aver∣sion Had you married me to a  Bagpipe  or a  PassingBell  I should have been better pleased Dear Father  Isaac  either chuse me a better Hus∣band or I will live and die a  Dulcimer  In Hopes of receiving Satisfaction from you I am yours whilst  Isabella Kit  The Pertness which this Fair Lady hath shown in this Letter was one Occasion of my joining her to the  BassViol  which is an Instrument that wants to be quickened by these little Vivacities as the Sprightliness of the  Kit  ought to be check∣ed and curbed by the Gravity of the  BassViol  My next Letter is from  Tom Folio  who it seems takes it amiss that I have published a Character of him so much to his Disadvantage  SIR  I Suppose you meant  Tom Fool  when you cal∣led me  Tom Folio  in a late trifling Paper of yours for I find 'tis your Design to run down all useful and solid Learning The TobaccoPa∣per on which your own Writings are usually printed as well as the Incorrectness of the Press and the Scurvy Letter sufficiently show the Ex∣tent of your Knowledge I question not but you look upon  John Morphew  to be as great a Man as  Elzevir  and  Aldus  to have been such ano∣ther as  Bernard Lintott  If you would give me my Revenge I would only desire of you to let me publish an Account of your Library which I dare say would furnish out an extraordinary Catalogue  Tom Folio  It hath always been my Way to baffle Reproach with Silence tho' I cannot but observe the disin∣genuous Proceedings of this Gentleman who is not content to asperse my Writings but hath wounded through my Sides those eminent and worthy Citizens Mr

Two or Three Days ago in a very pleasing Retirement and amusing my self with the Reading of that ancient and beauti∣ful  Allegory called  The Table of Cebes  I was at last so tired with my Walk that I sat down to rest my self upon a Bench that stood in the Midst of an agreeable Shade The Musick of the Birds that filled all the Trees about me lull'd me asleep before I was aware of it which was fol∣lowed by a Dream that I impute in some Mea∣sure to the foregoing Author who had made an Impression upon my Imagination and put me into his own Way of Thinking  I fancied my self among the  Alpes  and as it is natural in a Dream seemed every Moment to bound from one Summit to another till at last after having made this Airy Progress over the Tops of several Mountains I arrived at the very Centre of those broken Rocks and Precipices I here methought faw a prodigious Circuit of Hills that reached above the Clouds and encom∣passed a large Space of Ground which I had a great Curiosity to look into I thereupon conti∣nued my former Way of travelling through a great Variety of Winter Scenes till I had gained the Top of these white Mountains which seem∣ed another  Alpes  of Snow I looked down from hence into a spacious Plain which was surround∣ed on all Sides by this Mound of Hills and which presented me with the most agreeable Prospect I had ever seen There was a greater Variety of Colours in the Embroidery of the Meadows a more lively Green in the Leaves and Grass a brighter Chrystal in the Streams than what I ever met with in any other Region The Light it self had something more shining and glorious in it than that of which the Day is made in other Places I was wonderfully astonished at the Dis∣covery of such a Paradise amidst the Wildness of those cold hoary Landskips which lay about it but found at length that this happy Region was inhabited by the Goddess of  Liberty  whose Pre∣sence softened the Rigours of the Climate en∣riched  the Barrenness of the Soil and more than supplied the Absence of the Sun The Place was covered with a wonderful Profusion of Flowers that without being disposed into regular Borders and Parterres grew promiscuously and had a greater Beauty in their natural Luxuriancy and Disorder than they could have received from the Checks and Restraints of Art There was a Ri∣ver that arose out of the South Side of the Moun∣tain that by an infinite Number of Turns and Windings seemed to visit every Plant and che∣rish the several Beauties of the Spring with which the Fields abounded After having run to and fro in a wonderful Variety of Meanders as unwilling to leave so charming a Place it at last throws it self into the Hollow of a Moun∣tain from whence it passes under a long Range of Rocks and at length rises in that Part of the  Alpes  where the Inhabitants think it the First Source of the  Rhone  This River after having made its Progress through those free Nations stagnates in a huge Lake at the leaving of them and no sooner enters into the Regions of Slavery but runs through them with an incredible Rapi∣dity and takes its shortest Way to the Sea  I descended into the happy Fields that lay be∣neath me and in the midst of them beheld the Goddess fitting upon a Throne She had no∣thing to enclose her but the Bounds of her own Dominions and nothing over her Head but the Heavens Every Glance of her Eye cast a Track of Light where it fell that revived the Spring and made all Things smile about her My Heart grew chearful at the Sight of her and as she look∣ed upon me I found a certain Confidence grow∣ing in me and such an inward Resolution as I never felt before that Time  On the Left Hand of the Goddess sat the Ge∣nius of a Commonwealth with the Cap of Li∣berty on her Head and in her Hand a Wand  like that with which a  Roman  Citizen used to give his Slaves their Freedom There was something mean and vulgar but at the same Time exceed∣ing bold and daring in her Air her Eyes were full of Fire but had in them such Casts of Fierce∣ness and Cruelty as made her appear to me ra∣ther dreadful than amiable On her Shoulders she wore a Mantle on which there was wrought a great Confusion of Figures As it flew in the Wind I could not discern the particular Design of them but saw Wounds in the Bodies of some and Agonies in the Faces of others and over one Part of it could read in Letters of Blood  The Ides of March  On the Right Hand of the Goddess was the Genius of Monarchy She was cloathed in the whitest Ermin and wore a Crown of the purest Gold upon her Head In her Hand she held a Scepter like that which is born by the  British  Monarchs A Couple of tame Lions lay crouch∣ing at her Feet Her Countenance had in it a very great Majesty without any Mixture of Ter∣ror Her Voice was like the Voice of an Angel filled with so much Sweetness and accompanied with such an Air of Condescention as tempered the Awfulness of her Appearance and equally in∣spired Love and Veneration into the Hearts of all that beheld her  In the Train of the Goddess of  Liberty  were the several Arts and Sciences who all of them flourished underneath her Eye One of them in particular made a greater Figure than any of the rest who held a Thunderbolt in her Hand which had the Power of melting piercing or breaking every Thing that stood in its Way The Name of this Goddess was  Eloquence  There were Two other dependent Goddesses who made a very conspicuous Figure in this bliss∣ful Region The First of them was seated upon an Hill that had every Plant growing out of it  which the Soil was in its own Nature capable of producing The Other was seated in a little Island that was covered with Groves of Spices Olives and OrangeTrees and in a Word with the Products of every Foreign Clime The Name of the First was  Plenty  of the Second  Commerce  The First leaned her Right Arm upon a Plough and under her Left held a huge Horn out of which she poured a whole Autumn of Fruits The Other wore a rostral Crown upon her Head and kept her Eyes fixed upon a Com∣pass  I was wonderfully pleased in ranging through this delightful Place and the more so because it was not incumbered with Fences and Enclo∣sures till at length methoughts I sprung from the Ground and pitched upon the Top of an Hill that presented several Objects to my Sight which I had not before taken Notice of The Winds that pass'd over this flowry Plain and through the Tops of the Trees which were full of Blossoms blew upon me in such a continued Breeze of Sweets that I was wonderfully charm∣ed with my Situation I here saw all the inner Declivities of that great Circuit of Mountains whose Outside was covered with Snow over∣grown with huge Forrests of FirTrees which indeed are very frequently found in other Parts of the  Alpes  These Trees were inhabited by Storks that came thither in great Flights from very distant Quarters of the World Methoughts I was pleased in my Dream to see what became of these Birds when upon leaving the Places to which they make an annual Visit they rise in great Flocks so high till they are out of Sight and for that Reason have been thought by some modern Philosophers to take a Flight to the Moon But my Eyes were soon diverted from this Prospect when I observed Two great Gaps that led thro' this Circuit of Mountains where  Guards and Watches were posted Day and Night Upon Examination I found that there were Two formidable Enemies encamped before each of these Avenues who kept the Place in a perpetual Alarm and watched all Opportunities of inva∣ding it  Tyranny  was at the Head of one of these Armies dressed in an Eastern Habit and grasping in her Hand an Iron Scepter Behind her was  Barbarity  with the Garb and Complexion of an  Aethiopian Ignorance  with a Turbant upon her Head and  Persecution  holding up a bloody Flag embroide∣red with FlowerdeLuces These were followed by  Oppression Poverty Famine Torture  and a dreadful Train of Appearances that made me tremble to behold them Among the Baggage of this Army I could discover Racks Wheels Chains and Gibbets with all the Instruments Art could invent to make humane Nature miserable  Before the other Avenue I saw  Licentiousness  dressed in a Garment not unlike the  Polish  Cas∣sock and leading up an whole Army of Monsters such as  Clamour  with a hoarse Voice and a Hun∣dred Tongues  Confusion  with a mishapen Body and a Thousand Heads  Impudence  with a Fore∣head of Brass and  Rapine  with Hands of Iron The Tumult Noise and Uproar in this Quarter were so very great that they disturbed my Ima∣gination more than is consistent with Sleep and by that Means awaked me  The TATLER N  o    Tertius è Caelo cecidit Cato  Juv Sat  From  Thursd April  to  Saturd April    From my own Apartment  April  IN my younger Years I used many Endeavours to get a Place at Court and indeed conti∣nued my Pursuits till I arrived at my  Grand Cli∣macterick  But at length altogether despairing of Success whether it were for Want of Capacity Friends or due Application I at last resolved to erect a new Office and for my Encouragement to place my self in it For this Reason I took upon me the Title and Dignity of  Censor  of  Great Britain  reserving to my self all such Perquisites Profits and Emoluments as should arise out of the Discharge of the said Office These in Truth have not been inconsiderable for besides those Weekly Contributions which I receive from  John Morphew  and those annual Subscriptions which I propose to my self from the most ele∣gant Part of this great Island I daily live in a very comfortable Affluence of Wine Stale Beer  Hungary  Water Beef Books and MarrowBones which I receive from many welldisposed Citi∣zens not to mention the Forfeitures which ac∣crue to me from the several Offenders that ap∣pear before me on CourtDays  Having now enjoyed this Office for the Space of a Twelvemonth I shall do what all good Of∣ficers ought to do take a Survey of my Beha∣viour and consider carefully whether I have discharged my Duty and acted up to the Chara∣cter with which I am invested For my Dire¦ction  in this Particular I have made a narrow Search into the Nature of the old  Roman Censors  whom I must always regard not only as my Predecessors but as my Patterns in this great Employment and have several Times asked my own Heart with great Impartiality Whether  Cato  will not bear a more venerable Figure among Posterity than  Bickerstaff  I find the Duty of the  Roman Censor  was Two∣fold The first Part of it consisted in making frequent Reviews of the People in casting up their Numbers ranging them under their seve∣ral Tribes disposing them into proper Classes and subdividing them into their respective Cen∣turies  In Compliance with this Part of the Office I have taken many curious Surveys of this great City I have collected into particular Bodies the  Dappers  and the  Smarts  the  Natural  and  Affected Rakes  the  Pretty Fellows  and the  very pretty Fel∣lows  I have likewise drawn out in several di∣stinct Parties your  Pedants  and  Men of Fire  your  Gamesters  and  Politicians  I have separated  Cits  from  Citizens FreeThinkers  from  Philosophers Wits  from  SnuffTakers  and  Duellists  from  Men of Honour  I have likewise made a Calculation of  Esquires  not only considering the several distinct Swarms of them that are settled in the different Parts of this Town but also that more rugged Species that inhabit the Fields and Woods and are often found in Pothouses and upon Hay∣cocks  I shall pass the Soft Sex over in Silence having not yet reduced them into any tolerable Order as likewise the softer Tribe of Lovers which will cost me a great deal of Time before I shall be able to cast them into their several Centuries and Subdivisions  The Second Part of the  Roman Censor  's Office was to look into the Manners of the People and  to check any growing Luxury whether in Diet Dress or Building This Duty likewise I have endeavoured to discharge by those wholesome Precepts which I have given my Countrymen in regard to Beef and Mutton and the severe Censures which I have passed upon Ragouts and Frigacies There is not as I am informed a Pair of Red Heols to be seen within Ten Miles of  London  which I may likewise ascribe with∣out Vanity to the becoming Zeal which I ex∣pressed in that Particular I must own my Suc∣cess with the Petticoat is not so great But as I have not yet done with it I hope I shall in a little Time put an effectual Stop to that grow∣ing Evil As for the Article of Building I in∣tend hereafter to enlarge upon it having lately observed several Warehouses nay private Shops that stand upon  Corinthian  Pillars and whole Rows of Tin Pots showing themselves in order to their Sale through a SashWindow  I have likewise followed the Example of the  Roman  Censors in punishing Offences accord∣ing to the Quality of the Offender It was usual for them to expel a Senator who had been guilty of great Immoralities out of the SenateHouse by omitting his Name when they called over the List of his Brethren In the same Manner to remove effectually several worthless Men who stand possessed of great Honours I have made frequent Draughts of dead Men out of the vi∣cious Part of the Nobility and given them up to the new Society of Upholders with the neces∣sary Orders for their Interrment As the  Roman Censors  used to punish the Knights or Gentlemen of  Rome  by taking away their Horses from them I have seised the Canes of many Crimi∣nals of Figure whom I had just Reason to animadvert upon As for the Offenders among the Common People of  Rome  they were gene∣rally chastised by being thrown out of a higher  Tribe and placed in one which was not so ho∣nourable My Reader cannot but think I have had an Eye to this Punishment when I have de∣graded one Species of Men into Bombs Squibs and Crackers and another into Drums BassViols and Bagpipes not to mention whole Packs of Delinquents whom I have shut up in Kennels and the new Hospital which I am at present erecting for the Reception of those my Countrymen who give me but little Hopes of their Amendment on the Borders of  MoorFields  I shall only observe upon this last Particular That since some late Surveys I have taken of this Island I shall think it necessary to enlarge the Plan of the Buildings which I design in this Quarter  When my great Predecessor  Cato  the Elder stood for the Censorship of  Rome  there were se∣veral other Competitors who offered themselves and to get an Interest among the People gave them great Promises of the mild and gentle Treat∣ment which they would use towards them in that Office  Cato  on the contrary told them he presented himself as a Candidate because he knew the Age was sunk in Immorality and Cor∣ruption and that if they would give him their Votes he would promise them to make use of such a Strictness and Severity of Discipline as should recover them out of it The  Roman  Historians upon this Occasion very much cele∣brate the PublickSpiritedness of that People who chose  Cato  for their Censor notwithstand∣ing his Method of recommending himself I may in some Measure extol my own Country∣men upon the same Account who without any Rrspect to Party or any Application from my self have made such generous Subscriptions for the Censor of  Great Britain  as will give e Mag∣nificence to my old Age and which I esteem more than I would any Post in  Europe  of an Hundred  Times the Value I shall only add That upon looking into my Catalogue of Subscribers which I intend to print Alphabetically in the Front of my Lucubrations I find the Names of the great∣est Beauties and Wits in the whole Island of  Great Britain  which I only mention for the Be∣nefit of any of them who have not yet subscribed it being my Design to close the Subscription in a very short Time  The TATLER N  o    Idem Inficeto est inficetior Rure  Simul Poemata attigit neque idem unquam  Aequè est beatus ac Poema cum scribit  Tam gaudet in se tamque se ipse miratur  Nimirum idem omnes fallimur neque est quisquam  Quem non in aliqua re videre  Soffenum  Possis  Catul de Suffeno  From  Saturd April  to  Tuesd April    Will's Coffeehouse  April  I Yesterday came hither about Two Hours be∣fore the Company generally make their Ap∣pearance with a Design to read over all the NewsPapers but upon my sitting down I was accosted by  Ned Softly  who saw me from a Corner in the other End of the Room where I found he had been writing something Mr  Bicker∣staff  says he I observe by a late Paper of yours that you and I are just of a Humour for you mu  t know of all Impertinencies there is no∣thing which I so much hate as News I never read a  Gazette  in my Life and never trouble  my Head about our Armies whether they win or lose or in what Part of the World they he encamped Without giving me Time to reply he drew a Paper of Verses out of his Pocket telling me That he had something which would entertain me more agreeably and that he would desire my Judgment upon every Line for that we had Time enough before us till the Company came in  Ned Softly  is a very pretty Poet and a great Admirer of easy Lines  Waller  is his Favourite And as that admirable Writer has the best and worst Verses of any among our great  English  Poets  Ned Softly  has got all the bad Ones with∣out Book which he repeats upon Occasion to show his Reading and garnish his Conversation  Ned  is indeed a true  English  Reader incapable of relishing the great and masterly Strokes of this Art but wonderfully pleased with the little  Gothick  Ornaments of Epigrammatical Conceits Turns Points and Quibbles which are so fre∣quent in the most admired of our  English  Poets and practised by those who want Genius and Strength to represent after the Manner of the Ancients Simplicity in its natural Beauty and Perfection  Finding my self unavoidably engaged in such a Conversation I was resolved to turn my Pain into a Pleasure and to divert my self as well as I could with so very odd a Fellow You must understand says  Ned  that the Sonnet I am go ng to read to you was written upon a Lady wi  shewed me some Verses of her own making and is perhaps the best Poet of our Age But you shall hear it Upon which he begun to read as fol∣lows  To  Mira  on her incomparable Poems    When dress'd in Lawrel Wreaths you shine  And tune your soft melodious Notes  You seem a Sister of the Nine  Or  Phoebus  self in Petticoats    I fancy when your Song you sing  Your Song you sing with so much Art  Your Pen was pluck'd from  Cupid  's Wing  For ah it wounds me like his Dart  Why says I this is a little Nosegay of Con∣ceits a very Lump of Salt Every Verse hath something in it that piques and then the Dart in the last Line is certainly as pretty a Sting in the Tail of an Epigram for so I think your Criticks call it as ever entered into the Thought of a Poet Dear Mr  Bickerstaff  says he shaking me by the Hand every Body knows you to be a Judge of these Things and to tell you truly I read over  Roscommon  's Translation of  Horace  's  Art of Poetry  Three several Times before I sat down to write the Sonnet which I have shown you But you shall hear it again and pray ob∣serve every Line of it for not one of them shall pass without your Approbation  When dress'd in Lawrel Wreaths you shine  That is says he when have your Garland on when you are Writing Verses To which I replied I know your Meaning A Metaphor The same said he and went on  And tune your soft melodious Notes  Pray observe the Gliding of that Verse there is scarce a Consonant in it I took Care to make it run upon Liquids Give me your Opinion of  it Truly said I I think it as good as the former I am very glad to hear you say so says he but mind the next  You seem a Sister of the Nine  That is says he you seem a Sister of the Muses for if you look into ancient Authors you will find it was their Opinion that there were Nine of them I remember it very well said I but pray proceed  Or  Phoebus  self in Petticoats  Phoebus  says he was the God of Poetry These little Instances Mr  Bickerstaff  show a Gentleman's Reading Then to take off from the Air of Learning which  Phoebus  and the Muses have given to this first Stanza you may observe how it falls all of a sudden into the Familiar  in Petticoats  Or  Phoebus  self in Petticoats  Let us now says I enter upon the Second Stanza I find the First Line is still a Continua∣tion of the Metaphor  I fancy when your Song you sing  It is very right says he but pray observe the Turn of Words in those Two Lines I was a whole Hour in adjusting of them and have still a Doubt upon me Whether in the Second Line it should be  Your Song you sing  or  You sing your Song  You shall hear them both  I fancy when your Song you sing  Your Song you sing with so much Art  OR  I fancy when your Song you sing  You sing your Song with so much Art  Truly said I the Turn is so natural either Way that you have made me almost giddy with it Dear Sir said he grasping me by the Hand you have a great deal of Patience but pray what do you think of the next Verse  Your Pen was pluck'd from Cupid's Wing  Think says I I think you have made  Cupid  look like a little Goose That was my Meaning says he I think the Ridicule is well enough hit off But we now come to the last which sums up the whole Matter  For Ah it wounds me like his Dart  Pray how do you like that  Ah  Doth it not make a pretty Figure in that Place  Ah  It looks as if I felt the Dart and cried out at being pricked with it  For Ah it wounds me like his Dart  My Friend  Dick Easy  continued he assured me he would rather have written that  Ah  than to have been the Author of the  Aeneid  He in∣deed objected that I made  Mira  's Pen like a Quill in one of the Lines and like a Dart in the other But as to thatOh as to that says I it is but supposing  Cupid  to be like a Porcupine and his Quills and Darts will be the same Thing He was going to embrace me for the Hint but half a Dozen Criticks coming into the Room whose Faces he did not like he conveyed the Sonnet into his Pocket and whispered me in the Ear he would show it me again as soon as his Man had written it over fair  The TATLER N  o    Qui sibi promittit Cives Urbem sibi Curae  Imperium fore Italiam Delubra Deorum  Quo Patre sit natus num ignot â Matre inhonestus  Omnes Mortales curare quaerere cogit  Hor  From  Tuesd April  to  Thursd April    From my own Apartment  April  I HAVE lately been looking over the many Pacquets of Letters which I have received from all Quarters of  Great Britain  as well as from Foreign Countries since my entring upon the Office of  Censor  and indeed am very much sur∣prized to see so great a Number of them and pleased to think that I have so far encreased the Revenue of the  PostOffice  As this Collection will grow daily I have digested it into several Bundles and made proper Endorsements on each particular Letter it being my Design when I lay down the Work that I am now engaged in to erect a Paper Office and give it to the Publick  I could not but make several Observations upon reading over the Letters of my Correspondents As first of all on the different Tasts that reign in the different Parts of this City I find by the Approbations which are given me That I am seldom famous on the same Days on both Sides of  TempleBar  and that when I am in the great∣est Repute within the Liberties I dwindle at the Court End of the Town Sometimes I sink in both these Places at the same Time but for my Comfort my Name hath then been up in the Districts of  Wapping  and  Rotherhithe  Some of  my Correspondents desire me to be always se∣rious and others to be always merry Some of them entreat me to go to Bed and fall into a Dream and like me better when I am asleep than when I am awake Others advise me to fit all Night upon the Stars and be more fre∣quent in my Astrological Observations for that a Vision is not properly a Lucubration Some of my Readers thank me for filling my Paper with the Flowers of Antiquity others desire News from  Flanders  Some approve my Criticisms on the Dead and others my Censures on the Living For this Reason I once resolved in the new Edi∣tion of my Works to range my several Pa∣pers under distinct Heads according as their principal Design was to benefit and instruct the different Capacities of my Readers and to follow the Example of some very great Au∣thors by writing at the Head of each Discourse  Ad Aulam Ad Academiam Ad Populum Ad Clerum  There is no Particular in which my Correspon∣dents of all Ages Conditions Sexes and Com∣plexions universally agree except only in their Thirst after Scandal It is impossible to conceive how many have recommended their Neighbours to me upon this Account or how unmercifully I have been abused by several unknown Hands for not publishing the secret Histories of Cuckol∣dom that I have received from almost every Street in Town  It would indeed be very dangerous for me to read over the many Praises and Eulogiums which come Post to me from all the Corners of the Nation were they not mixed with many Checks Reprimands Scurrilities and Re∣proaches which several of my goodnatured Countrymen cannot forbear sending me though it often costs them Twopence or a Groat before they can convey them to my Hands So that  sometimes when I am put into the best Humour in the World after having read a Panegyrick upon my Performance and looked upon my self as a Benefactor to the  British  Nation the next Letter perhaps I open begins with  You old Do∣ting ScoundrelAre not you a sad DogSirrah you deserve to have your Nose slit  And the like ingenious Conceits These little Mortifications are necessary to surpass that Pride and Vanity which naturally arise in the Mind of a received Author and enable me to bear the Reputation which my courteous Readers bestow upon me without becoming a Coxcomb by it It was for the same Reason that when a  Roman  Gene∣ral entered the City in the Pomp of a Triumph the Commonwealth allowed of several little Drawbacks to his Reputation by conniving at such of the Rabble as repeated Libels and Lam∣poons upon him within his Hearing and by that Means engaged his Thoughts upon his Weakness and Imperfections as well as on the Merits that advanced him to so great Honours The Con∣queror however was not the less esteemed for being a Man in some Particulars because he ap∣peared as a God in others  There is another Circumstance in which my Countrymen have dealt very perversely with me and that is in Searching not only into my own Life but also into the Lives of my Ancestors If there has been a Blot in my Family for these Ten Generations it hath been discovered by some or other of my Correspondents In short I find the ancient Family of the  Bickerstaffs  has suffered very much through the Malice and Prejudice of my Enemies Some of them twit me in the Teeth with the Conduct of my Aunt  Margery  Nay there are some who have been so disinge∣nuous as to throw  Maud  the MilkMaid into my Dish notwithstanding I my self was the first who discovered that Alliance I reap however  many Benefits from the Malice of these my Ene∣mies as they let me see my own Faults and give me a View of my self in the worst Light as they hinder me from being blown up by Flattery and SelfConceit as they make me keep a watchful Eye over my own Actions and at the same Time make me cautious how I talk of others and par∣ticularly of my Friends and Relations or value my self upon the Antiquity of my Family  But the most formidable Part of my Correspon∣dents are those whose Letters are filled with Threats and Menaces I have been treated so often after this Manner that not thinking it suf∣ficient to fence well in which I am now arrived at the utmost Perfection and carry Pistols about me which I have always tuck'd within my Gir∣dle I several Months since made my Will set∣tled my Estate and took Leave of my Friends looking upon my self as no better than a dead Man Nay I went so far as to write a long Let∣ter to the most intimate Acquaintance I have in the World under the Character of a departed Person giving him an Account of what brought me to that untimely End and of the Fortitude with which I met it This Letter being too long for the present Paper I intend to print it by it self very suddenly and at the same Time I must confess I took my Hint of it from the Be∣haviour of an old Soldier in the Civil Wars who was Corporal of a Company in a Regiment of Foot about the same Time that I my self was a Cadet in the King's Army  This Gentleman was taken by the Enemy and the Two Parties were upon such Terms at that Time that we did not treat each other as Prisoners of War but as Traitors and Rebels The poor Corporal being condemned to die wrote a Letter to his Wife when under Sentence of Exe∣cution He writ on the  Thursday  and was to be executed on the  Friday  But considering that the  Letter would not come to his Wife's Hands till  Saturday  the Day after Execution and being at that Time more scrupulous than ordinary in speaking exact Truth he formed his Letter ra∣ther according to the Posture of his Affairs when she should read it than as they stood when he sent it Though it must be confessed there is a certain Perplexity in the Style of it which the Reader will easily pardon considering his Cir∣cumstances  Dear Wife  HOping you are in good Health as I am at this present Writing This is to let you know that Yesterday between the Hours of Eleven and Twelve I was hanged drawn and quar∣tered I died very penitently and every Body thought my Case very hard Remember me kindly to my poor Fatherless Children  Yours till Death  W B  It so happened that this honest Fellow was relieved by a Party of his Friends and had the Satisfaction to see all the Rebels hanged who had been his Enemies I must not omit a Circum∣stance which exposed him to Raillery his whole Life after Before the Arrival of the next Post that would have set all Things clear his Wife was married to a Second Husband who lived in the peaceable Possession of her and the Cor∣poral who was a Man of plain Understanding did not care to stir in the Matter as knowing that she had the News of his Death under his own Hand which she might have produced upon Occasion  The TATLER N  o    From  Thursd April  to  Saturd April    From my own Apartment  April  IT has always been my Endeavour to distinguish between Realities and Appearances and to se∣parate true Merit from the Pretence to it As it shall ever be my Study to make Discoveries of this Nature in Humane Life and to settle the proper Distinctions between the Virtues and Per∣fections of Mankind and those false Colours and Resemblances of them that shine alike in the Eyes of the Vulgar so I shall be more particu∣larly careful to search into the various Merits and Pretences of the learned World This is the more necessary because there seems to be a ge∣neral Combination among the Pedants to extol one another's Labours and cry up one another's Parts while Men of Sense either through that Modesty which is natural to them or the Scorn they have for such trifling Commendations en∣joy their Stock of Knowledge like a hidden Trea∣sure with Satisfaction and Silence Pedantry in∣deed in Learning is like Hypocrisy in Religion a Form of Knowledge without the Power of it that attracts the Eyes of the Common People breaks out in Noise and Show and finds its Re∣ward not from any inward Pleasure that attends it but from the Praises and Approbations which it receives from Men  Of this shallow Species there is not a more im∣portunate empty and conceited Animal than that which is generally known by the Name of a Critick This in the common Acceptation of the Word is one that without entering into  the Sense and Soul of an Author has a few ge∣neral Rules which like mechanical Instru∣ments he applies to the Works of every Writer and as they quadrate with them pronounces the Author perfect or defective He is Master of a certain Set of Words as Unity Style Fire Flegm Easy Natural Turn Sentiment and the like which he varies compounds divides and throws together in every Part of his Discourse without any Thought or Meaning The Marks you may know him by are an elevated Eye and dogmatical Brow a positive Voice and a Contempt for every Thing that comes out whe∣ther he has read it or not He dwells altogether in Generals He praises or dispraises in the Lump He shakes his Head very frequently at the Pedantry of Universities and bursts into Laughter when you mention an Author that is not known at  Will  's He hath formed his Judg∣ment upon  Homer Horace  and  Virgil  not from their own Works but from those of  Rapin  and  Bossu  He knows his own Strength so well that he never dares praise any Thing in which he has not a  French  Author for his Voucher  With these extraordinary Talents and Accom∣plishments Sir  Timothy Tittle  puts Men in Vogue or condemns them to Obscurity and sits as Judge of Life and Death upon every Author that ap∣pears in Publick It is impossible to represent the Pangs Agonies and Convulsions which Sir  Ti∣mothy  expresses in every Feature of his Face and Muscle of his Body upon the reading of a bad Poet  About a Week ago I was engaged at a Friend's of mine in an agreeable Conversation with his Wife and Daughters when in the Height of our Mirth Sir  Timothy  who makes Love to my Friend's eldest Daughter came in amongst us puffing and blowing as if he had been very much out of Breath He immediately called for a  Chair and desired Leave to sit down without any further Ceremony I ask'd him Where he had been Whether he was out of Order He only replied That he was quite spent and fell a cursing in Soliloquy I could hear him cry  A Wicked RogueAn execrable WretchWat there ever such a Monster  The young Ladies upon this began to be affrighted and asked Whether any one had hurt him He answered nothing but still talked to himself  To lay the first Scene  says he  in St  James  's  Park  and the last in  Northamptonshire Is that all says I Then I suppose you have been at the Rehearsal of a Play this Morning  Been  says he I have been at  Northampton  in the  Park  in a Lady's Bed Chamber in a DiningRoom every where the Rogue has led me such a DanceTho' I could scarce forbear laughing at his Discourse I told him I was glad it was no worse and that he was only Metaphorically weary In short Sir says he the Author has not observed a single Unity in his whole Play the Scene shifts in every Dialogue the Villain has hurried me up and down at such a Rate that I am tired off my Legs I could not but observe with some Plea∣sure that the young Lady whom he made Love to conceived a very just Aversion towards him upon seeing him so very passionate in Trifles And as she had that natural Sense which makes her a better Judge than a Thousand Criticks she began to rally him upon this foolish Humour For my Part says she I never knew a Play take that was written up to your Rules as you call them How Madam says he Is that your Opi∣nion I am sure you have a better Tast It is a pretty Kind of Magick says she the Poets have to transport an Audience from Place to Place without the Help of a Coach and Horses I could travel round the World at such a Rate 'Tis such an Entertainment as an Enchantress finds  when she fancies her self in a Wood or upon a Mountain at a Feast or a Solemnity though at the same Time she has never stirred out of her Cottage Your Simile Madam says Sir  Timo∣thy  is by no Means just Pray says she let my Similies pass without a Criticism I must confess continued she for I found she was re∣solved to exasperate him I laughed very heartily at the last new Comedy which you found so much Fault with But Madam says he you ought not to have laughed and I defy any one to show me a single Rule that you could laugh by Ought not to laugh says she Pray who should hinder me Madam says he there are such People in the World as  Rapin Dacier  and several others that ought to have spoiled your Mirth I have heard says the young Lady That your great Criticks are always very bad Poets I fancy there is as much Difference be∣tween the Works of one and the other as there is between the Carriage of a Dancing Master and a Gentleman I must confess continued she I would not be troubled with so fine a Judg∣ment as yours is for I find you feel more Vexa∣tion in a bad Comedy than I do in a deep Tra∣gedy Madam says Sir  Timothy  That is not my Fault they should learn the Art of Writing For my Part says the young Lady I should think the greatest Art in your Writers of Come∣dies is to please To please says Sir  Timothy  and immediately fell a laughing Truly says she that is my Opinion Upon this he com∣posed his Countenance looked upon his Watch and took his Leave  I hear that Sir  Timothy  has not been at my Friend's House since this notable Conference to the great Satisfaction of the young Lady who by this Means has got rid of a very impertinent Fop  I must confess I could not but observe with a great deal of Surprize how this Gentleman by his ill Nature Folly and Affectation hath made himself capable of suffering so many ima∣ginary Pains and looking with such a sense∣less Severity upon the common Diversions of Life  The TATLER N  o    Dicenda Tacenda Loquutus  Hor  From  Saturd April  to  Tuesd May    White's

to my View some new Sect of Impertinents that had before escaped Notice This Afternoon as I was talking with fine Mrs  Sprightly  's Por∣ter and desiring Admittance upon an extraordi∣nary Occasion it was my Fate to be spy'd by  Tom Modely  riding by in his Chariot He did me the Honour to stop and asked What I did there of a  Monday  I answered That I had Business of Importance which I wanted to communicate to the Lady of the House  Tom  is one of those Fools who look upon Knowledge of the Fashion to be the only Liberal Science and was so rough as to tell me That a wellbred Man would as soon call upon a Lady who keeps a Day at Mid∣night as on any Day but that on which she pro∣fesses being at Home There are Rules and De∣corums which are never to be transgressed by  those who understand the World and he who offends in that Kind ought not to take it ill if he is turned away even when he sees the Person look out at her Window whom he enquires for Nay said he my Lady  Dimple  is so positive in this Rule that she takes it for a Piece of good Breeding and Distinction to deny her self with her own Mouth Mrs  Comma  the great Scho∣lar insists upon it and I my self have heard her assert That a Lord's Porter or a Lady's Woman cannot be said to lie in that Case because they act by Instruction and their Words are no more their own than those of a Puppet  He was going on with this Ribaldry when on a sudden he looked on his Watch and said ho had Twenty Visits to make and drove away without further Ceremony I was then at Lei∣sure to reflect upon the Tastless Manner of Life which a Set of idle Fellows lead in this Town and spend Youth it self with less Spirit than other Men do their old Age These Expletives in Humane Society tho' they are in themselves wholly insignificant become of some Considera∣tion when they are mixed with others I am very much at a Loss how to define or under what Character Distinction or Denomination to place them except you give me Leave to call them the Order of the  Insipids  This Order is in its Extent like that of the Jesuits and you see of them in every Way of Life and in every Profession  Tom Modely  has long appeared to me at the Head of this Species By being habi∣tually in the best Company he knows perfectly well when a Coat is well cut or a Periwig well mounted As soon as you enter the Place where he is he tells the next Man to him who is your Taylor and judges of you more from the Choice of your Periwigmaker than of your Friend His Business in this World was to be well dressed and the greatest Circumstance that is to be recor∣ded  in his Annals is That he wears Twenty Shirts a Week Thus without ever speaking Reason among the Men or Passion among the Women he is every where well received and without any one Man's Esteem he has every Man's In∣dulgence  This Order has produced great Numbers of tolerable Copiers in Painting good Rhimers in Poetry and harmless Projectors in Politicks You may see them at first Sight grow acquainted by Sympathy insomuch that one who had not stu∣died Nature and did not know the true Cause of their sudden Familiarities would think that they had some secret Intimation of each other like the Free Masons The other Day at  Will  's I heard  Modely  and a Critick of the same Or∣der show their equal Talents with great Delight The Learned Insipid was commending  Racine  's Turns the Genteel Insipid  Devillier  's Curls  These Creatures when they are not forced into any particular Employment for want of Idea's in their own Imaginations are the constant Plague of all they meet with by Enquiries for News and Scandal which makes them the He∣roes of Visiting Days where they help the De∣sign of the Meeting which is to pass away that odious Thing called Time in Discourses too trivial to raise any Reflections which may put wellbred Persons to the Trouble of Think∣ing  From my own Apartment  May  I was looking out of my ParlourWindow this Morning and receiving the Honours which  Mar∣gery  the Milkmaid to our Lane was doing me by dancing before my Door with the Plate of half her Customers on her Head when Mr  Clay∣ton  the Author of  Arsinoe  made me a Visit and desired me to insert the following Advertisement in my ensuing Paper  The Pastoral Masque compos'd by Mr  Clayton  Author of  Arsinoe  will be performed on  Wednes∣day  the d Instant in the great Room at  YorkBuildings  Tickets are to be had at  White  's Cho∣colatehouse  St James  's Coffeehouse in  St James  's∣  street  and  Young Man  's Coffeehouse  Note  The Tickets delivered out for the th of  April  will be taken then  When I granted his Request I made one to him which was That the Performers should put their Instruments in Tune before the Audience came in for that I thought the Resentment of the Eastern Prince who according to the old Story took  Tuning  for  Playing  to be very just and natural He was so civil as not only to pro∣mise that Favour but also to assure me that he would order the Heels of the Performers to be muffled in Cotton that the Artists in so polite an Age as ours may not intermix with their Harmony a Custom which so nearly resembles the Stamping Dances of the  WestIndians  or  Hot∣tentots  ADVERTISEMENTS  A  BassViol  of Mr  Bickerstaff  's Acquaintance whose Mind and Fortune do not very exactly agree proposes to set himself to Sale by Way of Lottery Ten Thousand Pounds is the Sum to be raised at Threepence a Ticket in Consideration that there are more Women who are willing to be married than that can spare a greater Sum He has al∣ready made over his Person to Trustees for the said Money to be forthcoming and ready to take to Wife the fortunate Woman that wins him  N B  Tickets are given out by Mr  Charles Lil∣lie  and Mr  John Morphew  Each Adventurer must be a Virgin and subscribe her Name to her Ticket  Whereas the several ChurchWardens of most of the Parishes within the Bills of Mortality have in  an earnest Manner applied themselves by Way of Petition and have also made a Presentment of the vain and loose Deportment during Divine Service of Persons of too great Figure in all their said Parishes for their Reproof And whereas it is therein set forth That by Salutations given each other Hints Shrugs Ogles Playing of Fans and feeling with Canes at their Mouths and other wan∣ton Gesticulations their whole Congregation appears rather a Theatrical Audience than an House of Devotion It is hereby ordered That all Canes Cravats BosomLaces Muffs Fans SnuffBoxes and all other Instruments made use of to give Per∣sons unbecoming Airs shall be immediately forfeited and sold and of the Sum arising from the Sale thereof a Ninth Part shall be paid to the Poor and the rest to the Overseers  The TATLER N  o    Seguius irritant Animos dimissa per Aures  Quam quae sunt Oculis submisso fidelibus  Hor  From  Tuesday May  to  Thursday May    From my own Apartment  May  HAving received Notice That the famou  Actor Mr  Betterton  was to be interred thi  Evening in the Cloysters near  WestminsterAbbey  I was resolved to walk thither and see the la  Office done to a Man whom I had always ver  much admired and from whose Action I had r  ¦ceived more strong Impressions of what is gre  and noble in Humane Nature than from the A  ¦guments of the most solid Philosophers or the D  ¦scriptions of the most charming Poets I had ev  read As the rude and untaught Multitude are no Way wrought upon more effectually than by seeing publick Punishments and Executions so Men of Letters and Education feel their Huma∣nity most forcibly exercised when they attend the Obsequies of Men who had arrived at any Perfection in Liberal Accomplishments Thea∣trical Action is to be esteemed as such except it be objected that we cannot call that an Art which cannot be attained by Art Voice Sta∣ture Motion and other Gifts must be very bountifully bestowed by Nature or Labour and Industry will but push the unhappy Endeavourer in that Way the further off his Wishes  Such an Actor as Mr  Betterton  ought to be re∣corded with the same Respect as  Roscius  among the  Romans  The greatest Orator has thought fit to quote his Judgment and celebrate his Life  Roscius  was the Example to all that would form themselves into proper and winning Behaviour His Action was so well adapted to the Sentiments he expressed that the Youth of  Rome  thought they wanted only to be virtuous to be as graceful in their Appearance as  Roscius  The Imagination took a lovely Impression of what was great and good and they who never thought of setting up for the Arts of Imitation became themselves imitable Characters  There is no Humane Inventions so aptly cal∣culated for the forming a Freeborn People as that of a Theatre  Tully  reports That the ce∣lebrated Player of whom I am speaking used fre∣quently to say  The Perfection of an Actor is only to become what he is doing  Young Men who are too unattentive to receive Lectures are irre∣sistibly taken with Performances Hence it is that I extremely lament the little Relish the Gentry of this Nation have at present for the just and noble Representations in some of our Tragedies The Opera's which are of late in∣troduced  can leave no Trace behind them that can be of Service beyond the present Moment To sing and to dance are Accomplishments very few have any Thoughts of practising but to speak justly and move gracefully is what every Man thinks he does perform or wishes he did  I have hardly a Notion that any Performer of Antiquity could surpass the Action of Mr  Better∣ton  in any of the Occasions in which he has appear'd on our Stage The wonderful Agony which he ap∣peared in when he examined the Circumstance of the Handkerchief in  Othello  the Mixture of Love that intruded upon his Mind upon the in∣nocent Answers  Desdemona  makes betrayed in his Gesture such a Variety and Vicissitude of Pas∣sions as would admonish a Man to be afraid of his own Heart and perfectly convince him that it is to stab it to admit that worst of Daggers Jea∣lousy Whoever reads in his Closet this admira∣ble Scene will find that he cannot except he has as warm an Imagination as  Shakespear  him∣self find any but dry incoherent and broken Sentences But a Reader that has seen  Bettterton  act it observes there could not be a Word added that longer Speech had been unnatu∣ral nay impossible in  Othello  's Circumstances The charming Passage in the same Tragedy where he tells the Manner of winning the Af∣fection of his Mistress was urged with so moving and graceful an Energy that while I walked in the Cloysters I thought of him with the same Concern as if I waited for the Remains of a Person who had in real Life done all that I had seen him represent The Gloom of the Place and faint Lights before the Ceremony aypeared contributed to the melancholy Disposition I wa  in and I began to be extremely afflicted tha  Brutus  and  Cassius  had any Difference that  Hot¦spur  's Gallantry was so unfortunate and that th  Mirth and good Humour of  Falstaff  could no  exempt him from the Grave Nay this Occa∣sion in me who look upon the Distinctions a∣mongst Men to be meerly Scenical raised Re∣flections upon the Emptiness of all Humane Per∣fection and Greatness in general and I could not but regret that the Sacred Heads which lie bu∣ried in the Neighbourhood of this little Portion of Earth in which my poor old Friend is de∣posited are returned to Dust as well as he and that there is no Difference in the Grave between the Imaginary and the Real Monarch This made me say of Humane Life it self with  Mack∣beth  To Morrow to Morrow and to Morrow  Creeps in a stealing Pace from Day to Day  To the last Moment of recorded Time  And all our Yesterdays have lighted Fools  To their eternal Night Out out short Candle  Life's but a walking Shadow a poor Player  That struts and frets his Hour upon the Stage  And then is heard no more  The Mention I have here made of Mr  Better∣ton  for whom I had as long as I have known any Thing a very great Esteem and Gratitude for the Pleasure he gave me can do him no Good but it may possibly be of Service to the unhappy Woman he has left behind him to have it known that this great Tragedian was never in a Scene half so moving as the Circumstances of his Af∣fairs created at his Departure His Wife after the Cohabitation of Forty Years in the strictest Amity has long pined away with a Sense of his Decay as well in his Person as his little Fortune and in Proportion to that she has herself de∣cayed both in her Health and Reason Her Husband's Death added to her Age and Infirmi∣ties would certainly have determined her Life but that the Greatness of her Distress has been her Relief by a present Depravation of her  Senses This Absence of Reason is her best De∣fence against Age Sorrow Poverty and Sick∣ness I dwell upon this Account so distinctly in Obedience to a certain great Spirit who hides her Name and has by Letter applied to me to re∣commend to her some Object of Compassion from whom she may be concealed  This I think is a proper Occasion for exerting such heroick Generosity and as there is an inge∣nuous Shame in those who have known better Fortune to be reduced to receive Obligations as well as a becoming Pain in the truly Generous to receive Thanks in this Case both those Deli∣cacies are preserved for the Person obliged is as incapable of knowing her Benefactress as her Benefactress is unwilling to be known by her  ADVERTISEMENT  Whereas it has been signified to the  Censor  That under the Pretence that he has encouraged the  Mo∣ving Picture  and particularly admired the  Walk∣ing Statue  some Persons within the Liberties of  Westminster  have vended Walking Pictures inso∣much that the said Pictures have within few Days after Sales by Auction returned to the Habitation of their first Proprietors that Matter has been narrowly locked into and Orders are given to  Pacolet  to take Notice of all who are concerned in such Frauds with Directions to draw their Pictures that they may be hanged  in Effigie in Terrorem  of all Auctions for the future  The TATLER N  o    From  Thursday May  to  Saturday May    From my own Apartment  May  NEver was Man so much teazed or suffered half the Uneasiness as I have done this Evening between a Couple of Fellows with whom I was unfortunately engaged to sup where there were also several others in Company One of them is the most invincibly impudent and the other as incorrigibly absurd Upon hearing my Name the Man of Audacity as he calls himself began to assume an aukward Way of Reserve by Way of Ridicule upon me as a Censor and said He must have a Care of his Behaviour for there would Notes be writ upon all that should pass The Man of Freedom and Ease for such the other thinks himself asked me Whether my Sister  Jenny  was breeding or not After they had done with me they were impertinent to a very smart but wellbred Man who stood his Ground very well and let the Company see they ought but could not be out of Countenance I look upon such a Defence as a real good Action for while he received their Fire there was a mo∣dest and worthy young Gentleman sat secure by him and a Lady of the Family at the same Time guarded against the nauseous Familiarity  f the one and the more painful Mirth of the  ther This Conversation where there were Thousand Things said not worth repeating  ade me consider with my self How 'tis that  en of these disagreeable Characters often go  eat Lengths in the World and seldom fail of  tstripping Men of Merit nay succeed so  well that with a Load of Imperfections on their Heads they go on in Opposition to general Dis∣esteem while they who are every Way their Superiors languish away their Days tho' posses∣sed of the Approbation and Goodwill of all who know them  If we would examine into the Secret Springs of Action in the Impudent and the Absurd we shall find tho' they bear a great Resemblance in their Behaviour that they move upon very diffe∣rent Principles The Impudent are pressing tho' they know they are disagreeable the Absurd are importunate because they think they are ac∣ceptable Impudence is a Vice and Absurdity a Folly Sir  Francis Bacon  talks very agreeably upon the Subject of Impudence He takes No∣tice That the Orator being asked What was the First Second and Third Requisite to make a fine Speaker Still answered  Action  This said he is the very outward Form of Speaking and yet it is what with the Generality has more Force than the most consummate Abilities Im∣pudence is to the rest to Mankind of the same Use which Action is to Orators  The Truth is the Gross of Men are governed more by Appearances than Realities and the Im∣pudent Man in his Air and Behaviour undertakes for himself that he has Ability and Merit while the Modest or Diffident gives himself up as one who is possessed of neither For this Reason Men of Front carry Things before 'em with little Opposition and make so skilful an Use of their Talent that they can grow out of Humour like Men of Consequence and be sowr and make their Dissatisfaction do them the same Service as Desert This Way of Thinking has often furni∣shed me with an Apology for great Men who confer Favours on the Impudent In carrying on the Government of Mankind they are not to consider what Men they themselves approve in  their Closets and private Conversations but what Men will extend themselves furthest and more generally pass upon the World for such as their Patrons want in such and such Statious and con∣sequently take so much Work off the Hands of those who employ them  Far be it that I should attempt to lessen the Acceptance which Men of this Character meet with in the World but I humbly propose only that they who have Merit of a different Kind would accomplish themselves in some Degree with this Quality of which I am now treating Nay I allow these Gentlemen to press as for∣ward as they please in the Advancement of their Interests and Fortunes but not to intrude upon others in Conversation also Let them do what they can with the Rich and the Great as far as they are suffered but let them not interrupt the Easy and Agreeable They may be useful as Ser∣vants in Ambition but never as Associates in Pleasure However as I would still drive at something instructive in every Lucubration I must recommend it to all Men who feel in them∣selves an Impulse towards attempting laudable Actions to acquire such a Degree of Assurance as never to lose the Possession of themselves in publick or private so far as to be incapable of acting with a due Decorum on any Occasion they are call'd to It is a mean Want of Fortitude in a good Man not to be able to do a virtuous Action with as much Confidence as an impudent Fel∣low does an ill One There is no Way of mend∣ing such false Modesty but by laying it down for a Rule That there is nothing shameful but what is criminal  The Jesuits an Order whose Institution is per∣fectly calculated for making a Progress in the World take Care to accomplish their Disciples for it by breaking them of all impertinent Bash∣fulness and accustoming them to a ready Per∣formance  of all indifferent Things I remember in my Travels when I was once at a publick Exer∣cise in one of their Schools a young Man made a most admirable Speech with all the Beauty of Action Cadence of Voice and Force of Argument imaginable in Defence of the Love of Glory We were all enamoured with the Grace of the Youth as he came down from the Desk where he spoke to present a Copy of his Speech to the Head of the Society The Principal received it in a very obliging Manner and bid him go to the MarketPlace and fetch a Joint of Meat for he should dine with him He bowed and in a Trice the Orator returned full of the Sense of Glory in this Obedience and with the best Shoulder of Mutton in the Market  This Treatment capacitates them for every Scene of Life I therefore recommend it to the Consideration of all who have the Instruction of Youth Which of the Two is the more inexcu∣sable he who does every Thing by the meer Force of his Impudence or who performs no∣thing through the Oppression of his Modesty In a Word it is a Weakness not to be able to at∣tempt what a Man thinks he ought and there is no Modesty but in SelfDenial  P S  Upon my coming Home I received the following Petition and Letter  The humble Petition of  Sarah Lately  Sheweth  THat your Petitioner has been one of those Ladies who has had fine Things con∣stantly spoken to her in general Terms and lived during her most blooming Years in daily Expectation of Declarations of Marriage but never had one made to her  That she is now in her Grand Climacterick which

Discretion Only if you canallow the Tickets at above Five Farthings a∣piece Pray accept of one Ticket for your Trouble and I wish you may be the fortunate Man that wins  Your very humble Servant till

Prize instead of being one her self I do readily grant her Demand but as for the Proposal of Mrs  Isabella Kit  I cannot project a Lottery for her 'till I have Security she will surrender her self to the Winner  The TATLER N  o    O Rus Quando ego te aspiciam quandoqui licebit  Nunc veterum Libris nunc Somno inertibus Horis  Ducere sollicitae Jucunda Oblivia Vitae  Hor  From  Saturd May  to  Tuesd May    From my own Apartment  May  THE Summer Season now approaching se∣veral of our Family have invited me to pass away a Month or Two in the Country and in∣deed nothing could be more agreeable to me than such a Recess did I not consider that I am by Two Quarts a worse Companion than when I was last among my Relations And I am admo∣nished by some of our Club who have lately vi∣sited  Staffordshire  that they drink at a greater Rate than they did at that Time As every Soil does not produce every Fruit or Tree so every Vice is not the Growth of every Kind of Life and I have ever since I could think been asto∣nished that Drinking should be the Vice of the Country If it were possible to add to all our Senses as we do to that of Sight by Perspe∣ctives we should methinks more particularly labour to improve them in the midst of the Va∣riety of beauteous Objects which Nature has pro∣duced to entertain us in the Country and do we in that Place destroy the Use of what Organs we have As for my Part I cannot but lament the Destruction that has been made of the Wild Beasts of the Field when I see large Tracts of Earth possessed by Men who take no Advantage  of their being rational but lead meer Animal Lives making it their whole Endeavour to kill in themselves all they have above Beasts to wit the Use of Reason and Tast of Society It is frequently boasted in the Writings of Orators and Poets That it is to Eloquence and Poesy we owe that we are drawn out of Woods and Solitudes into Towns and Cities and from a wild and savage Being become acquainted with the Laws of Humanity and Civility If we are obliged to these Arts for so great Service I could wish they were employed to give us a Second Turn that as they have brought us to dwell in Society a Blessing which no other Creatures know so they would perswade us now they have settled us to lay out all our Thoughts in surpassing each other in those Faculties in which only we excel other Creatures But it is at pre∣sent so far otherwise that the Contention seems to be who shall be most eminent in Performan∣ces wherein Beasts enjoy greater Abilities than we have I'll undertake were the Butler and Swineherd at any true Esquire's in  Great Britain  to keep and compare Accounts of what Wash is drank up in so many Hours in the Parlour and the Pigsty it would appear the Gentleman of the House gives much more to his Friends than his Hogs  This with many other Evils arises from the Error in Men's Judgments and not making true Distinctions between Persons and Things It is usually thought That a few Sheets of Parch∣ment made before a Male and Female of weal∣thy Houses come together give the Heirs and Descendants of that Marriage Possession of Lands and Tenements but the Truth is there is no Man who can be said to be Proprietor of an Estate but he who knows how to enjoy it Nay it shall never be allowed that the Land is not a Waste when the Master is uncultivated There∣fore  to avoid Confusion it is to be noted that a Peasant with a great Estate is but an Incum∣bent and that he must be a Gentleman to be a Landlord A Landlord enjoys what he has with his Heart an Incumbent with his Stomach Gluttony Drunkenness and Riot are the Enter∣tainments of an Incumbent Benevolence Ci∣vility Social and Humane Virtues the Accom∣plishments of a Landlord Who that has any Passion for his native Country does not think it worse than conquered when so large Diversions of it are in the Hands of Salvages that know no Use of Property but to be Tyrants or Liber∣ty but to be unmannerly A Gentleman in a Country Life enjoys Paradise with a Temper fit for it a Clown is cursed in it with all the cut∣ting and unruly Passions Man could be torment∣ed with when he was expelled from it  There is no Character more deservedly esteem∣ed than that of a Country Gentleman who un∣derstands the Station in which Heaven and Na∣ture have plac'd him He is Father to his Te∣nants and Patron to his Neighbours and is more superior to those of lower Fortune by his Bene∣volence than his Possessions He justly divides his Time between Solitude and Company so as to use the one for the other His Life is spent in the good Offices of an Advocate a Referee a Companion a Mediator and a Friend His Counsel and Knowledge are a Guard to the Sim∣plicity and Innocence of those of lower Talents and the Entertainment and Happiness of those of equal When a Man in a Country Life has this Turn as it is to be hoped Thousands have he lives in a more happy Condition than any is described in the Pastoral Descriptions of Poets or the vainglorious Solitudes recorded by Philo∣sophers  To a Thinking Man it would seem prodigious that the very Situation in a Country Life does  not incline Men to a Scorn of the mean Gratifi∣cations some take in it To stand by a Stream naturally lulls the Mind into Composure and Re∣verence to walk in Shades diversifies that Plea∣sure and a bright Sunshine makes a Man con∣sider all Nature in Gladness and himself the happiest Being in it as he is the most conscious of her Gifts and Enjoyments It would be the most impertinent Piece of Pedantry imaginable to form our Pleasures by Imitation of others I will not therefore mention  Scipio  and  Laelius  who are generally produced on this Subject as Authorities for the Charms of a Rural Life He that does not feel the Force of agreeable Views and Situations in his own Mind will hardly ar∣rive at the Satisfactions they bring from the Re∣flexions of others However they who have a Tast that Way are more particularly inflamed with Desire when they see others in the Enjoy∣ment of it especially when Men carry into the Country a Knowledge of the World as well as of Nature The Leisure of such Persons is en∣dear'd and refin'd by Reflexion upon Cares and Inquietudes The Absence of past Labours dou∣bles present Pleasures which is still augmented if the Person in Solitude has the Happiness of be∣ing addicted to Letters My Cousin  Frank Bicker∣staff  gives me a very good Notion of this sort of Felicity in the following Letter  SIR  I Write this to communicate to you the Hap∣piness I have in the Neighbourhood and Conversation of the noble Lord whose Health you enquired after in your last I have bought that little Hovel which borders upon his Royal∣ty but am so far from being oppressed by his Greatness that I who know no Envy and he who is above Pride mutually recommend our  selves to each other by the Difference of our For∣tunes He esteems me for being so well pleased with a little and I admire him for enjoying so handsomely a great deal He has not the little Tast of observing the Colour of a Tulip or the Edging of a Leaf of Box but rejoices in open Views the Regularity of this Plantation and the Wildness of another as well as the Fall of a River the Rising of a Promontory and all other Objects fit to entertain a Mind like his that has been long versed in great and pu∣blick Amusements The Make of the Soul is as much seen in Leisure as in Business He has long lived in Courts and been admired in As∣semblies so that he has added to Experience a most charming Eloquence by which he com∣municates to me the Idea's of my own Mind upon the Objects we meet with so agreeably that with his Company in the Fields I at once enjoy the Country and a Landskip of it He is now altering the Course of Canals and Ri∣vulets in which he has an Eye to his Neigh∣bour's Satisfaction as well as his own He often makes me Presents by turning the Water into my Grounds and sends me Fish by their own Streams To avoid my Thanks he makes Nature the Instrument of his Bounty and does all good Offices so much with the Air of a Com∣panion that his Frankness hides his own Con∣descension as well as my Gratitude Leave the World to it self and come see us  Your Affectionate Cousin  Francis Bickerstaff  The TATLER N  o    Fortuna saevo laeta negotio  Et Ludum insolentem ludere pertinax  Transmutat incertos Honores  Nunc mihi nunc alii benigna  Hor  From  Tuesday May  to  Thursday May    From my own Apartment  May  HAving this Morning spent some Time in read∣ing on the Subject of the Vicissitude of hu∣mane Life I laid aside my Book and began to ruminate on the Discourse which raised in me those Reflections I believed it a very good Of∣fice to the World to sit down and show others the Road in which I am experienced by my Wan∣drings and Errors This is  Seneca  's Way of Thinking and he had half convinced me how dangerous it is to our  ue Happiness and Tran∣quility to fix our Minds upon any Thing which is in the Power of Fortune It is excusable only in Animals who have not the Use of Reason to be catched by Hooks and Baits Wealth Glory and Power which the ordinary People look up at with Admiration the Learned and Wise know to be only so many Snares laid to enslave them There is nothing further to be sought for with Earnestness than what will cloath and feed us If we pamper our selves in our Diet or give our Imaginations a Loose in our Desires the Body will no longer obey the Mind Let us think no further than to defend our selves against Hunger Thirst and Cold We are to remember that every Thing else is despicable and not worth our Care To want little is true Grandeur and very  few Things are great to a great Mind Those who form their Thoughts in this Manner and ab∣stract themselves from the World are out of the Way of Fortune and can look with Contempt both on her Favours and her Frowns At the same Time they who separate themselves from the im∣mediate Commerce with the busy Part of Man∣kind are still beneficial to them while by their Studies and Writings they recommend to them the small Value which ought to be put upon what they pursue with so much Labour and Disquiet Whilst such Men are thought the most idle they are the most usefully employed They have all Things both Humane and Divine under Consi∣deration To be perfectly free from the Insults of Fortune we should arm our selves with their Reflections We should learn That none but in∣tellectual Possessions are what we can properly call our own All Things from without are but bor∣rowed What Fortune gives us is not ours and whatever she gives she can take away  It is a common Imputation to  Seneca  that tho' he declaimed with so much Strength of Reason and a Stoical Contempt of Riches and Power he was at the same Time one of the richest and most powerful Men in  Rome  I know no Instance of his being insolent in that Fortune and can there∣fore read his Thoughts on those Subjects with the more Deference I will not give Philosophy so poor a Look as to say it cannot live in Courts but I am of Opinion that it is there in the great∣est Eminence when amidst the Affluence of All the World can bestow and the Add esses of a Crowd who follow him for that Reason a Man can think both of himself and those about him abstracted from these Circumstances Such a Phi∣losopher is as much above an Anchorite as a wise Matron who passes through the World with Inno∣cence is preferable to the Nun who locks her self up from it  Full of these Thoughts I left my Lodgings and took a Walk to the Court End of the Town and the Hurry and Busy Faces I met with about  White∣hall  made me form to my self Ideas of the dif∣ferent Prospects of all I saw from the Turn and Cast of their Countenances All methought had the same Thing in View but prosecuted their Hopes with a different Air Some showed an un∣becoming Eagerness some a surly Impatience some a winning Deference but the Generality a servile Complaisance  I could not but observe as I roved about the Offices That all who were still but in Expecta∣tion murmured at Fortune and all who had ob∣tained their Wishes immediately began to say there was no such Being Each believed it an Act of blind Chance that any other Man was prefer∣red but owed only to Service and Merit what he had obtained himself It is the Fault of studious Men to appear in publick with too contemplative a Carriage and I began to observe that my Fi∣gure Age and Dress made me particular For which Reason I thought it better to remove a stu∣dious Countenance from among busy ones and take a Turn with a Friend in the  PrivyGarden  When my Friend was alone with me there  Isaac  said he I know you came Abroad only to Moralize and make Observations and I will car∣ry you hard by where you shall see all that you have your self considered or read in Authors or collected from Experience concerning blind For∣tune and irresistible Destiny illustrated in real Persons and proper Mechanisms The Graces the Muses the Fates all the Beings which have a good or ill Influence upon Humane Life are you'l say very justly figured in the Persons of Women and where I am carrying you you'l see enough

happened to be for some Days the De∣liberation at the Learned'st Board in this House whence Honour and Title had its first Original  Timoleon  who is very particular in his Opinions but is thought particular for no other Cause but that he acts against depraved Custom by the Rules of Nature and Reason in a very handsome Discourse gave the Company to under∣stand  That in those Ages which first degenera∣ted from Simplicity of Life and Natural Justice the Wise among them thought it necessary to in∣spire Men with the Love of Virtue by giving them who adhered to the Interests of Innocence and Truth some distinguishing Name to raise them above the common Level of Mankind This Way of fixing Appellations of Credit upon emi∣nent Merit was what gave Being to Titles and Terms of Honour Such a Name continued he without the Qualities which should give a Man Pretence to be exalted above others does but turn him to Jest and Ridicule Should one see another cudgelled or scurvily treated Do you think a Man so used would take it kindly to be called  Hector  or  Alexander  Every Thing must bear a Proportion with the outward Value that is set upon it or instead of being long had in Venera∣tion that very Term of Esteem will become a Word of Reproach When  Timoleon  had done speaking  Urbanus  pursued the same Purpose by giving an Account of the Manner in which the  Indian  Kings who were lately in  Great Britain  did Honour to the Person where they lodged They were placed said he in an handsome Apart∣ment at an Upholsterer's in  Kingstreet CoventGarden  The Man of the House it seems had been very observant of them and ready in their Service These just and generous Princes who act according to the Dictates of natural Justice thought it proper to confer some Dignity upon their Landlord before they left his House One of them had been sick during his Residence there and having never before been in a Bed had a very great Veneration for him who made that Engine of Repose so useful and so necessary in his Dist ress It was consulted among the Four Princes' by what Name to dignify his great Me∣  and Services The Emperor of the  Mohocks  nd the other Three Kings stood up and in that  Posture recounted the Civilities they had recei∣ved and particularly repeated the Care which was taken of their Sick Brother This in their Imagination who are used to know the Injuries of Weather and the Vicissitudes of Cold and Heat gave them very great Impressions of a skil∣ful Upholsterer whose Furniture was so well con∣trived for their Protection on such Occasions It is with these less instructed I will not say less knowing People the Manner of doing Honour to impose some Name significant of the Qualities of the Person they distinguish and the good Of∣fices received from him It was therefore resol∣ved to call their Landlord  Cadaroque  which is the Name of the strongest Fort in their Part of the World When they had agreed upon the Name they sent for their Landlord and as he entered into their Presence the Emperor of the  Mohocks  taking him by the Hand called him  Ca∣daroque  After which the other Three Princes re∣peated the same Word and Ceremony  Timoleon  appeared much satisfied with this Ac∣count and having a Philosophick Turn began to argue against the Modes and Manners of those Nations which we esteem polite and express himself with Disdain at our unusual Method of cal∣ling such as are Strangers to our Innovations bar∣barous I have says he so great a Deference for the Distinction given by these Princes that  Cada∣roque  shall be my UpholstererHe was go∣ing on but the intended Discourse was interrup∣ted by  Minucio  who sat near him a small Philo∣sopher who is also somewhat of a Politician one of those who sets up for Knowledge by Doubt∣ing and has no other Way of making himself considerable but by contradicting all he hears said He has besides much Doubt and Spirit of Contradiction a constant Suspicion as to StateAffairs This accomplish'd Gentleman with a very awful Brow and a Countenance full of  Weight told  Timoleon  That it was a great Mis∣fortune Men of Letters seldom looked into the Bottom of Things Will any Man continued he perswade me that this was not from the Begin∣ning to the End a concerted Affair Who can convince the World that Four Kings shall come over here and lie at the Two Crowns and Cushi∣on and one of them fall sick and the Place be called  Kingstreet  and all this by meer Accident No no To a Man of very small Penetration it appears that  Tee Yee Neen He Ga Row  Emperor of the  Mohocks  was prepared for

never∣theless  He Nec Yeth Taw No Row  knew it before he set Foot on the  English  Shore  Timoleon  looked stedfastly at him for some Time then shaked his Head paid for his Tea and marched off Several others who sat round him were in their Turns attacked by this ready Disputant A Gentleman who was at some Di∣stance happened in Discourse to say it was Four Miles to  Hammersmith  I must beg your Pardon says  Minucio  when we say a Place is so far off we do not mean exactly from the very Spot of Earth we are in but from the Town where we are so that you must begin your Account from the End of  Piccadilly  and if you do so I'll lay any Man Ten to One it is not above Three good Miles off Another about  Minucio  's Level of Understanding began to take him up in this im∣portant Argument and maintained That consi∣dering the Way from  Pimlico  at the End of  St James  's  Park  and the Crossing from  Chelsea  by  Earl  's  Court  he would stand to it that it was full Four Miles But  Minucio  replied with great Vehemence and seemed so much to have the bet∣ter of the Dispute that this Adversary quitted the  Field as well as the other I sat till I saw the Table almost all vanished where for Want of Discourse  Minucio  asked me How I did To which I answered Very well That's very much said he I assure you you look paler than ordinary Nay thought I if he won't allow me to know whether I am well or not there's no staying for me neither Upon which I took my Leave pon∣dering as I went Home at this strange Poverty of Imagination which makes Men run into the Fault of giving Contradiction They want in their Minds Entertainment for themselves or their Company and therefore build all they speak up∣on what is started by others and since they can∣not improve that Foundation they strive to de∣stroy it The only Way of dealing with these People is to answer in Monosyllables or by Way of Question When one of them tells you a Thing that he thinks extraordinary I go no fur∣ther than Say you so Sir Indeed Heyday Or Is it come to that These little Rules which appear but silly in the Repetition have brought me with great Tranquility to this Age And I have made it an Observation that as Assent is more agreeable than Flattery so Contradiction is more odious than Calumny  ADVERTISEMENT  Mr  Bickerstaff  's Aereal Messenger has brought him a Report of what passed at

 Hor  From  Saturd May  to  Tuesd May    From my own Apartment  May  WHEN a Man is in a serious Mood and ponders upon his own Make with a Re∣trospect to the Actions of his Life and the many fatal Miscarriages in it which he owes to ungo∣verned Passions he is then apt to say to himself That Experience has guarded him against such Errors for the future But Nature often recurs in Spite of his best Resolutions and it is to the very End of our Days a Struggle between our Reason and our Temper which shall have the Empire over us Hewever this is very much to be help∣ed by Circumspection and a constant Alarm against the first Onsets of Passion As this is in general a necessary Care to make a Man's Life easy and agreeable to himself so it is more parti∣cularly the Duty of such as are engaged in Friend∣ship and more near Commerce with others Those who have their Joys have also their Griefs in Proportion and none can extremely exalt or depress Friends but Friends The harsh Things which come from the rest of the World are re∣ceived and repulsed with that Spirit which every honest Man bears for his own Vindication but Unkindness in Words or Actions among Friends affect us at the first Instant in the inmost Reces∣ses of our Souls Indifferent People if I may so say can wound us only in heterogeneous Parts maim us in our Legs or Arms but the Friend can  make no Pass but at the Heart it self On the other Side the most impotent Assistance the meer well Wishes of a Friend gives a Man Con∣stancy and Courage against the most prevailing Force of his Enemies It is here only a Man en∣joys and suffers to the Quick For this Reason the most gentle Behaviour is absolutely necessary to maintain Friendship in any Degree above the com∣mon Level of Acquaintance But there is a Re∣lation of Life much more near than the most strict and sacred Friendship that is to say Marriage This Union is of too close and delicate a Nature to be easily conceived by those who do not know that Condition by Experience Here a Man should if possible soften his Passions if not for his own Ease in Compliance to a Creature formed with a Mind of a quite different Make from his own I am sure I do not mean it an Injury to Women when I say there is a Sort of Sex in Souls I am tender of offending them and know it is hard not to do it on this Subject but I must go on to say That the Soul of a Man and that of a Woman are made very unlike according to the Employments for which they are designed The Ladies will please to observe I say our Minds have different not superior Qualities to theirs The Virtues have respectively a Masculine and a Feminine Cast What we call in Men Wisdom is in Women Pru∣dence It is a Partiality to call one greater than the other A prudent Woman is in the same Class of Honour as a wise Man and the Scandals in the Way of both are equally dangerous But to make this State any Thing but a Burthen and not hang a Weight upon our very Beings it is very proper each of the Couple should frequent∣ly remember that there are many Things which grow out of their very Natures that are pardonable nay becoming when considered as such but without that Reflection must give the quickest Pain and Vexation To manage well a  great Family is as worthy an Instance of Capacity as to execute a great Employment and for the Generality as Women perform the considerable Part of their Duties as well as Men do theirs so in their common Behaviour those of ordinary Genius are not more trivial than the common Rate of Men and in my Opinion the playing of a Fan is every whit as good an Entertainment as the beating a SnuffBox  But however I have rambled in this Libertine Manner of Writing by way of Essay I now sat down with an Intention to represent to my Rea∣ders how pernicious how sudden and how fatal Surprizes of Passion are to the Mind of Man and that in the more intimate Commerces of Life they are most liable to arise even in our most sedate and indolent Hours Occurrences of this Kind have had very terrible Effects and when one reflects upon 'em we cannot but tremble to consider what we are capable of being wrought up to against all the Ties of Nature Love Honour Reason and Religion tho' the Man who breaks thro' them all had an Hour before he did so a lively and virtu∣ous Sense of their Dictates When unhappy Ca∣tastrophe's make up Part of the History of Princes and Persons who act in high Spheres or are re∣presented in the moving Language and well wrought Scenes of Tragedians they do not fail of striking us with Terror but then they affect us only in a transient Manner and pass thro' our Ima∣ginations as Incidents in which our Fortunes are too humble to be concerned or which Writers form for the Ostentation of their own Force or at most as Things fit rather to exercise the Pow∣ers of our Minds than to create new Habits in them Instead of such high Passages I was think∣ing it would be of great Use if any Body could hit it to lay before the World such Adventures as befall Persons not exalted above the common Level This methought would better prevail  upon the ordinary Race of Men who are so pre∣possessed with outward Appearances that they mi∣stake Fortune for Nature and believe nothing can relate to them that does not happen to such as live and look like themselves  The unhappy End of a Gentleman whose Story an Acquaintance of mine was just now telling me would be very proper for this End if it could be related with all the Circumstances as I heard it this Evening for it touched me so much that I cannot forbear entring upon it  Mr  Eustace  a young Gentleman of a good Estate near  Dublin  in  Ireland  married a Lady of Youth Beauty and Modesty and lived with her in gene∣ral with much Ease and Tranquility but was in his secret Temper impatient of Rebuke She is apt to fall into little Sallies of Passion yet as sud∣denly recalled by her own Reflection on her Fault and the Consideration of her Husband's Temper It happened as he his Wife and her Sister were at Supper together about Two Months ago that in the Midst of a careless and familiar Conversa∣tion the Sisters fell into a little Warmth and Con∣tradiction He who was one of that Sort of Men who are never unconcerned at what passes before them fell into an outragious Passion on the Side of the Sister The Person about whom they disputed was so near that they were under no Restraint from running into vain Repetitions of past Heats On which Occasion all the Aggravations of Anger and Distast boiled up and were repeated with the Bitterness of exasperated Lovers The Wife ob∣serving her Husband extremely moved began to turn it off and rally him for interposing between Two People who from their Infancy had been an∣gry and pleased with each other every Half Hour But it descended deeper into his Thoughts and they broke up with a sullen Silence The Wife immediately retired to her Chamber whither her Husband soon after followed When they were  in Bed he soon dissembled a Sleep and she plea∣sed that his Thoughts were composed fell into a real one Their Apartment was very distant from the rest of their Family in a lonely Country House He now saw his Opportunity and with a Dagger he had brought to Bed with him stabbed his Wife in the Side She awaked in the highest Terrour but immediately imagined it was a Blow design'd for her Husband by Ruffians began to grasp him and strove to awake and rouze him to defend him∣self He still pretended himself sleeping and gave her a second Wound  She now drew open the Curtains and by the Help of Moonlight saw his Hand lifted up to stab her The Horror disarmed her from further Struggling and he enraged anew at being disco∣vered fixed his Poniard in her Bosom As soon as he believed he had dispatched her he attempt∣ed to escape out of the Window But she still alive called to him not to hurt himself for she might live He was so stung with the insupport∣able Reflection upon her Goodness and his own Villany that he jumped to the Bed and wounded her all over with as much Rage as if every Blow was provoked by new Aggravations In this Fury of Mind he fled away His Wife had still Strength to go to her Sister's Apartment and give her an Account of this wonderful Tragedy but died the next Day Some Weeks after an Officer of Justice in attempting to seize the Criminal fired upon him as did the Criminal upon the Officer Both their Balls took Place and both immediately expired  The TATLER N  o    Sapientia prima est  Stultitia caruisse  Hor  From  Tuesday May  to  Thursday May    SheerLane  May  WHEN I first

done my Master any  ther Mischief than one Knock on the Pate This was a great Misfortune to me and I believe I  ay say without Vanity I am the first who ever  shed so erroneously and yet conquered the Pre∣  dice of Education so well as to make my Passes  clear and recover Hand and Foot with that  gility as I do at this Day The Truth of it is  e first Rudiments of Education are given very  discreetly by most Parents as much with Rela∣  on to the more important Concerns of the Mind  the Gestures of the Body Whatever Chil∣  en are designed for and whatever Prospects the  tune or Interest of their Parents may give  them in their future Lives they are all promis∣cuously instructed the same Way and  Horace  and  Virgil  must be thrummed by a Boy as well before he goes to an Apprenticeship as to the Univer∣sity This ridiculous Way of treating the Under∣aged of this Island has very often raised both my Spleen and Mirth but I think never both at once so much as to Day A good Mother of our Neighbourhood made me a Visit with her Son and Heir a Lad somewhat above Five Foot and wants but little of the Height and Strength of a good Musquetier in any Regiment in the Service Her Business was to desire I would examine him for he was far gone in a Book the first Letters of which she often saw in my Papers The Youth produced it and I found it was my Friend  Ho∣race  It was very easy to turn to the Place the Boy was learning in which was the Fifth Ode of the First Book of  Pyrrha  I read it over aloud as well because I am always delighted when I turn to the beautiful Parts of that Author as also to gain Time for considering a little how to keep up the Mother's Pleasure in her Child which I thought Barbarity to interrupt In the  Place I asked him Who this same  Pyrrhus  was He answered very readily She was the Wife of  Pyrrhus  one of  Alexander  's Captains I lifted up my Hands The Mother courtesiesNay says sheI knew you would stand in AdmirationI assure you continued she for all he looks so tall he is but very young Pray ask him some more never spare him Win that I took the Liberty to ask him What was the Character of this Gentlewoman He read the Three first Verses  Quis multa gracilis te Puer in rosa  Perfusus liquidis urget Odoribus  Grate Pyrrha sub Antro  And very gravely told me She lived at the Sign of the  Rose  in a Cellar I took Care to be very much astonished at the Lad's Improvements but withal advised her as soon as possible to take him from School for he could learn no more there This very silly Dialogue was a lively Image of the impertinent Method used in breeding Boys without Genius or Spirit to the reading Things for which their Heads were never framed But this is the natural Effect of a certain Vanity in the Minds of Parents who are wonderfully de∣lighted with the Thought of breeding their Chil∣dren to Accomplishments which they believe no∣thing but Want of the same Care in their own Fathers prevented them from being Masters of Thus it is that the Part of Life most fir for Im∣provement is generally 'employed in a Method against the Bent of Nature and a Lad of such Parts as are fit for an Occupation where there can be no Calls out of the beaten Path is Two or Three Years of his Time wholly taken up in knowing how well  Ovid  's Mistress became such a Dress how such a Nymph for her Cruelty was changed into such an Animal and how it is made generous in  Aeneas  to put  Turnus  to Death Gallantries that can no more come within the Oc∣currences of the Lives of ordinary Men than they can be relished by their Imaginations How∣ever still the Humour goes on from one Genera∣tion to another and the PastryCook here in the Lane the other Night told me He would not yet take away his Son from his Learning but has resolved as soon as he had a little Smattering in the Greek to put him Apprentice to a Soapboyl∣er These wrong Beginnings determine our Suc∣cess in the World and when our Thoughts are originally falsly biassed their Agility and Force do but carry us the further out of our Way in Proportion to our Speed But we are half Way our Journey when we have got into the right  Road If all our Days were usefully employed and we did not set out impertinently we should not have so many grotesque Proressors in all the Arts of Life but every Man would be in a pro∣per and becoming Method of distinguishing or entertaining himself suitably to what Nature de∣signed him As they go on now our Parents do not only force us upon what is against our Ta∣lents but our Teachers are also as injudicious in what they put us to learn I have hardly ever since suffered so much by the Charms of any Beauty as I did before I had a Sense of Passion for not apprehending that the Smile of  Lalage  was what pleased  Horace  and I verily believe the Stripes I suffered about  Digito male p rtinaci  has given that irreconcilable Aversion which I shall carry to my Grave against Coquets  As for the elegant Writer of whom I am talk∣ing his Excellencies are to be observed as they relate to the different Concerns of his Life and he is always to be looked upon as a Lover a Cour∣tier or a Man of Wit His admirable Odes have numberless Instances of his Merit in each of these Characters His Epistles and Satyrs are full of proper Notices for the Conduct of Life in a Court and what we call Good Breeding most agreeably intermixed with his Morality His Addresses to the Persons who favoured him are so inimitably engaging that  Augustus  complained of him for so seldom writing to him and asked him Whether he was afraid Posterity should read their Names together Now for the Generality of Men to spend much Time in such Writings is as plea∣sant a Folly as any he ridicules Whatever the Crowd of Scholars may pretend if their Way of Life or their own Imaginations do not lead then to a Tast of him they may read nay write Fifty Volumes upon him and be just as they were when they began I remember to have heard a great Painter say There are certain Faces for  certain Painters as well as certain Subjects for certain Poets This is as true in the Choice of Studies and no one will ever relish an Author thoroughly well who would not have been fit Company for that Author had they lived at the same Time All others are Mechanicks in Learn∣ing and take the Sentiments of Writers like WaitingServants who report what passed at their Masters Table but debase every Thought and Expression for want of the Air with which they were uttered  The TATLER N  o    Quem mala Stultitia aut

Mankind gives every Individual of that Species what he calls a Seity something peculiar to himself which makes him different from all other Persons in the World This Particularity renders him either venerable or ridiculous ac∣cording as he uses his Talents which always grow out into Faults or improve into Virtues In the Office I have undertaken you are to observe That I have hitherto presented only the more insignifi∣cant and lazy Part of Mankind under the Deno∣mination of Dead Men together with the De∣grees towards NonExistence in which others can neither be said to live or be defunct but are only Animals meerly dressed up like Men and differ from each other but as Flies do by a little Co∣louring  or Fluttering of their Wings Now as our Discourses heretofore have chiefly regarded the Indolent Part of the Species it remains that we do Justice also upon the impertinently Active and Enterprizing Such as these I shall take par∣ticular Care to place in safe Custody and have used all possible Diligence to run up my Edifice in  Moorfields  for that Service  We who are adept in Astrology can impute it to several Causes in the Planets That this Quarter of our great City is the Region of such Persons as either never had or have lost the Use of Reason It has indeed been Time out of Mind the Recep∣tacle of Fools as well as Madmen The Care and Information of the former I assign to other learned Men who have for that End taken up their Ha∣bitation in those Parts as among others to the famous Dr  Trotter  and my ingenious Friend Dr  Langham  These oraculous Proficients are Day

such as have Chances in the Publick Lottery Dr  Langham  shows a peculiar Genero∣sity on this Occasion taking only one HalfCrown for a Prediction Eighteen Pence of which to be paid out of the Prizes which Method the Doctor is willing to comply with in Favour of every Ad∣venturer in the whole Lottery Leaving there∣fore the whole Generation of such Enquirers to such  Litcrati  as I have now

which is born with Men of great Genius and which when it falls in with a noble Imagination is called Poeti∣cal Fury does not come under my Consideration  but the Pretence to such an Impulse without na∣tural Warmth shall be allowed a fit Object of this Charity and all the Volumes written by such Hands shall be from Time to Time placed in proper Order upon the Rails of the unhoused Booksellers

Opiates for those Patients whose high Imaginations and hot Spirits have waked them into Distraction Their boiling Tem∣pers are not to be wrought upon by my Gruels and Julips but must ever be employed

Sadness yet at the same Time keep the Faculties of the Rea∣ders in Suspence tho' they introduce no Idea's of their own By this Means a disordered Mind like a broken Limb will recover its Strength by the sole Benefit of being out of Use and lying without Motion But as Reading is not an Enter∣tainment that can take up the full Time of my Patients I have now in Pension a proportionable Number of StoryTellers who are by Turns to walk about the Galleries of the House and by their Narrations second the Labours of my pretty good Poets There are among these StoryTel∣lers some that have so earnest Countenances and weighty Brows that they will draw a Madman even when his Fit is just coming on into a Whis∣per and by the Force of Shrugs Nods and busy Gestures make him stand amazed so long as that we may have Time to give him his Broth without Danger  But as Fortune has the Possession of Men's Minds a Physician may cure all the sick People of ordi∣nary Degree in the whole Town and never come  into Reputation I shall therefore begin with Persons of Condition and the first I shall under∣take shall be the Lady  Fidget  the general Visitant and  Will Voluble  the fine Talker These Persons shall be first locked up for the Peace of all whom the one visits and all whom the other talks to  The Passion which first touched the Brain of both these Persons was Envy and has had such wondrous Effects that to this Lady  Fidget  owes that she is so courteous to this  Will Voluble  that he is eloquent  Fidget  has a restless Torment in hearing of any one's Prosperity and cannot know any Quiet till she visits her and is EyeWitness of something that lessens it Thus her Life is a continual Search after what does not concern her and her Companions speak kindly even of the Absent and the Unfortunate to teaze her She was the first that visited  Flavia  after the Smallpox and has never seen her since because she is not altered Call a young Woman hand∣some in her Company and she tells you It is pity she has no Fortune Say she is rich and she is as sorry that she is silly With all this ill Nature  Fidget  is her self young rich and handsome but loses the Pleasure of all those Qualities because she has them in common with others  To make up her Misery she is wellbred she hears Commendations till she is ready to faint for Want of venting her self in Contradictions This Madness is not expressed by the Voice but is ut∣tered in the Eyes and Features Its first Symp∣tom is upon beholding an agreeable Object a sudden Approbation immediately checked with Dislike  This Lady I shall take the Liberty to conduct into a Bed of Straw and Darkness and have some Hopes that after long Absence from the Light the Pleasure of seeing at all may reconcile her to what she shall see tho' it proves to be never so agreeable  My Physical Remarks on the Distraction of Envy in other Persons and particularly in  Will Voluble  is interrupted by a Visit from Mr  Kidney  with Advices

marked out betwixt  Vitry  and  Montigny  or from the Left to gain the Lines of Circumvallation betwixt  Fierin  and  Dechy  So that whatever Way the Enemy shall approach to attack us whether by the Plains of  Lens  or by  Bouchain  and  Valenciennes  we have but a very small Movement to make to possess our selves of the Ground on which it will be most advantagious to receive them The Enemy march∣ed this Morning from their Left and are encamp∣ed with their Right at  Oisy  and their Left to∣wards  Aeras  and according to our Advices will pass the  Scarp  to Morrow and enter on the Plains  of  Lens  though several Regiments of Horse the  German  and  Liege  Troops which are destined to compose Part of their Army have not yet joined them If they pass the  Scarp  we shall do the like at

Distribution of the Apartments in the New  Bedlam  proper Regard is had to the different Sexes and the Lodgings accommodated accordingly Among other Necessaries as I have thought fit to appoint StoryTellers to sooth the Men so I have allowed TaleBearers to indulge the Intervals of my Female Patients But before I enter upon disposing of the Main of the great Body that wants my Assistance it is necessary to consider the Humane Race abstracted from all other Distinctions and Considerations except that of Sex This will lead us to a nearer View of their Excellencies and Imperfections which are to be accounted the one or the other as they are suitable to the Design for which the Persons so defective or accomplished came into the World  To make this Enquiry aright we must speak of the Life of People of Condition and the pro∣portionable Applications to those below them will be easily made so as to value the whole Spe∣cies by the same Rule We will begin with the Woman and behold her as a Virgin in her Fa∣ther's House This State of her Life is infinitely more delightful than that of her Brother at the same Age While she is entertained with learn∣ing melodious Airs at her Spinet is led round a Room in the most complaisant Manner to a Fid∣dle or is entertained with Applauses of her Beauty and Perfection in the ordinary Conversa∣tion she meets with the young Man is under the Dictates of a rigid Schoolmaster or Instructor  contradicted in every Word he speaks and curb∣ed in all the Inclinations he discovers Mrs  Eli∣zabeth  is the Object of Desire and Admiration looked upon with Delight courted with all the Powers of Eloquence and Address approached with a certain Worship and defended with a cer∣tain Loyalty This is her Case as to the World In her Domestick Character she is the Compa∣nion the Friend and Confident of her Mother and the Object of a Pleasure something like the Love between Angels to her Father Her Youth her Beauty her Air are by him looked upon with an ineffable Transport beyond any other Joy in this Life with as much Purity as can be met with in the next  Her Brother  William  at the same Years is but in the Rudiments of those Acquisitions which must gain him Esteem in the World Hi Heart beats for Applause among Men yet is he fearful of every Step towards it If he proposes to him∣self to make a Figure in the World his Youth is damped with a Prospect of Difficulties Dangers and Dishonours and an Opposition in all gene∣rous Attempts whether they regard his Love or his Ambition  In the next Stage of Life she has little else to do but what she is accomplished for by the meer Gifts of Nature to appear lovely and agree∣able to her Husband tender to her Children and affable to her Servants But a Man when he en∣ters into this Way is but in the first Scene far from the Accomplishment of his Designs He is now in all Things to act for others as well as himself He is to have Industry and Frugality in his private Affairs and Integrity and Addresses in Publick To these Qualities he must add a Cou∣rage and Resolution to support his other Abilities lest he be interrupted in the Prosecution of his just Endeavours in which the Honour and In∣terest  of Posterity are as much concerned as his own personal Welfare  This little Sketch may in some Measure give an Idea of the different Parts which the Sexes have to act and the advantagious as well as in∣convenient Terms on which they are to enter upon their several Parts of Life This may also be some Rule to us in the Examination of their Conduct In short I shall take it for a Maxim That a Woman who resigns the Purpose of being pleasing and the Man who gives up the Thoughts of being wise do equally quit their Claim to the true Causes of Living and are to be allowed the Diet and Discipline of my charitable Structure to reduce them to Rea∣son  On the other Side the Woman who hopes to please by Mothods which should make her odious and the Man who would be thought wise by a Behaviour that renders him ridiculous are to be taken into Custody for their false Industry as Justly as they ought for their Negligence  N B  Mr  Bickerstaff  is taken extremely ill with

passing the  Scarp  on the th in the Evening and their March towards the Plains of  Lens  had put the Confederate Ar∣my in Motion which was advancing towards the Camp on the North Side of that River be∣tween  Vitry  and  HeninLietard  The Confede∣rates since the Approach of the Enemy have added several new Redoubts to their Camp and drawn the Cannon out of the Lines of Circum∣vallation in a Readiness for the Batteries  It is not believed notwithstanding these Ap∣pearances that the Enemy will hazard a Battle for the Relief of  Douay  the Siege of which Place is carried on with all the Success that can be expected considering the Difficulties they meet with occasioned by the Inundations On the th at Night we made a Lodgment on the Sa∣liant Angle of the Glacis of the Second Counter∣scarp and our Approaches are so far advanced that it is believed the Town will be obliged to surrender before the th of the next Month  The TATLER N  o    Nullum Numen abest si sit Prudentia  Juv  From  Tuesday May  to  Thursday May    From my own Apartment  May  THIS Evening after a little Ease from the raging Pain caused by so small an Organ as an aking Tooth under which I had behaved my self so ill as to have broke Two Pipes and my Spectacles I began to reflect with Admiration on those Heroick Spirits which in the Conduct of their Lives seem to live so much above the Con∣dition of our Make as not only under the Ago∣nies of Pain to forbear any intemperate Word or Gesture but also in their general and ordinary Behaviour to resist the Impulses of their very Blood and Constitution This Watch over a Man's self and the Command of his Temper I take to be the greatest of Humane Perfections and is the Effect of a strong and resolute Mind It is not only the most expedient Practice for  carrying on our own Designs but is also very de∣servedly the most amiable Quality in the Sight of others It is a winning Deference to Mankind which creates an immediate Imitation of it self wherever it appears and prevails upon all who have to do with a Person endued with it either through Shame or Emulation I do not know how to express this Habit of Mind except you will let me call it Equanimity It is a Virtue which is necessary at every Hour in every Place and in all Conversations and is the Effect of a regular and exact Prudence He that will look back upon all the Acquaintances he has had in his whole Life will find he has seen more Men capable of the greatest Employments and Perfor∣mances than such as could in the general Bent of their Carriage act otherwise than according to their own Complexion and Humour But the Indulgence of our selves in wholly giving Way to our natural Propensity is so unjust and improper a Licence that when People take it up there is very little Difference with Relation to their Friends and Families whether they are good or illnatured Men For he that errs by being wrought upon by what we call the Sweetness of his Temper is as guilty as he that offends thro' the Perverseness of it  It is not therefore to be regarded what Men are in themselves but what they are in their Actions  Eucrates  is the bestnatured of all Men but that natural Softness has Effects quite con∣trary to it self and for Want of due Bounds to his Benevolence while he has a Will to be a Friend to all he has the Power of being such to none His constant Inclination to please makes him never fail of doing so tho' without being capable of Falshood he is a Friend only to those who are present for the same Humour which makes him the best Companion renders him the worst Correspondent It is a melancholy Thing  to consider that the most engaging Sort of Men in Conversation are frequently the most tyranni∣cal in Power and least to be depended upon in Friendship It is certain this is not to be imputed to their own Disposition but he that is to be led by others has only good Luck if he is not the worst though in himself the best Man living For this Reason we are no more wholly to in∣dulge our good than our ill Dispositions I re∣member a crafty old Cit one Day speaking of a wellnatured young Fellow who set up with a good Stock in  Lombardstreet  "I will says he lay no more Money in his Hands for he never de∣nied me any Thing"  This was a very base but with him a prudential Reason for breaking off Commerce And this Acquaintance of mine car∣ried this Way of Judging so far that he has often told me he never cared to deal with a Man he liked for that our Affections must never enter into our Business  When we look round us in this populous City and consider how Credit and Esteem are lodged you find Men have a great Share of the former without the least Portion of the latter He who knows himself for a Beast of Prey looks upon others in the same Light and we are so apt to judge of others by our selves that the Man who has no Mercy is as careful as possible never to want it Hence it is that in many Instances Men gain Credit by the very contrary Methods by which they do Esteem for wary Traders think every Affection of the Mind a Key to their Cash  But what led me into this Discourse was my Impatience of Pain and I have to my great Disgrace seen an Instance of the contrary Car∣riage in so high a Degree that I am out of Countenance that I ever read  Seneca  When I look upon the Conduct of others in such Occur∣rences as well as behold their Equanimity in the  general Tenour of their Life it very much abates the SelfLove which is seldom well governed by any Sort of Men and least of all by us Au∣thors  The Fortitude of a Man who brings his Will to the Obedience of his Reason is conspicuous and carries with it a Dignity in the lowest State imaginable Poor  Martius  who now lies lan∣guishing in the most violent Fever discovers in the faintest Moments of his Distemper such a Greatness of Mind that a perfect Stranger who should now behold him would indeed see an Object of Pity but at the same Time that it was lately an Object of Veneration His gal∣lant Spirit resigns but resigns with an Air that speaks a Resolution which could yield to nothing but Fate it self This is Conquest in the Philo∣sophick Sense but the Empire over our selves is methinks no less laudable in common Life where the whole Tenour of a Man's Carriage is in Subservience to his own Reason and Confor∣mity both to the good Sense and Inclination of other Men  Aristaeus  is in my Opinion a perfect Master of himself in all Circumstances He has all the Spirit that Man can have and yet is as regular in his Behaviour as a meer Machine He is sen∣sible of every Passion but ruffled by none In Conversation he frequently seems to be less knowing to be more obliging and chuses to be on a Level with others rather than oppress with the Superiority of his Genius In Friendship he is kind without Profession In Business ex∣peditious without Ostentation With the greatest Softness and Benevolence imaginable he is im∣partial in Spight of all Importunity even that of his own good Nature He is ever clear in his Judgment but in Complaisance to his Com∣pany speaks with Doubt and never shows Con∣fidence in Argument but to support the Sense of  another Were such an Equality of Mind the general Endeavour of all Men How sweet would be the Pleasures of Conversation He that is loud would then understand that we ought to call a Constable and know that spoiling good Company is the most heinous Way of breaking the Peace We should then be relieved from these Zealots in Society who take upon them to be angry for all the Company and quarrel with the Waiters to show they have no Respect for any Body else in the Room To be in a Rage before you is in a Kind being angry with you You may as well stand naked before Company as to use such Familiarities and to be careless of what you say is the most clownish Way of being undressed  SheerLane  May  When I came Home this Evening I found the following Letters and because I think one a very good Answer to the other as well as that it is the Affair of a young Lady it must be im∣mediately dismissed  SIR  I Have a good Fortune partly paternal and partly acquired My younger Years I spent in Business but

 Penkethman  the Come∣dian has lately left here a Paper or Ticket to which is affixed a small Silver Medal which is to entitle the Bearer to see One and twenty Plays at his Theatre for a Guinea  Greenwith  is the Place where it seems he has erected h s House and his Time of Action is to be so contri∣ved that it is to fall in with going and returning with the Tide Besides that the Bearer of this Ticket may carry down with him a particular Set of Company to the Play striking off for each Person so introduced one of his Twenty one Times of Admittance In this Warrant of his he has made me an high Compliment in a face∣tious Distich by Way of Dedication of his En∣deavours and desires I would recommend them to the World I must needs say I have not for some Time seen a properer Choice than he has made of a Patron Who more fit to publish his Work than a Novelist Who to recommend it than a Censor This Honour done me has made me turn my Thoughts upon the Nature of Dedi∣cations in general and the Abuse of that Cu∣stom as well by a long Practice of my Predeces∣sors as the continued Folly of my contemporary Authors  In ancient Times it was the Custom to ad∣dress their Works to some eminent for their Merit to Mankind or particular Patronage of the Wri∣ters themselves or Knowledge in the Matter of which they treated Under these Regards it was a memorable Honour to both Parties and a very agreeable Record of their Commerce with each other These Applications were never stuf∣fed with impertinent Praises but were the native Product of their Esteem which was implicitly re∣ceived or generally known to be due to the Patron of the Week But vain Flourishes came into the World with other barbarous Embellishments and the Enumeration of Titles and great Actions in the Patrons themselves or their Sires are as foreign to the Matter in Hand as the Ornaments are in a  Gothick  Building This is clapping to∣gether Persons which have no Manner of Alli∣ance and can for that Reason have no other Ef∣fect than making both Parties justly ridiculous What Pretence is there in Nature for me to write to a great Man and tell him My Lord because your Grace is a Duke your Grace's Father before you was an Earl his Lordship's Father was a Baron and his Lordship's Father both a wise and a rich Man I  Isaac Bickerstaff  am obliged and could not possibly forbear addressing to you the following Treatise Though this is the plain Exposition of all I could possibly say to him with a good Conscience yet the silly Custom has so universally prevailed that my Lord Duke and I must necessarily be particular Friends from this Time forward or else I have just Room for be∣ing disobliged and may turn my Panegyrick in∣to a Libel But to carry this Affair still more Home were it granted that Praises in Dedications were proper Topicks What is it that gives a Man Authority to commend or what makes it a Favour to me that he does commend me It is certain that there is no Praise valuable but from  the Praiseworthy Were it otherwise Blame might be as much in the same Hands Were the Good and Evil of Fame laid upon a Level among Mankind the Judge on the Bench and the Cri∣minal at the Bar would differ only in their Sta∣tions and if one's Word is to pass as much as the other's their Reputation would be much alike to the Jury  Pliny  speaking of the Death of  Martial  expresses himself with great Gratitude to him for the Honours done him in the Writings of that Author but he begins it with an Ac∣count of his Character whsch only made the Applause valuable He indeed in the same Epi∣stle says It is Sign we have left off doing Things which deserve Praise when we think Commendation impertinent This is asserted with a just Regard to the Persons whose good Opinion we wish for otherwise Reputation would be valued according to the Number of Voices a Man has for it which are not always to be insured on the more virtuous Side But how∣ever we pretend to model these nice Affairs true Glory will never attend any Thing but Truth and there is something so peculiar in it that the very selfsame Action done by different Men can∣not merit the same Degree of Applause The  Roman  who was surprized in the Enemy's Camp before he had accomplished his Design and thrust his bare Arm into a flaming Pile telling the General There were many as determined as himself who against Sense of Danger had con∣spired his Death wrought in the very Enemy an Admiration of his Fortitude and a Dismission with Applause But the condemned Slave who represented him in the Theatre and consumed his Arm in the same Manner with the same Re∣solution did not raise in the Spectators a great Idea of his Virtue but of him whom imitated in an Action no Way differing from that of the real  Scaevola  but in the Motive to it  Thus true Glory is inseparable from true Merit and whatever you call Men they are are no more than what they are in themselves but a Roman∣tcik Sense has crept into the Minds of the Gene∣rality who will ever mistake Words and Appear∣ances for Persons and Things  The Simplicity of the Ancients was as conspi∣cuous in the Address of their Writings as in any other Monuments they have left behind them  Caesar  and  Augustus  were much more high Words of Respect when added to Occasions fit for their Characters to appear in than any Appellations which have ever been since thought of The lat∣ter of these great Men had a very pleasant Way of dealing with Applications of this Kind When he received Pieces of Poetry which he thought had Worth in them he rewarded the Writer but where he thought them empty he generally returned the Compliment made him with some Verses of his own  This latter Method I have at present Occasion to imitate A Female Author has dedicated a Piece to me wherein she would make my Name as she has others the Introduction of whatever is to follow in her Book and has spoke some Panegyrical Things which I know not how to return for Want of better Acquaintance with the Lady and consequently being out of a Capacity of giving her Praise or Blame All therefore that is left for me according to the foregoing Rules is to lay the Picture of a good and evil Woman be∣fore her Eyes which are but meet Words if they do not concern her Now you are to observe the Way in a Dedication is to make all the rest of the World as little like the Person we address to as possible according to the following Epistle  MADAM  But M  Memorabile nullum  Faminea in Pana est  The TATLER N  o    From  Saturd May  to  Tuesd May    SheerLane  May  WHEN we look into the delightful History of the most ingenious  Don Quixot  of the  Mancha  and consider the Exercises and Manner of Life of that renowned Gentleman we cannot but admire the exquisite Genius and discerning Spirit of  Michael Cervantes  who has not only painted his Adventurer with great Mastery in the conspicuous Parts of his Story which relate to Love and Honour but also intimated in his ordi∣nary Life Oeconomy and Furniture the infalli∣ble Symptoms he gave of his growing Phrensy before he declared himself a KnightErrant His Hall was furnished with old Launces Halbards and Morrions his Food Lentils his Dress amorous He slept moderately rose early and spent his Time in Hunting When by Watchful∣ness and Exercise he was thus qualified for the Hardships of his intended Peregrinations he had nothing more to do but to fall hard to study and before he should apply himself to the Practi∣cal Part get into the Methods of making Love and War by reading Books of Knighthood As for raising tender Passion in him  Cervantes  re∣ports That he was wonderfully delighted with a smooth intricate Sentence and when they listened at his StudyDoor they could frequently hear him read aloud  The Reason of the Unreaso∣nableness which against my Reason is wrought doth so weaken my Reason as with all Reason I do justly complain on your Beauty  Again he would pause till he came to another charming Sentence  and with the most pleasing Accent imaginable be loud at a new Paragraph  The high Heavens which with your Divinity do fortify you divinely with the Stars make you Deserveress of the De∣serts that your Greatness deserves  With these and other such Passages  say's my Author  the poor Gentleman grew distracted and was break∣ing his Brains Day and Night to understand and unravel their Sense  As much as the Case of this distempered Knight is received by all the Readers of his History as the most incurable and ridiculous of all Phren∣sies it is very certain we have Crowds among us far gone in as visible a Madness as his though they are not observed to be in that Condition As great and useful Discoveries are sometimes made by accidental and small Beginnings I came to the Knowledge of the most Epidemick Ill of this Sort by falling into a Coffeehouse where I saw my Friend the Upholsterer whose Crack to∣wards Politicks I have heretofore mention'd This Touch in the Brain of the  British  Subject is as certainly owing to the reading NewsPapers as that of the  Spanish  Worthy abovemention'd to the reading Works of Chivalry My Contem∣poraries the Novelists have for the better spin∣ning out Paragraphs and working down to the End of their Columns a most happy Art in Say∣ing and Unsaying giving Hints of Intelligence and Interpretations of indifferent Actions to the great Distur bance of the Brains of ordinary Rea∣ders This Way of going on in the Words and making no Progress in the Sense is more parti∣cularly the Excellence of my most ingenious and renowned FellowLabourer the  PostMan  and it as to this Talent in him that I impute the Loss of my Upholsterer's Intellects That unfortunate Tradesman has for Years past been the chief Ora∣tor in ragged Assemblies and the Reader in Al∣  y Coffeehouses He was Yesterday surroun∣ded  by an Audience of that Sort among whom I sat unobserved through the Favour of a Cloud of Tobacco and saw him with the  PostMan  in his Hand and all the other Papers safe under his Left Elbow He was intermixing Remarks and reading the  Paris  Article of  May  which says  That it is given out that an Express arrived this Day with Advice that the Armies were so near in the Plain of  Lens  that they cannonaded each other  Ay ay here we shall have Sport  And that it was highly probable the next Express would bring us an Account of an Engagement  They are welcome as soon as they please  The some others say That the same will be put off ti  the    d or    d of  June  because the Mareschal  Vil∣lars  expects some further Reinforcements from  Ger∣many  and other Parts before that Time  WhataPox does he put it off for Does he think our Horse is not marching up at the same Time But let us see what he says further  They hope that Monsieur  Albergotti  being encouraged by the Presence of so great an Army will make an extra∣ordinary Defence  Why then I find  Albergun  is one of those that love to have a great many on their SideNay I'll say that for this Paper he makes the most natural Inferences of any of them all  The Elector of  Bavaria  being uneasy to be without any Command has desired Leave to come to Court to communicate a certain Project to his MajestyWhatever it be it is said that Prince is suddenly expected and then we shall have a more certain Account of his Project if this  ∣port has any Foundation  Nay this Paper new imposes upon us he goes upon sure Grounds for he won't be positive the Elector has a Project or that he will come or if he does come at all for he doubts you see whether the Report has any Foundation  What makes this the more lamentable is that this Way of Writing falls in with the Imagina∣tion  of the cooler and duller Part of Her Maje∣sty's Subjects The being kept up with one Line contradicting another and the whole after many Sentences of Conjecture vanishing in a Doubt whether there is any Thing at all in what the Person has been reading of puts an ordinary Head into a Vertigo which his natural Dulness would have secured him from Next to the La∣bours of the  PostMan  the Upholsterer took from under his Elbow honest  Icabod Dawks  's Letter and there among other Speculations the Histo∣rian takes upon him to say  That it is discoursed that there will be a Battel in  Flanders  before the Armies separate and many will have it to be to Morrow the great Battel of  Ramelies  being fought on a  WhitSunday A Gentleman who was a Wag in this Company laughed at the Expression and said By Mr  Dawks  's Favour I warrant ye  f we meet them on  WhitSunday  or  M  nday  we shall not stand upon the Day with them whether it be before or after the Holidays An Admirer of this Gentleman stood up and told a Neighbour at a distant Table the Conceit at which indeed we were all very merry These Reflections in the Writers of the Transactions of the Times seize the Noddles of such as were  ot born to have Thoughts of their own and  onsequently lay a Weight upon every Thing which they read in Print But Mr  Dawks  con∣  luded this Paper with a courteous Sentence which was very well taken and applauded by  he whole Company  We wish  says he  all our  ustomers a merry  Whitsuntide  and many of  hem  Honest  Icabod  is as extraordinary a Man  s any of our Fraternity and as particular His  tyle is a Dialect between the Familiarity of Talk∣  g and Writing and his Letter such as you  annot distinguish whether Print or Manuscript  hich gives us a Refreshment of the Idea from  hat has been told us from the Press by others  This wishing a good Tide had its Effect upon us  and he was commended for his Salutation a  showing as well the Capacity of a Bellman a  an Historian My distempered old Acquaintanc  read in the next Place the Account of the Affairs abroad in the  Courant  but the Matter was told so distinctly that these Wanderers thought there was no News in it this Paper differing from the rest as an History from a Romance The Tauto∣logy the Contradictions the Doubts and Wants of Confirmations are what keep up imaginary Entertainments in empty Heads and produce Neglect of their own Affairs Poverty and Bank∣rupcy in many of the ShopStatesmen but turn the Imaginations of those of a little higher Orb into Deliriums of Dissatisfaction which is seen in a continual Fret upon all that touches their Brains but more particularly upon any Ad∣vantage obtained by their Country where they are considered as Lunaticks and therefore tole∣rated in their Ravings  What I am now warning the People of is That the NewsPapers of this Island are as per∣nicious to weak Heads in  England  as ever Books of Chivalry to  Spain  and therefore shall do all that in me lies with the utmost Care and Vigi∣lance imaginable to prevent these growing E  A framing Instance of this Malady appeared in my old Acquaintance at this Time who after he had done reading all his Papers ended with a Thoughtful Air  If we should have a Peace we should then know for certain whether it was the King of  Sweden  that lately came to  Dunkirk I whispered him and desired him to step aside a little with me When I had Opportunity I de∣ceived him into a Coach in order for his mo  easy Conveyance to  Moorfields  The Man  very quietly with me and by that Time he had brought the  Swede  from the Defeat by the  to the  Boristhenes  we were passing by  Will's  Cof∣fee  house where the Man of the House beckon'd to us We made a full Stop and could hear from above a very loud Voice swearing with some Expressions towards Treason That the Sub∣ject in  France  was as free as in  England  His Di∣stemper would not let him reflect that his own Discourse was an Argument of the contrary They told him One would speak with him be∣low He came immediately to our CoachSide I whispered him That I had an Order to carry him to the  Bastile  He immediately obeyed with great Resignation For to this Sort of Lunatick whose Brain is touched for the  French  the Name of a Gaol in that Kingdom has a more agreeable Sound than that of a Paternal Seat in this their own Country It happen'd a little unluckily bringing these Lunaticks together for they im∣mediately fell into a Debate concerning the Great∣ness of their respective Monarchs one for the King of  Sweden  the other for the Grand Mo∣narch of  France  This Gentleman from  Will  's is now next Door to the Upholsterer safe in his Apartment in my  Bedlam  with proper Medica∣ments and the  Mercure Gallant  to sooth his Ima∣gination that he is actually in  France  If there∣fore he should escape to  CoventGarden  again all Persons are desired to lay hold of him and de∣liver him to Mr  Morphew  my Overseer At the same Time I desire all true Subjects to forbear Discourse with him any otherwise than when he begins to fight a Battle for  France  to say  Sir I hope to see you in  England  The TATLER N  o    Oh quis me gelidis sub Montibus Haem  Sistat ingenti Ramorum protegat Umbra  From  Tuesday

the following Letter  SIR  I Believe you will forgive me though I wri  to you a very long Epistle since it relates  the Satisfaction of a Country Life which  know you would lead if you could In t  first Place I must confess to you That I a  one of the most luxurious Men living and  I am such I take Care to make my Pleasu  lasting by following none but such as are i  ¦nocent and refined as well as in some Measu  improving You have in your Labours been  much concerned to represent the Actions  Passions of Mankind that the whole Veget  World has almost escaped your Observati  But sure there are Gratifications to be dr  from thence which deserve to be recom  ¦ded For your better Information I wish  could visit your old Friend in  Cornwal  would be pleased to see the many Alter  I have made about my House and how  I have improved my Estate without raising  Rents of it  As the Winter ingrosses with us near a dou∣ble Portion of the Year the Three delightful Vicissitudes being crowded almost within the Space of Six Months there is nothing upon which I have bestowed so much Study and Ex∣pence as in contriving Means to soften the Se∣verity of it and if possible to establish Twelve chearful Months about my Habitation In order to this the Charges I have been at in building and furnishing a GreenHouse will perhaps be thought somewhat extravagant by a great many Gentlemen whose Revenues ex∣ceed mine But when I consider that all Men of any Life and Spirit have their Inclinations to gratify and when I compute the Sums laid out by the Generality of the Men of Pleasure in the Number of which I always rank my self in riotous Eating and Drinking in Equi∣page and Apparel upon Wenching Gaming Racing and Hunting I find upon the Bal∣lance that the indulging of my Humour comes at a reasonable Rate  Since I communicate to you all Incidents se∣rious and trifling even to the Death of a But∣terfly that fall out within the Compass of my little Empire you will not I hope be ill plea∣sed with the Draught I now send you of my little Winter Paradise and with an Account of my Way of amusing my self and others in it  The younger  Pliny  you know writes a long Letter to his Friend  Gallus  in which he gives him a very particular Plan of the Situation the Conveniencies and the Agreeableness of his Villa In my last you may remember I pro∣mised you something of this Kind Had  Pliny  lived in a Northern Climate I doubt not but we should have found a very compleat Oran∣gery amongst his Epistles and I probably should have copied his Model instead of Build∣ing  after my own Fancy and you had been re∣ferred to him for the History of my late Ex∣ploits in Architecture By which Means my Performances would have made a better Figure at least in Writing than they are like to make at present  The Area of my Greenhouse is a Hundred Paces long Fifty broad and the Roof Thirty Foot high The Wall toward the North is of solid Stone On the South Side and at both the Ends the Stonework rises but Three Foot from the Ground excepting the Pilasters pla∣ced at convenient Distances to strengthen and beautify the Building The intermediate Spaces are filled up with large Sashes of the strongest and most transparent Glass The Middle Sash which is wider than any of the other serves for the Entrance to which you mount by Six easy Steps and descend on the Inside by as many This opens and shuts with greater Ease keeps the Wind out better and is at the same Time more uniform than FoldingDoors  In the Middle of the Roof there runs a Ciel∣ing Thirty Foot broad from one End to the other This is enlivened by a Masterly Pencil with all the Variety of Rural Scenes and Pro∣spects which he has peopled with the whole Tribe of Silvan Deities Their Characters and their Stories are so well expressed that the whole seems a Collection of all the most beau∣tiful Fables of the ancient Poets translated into Colours The remaining Spaces of the Roof Ten Foot on each Side of the Cieling are of the clearest Glass to let in the Sky and Clouds from above The Building points full East and  West  so that I enjoy the Sun while he is about the Horizon His Rays are improved through the Glass and I receive through it what is de∣sirable in a WinterSky without the coarse Allay of the Season which is a Kind of sifting  or straining the Weather My Greens and Flowers are as sensible as I am of this Benefit They flourish and look chearful as in the Spring while their FellowCreatures abroad are star∣ved to Death I must add that a moderate Expence of Fire over and above the Contribu∣tions I receive from the Sun serves to keep this large Room in a due Temperature it be∣ing sheltered from the cold Winds by a Hill on the North and a Wood on the East  The Shell you see is both agreeable and con∣venient and now you shall judge whether I have laid out the Floor to Advantage There goes through the whole Length of it a spacious Walk of the finest Gravel made to bind and unite so firmly that it seems one continued Stone with this Advantage that it is easier to the Foot and better for walking than if it were what it seems to be At each End of the Walk on the one and on the other Side of it lies a square Plot of Grass of the finest Turf and brightest Verdure What Ground remains on both Sides between these little smooth Fields of Green is flagged with large Quarries of white Marble where the blue Veins trace out such a Variety of irregular Windings thro' the clear Surface that these bright Plains seem full of Rivulets and Streaming Meanders This to my Eye that delights in Simplicity is inexpressibly more beautiful than the che∣quered Floors which are so generally admired by others Upon the Right and upon the Left along the Gravel Walk I have ranged inter∣changeably the Bay the Mirtle the Orange and the Lemon Trees intermixed with painted Hollies Silver Firs and Pyramids of Yew all so disposed that every Tree receives an additio∣nal Beauty from its Situation besides the Har∣mony that rises from the Disposition of the whole no Shade cuts too strongly or breaks in  harshly upon the other but the Eye is cheare  with a mild rather than gorgeous Diversity  Greens  The Borders of the Four GrassPlots are gar¦nished with Pots of Flowers Those Delicacie  of Nature recreate Two Senses at once an  leve such delightful and gentle Impression  upon the Brain that I cannot help thinking them of equal Force with the softest Airs o  Musick toward the smoothing of our Tem∣pers In the Center of every Plot is a Statue  The Figures I have made Choice of are a  Venus  an  Adonis  a  Diana  and an  Apollo  such excel∣lent Copies as to raise the same Delight as we should draw from the Sight of the ancient Originals  The North Wall would have been but a tire∣some Waste to the Eye if I had not diversified it with the most lively Ornaments suitable to the Place To this Intent I have been at the Expence to lead over Arches from a neighbour∣ing Hill a plentiful Store of SpringWater which a beautiful  Naiade  placed as high as is possible in the Center of the Wall pours out from an Urn This by a Fall of above Twen∣ty Foot makes a most delightful Cascade into a Basin that opens wide within the MarbleFloor on that Side At a reasonable Distance on either Hand of the Cascade the Wall is hollowed into Two spreding Scallops each of which receives a Couch of green Velvet and forms at the same Time a Canopy over them Next to them come Two large Aviaries which are likewise let into the Stone These are succeeded by Two Grotto's set off with all the pleasing Rudeness of Shells and Moss and cragged Stones imitating in Miniature Rocks and Precipices the most dreadful and gigantick Works of Nature After the Grotto's you have Two Niches the one inhabited by  Ceres  with her Sickle and Sheaf of Wheat and the other by  Pomona  who with a Countenance full of good Cheer pours a bounteous Autumn of Fruits out of her Horn Last of all come Two Colonies of Bees whose Stations lying East and West the one is saluted by the Ri∣sing the other by the Setting Sun These all of them being placed at proportioned Intervals furnish out the whole Length of the Wall and the Spaces that lie between are painted in Fresco by the same Hand that has enriched my Cieling  Now Sir you see my whole Contrivance to elude the Rigour of the Year to bring a Nor∣thern Climate nearer the Sun and to exempt my self from the common Fate of my Coun∣trymen I must detain you a little longer to tell you That I never enter this delicious Re∣tirement but my Spirits are revived and a sweet Complacency diffuses it self over my whole Mind And how can it be otherwise with a Conscience void of Offence where the Musick of Falling Waters the Symphony of Birds the gentle Humming of Bees the Breath of Flowers the fine Imagery of Painting and Sculpture In a Word the Beauties and the Charms of Nature and of Art court all my Faculties refresh the Fibres of the Brain and smooth every Avenue of Thought What plea∣sing Meditations what agreeable Wanderings of the Mind and what delicious Slumbers have I enjoyed here And when I turn up some Masterly Writer to my Imagination me∣thinks here his Beauties appear in the most ad∣vantagious Light and the Rays of his Genius shoot upon me with greater Force and Bright∣ness than ordinary This Place likewise keeps the whole Family in good Humour in a Season wherein Gloominess of Temper prevails uni∣versally in this Island My Wife does often  touch her Lute in one of the Grotto's and my Daughter sings to it while the Ladies with you amidst all the Diversions of the Town and in the most affluent Fortunes are fretting and repining beneath a lowering Sky for they know not what In this Green House we often dine we drink Tea we dance CountryDances and what is the chief Pleasure of all we enter∣tain our Neighbours in it and by this Means contribute very much to mend the Climate Five or Six Miles about us I am  Your most humble Servant  T S  The TATLER N  o    Stultitiam patiuntur Opes  Hor  From  Thursd June  to  Saturd June    From my own Apartment  June  I Have received a Letter which accuses me of Partiality in the Administration of the Censorship and says That I have been very free with the lower Part of Mankind but ex∣tremely cautious in Representations of Matters which concern Men of Condition This Cor∣respondent takes upon him also to say the Up∣holsterer was not undone by turning Politician but became Bankrupt by trusting his Goods to Persons of Quality and demands of me that I should do Justice upon such as brought Poverty and Distress upon the World below them while  they themselves were sunk in Pleasures and Luxury supported at the Expence of those very Persons whom they treated with a Negligence as if they did not know whether they dealt with them or not This is a very heavy Accusation both of me and such as the Man aggrieved ac∣cuses me of tolerating For this Reason I re∣solved to take this Matter into Consideration and upon very little Meditation could call to my Memory many Instances which made this Com∣plaint far from being groundless The Root of this Evil does not always proceed from Injustice in the Men of Figure but often from a false Grandeur which they take upon them in being unacquainted with their own Business not con∣sidering how mean a Part they act when their Names and Characters are subjected to the little Arts of their Servants and Dependants The Overseers of the Poor are a People who have no great Reputation for the Discharge of their Trust but are much less scandalous than the Overseers of the Rich Ask a young Fellow of a great Estate Who was that odd Fellow spoke to him in a publick Place He answers One that does any Business It is with many a natural Conse∣quence of being a Man of Fortune that they are not to understand the Disposal of it and they long to come to their Estates only to put them∣selves under new Guardianship Nay I have known a young Fellow who was regularly bred an Attorney and was a very expert one till he had an Estate fallen to him The Moment that happened he who could before prove the next Land he cast his Eye upon his own and was so sharp that a Man at first Sight would give him a small Sum for a general Receipt whether he owed him any Thing or not Such a one I say have I seen upon coming to an Estate forget all  Diffidence of Mankind and become the most manageable Thing breathing He immediately  wanted a stirring Man to take upon him his A  ¦fairs to receive and pay and do every Thi  which he himself was now too fine a Gentlema  to understand It is pleasant to consider Th  he who would have got an Estate had he n  come to one will certainly starve because o  fell to him But such Contradictions are we  our selves and any Change of Life is insupporta¦ble to some Natures  It is a mistaken Sense of Superiority to believ  a Figure or Equipage gives Men Precedence  their Neighbours Nothing can create Respe  from Mankind but laying Obligations upo  them and it may very reasonably be conclude  that if it were put into a due Ballance accordin  to the true State of the Account many who b  ¦lieve themselves in Possession of a large Share  Dignity in the World must give Place to the  Inferiors The greatest of all Distinctions i  Civil Life is that of Debtor and Creditor an  there needs no great Progress in Logick to kno  which in that Case is the advantagious Sid  He who can say to another Pray Master o  Pray my Lord give me my own can as justl  tell him It is a Phantastical Distinction you tak  upon you to pretend to pass upon the World fo  my Master or Lord when at the same Tim  that I wear your Livery you owe me Wages  or while I wait at your Door you are ashame  to see me till you have paid my Bill  The good old Way among the Gentry of  Eng¦land  to maintain their Preeminence over the lower Rank was by their Bounty Munificence  and Hospitality and it is a very unhappy Change  if at present by themselves or their Agents  Luxury of the Gentry is supported by the Cre∣dit of the Trader This is what my Correspon∣dent pretends to prove out of his own Books and those of his whole Neighbourhood He has the Confidence to say That there is a MugHouse  hear  LongAcre  where you may every Evening hear an exact Account of Distresses of this Kind One complains That such a Lady's Finery is the Occasion that his own Wife and Daughter appear so long in the same Gown Ano∣ther That all the Furniture of her Visiting A∣partment are no more her's than the Scenery of a Play are the proper Goods of the Actress Nay at the lower End of the same Table you may hear a Butcher and Poulterer say That at their proper Charge all that Family has been maintained since they last came to Town  The free Manner in which People of Fashion are discoursed on at such Meetings is but a just Reproach for their Failures in this Kind but the melancholy Relations of the great Necessities Tradesmen are driven to who support their Credit in Spight of the faithless Promises which are made them and the Abatement which they suffer when paid by the Extortion of Upper Ser∣vants is what would stop the most thoughtless Man in the Career of his Pleasures if rightly re∣presented to him  If this Matter be not very speedily amended I shall think fit to print exact Lists of all Per∣sons who are not at their own Disposal though above the Age of Twenty one and as the Tra∣der is made Bankrupt for Absence from his A∣bode so shall the Gentleman for being at Home  f when Mr  Morphew  calls he cannot give him an exact Account of what passes in his own Fa∣mily After this fair Warning no one ought to think himself hardly dealt with if I take upon me to pronounce him no longer Master of his Estate Wife or Family than he continues to  mprove cherish and maintain them upon the  asis of his own Property without Incursions  pon his Neighbour in any of these Particu∣    According to that

Fortune shall no longer appro¦priate Distinctions but Nature direct us in th  Disposition both of Respect and Discountenance  As there are Tempers made for Command and others for Obedience so there are Men born for acquiring Possessions and others incapable of be∣ing other than meer Lodgers in the Houses of their Ancestors and have it not in their very Composition to be Proprietors of any Thing These Men are moved only by the meer Effects of Impulse Their GoodWill and Disesteem are to be regarded equally for neither is the Effect of their Judgment This loose Temper is that which makes a Man what  Sallust  so well remarks to happen frequently in the same Person to be covetous of what is another's and profuse of what is his own This Sort of Men is usually amiable to ordinary Eyes but in the Sight of Reason nothing is laudable but what is guided by Reason The covetous Prodigal is of all o∣thers the worst Man in Society If he would but take Time to look into himself he would find his Soul all over gashed with broken Vows and Promises and his Retrospect on his Action  would not consist of Reflections upon those good Resolutions after mature Thought which are the true Life of a reasonable Creature but the  nauseous Memory of imperfect Pleasures idle Dreams and occasional Amusements To fol∣low such dissatisfying Pursuits is it possible to suffer the Ignominy of being unjust I

Regard to strict Justice in the Com∣merce of Life can be capable of no good Action in any other Kind but he who lives below his Income lays up every Moment of Life Ar∣mour against a base World that

THere are those among Mankind who can enjoy no Relish of their Being except the World is made acquainted with all that relates  to them and think every Thing lost that passes un∣observed but others find a solid Delight in stealing by the Crowd and modelling their Life after such a Manner as is as much above the Approbation as the Practice of the Vulgar Life being too short to give Instances great enough of true Friendship or GoodWill some Sages have thought it pious to preserve a certain Reverence for the Manes of their deceased Friends and have withdrawn themselves from the rest of the World at certain Seasons to commemorate in their own Thoughts such of their Acquaintance who have gone before them out of this Life And indeed when we are advanced in Years there is not a more pleasing Entertainment than to recollect in a gloomy Moment the many we have parted with that have been dear and agree∣able to us and to cast a melancholy Thought or Two after those with whom perhaps we have indulged our selves in whole Nights of Mirth and Jollity With such Inclinations in my Heart I went to my Closet yesterday in the Evening and resolved to be sorrowful upon which Occa∣sion I could not but look with Disdain upon my self that though all the Reasons which I had to lament the Loss of many of my Friends are now as forcible as at the Moment of their Departure yet did not my Heart swell with the same Sor∣row which I felt at that Time but I could without Tears reflect upon many pleasing Ad∣ventures I have had with some who have long been blended with common Earth Though it is by the Benefit of Nature that Length of Time thus blots out the Violence of Afflictions yet with Tempers too much given to Pleasure it is almost necessary to revive the old Places of Grief in our Memory and ponder Step by Step on past Life to lead the Mind into that Sobriety of Thought which poises the Heart and makes it beat with due Time without being quickened  with Desire or retarded with Despair from its proper and equal Motion When we wind up a Clock that is out of Order to make it go well for the future we do not immediately set the Hand to the present Instant but we make it strike the Round of all its Hours before it can recover the Regularity of its Time Such thought I shall be my Method this Evening and since it is that Day of the Year which I dedicate to the Memory of such in another Life as I much delighted in when living an Hour or Two shall be sacred to Sorrow and their Memory while I run over all the melancholy Circumstances of this Kind which have occurred to me in my whole Life  The first Sense of Sorrow I ever knew was upon the Death of my Father at which Time I was not quite Five Years of Age but was rather amazed at what all the House meant than pos∣sessed with a real Understanding why no Body was willing to play with me I remember I went into the Room where his Body lay and my Mo∣ther sate weeping alone by it I had my Battle∣dore in my Hand and fell a beating the Coffin and calling Papa for I know not how I had some slight Idea that he was locked up there My Mother catched me in her Arms and trans∣ported beyond all Patience of the silent Grief she was before in she almost smothered me in her Embrace and told me in a Flood of Tears Papa could not hear me and would play with me no more for they were going to put him un∣der Ground whence he could never come to us again She was a very beautiful Woman of a noble Spirit and there was a Dignity in her Grief amidst all the Wildness of her Transport which methought struck me with an Instinct of Sorrow which before I was sensible of what it was to grieve seized my very Soul and has made Pity the Weakness of my Heart ever since The Mind in Infancy is methinks like the Body  in Embrio and receives Impressions so forcible that they are as hard to be removed by Reason as any Mark with which a Child is born is to be taken away by any future Application Hence it is that GoodNature in me is no Merit but having been so frequently overwhelmed with her Tears before I knew the Cause of any Af∣fliction or could draw Defences from my own Judgment I imbibed Commiseration Remorse and an unmanly Gentleness of Mind which has since insnared me into Ten Thousand Calamities and from whence I can reap no Advantage ex∣cept it be that in such an Humour as I am now in I can the better indulge my self in the Soft∣nesses of Humanity and enjoy that sweet An∣xiety which arises from the Memory of past Af∣flictions  We that are very old are better able to re∣member Things which befel us in our distant Youth than the Passages of later Days For this Reason it is that the Companions of my strong and vigorous Years present themselves more im∣mediately to me in this Office of Sorrow Un∣timely or unhappy Deaths are what we are most apt to lament so little are we able to make it in∣different when a Thing happens though we know it must happen Thus we groan under Life and bewail those who are relieved from it Every Object that returns to our Imagination raises different Passions according to the Circum∣stance of their Departure Who can have lived in an Army and in a serious Hour reflect upon the many gay and agreeable Men that might long have flourished in the Arts of Peace and not join with the Imprecations of the Father∣less and Widow on the Tyrant to whose Ambi∣tion they fell Sacrifices But gallant Men who are cut off by the Sword move rather our Vene∣ration than our Pity and we gather Relief enough from their own Contempt of Death to  make it no Evil which was approached with so much Chearfulness and attended with so much Honour But when we turn our Thoughts from the great Parts of Life on such Occasions and instead of lamenting those who stood ready to give Death to those from whom they had the Fortune to receive it I say when we let our Thoughts wander from such noble Objects and consider the Havock which is made among the Tender and the Innocent Pity enters with an unmixed Softness and possesses all our Souls at once  Here were there Words to express such Senti∣ments with proper Tenderness I should record the Beauty Innocence and untimely Death of the first Object my Eyes ever beheld with Love The beauteous Virgin How ignorantly did she charm how carelesly excel Oh Death Thou hast Right to the Bold to the Ambitious to the High and to the Haughty but why this Cruel∣ty to the Humble to the Meek to the Un∣discerning to the Thoughtless Nor Age nor Business nor Distress can erase the dear Image from my Imagination In the same Week I saw her dressed for a Ball and in a Shrowd How ill did the Habit of Death become the Prerty Trifler I still behold the smiling EarthA large Train of Disasters were coming on to my Memory when my Servant knocked at my Closer Door and interrupted me with a Letter attended with a Hamper of Wine of the same Sort with that which is to be put to Sale on  Thursday  next at  Garraway  's Coffeehouse Upon the Receipt of it I sent for Three of my Friends We are so intimate that we can be Company in whatever State of Mind we meet and can enter∣tain each other without expecting always to re∣joice The Wine we found to be generous and warming but with such an Heat as moved us rather to be chearful than frolicksome It re∣vived  the Spirits without firing the Blood We commended it till Two of the Clock this Morn∣ing and having to Day met a little before Din∣ner we found that though we drank Two Bottles a Man we had much more Reason to recollect than forget what had passed the Night before  The TATLER N  o    Spectaret Populum Ludis attentius ipsis  Hor  From  Tuesd June  to  Thursd June    SheerLane  June  THE Town grows so very empty that the greater Number of my gay Character are fled out of my Sight into the Country My  Beaus  are now Shepherds and my  Belles  Wood Nymphs They are lolling over Rivulets and covered with Shades while we who remain in Town hurry through the Dust about Imperti∣nencies without knowing the Happiness of Lei∣sure and Retirement To add to this Calamity even the Actors are going to desert us for a Sea∣son and we shall not shortly have so much as a Landskip or FrostScene to refresh our selve within the Midst of our Fatigues This may not perhaps be so sensible a Loss to any other as to me for I confess it is one of my greatest De∣lights to sit unobserved and unknown in the Gal∣lery and entertain my self either with what is personated on the Stage or observe what Ap∣pearances present themselves in the Audience If there were no other good Consequences in a Playhouse than that so many Persons of diffe∣rent  Ranks and Conditions are placed there in  heir most pleasing Aspects that Prospect only would be very far from being below the Plea∣sures of a wise Man There is not one Person you can see in whom if you look with an In∣clination to be pleased you may not behold some∣  hing worthy or agreeable Our Thoughts are  n our Features and the Visage of these in whom Love Rage Anger Jealousy or Envy have their frequent Mansions carries the Traces of those Passions wherever the Amorous the Cholerick the Jealous or the Envious are plea∣ed to make their Appearance However the As∣sembly at a Play is usually made up of such as have a Sense of some Elegance in Pleasure by which Means the Audience is generally composed of those who have gentle Affections or at least of such as at that Time are in the best Humour you can ever find them This has insensibly a good Effect upon our Spirits and the Musical Airs which are play'd to us put the whole Com∣pany into a Participation of the same Pleasure and by Consequence for that Time equal in Hu∣nour in Fortune and in Quality Thus far we gain only by coming into an Audience but if we find added to this the Beauties of proper Action the Force of Eloquence and the Gaiety of wellplaced Lights and Scenes it is being happy and seeing others happy for Two Hours  Duration of Bliss not at all to be slighted by  shortlived a Creature as Man Why then  hould not the Duty of the Player be had in much more Esteem than it is at present If the Merit of a Performance be to be valued according  o the Talents which are necessary to it the Qualifications of a Player should raise him much  bove the Arts and Ways of Life which we call Mercenary or Mechanick When we look round  full House and behold so few that can though  ey set themselves out to Show as much as the  Persons on the Stage do come up to what the would appear even in dumb Show How much does the Actor deserve our Approbation who adds to the Advantage of Looks and Motions the Tone of Voice the Dignity the Humili∣ry the Sorrow the Triumph suitable to the Character he personates  It may possibly be imagined by severe Men that I am too frequent in the Mention of the Theatrical Representations But who is not ex∣cessive in the Discourse of what he extremely likes  Eugenio  can lead you to a Gallery of fine Pictures which Collection he is always increa∣sing  Crassus  through Woods and Forrests to which he designs to add the neighbouring Coun∣ties These are great and noble Instances of their Magnificence The Players are my Pi∣ctures and their Scenes my Territories By com∣municating the Pleasure I take in them it may in some Measure add to Men's Gratifications this Way as viewing the Choice and Wealth of  En∣genio  and  Crassus  augments the Enjoyments of those whom they entertain with a Prospect of such Possessions as would not otherwise fall with∣in the Reach of their Fortunes  It is a very good Office one Man does another when he tells him the Manner of his being plea∣sed and I have often thought that a Com∣ment upon the Capacities of the Players would very much improve the Delight that Way and impart it to those who otherwise have no Sense of it  The First of the present Stage are  Wilks  and  Cibber  perfect Actors in their different Kinds  Wilks  has a singular Talent in representing the Graces of Nature  Cibber  the Deformity in th  Affectation of them Were I a Writer of Plays  I should never employ either of them in Pai  which had not their Bent this Way This  seen in the immitable Strain and Ruin of go  Humour which is kept up in the Chara∣cter of  Wildair  and in the nice and delicate Abuse of Understanding in that of  Sir Novel∣ty Cibber  in another Light hits exquisitely the flat Civility of an affected GentlemanUsher and  Wilks  the easy Frankness of a Gen∣tleman  If you would observe the Force of the same Capacities in higher Life Can any Thing be more ingenuous than the Behaviour of Prince  Harry  when his Father checks him Any Thing more exasperating than that of  Richard  when he insults his Superiors To beseech gracefully to approach respectfully to pity to mourn to love are the Places wherein  Wilks  may be made to shine with the utmost Beauty To rally plea∣santly to scorn artfully to flatter to ridicule and to neglect are what  Cibber  would perform with no less Excellence  When Actors are considered with a View to  heir Talents it is not only the Pleasure of that Hour of Action which the Spectators gain from  heir Performance but the Opposition of Right  nd Wrong on the Stage would have its Force  the Assistance of our Judgments on other Oc∣  asions I have at present under my Tutelage a  oung Poet who I design shall entertain the Town the ensuing Winter And as he does me  he Honour to let me see his Comedy as he writes it I shall endeavour to make the Parts fit  he Genio's of the several Actors as exactly as  heir Habits can their Bodies And because the Two I have mentioned are to perform the prin∣  ipal Parts I have prevailed with the House to  t the  Careless Husband  be acted on  Tuesday  ext that my young Author may have a View  f a Play which is acted to Perfection both  them and all concerned in it as being born  ithin the Walls of the Theatre and written  ith an exact Knowledge of the Abilities of the  Performers Mr  Wilks  will do his best in this Play because it is for his own Benefit and Mr  Cib∣ber  because he writ it Besides which all the great Beauties we have left in Town or with∣in Call of it will be present because it is the last Play this Season This Opportunity will I hope inflame my Pupil with such gene∣rous Notions from seeing this fair Assembly as will be then present that his Play may be composed of Sentiments and Characters proper to be presented to such an Audience His Dra∣ma at present has only the OutLines drawn There are I find to be in it all the Reve∣rend Offices of Life such as Regard to Parents Husbands and honourable Lovers preserved with the utmost Care and at the same Time that Agreeableness of Behaviour with the In∣termixture of pleasing Passions as arise from Innocence and Virtue interspersed in such a Manner as that to be charming and agreea∣ble shall appear the natural Consequence of be∣ing virtuous This great End is one of those i propose to do in my Censorship but if I  d a thin House on an Occasion when such a Work is to be promoted my Pupil shall return to his Commons at  Oxford  and  SheerLane  and the Theatres be no longer Corre∣spondents  The TATLER N  o    Fuit haec Sapientia quondam  Publica Privatis secernere  Hor  From  Thursd June  to  Saturd June    From my own Apartment  June  WHEN Men look into their own Bosoms and consider the generous Seeds which are there planted that might if rightly cultiva∣ted ennoble their Lives and make their Virtue venerable to Futurity How can they without Tears reflect on the universal Degeneracy from that publick Spirit which ought to be the first and principal Motive of all their Actions In the  Graecian  and  Roman  Nations they were wise enough to keep up this great Incentive and it was impossible to be in the Fashion without be∣ing a Patriot All Gallantry had its first Source from hence and to want a Warmth for the Pu∣blick Welfare was a Defect so scandalous that he who was guilty of it had no Pretence to Ho∣nour or Manhood What makes the Depravity among us in this Behalf the more vexatious and irksome to reflect upon is that the Contempt of Life is carried as far amongst us as it could be in those memorable People and we want only a proper Application of the Qualities which are frequent among us to be as worthy as they There is hardly a Man to be found who will not light upon any Occasion which he thinks may taint his own Honour Were this Motive as strong in every Thing that regards the Publick as it is in this our private Case no Man would  pass his Life away without having distinguished himself by some gallant Instance of his Zeal to∣wards it in the respective Incidents of his Life and Profession But it is so far otherwise that there cannot at present be a more ridiculous Ani∣mal than one who seems to regard the Good of others He in Civil Life whose Thoughts turn upon Schemes which may be of general Benefit without further Reflection is call'd a Projector and the Man whose Mind seems intent upon glo∣rious Atchievements a Knight Errant The Ri∣dicule among us runs strong against laudable Actions Nay in the ordinary Course of Things and the common Regards of Life Negligence of the Publick is an Epidemick Vice The Brewer in his Excise the Merchant in his Cu∣stoms and for ought we know the Soldier in his MusterRolls think never the worse of them∣selves for being guilty of their respective Fraud towards the Publick This Evil is come to such a phantastical Height that he is a Man of a pub¦lick Spirit and heroically affected to his Coun¦try who can go so far as even to turn Usure with all he has in her Funds There is not a Ci¦tizen in whose Imagination such a one does no  appear in the same Light of Glory as  Codr  Scaevola  or any other great Name in Old  Rom  Were it not for the Heroes of so much  per Cen  as have Regard enough for themselves and the  Nation to trade with her with their Wealth th  very Notion of publick Love would long e'  now have vanished from among us But ho  ever general Custom may hurry us away in th  Stream of a common Error there is no Evil  Crime so great as that of being cold in Ma  ¦ters which relate to the common Good This  in nothing more conspicuous than in a certa  Willingness to receive any Thing that tends  the Diminution of such as have been conspicuo  Instruments in our Service Such Inclinatio  proceed from the most low and vile Corruption of which the Soul of Man is capable This ef∣faces not only the Practice but the very Appro∣bation of Honour and Virtue and has had such an Effect that to speak freely the very Sense of Publick Good has no longer a Part even in our Conversations Can then the most generous Mo∣tive of Life the Good of others be so easily banish'd the Breast of Man Is it possible to draw all our Passions inward Shall the boiling Heat of Youth be sunk in Pleasures the Ambition of Manhood in selfish Intrigues Shall all that is glorious all that is worth the Pursuit of great Minds be so easily rooted out When the uni∣versal Bent of a People seems diverted from the Sense of their common Good and common Glory it looks like a Fatality and Crisis of impending Misfortune  The generous Nations we just now mentioned understood this so very well that there was hard∣ly an Oration ever made which did not turn upon this general Sense That the Love of their Country was the first and most essential Quality in an honest Mind  Demosthenes  in a Cause wherein his Fame Reputation and Fortune were embarked puts his All upon this Issue  Let the Athenians  says he  be benevolent to me as they think I have been zealons for them  This great and discerning Orator knew there was no∣thing else in Nature could bear him up against his Adversaries but this one Quality of having shown himself willing or able to serve his Coun∣try This certainly is the Test of Merit and the first Foundation for deserving Good Will is having it your self The Adversary of this Ora∣tor at that Time was  Aeschines  a Man of wily Arts and Skill in the World who could as Oc¦casion served fall in with a National Start of Passion or Sullenness of Humour which a whole Nation is sometimes

bound by an Oath that he would return to  Car¦thage  if he failed in his Commission He pro¦poses this to the Senate who were in Suspen  upon it which  Regulus  observing without h  ¦ving the least Notion of putting the Care of h  own Life in Competition with the publick Good desired them to consider that he was old and al∣most useless that those demanded in Exchange were Men of daring Tempers and great Merit in Military Affairs and wondered they would make any Doubt of permitting him to go back to the short Tortures prepared for him at  Car∣thage  where he should have the Advantage of ending a long Life both gloriously and usefully This generous Advice was consented to and he took his Leave of his Country and his weeping Friends to go to certain Death with that chear∣ful Composure as a Man after the Fatigue of Business in a Court or a City retires to the next Village for the Air  The TATLER N  o    Una de multis Face Nuptiali  Digna  Hor  From  Saturday June  to  Tuesday June    From my own Apartment  June  THere are certain Occasions of Life which give propitious Omens of the future good Conduct of it as well as others which explain our present inward State according to our Beha∣viour in them Of the latter Sort are Funerals of the former Weddings The Manner of our Carriage when we lose a Friend shows very much our Temper in the Humility of our Words and Actions and a general Sense of our destitute Condition which runs through all our Deport∣ment This gives a solemn Testimony of the ge∣nerous Affection we bore our Friends when we  seem to disrelish every Thing now we can no more enjoy them or see them partake in our En∣joyments It is very proper and humane to put our selves as it were in their Livery after their Decease and wear a Habit unsuitable to Prosperity while those we loved and honoured are mouldring in the Grave As this is laudable on the sorrowful Side so on the other Incidents of Success may no less justly be represented and acknowledged in our outward Figure and Carriage Of all such Occasions that great Change of a Single Life into Marriage is the most important as it is the Source of all Relations and from whence all other Friendship and Commerce do principally arise The general Intent of both Sexes is to dis∣pose of themselves happily and honourably in this State and as all the good Qualities we have are exerted to make our Way into it so the best Ap∣pearance with Regard to their Minds their Per∣sons and their Fortunes at the first Entrance in∣to it is a Due to each other in the married Pair as well as a Compliment to the rest of the World It was an Instruction of a wise Lawgiver That unmarried Women should wear such loose Habits which in the flowing of their Garb should incite their Beholders to a Desire of their Persons and that the ordinary Motion of their Bodies might display the Figure and Shape of their Limbs in such a Manner as at once to preserve the strictest Decency and raise the warmest Inclina∣tions  This was the Oeconomy of the Legislator for the Increase of People and at the same Time for the Preservation of the Genial Bed She who was the Admiration of all who beheld her while unmarried was to bid adieu to the Pleasure of shining in the Eyes of many as soon as she took upon her the wedded Condition However there was a Festival of Life allowed the New∣married a Sort of intermediate State between  Celibacy and Matrimony which continued cer∣tain Days During that Time Entertainments Equipages and other Circumstances of Rejoi∣cing were encouraged and they were permitted to exceed the common Mode of Living that the Bride and Bridegroom might learn from such Free∣doms of Conversation to run into a general Con∣duct to each other made out of their past and future State so to temper the Cares of the Man and the Wife with the Gieties of the Lover and Mistress  In those wise Ages the Dignity of Life was kept up and on the Celebration of such Solem∣nities there were no impertinent Whispers and senseless Interpretations put upon the unaffected Chearfulness or accidental Seriousness of the Bride but Men turn'd their Thoughts upon the general Reflections upon what Issue might probably be expected from such a Couple in the succeeding Course of their Life and felicitated them accor∣dingly upon such Prospects  I must confess I cannot from any ancient Ma∣nuscripts Sculptures or Medals deduce the Rise of our celebrated Custom of throwing the Stock∣ing but have a faint Memory of an Account a Friend gave me of an original Picture in the Pa∣lace of  Aldobrandini  in  Rome  This seems to show a Sense of this Affair very different from what is usual among us It is a  Grecian  Wed∣ding and the Figures represented are a Person offering Sacrifice a beautiful Damsel dancing and another playing on the Harp The Bride is placed in her Bed the Bridegroom sits at the Feet of it with an Aspect which intimates his Thoughts were not only entertained with the Joys with which he was surrounded but also with a noble Gratitude and Divine Pleasure in the Offering which was then made to the Gods to invoke their influence on his new Condition There appears in the Face of the Woman a Mixture of Fear  Hope and Modesty in the Bridegroom a well∣governed Rapture As you see in great Spirits Grief which discovers it self the more by for∣bearing Tears and Complaints you may observe also the highest Joy is too big for Utterance the Tongue being of all the Organs the least capable of expressing such a Circumstance The Nuptial Torch the Bower the Marriage Song are all Particulars which we meet with in the Allusions of the ancient Writers and in every one of them something is to be observed which denotes their Industry to aggrandize and adorn this Occasion above all others  With us all Order and Decency in this Point is perverted by the insipid Mirth of certain Ani∣mals we usually call Wags These are a Species of all Men the most insupportable One can∣not without some Reflection say whether their flat Mirth provokes us more to Pity or to Scorn but if one considers with how great Affectation they utter their frigid Conceits Commiseration imme∣diately changes it self into Contempt  A Wag is the last Order even of Pretenders to Wit and good Humour He has generally his Mind prepared to receive some Occasion of Mer∣riment but is of himself too empty to draw any out of his own Set of Thoughts and therefor  laughs at the next Thing he meets not because i  is ridiculous but because he is under a Necessit  of Laughing A Wag is one that never in its Lif  saw a beautiful Object but sees what it does see  in the most low and most inconsiderable Light  can be placed There is a certain Ability nece  ¦sary to behold what is amiable and worthy  our Approbation which little Minds want an  attempt to hide by a general Disregard to ever  Thing they behold above what they are able  relish Hence it is that a Wag in an Assembl  is ever guessing how well such a Lady slept la  Night and how much such a young Fellow  pleas'd with himself The Wag's Gaiety consists in a certain professed ill Breeding as if it were an Excuse for committing a Fault that a Man knows he does so Tho' all publick Places are full of Persons of this Order yet because I will not allow Impertinence and Affectation to get the better of native Innocence and Simplicity of Man∣ners I have in Spite of such little Disturbers of publick Entertainments perswaded my Brother  Tranquillus  and his Wife my Sister  Jenny  in Fa∣vour of Mr  Wilks  to be at the Play to Morrow Evening  They as they have so much good Sense as to act naturally without Regard to the Observation of others will not I hope be discomposed if any of the Fry of Wags should take upon them to make themselves merry upon the Occasion of their coming as they intend in their Wedding Clothes My Brother is a plain worthy and honest Man and as it is natural for Men of that Turn to be mightily taken with sprightly and airy Women my Sister has a Vivacity which may perhaps give Hopes to Impertinents but will be esteemed the Effect of Innocence among wife Men They design to sit with me in the Box which the House have been so complaisant to offer me whenever I think fit to come thither in my publick Character  I do not in the least doubt but the true Figure of Conjugal Affection will appear in their Looks and Gestures My Sister does not affect to be gor∣geous in her Dress and thinks the Happiness of a Wife is more visible in a chearful Look than a gay Apparel It is a hard Task to speak of Per∣sons so nearly related to one with Decency but I may say all who shall be at the Play will allow him to have the Mien of a worthy  English  Gen∣tleman her that of a notable and deserving Wife  The TATLER N  o    Notitiam primosque Gradus Vicinia fecit  Tempore crevit Amor Taedae quoque forte coissent  Sed vetuere Patres quod non potuere vetare  Ex aequo captis ardebant Mentibus ambo  Ovid de Pyr This  From  Tuesday June  to  Thursday June    From my own Apartment  June  AS soon as I was up this Morning my Man gave me the following Letter which since it leads to a Subject that may prove of common Use to the World I shall take Notice of with as much Expedition as my Fair Petitioner could desire  Mr  Bickerstaff  SInce you have so often declared your self a Patron of the Distressed I must acquaint you that I am Daughter to a Country Gentle∣man of good Sense and may expect or  l  for my Fortune I love and am beloved by  Phi¦lander  a young Gentleman who has an Estate of  l per Annum  and is our near Neighbour in the Country every Summer My Father  though he has been a long Time acquainted with it constantly refuses to comply with ou  mutual Inclinations But what most of all tor¦ments me is That if ever I speak in Commen¦dation of my Lover he is much louder in hi  Praises than my self and professes that 'tis ou  of pure Love and Esteem for  Philander  as wel  as his Daughter that he can never consent w  should marry each other when as he terms it we may both do so much better It must indeed be confessed that Two Gentlemen of considerable Fortunes made their Addresses to me last Winter and  Philander  as I have since learn'd was offered a young Heiress with  l  but it seems we could neither of us think that accepting those Matches would be doing better than remaining constant to our first Passion Your Thoughts upon the Whole may perhaps have some Weight with my Father who is one of your Admirers as is  Your Humble Servant  Silvia  P S  You are desired to be speedy since my Father daily presses me to accept of what he calls an Advantageous Offer  There is no Calamity in Life that falls heavier upon humane Nature than a Disappointment in Love especially when it happens between Two Persons whose Hearts are mutually engaged to each other It is this Distress which has given Occasion to some of the finest Tragedies that were ever written and daily fills the World with Me∣lancholy Discontent Phrensy Sickness Despair and Death I have often admired at the Barba∣rity of Parents who so frequently interpose their Authority in this grand Article of Life I would fain ask  Silvia  's Father Whether he thinks he can bestow a greater Favour on his Daughter than to put her in a Way to live happily Whe∣ther a Man of  Philander  's Character with  l per Annum  is not more likely to contribute to that End than many a young Fellow whom he may have in his Thoughts with so many Thou∣sands Whether he can make Amends to his Daughter by any Increase of Riches for the Loss  of that Happiness she proposes to her self in her  Philander  Or whether a Father should com∣pound with his Daughter to be miserable though she were to get  l  by the Bargain I sup∣pose he would have her reflect with Esteem on his Memory after his Death And does he think this a proper Method to make her do so when as of∣ten as she thinks on the Loss of her  Philander  she must at the same Time remember him as the cruel Cause of it Any transientill Humour is soon forgotten but the Reflection of such a Cruelty must continue to raise Resentments as long as Life it self and by this one Piece of Barbarity an indulgent Father loses the Merit of all his past Kindnesses It is not impossible but she may de∣ceive her self in the Happiness which she propo∣ses from  Philander  but as in such a Case she can have no one to blame but her self she will bear the Disappointment with greater Patience but if she never makes the Experiment however happy she may be with another she will still think she might have been happier with  Philan∣der  There is a kind of Sympathy in Souls that fits them for each other and we may be assured when we see Two Personsengaged in the Warmths of a mutual Affectation that there are certain Qua∣lities in both their Minds which bear a Resem∣blance to one another A generous and constant Passion in an agreeable Lover where there is not too great a Disparity in other Circumstances is the greatest Blessing that can befal the Person be∣loved and if overlooked in one may perhaps never be found in another I shall conclude this with a celebrated Instance of a Father's Indul∣gence in this Particular which though carried to an Extravagance has something in it so tender and amiable as may justly reproach the Hardness of Temper that is to be met with in many a  Bri∣tish  Father  Antiochus  a Prince of great Hopes fell passio∣nately in Love with the young Queen  Stratonice  who was his MotherinLaw and had bore a Son to the old King  Seleucus  his Father The Prince finding it impossible to extinguish his Passion fell sick and refused all manner of Nourishment be∣ing determined to put an End to that Life which was become insupportable  Erasistratus  the Physician soon found that Love was his Distemper and observing the Alteration in his Pulse and Countenance whenever  Stratonice  made him a Visit was soon satisfied that he was dying for his young MotherinLaw Knowing the old King's Tenderness for his Son when he one Morning enquired of his Health he told him That the Prince's Distemper was Love but that it was incurable because it was impossible for him to possess the Person whom he loved The King surprised at this Account desired to know how his Son's Passion could be incurable Why Sir replied  Erasistratus  because he is in Love with the Person I am married to  The old King immediately conjured him by all his past Favours to save the Life of his Son and Successor Sir said  Erasistratus  Would your Ma∣jesty but fancy your self in my Place you would see the Unreasonableness of what you desire Hea∣ven is my Witness said  Seleucus  I could resign even my  Stratonice  to save my  Antiochus  At this the Tears ran down his Cheeks which when the Physician saw taking him by the Hand Sir says he If these are your real Sentiments the Prince's Life is out of Danger it is  Stratonice  for whom he dies  Seleucus  immediately gave Orders for fo∣lemnizing the Marriage and the young Queen to show her Obedience very generously exchan∣ged the Father for the Son  The TATLER N  o    Emitur sola Virtute Potestas  Claud  From  Thursday June  to  Saturday June    SheerLane  June  AS it has been the Endeavour of these our Labours to extirpate from among the polite or busy Part of Mankind all such as are either prejudicial or insignificant to Society so it ought to be no less our Study to supply the Havock we have made by an exact Care of the growing Ge∣neration But when we begin to inculcate pro∣per Precepts to the Children of this Island except we could take them out of their Nurses Arms we see an Amendment is almost impracticable for we find the whole Species of our Youth and grown Men is incorrigibly prepossessed with Va∣nity Pride or Ambition according to the re∣spective Pursuits to which they turn themselves By which Means the World is infatuated with the Love of Appearance instead of Things Thus the vain Man takes Praise for Honour the proud Man Ceremony for Respect the ambitious Man Power for Glory These three Characters are in∣deed of very near Resemblance but differently received by Mankind Vanity makes Men ridi∣culous Pride odious and Ambition terrible The Foundation of all which is That they are grounded upon Falshood For if Men instead of studying to appear considerable were in their own Hearts Possessors of the Requisites for Esteem the Acceptance they otherwise unfortunately aim at would be as inseparable from them as Appro∣bation  is from Truth it self By this Means they would have some Rule to walk by and they may ever be assured that a good Cause of Action will certainly receive a suitable Effect It may be an useful Hint in such Cases for a Man to ask of himself Whether he really is what he has a Mind to be thought If he is he need not give himself much further Anxiety What will the World say is the common Question in Matters of Dif∣ficulty as if the Terror lay wholly in the Sense which others and not we our selves shall have of our Actions From this one Source arise all the Impostors in every Art and Profession in all Pla∣ces among all Persons in Conversation as well as in Business Hence it is that a vain Fellow takes twice as much Pains to be ridiculous as would make him sincerely agreeable  Can any one be better fashioned better bred or has any one more good Nature than  Damasip∣pus  But the whole Scope of his Looks and Acti∣ons tends so immediately to gain the good Opi∣nion of all he converses with that he loses it for that only Reason As it is the Nature of Vanity to impose false Shews for Truths so does it also turn Real Possessions into Imaginary Ones  Da∣masippus  by assuming to himself what he has not robs himself of what he has  There is nothing more necessary to establish Reputation than to suspend the Enjoyment of it He that cannot bear the Sense of Merit with Si∣lence must of Necessity destroy it For Fame being the general Mistress of Mankind whoever gives it to himself insults all to whom he relates any Circumstances to his own Advantage He is considered as an open Ravisher of that Beauty for whom all others pine in Silence But some Minds are so incapable of any Temperance in this Particular that on every Second in their Dis∣course you may observe an Earnestness in their Eyes which shows they wait for your Approba∣tion  and perhaps the next Instant cast an Eye on a Glass to see how they like themselves Walk∣ing the other Day in a neighbouring Inn of Court I saw a more happy and more graceful Orator than I ever before had heard or read of A Youth of about Nineteen Years of Age was in an  In∣dian  NightGown and LacedCap  pleading a Cause before a Glass The young Fellow had a very good Air and seemed to hold his Brief in his Hand rather to help his Action than that he wanted Notes for his further Information When I first began to observe him I feared he would soon be alarmed but he was so zealous for his Client and so favourably received by the Court that he went on with great Fluency to inform the Bench That he humbly hoped they would not let the Merit of the Cause suffer by the Youth and Inexperience of the Pleader that in all Things he submitted to their Candour and modestly desi∣red they would not conclude but that Strength of Argument and Force of Reason may be con∣sistent with Grace of Action and Comeliness of Person  To me who see People every Day in the midst of Crowds whomsoever they seem to address to talk only to themselves and of themselves this Orator was not so extravagant a Man as perhaps another would have thought him but I took Part in his Success and was very glad to find he had in his Favour Judgment and Costs without any Manner of Opposition  The Effects of Pride and Vanity are of Conse∣quence only to the Proud and the Vain and tend to no further Ill than what is Personal to them∣selves in preventing their Progress in any Thing that is worthy and laudable and creating Envy instead of Emulation of superior Virtue These ill Qualities are to be found only in such as have so little Minds as to circumscribe their Thoughts and Designs within what properly relates to the  Value which they think due to their dear and amiable selves But Ambition which is the Third great Impediment to Honour and Virtue is a Fault of such as think themselves born for moving in an higher Orb and prefer being Powerful and Mischievous to being Virtuous and Obscure The Parent of this Mischief in Life so far as to regu∣late it into Schemes and make it possess a Man's whole Heart without his believing himself a Dae∣mon was  Machiavil  He first taught That a Man must necessarily appear weak to be honest Hence it gains upon the Imagination that a great is not so despicable as a little Villain and Men are in∣sensibly led to a Belief that the Aggravation of Crimes is the Diminution of them Hence the Impiety of thinking one Thing and speaking ano∣ther In Pursuance of this empty and unsatisfy∣ing Dream to betray to undermine to kill in themselves all natural Sentiments of Love to Friends or Country is the willing Practice of such as are thirsty of Power for any other Reason than that of being useful and acceptable to Mankind  ADVERTISEMENT  Whereas Mr  Bickerstaff  has lately received a Let∣ter out of  Ireland  dated  June  importing That he is

lie under a Kind of intellectual Rusticity Th  trifling Occasion made me run over in my Ima¦gination the many Scenes I have observed of th  married Condition wherein the Quintessence  Pleasure and

their whole Lives But when we consider the more informed Part of Mankind and look upon their Behaviour it then appears that very little of their Time is indiffe∣rent but generally spent in the most anxious Vexation or the highest Satisfaction  Shakespear  has admirably represented both the Aspects of this State in the most excellent Tragedy of  Othello  In the Character of  Desdemona  he runs through all the Sentiments of a virtuous Maid and a tender Wife She is captivated by his Virtue and faith∣ful to him as well from that Motive as Regard to her own Honour  Othello  is a great and noble Spirit misled by the Villany of a false Friend to suspect her Innocence and resents it accordingly When after the many Instances of Passion the Wife is told her Husband is jealous her Simpli∣city makes her incapable of believing it and say after such Circumstances as would drive another Woman into Distraction  I think the Sun where he was born  Drew all such Humours from him  This Opinion of him is so just that his noble and tender Heart beats it self to Pieces before he can affront her with the Mention of his Jealousy and owns this Suspicion has blotted out all the Sense of Glory and Happiness which before it was possessed with when he laments himself in the warm Allusions of a Mind accustomed to Enter∣tainments so very different from the Pangs of Jea∣lousy and Revenge How moving is his Sorrow when he cries out as follows  I had been happy if the general Camp  Pioneers and all  ad tasted her sweet Body  So I had nothing known Oh now for ever  Farewel the tranquil Mind Farewel Content  Farewel the plumed Troops and the big Wars  That make Ambition Virtue Oh Farewel  Farewel the neighing Steed and the shrill Trump  The Spiritstirring Drum th' Earpiercing Fife  The Royal

Curiosity to observe how  Wilks  and  Cibber  touch those Places where  Betterton  and  Sandford  so very highly ex∣celled But now I am got into a Discourse o  Acting with which I am so professedly pleased  I shall conclude this Paper with a Note I have ju  received from the Two ingenious Friends Mr  Pen∣kethman  and Mr  Bullock  SIR  FInding by your Paper N  o  that you a  drawing Parallels between the greate  Actors of the Age as you have already begu  with Mr  Wilks  and Mr  Cibber  we desire yo  would do the same Justice to your humble Ser¦vants  William Bullock  and  William Penkethman  For the Information of Posterity I shall com¦ply with this Letter and set these Two great Me  in such a Light as  Sallust  has placed his  Cato  an  Caesar  Mr  William Bullock  and Mr  William Penketh¦man  are of the same Age Profession and Se  They both distinguish themselves in a very parti¦cular Manner under the Discipline of the CrabTree  with this only Difference That Mr  Bullock  has the most agreeable Squawl and Mr  Penketh∣man  the more graceful Shrug  Penkethman  de∣vours a cold Chick with great Applause  Bul∣lock  's Talent lies chiefly in Sparagrass  Penketh∣man  is very dext'rous at conveying himself under a Table  Bullock  is no less active at jumping over a Stick Mr  Penkethman  has a great deal of Mo∣ney but Mr  Bullock  is the taller Man  The TATLER N  o    Est in Juvencis est in Equis Patrum  Virtus nec imbellem feroces  Progenerant Aquilae Columbam  Hor  From  Thursday June  to  Saturday June    From my own Apartment  June  HAving lately turned my Thoughts upon the Consideration of the Behaviour of Parents to Children in the great Affair of Marriage I took much Delight in turning over a Bundle of Let∣ters which a Gentleman's Steward in the Country had sent me some Time ago This Parcel is a Collection of Letters written by the Children of the Family to which he belongs to their Fa∣ther and contain all the little Passages of their Lives and the new Idea's they received as their Years advanced There is in them an Account of their Diversions as well as their Exercises and what I thought very remarkable is That Two Sons of the Family who now make considerable Figures in the World gave Omens of that Sort of Character which they now bear in the first Ru∣diments of Thought which they show in their  Letters Were one to point out a Method of Edu∣cation one could not methinks frame one more pleasing or improving than this where the Children get an Habit of communicating their Thoughts and Inclinations to their best Friend with so much Freedom that he can form Schemes for their future Life and Conduct from an Ob∣servation of their Tempers and by that Means be early enough in chusing their Way of Life to make them forward in some Art or Science at an Age when others have not determined what Pro∣fession to follow As to the Persons concerned in this Packet I am speaking of they have given great Proofs of the Force of this Conduct of their Fa∣ther in the Effect it has had upon their Lives and Manners The elder who is a Scholar showed from his Infancy a Propensity to polite Studies and has made a suitable Progress in Literature but his Learning is so well woven into his Mind that from the Impressions of it he seems rather to have contracted an Habit of Life than Manner of Discourse To his Books he seems to owe a good Oeconomy in his Affairs and a Compla∣cency in his Manners though in others that Way of Education has commonly a quite different Ef∣fect The Epistles of the other Son are full of Accounts of what he thought most remarkable in his Reading He sends his Father for News the  ast noble Story he had read I observe he is particularly touched with the Conduct of  Codrus  who plotted his own Death because the Oracle had said If he were not killed the Enemy should prevail over his Country Many other Incidents in his little Letters give Omens of a Soul capable of generous Undertakings and what makes it the more particular is That this Gentleman had in the present War the Honour and Happiness of doing an Action for which only it was worth coming into the World Their Father is the most intimate Friend they have and they always con∣sult  him rather than any other when any Error has happened in their Conduct through Youth and Inadvertency The Behaviour of this Gentle∣man to his Sons has made his Life pass away with the Pleasures of a second Youth for as the Vexations which Men receive from their Children hasten the Approach of Age and double the Force of Years so the Comforts which they reap from them are Balm to all other Sorrows and disap∣point the Injuries of Time Parents of Children repeat their Lives in their Offspring and their Concern for them is so near that they feel all their Sufferings and Enjoyments as much as if they re∣garded their own proper Persons But it is gene∣rally so far otherwise that the common Race of 'Squires in this Kingdom use their Sons as Per∣sons that are waiting only for their Funerals and Spies upon their Health and Happiness as in∣deed they are by their own making them such In Cases where a Man takes the Liberty after this Manner to reprehend others it is commonly said Let him look at Home I am sorry to own it but there is one Branch of the House of the  Bicker∣staffs  who have been as erroneous in their Con∣duct this Way as any other Family whatsoever The Head of this Branch is now in Town and has brought up with him his Son and Daughter who are all the Children he has in order to be put some Way into the World and see Fashions They are both very illbred Cubs and having li∣ved together from their Infancy without Know∣ledge of the Distinctions and Decencies that are proper to be paid to each other's Sex they squab∣ble like two Brothers The Father is one of those who knows no better than that all Pleasure is De∣bauchery and imagines when he sees a Man become his Estate that he will certainly spend it This Branch are a People who never had among them one Man eminent either for Good or Ill however have all along kept their Heads just  above Water not by a prudent and regular Oeco∣nomy but by Expedients in the Matches they have made into their House When one of the Family has in the Pursuit of Foxes and in the Entertainment of Clowns ran out the Third Part of the Value of his Estate such a Spendthrist has dressed up his eldest Son and married what they call a Good Fortune who has supported the Fa∣ther as a Tyrant over them during his Life in the same House or Neighbourhood The Son in Succession has just taken the same Method to keep up his Dignity till the Mortgages he has eat and drank himself into have reduced him to the Ne∣cessity of sacrificing his Son also in Imitation of his Progenitor This had been for many Genera∣tions the whole that had happened in the Family of  Sam Bickerstaff  till the Time of my present Cousin  Samuel  the Father of the young People we have just now spoken of  Samuel Bickerstaff  Esq  is so happy as that by several Legacies from distant Relations Deaths of Maiden Sisters and other Instances of good Fortune he has besides his real Estate a great Sum of ready Money His Son at the same Time knows he has a good Fortune which the Father cannot alienate though he strives to make him believe he depends only on his Will for Main∣tenance  Tom  is now in his Nineteenth Year Mrs  Mary  in her Fifteenth Cousin  Samuel  who understands no one Point of good Behaviour as it regards all the rest of the World is an exact Cri∣tick in the Dress the Motion the Looks and Gestures of his Children What adds to their Misery is That he is excessively fond of them and the greatest Part of their Time is spent in the Presence of this nice Observer Their Life is one continued Constraint The Girl never turns her Head but she is warned not to follow the proud Minxes of the Town The Boy is not to turn Fop or be quarrelsom at the same Time not to  take an Affront I had the good Fortune to dine with him to day and heard his fatherly TableTalk as we sat at Dinner which if my Memory does not fail me for the Benefit of the World I shall set down as he spoke it which was much as follows and may be of great Use to those Pa∣rents who seem to make it a Rule That their Children's Turn to enjoy the World is not to com∣mence till they themselves have left it  Now  Tom  I have bought you Chambers in the Inns of Court I allow you to take a Walk once or twice a Day round the Garden If you mind your Business you need not study to be as great a Lawyer as  Cook  upon  Littleton  I have that that will keep you but be sure you keep an exact Account of your Linen Write down what you give out to your Land∣ress and what she brings Home again Go as little as possible to t'other End of the Town but if you do come Home early I believe I was as sharp as you for your Ears and I had my Hat snatched off my Head coming Home late at a Stop by St  Clement  's Church and I don't know from that Day to this who took it I do not care if you learn to fence a lit∣tle for I would not have you be made a Fool of Let me have an Account of every Thing every Post I am willing to be at that Charge and I think you need not spare your Pains As for you Daughter  Molly  don't mind one Word that is said to you in  London  for it is only for your Money  The End of the
