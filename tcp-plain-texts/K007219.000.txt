FARQUHAR  CollegeGreen  MDCCXCIII  ADVERTISEMENT  As certain Dramatic Writers postpone the Publication of their Pieces intimidated by every mean mercenary Momus of the day called a Critic the Printer for the present thus presumes to present the Public with corrected Copies of such Plays as having passed the Theatrical Odeal have so long been confined to the bare Representation  Nor does he by this accommodation mean to injure the Authors but rather would prepare the way for their approach to the Temple of Fame For their encouragement He assures such Candidates that the howling sons of Cerberus are easily soothed by a  sop  and that the music of  money  will readily lull the most watchful descendant of  Argus  Several of the Printer's Cotemporaries having forced into the world depraved and mutilated Copies of the Unpublished Plays he has fallen upon an expedient of procuring them as Correct as they stand on the Prompter's Book and represented at the Royal Theatres With regard to the following  Opera  he only observes that others with him have "run in the race to entertain the Public but he alone has obtained the PRIZE"  DRAMATIS PERSONAE  LENITIVE  Mr Bannister Jun  LABEL  Mr
