NO I will not attempt to console my Louisa for I will not suppose even at the present moment that she yields to grief or is in need of consolation She will not repine at what is not to be remedied nor debilitate her mind by dwelling  on her own causes of discontent instead of awakening it to the numerous sources of happiness which by increasing the happiness of others incite it to activity These are truths too deeply engraven on the heart of Louisa to be forgotten and it is scarcely necessary to revive them even at this serious moment  With respect to myself my friend shall be my judge my whole conduct shall be submitted to her with an injunction not to indulge any partialities in my favour but to censure advise and instruct me whenever she finds opportunity Such Louisa has been our intercourse and we have mutual reason to congratulate each other on its effects  I have just had a conversation with  Sir Arthur He has received a letter from Abimelech which he shewed me Of all the proofs Frank has yet given of energy this relative to his father is perhaps the strongest You know the character of Abimelech Could you think it possible He is willing not only to raise twenty thousand pounds for Sir Arthur but to pay down thirty more for his son He begins to be vain of this son and has even some slight perception that there may be other good qualities beside that of getting and hoarding money  But his cunning is still predominant Having conceived the possibility of this marriage the accomplishment of it is now become his ruling passion and has for a moment subjected avarice itself  He neglects no motive which he thinks may influence Sir Arthur not even threatening though his language is couched in all the art of apparent kindness and adulation His letter however has produced its effect on my father as you will perceive by the following dialogue which was begun by Sir Arthur  What think you of this proposal Anna  I ought rather to ask what are your thoughts on the subject sir  I can scarcely tell I own it does not seem to me quite so unreasonable as I should once have supposed it that is as far as relates to me But if you should have conceived any partiality for Mr Clifton I should then  Excuse me sir for interrupting you but Mr Clifton is at present wholly out of the question Were it in my power which I fear it is not to do him any service I should be as desirous of doing it now as ever but I can never more think of him as a husband  Are you so very determined  I am and I hope sir my determination is not offensive to you  I cannot say at present that it is for not to mention that I think very well of young Mr Henley I own the affair of the anonymous letter was a very improper and strange proceeding Your aunt Wenbourne and Lord FitzAllen indeed seem to doubt it but according to the account which you and Mr Henley  give I think they have no foundation for their doubts  The behaviour of Mr Clifton without the letter would have been quite sufficient to have fixed my determination  What behaviour  The proof he gave of deceit and depravity of principle by the manner in which he endeavoured to seduce me  When was that  The very day on which Frank arrived  Endeavoured to seduce you  Yes  Are you certain of the truth of what you say  He proceeded too far and explained himself too openly for me to be mistaken  Seduce youThen you have entirely given up all thoughts of him  All thoughts of marrying him I have most certainly  And what is your opinion of Mr Henley  What can it be sir Are there two opinions concerning him And if I were blind to his virtues for whose safety he has been so often and so ardently active who should do him justice  I own Anna I have often thought you had some love for him and I am tempted to think so still  Love in the sense in which you understand it I have carefully suppressed because till now I supposed it incompatible with duty and virtue but I acknowledge I begin to doubt and even  to suppose that his view of the subject has been more rational and true than mine and he thinks it is our duty to form a union for which he owns he has an ardent wish  Yes he has honestly told me all that passed between you and his sincerity pleased meBut every branch of our family would certainly be against such a match  I suppose so  The world too would consider me as having dishonoured myself were I to consent  I believe it would  And would exclaim against the bad exampleWhat ought to be done  My opinion has been that the world would have cause to make this complaint  but I now think or rather imagine myself convinced that I was in an error It appears evident to my mind at present that we ought to consider whether an action be in itself good or bad just or unjust and totally to disregard both our own prejudices and the prejudices of the world Were I to pay false homage to wealth and rank because the world tells me it is right that I should do so and to neglect genius and virtue which my judgment tells me would be an odious wrong I should find but little satisfaction in the applause of the world opposed to selfcondemnation  Mr Henley is a very good young man a very good young man indeed and I believe I should even be willing to  think of him for a son if it should not be opposed by the other branches of the family  But that it surely will  I am afraid soLord FitzAllen is half reconciled to us again and I would avoid breaking with him if possible Your aunt has a good opinion of Mr Henley  But a better of Mr Clifton  Yes so I suppose I must talk to Edward Mr Henley has been his friend  But Edward does not understand friendship When he says friend he means acquaintance and he finds him the most agreeable acquaintance who tells him least truth which certainly is not Mr Henley I have observed him  lately to be rather fond of the company of Mr Clifton whom he thinks a better companion  I own Mr Henley is very obstinate in his opinions  If his opinions be true would you not have him persist in the truth  But why should he be more certain that what he says is truth than other people  Because he has examined with more industry and caution has a stronger mind and a greater love of enquiry He does not endeavour to make his principles accord with his practice but regulates his practice by his principles  But still I ask what proof he has of being more in the right than other people  I wonder sir that you can put such a question He has surely given both you and me sufficient proofs of superiority and though you should doubt the arguments you cannot doubt the facts  I own he is a very extraordinary young gentleman  Ah sir The word gentleman shews the bent of your thoughts Can you not perceive it is a word without a meaning Or if it have a meaning that he who is the best man is the most a gentleman  I know your notions child and mine differ a little on these matters However I do not think you quite so much in the wrong as I used to do and perhaps there is something in what you say Many men of low fortunes have made their way to the highest honours and  for what I know he may do the same  He may and certainly will deserve the highest respect but if you flatter yourself sir that he will seek or accept the titles and distinctions which men have invented to impose on each other's folly and obtain their own artful purposes I ought to warn you that you will be mistaken His whole life will be devoted to the discovery and spreading of truth and individual acts of benevolence excepted his wealth should he acquire any will all be dedicated to that sole object  I am afraid these are strange whims Anna  I hope yet to shew you sir they are  noble duties which it is the excess of guilt to neglect  It puzzles me to conceive by what means his father could have become so rich  He has all his life been rapacious after money His faculties are strong but perverted What would have been wisdom is degenerated into cunning He has made himself acquainted with usurers and they have made him acquainted with spendthrifts He has traded in annuities and profited by the eagerness of youth to enjoy and since I must be sincere he has encouraged you sir to pursue plans of expence with a view solely to his own profit  Well well should this marriage  take place it will all return into the family  That should be no motive sir with either you or me  I do not know that You understand your own reasons and I mine and if they should but answer the same end there will be no harm  I was going to reply but Sir Arthur left me being unwilling to hear arguments which he took it for granted he should not understand  Frank came in soon after and I repeated to him what had been said Louisa I must tell you the truth and the whole truth Since I have begun to imagine I might indulge my thoughts in dwelling on▪his exalted qualities and uncommon  virtues my affection for them has greatly increased and they never appeared to me more lovely than in the struggles and checks which his joy received at the hope of our union by the recollection of the loss of Mr Clifton He like me is astonished at the powers of your brother's mind and at their perversion and he fears that this attempt having failed will but serve to render that perversion more obdurate nay perhaps more active He seems even to dread lest I am not secure which his desire to guard and caution me against would not suffer him to repress or conceal His tenderness and ecstasy and indeed Louisa they were both very strong were mingled with regret equally  vivid and Mr Clifton Mr Clifton repeatedly burst from him  While I was relating what had passed between me and Sir Arthur to Frank and now again since I have been writing it to you I accused myself of coldness and of shrinking from or rather of half delivering the truth lest Sir Arthur should think me a forward girl or lest I should think myself capable of too sudden a change But of the degree of that change do you my friend judge I have at all times endeavoured to shew you my naked heart and often have violently struggled against every disguise I never concealed from myself that I thought more highly of Frank Henley than of Mr Clifton but I imagined principle taught me to prefer what principle  now warns me to shun I am more and more convinced of the error of marrying a bad man in order to make him good I was not entirely ignorant of this before and therefore flattered myself the good might be effected previous to marriage I forgot when passion has a purpose to obtain how artful it is in concealment  I have another quarrel with myself for having been so desirous of proving to my own conviction that the world's prejudices and the prejudices of my family ought to be respected while that opinion accorded with my practice and of being now so equally alert to prove the reverse Such are the deceptions which the mind puts upon itself For indeed I have been very desirous of acting with  sincerity in both instances I can only say that I feel more certain at present for before I had doubts and now I have none If you suspect me to be influenced by inclination tell me so without reserve  All good be with my friend May she profit by my mistakes  A W ST IVES  LETTER CI  COKE CLIFTON TO GUY FAIRFAX  RoseBank  YOU will perceive Fairfax I have changed the scene and am now in the country I have a long narrative to detail and am sitting in an old hall with gloom and leisure enough to make it as tedious and as dull as you could wish My poor mother has taken her last  leave of us and lies now a corpse in the room under me I could be melancholy or mad or I know not whatBut 'tis no matterShe brought me here unasked to make the journey of this world and now I am obliged to jog on Not that I think I should much care if it were shortened nor how soon except that I would live to have my revenge and that I will have little troubling myself though the next minute were certain to be my last It rankles at my heart and lies there corroding biting festering night and day  I have quarrelled with my sister and I am sure shall never forgive her nor will she forgive me so that we shall easily balance our accounts This Anna St Ives is her supreme favourite But  no wonderNo wonderIt would be strange if she were not Still to be so ready to give up a brother and write me such a letter as she did on the death of my mother If I do not make her repent it Heaven renounce me  But I consider the whole world as my enemies at this moment you perhaps Fairfax excepted I say perhaps for I do not know how soon you may turn upon and yelp at me with the rest  Forgive me Fairfax I am all venom all viper and cannot forbear to hiss even at my friend But let my enemies beware They shall find I can stingThese cursed gnawings of heart will not let me begin my story  I told you I was determined to deny the anonymous letter I have been very industrious with uncle FitzAllen and aunt Wenbourne and have been equally careful to titilate the vanity of the coxcomb Edward who is highly flattered with the attention I have paid him and will I am certain become my warm partisan  They had all heard the story but were all ready enough to gape and swallow my tale which considering it was wholly invention was not ill composed I begin to hate myself to hate her to hate the whole world for being obliged to submit to such a damned expedient But I will not recede I will  have my revenge Were the devil himself waiting to devour me I would on or were he engaged against me I would overreach him  I concerted my measures and learning that this lad of mine who wrote the letter for me was down at WenbourneHill I sent my man to inveigle him to come to me at an inn where I purposely stopped in my way to RoseBank How durst they suborn my servantBut I will stab and not curse  My valet executed his commission and prevailed on the lad to come though with some difficulty for he is a stubborn dog and had not the valet followed my directions and told him it was to do his old master a service he would have been foiled But I took  him up at Paris destitute and in some danger of starving which he has not forgotten  This Henley however is a greater favourite with him than I am as I soon found by his discourse  I began by sounding him to try if it were possible to prevail on him to assert he had written the letter at the instigation of Henley instead of me but I soon found it was in vain and durst not proceed to let him see my drift  I then persuaded him that they had totally mistaken my purpose in writing the letter that I had done it with a very friendly design that I had myself a very great esteem for Henley and that I meant nothing but good to Anna but that there were some reasons which I  could not explain to him that had occasioned me to write the letter  As my next purpose after that of making him an evidence in my favour was to send him entirely out of the way if I failed in the first attempt I began to remind him of the condition in which I had found him in Paris which he was ready enough to acknowledge and seemed indeed afraid of acting ungratefully I prompted and strengthened his fears and at last told him that since I found he was a good lad and meant well though he was mistaken and had done me an injury I would give him an opportunity of shewing his gratitude  I then pretended that I had a packet of the utmost consequence to be delivered to my friend in Paris meaning  you Fairfax which I durst not trust to any but a sure hand and as I knew him to be an honest lad I expected he would not refuse to set off with it immediately It was an affair almost of life and death And that I might impress his mind with ideas which would associate and beget suitable images I began to talk of the decease of my mother of my own affliction at the misunderstanding with Anna of my very great friendship for Henley and of the fatal consequences that would attend the miscarriage of the packet  Still I found him reluctant He seemed half to suspect me and yet I made a very clever tale of it He talked of Henley and his aunt and he had likewise a dread of Paris His aunt I find has  been maintained by Henley she being lame and disabled and as sending him out of the way was a preliminary step absolutely necessary I gave him a thirty pound banknote desired him to go to his aunt and give her ten pounds and to keep the rest to secure him against any accidents of which he seemed afraid in a strange country with a promise that he should have as much more if he performed his commission faithfully on his return  I further enquired the direction of the aunt telling him I would undertake to provide for her and so I must for she too must be sent out of the way  At last by repeating my professions and again reminding him of my taking him up at Paris I was successful  Though I had more trouble in gaining the compliance of this lout than would have been sufficient were I prime minister and did I bribe with any thing like the same comparative liberality to gain ten worthy members of parliament though five knights of the shire had been of the number  He wanted to return to WenbourneHill for his necessaries and trifling property and this reminded me not only of the danger of doing that but of his passing through London Accordingly I told him to keep the ten pounds meant for his aunt to buy himself what things he wanted which I promised to replace to her and informed him I now recollected that he must take the nearest road to Dover which I pretended lay through  Guildford Bletchingly and Tunbridge leaving London on the left  The importance hurry and command I assumed did not give him time to reflect and the injunctions I gave were such as I do not imagine he would have disobeyed But for my own security pretending a fear that he might mistake his way I sent my valet with him privately ordering the valet not to part till he saw him safe on board the packetboat  And now Fairfax it is not impossible but the wise uncle who has an excellent scent at discovery and no small opinion of his own acuteness may find out that Henley himself was the forger of this letter that it was a collusion between him and the lad that he has himself removed  moved both the lad and the aunt and that his charity is a farce I say such an event is possible You may be sure that the idea shall be wholly his own and that I will allow him all the just praise which he will graciously bestow upon his penetration  My directions to the lad w ere to bring the packet immediately to you which packet you will find to be blank paper for I had no time for any thing more except a short note of which the following is a copy  AN event which I have not leisure to relate occasions me to send you this by a special messenger You will most probably receive a letter express  from me before he arrives but if not detain him carefully Hint not a word of the matter but make a pretext of urgent business concerning me for the issue of which he must wait At all events do not let him escape till you hear further from  C CLIFTON  I was obliged to pretend extreme hurry to the lad but I gave my valet private instructions to take him round and use as much delay as he conveniently could Meanwhile I will send the letter I am now writing away express that you may be fully prepared for this is a point of infinite consequence If you are not in Paris the express is to  follow you and you will be kind enough to take measures that the lad may follow the express He is ordered to wait your commands which I told him might possibly detain him a month or even more though it might happen that the business would be transacted in a week  Not that I can hope the real business can now possibly be so soon finished  You will take care to make your account agree with mine and circumstances oblige me to require of you Fairfax to condescend to get the lad's favour and not make his stay irksome You may command me to ten times this amount as you know  This is a melancholy scene and a  gloomy house and a dismal country and I myself am fretful and moody and mad and miserable I shall soon get into action and then it will wear off  I will have her ay by the infernals will I And on my own terms I know she is rejoicing now in her Henley Eternal curses bite him But I will haunt her I will appear to her in her dreams and her waking hours shall not want a glimpse of me I know she hates me So be it If she did not I could not so readily digest my vengeance But I know she does And she shall have better cause I never yet submitted to be thus baffled She is preparing an imaginary banquet and I  will be there a real guest I will meet her at Philippi  I wish I were away from this place I wish I were in my mother's coffin  I hate to meet this insolent sister of mine We have had a battle and I was in such a frantic rage that I could neither find ideas nor words while she was cool cutting insolent impudent I never in my life had so strong an inclination to wring a hussey's neck round  But I will get away as fast as I can I am resolved however to turn her out of the house first She shall feel me too before I have done Brother with her is no tie nor shall sister be to me Her mother has made but a small provision  for her and has recommended her to my mercy She had better have taught her a little humility  Plagues and pestilence Why do I worry myself about her I have quite causes enough of distraction without that I must not turn her out of doors neither now I remember If I did she would fly to her friend and would make her if possible as great a fury as herself  Why do I say would make Do I not know that I am her abhorrence I loved her Fairfax better than ever I loved woman and would have loved her more have loved her entirely infinitely heart and soul if she had not wronged me From the first I was overlooked by her catechised reprimanded  treated like a poor ignoramus while her Henley If I write any more I shall go madDash through the window or do some desperate act  C CLIFTON  LETTER CII  SIR ARTHUR ST IVES TO ABIMELECH HENLEY  London Grosvenor Street  MR HENLEY  SIR I have received your letter which I must acknowledge is far more satisfactory and in a more proper style than your last at which I cannot but own I was exceedingly surprised  With respect to your son I must say  that he is a young gentleman of very great merit and though a marriage into the family of St Ives is a thing that he certainly has no right to expect yet I cannot deny that your proposal deserves some consideration inasmuch as you now come forward like a man and have likewise a recollection of propriety  Neither do I forget good sir what you have hinted concerning WenbourneHill which is far from disagreeable to me And though there are many impediments for which I cannot altogether answer just at present yet I think it very probable that this affair should end in something like the manner you desire I accordingly expect Mr Henley you  will have the kindness to stop proceedings relative to the foreclosures  In return for which I assure you on my honour I will do every thing that becomes a gentleman to bring the affair to a proper conclusion And as I have a very great respect for your son and think very highly of his parts and learning and all that I find when things come to be considered that he perhaps may make my daughter more happy and the match may have other greater conveniences than perhaps one that might seem to the other branches of my family more suitable  But I know that for the present it will be opposed by Lord FitzAllen and though I do not think proper to  be governed by him or any man yet I could rather wish not to come to an open rupture with so near a relation  It will perhaps be thought derogatory by some other branches of the family But my daughter has a very high opinion of the good qualities of your son and she reminds me continually that he has done us many signal services which I assure you Mr Henley I am very willing to remember  When things shall be in a proper train I imagine it will be our best way of proceeding to pay off all mortgages on WenbourneHill together with the sum for the docking of the entail to my son Edward and  to settle the estate in reversion on our children and their issue my rental being made subject to the payment of legal interest to your son for the fifty thousand pounds But we will consider further on these things when matters are ripe  In the mean time be pleased to send me up one thousand pounds for present current expences which you will place to account And now I hope good sir we shall from this time be upon proper terms in expectation of which I remain with all friendly intentions  A ST IVES  LETTER CIII  ANNA WENBOURNE ST IVES TO LOUISA CLIFTON  London GrosvenorStreet  OH that I could write to my Louisa as formerly with flattering and generous hopes in favour of a brother Would it were possible I am already weary of accusation though I fear this is but its beginning I cannot help it but I have strong apprehensions Not  that I will be the slave of fear or sink before danger should it happen to come  The lad that copied the anonymous letter has left WenbourneHill Is run away No one knows whither He went the very day on which your brother left London to be present with you at Mrs Clifton's funeral and Clifton now denies with pretended indignation having had any knowledge whatever of this letterOh how audacious is he in error Had the same energy but a worthy object how excellent would be its effects  It is a strange circumstance And what is more strange and indeed alarming Frank has been to enquire for the lad's aunt and she is gone No one  can tell what is become of her except that she went away in a hackneycoach after having as the people suppose received a present because she discharged all her little debts contracted during the absence of Frank and bought herself some necessaries  What can this sudden and unaccountable removal of these two people mean They had both apparently the strongest motives to the contrary and Frank has a very good opinion of the lad and not a bad one of the aunt  This is not all We were yesterday invited to dine with Lord FitzAllen that is I and Sir Arthur not Frank Henley as you will suppose I had a dislike to the visit though I did not  suspect it would have been half so disagreeable My brother and my aunt Wenbourne were likewise invited we found them there  Ever since the scene with Mr Clifton I have been constantly denied to him and positively refused all his applications for an interview conceiving it to be just not to let him imagine there was any doubt on my mind relative to his proceedings and their motives We had scarcely sat down to table before he came in as if by accident This was a subterfuge To what will not error and the abandonment of the passions submit  After apologies for dropping in and disturbing so much good company and a repetition ofI am very glad to see  you sir you do my table honour and other like marked compliments from Lord FitzAllen Clifton seated himself and endeavoured to assume his former gaiety and humour But it could not beHis heart was too ill at ease His eye was continually glancing toward me and there as often met that steady regard which he knew not how to support and by which he was as continually disconcerted I did not affect to frown and to smile would have been guilt I put no reproof into my look except the openeyed sobriety of fortitude springing from a consciousness of right But this was insupportable He talked fast for he wanted to talk away his sensations as well as to convince his observers that he was quite at his ease I know not  how far he was successful for they laughed as much when he failed or more perhaps than they would have done had his wit preserved its usual brilliancy His manner told them he intended to be jocular and that was their cue to join chorus  Lord FitzAllen was very marked in his attentions to him which were returned with no less ardour Clifton indeed evidently laid himself out to please the whole table but me least because with me he had least hope and because he found his efforts produced no alteration in that uniform seriousness on which I had determined  As soon as the dessert was served up the servants withdrew and not one of them afterward came in till rung for  which I imagine had been preconcerted Looks then became more grave and the conversation soon dwindled into silence At last Lord FitzAllen after various hems and efforts for he has some fear of me or rather of what he supposes the derogatory sufferance of contradiction addressed himself to me  I am sorry to hear niece there is a misunderstanding between you and Mr Clifton and as you happen now to be both together I think it is a proper opportunity for explanation You know Miss St Ives that an alliance with the family of Clifton has always met my approbation and I suppose you will not deny me the favour of listening with patienceWhy don't you speak niece  You desired me to listen sir and I am silentLet Mr Clifton proceed  Clifton after some stammering hesitation beganI know madam you have been prejudiced against me and have been told very strange things very unaccountable things I cannot tell what answer to make till I know perfectly of what I am accused All I request is to be suffered to face my accusers and let Lord FitzAllen or Sir Arthur or this good lady My aunt Wenbourne or your brother nay or yourself though you think so ill of me be my judge I am told something of an anonymous letter I know not very well what but if any good evidence can be brought of my having written or caused to be written or had any concern whatever in  the writing of such a letter I solemnly pledge myself to renounce the blessing I so ardently seek without a murmur  Lord FitzAllen exclaimed nothing could be more gentlemanlike My aunt Wenbourne owned it was a very proper proposal Edward thought there could be no objection to it Sir Arthur was silent  His insidious appeal to justice and being brought face to face with his accusers revived the full picture of the flight of the lad the removal of the aunt and the whole chain of craft and falsehood connected with these circumstances It was with difficulty I repressed feelings that were struggling into indignationI addressed myself to Mr Clifton  Then sir you coolly and deliberately deny all knowledge of the letter in question  I have told you madam that I will suffer Lord FitzAllen yourself any person to pass sentence after having examined witnesses  Answer me in an open direct manner Mr Clifton without ambiguity Were you not the author of that letter  I am sorry madam to see you so desirous to find me guilty and I would even criminate myself to give you pleasure but that I know I must then neither hope for your favour nor the countenance of this good company I assure you Lord FitzAllen I assure you Sir Arthur and you madam and all upon  my honour I am incapable of what is attributed to me  Do not appeal to my uncle and aunt Mr Clifton but turn this way Let your eyes be fixed here Listen while I read the letter and then without once shrinking from yourself or me repeat as you have done though in an equivocal manner upon your honour you are not the author  I took the letter from my pocket and began to read When I came to the following passage I again repeatedLook at me Mr Clifton  She will never have the man they mean for her I can assure you of that and what is more he will never have her  I proceeded to the end and then addedOnce more Mr Clifton look at  me and repeatUpon my honour I was not the inventor and author of those words  Louifa He did look I hope I never shall see man look so againHe stared and forced his eyes to do their office and repeated  Upon my honour I was not the inventor and author of those words  He stabbed me to the heart LouisaCan he do thisThen what can he not do He even felt a complacency at the victory he had obtained and turning round to Lord FitzAllen and the company again repeated  Upon my honour I am not the inventor and author of those words  Lord FitzAllen almost crowed with exultation I am mistaken niece said  he if you do not find there are other people who can write anonymous letters people of no honour upstarts mongrels mushrooms low contemptible fellows that would fully the mouth of a FitzAllen to mention  The tone of this lordly uncle was so high Louisa and his passions so arrogant loud and obstinate that it was with difficulty I could recover the fortitude requisite to assert truth and put falsehood to the blush I again turned to my opponent  Mr Clifton I feel at present you are a dangerous man But I do not fear you Observe sir I do not fear youI turned to my uncle Sir Mr Clifton caused this letter to be written But if there were no such letter in existence I  have another proof stronger more undeniable of which I imagine you will not doubt when I inform you that no third person was concerned It was addressed to myself It was a strenuous bold unprincipled effort to seduce me Let the gentleman again look me in the face and tell me I am guilty of falsehood  I spoke with firmness and Lord FitzAllen's features relaxed and his eye began to enquire with pain and apprehension His great fear was of being convicted of want of penetration Clifton perceived the feelings of the company turn upon him with suspicion but his art must I add his hypocrisy did not fail him He transformed the confusion he felt into a look of contrition and  with as much ardour as if it had been real replied  It is that fatal error which has ruined me madam in your good opinion and has occasioned you to credit every accusation against me however improbable I confess my guilt Not guilt of heart madam for honour be my witness my views were as pure as the words in which they were uttered I was at that time dependant on the will of a mother whom I loved and whose memory I revere My passions were impatient and I wished to remove impediments to my happiness which now no longer exist I do not pretend to palliate what is unpardonable and what I myself condemn as severely as you do except that I abjure all dishónourable intentions and  meant as I said to be your husband The strongest proof I can give that this was my meaning I now offer in the presence of this noble and good company I require no conditions I ask for no fortune except yourself which is the only blessing I covet in this life I will joyfully attend you to the altar whenever you and your worthy relations shall consent next week tomorrow today this moment and should think myself the most favoured the most happy man on earth  The offer is the offer of a gentleman Sir Arthur said Lord FitzAllen If Mr Clifton had been guilty of any indecorum niece Turning to me you could not require more honourable amends This is acting with that dignity  which characterizes a man of family Mrs Wenbourne and as it is impossible for Miss St Ives to see it in any other point of view here the affair will naturally end and there is no more to be said  I immediately answeredIf sir by the affair ending here you understand any further intercourse between me and Mr Clifton I must not suffer you to continue in such an error We are and ever must remain separate Habit and education have made us two such different beings that it would be the excess of folly to suppose marriage could make us one  Miss St IvesMy uncle collected all his ideas of rank and grandeur Miss St Ives you must do me the honour to  consider me as the head of our family and suffer me to remind you of the respect and obedience which are due to that head The proposal now made you I approve It is made by a man of family and I must take the liberty to lay my injunctions upon you to listen to it in a decorous and proper manner  I answeredI am sorry sir that our ideas of propriety are so very opposite But whether my judgment be right or wrong as I am the person to be married to Mr Clifton and not your Lordship my judgment as well as yours must and ought to be consulted  Lord FitzAllen could scarcely restrain his anger within the bounds of his own decorum He burst into exclamationsExceedingly well missVery  proper behaviour to a person of my rank and your uncleYou hear Sir ArthurYou hear Mrs Wenbourne You all hearBut your motives and inclinations are known miss I am sorry that it would dishonour the tongue of FitzAllen to repeat them and I cannot help telling you Sir Arthur that you have been exceedingly to blame to admit such a fellow to any familiarity with a woman of rank and my niece a fellow better entitled to be her footman than herI will not permit the word to pass my lips  I felt the cowardice of suffering worth and virtue to be insulted without a defender from the fear that I myself should be involved in the insult and replied  The gentleman sir to whom you have twice alluded in terms of so much contempt were he present would smile at your mistake But there are more people at this table than myself who have been witnesses how little he deserves to be spoken of in the language of opprobrium  Mr Clifton appeared eager to be the first to acknowledge Mr Henley was a very worthy person Edward muttered something to the same tune and Sir Arthur seemed very willing to have spoken out but wanted the courage He began at Turnham Green but could get no further Lord FitzAllen answered  What tell you me of TurnhamGreen Sir Arthur I was stopped once myself by a highwayman and my footman  fired at him and sent him packing but I did not for that reason come home and marry my footman to my daughter  The full image of Frank and his virtues pervaded my mind my heart swelled my thoughts burst from my lips and I exclaimedOh sir that you had a thousand daughters and that each of them were worthy of such a footman for a husband  Had you beheld this uncle of mine LouisaThe daughters of the peer FitzAllen married to footmen The insult was almost agony The only antidote to the pain which his countenance excited was the absurdity and ridicule of the prejudice But I perceived how vain it was to expect that in this company  the voice of justice should be heard and I rose My aunt rose at the same time to retire with me but recollecting myself I turned and thus addressed Lord FitzAllen and Mr Clifton alternately  That I may not be liable to any just blame from your lordship or you sir for want of being explicit you must permit me to repeatI never will again admit of the addresses of Mr Clifton I have an abhorrence of the errors in which he is now indulging He himself has told me what a mad and vicious act it would be to marry a husband in whom I could not confide and I never can confide in him My persuasion at this moment of his hypocrisy is such that could I prevail on myself to the debasement  of putting him to the trial by pretending to accept his hand I am convinced he would refuse I read his heart He seeks an opportunity to revenge imaginary injuries for I never did do not nor ever can wish him any thing but good I think I would lay down my life without hesitation to render him all of which his uncommon powers are capable but I perceive the impossibility of its being effected by me and I here ultimately and determinedly renounce all thought of him or of so dangerous an attempt  Mr Clifton eagerly started up and with a momentary softening of countenance a pleading voice and something like the tone of returning virtue exclaimedHear me madamI conjure  you hear me My appeal is to the benevolence the dignity of your heart Remember the virtuous plan you had formed  The combat in his mind was violent but short Truth made a struggle to gain the mastery and hope raised up a transient prospect of success which was as quickly overclouded by anger and despair and he stopped abruptly At least his voice and features were so impassioned that if these were not his sensations I have no clue to the human heart Perceiving him pause and doubt I replied  It cannot be Mr Clifton You this moment feel it cannot You have begun a course of fraud and which the whole arrangement of today is only  meant as so much pitiful machinery to effect You are conscious Mr Clifton you are conscious Lord FitzAllen that our meeting was not as you have both pretended accidental And I here call upon youyou Mr Clifton to tell for what purpose or where you have sent the lad who wrote the letter and to what place you have removed his aunt Such an artifice is vile sir And to challenge your accusers to stand forward and with a look such as you assumed to affirm  Upon your honour you were not the inventor and author of the letter  is so much more vile that I shudder for you Your own proceedings have conjured up a train of recollections that speak a concerted plan of perfidy You mean mischief But I once more tell  you sir I do not fear you I will not fear you My fears indeed are strong but they are for yourself Beware The more guilt you have committed the more you will be driven to commit Turn back You are in a dreadful path It is unworthy of you Mr Clifton It is unworthy of you  I instantly withdrew and was followed by Mrs Wenbourne who began to express something like blame of the positive manner in which I had spoken and the high language I had used to Lord FitzAllen but it was too feeble to incite an answer in my then state of mind I requested she would order her carriage and set me down She asked if I would not first pay my respects to my uncle I answered yes when my uncle should be more deserving of respect  She said I was a strange young lady I replied I sincerely hoped there were many young ladies stranger even than I  She took offence at these retorts upon her words and I perceived that though the spirit of my answer was right the manner was wrong and explained and apologised as became me She was appeased and when the carriage came again asked if I would not go with her to take leave I answered I imagined my uncle would be glad to wave the ceremony and as I thought he had acted very improperly curtsying and taking leave would but be practising the customary hypocrisy of our manners which I hoped I should on all occasions have the firmness to oppose  Accordingly my aunt went herself  and his lordship still preserving his dignity pretended to forbid me his presence till I better understood what was due to the relationship and rank in which he stood This my aunt reported and I returned no answer but left her to make her own reflections  Thus ended this painful interviewTell me what ought I to think What can be the purport of a conduct so very wrong Such a string of falsehoods How different would the behaviour of Mr Clifton have been had not conscious criminality oppressed and chained up his faculties Such persistence in duplicity must have some end in view Could I consent to marriage which is now utterly impossible he has certainly no such meaning If he had he could  not have written he could not have acted as he has done and even less in this last instance since his writing than before for he could not but know that though he could appear this generous man of honour to Lord FitzAllen he must stand detected by me It was not possible he should suppose otherwise  Well Let him mean me all the harm he pleases only let me find some opportunity of convincing him what a depraved unmanly trivial turn his mind has taken and let me but give it a different bent and I will willingly suffer all he shall have the power to inflict I do not find myself Louisa disposed to stand in that dread of baseness and violence which they generally inspire Virtue is not a passive but an active  quality and its fortitude is much more potent than the rash vehemence of vice  Adieu dear Louisa Peace and felicity guard you  A W ST IVES  LETTER CIV  COKE CLIFTON TO GUY FAIRFAX  London Dover Street  THANK you Fairfax for your speed and precautions which I must request you not to slacken Do not let the lad escape you his appearance here would be ruin Let but my grand scheme be completed and then I care  not though the legions of hell were to rise and mow and run a tilt at me I would face their whole fury The scene would delight me Let them come all I burn to turn upon and rend them The more desperate the more grateful  I told you Fairfax she hated me I have it now from her own mouth She feels I am become her foe My hand is already upon her My deepest darkest thoughts of vengeance do not exceed her imagination  And yet she fears me not Her words her looks her gestures are all cool firm defiance She is a miracle Fairfax A miracle But I will overmatch her A heroine She would have unhorsed Orlando himself had she  lived in the times of the knights Paladin  I am an insufferable booby an eternal lunatic for having first thought of quarrelling with her But it is too late I might have foreseen the advantages I give a woman like her She openly magnanimously tells me what my intents are and then spurns at them She keeps her anger under indeed but does not repress its energy a proof of the subjection in which she holds her passions She once endeavoured to teach me this art would I but have listened But that is past  I could not have thought it was in woman The poor wailing wateryeyed beings I had before encountered would not suffer me to suppose a female could  possess the high courage of the daring noble mind Never but one short moment did I overtop her nor are there any means but those I then used Inspire her with the dread of offending what she thinks principle and she becomes a coward  But I will rouse I will soar above her will subdue her will have her prostrate in humble submission or perish In the presence of witnesses I feel I cannot succeed but singly face to face passion to passion and being to being distinct and eminent as she stands above all womankind I will yet prove to her she is not the equal of the man Clifton  She herself has even thrown the gauntlet I have had such a scene with  her A public exhibition I cannot relate the manner of it I dare not trust my brain with the full reminiscence  Why did I quarrel with her She meant me wellTorturesI am a lunatic to tease myself with such recollections This is a damned wrong▪headed ignorant blundering vile world▪ and I cannot see my way in it I should have had no suspicion that it is all this but for her  That Henley shall never have her I'll murder him first Though the bottomless pit were to gape and swallow me he shall not have her The contemptible buzzard Sir Arthur is now completely veered about But in vain It shall not be By hell it shall not  This fellow this Henley must some  how or other be disposed of The contempt of the arrogant peer her uncle will harm him but little for the lord with all his dignity is no match for the plebeian  Neither will his lordship hastily seek another combat with his niece The only advantage I have in so insignificant an ally is that of hereafter making suspicion alight on Henley and not on me for I mean to carry them both off Henley and Anna I know not where or how I shall yet dispose of them but there is no other mode of accomplishing vengeance They must be confined too I care not how desperate the means I will not retract They shall be taught the danger of raising up an enemy like me I will have them at my feet Will  separate them Will glut my revenge and do the deed that shall prevent their ever meeting more except perhaps to reproach each other with the madness of having injured aggravated and defied a Clifton  My whole days are dedicated to this single object I have been riding round the skirts of this shapeless monster of a city on all sides in search of lonely tenantless houses some two of which I mean to provide with inhabitants I have met with more than one that are not ill situated  But I want agents Desperados Hungry and old traders in violence I care not where I go for them have them I will though I seek them in the purlieus of infamy and detestation To  succed by any other means is impossible She will not admit me in the same apartment with herself nor I believe in the same world had she the power to exclude me  I met her indeed at Lord FitzAllen's where the scene abovementioned passed but it was a plan concerted with his lordship which she easily detected and publicly reproached him with his duplicity I gloried to hear her for she had not injured him A poor compound of pride and selfishness Incapable of understanding the worth of such a niece But she made him feel his own insignificance  Henley and she are now never asunder I have mentioned the maid Laura to you She tells me they have long  conversations in the morning long walks in the afternoon and at night they have neither of them the power to rise and separate But I will come upon them My spirit at present is haunting them never leaves them girds at and terrifies them at every instant during their amorous dalliance I know it does They cannot get quit of me I am with them weighing them down convulsing them They feel they are in my gripeHah The thought is heart's ease  When there is no company and when Sir Arthur is not sitting with them this maid Laura has that honour Whence it appears that even these immaculate souls have some dread of scandal  And who is it inspires that dread It is I They seem to have discovered  that all circumstances all incidents wear a double face and that I am the malignant genius who can make which he pleases the true oneYes I am with them I send the Incubus that hagrides them in their dreams They gasp and would awake but cannot  Why could she not have bestowed all this affection upon me Why could she not I once thought a woman might have loved meBut it seems I was mistakenThe things that go by the general name of woman might but when I came to woman herself she could not though she tried  Would I were any where but in this infernal gloom It is a detestable country This town is one everlasting fog and its inhabitants are as cloudy as its  skies Every man broods over some solitary scheme of his own avoids human intercourse and hates to communicate the murk of his mind I am in a wilderness I fly the herd and the herd flies me We pass and scowl enmity at each other for I begin to look with abhorrence on the face of man There is not a single gleam of cheerfulness around me The sun has not once shone since the day of my disappointment which was itself thick darkness  Would I could getrid of myselfI am going to take a ride and make a second examination of a large lonely house beyond Knightsbridge It lies to the left and is at a sufficient distance from the road I think it will suit my purpose I must not have far to convey them  and Laura informs me their walks are most frequently directed through HydePark and among the fields at the back of Brompton  I must be as quiet and appear as little myself as possible for which reason I ride without a servant And though I have been industrious in reading advertisements and getting intelligence of empty houses I have not ventured to enquire personally Laura attends them in their walks but she is secure  They must both be seized at the same time and in a manner that shall frustrate all research It will then be concluded they have gone off together He is a powerful fellow a dangerous fellow and I must be well provided He shall never have her Fairfax I would die upon  the wheel hang like a negro and parch alive in the sun ere he should have her  C CLIFTON  P S  All society is become odious to me but chiefly that society which I am obliged to frequent This uncle FitzAllen aunt Wenbourne and brother Edward are three such poor beings and the censures they pass on a woman who is of an order so much above them are so vapid so selfish or so absurd that it is nauseating to sit and listen to them Yet these are the animals I am obliged to court Hypocrisy is a damned trade Fairfax and I will have full vengeance for having been forced upon such a practice The only present relief I have is to make the arrogant peer foam  with the idea of his relationship to a gardener's son This would be an exquisite pleasure but that it is millions of times more maddening to me than to him  LETTER CV  ANNA WENBOURNE ST IVES TO LOUISA CLIFTON  London Grosvenor Street  ABIMELECH is come up to town I am obliged very respectfully to call him Mr Henley when Sir Arthur hears me in compliance to his feelings and he has hinted that hereafter when his name is written it must be tagged with an esquire  The old miser Well Louisa let it be the old gentleman is so eager in pursuit of his project that he can take no rest and is unwilling Sir Arthur should take any He has a prodigious quantity of cunning Whatever he may know of the theory of the passions as a general subject no person certainly knows better how to work upon the passions of Sir Arthur at least no person who will condescend to take such an advantage His discourse is such a continued mixture of WenbourneHill his money mortgages grottos groves the wherewithals and the young gentleman his son that laughter scarcely can hold to hear him Were the thing practicable he would render Frank Henley himself ridiculous  It is pleasant to remark what a check the presence of this favourite son is upon his loquacity He never suspects the possibility of there being a mortal superior to himself at other times whereas he has then a latent consciousness of his own ridicule The effect which the absence of Frank has produced with the favour he is in with me and the resolute manner in which he conquered his father when he last went down to WenbourneHill have made a total change in the old man's behaviour to this formerly neglected but now half adored son Were habits so inveterate capable of being eradicated Frank would yet teach him virtue but the task is too difficult  He is certainly in a most delicious  trance His son to be married to the daughter of his master That master a baronet And the estates of that baronet to be his own as he supposes to all eternity For the avaricious dreams of selfishness are satisfied with nothing less These are joys that swell and enlarge even his narrow heart into something that endeavours to mimic urbanity  Whenever Sir Arthur mentions Lord FitzAllen or the family consent honest Aby in a moment conjures up WenbourneHill a hermitage and a wilderness and for the first day if he found that dose not strong enough to produce its effect foreclosures were added to the mixture Your own heart Louisa will tell you what Frank's feelings were at such a mean menace and  though to stop his garrulity entirely was not in the power of man he determined to silence him on that subject But the cunning Abimelech turned even this incident to advantage by taking care to inform Sir Arthur of Frank's generosity  Thus Louisa things are at present in a train which some months ago I should indeed very little have expected But such are the energies of virtue How changed at present do all surrounding objects seem To me they were never dark but they were not always pleasant They are now all cheerfulness and perspicacity We have the most charming walks and the most delightful conversations Louisa and on subjects so expansive so sublime Often do I say  Why is my friend not with us  Why does she not come and bear her part in discussion She whose mind is so penetrating and whose thoughts are so grand  But we shall meet Days and years of happiness are before us The prospect is rapture Yes Louisa we shall meet and I hope quickly  A W ST IVES  LETTER CVI  COKE CLIFTON TO GUY FAIRFAX  London Dover Street  JOIN chorus and rejoice with me Fairfax for I feel something like a transient hilarity of heart I think I am half in a temper to tell my tale as it ought to be told Time was when it would have been pregnant with humour  The very masterdevil that I wanted  has appeared to me and we have signed and consigned ourselves over to the great work of mutual vengeance Be patient and you shall hear the manner of it  Two nights ago I was at the theatre The king was there Garrick played the crowd was great and no places were to be procured During the first act I and two more stood elbowing each other at the door of one of the front boxes the seats of which were all full The person who was next me was hardfavoured had a look of audacious impudence with that mixture of dress which forms the vulgar genteel and spoke the brogue  The act being over the audience rose and my gentleman with the nonchalance  assurance of his character a total disregard of the feelings and convenience of others and an entire complaisance for his own stepped forward into the second seat from the door on which there were previously four people its full compliment But he had noticed they were not all so athletic as himself and was determined to make them sit close  The persons next him observing his redoubtable look hesitated for a moment but at length began to remonstrate They addressed him two or three times without his deigning to appear to hear them till either encouraged by his silence or warmed by vexation they spoke loud enough to call the attention of the people around them  The Hibernian then sat himself down threw his arm over the railing of the box and his body in a careless posture and very coolly answered  Pray now be asy and don't disturb the good company  A squabble ensued and the Irishman continued to answer them with the utmost contempt In a short time two of them gained courage enough to threaten to turn him out to which he replied  Oh By the sweet Jasus but I should be glad to see the pretty boy that would dare to lay a little finger upon me  After another wrangle and treating their reasonings and half menaces with the most contemptuous disregard a gentleman from the next box interfered  and observed it certainly was very improper behaviour The Irishman turned round surveyed him from head to foot and answered  I find you have all got your quarrelling tackle on board to night and so as I must fight somebody and as you mister appear to be the most of a gintleman why I will talk to you when the play is over For which raison sit down and make all yourselves asy  The beginning of the second act and the impatience of the house to hear their favourite soon imposed silence and the Irishman kept his seat  I was so much diverted by the complete impudence of the fellow that though one of the boxkeepers had found me a place I determined to return  and see how this petty brawl was to end Accordingly I took care to be round in time before the curtain dropped till which the hero of it had kept quiet possession of his usurped seat  The moment the audience rose he turned about and with a look which I imagine no man but himself could assume first on this side of him and next on that addressed his opponents with  Now if any of you are still disordered in the body and want to lose a little blood why follow me  The two persons that sat next to him were both Jews and one of them who appeared to have the most spirit had a knotted crabstick in his hand and insisted that the Irishman should not leave the company till he had first given satisfaction  for the insult he had committed on them all The Hibernian replied  All Is it all together you mane or one after another Perhaps you don't understand the tools of a gintleman and want to box me Faith and I should have no great objection to that either with any half dozen of you one down and t'other come on But you must use no unlawful weapons my sweet fillow  So saying he wrested the Jew's crabstick from him laid hold of it at each end and snapped it in two across the railing of the box adding with infinite composure of countenance  This is an improper plaything for you master Jackey and you might do yourself a damage with it Here is  half a crown for you Take it man and buy yoursilf a genteel bit of rattan to beat the little pug dogs away when they bark after you in the street  Insolent as the fellow was there was no resisting his humour and the laugh was general The vexed Israelite endeavoured to persist and the Irishman drew a dirty letter out of his pocket from the back of which he tore the direction and giving it to the angry Jew said  If you have any stomach for a good breakfast tomorrow morning I shall be at home and the hot rolls and butter will be ready at ten  He then strode over the seats and went into the lobby where he was followed by the crowd  My curiosity was highly excited and I requested the Jew to let me read his address  Imagine Fairfax my surprise at seeing the name of Mac Fane That is of the gambler and bully who some time ago had been attempting to plunder brother Edward and who had been so successfully opposed by the family knighterrant Henley Among the busy conjectures of my fermenting brain concerning the instruments I might happen to want should things as they have done come to an extremity the supposed qualifications of this hero had more than once passed in review The behaviour to which I had this evening been a witness perfectly confirmed all my former conjectures which I instantly recollected  I therefore determined not to lose sight of him  Before I knew who he was I had been glad to see the squabble continued because it drew out the strong traits of this very eccentric genius but I grew impatient to put an end to it the moment I had made the discovery  The thing was not difficult His character was too desperate and determined not to inspire fear and the humour of his phraseology and brogue made the laugh always on his side The passions of his opponents counteracting each other died away The farce was going to begin and he advised them to  go and not lose full eighteen pennyworth out of their five shillings  Finding the morsel was too hard for  their digestion they took his advice and returned quietly to their seats while he several times traversed the lobby and looked first into one box and then into another to let them see that there he was  My resolution was formed and I soon found an opportunity of falling into conversation with him and as I took care that my tone should answer the intended purpose he presently invited me to adjourn and take what he called a bottle and a bird at the Shakespeare  The proposal exactly suited me and away we went  He called for a private room which I should have done if he had not though with a very different view My appearance made him hope he had caught a  gudgeon He presently began to turn the discourse upon various kinds of gaming Billiards tennis hazard and passdice were each of them mentioned and to encourage him I gave him to understand I knew them all He then talked of cards and asked if I had any objection to take a hand at picquet  just to pass away an hour before supper  I answered none  Accordingly the waiter was rung for and the cards were presently upon the table  He proposed playing for a trifle from one guinea to five not more  becase as why he was tied up from deep play He had lost five thousand pounds within six weeks and they had had a pretty pigeon of him    Had you but seen the form and features of this pigeon Fairfax  For which raison he must take care and not be plucked any more It was the misfortune of his timper not to know when to stop and there was not so unlucky a fillow in the three kingdoms He was always the bubble play at what he would and every snapjack knew him to be his mark  Such was the lesson which this fellow had got by rote and had been retailing to all comers for years But I have observed of gamblers that they cannot forbear rehearsing their own cant even in the company of each other and when they are convinced every soul that hears them knows they are lying  I however had my purpose to serve  and we sat down to our game The stakes were five guineas a side According to custom I won the three or four first games and he pretended to curse and fret and again ran over his beadroll of being pigeoned plucked bare bubbled done up and the whole catalogue of like genteel phrases  The first game he won he proposed as luck was perhaps taking a turn in his favour to double the stakes and I indulged him He suffered me to win the following game I say suffered cheating being taken into the account for I am certain that at the fair game I am his master But that is no matter  The three following games were all his own and he then began to repeat  the remainder of his part  By the blissed Jasus he would not believe his own eyes Three games together  The fellow swore with one of the deepest oaths his memory could furnish such a thing had never happened to him before in his whole life  But now that he was in luck he would as soon play for a hundred guineas as for a thirteener  He endeavoured to provoke me to increase the stake and by the supper not coming up I am convinced the waiter and he understood each other and that the signal had been given I refused to play for a greater sum and we continued till he had won fifty guineas he incessantly swearing  By the blissed crook By the hind leg of the holy lamb  By Saint Peter's pretty beard  and by all manner of oaths some of them of the most whimsical and others of the most horrible kind that he had never been a winner so much before in all his life From the first ten guineas that he won to the last it was still the same tune  I then rang the bell and ordered supper thinking the sum sacrificed quite sufficient though not more than enough to serve my purpose  While we were eating he endeavoured by all the arts he knew to excite the passion of gaming in me and he is a tolerable adept But my mind was too intent upon another subject I watched the moment when he was at the height of his hopes which I had purposely encouraged to produce my intended effect  and then asked him if he did not know Captain St Ives  Impudent as the fellow is his countenance for a moment was fixed his mouth open and his eye struggling to get rid of alarm that it might begin its enquiries I followed up my blow by adding  You won three thousand guineas of him I think Mr Mac Fane which I am told were never paid  The fellow put his hand into a sidepocket which he had in the body of his coat I instantly suspected he had a small pair of pistols there and my suspicions were afterward confirmed He drew it back having satisfied himself that they were actually forthcoming and then recovered himself so far as to ask  Pray sir are you acquainted with Captain St Ives  I am sir answered II likewise know Mr Henley  You do sir said the astonished Mac Fane  I do sir I am intimate with Sir Arthur St Ives and he is the son of his gardener a low fellow that acts as the baronet's man of all work his steward his overseer and his cashkeeper  This contempt thrown on the character of Henley gave the Irishman some relief By the holy poker said Mac Fane but I always thought he was a spalpeen and no gintleman  I think you have no great cause to like him much sir continued I from the account that I have heard  His choler began to rise and his eyes assumed an uncommon ferocity Like him Sweet Jasus snatch me out of the world if I don't pay off an old score with him yet before I die  I thought as much sir answered I  Sir Replied he again staring with reviving alarm and suspicion  I continuedTo tell you the truth Mr Mac Fane that is the very subject which brought you and I into company this evening I suspected your hate of Henley and to be sincere I hate him too  Had you seen the fellow's face brighten Fairfax and after brightening begin to flame you would not have readily forgotten the picture  But I am rather surprised to meet you in public sir added I  What do you mane by that sir  I thought you deemed it prudent to keep out of the way on account of that affair  I felt some gratification in playing thus upon his fearsHe now once more put his hand into his sidepocket and pulling out his pistols laid them before him By Jasus sir I don't very well know what you would be at But when I understand the full tote of your questions I shall know how to give an answer  I could not very well digest this oblique menace but to have quarrelled with such a rascal would in every sense have been madness You have a wellmounted pair of pistols there said I Mr Mac Fane I'll bet you the fifty guineas  double or quit I break this china plate at the first shot ten paces distant  By the great grumbler answered he but I'll bet you don't immediately delivering me one pistol and taking up and unlocking the other himself Accordingly I placed the plate against the wall fired and was not far from the centre Upon my honour and soul sir said Mac Fane but I find you are a good shot and I shall be glad to be better acquainted with you  Having convinced him that I could hit a mark as well as himself I returned to the subject of Henley and though I could not bring him to be explicit I learned from him that he was acquainted with Henley's aversion to prosecute but  does not know on what that aversion is founded Beside which he confides in a want of witnesses as I could perceive except that he has some fear of his accomplice Webb a man in whose company this very Mac Fane once attempted to rob Sir Arthur and whom I suspect he would impeach but that it would ruin all his gambling views For he has found means of associating with that whole class of young fools of fortune whose perverted education leads them to take pleasure in the impudence and humour of such a fellow as well as in seeing each other stripped and ruined by turns but who would never admit him as a companion did they know he had been guilty of an act so desperate as that of going on the highway Scarcely any  thing short of this can expel such a fellow from such society  But though he thinks himself secure in consequence of the lenity of Henley he hates him as sincerely as if he were pursuing him to the gallows The loss of the three thousand guineas is one great motive and another is that he felt he was outbraved by Henley whom he could not terrify but who on the contrary terrified him  I found he had even formed a scheme of petty vengeance which was to waylay Henley with some bruising fellows of his acquaintance for he is acquainted with daring villains of all descriptions one of whom was to insult provoke him to fight and beat him while Mac Fane  himself should keep at some distance disguised  It was with some difficulty I could persuade him to desist from this plan and join in projects of my own But at last however he was convinced that to rob him of his mistress and awaken him from all his dreams of imaginary bliss to the torture I am preparing would be more effectual revenge than a paltry beating Not to mention that I firmly believe instead of being beaten he would conquer the best prizefighter they could bring for he is really a powerful and extraordinary fellow  But you will perceive Fairfax I was obliged to inform him of a part of my own views and that I might fix him I  determined to bid high I told him I had Henley and another person to secure and that if he would aid me himself and provide other assistants to act under his directions without seeing or being informed of me I would give him a thousand guineas as soon as all this should be perfectly accomplished And as an earnest of my generosity I put down the fifty guineas saying that the wager I had made with him was not a fair one for that it was fifty guineas to a straw in my favour he had no chance of winning  He was quite satisfied with my offer strengthened as it was by the gratification of his own passions I told him what a puissant hero Henely is and of the necessity of coming upon him by  surprise I told him I had seen a house as before described beyond Knightsbridge which pleased me but that I could not find another near enough in which to secure Henley  The geography of the place I mentioned seemed to start an idea in his mind and he told me if I would meet him in two days at the same tavern he would in the mean time not only make preparations and procure assistants but perhaps bring me further intelligence As the fellow's brain seemed busy I did not wish to rob him of the selfsatisfaction of invention and we accordingly parted making the appointment he proposed  Of all existing beings he perhaps  was the only one who could in a country like this become the proper instrument of my revenge And yet Fairfax he is a hateful fellow His language his looks his manners his passions are all hateful Courage excepted there is not a single trait in him but what is abominable He delights in talking of hocking men chalking them and cutting them down Every time his anger rises against any one these are its attendant ideas Such a fellow must come to some tragical end He can never die of old age and scarcely of disease Nothing but the lead and steel in which he delights can end him  So it is and I have no remedy But he shall be to me no more than an implement  with which I will carve the coming banquet  How minute are the chances and events on which we depend A few slight alterations of incident and how different would have been the train of my thoughts She might have been happy with me for I loved her Fairfax I loved her I feel it more and more and were but circumstances a little more savourable I believe I should turn about and take a contrary path  But it cannot be The barrier is insurmountable An adamantine wall reaching to the skies I remember what she said at her proud uncle's table  I have an abhorrence Mr Clifton of the errors in which you are  now indulging  Abhorrence was the word FairfaxIt has been at my tongue's end ever sinceAnd when she talked of my errors she meant me  I ultimately and determinedly renounce all thought of him  This was her language I knew before which way her heart went and can I suppose now she has got a fair excuse that she will not profit by it Oh no I am not so ill read as that in the passions But I have said the wordThey shall never come togetherThey never never shall  C CLIFTON  LETTER CVII  COKE CLIFTON TO GUY FAIRFAX  London Dover Street  I HAVE received your dissuasive epistle Fairfax It found me moody and did not contribute to make me merry To own the truth no ghost need rise to tell me the methods I use are inclined to the violent Can you find me better Nay can you find any  other I care not for consequences I brave them all  Time was that I could have been happy with her Ay and should but for this fiend Henley He sleeps securely Let him sleep on I will soon awaken him  I thought I should have been tortured but by one chief passion and that the love of vengeance would have enveloped me wholly but they are all devouring me by turns I certainly hate her and him I abhor Yet pictures of imaginary happiness that might have been are continually rising and vanishing in gloomy regret He too at the very moment that I could murder him I am obliged to admire  Still he shall not have her Though  death overtake him her and me he shall not have her But what is death A thing to covet not to dread 'Tis existence only that is hatefulWould that my bones were now moulderingWhy have I brains and nerves and sensibilitiesOh that I were in the poisonous desert where I might gulp mephitic winds and drop dead or in a moment be buried in tornados of burning sand Would that my scull were grinning there and blanching rather than as it is consciously parching scorched by fires itself has kindled  I spent all yesterday with that Irish scoundrel Malignity is his element and mischief his delight I suspect by  his assiduity that he is poor just at present for a more industrious demon black Cocytus does not yield He is already provided with associates and has found another principal agent for the great work It is a strange expedient But these are strange fellows l And yet it is a lucky one superior to any that I had projected  When I mentioned the Knightsbridge road at our first interview Mac Fane recollected that an intimate of his had just set up what was to him a new trade in the neighbourhood that of being the keeper of a madhouse He determined to go and propose the business to him and as the fellow was preparing to advertise for lunatics but had not yet got  a single patient there was a complete opening for such a plan  He proposed taking me to see this intended guardian of maniacs and his house and I ordered a postchaise for that purpose that I might hide myself in one corner of it and not let a living soul detect me with such a companion  As we were going I enquired if this keeper were an Irishman He took offence and retorted  What did I mane by an Irishman Becase he is a rogue you think he is an Irishman By the holy carpenter you need not come to Ireland for that kind of ware You have a viry pritty breed of rogues of your own But he is not Irish He  is one of your own sulky English bugs  The description was not inapplicable for I think I never beheld a more lowering blackbrowed evileyed fellow since the hour I first saw light He had all the gloom of the most irrascible bulldog but without his generous courage He seemed more proper to make men mad than cure them of madness But he had two excellent qualities for my purpose poverty and a disposition to all ill  I am got into excellent company But I care not I will on All this seems as if it were but the prologue to the tragedy But be it that or be it what it willI care nothing for myself  and I have little cause to care more for them She never had any mercy on me and least this last interview when I was pleading before her pompous uncle  I have been obliged to hold consultations with these Satanic rascals to concert ways and means The most secure we have been able to devise relative to Henley is to have a straight waistcoat to come upon him suddenly and to encrust him in it before he shall know what we are about This with a gag will make him safe But there must not be less than four fellows and those stout ones Nothing must be left to chance  Three more must be provided for the lady of whom Mac Fane himself proposes  to be one But he means to keep out of sight of Henley till he is in cuftody  I have various preparations yet to make Mac Fane is to go and hire me the empty house tomorrow It is furnished but it must be aired for I would not have her die a paltry catchcold death I would treat her like a gentlewoman in every respect but one and in that I will have as little compassion on her as she has had on me  It might have been otherwise I came to her a generous lover I saw her and was amazed at her beauties captivated by her enchanting manners soothed by her unvaried sweetness But this sweetness she has turned to gall I adored her and was prepared eternally  to adore But injury followed injury in such quick succession that apathy itself called aloud for vengeance  I own it is true what she said at her uncle's that I had made a resolution not to marry her But what were my resolutions She herself could not but feel she had the power to break them all But she had not the will Fairfax It rankles there She hates me and what is more damnable she loves another  I must turn my thoughts again to this detested madhouse man and the scenery around it All the avenues must be examined and all the byepaths and open roads that lead toward both houses inspected that Mac Fane and his emissaries  may make no blunder I will if possible keep out of the action but I will be near at hand  I have a secret wish the moment all is over to fly the odious scene for horribly odious it will be but it would have the appearance of cowardice It must end tragically Not even the poor creatures who stand in the place of her natural guardians tame as they are can suffer such an insult Yet which of them dare look me in the face and call himself my enemy And after injuring her shall I hesitate at trampling upon them  I must steel my heart Fairfax when I go to the encounter must recapitulate all my wrongs I have them noted down severally as they occurred I  need but read to rage What do I talkReadCan I forget them No night nor day They are my familiars They wake with me sleep with me walk with me ride with me glower with me curse with mebut never smile with me They are become my dearest intimates I cherish and hug them to my heart Their biting is my only pleasure  I cannot forget this keeper He is a foulfaced fellow Has a wry look a dogged dungeon hue of the deepest dusk and progeny of Beelzebub I wonder by whom where and why such fellows are begotten  There are horrid villians in the world Villains by trade that never felt the strong impulse of highminded passion  that could breakfast in an hospital dine in a slaughterhouse and sup in the sanguinary field of battle listening to the groans of the mangled or toss them on the points of forks to smelt in a heap I have heard her talk something of these depraved natures and of the times when they are all to be humanised Can you conjecture when Fairfax Yet she said they should be and I was half inclined to believe her  C CLIFTON  P S  I meant to notice that passage in your letter in which you mention Beaunoir but I forgot it till this moment So you are at last inclined to think Anna St Ives must be something more than you every day meet from  the rapturous description of that rodomontade Count After all I have written your faith wanted the seal of such a lunatic Had you forgotten that the time was when I would have married her And did that say nothing  The Count is preparing for England Let him come I remember one of his crazy phrases and claims was that he would be her champion should ever base knight attempt to do her harm Nor have I forgotten his intended visit received by Henley May the winds set fair and blow him quickly over Should he have any such frolics in his brain we shall not be long in coming to terms  This Mac Fane is incessantly importuning me to play and what is strange  has several times excited the desire in me I took up the dice box after we had been to the madhouse and threw half a dozen casts at hazard but I soon found it was in vain and checked myself I know I have the command of my own temper in that respect  I have been reading over this tedious homily and find it most ineffably dull But what is to be done My gaiety is gone My high spirits are converted into black bile My thoughts are hellebore and deadly nightshade and hilarity is for ever poisoned  LETTER CVIII  ANNA WENBOURNE ST IVES TO LOUISA CLIFTON  London GrosvenorStreet  HAVE I been unjust to the brother of my friend Or had my words the power over him to turn him from a guilty purposeWell rather ay infinitely rather let me be a false accuser than he culpable He seeks me no more offers not to molest me and I  hope has forgotten me at least has seen the error of endeavouring to accomplish a purpose so criminal by means so base I expected storms but a sweet calm has succeeded that seems to portend tranquillity and happiness  With respect to me and Frank our union appears to be hastening to a conclusion Sir Arthur impelled forward by his hopes and fears proceeds though reluctantly to act contrary to the wishes of my arrogant uncle Mrs Wenbourne is dissatisfied but her opposition is feeble for Edward is reconciled to the match having no other motive but the acquisition of a sum of money for his consent to dock the entail and of the manner in which this sum will be squandered  we have already had sufficient proof  I understand Lord FitzAllen affects to credit a report of a very ridiculous though as some would think it of a very injurious nature which is that there was a collusion between Frank Henley and Mac Fane respecting my brother's gambling affair The circumstances necessary to render this probable are so violent as immediately to expose its absurdity and to make it matter of amazement how such an assertion could be invented or circulated  What could be Frank's motiveMy wise uncle has his answer ready  That of imposing upon the family in order to marry me  And what Mac Fane's "A bribe" is a short phrase and soon said  I imagine it to be some dream of my uncle's who has an aptitude for this kind of invention and who having once put a few incidents together that seem to agree persuades himself with great facility that the fable he has created is fact Petty calumny like this is wholly incapable of moving Frank Henley  The restless crafty Abimelech has prevailed on Sir Arthur to go down with him to WenbourneHill He well knows how much his own power will be increased by the old habits of Sir Arthur and the ease with which they can be revived by this his interested abettor Not but I am well convinced when once every thing shall be settled and he have  no longer any thing to fear from the opposition of Sir Arthur he will be as little a friend to improving as any of us Various hints which have dropped from him would have proved this to Sir Arthur had he not been blind enough to suppose that he being a baronet honest Aby is bound ever to remain his most obedient slave and steward forgetting the proofs he has received that Abimelech at present is more inclined to command than to obey and that when he parts with money he must have what he calls the whys and the wherefores  His confidence in Frank however is now so entire that he has entrusted the transaction of certain money business to him necessary on the present occasion which he came up purposely to negotiate  himself but which he is now convinced can be done full as prudently and safely by his son But a few months ago Frank tells me he petitioned this father in vain for thirty pounds who now commits thousands to his keeping  Not but it is from a conviction that there is no propensity in Frank to waste one of those guineas of which he is so enamoured Without the least love of money Frank is a rigid economist The father indulges no false wants because it would be expensive the son has none to indulge Habits which in the one are the fruits of avarice in the other are the offspring of wisdom  Abimelech has some confused suspicion that Frank acts from higher motives than himself and such as he does  not understand but still he hopes they are all founded on his own favourite basis the love of hoarding Nor can he very well persuade himself that this love is not the grand mover with all men of sense among whom he now ranks his son high  But ah Louisa how different are the views of this worthy this heavenlygifted son He is anxiously studious to discover how he may apply the wealth that may revert to him most to benefit that society from which it first sprang The best application of riches is one of our frequent themes because it will be one of our first duties The diffusion of knowledge or more properly of truth is the one great good to which wealth genius and existence ought all to be applied  This noble purpose gives birth to felicity which is in itself grand inexhaustible and eternal  How ineffable is the bliss of having discovered a friend like Frank Henley who will not only pursue this best of purposes himself but will through life conduct me in the same path will aid my efforts to promote the great work and by a combination of those powers we happen to possess will add energy to effort and perhaps render it fifty fold more pervading and effective  Husband and wife parent and child are ties which at present claim or rather extort a part of our attention But oh how poor how insignificant are they when compared to the claims of eternal justice which bind man to man in equal  and impartial benevolence over the face of the whole earth and render the wandering Arab who is in need of aid or instruction from me as truly my brother as the one my mother gave me  I seem now but beginning the journey of life and to have found a companion guide and consoler like Frank Henley is surely no common felicity May the fates grant my Louisa just such another  A W ST IVES  P S  You do not think Louisa no I am sure you cannot think that all the ardour I felt for the recovery of a mind like Mr Clifton's is lost Far far otherwise I still hope to see him even more than my fondest reveries have imagined  But I am not the agent or at least this is not the moment or which is still more probable no agent now is wanted His mind has been obliged to enquire and though passion may for a time suppress truth its struggles will be incessant must be so in a mind of such activity and must at last be victorious The grand enemy of truth is the torpid state of error for the beginning of doubt is always the beginning of discovery Let us then continue to love this man of wonderful genius not for what he is but what he shall be  LETTER CIX  FRANK HENLEY TO OLIVER TRENCHARD  London GrosvenorStreet  OH Oliver how fair is the prospect before me How fruitful of felicity how abundant in bliss Yes my friend jointly will we labour your most worthy father you I Anna her friend and all the converts we can make to truth  to promote the great end we seek We will form a little band which will daily increase will swell to a multitude ay till it embrace the whole human species  Surely Oliver to be furnished with so many of the means of promulgating universal happiness is no small blessing My feelings are all rapture And yet if I know my heart it is not because I have gained a selfish solitary good but because I live in an age when light begins to appear even in regions that have hitherto been thick darkness and that I myself am so highly fortunate as to be able to contribute to the great the universal cause the progress of truth the extirpation of error and the general perfection of mind I and those dear  friends I have named who are indeed dear because of their ardent and uniform love of virtue  Neither Oliver are all our hopes of Clifton lost Anna thinks and so do I that he has heard too much ever to forget it all or rather that he has a mind so penetrating and so eternally busy that having been once led to enquire it is scarcely in the power of accident wholly to impede the progress of enquiry And should accident be favourable that progress would indeed be rapid By his intercourse with Anna his mind is become impregnated with the seeds of truth and surely the soil is too rich for these seeds not to spring bud and bear a plenteous harvest Ay Oliver fear not It is not the beauty of  the picture that seduces but the laws of necessity which declare the result for which we hope to be inevitable  My present state of happiness meets some slight check from incidental circumstances not in my power to guide My father and Sir Arthur are doing what I believe to be a right thing but from wrong motives The prodigal Edward from a very different avarice of enjoyment is eager to dock the entail The sum he is to receive will soon be squandered and he will then be as eager to imagine himself treated with injustice and will conceive himself left half to perish with want if his accustomed dissipation be not supplied But that it must not be If we can teach him better we will if not he must be left to  repine and accuse and we must patiently suffer the error which we cannot cure  Lord FitzAllen indulges himself in thinking as much ill of me as he can and in speaking all he thinks But this is indeed a trifle I know that the mistakes of his mind situated as he is are incurable and to grieve or feel pain for what cannot be avoided is neither the act of wisdom nor of virtue  F HENLEY  LETTER CX  FRANK HENLEY TO OLIVER TRENCHARD  London Grosvenor Street  I DID not intend to have written again so soon but an incident has occurred which perplexes all reasoning upon it and again engenders doubt It relates to Clifton  I last night attended Anna to CoventGarden playhouse where about eight  o'clock I was obliged to leave her having an appointment with some gentlemen in the city relative to my father's money affairs at that hour which having settled it was agreed I should return in the carriage for Anna before the play was ended to conduct her home Accordingly having met my men of business whom on Friday next I am to meet again to receive eight thousand pounds I drove back to Covent Garden  It was then about ten o'clock The coachman stopped at the Piazza I alighted but as I was stepping out of the carriage whom should I see but the gambler and highwayman Mac Fane linked arm in arm with Mr Clifton I was struck with amazement as well I might be A thousand confused doubts  succeeded to each other which I had neither time nor indeed power to unravel  However it seemed to me almost impossible that Mr Clifton should know the man and suffer himself to be seen in public with such a character For certainly a want of selfrespect is not one of the habitual mistakes of Mr Clifton I stopped some little time in this state of perplexity but at last concluded it would be highly culpable in me to leave Mr Clifton ignorant of the character of his acquaintance They had gone toward KingStreet and I hastened after them  I soon came up with them and addressing myself to Mr Clifton said  Sir  it is incumbent on me to inform you of a particular of which I imagine you are ignorant The name of the man you are in company with is Mac Fane You have heard his history He is the gambler who endeavoured to defraud Captain St Ives of three thousand pounds  I have before acquainted thee Oliver of the ferocious character of this Mac Fane of which I have now had further proofs I had scarcely finished my phrase before he replied with one of his accustomary oaths  You're a scoundrel and a liar  and immediately made a blow at me  Being previously on my guard and watchful of his motions I stepped quickly  back and he missed me and reeled This was in KingStreet where I overtook them  I turned back intending not to notice his insult but he was too much enraged to suffer me to escape unless I had thought proper to run He is a very muscular fellow and confident of his own strength No man could be more determined than I was to avoid so absurd a contest had it been possible but it was not He made several blows at me two or three of which took effect before I returned one of them But finding that I must be obliged to beat him in order to get rid of him and that there was absolutely no other mode I began my task with all necessary determination  The mob collected apace and we  were presently surrounded by passengers waiters chairmen footmen hackneycoachmen and linkboys It was a strange disgusting situation but it did not admit of a remedy This fellow Mac Fane has studied the whole school of assault and is a practised pugilist When I was a boy thou knowest Oliver and before thy worthy father had taught me better I was myself vain of my skill and prowess I was not therefore the novice which he expected to have found Not to mention Oliver that energy of mind if it be real and true energy is itself without any such contemptible knowledge sufficient to overcome the strongest efforts of tyranny  Of this I presently made Mr Mac Fane sensible After the very first onset  he felt himself cowed which increased his rage so much that he endeavoured to have recourse to the most malignant and cruel expedients to obtain victory This obliged me to give him several hard and very dangerous blows which I should otherwise have been cautious of doing and the effects of which he will for some time continue to feel  He fought however with great obstinacy and in a manner which proved how much his ambition was wounded by being conquered The mob as in all such cases chose different sides but much the greatest part was for me They several times saw the malicious and evil intentions of Mac Fane and he once received a blow for them from  one of the assistants which made him more guarded  It is delightful to the philosopher to perceive how even in error justice struggles to shew itself Those rules which are the laws of honour to the mob originate in this noble principle and never is the infraction of justice more dangerous than at such moments when the mind is awakened to full exertion  Still it was a painful and degrading situation Wert thou ever at the mercy of a mob Didst thou ever feel the littleness of thy own faculties when exerted to make a confused multitude act rationally at the very time that thou thyself wert apparently acting like a fool or a madman If so Oliver thou  canst conceive something of the contempt which I felt for myself during this scene Can a general thinkest thou if he be really a fit person to be a general feel otherwise in the heat of battle For I am mistaken if armies of the best disciplined men brought into action do not more or less become a mob And added to this sense of imbecility what must the general's feelings be the next morning when he goes to view the wretched scene of his own making Does he go to view it thinkest thou or does he shun the sight If he go he is a fiend and if he stay away he is worse  The battle being ended and the rage of Mr Mac Fane though perhaps increased obliged to restrain itself there  stood I surrounded by my applauding admirers suffering a thousand ridiculous interrogatories and confined to the spot for the want of clothes My hat and coat I had committed to one person and my watch and purse to another taking it for granted the latter would have been stolen from me if I had not as was actually the fact for my breeches pockets were turned inside out I had rightly concluded that the chances were more favourable in trusting to a person I should select than to the honesty of a mob in the confines of CoventGarden  I was fortunate the whole of my moveables again made their appearance and it gave me great pleasure because I had trusted my purse and watch to a poor fellow The consciousness of his own  honesty was a greater pleasure to him than the recompense he received from me though I thought it my duty to reward him liberally Beside he had seen me ill treated and had conceived an affection for me or more properly for the justice of my cause and he rejoiced exultingly in my victory  I escaped from the shouts and congratulations of my greasy wellmeaning companions as fast as I could and after a further delay of stepping into a coffeehouse to wash and adjust my appearance as well as circumstances would permit I joined Anna who began to be alarmed the play being over and the house almost empty  I saw no more of Clifton But that  affords me no clue If he were before unacquainted with Mac Fane he would hasten from such a companion with vexation and contempt and if the contrary his chagrin at being seen by me would equally induce him to shun us Mind as I have always remarked Oliver and as I have before reasoned with thee relative to him is slow in ridding itself of the habits of prejudice even when prejudice itself seems to have ceased  'Tis true that conjectures disadvantageous to Clifton have when Anna and I were considering this incident intruded themselves forcibly upon us but they were only conjectures and I hope ill founded Indeed they are improbable for Clifton could not knowingly  league himself with a man like Mac Fane except for purposes too black or too desperate for even passions so violent as his to entertain  I know mind to be capable of astonishing mistakes nor can I pretend when I recollect the proofs on record to say what are the boundaries of error nor indeed what are the boundaries of probability But I think Clifton could not make himself the associate of Mac Fane  I should pronounce more boldly still but that I cannot conceive how it was possible for a character so legible and gross as that of this gambler to impose for a moment on Coke Clifton acquainted as he is with the world and  accustomed to detect and satirize what he understands to be absurdity I can only say if he be proceeding in error so flagrant and deep as this he is a man much to be feared but more to be pitied  F HENLEY  LETTER CXI  COKE CLIFTON TO GUY FAIRFAX  London Dover Street  AGAIN and again Fairfax this is an infernal world A vile disgusting despicable besotted ass of a world Existence in it is not worth accepting and the sooner we spurn it from us the better we shall assert our claim to the  dignity and wisdom of which it is destitute  How do I despise the blundering insolent scoundrel with whom I am linked How despicable am I to myself  I last night met the fellow again at the Shakespeare Of all his dirty qualities not one of them is so tormenting as his familiar impudence There is no repressing it except by cutting his throat a business at which he is always alert Nothing delights him so much as to talk of extinguishing men treading out their souls feeding upon their lifetime and other strange revolting phrases all of the same sanguinary sort  Having consulted with him concerning the seizure of Anna and Frank and concluded that the affair should be ended  as speedily as possible I wished to have shaken him off and retired but the thing was impracticable I do not choose that my own carriage should attend me on these expeditions and as it was a rainy night I knew the difficulty of getting a coach I therefore staid an hour till the entertainment should be begun and the Piazza probably more clear  As there is no sitting in his company without some species of gaming for his whole conversation that subject excepted consists of oaths duels and the impudent scoundrels he has put out of the world I took a few throws at hazard with him and as I was very careful to call for fresh dice and to watch his motions I was a winner hazard perhaps  being the fairest of all games if the dice be not foul He ran over his usual litany of being pigeoned and about ten o'clock I left play and determined to sally forth being apprehensive of engaging too deeply at the game if I staid longer  The moment we had descended the stairs he impudently laid hold of my arm My blood boiled Fairfax Yet I was obliged to submit  This was not all The precautions I had taken were but a kind of presentiment of the vexation that was preparing for me Just as we quitted the door of the tavern who should bolt upon us but the hated Henley I shook with the broad shame My teeth gnashed curses How willingly could I have  pistoled him Mac Fane every being that eyed me and still more willingly myself  But there was nothing for it but to walk on and seem not to see him He however would not suffer me to depart without a double dose of damnation The same infernal officiousness with which from the first moment he saw me to the last he has been seized came upon him and though I hurried through the Piazza to escape like a perjurer from the pillory he pursued us purposely to inform me I was in company with a rascal and to warn me of my danger  I never can recollect my own situation without an impulse to snatch up the first implement that would deprive me of a consciousness so detestable  The irascible fury of the bully rid me of my tormentor he immediately assaulted Henley and I hastened away from two beings so almost equally abhorrent but from causes so opposite  On the following evening having another appointment with the gambling rascal I took care to have a coach waiting and to go muffled up and disguised as much as possible But for once my caution was superfluous No Mac Fane appeared  Not knowing what had happened and it being night and I thus properly equipped I resolved to drive to his lodgings Being there I sent up my name and was admitted to the bedchamber of this doughty exterminator of men If the temper of my mind  were not obnoxious to all cheerfulness I could almost have laughed the bully was so excellently beaten mortified and enraged His head was bound up his eyes were plaistered his thumb sprained his body of all colours and his mind as hotly fevered as Alexander's itself could have been had Alexander been vanquished at the battle of Issus  His impatience to have Henley in his power is now almost phrensy and it will be phrensy itself when he comes to find as find he will that though he can tie the hands of Henley his conquest must end there and that the prisoner will still defy and contemn his jailor So would I have him Henley though I hate I cannot but respect and admire  The other is a creature I detest myself for ever having known  Yet who but he could have gratified the unabating burning passion of my heart I feel Fairfax as if I had taken my leave of hope joy and human intercourse I have a quarrel with the whole race for having been forced into existence and into misery I have suffered an accumulation of disgrace for which I can never pardon myself And shall I permit the authors of it to live undisturbed in their insult and triumph over me No by hell come of me what will Lower I cannot be in my own esteem than I already am tremble those who made me so  Beating has but rendered this rascal  more impatient and active Every thing is prepared The house is hired aired and provided with a proper guardian The madman keeper has all his implements ready We have now only to watch and catch them at a proper distance from all succour to which in their amorous walks they have frequently strayed  Though even you Fairfax seem to disapprove my conduct I care not Not to give yourself further trouble with what you call such positive prudes might be a very good maxim for you who love your ease too much ever to be sensible of the boiling emotions of a soul like mine You are Guy Fairfax I am Coke Clifton Not but I should have imagined the swelling volumes of  injuries I have communicated would have lighted up a sympathetic flame of retributive vengeance even in you which not all your phlegm could have quenched But no matterThough heaven earth and hell were to face me frowning I would on My purpose is fixed let it but be accomplished and consequences to myself will be the least of all my cares  C CLIFTON  LETTER CXII  COKE CLIFTON TO GUY FAIRFAX  London Dover Street  SINCE the world began never yet had scoundrel wight so many damning accessary incidents to contend with as I have had during the whole progress of this affair All hell seems busy to blacken meI have done the deedThey are secureBut the hour of exultation  itself is embittered and the legitimate triumph of vengeance made to wear the face of basenessI have them but as I tell you there is an event that happened the very moment preceding the seizure which seems to have been contrived by the most malignant of the fiends of darkness purposely to steep me in guilt indelible  After our myrmidons had been three days in vain upon the watch on Friday last Anna and Henley sallied forth about two in the afternoon to take one of their amorous rambles As usual they were followed by Laura who had sent me word of their intention which she had learnt at breakfast time Henley it seems had previously been into the city  A scout was on the watch and when they appeared soon brought the intelligence All was in readiness The keeper with three stout fellows in one party and Mac Fane with four more in another The earliness of their setting out denoted they intended to lengthen their walk The great danger was that it should have been directed to Kensington Gardens as it has been several times lately but in this instance fortune was on our side  They went into the park passed the gardens walked beside the wall crossed the Kensington road and strayed exactly as we could have wished into the fields inclining toward Brompton  I was on horseback and by the help  of a pocket telescope kept them in view without the danger of being seen while they were in the park but as soon as they had left it I thought it necessary to spur on and be ready to prevent any blunders I crossed the road down the lane at the turnpike passed them and saw them arm in arm The sight was insupportable  From what afterward happened they must have seen me too though I imagined myself under cover of the hedge  You know my determination not to be robbed and indeed robbery at such a time and in such a place was a thing I had little reason to expect But a fellow who was lying in ambush at the turn of the lane calculated differently  He imagined nobody to be near and suddenly presented himself and his pistol with a demand of my money  I made a blow at him with the butt end of my whip which missed his head but fell on his shoulder My horse started he fired and missed but sprung suddenly forward and seized hold of the bridle He had another pistol which he was preparing imagining I should be more intimidated when I found him so desperate All this happened immediately after I had passed Anna and Henley and the latter perhaps having seen the fellow and certainly having heard the pistol flew in an instant leaped the hedge and just as the robber was again presenting his pistol made a blow and knocked it out of his hand  The pistol went off and the fellow took to his heels Henley instead of pursuing him stayed to enquire with much earnestness whether I had received any hurt  At this very damning speck of time Fairfax the keeper and his scoundrels who had been dogging them came up There were four of them two before and two behind The undaunted Henley severally knocked down the two fellows in front and in an instant would undoubtedly have been far enough out of all reach but in the very act of striking the second rascal he received a blow from a bludgeon dealt by the bloodhound keeper which levelled him with the earth  Never did my heart feel a twinge  like that moment I thought he was dead He lay motionless notwithstanding which the infernal keeper continued his occupation with unconcern turned the unresisting body over slipped on the straight waistcoat and bound down his arms  At length he gave a groan The instant I heard it I galloped off full speed It was too much for heart to endure  I soon afterward heard him shout for aid more than once but to this they presently put a stop by forcing a gag into his mouth They were not very far distant from the house where he was to be confined and to which he was immediately hurried away  There he at present remains His morning dialogues his noonday walks  and his nightly raptures are ended They are things past never more to return Of that torment at least I have rid myself and others compared to that are bliss ineffable I had sworn it should not be They might have read the oath largely written on my brow and ought instinctively to have known it to be the decree of fate  No Fairfax I never asked a favour from him never by my own consent received one Not all the tortures of all the tyrants the earth ever beheld should have extorted a consent so degrading His repeated interference was but a repetition of insult and as such deserves only to be remembered I asked not life at his hands and giving life instead of a blessing he did but give  torture The gift was detestable and the giver Had I perished he might have been safe and I at rest I asked not charity of him No On any terms I abhor existence but on those darkness and hell are not so hateful It has ulcerated my heart which not even vengeance itself I find has now the power to heal For life I am made miserable but it shall not be a single misery  While the keeper was acting his part of this gloomy drama Mac Fane as you may well imagine was not idle He and his unhallowed scoundrels presently made seizure of the lovely Anna  She stood confused and half terrified at the sudden flight of her enamorato She was more confused more terrified at the sudden appearance of her ravishers I charged the scoundrels on their lives to use her tenderly But what know such hellhounds of tenderness  She made I find a brave and by them unexpected resistance but there were too many of them and it was in vain Mac Fane himself is amazed at her beauty and harangues in his coarse and uncouth jargon on the energy and dignity of her deportment in a manner which shews that even he was awed  They were obliged however forcibly to stop her cries This I imagined would be the case and I had provided  them with a white cambric handkerchief But what will not the touch of such unconsecrated rascals defile  Yes Fairsax they laid their prophane hands on her clasped her in their loathsome arms polluted her with their foul fingers The embrace of a Clifton she might perhaps pardon but this violation she never can  Well then let her add this injury to the rest I know her to be my enemy sworn rooted and irrevocable And why should I tag regret to my sum of wretchedness No I will at least enjoy a moment of triumph however transitory Let her despise me but she shall remember me too  Give me but this brief bliss and there I would wish existence to end That  excepted pleasure there is none for me and of pain I am weary Yes I will glut my soul with this solitary short rapture and contemn the storms that may succeed I fear them not shall glory in them and be glad to find foes if such should arise with whom contention will not be disgrace I wish and seek them Their appearance would give me employment and employment would give me ease and ease would be heaven  C CLIFTON  LETTER CXIII  COKE CLIFTON TO GUY FAIRFAX  London DoverStreet  ALARM has sounded her horn The family is all confusion all doubt hurry fruitless enquiry and indecision The absence of Anna and Henley at dinner threw Mrs Clarke into consternation for Sir Arthur is down at WenbourneHill with old Henley and his  son Edward Each is indulging his dreams of improvement marriage docking of entails and other projects to which I have put an eternal stop  Finding the evening advance and that the two prisoners did not appear the housekeeper sent to the aunt Wenbourne She heard the story and was amazed She knew nothing of them  Ten o'clock came and terror increased A messenger was dispatched to Lord FitzAllen and he could not at first tell whether to be sorry or glad for he did not an instant forget to hope that it was some rascally act on the part of Henley  He sent for the housekeeper She came and he interrogated her The answers she gave did not please him for  the tendency of all his questions was to the disadvantage and crimination of Henley whom she pertinaciously defended She affirmed so positively and so violently that it could not be any plan or evil intention of his that the proud lord was half angry but half obliged to doubt  I took care to be in the way expecting as it happened that a message would be sent to me I immediately attended his lordship and learned all that I have been relating I condoled with him and pretended to pity the family not neglecting to lead his thoughts into the channel that would best serve my purpose and to recapitulate every circumstance I could remember or invent that should induce him to believe Henley and Anna had eloped but affecting candour and  pretending to argue against the possibility of such a supposition  The effect I intended was produced He was fully convinced of Henley's being a low selfish contemptible scoundrel and Anna a forward disobedient insolent miss  I offered my services to pursue them and pressed his acceptance of them violently but was careful to counteract the offer by shewing the impossibility of their being overtaken and by exciting him rather to wish for their escape that Anna might be flagrantly disgraced and his penetration and authority vindicated to the whole world  I did not neglect before the departure of Mrs Clarke to display all my eagerness by sending round to numerous  inns and stablekeepers to enquire whether any postchaise had been hired that should any way accord with the circumstances Other messengers were dispatched by my advice to the different turnpikes and a third set sent off to various watchhouses to enquire whether any intelligence could be obtained of accidental deaths or other mischances  In short I was very diligent to hurry the legs of the servants and the brains of their governors into every direction but the right and thus for a little while in some sort diverted myself with the vagaries of the fools upon whom I was playing One chopfallen runner trod upon the heels of another each with a repetition of his diversified nothings till his lordship thought proper to recollect  it was time for his dignity to retire and not further disturb itself on personages and circumstances so derogatory  In the morning I was careful to be with him again I breakfasted with him and reiterated the same string of doubts conjectures alarms and insinuations  Mrs Clarke returned She had been up all night and her looks testified the distress of her mind She proposed sending an express after Sir Arthur of the propriety of which I endeavoured to make the uncle doubt but she was too zealous and her oratory had too much passion to be counteracted without danger I therefore when I saw resistance vain became the most eager adviser of the measure  There is no merit in imposing upon  stupidity so gross as that of this supercilious blockhead Mrs Clarke would be much more to be feared but that what she may say will be much less regarded Her affection for Anna is extreme and a high proof of the excellent qualities of her mistress  Nor was she one whit less enthusiastic in her praise of Henley Notwithstanding the forbidding frowns and reproofs of his lordship she ran over his whole history and dwelt particularly on an act of benevolence done by him to her niece that being a circumstance that had come immediately within her knowledge She spoke with such a fervour and overflow of heart that she once or twice moved me  She perceived something of the ridiculous  compunction I felt and fell on her knees wrung my hand and adjured me in a tone of very extraordinary emphasis to save her dear her precious young lady I scarcely could recover myself sufficiently to ask her which way it was in my power to save her and to turn the conversation by exclaiming to the peer  Ah Had she but allowed me the happiness and honour of being her protector I think no man would have dared to do her harm  The old housekeeper however continued and began to denounce impending and inevitable evil on the persecutors of Henley and Anna I have no doubt she glanced at me and that her mistress had informed her of the triumph gained over me Why ay I should indeed  have been the scoff of the very rabble had I not taken vengeance for my wrongs  Yet her denunciations seemed prophetic or rather were feeble descriptions of the excruciating pangs by which I am hourly gnawn  I grew weary of the dull farce and put an end to it as speedily as I conveniently could leaving his sage lordship with the full conviction that the sudden disappearance of Henley and his niece could no otherwise be accounted for but by wilful elopement  I am now preparing for a very different visit A visit of vengeance I expect no pleasure no gratification but that alone To prove the danger of injury done to me to punish the perpetrators  to exult at their lamentations and to look down with contempt at all menace or retribution is now my last remaining hope Let me but enjoy this and all other expectation I willingly relinquishI am goingI have them in my graspThey shall feel me now  C CLIFTON  LETTER CXIV  ANNA WENBOURNE ST IVES TO LOUISA CLIFTON  WHERE I am what is to become of me or whether I am ever to see my Louisa more are things of which I am utterly ignorant I write not with an expectation that my friend should read but to memorandum events of which perhaps the world will never hear and  which should this paper by any accident be preserved it will scarcely believe  This vile CliftonSurely I ought never again to call him my Louisa's brotherThis perverse man has grown desperate in error The worst of my forebodings have not equalled his intents His plan has long been mischief Hypocrisy violence rape no means are too foulSuch things are incomprehensible  I am confined in a lone house somewhere behind Knightsbridge I was seized I know not how by a band of ruffians and conveyed hither Every kind of despicable deceit appears to have been practised Frank was decoyed from me He flew once again to save  the life as he thought of this base minded man I know not what is become of him but have no doubt that he like me is somewhere suffering imprisonment if he be permitted yet to live  No thoughts are so tragical no suspicions so horrid as not to be justified by deductions and appearances which are but too probable Yet I will not sink under difficulties nor be appalled at the sight of danger be it death or what else it may That I am in a state of jeopardy my seizure and imprisonment prove That Frank is still in greater peril if still in existence I have just cause to conclude There were pistols fired and one after he leaped the hedge I know not at whom directed  nor what its fateI would if possible ward off apprehension I know it to be folly and I will endeavour to steel my heart against this as well as other mistakes If he be dead or if he be to die grief will not revive or make him invulnerable His own virtue must preserve him or nothing can and in that I will confide  That evil is meant to me it would be absurd to doubt but of what nature where it is to begin or where end that time must disclose For I will not permit myself to imagine the trifling indignities or violence I have hitherto encountered an evil worthy of complaint  'Tis true my arms are bruised and I was rudely dealt with by the vile men  who seized me and that there should be such men is an evil But to me it is none or not worth a thought If I would firmly meet what is to come I must not weakly bewail what is past  I am not immortal neither is my strength infinite but the powers I have I will use We are oftener vanquished because we are fearful than because we are feeble Our debility takes birth in our cowardice and true fortitude is not to be abashed by trifling dangers  I meant to write a narrative but these reflections are forced upon me by my situation I will proceed  I was brought here on Friday ***** by several men of vulgar but ferocious countenances and my maid Laura with me I made all the resistance in my power and the men without any regard to what I suffered in body or mind twisted my arms behind me so that I imagined one of them had been dislocated and forced a handkerchief into my mouth handling tossing and griping me without any respect whatever to decency or pain till they had conveyed me from the fields in which I was walking with Frank Henley to the place where I am  I scarcely can guess at the distance but they hurried me away with great violence crossing several gates and forcing apertures through hedges for  the space I believe of not more than half an hour it might be much less  They brought me to a house walled round into which having been admitted by an old woman they hurried me forward up stairs and shut me into a room decently furnished with a fire in it and a bedchamber adjoining but with the windows barred up and in which every precaution had evidently been taken to render escape impracticable  Laura was shut up with me and there was a slip of paper on the table on which was written  Laura is allowed to fetch whatever you may want Let her ring the bell and the door will be opened  The handwriting was Mr Clifton's  Among other necessaries there was a  bookcase furnished with the works of some of the best authors and a writingdesk with pens ink and paper  The same old woman that opened the gate for the men who brought me constantly comes to open the door for Laura when I ring But this she does with great caution A chain similar to what is common for streetdoors is hung on the outside which she puts up and looks to see that I am not near every time she opens the door The first time she came I stood just behind Laura and in a morose tone she bade me go back or she would lock the door again  After Laura had been several times down stairs I enquired what discoveries she had made and as she informs me  the house appears to have no inhabitants but this old woman and ourselves The old woman resides in the kitchen The doors and windows are all secured and the same care is taken to prevent escape below stairs as above  The food that has been brought us was good and well dressed but almost cold Laura says she is sure it cannot be dressed in the house which is most probable  I communicate but few of my thoughts to Laura because I fear I have good reason to be suspicious of her I have long remarked her partiality in favour of Mr Clifton intermixed with some contradictory appearances which I could not solve at the time but which I now believe to have been aukward attempts  to conceal that partiality and to mislead me which she in part effected  The base designs of Mr Clifton from the nature of them cannot have been very recent and nothing perhaps was more necessary to carry them into execution than the seducing of the woman who by her situation could give him the best intelligence  Since I have begun to doubt her I have purposely crossquestioned her occasionally and she has answered with hesitation and incoherency If however I can perceive the least hope that this letter should be conveyed to the postoffice by any person who may visit the house and whom she may see but I cannot I will trust it to her The trust indeed is nothing for it cannot increase my  peril The persecution of Mr Clifton must prove most pernicious to himself Unless he can deprive me of conscious innocence it can injure me but little  Among other ambiguous circumstances respecting Laura she scarcely seems to repine at her confinement though she has several times affected uneasiness which while she acted it she evidently did not feel Beside she is permitted to stay below and run about the house which whatever caution of bars and bolts may have been used she would not be suffered to do as I should suppose were she really in my interest  About an hour ago we heard the yard  bell ring and the gate open and she was eager to go down I encouraged her and she rung for our turnkey She had seen me writing and without being spoken to took upon her to suppose it was a letter to my Louisa and told me she  did believe  she could get it conveyed to the post I am persuaded this is preconcerted officiousness But as I said I have nothing to lose and there is a bare possibility of hope  When she came up stairs again she told me that the person who had rung at the bell was some man of the neighbourhood who had brought the old woman various trifling articles and whom she had ordered to return at five o'clock with tea and sugar  If contrary to all expectation this  should come to hand Louisa write to my father inform him of all you know and especially write to Mr Clifton It will be ineffectual but write If there be truth in woman I would rejoice to suffer much more mischief than he has the power to inflict could I but by that means restore him to a sense of his own worth or rather of the worth of virtue  Why do I talk of mischief and his power to inflict I hope to shew him he has no power over me and that the strength of men and the force of walls locks and bars are feeble when but resolutely opposed by the force of truth actuating the will of weak and despised womanInjuryPoor depraved mistaken man It is himself he injures  Every effort he makes is but a new assault upon his own peace It is heaping coals of fire upon his own head which it has long been the wish of my heart to exstinguish  Had I but any reason to believe Frank Henley in safety I would not suffer a single sigh to escape me But I know too well Mr Clifton dare not permit him to be at liberty while he keeps me confined Surely nothing can be attempted against his life And yet I sometimes shake with horror There is a reason which I know not whether I dare mention yet if Mr Clifton should think proper to lay snares to intercept and read my letters he ought to be informed of this dangerous circumstance I know not Louisa whether  I am addressing myself to you or him but Frank Henley at the time that I was seized and he likewise as I suppose had bankbills in his possession to the amount of eight thousand pounds  He had been that very morning into the city to receive the money on his father's account and intended as we returned to leave them with Sir Arthur's banker  If men such as those who seized on me were employed for the same violent purpose against him and if they should discover a sum which would to them be so tempting who can say that his life would be safe Frank Henley the preserver of Clifton the preceptor of truth and the friend of man the benevolent magnanimous nobleminded  Frank whose actions were uniform in goodness whose heart was all affection and whose soul all lightand murdered  Why do I indulge a thought so unhuman so impossible It could not beNo no it could not be A supposition so extravagant is guiltYet though I who cannot aid him ought not to encourage such doubts let those who can be warned and be active  I am addressing myself to vacancy No one hears me No one will read what I write  I will be calm It is my situation it is confinement the bars I see and the bolts I hear that inspire these gloomy  thoughts They are unfounded and certainly unavailingHe may have escaped He may at this instant be in search of me Hurrying enquiring despairing and distracted in much deeper distress than I am for were I but sure of his safety I could almost defy misfortune Let not the world lose him Oh If any human creature should in time read this let him hear let him shudder let him beware  Pardon Louisa I do not address myself to you Too well I know my friend to doubt her No cold delay no unfeeling negligence no rash phrensy is to be feared from herAlas What I am writing she will never read It cannot be The man I have to encounter is too practised in deceit  or I should not have been where I am  Well then may he himself read And while he reads thus let his conscience speak  There is a man whose worth and virtues are such that the loss of him would be a loss to the whole human race From this man I received a thousand acts of kindness for which I returned ten thousand insults I repulsed him scorned him struck him and he disregarding the innumerable injuries I had done him but a few hours after plunged headlong down the dreadful abyss to snatch me from the grave I was dead and he gave me life In return I have robbed him of what men prize even more than life of  liberty But if I have put him in jeopardy if I suffer him to remain in the power of hardened and wicked men and if he perish mercy cannot pardon me justice cannot punish and charity itself must hold me in abhorrence  A W ST IVES  LETTER CXV  COKE CLIFTON TO GUY FAIRFAX  London DoverStreet  MY actions are now become one continued chain of artifice But were that all and were not the objects of this artifice of a nature so new and so painful it would afford me amusement and not be any cause of vexation  As it is I feel apprehensions which are wholly different from any I ever felt before To deceive in countries where deception is a pastime authorised practised and applauded is I find something very opposite to what would seem the same thing in this gloomy land of apathy and phlegm There it is a sport and a pleasure Here it is a business of serious danger and general detestation But no matter  I am obliged to watch times and seasons for I have little doubt that I myself am watched That old housekeeper I am sure suspects me and her affection for her mistress is so full so restless that it cannot but sharpen her intellects and make her employ every engine she can imagine for discovery I walked up to  Fozard's as I often do for my horse and I saw one of Sir Arthur's servants pass the yard soon after I entered it I have little doubt but he was dogging me  I got on horseback and rode slowly down toward Pimlico and over Westminster bridge but I saw no more of him  As soon as I was out of town I mended my pace and gradually increased it to a full gallop Passing through Vauxhall I crossed the Thames again at Batterseabridge rode through Chelsea and presently gained the Brompton road  My first visit was to the keeper The fellow has a strange look A villainous physiognomy I enquired after  his prisoner and found he was safe The house is well secured not modern but in the style of the last century strong and heavy and before this affair was thought of had been fitted up for the purposes of confinement but is now still better fortified It has a garden which is surrounded by a high wall in which the prisoner is suffered to exercise himself but not without the very necessary precaution of confining his arms in the strait waistcoat securing the doors and attentively watching his motions  I ordered the fellow to see that Henley wanted for nothing to let a boy he has wait upon him and to keep out of his way himself for two reasons of my own I do not wish Henley to suffer the insults of such a vulgar and narrowsouled  rascal my revenge is of a nobler kind Neither am I quite certain that this keeper hardened obdurate and pitiless as he is could withstand Henley's oratory At least I would not willingly have him subjected to the temptation though the fellow is so averse to any sense of human pity that I think the danger is very small  He was offended however at my thinking proper to direct him and surlily told me he understood his trade  Here I met Mac Fane by appointment He cannot forget the disgrace of Coventgarden and spoke of Henley with a degree of malignity that would want but little encourageing to become dangerous I am to pay him the thousand pounds in a few days and our  place of rendezvous is then to be once more at the Shakespeare  I was glad to escape from the company of these new inmates of mine these firstborn of Beelzebub and to fly to my other prisoner I say fly for I set out with eagerness enough but every step I took I felt my ardour abate The houses are more than half a mile apart and I thought proper to go thither on foot and not to take any common path but to cross the fields as the securest mode  Laura knew I was to be there and had her tale ready She presently came down I enquired after her mistress and if her account be true this heroic woman has not shed a tear but has behaved  with all her apparent customary calm She is a divine creature  As I rode along I made a thousand determinations that all should be that day ended I cursed myself pledged my honour used every method which might have shewn me how much I doubted my own resolution to prove to myself how irrevocably determined I was The little remaining firmness I had left wholly died away at the relation of Laura  I must stay till the calm dignity of her mind shall begin to decline The nature of her confinement the fears she cannot but have for her Henley the recollection of her friends and father and her apprehensions of me must all  quickly contribute to produce this effect  I do not pretend to deny that I feel a reluctance to a first interview but I am determined the first shall be the only one I know myself and know when once I am heated it will not then be Anna St Ives a miracle though she be that can overawe or conquer me I have the stubbornness of woman and the strength of man I am reckless of what is to follow but the thing shall be There is not a particlè in my frame that does not stand pledged to the deed by honour and oath It is the only event for which I care or for which I live  Nor shall I live long when once it is over I foresee I shall not But that  is not a painful no it is a satisfactory thought I would even present her the pistol would she but dispatch me the moment my revenge is gratified I would then sleep and forget all that is and all that might have been  She has been writing I knew it would be one source of amusement to her and I provided her with implements Laura asked and she owned it was a letter to my sister which she could wish were sent But that must not be She means to give it to Laura I of course shall be the next receiver  This girl Laura acts her part ill She is not half sorrowful enough I wonder Anna does not remark it and Laura says she does not though that is no very good proof The complexion  of her letter I think will tell me how far she does or does not confide in her maid I know she holds suspicion in contempt and yet I think my high opinion of her discrimination would find some abatement were I certain that she did not suspect this shallow girl  My soul burns to have it over And yet like a coward I refrain But I will not long submit to such contemptible qualms I will not continue to be diffident of myself for it is that only by which I am withheld Not a single wrong is forgotten I repeat them in my sleep Ay Fairfax such sleep as I have is nothing but a repetition of them and a rehearsal of the revenge by which they are to be appeased I will return tomorrow  or perhaps next day and then You shall then hear more from  C CLIFTON  END OF VOLUME VI
