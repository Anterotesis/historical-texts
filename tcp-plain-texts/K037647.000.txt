I look where around me so gay  I'd a pleasure in toiling  While Patrick was smiling  The sun shin'd tho 'twas cloudy the while we made hay  For den Pat and I had not parted  Each bird while it's singing may shut up it's throat  I wont look at the thistle  Where goldfinches whistle  For tho' they all stun me I don't hear a note  How can I while thus brokenhearted  The cows may courant it the sheep frisk and play  Lambs and kidlings be dancing  And skipping and prancing  For tho' they're before me they're all gone away  Since Patrick and Unah are parted  Exit  Trim  All matters being now

a gentleman for whom you seem to have an esteem he asks your hand Speak for yourself Mr Scandaroon  Scan  Why Madam you see I have but little to say I have seen all the world and men and manners and everything and every body I want to marry Miss My way is to make but few words about any thing  Estel  In one word daughter what do you think of my friend for a husband  Cleo  I am proud of your choice Madam I thank the gentleman for his good opinion of me and yet if I marry him you know I shall leave you  Estel  My sweet girl I brought thee up It was a delicious task but were you even to

time I can't press her Madam I have not the language of a lover for I make but few words about any thing  Estel  Yes but I want to see her chearful When I was of her age  AIR  Gay as the lark that early soaring  Views from on high the glittering streams  And while his oraisons are pouring  Basks in Phoebus' chearing beams  II  I knew at morning nought but pleasure  Noon never came to see me grieve  Nor did delight far beyond measure  E'er fail to greet my steps at eve  Exeunt  Estella  and  Scandaroon  Glan  My angel my Cleora one single word for Heaven's sake  Cleo  Not for the worldI'll see you in the meadowI have much to tell you  Going off  Glan  Exquisite sounds    To  Trim  who comes on    I've seen my angel Trim She spoke to me I heard her sing and listen'd with the same rapture as a blest soul attends to the voice of the seraph that wings it's way to heaven  AIR  When on Cleora's form I gaze  Surveying that exhaustless store  Till then unnotic'd charms I praise  And those till then prais'd I adore  And while I look with fond surprize  And catch soft madness from my fair  I wish for Argus' hundred eyes  And wish to gaze for ever there  II  But when Cleora's voice I hear  And when she strikes the trembling strings  I wish each eye was made an ear  To list with angels while she sings  Thus while in rapture they rejoice  My senses still her empire own  And touch her see her hear her voice  All all confirm me her's alone  Exit  Enter  Pickle Goody Muzzy  and  Unah  Trim  My master's in a rare rapturous humourOh here come my associatesWell good people

shrivell'd hand  He fumbles  And mumbles  How can I withstand  With asthmatic lungs when he fetches a sigh  And grins in rheumatics to make me comply  How can I at such tender extasy scoff  That protests in an ague and vows in a cough  Exit  Trim  Well said Goody The old girl has some spirit yet Oh here comes John halfseas over i'faithAh Measter you have been at the barrel  Muz  Ah what

you mean by that  Trim  Mean that I can sing your song to another guess  ort of burden  When Goody Muzzy's in a pout  And scolds and storms and fleers and jaunts  Only to send her husband out  That

there are two things to be done to bring Muzzy to his firesideand you little Unah to mine  Unah  Why perhaps it might be warmer than Old Congo's but I am afraid it would sooner grow cold your's would
