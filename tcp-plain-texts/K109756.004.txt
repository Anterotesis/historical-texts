Linn  Serinus Canarius  Briss Ray Will and Kolb  Passere di Canaria  Zinn  Canarien Vogel  Wirs  IF the Nightingale be the songster of the grove the Canary Finch is the musician of the chamber The melody of the former is derived from Nature alone that of the latter is directed and improved by our instructions With a weaker voice with less extent of modulation with less variety of notes the Canary Finch has a finer ear greater facility of imitation  The Canary learns to speak and articulate many little names very distinctly By means of a flageolet it can acquire two or three airs which it chants in their proper tone always keep∣ing due time c  Traité des Serius des Canaries par Hervieux    A Canary which when young was placed very near my desk got an odd sorc of song it imitated the sound made by telling crowns  Note communicated by Hebert receiver general at Dijon  and  a more retentive memory and as the charac∣ters of animals depend principally on the quality of their perceptions this delicate bird alive to every impression becomes also more social more gentle forms acquaintance and even shews attachment  It becomes so familiar and so fond of caressing that a thousand and a thousand times it comes to kiss and bill its master and never sails to answer his call  Traité des Serins par M Hervieux  Its caresses are amiable its little pets are innocent and its anger neither hurts nor offends Its habits too approach nearer to our own it feeds on grain like the other do∣mestic birds it is more easily bred than the Nightingale which lives only on flesh and in∣sects and which requires its meals to be pur∣posely prepared Its education is attended also with greater success it readily lays aside the me∣lody of its native airs to adopt the harmony of our voices and instruments it eagerly follows the notes and improves and heightens their delicacy The Nightingale proud of its independent warble seems desirous to preserve its purity at least he slights our music and can hardly be brought to learn a few songs The Canary Finch prattles or whistles but the Nightingale despises what he deems the perversion of his talents and perpetually recurs to the rich beauties of Nature  His evervaried song can never be altered by man that of the Canary Finch is more pliant and can be modelled by our taste The one therefore contributes more than the other to the comforts of society the Canary Finch sings at all times recreates our spirits in the gloomiest weather and even adds to our happiness it amuses all young people and is the delight of the recluse it relieves the languors of the cloister and infuses cheerfulness into innocent and captive minds and its little loves which are manifest when it breeds have a thousand and a thousand times awakened the tenderness of feeling hearts It is as useful as the Vulture is pernicious  To the happy climate of the Hesperides this charming bird owes it birth or at least its per∣fection for in Italy  Citrinilla  Gesner  Vercellino  Olina  "Sparrow variegated above with yellowish green below dilute greenish the wing and tail quills blackish the outer margin greenish"  The Italian  Serin  BRISSON It is the  Fringilla Citrinella  of Linnaeus and the  Citril Finch  of Latham Its specific character  "It is some∣what greenish its back spotted with dusky its legs flesh co∣loured"  there is a species smaller than that of the Canaries and in Provence another almost as large  Serinus Serin Cenicle Ceresin Cinit Cedrin  "Sparrow varying above with greenish yellow below dilute greenish the sides marked with dusky longitudinal spots a greenish yellow stripe on the wings the quills of the wings and of the tail dusky above the outer margins grayishgreen the tips whitish"  The  Serin  BRISSON It is the  Fringilla Serinus  of Linnaeus and the  Serin Finch  of Latham Its specisic character  "It is somewhat but both these are greenish its lower mandible whitish its back and sides spotted with dusky a yellow spot on the wings"  but both of these are  more rustic and may be regarded as the wild branches of a polished stem All the three in∣termix in the state of captivity but in the range of nature each propagates in its peculiar climate They are therefore permanent varieties and ought to be distinguished by separate names The largest was called  Cinit  or  Cini  in the time of Belon above two centuries ago and in Pro∣vence it is termed at present  Cini  or  Cigni  and the Italian kind  Venturon  I shall distinguish these three varieties by the epithets  Canary Cini  and  Venturon  The  Venturon  or the Italian Bird is found not only through the whole of Italy but in Greece  The ancient Greeks called this bird  and the modern Greeks according to Belon  The Turkish name is  Sare  in some parts of Italy it is termed  Luguarinera Beagana Raverin  in the neighbourhood of Rome  Verzellino  in Bologna  Vidarino  at Naples  Lequilla  at Genoa  Scarino  in the Trentin  Citrinella  in Germany  Citrynle  or  Zitrynle  at Vienna  Citril  Turkey Austria Provence Languedoc Catalo∣nia and probably in all climates of that temper∣ature Some years however it is very rare in the southern provinces of France and particu∣larly at Marseilles Its song is pleasant and varied The female is inferior to the male both in the charms of its notes and in the beauty of its plumage The shape the colour the voice and the food of the Venturon and of the Canary are nearly the same and the only difference is  that the Italian bird is sensibly smaller and its warble neither so clear nor so melodious  The  Cini  or Green Bird of Provence is larger than the Venturon and its tones are much fuller It is distinguished by the beauty of its colours the loudness of its song and the variety of its notes The female which is ra∣ther larger than the male and has fewer yellow feathers chants not like its mate and answers only in monosyllables It feeds on the smallest seeds it can find in the field lives long in a cage seems fond of lodging with a goldfinch whose accents it seems attentively to hear and adopt to vary its own warble It occurs not only in Provence but also in Dauphiné in the Lyonnois  I have seen in the country in Bugey and near Lyons birds very like the Canary Finches and they were called  Signis  or  Cignis  I have also seen them at Geneva in cages and their song did not seem to me very pleasantI think they are called at Paris "the Swiss Serins"  Note of  M HEBERT  "The German Serins are much commended they excel the Canary Finches by their beauty and their song They are not Inclined to grow fat the force and extent of their warble prevent it is said that effect They are raised in cages or in chambers fitted up for them and having an easterly aspect they hatch thrice ayear from the month of April to August"  Le Parfait Oiseleur  This is not altogether accurate for the song of these German Serins which are the same with those of Switzerland and Provence though full and shrill is far from having the sweetness and mellow∣ness of the Canary Birds  in Bugey in Geneva in Switzer∣land in Germany in Italy and in Spain  In Catalonia it is called  Canari de Montanya  in Italy  Serin  or  Scarzerin  in Germany  Faedeule  in the neighbourhood of Vienna  Hirngryll  in Switzerland  Schwederle  It  is the same bird that is called in Burgundy the  Serin  it builds among the osiers planted along the sides of the rivers and its nest is lined with hair and cased with moss This bird which is pretty common in the vicinity of Marseilles and in the south of France as high as Burgundy is unfrequent in the northern provinces Lottin∣ger says it is only migratory in Lorraine  The prevailing colour of the Venturon as well as that of the Cini is a green yellow on the upper part of the body and a yellow green on the belly but the Cini larger than the Venturon is distinguished by the brown colour which appears in longitudinal spots on the sides of the body and in waves below  I shall here insert an excellent description of the Cini which M Hebert sent to me  "This bird is somewhat smaller than the Canary Finch which it much resembles It has precisely the same plumage with a kind of Canary called the  Gray Canary  which is perhaps the original bird and the varieties are owing to domes∣tication  "The forepart of the head the orbits of the eyes the underpart of the head a sort of collar the breast and belly as far as the toes are of a jonquilcolour with a tinge of green The sides of the head and the higher part of the wings are mixed with green jonquil and black The back and the rest of the wings are dashed with green gray and black The rump is jonquil The breast though of a single colour is waved The spots scattered on the plumage of the Cini are not distinctly marked but run into each other those on the head are much finer and like points on the two sides of the breast and under the belly parallel to the wings are spots or streaks of black  "The tail is forked consisting of twelve quills the wings are of the same colour with the back the ends of the coverts at the origin of the great quills are slightly edged with a sort of dull yel∣low the great quills and the tail are similar and of a brown ver∣ging to black with a slight edging of gray the tail is shorter than that of the Canary bird  "In general this bird is jonquil below and variegated on the back with different colours in which the green predominates though we cannot assert that this is the ground colour on the back not a single feather but is variegated with several colours  "The bill is pretty much like that of the Canary but rather shorter and smaller the upper mandible is level with the crown of the head has little concavity broader at its base and scalloped near its origin the lower mandible is more concave placed dia∣gonally under the upper into which it is encased  "This Cini was only two inches and seven lines from the top of the head to the origin of the tail which was only one inch and ten lines the wings extend to the third of the tail the legs are very slender the tarsus six lines long and the toes near as much the nails are not regularly hooked"  whereas in  our climate the common colour of the Canary is uniform and of a citronyellow on all the body and even on the belly it is only the tips of the feathers however that are tinged with that delicate hue the rest of them being entirely white The female is of a paler yellow than the male but this citroncolour verging more or less on white which the Canary assumes in our climate is not the tint of its native climate for it varies according to the different tempera∣tures  "I have observed" says one of our most intelligent naturalists "that the Canary Finch which becomes entirely white in France is in Teneriffe of almost as deep a gray as the lin∣net this change of colour is owing probably to the coldness of our climate"  The colour can be varied also by the difference of food by confinement and above all by the mixture of  breeds In the beginning of this century the cu∣rious in birds reckoned already twentynine va∣rieties of Canaries and all of them were distinctly described  I shall here enumerate them all beginning with those which are most common  The Common Gray Canary  The Gray Canary with down and white feet  Variegated breed  The Whitetailed Canary  Varie∣gated breed  The Common Flaxen Canary  The Flaxen Canary with red eyes  The Golden Flaxen Canary  The Flaxen Canary with down  Variegated breed  The Whitetailed Flaxen Canary  Variegated breed  The Common Yellow Canary  The Yellow Canary with down  Variegated breed  The Whitetailed Yellow Canary  Variegated breed  The Common Agate Canary  The Agate Canary with red eyes  The Whitetailed Agate Canary  Variegated breed  The Agate Canary with down  Variegated breed  The Common Pink Canary  The Pink Canary with red eyes  The Golden Pink Canary  The Pink Canary with down  Variegated breed  The White Canary with red eyes  The Common Variegated Canary  The Variegated Canary with red eyes  The Flaxen Variegated Canary  The Flaxen Variegated Canary with red eyes  The Black Variegated Canary  The Jonquilblack Variegated Ca∣nary with red eyes  The Jonquilblack Variegated Ca∣nary of a regular plumage  The Full Canary that is entirely of a jonquilyellow which is the rarest  The Crest Canary or rather the Crowned which is one of the most beautiful  Traité des Serins de Canaries par Hervieux    The primitive stock from which these were descended is the Common Gray Ca∣nary All those which have other uniform colours derive them from the difference of climates Those which have red eyes are more or less inclined to a pure white plumage and the va∣riegated are rather artificial than natural  "The shades and arrangement of the colours of the Varie∣gated Canaries differ exceedingly some are black on the head others not some are spotted irregularly and others with great re∣gularity The differences of colour are commonly perceived only on the upper part of the bird they consist of two large black spots on each wing the one before and the other behind in a large cres∣cent of the same colour placed on the back pointing its concavity towards the head and joining by its horns to the two anterior black spots of the wings Lastly the tail is surrounded behind by an halfcollar of gray which seems to be a compound colour re∣sulting from the intimate mixture of black and yellow The tail and its coverts are almost white"  Description des Couleurs d'un Canari Panaché observé avec M de  MONTBEILLARD    But besides these primary varieties which seem to have been introduced by the change of climate and some secondary ones that have since appeared there are others more apparent and which result from the union of the Canary with the Venturon and with the Cini for not only do these three birds breed together but the young hybrids are capable of procreation The same may be said in regard to the fruits of the commerce of the Canary with the Siskin with the Goldfinch with the Linnet with the Yellowhammer with the Chaffinch and even it is said with the Sparrow  D'Arnault assured Salerne that he saw at Orleans a gray hen Canary which had escaped from the volery couple with a sparrow and make her hatch in a  sparrowcan  which thrived  Amusemens Innocens on le Parfait Oiseleur    These birds though very different from each other and apparently discri∣minated widely from the Canaries can by pro∣per care and attention be made to pair with them The Canary must be removed from those of its own species and the experiment seems to succeed better when performed with the female than with the male The Siskin and Goldfinch are the only birds with which it is  well ascertained that the male Canary can pro∣pagate On this subject one of my friends thus writes me a person of as much experience as veracity  Father Bougot    "For thirty years past I have raised many of these small birds and have paid particular atten∣tion to breeding them I can therefore from long observation assert the following facts When we wish to pair Canaries with Goldfinches we must take the Goldfinches at ten or twelve days old and put them in the nest with Canaries of the same age we must raise them together in the same volery and accustom them to the same food It is usual to lodge the male Goldfinches with the female Canaries and they associate much more readily than if the female Gold∣finches were joined with the male Canaries We may observe however that the union is more tardy because the Goldfinch is later in pairing than the Canary on the contrary if the female Goldfinch be placed beside the male Canary they sooner couple  This proves as we shall afterwards observe that the female is not so much stimulated to love by nature as roused by the solici∣tation of the male  To succeed we must never admit the male Canary into the voleries where there are female Canaries for he would then prefer them to Goldfinches  Gesner says that a Swiss birdcatcher trying to pair a cock Canary with a hen  Sarzerine  Cini had eggs but that these were addle  "  "With regard to the union of the male Ca∣nary with the female Siskin I am certain that it succeeds well I have kept for nine years in my volery a female Siskin which never failed to make three hatches annually for the first five years though the number was reduced to two in the four following years I have other Sis∣kins which have bred with the Canaries with∣out being raised or kept separately We need only leave the male or female Siskin in the chamber with a good number of Canaries and we shall perceive them pair with the Canaries at the same time that these pair with each other whereas to succeed with the Goldfinches they must be shut up in a cage with the Canary and every bird of the same species must be excluded The Siskin lives as long as the Canary and eats the same food with much less reluctance than the Goldfinch  "I have also put Linnets with Canaries but there is seldom success unless we lodge the male Linnet with the female Canary for the hen Linnet makes no nest but drops her eggs in the cage and these are generally addle I have made the experiment with them having placed them under female Canaries and frequently found that they did not hatch  "It is very difficult to pair Chaffinches and Yellowhammers with Canaries I have kept for three years a female Yellowhammer with a male Canary and it has laid only addle  eggs This has also been the case with the female Chaffinch but when the female Canary is covered by the male Chaffinch and Yellow∣hammer she has prolific eggs"  From these facts and some others which I have collected it appears that the Siskin is the only bird of which the male and female propa∣gate equally with those of the male or female Canaries The female Canary also breeds rea∣dily with the Goldfinch not so easily with the cock Linnet and even produces though with more difficulty under the male Chaffinches Yel∣lowhammers and Sparrows whereas the male Canaries cannot impregnate the females of these last Nature is therefore more uniform and permanent in the male than in the female in the former the characters are deeply imprinted in the latter the qualities are modified by the influence of external causes In the few experi∣ments which I have made on the union of some contiguous species of quadrupeds I observed that the ewe easily bred under the hegoat but that the ram could not propagate upon the shegoat I have been told of an instance in which a stag covered a cow but the bull has been known to copulate with the hind The mare breeds more readily with the jackass than the sheass with the stallion In general mules par∣take more of the characters of the female than of the male whose features are more strongly markedThese facts correspond with those we  have mentioned with regard to the crossbreed of birds It is evident that the female Canary is much more related than the male to the species of the Yellowhammer of the Linnet of the Chaf∣finch and of the Sparrow since it breeds with all these while the male will not I use the term  will  for perhaps it is only from a want of resolution that the female yields to the solicita∣tions of those of a different species however an examination of the products of this inter∣mixture affords conclusions that agree with all that I have said of the generation and develope∣ment of animals and as the subject is import∣ant I shall here state the principal facts  The first variety which seems to constitute two distinct families in the species consists of the variegated Canaries and those whose plu∣mage is uniform The white sort or the yel∣lowcitron are never variegated only when the latter are four or five years old the tips of the wings and of the tail become white The gray kind are not of an uniform colour some feathers are affected by different shades and some individuals are of a lighter or of a darker tinge The agate is spread uniformly though it varies in the intensity The pink coloured are more similar the tint being uniform not only in different individuals but in different parts of the same individual In those which consist of several colours the Yellow Jonquil sort are varie∣gated with blackish and are commonly black on  the head In some Canaries the plumage is tinctured with all the simple colours which we have mentioned but the Yellow Jonquil are the most variegated with black  When Canaries are paired of an uniform colour that of their young is also uniform If both parents are gray for instance the progeny is also commonly gray and this is the case with the pink with the white with the yellow and with the agate If the parents be of different colours the fruits of their commerce will have a richer plumage and as the combinations that can take place are numerous an immense va∣riety of tints may be produced But when the Canaries of an uniform colour are crossed with those which are variegated the changes are pro∣digiously multiplied and there is scarce any limit to the sportive modifications Nay it often happens that parents of an uniform colour have beautiful variegated offspring derived from the mixture of shades in themselves or their progenitors  To have beautiful birds we must pair the flaxen variegated male with a whitetailed yellow female or at least a variegated male with a whitetailed flaxen female or any other female that is whitetailed except only the gray And when we want to ob∣tain a fine Jonquil we should set a black variegated male with a whitetailed yellow female  Amusemens Innocens    With respect to the intercourse of the Canary with birds of other species I shall here state the observations which I have collected Of all  the Canaries the Cini or Green Canary has the strongest voice and appears to be the most vi∣gorous and the most ardent in propagation it is sufficient for three female Canaries and while they are sitting in the nests it supplies them and their young with food The Siskin and the Goldfinch are neither so powerful nor so assidu∣ous and a single female Canary satisfies their appetite  The crossbreed of the Cini of the Siskin and of the Goldfinch with the hen Canary are stronger than the Canaries sing longer and their notes are fuller and more sonorous but they are slower in receiving instruction for the most part they whistle imperfectly and seldom one can be found that can repeat a single air com∣plete  When we wish to have a breed of the Goldfinch with the hen Canary the former should be two years old and the latter one for the Canary arrives sooner at maturity It will be better if both be reared together though that precaution is not absolutely necessary and the Author of "the Treatise on Canaries" is mis∣taken in asserting that the hen must never have had commerce with a male of her own species and that this would prevent her from receiving those of a different kind The following fact is directly contrary to this opinion  "I hap∣pened" says Father Bougot "to put twelve Ca∣naries together four males and eight females  Bad chickweed killed three of these males and all the females lost their first hatch In the stead of these CockCanaries I thought of substitut∣ing three male Goldfinches which I caught and put them into the volery in the beginning of May I had towards the end of July two nests of young which thrived as well as possible and in the following year I had three hatches of each cock Goldfinch with the female Ca∣naries These commonly do not breed with the Goldfinch except from the age of one to four while they continue prolific with their own males till eight or nine and it is only the variegated female that breeds with the Goldfinch after its fourth year We must never put the Goldfinch into a volery for it demo∣lishes the nests and breaks the eggs of the other birds"  It appears then that the hen Canaries though accustomed to the commerce of their own species listen to the invitation of the male Goldfinches and submit without reluctance to their embraces The union is even as pro∣ductive as with their proper mates since they have three hatches ayear with the Goldfinch The case is different in the intercourse of the cock Linnet with the Canary there being com∣monly but one hatch and very seldom two in the year  The progeny of the Canaries with the Siskins with the Goldfinches c are prolific and can breed not only with both the species from which  they sprung but likewise with each other and thus may perpetuate an endless variety  Sprengel has made many observations with regard to the crossbreeds of the Canaries with other species and particularly with the Goldfinches he has shewn that the progeny continued to propagate with each other and with the parent races The proof which he has adduced is complete though before him these hybrids were considered as sterile  Amusemens Innocens  We must own however that the fruits of the inter∣mixture in these hybrids are far from being so certain or so numerous as in the pure species they generally have only one hatch ayear sel∣dom two their eggs are often addle and the success depends on many minute circumstances which it would be impossible to observe and still less to describe with precision It is said that in these there are always more males than females  "A hen Canary says Father Bougot and a Goldfinch have in the same year at three different times laid me nineteen eggs which all hatched and of the young were only three females"  It would be proper to ascertain this fact by repeated observations In the pure breeds of several birds as in the partridges it has also been remarked that the males exceed the females The same remark applies to the human race in our climates seventeen boys are born for six∣teen girls We know not the precise propor∣tion between the male and female partridges but that the former are more numerous than the latter we are certain because in the pairing  season there are always cock birds that want mates It is likely however that sixteen to three as in the crossbreed of the Canary and Gold∣finch is a greater inequality than ever takes place in a pure breed I have been told that the she∣mules got between the ass and the mare exceed in number the hemules but I could never ob∣tain accurate information on that subject Our business then is to determine by observation the number of males and of females in the pure race of the Canary and afterwards to examine if that of the males be still greater in the cross∣breed of the Goldfinch and hen Canary What disposes me to entertain this opinion is that the character of the male is in general more deeply impressed on the progeny than that of the fe∣male These hybrids which are stronger than the Canaries and have a louder voice are also longer lived But there is an observation which applies alike to all that the period of their lives is abridged by their ardour in propagation A cock Canary raised by itself and without inter∣course with the female lives generally thirteen or fourteen years and the crossbreed of the Gold∣finch will reach its eighteenth or nineteenth year The crossbreed of the Siskin if kept apart from the females live fifteen or sixteen years Whereas the cock Canary which has one or several females seldom lives longer than ten or eleven years the crossbreed of the Siskin eleven  or twelve and that of the Goldfinch fourteen or fifteen It is also necessary to part them from the females after the time of hatching that is from the month of August to that of March else the heat of their passion would waste them and abridge their lives by two or three years  To these remarks which are all interesting we may subjoin a general and more important observation which may throw some light on the generation of animals and the developement of their different parts It has been constantly noticed in the copulation of the Canaries both with those of their own species and with those of other races that the offspring resembled the father in the head the tail and the legs and the mother in the rest of the body The same has been observed in quadrupeds The mule got between the jackass and the mare has the thick body of the former and the ears the tail and the thin legs of the latter It appears therefore that in the mixture of the two seminal liquors how∣ever intimate we suppose it to be the organic molecules furnished by the female occupy the centre of that living sphere which increases in all dimensions and that the molecules injected by the male surround and inclose these so that the extremities of the body proceed more im∣diately from the father than from the mother The skin the hair the colours which may be considered as the exterior of the body retain most of the paternal impressions In the cross∣breed  which I obtained from the copulation of the hegoat with the ewe they all had instead of a soft fleece the shaggy coat of the male In the human species we may generally perceive that the son resembles the father more than the mother in his legs his feet and his hands in his writing in the quantity and colour os his hair in his complexion and in the bulk of his head and the mulattoes born of a negress lose more of the dark tinge than those of a white woman All these facts seem to confirm our general idea that the female molecules occupy the centre of the  foetus  and though brought into the closest union are more abundant near the surface  In general the beauty of the species can never be improved or even preserved without crossing the breed and the elegance of form the strength and vigour of the body depend almost solely on the proportion of the limbs Accordingly it is the males alone which in man and in the animals ennoble the race Large generous mares covered by sorry little horses have always ill∣made colts but a fine stallion will get a beauti∣tiful progeny from even the ugliest mares and the more dissimilar are the kinds of the parents the handsomer will be the offspring The same may be said of sheep the breed is always improv∣ed by strange rams while the ordinary small sort can never get good lambs from the most excel∣lent ewes I could enlarge upon this important  subject but I should make too long a digression Yet to detail all the facts respecting the inter∣mixture of animals would be the most real service that can be rendered to Natural History As many people employ or amuse themselves in breeding Canaries which requires little time numerous experiments might be made by cross∣ing them and continuing to mix the fruits of the embrace I am confident that by combin∣ing these observations with those upon the qua∣drupeds and upon man we might be able to estimate the precise influence of the male in ge∣neration compared with that of the female and consequently from the general relations to pro∣nounce whether such a male would suit such a female c  But in the quadrupeds as well as in man and in the small birds the difference of the moral qualities often disturbs the correspondence of the physical properties If any thing could prove that the character of the individual is an original impression of nature which education can never alter it is an instance in the Canaries  "They almost always" says Hervieux "differ from each other in their tempers some males are always sad and as it were absorbed in re∣veries generally bloated and sing but sel∣dom in a mournful tone require an immense time to learn are imperfectly ac∣quainted with what they are taught and easily forget it These Canaries are often so slo∣venly  that their feet and tail are always dirty they never gain the affection of their females which they soothe not with their song while engaged in hatching and the young are little better than their fathers There are other Canaries which are so wicked that they kill the female the only way to succeed is to give them two females which will unite in their common defence and after subduing their mate by force they will retain the do∣minion by love  "Sometimes the pravity of their disposition is in a certain measure compensated by other qualities such for instance as their melodious song their beautiful plumage and their familiar turn If you would wish to make them breed you must give them two strong females one year older than themselves and the fe∣males should be accustomed for several months previous to live in the same cage that they may have no jealousy to each other And a month before the loveseason they must be both set together in the breeding cage and at the proper time the male should be let in among them He will be very quarrelsome the first three days but the females uniting against him will certainly in the end gain the ascendant and he will be obliged to submit and at last become attached to them These kind of forced marriages often succeed better than others from which more might be expected To preserve the hatch the first egg should be removed and an ivory one put in its place the same must be done the following days always taking them away as fast as they are laid lest the male should break them and after the last egg is dropped the male must be shut in a separate cage and the female permitted to hatch undisturbed After the young are ready to be taken from the mother the prisoner may be returned to his female"  Traité des Serins des Canaries  Others are of a disposi∣tion so barbarous that they break the eggs and eat them or if these have escaped their ferocity they lay hold of the callow brood by  the bill drag them into the cage and murder them  "There are males of a weak habit indifferent about the females and always sick after nestling these must not be paired for I observe that the offspring resemble the father There are others so libidinous that they drive the female from her nest and would not allow her to sit these are of a hardy constitution have a superior song a finer plumage and are tamer Others break the eggs and kill the young the more to enjoy the female Others shew a predilection for an individual and will out of twenty select their favourite to which they will pay particular attention Those have a good temper and will communicate it to their progeny Others discover fondness for no female and remain inactive and unproductive The same difference of character and tempera∣ment are to be found in the females The jonquil females are most gentle the agate sort are capricious and often desert their young to join the male the variegated females are assiduous on their eggs and affectionate to their young but the variegated males are the most ardent of all the Canaries and must have two or three females else they will drive them from the nest and break the eggs Those which are entirely jonquil have nearly the same fire of tem∣per and require two or three females The agate males are the feeblest and the females of that kind often expire upon their eggs"  Note communicated by Father  BOUGOT  "  Some are so wild and independent that they will not suffer themselves to be touched or caressed and can neither be governed nor treat∣ed like the rest they spurn at the least interfer∣ence and it is only when left to the impulse of their humours that they will couple and breed Others are excessively indolent the gray for instance scarcely ever take the pains to build a nest but it must be provided for them c All these characters are we see very different from each other and from those of our favourite Canaries which are ever joyous and ever chanting are  so tame and so lovely are excellent husbands and affectionate fathers are of so mild a tem∣per and of so happy a disposition that they re∣ceive every generous impression and glow with each exalted feeling They continually amuse the female by their song they sooth the languor of her occupation they entreat her to take re∣lief in hatching and in her place they sit se∣veral hours every day they also feed the young and lastly receive whatever instructions are given From these alone we are to judge of the species and I mention the others only to shew that even in animals the temper is de∣rived from nature and not formed by edu∣cation  Moreover the apparently wicked disposition which drives them to break their eggs and kill their young proceeds often from the fire of their amorous passions To enjoy the female oftener and riot in the fulness of pleasure they plunder the nest and destroy the dearest objects of their affection The best way to breed from these birds is to separate them and put them in the cage it will be much better to give them a chamber having a sunny aspect and facing the east in winter For in the cage they will break the eggs to repeat their embrace but when they are lodged in an apartment where there are more females than males they will pay their addresses to another and allow the first to hatch undis∣turbed Besides the males from jealousy will  not suffer disorders to be committed and when one is prompted by ardor to tease his female and break her eggs they give him a sound beating sufficient to mortify his concupiscence  The materials given to build their nest are the scrapings of fine linen rags cows and stags hair useless for other purposes moss and slender dry stalks of hay The Goldfinches and Siskins when lodged with the hen Canaries to obtain a crossbreed make use of the moss and hay but the Canaries prefer the hair and lint but these must be well divided lest the fibres sticking to their feet should occasion the eggs to be broken  To feed them a crib is placed in the chamber which is pierced all round with holes that admit the head and into it a portion of this mixture is put three pints of rapeseed two of oats two of millet and lastly a pint of hemp seed and the crib is replenished every twelve or thirteen days taking care that the grains be well cleaned and winnowed This food is proper when they are only sitting but the day before the young are excluded from the shell the parents ought to have a dry cake baked without salt and after eating it they should have hard boiled eggs one being sufficient for two males and four fe∣males and two for four males and eight females and so on in proportion They ought to have no sallad or greens while rearing the offspring for this would weaken much the young But to vary somewhat their diet they should every  three days be presented on a plate with a bit of white bread soaked in water and squeezed in the hand this being not so rich as the cake and preventing them from growing too fat while breeding It would also be proper to give them a few Canary seeds  Alpis  in French the Canarygrass being termed  Alpiste  It is the  Phalaris Canariensis  of Linuaeus It is a native of the Canary islands whence it springs spontaneously in the corn fields but is now cultivated in small qu ntities in many parts of Europe  but only once in two days lest they be heated too much Sugar biscuit commonly produces that effect and is attended with another still worse that the hens fed on it lay eggs that are addle or too small and tender When the eggs are small the rape∣seed should be boiled every day to blunt its acri∣mony  "Long experience" says Father Bou∣got "has informed us that this sort of food agrees best whatever the authors who have written on Canaries may assert"  After the hatch the Canaries ought to be purged with plantain and lettuceseeds but care must be taken to remove the young birds which would be greatly weakened by this regimen and the parents must not be confined to it longer than two days When you want to feed them with the stick you ought not as most birdcatchers advise leave them with the mother till the eleventh or twelfth day you ought to remove them with their nest as early as the eighth day The food for the young  Canaries ought to be prepared before hand it is a paste composed of boiled rapeseed yolks of eggs and crumbs of cake mixed together and beaten up with a little water It ought to be given to them every two hours and rammed into their bill It must not be too liquid lest it turn sour and it must be made fresh every day till the young can eat without assistance  The produce of these captive birds is not so regular but appears to be more numerous than it probably would be in the state of liberty Some females have four or five hatches annually and lay four five six or even seven eggs each time and generally they have three hatches and the moulting hinders them from another  "There are females which never lay at all and are called  brehaignes  barren others lay only once or twice in the whole year and even repose two or three days between the first and second egg Others have only three hatches which are regular con∣sisting of three eggs laid without interruption A fourth sort called the  common  because the most numerous may have four hatches of four or five eggs but not always uniform Others are still better layers having five hatches and still more if allowed and in each of these are six or seven eggs When this kind feed well they are excellent and we cannot be too careful of them for they are worth half a dozen of the ordinary Canaries"  Traité des Serins des Canaries  Some however sit even during moulting if they happen to be laying before that season The birds of the same hatch do not all moult at the same time The weakest first drop their feathers and the strongest more than a month afterwards In Jonquil Canaries this change  of plumage is tedious and commonly more dangerous than in the other kinds The female Jonquils have only three hatches each of three eggs the flaxen coloured Canaries are too deli∣cate and their brood seldom thrives The Pink shew a reluctance to pair with each other in a large volery the male but rarely couples with the female of his own colour and to form the union they must be confined together in a cage The white sort are commonly valuable in every respect they lay and breed as well or rather better than the others and the variegated white are the hardiest of all  Whatever differences there may be in the dis∣positions and prolific powers of these birds the period of incubation is the same all of them sit thirteen days and when the exclusion of the young is a day earlier or later it is owing to some particular circumstance Cold retards the process and heat forwards it accordingly the first hatch which is in April requires thirteen days and a half or even fourteen days if the weather is chilly but the third which happens during the heats of July and August is effected in twelve days and a half or even twelve days It would be proper to separate all the good eggs from the bad and to do this with certainty we ought to wait to the eighth or ninth day and take each gently by the two ends for fear of break∣ing it and examine it in a strong light or by a candle and reject all that are addle which if left  would only fatigue the hen By this trial we may often reduce three hatches to two and in that case the third female may be liberated and permitted to begin a second nest  When the eggs of one female are set under another they must be all sound If addle or tainted eggs be given the variegated fe∣males they will throw them out of the nest and if the nest is too deep to admit their being tumbled out they peck them till broken which often spoils the nest and frustrates the whole hatch Fe∣males of other colours cover wind eggs when placed under them  Note communicated by Father  BOUGOT  A plan strongly recommended by birdfanciers is to re∣move the eggs as they are dropt and to substi∣tute in their stead eggs of ivory so that after the laying is over the real eggs are restored and all hatch at the same time Commonly the egg is dropt at six or seven o'clock in the morn∣ing and it is said that if it be a single hour later the bird is sick and as the laying proceeds thus regularly it is easy to remove the eggs as fast as they are excluded  The laying is always at the same hour if the female is healthy however the last egg must be excepted which is commonly seve∣ral hours later and often a day This last egg is always smaller than the rest and I am told that it always gives a cockbird It would be curious to ascertain this singular fact  But this precaution is more suited to the convenience of man than consonant to the train of Nature When five of six young are hatched at once they exhaust the vigour of the mother and rather damp her spirits but if they appear successively they repeatedly renew her pleasure and inspire new courage to dis∣charge her duty Intelligent persons who have  had experience in breeding these birds assure me that they always succeed best when they do not employ this artificial expedient  We may assert that in general all the nice precautions and the refined manoeuvres recom∣mended by writers for training the Canaries are pernicious rather than useful and that in every respect we ought as much as possible to copy Nature In their native country they haunt the sides of small rivulets or wet gullies  The Canary Finches imported into England are bred in the  barancos  or gullies formed by the torrents from the mountains  Hist Gen des Voyages  we ought therefore to give them plenty of water both for drinking and bathing As they belong to an exceedingly mild climate they must be sheltered from the rigours of winter It appears indeed that being long naturalized in France they can bear the cold of that country for they may be kept in a chamber without a fire and even without a glasswindow a wiregrate to prevent their escape being sufficient several dealers in birds have informed me that they lost fewer in this way than when the rooms were heated by a fire The same may be said of their food which is probably the more suited to them the simpler it is  I have often observed from my own experience and from that of others who adhered scrupulously to all the minute directions given by authors that extreme care and attention often killed their birds A regular diet of rapeseed and millet water every day in winter and once or twice aday in summer groundsel when it is to be had in the month of May chickweed in the time of moulting and instead of sugar bruised oats and Turkey wheat and above all great cleanliness areall that I would recommend  Small Tract on the Breeding of Canaries communicated by M Batteau Advocate at Dijoz  N B I must here correct a small error All the birdcatchers whom I have consulted tell me that we ought to avoid giving them chickweed in the time of moulting for it is too cooling and would protract their state of indisposition The other directions of Bat∣reau seem to me well founded  A circumstance that requires  the most attention is not to hasten their first hatch it is common to allow them to couple about the twentieth or twentyfifth of March but it would be better to wait till the twelfth or fifteenth of April for if the season be cold they are apt to contract a disgust to each other and if the females happen to have eggs they aban∣don them at least till the weather grows warm and thus a whole hatch is lost in attempting to accelerate the breeding  The young Canaries differ from the old ones both in the colour of their plumage and in some other circumstances  "A young Canary of the same year observed on the thirteenth of Decem∣ber  Note communicated by  M Gucneau de Montbeillard  had its head its neck its back and the quills of the wings blackish except the four first quills of the left wing and the six first of the right which were whitish the rump the coverts of the wings the tail which was not entirely formed and the under part of the body were also of a whitish colour and there were as yet no feathers on the belly from the  sternum  to the  anus  The lower mandible was impressed into the upper which was thick and somewhat in∣curvated"  As the bird grows up the arrange∣ment and the shades of colour change the old ones can be distinguished from the young by their strength their plumage and their song the tints are deeper and more lively their toes are rougher and incline more on black if they are of the gray kind their nails are also thicker and longer than those of the young ones  Amusemens Innocens p  The female is often so like the male that they cannot at first be distinguished however the colours are always deeper in the male the head rather thicker and longer and the temples of a yellow more inclined to orange and under the bill there is a sort of yellow flame which descends lower than in the female its legs are also stronger and lastly it begins to warble almost as soon as it is able to feed by itself It is true that some females chant at that tender age with almost as much spirit as the males but joining all these marks together we may be able even before the first month to decide which are males or females after that time there is no more uncertainty in that respect for the song of the males then begins to betray their sex  Every sudden utterance of sound is in ani∣mals an obvious sign of passion and as love is of all the inward feelings that which the oftenest  and the most forcibly agitates the frame the ar∣dor is constantly marked by the expression of the voice The birds by their song the bull by his lowing the horse by his neighing the bear by his loud murmur  c  all announce the work∣ing of the same desire The appetite is much calmer in the female than in the male and ac∣cordingly it is but seldom expressed by the voice The chant of the hen Canary is only a feeble tone of tender satisfaction a coy assent to the warm applications of her mate and inspired by the eloquence of his warble but when this pas∣sion is once excited in her veins it becomes ne∣cessary to her existence and if she be parted from her lover she sickens and dies  It seldom happens that the Canaries bred in a chamber are indisposed before laying some males only exhaust their vigour and fall victims to the ardor of passion If the female becomes sick while hatching her eggs must be taken from her and given to another for though she recovers soon she would not sit on them again The first symptom of bad health espe∣cially in the males is sadness as soon as they lose their natural cheerfulness they ought to be put alone in a cage and set in the sun in the chamber where the female is lodged If he be∣comes bloated we must notice if there be a pimple below his tail when this pimple is ripe and white the bird itself often pierces it with the bill but if the suppuration advances too  slowly we may discharge it with a large needle and then fill the wound with spittle without salt which would be too smarting Next day the patient should be let loose in the chamber and it will be easy to perceive by his treatment of the female and the fondness that he shews whether he is cured or not In this last case we must take him again and blow through a small quill some white wine under his wings place him in the sun and notice next day the state of his health If he still continue deject∣ed and indifferent to his female his recovery is now almost desperate we must remove him into a separate cage and give the hen another male like the one she has lost or if such can∣not be had we must seek one of the same species at least A greater fondness commonly subsists between those that resemble each other except in the case of the Pink Canaries which prefer the females of a different colour but this new male must not be a novice in love and conse∣quently must have already raised a hatch If the female falls sick the same treatment may be used  The most common cause of distempers is the too great plenty or richness of food When these birds make their nests in a cage they often eat to excess or select the nutritious aliments intended for their young and most of them sicken from repletion or inflammation If they be kept in a chamber this danger is in a great  measure removed their numbers preventing their gluttony A male which sits too long is sure of being beat by the other males and the same is the case with the females These quarrels give them exercise and necessarily produce tempe∣rance and for this reason chiefly it is that they seldom are ever sick in a chamber during the time of breeding their infirmities and diseases appear only after they have hatched most of them have first the pimple which I have men∣tioned and then they all undergo the moulting Some support well this metamorphosis and still sing a part of the day but most of them lose their voice and a few languish and die After the females are six or seven years old many of them die in changing their plumage the males recover better from the attendant sickness and survive their mates three or four years Indeed we must consider moulting as the regular pro∣cess of Nature rather than as an accidental dis∣temper and if these birds were not reduced by us to captivity and rendered delicate by our treatment they would suffer only a slight indis∣position and would spontaneously discover the proper remedies but at present it is a grievous sickness often fatal and which besides admits of few remedies it is however the less dangerous the earlier it happens  In the time of moulting a bit of steel and not of iron should be put in their water and changed thrice aweek No other re∣medies are needed though Hervieux reckons several only during this critical period a rather larger portion of hempseed should be mixed with their usual food  Note communicated by Father  BOUGOT  Observe that steel is recommended instead of iron only lest the iron should be rusty in which case it would be more pernicious than usesul  The young Canaries  drop their feathers the first year six weeks after they are hatched they become lowspirited appear bloated and conceal the head in their plumage at this time the down only falls but the following year they lose the quills even those of the wings and of the tail The young birds of the later hatches which happen in Sep∣tember or after suffer much more from the moulting than those which are excluded in the spring in that delicate condition the cold is extremely pernicious and they would all perish if not kept where it is temperate or even pretty warm As long as the moulting lasts that is six weeks or two months Nature labours at the production of new feathers and the organic molecules which were before directed to the supply of the seminal liquor are now absorbed in this growth and hence the exuberance of life being diverted into different channels their ardor ceases and the business of propagation is for the time suspended  The most fatal and the most common distem∣per especially in young Canaries is what is called the  swallow avalure  in which the bowels seem to be  swallowed  and drawn to the extremity of their body the intestines are per∣ceived  through the skin of the belly in the state of inflammation redness and distension the feathers on that part drop the bird pines gives over eating though always sitting beside the food and dies in a few days The source of the disease is the excessive abundance or richness of the aliments All remedies are vain and the change of regimen is the only thing which can recover a few out of a great number The bird is put into a separate cage and given water and lettuce seeds thus the heat that consumes it is tempered and evacuations are sometimes per∣formed which save its life This distemper also is the fruit of their artificial education for it sel∣dom attacks those which are trained by their pa∣rents we ought therefore to take the greatest care not to overfeed them with the stick boiled rapeseed and some chickweed are proper but no sugar or biscuit and in general we should give them too little rather than too much  When the Canary utters a frequent feeble cry which seems to come from the bottom of its breast it is said to be asthmatic it is also subject to a certain obstruction of voice espe∣cially after moulting This sort of asthma is cured by giving it the seeds of plantain and hard biscuit soaked in white wine and to restore its voice it ought to have generous food such as yolks of eggs beat up with crumbs of bread and for drink liquoricewater that is water in which that root has been steeped and boiled  The Canaries are also subject to a sort of shanker on the bill This disorder is owing to the same cause with the  swallow  the abundance or richness of food producing an inflammation which instead of affecting the intestines some∣times extends to the throat or palate the same cooling remedies must be applied they should be given lettuceseeds and bruised melonseeds mixed with their drink  The mites and the scab with which these small birds are sometimes affected are generally owing to the dirtiness with which they are kept Care must be taken to preserve them clean to give them water to bathe in to avoid putting old or bad wood in their cages and to cover them only with new cloth that is not motheaten and the seeds and herbs with which they are to be fed should be fanned and washed We must pay this attention if we would wish them to be neat and healthy In the state of na∣ture they would themselves preserve cleanliness but imprisoned they are subject to the loathsome disorders incident to that state however many of these birds though reduced to the melan∣choly condition of captivity are never sick and in these habit seems to have become a second nature In general the source of their diseases is the heat of their constitution They always need water and if a plate with snow be placed in the cage or even in the volery they will roll in it several times with expressions of pleasure  though in the coldest weather This proves that it is rather pernicious than useful to keep them in very hot places  These birds require not to be kept in a warm place as many pretend in the most intense colds they welter in snow when present∣ed them on a plate For my own part I have them in a chamber in winter with only an irongrating and the windows open they sing admirably and I never lose any  Note communicated by Father  BOUGOT    But there is another distemper to which the Canaries and many other birds are subject  The Jays the Goldfinches all the Parrots and the largest Aras  es∣pecially in the state of confinement this is the epilepsy The yellow Canaries in particular are oftener than the others seized with the falling sickness which attacks them suddenly and even surprises them in the midst of their most im∣passioned warble It is said that they must not be touched the moment they fall but must be watched till they discharge a drop of blood from the bill and that they may be then lifted up and will recover themselves and in a short time resume their senses and their life that it is ne∣cessary to wait till Nature makes that salutary effort which is announced by the expression of the drop of blood and that if handled prema∣turely the violence of agitation would bring on instant death It is to be wished that this ob∣servation were ascertained some circumstances in which appear to me rather doubtful Certain it is that if they escape the first attack of this  epilepsy they live a long time after and some∣times attain the same age with those which have never been affected by that distemper How∣ever I am inclined to think that a small inci∣sion in the toes would be beneficial for in that way Parrots are cured of the epilepsy  What miseries in the train of slavery Would these birds if they enjoyed their native free∣dom be asthmatic scabby and epileptical Would they be afflicted by inflammations abscesses and shankers and the most melancholy of disorders what is produced by the craving of unsatisfied lust is it not common to all beings reduced to captivity In particular the females whose seelings are so nice and so tender are more sub∣ject to it than the males It has been observed that after the hen Canary falls sick in the spring before pairing she shrinks languishes and dies The amorous passion is awakened by the singing of the males around her while she has at the same time no opportunity of gratification The males though they first feel libidinous desires and always appear more ardent support better the languor of celibacy they seldom die of continence but they are often killed by ex∣cessive venery  The hen Canaries can like the females of other birds lay eggs without commerce with the male The egg in itself is as we have elsewhere ob∣served only a matrix which the bird excludes and will remain unprolific if not impregnated  with the seed of the male and the heat of in∣cubation instead of quickening it only hastens its putrefaction It has also been remarked that if the females be entirely separated from the males so as not to see and hear them they very seldom lay and that they oftenest drop their eggs when melted by the view or the song of the males so much do even distant objects act upon feeling animals and so many are the ways in which the subtile flame of love is commu∣nicated  We shall here mention two facts to which we were witness A female sung so well that she was taken for a male and paired with another female the oversight being afterwards discovered a male was given to her who taught her the proper functions of her sex she took to laying and renounced her song The other fact is that of a female alive at present that chants or rather whistles a tune though she has laid two eggs in her cage which are found to be addle as all those are which hens lay without the commerce of a cock    I cannot better close this article than by an abstract of a Letter of the honourable Daines Barrington Vice President of the Royal Society to Dr Maty the Secretary  "Most people who keep Canary birds do not know that they sing chiefly either the Titlark or Nightingale notes  I once saw two or three birds which came from the Canary I slands neither of which had any song at all and I have been insormed that a ship brought a great many of them not long since which sung as little  Most of the Canary birds which are imported from Tyrol have been educated by parents the progenitor of which was instructed by a Nightingale our English Canary birds have commonly more of the Titlark notes  The traffic in these birds makes a small article of commerce as four Tyroleze generally bring over to England every year and though they carry them on their backs one thousand miles as well as pay twenty pounds duty for such a number yet upon the whole it answers to sell these birds at five shillings a∣piece  The chief place for breeding Canary birds is Inspruck and its environs from whence they are sent to Conslantinople as well as every part of Europe  Phil Trans vol lxiii part Ja∣nuary    "Nothing however can be more marked than the note of a Nightingale called its  jug  which most Canary birds brought from Tyrol com∣monly have as well as several Nightingale  strokes  or particular passages in the song of that bird  " I mention the superior knowledge in the inhabitants of the capital because I am con∣vinced that if others are consulted in rela∣tion to the singing of birds they will mislead instead of giving any material or useful in∣formation"  FOREIGN BIRDS THAT ARE RELATED TO THE CANARIES  THE foreign birds which may be referred to the Canary are few in number we are acquainted with only three species The first is that which was sent to us from the eastern coast of Africa under the name of  the Mozambique Canary  which seems to be a shade between the Canaries and the Siskins It is delineated  Pl Enl  N  o  Fig and Yellow is the prevailing colour of the lower part of the body and brown that of the upper except the rump and the coverts of the tail which are yellow these coverts as well as those of the wings and their quills are edged with white or whitish The same yellow and brown occur on the head distributed in alternate bars that which stretches over the top of the head is brown next two yellow ones over the eyes then two brown ones which rise behind the eyes after these two yel∣low ones and last of all two brown ones which extend from the corners of the bill This bird is rather smaller than those from the Canary Islands its length from the tip of the bill to the end of the tail is about four inches and a half that of the tail is only about an inch The  female differs very little from the male either in size or in colour This bird is perhaps the same with that of Madagascar mentioned by Flaccourt under the name of  Mangoiche  which he says is a species of Canary  It is likely that this bird which in its plumage resembles much our variegated Canaries was their progenitor and that the entire species be∣longs only to the ancient continent and to the Canary Islands which may be considered as ad∣jacent to the mainland for the one mentioned by Brisson under the name of  the Jamaica Ca∣nary  and of which Sloane and Ray have given a short description  "Bird like the  Serin  variegated with cinereous dilute yellow and dusky colours"  Its extreme length is eight inches its alar ex∣tent is twelve inches the bill short and strong threefourths of an inch long or onethird according to Ray the tail one inch the leg and foot one inch and onefourth Brisson suspects that Sloane is mistaken in his measures for the proportions are not consistent The upper mandible brown bordering on blue the lower lighter coloured the head and the throat gray the upper part of the body of a yellowbrown the wings and the tail of a deep brown radiated with white the breast and belly yellow the under part of the tail white the feet bluish the nails brown hooked and very short  SLOANE's  Jamaica  It is the  Fringilla Cana  of Linnaeus and  Grayheaded Finch  of Latham Its specisic character  "It is dusky yellow above below yellow its head and throat gray its vent white its wings and tail dusky with white lines"  appears to me to be widely different from our Canaries which are not found at all in America Historians and travellers in∣form us that none were originally in Peru and that the first Canary was introduced there in and that the spreading of these birds in  America and especially in the Antilles was long posterior to that date Father du Tertre relates that du Parquet in bought of a merchant who touched at these islands a great number of real Canaries which he set at liberty since which time they were heard warbling about his house so that it is probable that they have multiplied in that country If true Canaries be found in Jamaica they may have been de∣scended from those transported to the Antilles and naturalized there in the year How∣ever the bird described by Sloane Ray and Brisson by the appellation of  Jamaica Canary  appears to differ too much from the natives of the Fortunate islands to be supposed to have origi∣nated from those transplanted into the Antilles  While this article was at the press we re∣ceived several Canaries from the Cape of Good Hope among which I have perceived three males one female and a young one of the same year These males are very like the Green Canary of Provence they differ in being somewhat larger and their bills being proportionally thick∣er their wings are also better variegated the quills of the tail edged with a distinct yellow and they have no yellow on the rump  In the young Canary the colours were still fainter and less marked than in the female  But whatever small differences exist I am still the more confirmed that the variegated  Canaries of the Cape of Mozambique  It appears that the Mozambique Canary is not confined ex∣clusively to that region I have found among the drawings of Commerson a coloured figure of this bird very distinctly marked Commerson calls it the Cape Canary and informs us that it had been carried to the Isle of France where it was naturalized and even greatly multiplied and was known there by the name of  the Bird of the Cape  We may expect to find in the same manner at Mo∣zambique and in some other countries of Africa the variegated Canaries of the Cape perhaps even those from the Fortunate Islands and probably many other varieties of this species  of Provence and of Italy are all derived from the same common source and that they belong to one species which is spread and settled in all the climates of the ancient continent suited to its constitution from Provence and Italy to the Cape of Good Hope and the adjacent islands Only this bird has assumed more of the green tint in Provence more of the gray in Italy more of the brown or variegated colour at the Cape of Good Hope and seems by the variety of its plumage to point at the influence of a dif∣ferent climate  The WORABEE  The second species which appears to us to be the nearest related to the Canaries is a small Abyssinian bird  This is the  Fringilla Abyssinica  of Gmelin and the  Blackcollared Finch  of Latham Specisic character  "It is black yel∣low above its collar black its vent yellow"  of which we have seen  the figure excellently delineated and coloured by Mr Bruce under the appellation of the Wora∣bée of Abyssinia  This small bird presents not only the colours of certain varieties of the Canary the yellow and the black but it has the same bulk nearly and except its being rather rounder the same shape Its bill is also similar and it prefers an oily seed as the Canary does millet and panic But the Warabée has an exclusive pre∣dilection for a plant that bears the oily seed which I have mentioned and which is called  Nuk  The flower of this plant is yellow and of the shape of a cres∣cent the stalk rises only two or three inches From the seed an oil is extracted which is much used by the monks of that country  in the Abyssinian language it never wanders far from that plant and seldom loses sight of it  In the Warabée the sides of the head as far as below the eyes the throat the forepart of the neck the breast and the top of the belly to the legs are black the upperpart of the head and all the body and the lower belly are yellow except a kind of black collar which encircles the neck behind and is set off by the yellow The coverts and the quills of the wings are black edged with a lighter colour the feathers of the tail are also black but with a greenish yellow border the bill likewise is black and the legs of a light brown This bird keeps in  flocks but we know nothing more in regard to its mode of life  The ULTRAMARINE  L' OutreMer  The  Fringilla Ultramarina  of Gmelin and the  Ultramarine Finch  of Latham Specisic character  "It is coerulean its bill white its legs red"  Buff  The third species also of these Foreign Birds which are related to the Canary is known to us from the drawings of Mr Bruce I call this Abyssinian bird  the UltraMarine  because its plumage is of a fine deep blue In the first year this beautiful colour does not exist and the plumage is gray as that of the Skylark and this gray always continues in the female but the males assume the charming blue the second year before the vernal equinox  These birds have a white bill and red legs They are common in Abyssinia and never change their habitation They are nearly of the bulk of the Canaries but their head is round their wings extend beyond the middle of the tail Their warble is very pleasant and this circumstance seems the more to point out their relation to our Canaries  The HABESH of SYRIA  The  Fringilla Syriaca  of Gmelin and the  Tripoline Finch  of Latham    MR Bruce supposes this bird to be a species of Linnet and I ought to pay deference to the opinion of so good an observer but that gentleman having figured it with a thick short bill very like that of the Canaries I have ven∣tured to place it between the Canaries and Linnets  The upperpart of its head is of a fine bright red the cheeks the throat and the upperpart of the neck are a mottled blackish brown the rest of the neck the breast the upperpart of the body and the small coverts of the wings variegated with brown yellow and blackish the great coverts of the wings of a deep ash edged with a lighter colour the quills of the tail and the great quills of the wings also cine∣reous bordered on the outside with a bright orange the belly and the underpart of the tail dirty white with obscure yellowish and blackish spots the bill and legs of a leaden colour The wings reach as far as the middle of the tail which is forked  The Habesh is thicker than our Linnet its body is also fuller and it sings prettily It is a bird of passage but Mr Bruce cannot trace its route and he assures me that in the course of his travels he never saw it except at Tripoli in Syria  THE LINNET  The LINNET  La Linotte  Buff  NATURE herself seems to have assigned these birds a place next after the Canaries for their mutual commerce succeeds better than the intercourse of either with any other contiguous species and what points out the closeness of this relation the progeny is prolific  This observation was communicated by Daubenton the younger Frisch assures us that pairing a Vine Linnet Redpole with a white hen Canary that was in the habit of coming abroad every day and returning to its roost it made its nest and laid its eggs in a neighbouring bush and when the young were hatched it brought them to the window of the house He adds that this crossbreed had the whole plumage of the mother and the red spots of the father especially on the head  especially when a male Linnet is joined with a female Canary  Few birds are so common as the Linnet but still fewer perhaps unite so many amiable quali∣ties a pleasant warble a rich plumage docility of disposition susceptibility of attachment pos∣sessing whatever in short could invite the attention of man and contribute to his delight Endowed with such talents it could not long preserve its freedom and still less when nursed in the bosom of slavery could it retain un∣sullied  the beauties of its original purity In fact the charming red colour with which Na∣ture has painted its head and breast and which in the state of liberty sparkles with durable lustre wears off by degrees and soon disap∣pears entirely in our cages and voleries There remain only a few obscure vestiges after the first moulting  The red of the head changes into a rustybrown varied with blackish and that of the breast passes into nearly the same colour but the new shades are not so deep An  amateur  told me that he has raised some of these Linnets which preserved the red this fact stands single    With regard to the change effected in its song we substitute for the free and varied modulations which spring and love inspire the strained notes of a harsh music which they repeat but imper∣fectly and which has neither the beauties of art nor the charms of nature Some have also succeeded in teaching it to speak different lan∣guages that is to whistle some Italian French and English words c and sometimes even to pronounce these with considerable fluency Many persons have from curiosity gone from London to Kensington merely to hear an apo∣thecary's Linnet which articulated the words  pretty boy  The fact is it had been taken out of the nest when only two or three days old before it had time to acquire the parent song and just beginning to listen with attention it was struck with the sound of  pretty boy  and learned it from  imitation  A goldfinch which was taken from the nest two or three days after hatching and set in a window that looked into a garden where the wrens resorted caught their song and had not a single note of its own species  A sparrow was taken from the nest when it was fledged and educated under a Linnet but hearing by accident a goldfinch its song was a mixture of that of the Linnet and the goldfinch  A robin was set under a very fine nightingale which began to be out of song and in a fortnight was perfectly mute the robin had threeparts in four of the nightingale's warble the rest being a confused jumble  Lastly Mr Barrington adds that the Canaries imported from Tyrol seem to have been educated by parents the progenitor of which was instructed by a nightingale while the Canaries bred in England appear to have derived their song from the titlark  Philosoph Transact Jan    If we breed a young Linnet with a chaffinch or nightingale says Gesner it will acquire their song and particularly that part of the chaffinch's song that is called the  alarum sound  REITERZU p  This fact together with many others appears to me to establish the opinion of the Honourable Daines Barrington that birds have no innate song and that the warble peculiar to the different species and its varieties have nearly the same origin with the languages and the dialects of various nations  The loss of the parentcock at the critical time for instruction occasions undoubtedly the varieties in the song of each species because then the nestling has either attended to the song of some other birds or perhaps invented some notes of its own which are perpetuated from generation to generation till similar accidents pro∣duce other alterations The truth is that scarcely any two birds of the same species have exactly the same notes if they are accu∣rately attended to though there is a general resemblance  BAR∣RINGTON  Philos Trans    Mr Barrington tells us that in experiments of this kind he pre∣ferred a young cock Linnet of three weeks be∣ginning  to fly not only on account of its great facility and talent for imitation but be∣cause in that species it is easier to distinguish the sex some of the outerquills of the wings in the male having the outeredge white as far as the shaft while in the female these are only bor∣dered with that colour  It follows from the experiments of this learn∣ed gentleman that the young Linnets educated by the different kinds of larks and even by an African Linnet called  Vengolina  of which we shall afterwards treat acquired not the song of their parent but that of their instructor Only a few retained the  call  of its species or the Lin∣nets  chuckle  which they had heard of their pa∣rents before they were parted  It is extremely doubtful whether our Com∣mon Linnet called by some the  Gray Linnet  is different from that termed the  Vine Linnet  or the  Red Linnet  for The red spots which distinguish the males in the Red Linnet are far from being constant since as we have already observed they become obliterated in confine∣ment  Of four cock Linnets which were consequently red brought to me on the twelfth of July I exposed one to the open air and set three in a chamber two of which were shut up in the same cage The red on the head of the latter began to disappear by the twentyeighth of August and also that on the lower part of the breast On the eighth of September one of the two was found dead its head was entirely divested of feathers and even slightly wounded I dis∣covered that the one had fought the other after the moulting as if their acquaintance was dissolved by the disguise of plumage The red of the head of the vanquished Linnet no longer existed for all the feathers had dropped and that of the breast was more than half effaced  The third which was shut up was very late in moulting and retained its red till that time The one that was kept in the open air made its escape at the end of three months but it had already lost all its redIt follows from this experiment that either the open air hastens the disappearance of the red by advancing the moulting or that the want of fresh air has a smaller share in the change of plumage in these birds than the loss of liberty  They are not a discriminating cha∣racter  as traces of them are to be found in the bird described to be the male of the Gray Lin∣net where the feathers on the breast are of a dull red in their middle The moulting tar∣nishes and for a time almost discharges this red which recovers not its lustre till the fine wea∣ther but from the end of September colours the middle of the feathers on the breast as in that reckoned by Brisson a common cock Linnet Gesner at Turin Olina at Rome Linnaeus at Stockholm  No mention is made of the Gray Linnet in the  Fauna Suecica  Klein speaks of one Zarn author of a letter on the birds of Ger∣many where he endeavours to prove that there is only one species of Linnet I have heard the same assertion of many birdcatchers who had never seen the letter and Hebert who is certainly a fit judge of the matter is of the same opinion  and Belon in France have known in their respective countries only the Red Lin∣nets Birdcatchers who have in France followed that profession more than thirty years have never found a single cock Linnet which had not the red shade corresponding to the sea∣son and at the same time we see many Gray Linnets in the cage Even those who admit  the existence of Gray Linnets in the state of nature agree that they are scarcely ever caught particularly in summer which they attribute to their shy disposition Add to all these that the Red and Gray Linnets are very similar in the rest of their plumage in their size in the proportions and shape of their parts in their song and in their habits And it will be easy to infer that if Gray Linnets really do exist they are either all females or all young males of the year's hatch before October for at that time they begin to be marked such as being bred apart from the mothers cannot as∣sume red in the state of captivity those which being caught lose their tint in the cage  We must observe that those birds which have had the red spots but lost them still retain on the same parts a rufous colour approaching to red which never appears in the young that have been bred without the mothers and that consequently have never been marked with red  or lastly those in which this beautiful colour is effaced by moulting disease or some other cause  The reader will not then be surprised that I refer these two Linnets to the same identical species and consider the gray sort as only an accidental variety partly effected by education and afterwards mistaken by authors  The Linnet often builds its nest in vineyards and hence it has been called the  VineLinnet  Sometimes it places its nest on the ground at other times it fixes it between two props or  even in the vine itself it breeds also in ju∣niper gooseberry and hazelnut trees in young copses c A great number of these nests have been brought to me in the month of May a few in July and only one in September they were all composed of slender roots small leaves and moss on the outside and lined with feathers hairs and a great deal of wool I never found more than six eggs that of the fourth of Sep∣tember had only three they were of a dirty white spotted with brown red at the large end The Linnets have seldom more than two hatches except their eggs be robbed which obliges them to renew their labours and in this way they may be made to lay four times in the year The mother feeds the young by disgorging into their bill what had been prepared and halfdigested in her craw  After the hatching is over and the family raised the Linnets go in numerous flocks which are formed about the end of August when the hemp is arrived at maturity and at this time sixty have been caught in one drawing of the net  The larknet may be used but it ought to be rather smaller and closer One or two cock Linnets should be had for calls Chaffinches and other small birds are often caught with the Lin∣nets  and out of these were forty males They continue to live thus in society during the whole winter they fly very crowded alight and rise together perch on the same trees and about the  beginning of spring they all chant at once they lodge during the night in oaks and elms whose leaves though dry have not yet fallen they are seen too on the lindentrees and pop∣lars and feed upon the buds they live also upon all kinds of small seeds particularly those of thistles c and hence they haunt indiscrimi∣nately uncultivated lands and ploughed fields Their walk is a sort of hopping but their flight is continued and uniform and not like that of the sparrow composed of a succession of jerks  The song of the Linnet is announced by a sort of prelude In Italy the Linnets of Abruzzo and of the Marche of Ancona are preferred It is generally supposed in France that the warble of the Red Linnet is superior to that of the Gray This is consonant to reason for a bird which has formed its song in the bosom of liberty and from the impulse of its inward feelings must have more affecting and expressive airs than one that has no object but only to cheer its languor or to give the necessary exercise to its vocal or∣gans  The females are naturally destitute of song nor can they ever acquire it The adult males caught in the net profit as little by instruction and the young males taken out of the nest are alone susceptible of education They are fed with oatmealgruel and rapeseed ground with milk or sugaredwater and in the evening they are whistled to in the weak light of a candle  care being taken to articulate distinctly the words which they are wanted to repeat Some∣times to begin them they are held on the fin∣ger before a mirror in which they view their image and believe they see another bird of their own species they soon fancy that they hear the notes of a companion and this illusion produces a sort of emulation which animates their songs and quickens their progress It is supposed that they sing more in a small cage than in a large one  The very name of these birds points out their proper food They are called Linnets  Linariae  because they prefer lintseed to this are added the seeds of panic of rape of hemp of millet of Canarygrass of raddish of cabbage of poppy  Gesner says that if poppyseeds alone be given for food either to Linnets or Goldfinches they will become blind  of plantain of beet and sometimes those of melon bruised From time to time they have sweet cake pricklysorrel chickweed some ears of wheat oats pounded and even a little salt but all these must be properly varied They break the small grains in their bill and reject the shell they ought to have very little hempseed for it fattens them too much and this excessive fat occasions their death or at least renders them unfit for singing In thus feeding and raising them one's self we shall not only teach them what airs we chuse with a Canarywhistle a flageolet c but we shall tame them  Olina advises to shelter them from cold and even to employ remedies for their diseases that we ought for instance to put in their cage little bits of plaster to prevent costiveness to which they are subject he directs oxymel succory c in cases of asthma phthisic  The captive Linnets are also subject to the epilepsy and the boil Some say that they can scarcely ever be cured of this boil others direct to puncture it seasonably and pour wine into the wound  and certain convulsions or beatings with the bill This last however I should suppose is only a kind of ca∣ressing the little animal overcome by in∣ward workings makes the most violent efforts to communicate its sentiments At any rate we must attend much to the choice and quality of the grain that is given it and observe great cleanliness in its food drink and volery when such care is taken the bird may live in confine∣ment five or six years according to Olina and much longer according to others  There is one at Montbeillard that is certainly known to be seventeen years old  They dis∣tinguish those who are kind to them become fond of them alight on them out of preference and behold them with an affectionate air If we would abuse their docility we might even make them draw water for they acquire habits as readily as the Siskin and Goldfinch They begin to moult about the dogdays and sometimes much later a Linnet and a Siskin have been known not to drop their feathers be∣fore  October they had sung till that time and their music was superior to that of any other bird in the same volery and their moult though late in the season was expeditious and easy  The Linnet is a pulverulent bird and it would be proper to strew in the bottom of the cage a layer of fine sand and renew it occasionally there ought also to be a small bathThe total length of the bird is five inches and a few lines its alar extent nearly nine inches its bill five lines its tail two inches somewhat forked and stretching an inch beyond the wings  In the male the top of the head and the breast are red the throat and the underpart of the body rustywhite the upperpart ches∣nut almost all the feathers of the tail and of the wings are black edged with white and hence when the wings are closed there is a white ray parallel to the feathers The female has commonly none of the red that we have mentioned and the plumage is more varied than in the male  The two kinds of Linnets which Buffon conceives to be originally the same are distinguished by systematic writers    The Common Linnet  called sometimes the  Gray Linnet  It is the  Fringilla Linota  of Gmelin the  Linaria  of Ray Willughby Brisson Frisch c The German name is  FlacksFinch  that is  FlaxFinch  the Italian  Fanello  the Dutch  Knue  the Brabantish  Vlasvinch  the Turkish  Gezogen  Aristotle termed it  The character given by Brisson is  "It is of a dusky chesnut and beneath tawny white its wings are marked by a longitudinal white stripe its tailquills are black edged with white"  In the beginning of the spring the breast of the male is of a rosecrim∣son colour which does not take place in the female It builds its nest with moss and bents and lines it with wool and hair lays five eggs    The Greater Redheaded Linnet  or  RedPoll  which Buffon terms  The Greater VineLinnet  It is the  Fringilla Cannabina  of Linnaeus or the  HempFinch  the  Linaria Rubra  of Gesner Ray Brisson c The German name is  Hänfling  or  Hempbird  and the Italian  Fanello Marino  or  SeaLinnet  It is thus characterized by Brisson  "It is of a duskychesnut the margins of its fea∣thers more dilute and beneath of a tawnywhite its wings marked with a white longitudinal stripe its tailquills black the whole of their borders white"  The Linnaean character  "The primary quills of its wings and those of the tail black and white at both the edges"  It is found both in Europe and in America It is smaller than the preceding and is gregarious in winter The female has neither the red spot on the crown nor the blushcoloured breast It nestles on the ground It is a very fa∣miliar bird and quite cheerful a few minutes after it is caught  The opinion of our ingenious author with respect to the identity of the species of the Red Poll and of the Common Linnet is very plausible but it seems not altogether well founded The Red Poll is smaller than the Linnet it nestles on the ground while the latter breeds in furze and thornhedges The egg of the Linnet is of a very faint blue dotted with rusty specks and interspersed with mi∣nute brown streaks The egg of the Red Poll is a very faint green sprinkled with rusty dots and rather sharp at the small end  VARIETIES of the LINNET  I THE WHITE LINNET I have seen this variety at the house of Desmoulin the painter White was the predominant colour of its plu∣mage but the quills of the wings and of the tail were black edged with white as the Com∣mon Linnet and some vestiges of gray also were perceptible on the upper coverts of the wings  II THE BLACKLEGGED LINNET Its bill is greenish and the tail much forked in other respects it is the same in size in proportions and even in colours with the common Linnet This bird is found in Lorraine and we are in∣debted for our information to Dr Lottinger of Sarbourg  The STRASBURG FINCH  Le Gyntel de Strasbourg  Buff  Fringilla Argentoratensis  Gmelin  Linaria Argentoratensis  Briss  Little is known with regard to this bird yet enough to indicate its affinity to the Linnet It  is of the same size it feeds upon the same seeds it flies also in numerous flocks and has eggs of the same colour its tail is forked the upperpart of its body of a deep brown the breast rufous speckled with brown and the belly white It lays indeed three or four eggs only according to Gesner and its legs are red But was Gesner accurately ac∣quainted with the number of eggs and with regard to the red colour of the legs we have seen and we shall have other oppor∣tunities of being convinced that this property is far from being foreign to Linnets especially to those in their natural state The analogy appears even amidst the differences and I am inclined to believe that when the Strasburg Finch is better known it may be referred as a variety derived from climate situation c to the common Linnet  Specific character  "It is dusky above rufous spotted with dusky its lower belly and vent whitish"  It is thus de∣scribed by Brisson  "above it is dusky below rufous variegated with dusky spots its lower belly whitish its tailquills dusky its legs reddish"    The MOUNTAIN LINNET  La Linotte de Montagne  Buff  Fringilla Montium  Gmel  Linaria Montana  Briss  This bird is found in the mountainous part of Derbyshire in England  May not this be the second Linnet mentioned by Gesner and after him by Schwenckfeld which is more shy than the com∣mon Linnet has an inferior song and inhabits arid mountains at least if we judge from the name that he gives it  Stein Haënfling Stone Linnet  it is larger than the ordinary sort and its bill proportionally more slender The red which appears on the head and breast of the common cock Linnet occurs in the male of this species on the rump In other respects the plumage is nearly the same The breast and throat are variegated with black and white the head with black and cinereous and the back with black and rusty The wings have a transverse white ray which is very dis∣tinct being on a black ground it is formed by the great coverts which are tipt with white The tail is two inches and a half long com∣posed of twelve brown quills of which the lateral ones have a white edging which is broader the nearer the quill lies to the out∣side  It is probable that the Mountain Linnet has a forked tail and that its warble is pleasant though  Willughby does not expressly mention these circumstances But he reckons these two characters peculiar to the Linnet with which he ranges it If we be permitted to draw this inference we might consider the Mountain Linnet as only a variety resulting from climate or situation  The Mountain Linnet advances during the winter in flocks to the southern parts of England and perhaps breeds in the north∣ern counties It is larger than the Red Poll being six inches and a half long Specific character  "It is black below pale the throat and breast blackish the rump in the male palered"  Thus described by Brisson  "Above it is black and variegated with tawny below whitish the feathers of the lower part of the neck and of the middle of the breast are black the rump red in the male with a white transverse stripe the quills of the tail dusky the edges of the lateral ones white on both edges"  Its egg resembles that of the common Linnet in colour but the specks are thinner scattered and its shape is rather more bulged  The TWITE  Le Cabaret  Buff  Fringilla Montium  Var Linn  Linaria Minima  Briss  Linaria Pectore Subluteo  Klein  Fanello dell' Aquila  Olin  When we treat of birds whose colours are so variable as in the present we should fall into numberless mistakes if we considered them as specific characters We have already seen that  the common Linnet in the state of liberty was marked with red on the head and breast that the captive Linnet had the same colour only on the breast and that concealed that the Stras∣burg Linnet had it on the legs and that the Mountain Linnet was painted with it on the rump Brisson says that what he calls the Lit∣tle Vine Linnet is red on the head and breast and Gesner adds on the rump Willughby mentions a small Linnet which had a red spot on the head and in that circumstance resembled the two described by Aldrovandus though it differed in other respects Lastly the  Cabaret  of Brisson was marked with red on the head and rump but that of Frisch had none on the head It is obvious that a great part of these varieties is owing to the seasons and the circumstances in which these birds have been seen If in the middle of spring they were clothed in their richest colours if during the moulting season the red had disappeared if immediately after it was not yet resumed If they were kept in a cage the change would be in proportion to the length of their confinement and as the feathers of the different parts of the body would drop at different times there would be abundant source of diversity In this un∣certainty we are obliged in order to determine the species to recur to the more permanent pro∣perties the shape of the body the instincts and habits Applying this method I can per∣ceive  only two kinds of birds that have re∣ceived the name of Little Linnet the one which never sings appears but once in six or seven years arrives in numerous flocks resembles the Siskin c it is the Little Vine Linnet of Bris∣son the other is the Twite of this article  The younger Daubenton had for two or three years one of these birds which was caught in a net It was at first very shy but it became gradually reconciled and grew quite familiar It seemed to prefer hempseed for its food It had a sweet mellow note much like that of the Hedge Petty∣chaps It lost all its red the first year and never recovered it the other colours suffered no altera∣tion When sick or in moult its bill was ob∣served to become immediately pale and yellowish and as the bird recovered it passed through all the shades to its proper brown cast The fe∣male is not entirely destitute of brilliancy of plu∣mage it is marked with red on the head but not on the rump Though smaller than the common hen Linnet its voice is stronger and more varied This bird is rare both in Germany and in France It flies rapidly but never in large flocks its bill is rather more slender in proportion than that of the common Linnet  Measures  the total length of the Twite is four inches and a half its wings are eight inches across its bill rather more than four lines its tail two inches this is forked and projects only eight lines beyond the wings  Colours  The upperpart of the head and the rump are red there is a reddish bar under the eyes the upperpart of the body is variegated with black and rust colour the underpart of the body rusty spotted with blackish below the throat the belly is white the legs brown some∣times black The nails are very long and that of the hind toe is longer than the toe itself  Linnaeus makes the Twite a variety of the Mountain Lin∣net but Mr Latham conceives it to be more related to the Red Poll  "It is variegated above rufous below the abdomen whitish the eyebrows and the bar on the wings tawny the crown and rump red"  It is about four inches and a half long Brisson describes it  "as blackish above and varied with rufous below tawny the belly whitish the stripe above the eyes ru∣fous having spots between the bill and the eyes and under the throat of a dusky blackish colour the crown and rump red in the male the crown red in the female the transverse bar on the wings of a whiterufous the tailquills dusky the whole of the edges tawny"  If we were to judge from the egg of the Twite we should regard it as a variety of the Red Poll The egg of the Twite though rather smaller than that of the Red Poll is of the same shape and colour only the dots are orange smaller and more thickly spread  FOREIGN BIRDS THAT ARE RELATED TO THE LINNET  I The VENGOLINE  This name was applied to it by Mr Daines Barrington It is the  Angola Finch  of Latham the  Fringilla Angolensis  of Gmelin and the  Linaria Angolensis  of Brisson  "It is duskycinereous spotted with dusky below orange the throat and the forehead black the cheeks and throat spotted with white the rump yellowish"  Brisson describes it MALE  "Tawnycinereous above varie∣gated with dusky spots scarlet below the throat lighter colour∣ed the small feathers round the base of the bill and on the throat black the cheeks and throat spotted with white the rump yellowish the tail feathers dusky edged with cinereous white"  FEMALE  "Tawnycinereous above rufous with dusky spots below and variegated both above and below a dusky stripe stretching on either side over the eyes the cheeks light tawny the rump whitish the tail feathers dusky edged with cinereous white"    ALL that is known with regard to the history of this bird is that it is found in the kingdom of Angola that it is very samiliar that it is ranked among the finest warblers of that coun∣try and that its song is not the same with that of our Linnet The neck the upperpart of the head and of the body are variegated with two sorts of brown the rump has a beautiful spot of yellow  which extends to the quills of the tail these quills are brown edged and tipt with light gray as also the quills of the wings and their great and middle coverts The sides of the head are of a light rust colour and there is a brown streak below the eyes the underpart of the body and the sides are spotted with brown on a lighter ground  Edwards who first described this bird and who has given a figure of it at the bottom of Pl is inclined to think it is a female of another that is represented at the top of the same plate Thisother bird is called  Negral  or  Taba∣que  and its song is much like that of the Ven∣goline For my own part I must confess that the song  Daines Barrington says that the Vengoline excels in point of song all the birds of Asia Africa and America except only the American Mocking Bird  of this makes me doubt of its being a female I should rather suppose that they are two males of the same species but from dif∣ferent climates where each would have a distinct name or at least that they are two males of the same climate one of which being bred in a volery had lost the lustre of its plumage and the other not being caught before it was adult or having been kept but a short time in the cage had preserved its colours better In fact the colours of the Negral are richer and more mark∣ed than those of the Vengoline The throat the face and the streak below the eyes are black  the cheeks white the breast and all the underpart of the body of an orange colour without specks and which assume a deeper shade under the belly and the tail These two birds are of the size of our Linnet and Edwards adds that they have the same aspect  II The GRAYFINCH  Specific character  "Hoary the feathers of the wings and of the tail dusky the legs red"    La Linotte GrisdeFer  Buff  Loxia Cana  Linn  Fringilla Cinerea Indica  Briss  Cinereous Grosbeak  Lath  We are indebted to Edwards for the know∣ledge of this bird who had it alive and has given a figure and description of it without in∣forming us from what country it came Its warble is very pleasant It has the gestures the size the shape and the proportions of the Linnet only its bill is rather stronger The underpart of its body is of a very light ashcolour the rump rather darker the back the neck and the upperpart of the head irongray the quills of the tail and of the wings blackish edged with  light cinereous except the longest quills of the wings these being entirely black near the end and white at their origin which gives the wings a white border in its middlepart The lower mandible is encircled at its base with white and this colour extends as far as the eyes  III The YELLOWHEADED LINNET  La Linotte à tête jaune  Buff  Loxia Grisea  Gmel  Passer Mexicanus  Briss  Emberiza Flava Mexicana  Klein  Edwards knew that this bird was called by some  the Mexican Sparrow  Specific character  "Coerulean gray face and lowerpart of the neck white"  Thus described by Brisson  "Above dirty coloured varied with black spots below slightly dusky with dull spots and variegated with dusky spots the forepart of the head the cheeks and the throat yellowish a dusky longi∣tudinal bar behind the eyes the tailquills blackish"  Dr Fermen in his description of Surinam mentions a  Linnet with a yellow throat and bill  the rest of the plumage being cinereous  "It haunts the Savannas and is larger than a Spar∣row"  Its song is not so pleasant as to deserve to be kept in a cage but it is reckoned as a sort of Ortolan because it is delicate eating  and he has ranged it with the Linnets because it is more related  to these than to the Sparrows It is indeed true that it also bears some analogy to the Canaries and we might place it with the Habesh between the Linnets and Canaries but the obscurity of its history renders it more difficult to assign it the proper rank  It is of a pale flesh colour the feet of the same but duskier the forepart of the head and throat yellow and upon this yellow ground there is a brown bar on each side of the head rising from the eye and descending on the sides of the neck all the upperpart of the body is brown but deeper on the quills of the tail than any where else and sprinkled with lighter spots on the neck and back the lowerpart of the body is yellowish with brown longitudinal spots scattered thinly over the belly and breast  This bird was brought from Mexico Brisson says that it is nearly of the size of the Brambling but if we judge by the figure which Edwards gives from the life it must be thicker  La LinotteBrune  of Buffon the  Fringilla Atra  of Gmelin and the  Fringilla Obscura  of Latham  "It is of a blackish dusky colour the breast and rump cinereous the feathers lighter on its crown"  It inhabits Angola and is four inches long    IV The DUSKY FINCH  Our knowledge of this bird is drawn from Edwards Almost all its feathers are blackish edged with a lighter colour which has a reddish cast on the upperpart of the body the general colour that results from this mixture is deep brown though varied It has a cinereous tint on the breast and rump the bill is also cine∣reous and the legs are brown  I presume that Brisson ought not to confound this bird with  the Little Brown Sparrow  of Cates∣by whose plumage is of an uniform brown without any moulting and therefore quite dif∣ferent But the difference of climate is still greater for Edwards's Dusky Linnet came probably from Brazil perhaps even from Africa whereas Catesby's  Little Brown Sparrow  is found in Carolina and Virginia where it breeds and continues the whole year Catesby tells us that it lives upon insects that it is almost always alone that it is not very common that it visits inhabited places and that it is constantly hop∣ping among the bushes We are not ac∣quainted with the habits of the Dusky Linnet  The MINISTER  Le Ministre  Buff  Tanagra Cyanea  Linn  Emberiza Cyanea  Gmel and Lath  Tanagra Carolinensis Coerulea  Briss  Blue Linnet  Edw  The Indigo Bunting  Penn and Lath  THIS is the name given by birdfanciers to a Carolina bird which others call the  Bishop  but which must not be confounded with the Bishop of Brazil which is a Tanagre I place it near the Linnets because in the time of moulting it is so much like these as to be mistaken for them and the female at all seasons resembles them The moult happens in the months of September and October but the period varies as in Bunt∣ings and in many other birds the Minister is said even to drop its feathers thrice ayear in which circumstance it also resembles the Bunt∣ings the Bengals and Senegals c  When clothed in its finest attire it is skyblue upon a violet ground the vane of the wings is of a deep blue with deep brown in the male and with a greenish tint in the female which is sufficient to distinguish it in the moulting sea∣son  Its specific character  "It is azure deeper coloured on the crown the quills of the wings and of the tail dusky and edged with coerulean"  It seems to be extremely like the Painted Bunting  Emberiza Ciris  of Linnaeus  from the male whose plumage is in other respects pretty like that of the female  The Minister is of the size of a Canaryfinch and like it lives upon millet and the seeds of Canarygrass c  Catesby figures this bird by the name of  the Blue Linnet  The Spaniards call it  Azul Lexos  or the farfetched bird as it comes to Mexico from the back parts of Carolina It is smaller than the Goldfinch and has the song of the Linnet It appears in the state of New York about the beginning of summer It builds in the fork of a branch with dry yellow grass and lines the nest with the down of plants  and tells us that it is found among the mountains in Carolina at the distance of one hundred and fifty miles from the sea that its wings are nearly like the Linnet that the feathers of its head are of a deeper blue and those of the underpart of the body of a lighter blue that the quills of the tail are of the same brown with those of the wings with a light tinge of blue and lastly that the bill is blackish and the legs brown and that it weighs only two ounces and a half  Its total length five inches its bill five lines the  tarsus  eight or nine lines the middle toe six lines and a half the tail two inches and extends ten or twelve lines beyond the wings  The BENGALS and the SENEGALS  Les Bengalis  et  les Senegalis  Some of them are termed the Senegal Sparrows  c  ALL travellers and after them the naturalists have agreed that these small birds change their colours in moulting Some even add interest∣ing particulars which we should wish to ascertain that the varieties of plumage are confined entirely to five principal colours black blue green yellow and red and that the Bengals never assume more than one at a time Yet persons who have had an opportunity of observing these birds in France and of watching their alterations for a course of years assert that they have only one annual moult and never change their colour  M Mauduit well known for his enlightened taste in Natural History and for his excellent collection of birds observed a Red Senegal that lived more than a year without changing his plumage Château says the same of all the Bengals which passed through his hands  This apparent contradiction may be explained by the difference of climates That of Asia and Africa the native regions of these birds is more powerful than ours and may have greater influence upon their plumage But the Bengals are not the only birds which undergo the change for according to Merolla the Sparrow in Africa becomes red in the rainy season  and many others are subject to similar alterations At any rate an arrangement founded on the colours of the plumage must in the present case be totally uncertain since in their native climate at least these pretended characters would only be momentary depending on the season when the birds was killed On the other hand their com∣plexion which fluctuates in Africa and Asia is invariable in Europe and it becomes difficult to avoid compounding varieties with species I shall follow therefore the received opinions and allot a separate article to each bird which ap∣pears obviously distinct but without pretending to decide the number of real species which can be only the work of time  We should be much mistaken if we inferred from the names of these birds that they are confined to Bengal and Senegal they are spread through the greatest part of Asia and Africa and even in many of the adjacent islands such as those of Madagascar Bourbon France and Java c We may even expect soon to find them multiplied in America for De Sonini lately set at liberty a great number of them in the Isle of Cayenne and afterwards saw them cheerful and lively strongly disposed to natu∣ralize in a foreign soil and perpetuate their race  A few years ago a Red Senegal was killed at Cayenne in a savanna it had certainly been carried thither by some navigators  We may hope that these new colonists whose plumage is so variable will also suffer the influ∣ence  of an American climate and other varie∣ties will be produced more fit however to decorate our cabinets than to enrich Natural History  The Bengals are familiar and destructive birds in a word they are real Sparrows They visit the houses and even appear in the middle of the villages and alight in numerous bodies in the fields sowed with millet  Travellers insorm us that the negroes eat certain small birds entire with their feathers and these birds resemble Linnets I imagine that Senegals are of the number for some Senegals in the time of moulting are like Linnets Besides it is said that the negroes eat the small birds entire only to retaliate for the damage done among their crops these nestling in the midst of the sowed fields  for they prefer this grain they are also fond of bathing  In Senegal they are caught under a calebash or large gourd which is placed upon the ground and raised a little by a short prop to which a long cord is fastened a few grains of millet serve for the bait The person who watches their motions without being perceived draws at the proper time and secures whatever is under the calebash Bengals Senegals and small black Sparrows with white bellies c  I owe the detail of this sport to M de Sonini  These birds are transported with difficulty and can hardly be reconciled to a different climate but when once naturalized they live six or seven years that is longer than many species proper to the country They have even bred in Holland and the same success would undoubtedly be had  in colder places for these birds are very gentle and social and often caress each other and above all the males and females sit near one another and sing in concert It is added the song of the female is not much inferior to that of the male  The BENGAL  Le Bengali  Buff  Fringilla Benghalus  mas Linn  Fringilla Angolensis  fem Id  The Bluebellied Finch  The specific character  "Light coerulean head and back gray sides of the head purple"  Brisson describes it  "Gray above light coerulean below a purple spot below the eyes the rump and tail feathers light coerulean"  Birdfanciers call it  Mariposa  fem Edw and Lath  AS the instincts and habits are nearly the same in the whole of this family of birds I shall content myself in this and the following articles to subjoin to the general account the delinea∣tion of the peculiar features of each In cases such as the present where the principal object is to convey ideas of the richness and variety of the plumage we ought to quit the pen for the pencil at least we must imitate the painter in describing not only the forms and lineaments  but in representing the sportive fluctuation of tints their changing succession and combination and above all in expressing action motion and life  The Bengal has on each side of its head a sort of purple crescent which lies under the eyes and marks the physiognomy of this little bird  The throat is light blue and the same colour spreads over all the lower parts of the body as far as the end of the tail and even over the upper coverts All the upperpart of the body including the wings is of a pleasant gray  In some individuals this same gray some∣what lighter is the colour of the belly and of the lower coverts of the tail  In other specimens brought from Abys∣sinia this gray had a tinge of red on the belly  Lastly in others there is no purple crescent under the eyes and this variety known by the name of  Blue Cord  Cordon Bleu  Knight of the order of the Holy Ghost  is more common than that first described It is said to be a female but as it is so frequent I should rather suppose that the appearance is owing to the difference of age or climate Mr Bruce who has seen this bird in Abyssinia positively assures us that the two red spots are not found in the female and that all her colours are less brilliant He adds that  the male has an agreeable warble but he never remarked that of the female in both the bill and the legs are reddish  Edwards has figured and coloured a  Blue Cord the Bluebellied Finch  which was brought from the coast of Angola where the Portuguese called it  Azulinha  It differed from the preceding the upperpart of the body be∣ing of a brown cinereous slightly tinged with purple the bill of a deep flesh colour and the legs brown The plumage of the female was of a cinereous brown with a flight tinge of blue on the lowerpart of the body only It would seem to be a variety from the climate in which neither sex has the red spot under the eyes and this accounts for the frequency of the  Blue Cords  It is a very lively bird Ed∣wards remarks that its bill is like that of the Goldfinch He takes no notice of its song not having an opportunity of hearing it  The Bengal is of the size of the  Sizerin  its total length is four inches nine lines its bill four lines its tail two inches unequally taper∣ing and consisting of twelve quills its extent six or seven inches  The BROWN BENGAL  Latham reckons this bird a variety of the Punctured Bengal  Fringilla Amandava  Linn of the following article Brisson terms it  Bengalus Fuscus  or Dusky Bengal and describes it as  "having the throat and breast mixed with dirty whitish the upper co∣verts of the wings dotted with white the quills blackish"    Brown is the predominant colour of this bird but it is more intense under the belly and mot∣tled on the breast with whitish in some indivi∣duals and reddish in others All the males have some of the upper coverts of the wings tipt with a white point which produces a speckling con∣fined however to that sex for the female is of an uniform brown without spots In both the bill is reddish and the legs of a light yellow  The Brown Bengal is nearly the size of a wren its total length is three inches and three∣fourths its bill is four lines its alar extent about six inches and a half and its tail rather more than an inch  FIG THE ANADUVADE  FIG THE SENEGAL FINCH  The PUNCTURED BENGAL  Specific character  "Dusky and tawnyish speckled with white the tailquills black with a white point at their tip"  Brisson's description  "Dusky above mixed with dull red below faintly red the upper coverts of the wings and of the tail the breast and the sides sprinkled with white points the feathers of the wings black"    Le Bengali Piqueté  Buff  Fringilla Amandava  Linn  Fringilla Rubra Minima  Klein  Bengalus Punctulatus  Briss  The Amaduvade Finch  Will Alb Edw and Lath  Of all the Bengals which I have seen this is the most speckled The whole upper part of the body the superior coverts of the tail and wings and the quills of the wings next the back were sprinkled with points the wings were brown and the lateral quills of the tail black edged with white Brown mixed with a dull red was spread over all the upper part of the body including the coverts of the tail and even under the belly a red not so dusky ex∣tended over all the rest of the underpart of the body and the sides of the head the bill was also of a dull red and the legs of a light yellow  The female according to Brisson is never punctured it differs also from the male as its neck breast and belly are of a pale∣yellow and the throat white According to other observers who had many opportunities of  repeatedly seeing these birds alive the female was entirely brown and without spots Is this a variety of plumage or a difference of descrip∣tion for the latter is no small source of confu∣sion in natural history Willughby saw several of these birds which came from the East Indies and as we may expect found several differences among the individuals some had black wings in others the breast was of that colour in others the breast and belly were blackest in others the legs whitish in all the nails were very long and more incurvated than those of the lark There is reason to believe that some of these birds were in moult for I observed one in which the lowerbelly was blackish and all the rest of the plumage indecided as happens when the feathers are dropped the colours pe∣culiar to the species being impressed but not well discriminated  The specimen described by Brisson came from the island of Java Those observed by Charle∣ton were brought from India their warble was very pleasant several of them were kept toge∣ther in the same cage because they disliked the society of other birds  The Speckled Bengal is of a size intermediate to the two preceding its total length is about four inches its bill four or five lines its extent less than six inches its tail an inch and four lines unequally tapered and consisting of twelve quills  The SENEGAL  Specific character  "Dusky ferruginous rufous on the head and under the bill red streaked with black""It is greenish∣dusky above mixed with wine colour and below of a red wine colour the crown red wine the lower belly greenishdusky the quills of the wings black"  BRISSON Some have given it the name of  Ruby  on account of its colour    Le Senegali  Buff  Fringilla Senegala  Linn  Senegalus Ruber  Briss  The Senegal Finch  Lath  THERE are two principal colours in the plu∣mage of this bird vinous red on the head on the throat and on all the underpart of the body as far as the legs and on the rump a greenishbrown on the lower belly and on the back where it receives a slight tinge of red The wings are brown the tail blackish the legs gray the bill reddish except the upper and lower ridge and its edges which are brown and form a sort of redcoloured squares  This bird is somewhat smaller than the Punc∣tured Bengal but longer shaped Its total length is four inches and a few lines its bill four lines its alar extent six inches and a half its tail eighteen lines consisting of twelve quills  VARIETIES of the SENEGAL  I I have seen one of these birds which had been killed in Cayenne in a savanna and the only one that has been seen in that country It probably had been carried thither by some curi∣ous person and had escaped from its cage It differed in some respects from the preceding the coverts of its wings were slightly edged with red the bill was entirely of that colour the legs only reddish and what shews the close analogy between the Bengals and Senegals the breast and sides were sprinkled with some white points  II The DANBIK of Mr Bruce This bird is very common in Abyssinia and partakes of the qualities of the two preceding It is of the same size The red colour which is spread over all the anterior part does not descend to the legs as in the Senegal but it extends over the coverts of the wings where a few white points are per∣ceived likewise on the sides of the breast The bill is purple its upper and lower ridge bluish and the legs cinereous The male sings agree∣ably The female is of an almost uniform brown and has very little purple  The RADIATED SENEGAL  Linnaean specific character  "Gray waved with dusky the bill orbits and breast saffroncoloured""It is streaked transversely with dusky and dirty gray mixed with rosecolour in the lower part of the body and with red on the belly a red stripe near the eyes the quills of the wings streaked transversely with dusky and dirty gray"  BRISSONIt is called Waxbill on account of the colour of its bill Some have confounded it with the  Laki  of China to which many marvellous properties are im∣puted but that bird is as large as a blackbird and bears no rela∣tion to the Senegals    Le Senegal Rayé  Buff  Loxia Astrild  Linn  Fringilla Undulata  Pall  Senegalus Striatus  Briss  Waxbill Grosbeak  Edw and Lath  It is radiated transversely as far as the end of the tail with brown and gray and the  striae  are the more delicate as they are nearer the head The general complexion is much lighter on the lower part of the body it is also shaded with rosecolour and there is a red oblong spot under the belly the lower coverts of the tail are black without any rays but some traces can be per∣ceived on the wingquills which are brown the bill is red and there is a stripe or rather a bar of that colour on the eyes  I have been assured that the female is exactly like the male but the differences which I have myself observed in many individuals and those which have been noticed by others create some  doubts of the perfect similarity of the sexes I have seen several which came from the Cape in some of which the upperpart of the body was more or less of a deep brown and the under more or less reddish in others the upperpart of the head had no rays In that figured by Edwards Pl the rays consisted of two browns and the coverts below the tail were not black which is also the case with what we have represented N  o  fig Lastly in the specimen delineated at the top of Pl the rays of the underpart of the body are spread upon a brown ground and not only the lower coverts of the tail are black as in that described by Brisson but the lower belly is of the same colour  The subject observed by Brisson came from Senegal The two which Edwards examined were brought from the East Indies and most of those which I have seen were brought from the Cape of Good Hope Among so many differences of the plumage remarked between these some must depend upon the distinction of sex  The average length of these birds is about four inches and a half the bill is three or four lines the alar extent six inches and the tail two inches unequally tapered and composed of twelve quills  The SEREVAN  Brown is the predominant colour of the head the back the wings and the quills of the tail the underpart of the body is light gray some∣times a light fulvous but always tinged with reddish the rump is red and also the bill the legs are red sometimes the base of the bill is edged with black and the rump sprinkled with white points and so are the coverts of the wings Such was the Serevan sent from the Isle of France by Sonnerat under the name of  Bengal  That called  Serevan  by Commerson had all the underpart of the body of a light fulvous its legs were yellowish and neither its bill nor its rump was red and not a single speck could be seen on it Probably it was young or was a female  Other birds closely related to this and sent by Commerson under the name of  Cape Bengals  had a more distinct red tinge before the neck and on the breast in general their tail was longer in proportion  They are all nearly of the size of the Bengals and Senegals  The LITTLE SENEGAL SPARROW  The bill and legs are red and there is a streak of the same colour on the eyes the throat and the sides of the neck are of a bluish white all the rest of the underpart of the body is white mixed with rosecolour of greater or less intensity the rump of the same the rest of the underpart of the body blue the upper∣part of the head is of a lighter blue the wings and the scapular

Fernandez mentions as a  wonder  that the stomach of the Maia is behind its neck but if he had noticed the small birds that are fed he would have perceived that this wonder is very common and that as the craw is filled it is pushed to the place where it meets with least resistance often on the side of the neck and sometimes behind it lastly he would have seen that the craw is not the stomachNature is al∣ways admirable but we ought to know how to admire her  The MAIAN  Its specific character  "Dusky head white""It is above of a duskychesnut below blackish head and neck dirty white the breast

country from which this bird is brought that engraved by Edwards came from Malacca and in all probability it might be found in the intermediate countries There is reason however to doubt whether it exists in America and whether so small a bird could traverse the immense oceans which dis∣join the continents at least it differs so much from the Maias the American birds which it the nearest approaches as to require a distinct name In fact its properties are not the same for though it be rather larger it has its wings and tail somewhat shorter and its bill as short be∣sides its plumage is different and much inferior in lustre  In the Maian all the upperpart of the body is a reddish chesnut the breast and all the underpart of the body is of an almost uniform blackish not quite so deep beneath the tail the bill is of a leadcolour a sort of light gray cowl  covers the head and falls below the neck the lower coverts of the wings are of the same light gray and the legs are fleshcoloured  The Maian of Brisson differs from this its breast being of a light brown some of the first feathers of the wings being edged with white the bill and legs being gray c These differ∣ences are too striking to be imputed to the va∣riety of description especially if we consider the scrupulous accuracy of the describers  The CHAFFINCH  Le Pinson  Buff  Fringilla Coelebs  Linn and Gmel  Fringilla  Gesner Aldrov and Briss c  The Snowfleek or Shoulfall  Aristotle calls the Chaffinch  the Italian names are  Franguello Frangueglio  and  Frenguello  in German  Finck Roth Finck Winche  in Polish  Slowick  in Swedish  Finke Bofincke  in Bohemian  Penkewa  Sib Scot III  THIS bird has great power in its bill with which it nips so bitterly as to draw blood Hence according to the several authors the French name of  Pinson  is derived from  pincer  to pinch But as the disposition to snap is not peculiar to the Chaffinch but common to other birds to many different sorts of quadrupeds millepedes c I should rather adopt the opi∣nion of Frisch who supposes this word  Pinson  to come from  Pincio  latinized for the German  Pinck  which seems imitative of the note of the bird  The Chaffinches do not all migrate in the autumn a considerable number remains with us during the winter These resort to our dwel∣lings and even visit our courtyards to obtain an easier subsistence they are little parasites who seek to live at our expence without contri∣buting  THE CHAFFINCH  to our pleasures for in that season they never sing except in fine days which seldom then occur During the rest of the time they lodge concealed in close hedges in oaks that have not shed all their leaves in evergreens and even in holes of rocks where they are sometimes found dead when the weather is excessively se∣vere Those which migrate into other climates assemble often in prodigious flocks but whither do they retire Frisch supposes that their retreat lies in the northern regions his reasons are That on their return they bring with them white Chaffinches which are hardly to be met with except in those climates That they never lead young ones in their train which would be the case if during their absence they lived in a warm country where they might be disposed to breed That they can bear cold except snow which covering the fields deprives them in part of their subsistence  FrischAldrovandus says that in Italy when there is much snow and the frost very intense the Chaffinches cannot fly and are caught by the hand but this weakness may arise from inanition and that again from the abundance of snow Olina alleges that in the same country the Chaffinches retire to the hilly tracts during the summer Hebert has seen many of them in that season among the highest mountains of Bugey where they were as common as in the plains and where they certainly do not remain through the winter    These arguments imply therefore that there is a country in the north where the earth is not robed in the winter and such is said to be the  desarts of Tartary where the snow falls indeed but is immediately swept away by the violence of the winds and extensive tracts laid bare  A very remarkable circumstance in the migra∣tion of the Chaffinches is what Gesner men∣tions of those of Switzerland and Linnaeus of those of Sweden that only the females remove to other climates and the males reside in the country during the winter  "They quit Switzerland in the winter particularly the fe∣males for several males are often seen with not one female"  GESNER  Linnaeus positively asserts that the female Chaffinches leave Sweden in flocks about the month of September that they direct their course to Holland and return in the spring to join their males which have wintered in Sweden  This singular remark is corroborated by Mr White who found that the vast flocks of Chaffinches which appear in his neighbour∣hood about Christmas are almost entirely hens Yet as he seems not to have dissected any he might have been deceived by the change of plumage which is extremely probable  But have not these able naturalists been misled by the per∣sons who informed them and those deceived by some periodical change in the plumage of the females occasioned by cold or other accidents This explanation seems more suited to Nature's general plan and more conformable to analogy than to suppose that at a certain fixed term the females separate from mere caprice and travel into a distant climate when their native soil can afford them subsistence  The migrations vary in different countries Aldrovandus assures us that the Chaffinches sel∣dom breed near Bologna but almost all depart  about the end of winter and return the succeed∣ing autumn On the other hand I find from Willughby that they continue the whole year in England and that few birds are so com∣mon  They are spread through the whole of Europe from the shores of the Baltic and Sweden where they are frequent and nestle to the Straits of Gibraltar and even the coasts of Africa  "Being stationed on the coasts of Africa we were very often visited on board by Chaffinches We cruised between the thirtieth to the thirtyfifth degree of latitudeI have even heard it affirmed that they are found at the Cape of Good Hope"  Note of  Viscount Querhoent    The Chaffinch is a lively bird and perpetually in motion and this circumstance joined to the sprightliness of its song has given rise to the proverbial saying  gay as a Chaffinch  It be∣gins to chant very early in the spring and se∣veral days before the Nightingale and gives over about the summer solstice Its song has merited an analysis and it is distinguished into the prelude the quavering and the close  The prelude is according to Frisch composed of three si∣milar notes or strokes the quaver of seven different notes de∣scending and the close of two notes Lottinger has also made some observations on this subject  "In anger the air of the Chaffinch is simple and shrill in fear plaintive short and often repeated in joy it is lively and ends with a sort of burden"  names have been appropriated to the different parts and the greatest connoisseurs in these  little matters agree that the concluding part is the most agreeable  In German this is called  Reiterzu  in French  Bouteselle  Some find its music too strong or too grating  Mordant  biting  but this must be im∣puted to the excessive delicacy of our organs or rather it is because the sound is too near and increased by the confused echo of our apart∣ments Nature has destined the Chaffinches to be songsters of the woods let us repair then to the grove to taste and enjoy the beauties of their music  If a young Chaffinch taken from the nest be educated under a Canary a Nightingale c it will have the song of its instructors more than one instance  This facility in learning the songs of other birds accounts for the diversity observed in the warble of the Chaffinches In the Netherlands five or six kinds of Chaffinches are distinguished by the various length of their airs  has been known of this but they have never been brought to whistle our tunesthey never depart so wide from nature  The Chaffinches beside their ordinary warble have a certain tremulous expression oflove which they can utter in the spring and also another cry which is unpleasant and said to portend rain  In the German language a word is appropriated to denote this it is  Schircken  It has been remarked too that they never sing better or longer than when from some accident they have lost their sight  They are liable to this accident especially if kept between two windows which face the south  and  no sooner was this observation made than the art was discovered of rendering them blind The lower eyelid is connected to the upper by a sort of artificial cicatrix made by touching slightly and repeatedly the edges with a wire heated redhot in the fire and taking care not to hurt the ball of the eye They must be pre∣pared for this singular operation by confining them for ten or twelve days to the cage and then keeping them shut up with the cage in a chest night and day to accustom them to feed in the dark  Gesner asserts that if the Chaffinches be kept thus shut up through the whole summer and not let out of their prison till the beginning of autumn they sing during the latter season which would otherwise not happen Darkness rendered them dumb but return of light is to them a second spring  These blind Chaffinches are in∣defatigable singers and they are preferred as calls to decoy wild Chaffinches into the snares these are also caught with birdlime and with different kinds of nets and among others those for larks but the meshes must be smaller in pro∣portion to the size of the bird  The time for the sport is when the Chaf∣finches fly in numerous flocks either in autumn before their departure or in spring on their return We must as much as possible choose calm weather for they keep lower and hear better the call They do not easily bend to cap∣tivity they scarcely will eat any thing for the first two or three days they strike their bill  continually against the sticks of the cage and often languish to death  Those caught with limetwigs often die the instant they are taken    These birds construct their nest very round and compact and place it in the closest trees or bushes sometimes they build it even in our gardens upon the fruittrees and conceal it so artfully that we can hardly perceive it though quite nigh It is composed of white moss and small roots on the outside and lined with wool hairs spiderswebs and feathers The female lays five or six eggs which are reddish gray sprinkled with blackish spots more frequent near the large end The male never deserts his mate in the time of hatching he sits at night always at hand and if during the day he remove to a short distance it is only to procure food Jealousy has perhaps some share in this excessive assiduity for these birds are of an amorous com∣plexion when two males meet in an orchard in the spring they fight obstinately till one of them is vanquished and expelled and the com∣bat is still more fierce if they be lodged in the same volery with only a single female  The parents feed their brood with caterpillars and insects they also eat these themselves but their ordinary subsistence is small seeds those of the white thorn of poppy of burdock of the rosetree and especially beechmast rape and  hemp seed They feed also upon wheat and even oats and are expert in shelling the grain to obtain the mealy substance Though rather obstinate they can in time be instructed like Goldfinches to perform several little feats they learn to employ their wings and feet to draw up the cup when they want to eat or drink  The Chaffinch sits oftener squatted than perched it never walks hopping but trips lightly along the ground and is constantly busy in picking up something its flight is unequal but when its nest is attacked it hovers above screaming  This bird is somewhat smaller than our Spar∣row and is too well known to require a minute decription The sides of the head the fore∣part of the neck the breast and the loins are of a wine colour the upperpart of the head and of the body chesnut the rump olive and a white spot on the wing In the female the bill is more slender and the colours less bright than in the male but in both sexes the plumage is very subject to vary I have seen a hen Chassinch alive caught on her eggs the  th  of May which differed from that described by Brisson the upperpart of its head and back was of a brown olive a sort of gray collar sur∣rounded the neck behind the belly and the lower coverts of the tail were white c And of the males some have the upperpart of the head  and neck cinereous and others of a brown chesnut in some the quills of the tail near∣est the two middle ones are edged with white and in others they are entirely black Does age occasion these slight differences  A young Chaffinch was taken from its mother when its tailquills were six lines in length and the underpart of its body was like that of its mother and the upperpart of a brown cine∣reous the rump olive the wings were already marked with white rays but the edges of the superior mandible were not yet scalloped near the point as in the adult males This circum∣stance would lead me to suppose that the scal∣loping which occurs in many species is not the primary organization but is afterwards pro∣duced by the continual pressure of the end of the lower mandible which is rather shorter against the sides of the upper  All the Chaffinches have the tail forked com∣posed of twelve quills the ground colour of their plumage is dull cinereous and the flesh is not good to eat The period of their life is seven or eight years  Total length six and onethird inches the bill six lines the alar extent near ten inches the tail two and twothirds and extends about sixteen lines beyond the wings  Specific character of the Chaffinch  Fringilla Coelebs  LINN  "Its joints are black its wingquills white on both sides the three first without spots two of the tailquills obliquely white"  Thus described by Brisson  "Above it is duskychesnut below white tawny its rump green olive the lowerpart of the neck and the breast wine coloured in the male with a white spot on the wings the lateral quills of the tail are black the outermost distinguished by an oblique white stripe the next terminated obliquely with white on the inside"  VARIETIES of the CHAFFINCH  This Finch is termed  Fringilla Sylvia  in the Fauna Suecica    Before the frequent variations which may be perceived in Chaffinches bred in the same coun∣try others are observed in different climates which are more permanent and which authors have judged worthy of description The three first have been found in Sweden and the re∣maining two in Silesia  The CHAFFINCH  Friugilla Flavirostris Fusca  Syst Nat Ed x  with black wings and tail The wings are indeed entirely black but the outer quills of the tail and the one next to it are edged with white on the outside from the middle This bird lodges among trees says Linnaeus  II The BROWN CHAFFINCH  Fringilla Flammea Fusca  Syst Nat Ed x  It is dis∣tinguished by its brown colour and its yellowish bill but the brown is not uniform it is lighter on the anterior part and has a shade of the cinereous and blackish of the posterior part This variety has black wings like the preceding the legs are of the same colour and the tail forked The Swedes call it  Riska  according to Lin∣naeus  III The CRESTED BROWN CHAFFINCH It is firecoloured and this character distinguishes it from the preceding variety Linnaeus said in that it was found on the northern part of Sweden but twelve years afterwards he re∣cognized it to be the Black Linnet of Klein and asserted that it inhabited every part of Europe  IV The WHITE CHAFFINCH  Fringilla Candida  Schwenckfeld  It is very rare according to Schwenckfeld and differs only in regard to colour from the Common Chaffinch Gesner affirms that a Chaffinch was seen whose plumage was en∣tirely white  V The COLLARED CHAFFINCH  Fringilla Torquata  Schwenckfeld  The crown of its head is white and it has a collar of the same colourthis bird was caught in the woods near Kotzna  The BRAMBLING  Le Pinson D'Ardenne  Buff  FringillaMontifringilla  Linn and Gmel  Montifringilla  Gesner Aldrov Briss c  Fringilla Montana  Roman Orn  The Bramble  or  Brambling  Will  The Mountain Finch  Ray  PERHAPS this bird which in general is supposed to be the Mountain Finch or  Orospiza  of Aristotle is in fact his  Spiza  or principal Finch or our Common Finch or Chaffinch is his Mountain Finch The following are the reasons which incline me to this opinion The ancients never made complete descriptions but seized a prominent feature of an animal whether in its exterior appearance or in its habits and marked it by an epithet The  Orospiza  says Aristotle  It is supposed to be Aristotle's  or Mountain Finch whose female was termed  or Golden Mitred In Ger∣man  Rowert SchnecFinck WinterFinck  in Swiss  WaldFinck ThanuFinck  in Swedish  Norrquint  is like the  Spiza  it is somewhat smaller its neck is blue and lastly it inhabits the mountains but all these are properties of the Chaffinch and some of them belong to it exclusively  I It is much like the Mountain Finch or Brambling as will appear from the comparison and all systematic writers have classed them to∣gether  The Chaffinch is rather smaller than the Brambling according to naturalists and which agrees with my own observations  In the Chaffinch the upperparts of the head and of the neck are of a bluish cinereous whereas in the Brambling these are varied with glossy black and yellowish gray  We have already remarked on the autho∣rity of Olina that in Italy the Chaffinch retires in summer to breed among the mountains and as the climate of Greece is little different from that of Italy we may infer from analogy it will there also have the same habits  Frisch asserts that the Bramblings come from the mountains in autumn and when they return they direct their course to the north The Marquis de Piolenc who has given me several notes on these birds assures me that they leave the mountains of Savoy and Dauphiny in October and do not return till February These periods correspond well with the time when they are seen to pass and repass in BurgundyPerhaps both these species resemble each other in preferring mountains    Lastly the  Spiza  of Aristotle appears to resort according to that philosopher to the warm regions during summer and to prefer the cold climates in winter  Aldrovandus positively asserts that this takes place in the neighbourhood of Bologna Lottinger informs me that some appear in Lorraine from the end of August but that large flocks arrive towards the end of October and even later  But this agrees better with the Brambling than with the Chaffinches since of these a great proportion never migrate while the former not only are birds of passage but  generally arrive in the depth of winter  Hist Anim  lib viii  in the different countries which they visit This is evinced by experience and is confirmed by the appellations of WinterFinch and SnowFinch which they have received in various places  From all these considerations it seems probable that the Brambling is the  Spiza  of Aristotle and the Chaffinch his  Orospiza  The Bramblings do not breed in our climates they arrive in different years in immense flocks The time of their passage is the autumn and winter often they retire in eight or ten days and sometimes they remain till the spring Dur∣ing their stay they consort with the Chaffinches and like these seek concealment in the thick foliage Vast bodies of them appeared in Bur∣gundy in the winter of and other in still more numerous flocks were seen in the country of Wirtemberg about the end of December which every evening reposed in a valley adjoin∣ing to the banks of the Rhine  Lottinger asserts perhaps too generally that in the daytime they spread through the forests of the plain and in the evening retire to the mountains This conduct is not invariable but seems to be affected by situation and circumstances  A flock of more than three hundred were seen this year in our neighbourhood it halted three or four days in the same place which is mountainous They always alighted on the same ches∣nuttree and when sired at rose all at once and constantly directed their course to the north and northeast  Note of the Marquis  PIOLENC  and commenced  their flight with the earliest dawn the ground was covered with their excrements The same occurrence was observed in the year and in  Gazette d' Agriculture  Ann  Never perhaps were so many of these birds seen in Lorraine as in the winter of more than six hundred dozen says Lottinger were killed every night in the pineforests which are four or five leagues from Sarbourg The people were not at the pains to shoot them they knocked them down with switches and though this mas∣sacre lasted the whole winter the body was scarce perceptibly thinned Willughby tells us that many are seen in the neighbourhood of Venice no doubt in the time of passage but no where do they appear so regularly as in the forests of Weissemburg which are plentifully stocked with beeches and consequently afford abundance of mast of which they are so fond that they eat it day and night they live also on all sorts of small seeds I suppose that these birds remain in their native climate as long as they can procure the proper food and quit it only when scarcity obliges them to shift their quarters at least it is certain that the plenty of their fa∣vourite seeds is not sufficient to draw them to a country and even to one with which they are acquainted for in when there was abundance of beech mast in Lorraine the Bramblings did not appear but took a different  route however in the following year several flocks were seen though there was a scarcity of mast  I owe those facts to Mr Lottinger  When they arrive among us they are not shy but allow a person to go very near them They fly close together and alight and rise in the same compact body and for this reason twelve or fifteen of them may be killed at one shot  When they feed in the sields they are ob∣served to perform the same manoeuvres as the pigeons a few always precede and are follow∣ed by the rest of the flock  These birds we see are known and spread through all parts of Europe but they are not confined to our quarter of the globe Edwards observed some that were brought from Hud∣son'sbay under the name of  Snowbirds  and people who traded to that country assured him that they were the first which appeared every year on the return of spring before even the snows were melted  The flesh of the Bramblings though some∣what bitter is good to eat and undoubtedly better than that of the Chaffinch Their plu∣mage is also more varied more beautiful and more glossy but their song is far from being so pleasant and it has been compared to the screech of the owl  Belon  and the mewing of the cat  Olina  They have two cries the one a sort  of chirping and the other which they utter when they sit on the ground resembles that of the Stonechat but is neither so strong nor so clear Though by nature endowed with so few talents these birds are susceptible of in∣struction and when kept near another whose warble is more pleasant their song gradually mellows and comes to resemble that which they hear  Olina  But to have a just idea of their music we must listen to them in the time of hatching it is then when chanting the hymn of love that birds display their true warble  A fowler who had travelled assured me that these birds are bred in Luxemburg that they make their nests in the most branchy firs at a considerable height that they begin about the end of April that they employ the long moss of firs for the outside and hair wool and fea∣thers for the lining that the female lays four or five yellowish spotted eggs and that they begin to flutter from branch to branch about the end of May  The Brambling is according to Belon a cou∣rageous bird and defends itself with its bill to the last gasp All agree that it is of a more easy temper than the Chaffinch and more readily ensnared Many of them are killed in certain fowlingmatches which are frequent in the coun∣try of Weissemburg and which deserve to be re∣lated  The fowlers assemble at the little town of Bergzabern on the evening of the day ap∣pointed they dispatch scouts to remark the trees on which the Bramblings commonly pass the night and which are generally the pitchpines and other evergreens the scouts after their return serve as guides for the company which set out in the evening with torches and shooting∣trunks  Sarbacanes  The birds are dazzled with the glare and killed by pellets of dry earth discharged from the trunks They shoot very near lest they should miss for if a bird chanced to be wounded its cries would scare away the flock  The principal food of these birds when kept in a cage is panic hempseed and beech∣mast Olina says that they live four or five years  Their plumage varies in some males the throat is black in others the head is entirely white and the colours in general lighter  Aldrovandus  Frisch remarks that the young males are not so black at their arrival and that the inferior co∣verts of their wings are not so vivid a yellow as at their departure Perhaps a more advanced age occasions still other differences between the sexes and may account for the diversity of descriptions  The Brambling which I observed weighed an ounce its face was black the upperpart of its  head neck and back varied with yellowish∣gray and glossyblack the throat the forepart of the neck the breast and the rump rustco∣loured the small coverts of the base of the wing yelloworange the others formed two transverse rays of a yellowishwhite separated by a broader black bar all the quills of the wing except the three first had on their outer edge where the great coverts terminate a white spot about five lines long the succession of these spots formed a third white ray which was parallel to the two others when the wing was expanded but when the wing was closed it ap∣peared only like an oblong spot almost parallel to the side of the quills lastly these quills were of an exceedingly fine black edged with white The small inferior coverts of the wings next the body were distinguished by their beautiful yel∣low colour The quills of the tail were black edged with white or whitish the tail forked the flanks streaked with black the legs of a brownolive the nails slightly incurvated the hind one the strongest of all the edges of the upper mandible scalloped near the point the edges of the lower one fitted into the upper and the tongue parted at the tip into several delicate filaments  The intestinal tube was fourteen inches long the gizzard was muscular coated with a carti∣laginous membrane slightly adhering and pre∣ceded by a dilatation of the  oesophagus  and also  by a craw of five or six lines diameter the whole was filled with small seeds without a single pebble I did not see a  coecum  or gall∣bladder  The female has not the orange spot at the base of the bill nor the fine yellow colour of the lower coverts the throat is of a lighter ru∣fous and it has a cinereous cast on the crown of the head and behind the neck  Total length six inches and onefourth bill six lines and a half alar extent ten inches tail two inches and onethird and reaches about

ou  la Niveròlle  Buff  Fringilla Nivalis  Linn Gmel and Briss  This appellation is probably founded on the white colour of the throat breast and all the underpart of this bird and also on the

wings and of the tail also blackish edged exteriorly with blue the head and the upperpart of the neck of the same colour the belly and the inferior coverts of the tail sulphur yellow the bill blackish short strong and con∣vex the inferior mandible lighter coloured the nostrils round placed in the base of the bill and perforated the tongue semicartilagi∣nous and forked the legs reddish brown the midtoe joined to the outer one by a membrane as far as the first articulation the outer toe the largest and its nail the strongest the nails are in general sharp hooked and scooped  These birds appear in pairs and the male and female seem to bear a mutual and faithful at∣tachment they frequent the cultivated fields and gardens and live on herbs and seeds  Commerson who first introduced them to our acquaintance and who observed them at BuenosAyres in the month of September affigns their rank between the Finches and the Grosbeaks He says they are of the size of a Sparrow  Total length seven inches the bill seven lines alar extent eleven inches and a half the tail thirtythree lines and consists of twelve equal quills the wings have seventeen quills and the second and third are the longest of all  The WIDOWS  Les Veuves  Buff  ALL the species of Widows are inhabitants of Africa but they are not entirely con∣fined to that region for they occur in Asia and even in the Philippine Islands They all have a conical bill of sufficient strength to break the seeds on which they feed they all are distin∣guished by a long tail or rather by long feathers which in most of the males accompany the true tail and are inserted above or below its origin lastly all or nearly all of them are subject to two annual moultings the interval between which corresponds to the rainy season and lasts six or eight months during which the males lose not only their long tail but their rich colour and pleasant warble  The melody of their song is one of the reasons that induces Edwards to class them with the Finches rather than with the Sparrows  and it is not before the return of spring that they recover the attributes or ornaments of their sex  The females undergo the same moultings but not only is the change less perceptible in them but the colours of their plumage are not so much affected  The period of the first moulting in the young males must evidently depend on the time of their birth those of the earliest hatch assume their long tail in May but those hatched latest in the season do not assume it till September or October  Travellers assert that the Widows construct their nest with cotton and that they divide it into two stories  Vide  Kolben's description of the Cape of Good Hope It appears very probable that the changeableplumaged Gold∣sinches of which he speaks are really Widowbirds  the upper being destined for the male and the under for the female It is possible to ascertain this circumstance in Europe and even in France where by a careful atten∣tion the Widows may be made to lay and hatch as is successfully practised in Holland  These birds are lively and volatile and are constantly raising and dropping the tail they are very fond of bathing not at all subject to diseases and live twelve or fifteen years They are fed with a mixture of spikenard and millet and by way of cooling they have leaves of succory  It is somewhat odd that the name of Widows by which they are now generally known and which seems to be very applicable to both because of the black that predominates in their plu∣mage and because of their train at the tail owed its origin to a mere mistake The Portu∣guese  called them at first  Birds of Whidha  that is of Juida because they are very common on that coast of Africa and foreigners were de∣ceived by the similarity between that word and the name of Widow in the Portuguese tongue  Edwards was led into this mistake which he afterwards discovered    We shall here treat of eight species of Widows viz the five already known and described by Brisson two new ones which are already dis∣tinguished by a beautiful red spot on the wing and another on the breast lastly to these I shall add the Bird which Brisson calls  the Long∣tailed Linnet  which were it only for the long tail I should rather range with the Widows than with the Linnets  The GOLDCOLLARED WIDOW  Emberiza Paradisaea  Linn Gmel Borov  Vidua  Briss  Passer Indicus Macrouxus

white the abdomen and the coverts of the underpart of the tail blackish the head throat forepart of the neck  back wings and tail black The tail is formed as in other birds it consists of twelve quills nearly equal and covered by four long feathers which rise also from the rump but somewhat higher the two longest are about thirteen inches and are black like those of the tail and appear waved and as it were clouded a little arched like those of the cock their breadth which is nine lines near the rump is reduced to three near the extremity the shortest are inclosed between the two longest and are only half as long but they are twice as broad and end in a slender silky filament more than an inch long  These four feathers have their planes in a ver∣tical situation and are bent downwards they drop every year in the first moulting about the beginning of November and at this period their plumage suffers a total change and becomes like that of the Brambling It is now variegated on the head with white and black the breast the back the superior coverts of the wings dirty orange sprinkled with blackish the fea∣thers of the tail and the wings of a very deep brown the belly and all the rest of the underpart of the body whiteSuch is its winter garb which it retains till the vernal season when it undergoes a second moulting as complete as the former but happier in its effects for it restores the fine colours the long feathers and all the decorations and before the  beginning of July the bird has experienced a total renovation The colour of its eyes of its bill and of its legs never vary the eyes are chesnut the bill leadcolour and the legs flesh∣colour  The young females are nearly of the colour of the males in moult but at the end of three years their plumage has become brown almost black and changes no more  These birds are common in the kingdom of Angola on the western coast of Africa some have also been sent from Mozambique a small island on the eastern coast of

longer than those of the side and the two middle ones are the longest of all In moulting the male becomes like the Linnet only it is of a lighter gray The female is brown and has not the long feathers

the throat the forepart of the neck and the breast of the same white which also extends behind and forms a half∣collar  on the posterior surface of the neck The belly has none of the rufous tinge The bill is red and the legs gray  This species undergoes two moultings annu∣ally like the preceding in the interval the male is divested of its long tail and its white is dirtier The female never has these long fea∣thers of the tail and its plumage is constantly of an almost uniform brown  Length to the end of the tail six inches and one fourth to the end of the nails four inches the bill four

intermediate ones longest the three next white at their origin the two outermost tawny on their exterior edges and white on their interior the bill red"  Commerson suspected that a certain bird of a bluishblack which he saw in the isle of Bourbon where it was called  Brenoud  is nothing but this same Widow in moult and he thence concluded that when the male moulted its plumage it was more uniform But this would apply better to the female than to the male and yet there is a wide difference between bluishblack which is the colour of the Brenoud and uniform brown which is that of the female Domini∣can This Brenoud resembles more the Great Widow  The GREAT WIDOW  Emberiza Vidua  Linn  Vidua Major  Briss  Passer Indicus Macrourus Rostro Miniaceo  Ray and Will  The Longtailed Bunting  Lath

the one white and the other yellowish with which the wings are decorated and lastly by the whitish colour of the lower part of the body and the lateral quills of the tail The four long feathers inserted above the true tail  Aldrovandus expressly observes that the male has a double tail like the peacock and that the longer rests upon the shorter It seems odd that Brisson describes the four feathers of the upper tail as the intermediate ones of the true tail  are black and so are the quills of the wings they are nine inches long and very narrow Aldrovandus adds that the legs are variegated with black and white and the nails black very sharp and hooked  Specific chatacter  "Blackish whitish below four inter∣mediate quills of the tail long and pointed two of them the longest

same name for not to mention other distinctions it wants the osseous tubercle in the palate  The Greenfinch passes the winter in the woods and shelters itself from the inclemency of the season in the evergreen trees and even in elms and branchy oaks which retain their withered leaves  In spring it makes it nest in the same trees and sometimes in bushes this nest is larger and almost as neatly formed as that of the Chaffinch it consists of dry herbs and moss lined with hair wool and feathers sometimes it places it in the chinks of the branches which  it even widens with its bill it also constructs near the spot a little magazine for provisions  We owe these last facts and some others to M  Guys    The female lays five or six eggs spotted at the large end with brown red on a white green∣ish ground She sits assiduously and still con∣tinues on her eggs though a person approaches pretty near so that she is often caught with her young at all other times she is shy and timid The male seems to take much interest in the concerns of his future family he relieves his mate in hatching wheels round the tree where his hopes are lodged makes sudden springs and again sinks back flapping his wings and war∣bling joyous notes  They are kept in a cage because they sing pleasantly BELON Guys adds that the warble of the female is even superior to that of the male which would be singular in birds  At his return to the coun∣try and at his departure he utters a singular cry consisting of two sounds The warble is said to be improved in the cross breed between the Greenfinch and the Canary  The Greenfinches are gentle and easily tam∣ed they learn to articulate a few words and no bird so soon becomes expert at the little manoeuvre of drawing up the cup  De la galere  alluding to the labour of a galleyslave  They eat from the singer of their master and answer his call c In autumn they join other species to roam in the fields they live upon juniper ber∣ries in winter they crop the buds of trees and  particularly those of the bogwillow they feed in summer on all sorts of seeds and especially those of hemp they also eat caterpillars ants and grasshoppers  The name alone denotes that the predomi∣nant colour of the plumage is green but the tinge is not pure there is a graybrown cast on the upperpart of the body and on the flanks with an admixture of yellow on the throat and breast yellow is spread over the top of the belly the inferior coverts of the tail and wings and on the rump it edges the largest quills of the wings and also the lateral quills of the tail all these are blackish and most of them bordered with white on the inside the lower belly is also white and the legs reddishbrown  The female has more brown her belly is entirely white and the inferior coverts of her tail are mingled with white brown and yellow  The bill is fleshcoloured shaped like a cone and similar to that of the Grosbeak but smaller its upper edges are slightly scalloped near the point and receive those of the lower mandible which are somewhat  reentrant  The bird weighs rather more than an ounce and is nearly of the bulk of the Housesparrow  Total length

gallbladder a muscular  gizzard covered with a loose membrane and a pretty large craw  Some pretend that there are Greenfinches of three different sizes but this is not sufficiently ascertained and probably such variations are only accidental resulting from age from food from climate and from other like circum∣stances  Specific character  "Yellowgreen the primary wingquills yellowish before the

back was terminated with yellow  the great quills of the wings and of the tail are of a reddish brown the great coverts of the wings are green the small ones are of a violet blue like the capuchin But Nature requires time to form a plumage so charm∣ing nor is it completed before th  ird year the young Painted Buntings are brown the first year in the second their head is of a vivid blue the rest of the body greenish blue and the quills of the wings and of the tail are brown edged with greenish blue  But it is the female chiefly which resembles the Greenfinch the upperpart of its body is of a dull green and all the underpart of a yellowish green the great quills of the wings are brown edged delicately with green the middle ones and also the quills of the tail di∣vided lengthwise into brown

circumstances Sometimes they assume their winter garb in the end of August or the beginning of September in this state the underpart of their body changes from red to yellowish They feed like the Widowbirds upon millet Canaryseeds succory c but they are more delicate however if they are once seasoned to the climate they will live eight or ten years They are found in Louisiana  The Hollanders

which is distinguished by the colour of the underpart of its body being yellowish it has only a small red spot on the breast which is lost in moulting then all the underpart of the body is whitish and

languages some allude to the yellow spot that decorates its wings  Goldenmitred aurivittis with golden fillets Goldfinch  some to the red which covers its head and throat  RothVogel  Ger i e  Redbird  some to the brilliancy of its colours    from    a star  and others to the  THE GOLDFINCH  effect of their variety    varied  variegated  When the wings are closed each appears marked with a train of white points which are apparent on the dark ground these are the white specks which termi∣nate all the quills of the wing except the two or three first The quills of the tail are of a still deeper black the six intermediate ones tipt with white and the two last have on each side on their inner webs an oval white spot which is conspicuous But these whitepoints vary in their number and arrangement and in general the plumage of the Goldfinch is far from being constant  Sometimes six intermediate quills of the tail are tipt with white sometimes eight of these and sometimes only four or even two and the Goldfinches have received appellations accord∣ingly Nay the difference observed in their song has been at∣tributed to the number of the small spots Those which have six feathers tipt with white are said to warble the sweetest but this assertion is without foundation for the number is often di∣minished by moulting though the song remains invariably the same Kramer says that the quills of the tail and of the wings are tipt with white in autumn and are entirely black in spring this needs to be qualified I have beside me at present th April two cock Goldfinches in which all the wingquills except the two first and the six intermediate ones of the tail are tipt with white and in which are also the oval spots on the innerside of the two lateral quills of the tail    The female has less red than the male and no black at all The young ones do not assume their fine red till the second year they are at first stained with dirty obscure colours and for that reason they are called  Grisets  but the yellow on the wings appears early and also the  white spots on the quills of the tail yet these spots are of a duller white  Observed before the th June I have also remarked that when the Goldfinches were quite young their bill was brown ex∣cept the point and edges which were whitish and transparent which is the reverse of their appearance when adult    The males have a wellknown and a pleasant warble They begin about the st of March and continue during the whole of the genial season they chant even in the winter when kept in warm apartments where they enjoy the temperature of spring  I have two which sang every day through the whole of this winter kept in a close chamber but without any fire The greatest cold has not indeed been under eight degrees fifty de∣grees Fahrenhest  Aldrovandus ranks them the fecond of the singing birds Daines Barrington admits them only into the sixth place They seem to have a greater facility in acquir∣ing the song of the Wren than that of any other bird  Philos Trans    Olina says that the young Goldfinches which hear Linnets Canaries c acquire their song But I know of a young cock Goldfinch and a young hen Linnet that were bred together and the Goldfinch retained his native warble while the Linnet adopted and improved it  This has been experienced both by Salerne and Barrington The latter indeed supposes that this imitation was occasioned by the early impressions made by the notes of that little bird but we must either account in the same way for the case noticed by Salerne or admit that there is a certain analogy between the organs of sound in the Goldfinch and the Wren  In England the Goldfinches from Kent are reckoned the best singers  These birds and the Chaffinches construct the neatest and most compact nests They consist of fine moss lichens liverwort rushes small roots and the down of thistles interwoven with great art and lined with dry grass hair wool and down they generally place them in trees and particularly on plums and walnuts and eommonly select the weak branches which shake the most Sometimes they nestle in copses and sometimes in thorny bushes and it is said that the young Goldfinches bred in such situations are of a darker plumage but more sprightly and sing better than others Olina makes the same remark in regard to those hatched in the month of August The female begins to lay about the middle of spring at first five eggs spotted with reddish brown near the large end  Belon says that the Goldfinches have commonly eight young but I have never found more than five eggs in about thirty nests which I have seen  If the nest be demolished she makes a se∣cond or even a third hatch but the number of eggs diminishes each time I have never found more than four eggs in the nests brought to me in July nor more than two in those of September  These birds are much attached to their young they feed them with caterpillars and insects if both be caught together and shut up in the same cage the parents will still continue their care It is true that of four young Goldfinches which  I treated this way none lived more than a month but I attribute this to the improper choice of food and not to the heroic despair which it is pretended prompts them to kill their offspring and thus deliver them from slavery  Gerini and many others It is even added that if the young ones be reared in a cage by parents which are suffered to enjoy freedom these observing after some time the impossibility to rescuing their brood from bondage will out of compassion poison them with a certain herb Such fables need no refutation    The cock Goldfinch ought to have only one female and that their union may be productive both should be at liberty It is somewhat singular that the cock Goldfinch when shut in a volery is not so much disposed to pair with his own female as with the hen Canary  It is said that the Goldfinches intermix with none of a different species and that the experiment has been made without success in regard to the Linnets But I confidently affirm that with proper care we may obtain not only this but many other combinations for the Siskins are still more easily reconciled to the society of the Canaries than the Goldfinches and yet it is said that in case of rivalship the Goldfinches are preferred by the hen Canaries  or any other female of a warm temperament  Sometimes the hen Goldfinch breeds with the cock Canary but this is unfrequent  Father Bougot let a cock and hen Goldfinch into a volery where there was a great number of Canaries of both sexes The male Canaries copulated with the hen Goldfinch while the cock Goldfinch had no partner which proves the ardour of the Canaries  and on the other hand the hen Canary if separated from the males will consort with the cock Gold∣finch  This circumstance is essential for Father Bougot assures me that if the female Canaries have a fourth or even a sixth of their num∣ber of males they will not associate with the cock Goldfinch and that it is only when neglected by their own species that they join the stranger in which case they always make the first advances    The female is the first to feel the ar∣dour of passion and endeavours by all alluring arts and assisted by the still more powerful in∣fluence of the genial season to urge her languid paramour to consummate this physical adultery and yet there must be no female of his own species in the volery The preliminaries last commonly six weeks during which time the hen Canary makes a complete laying of addle eggs for which her incessant solicitations have not procured fecundation what in animals may be termed lust is almost always subordinate to the great end of nature the reproduction of the species Father Bougot whom I have al∣ready quoted with approbation has observed with attention the little manoeuvres of the va∣riegated female Canary in such situations she often approached the male Goldfinch and squatted like a common hen but with more ex∣pression to invite him to the fruition at first he is deaf to her solicitations but the flame steals upon him by degrees  I have heard it alleged that the Goldfinch was a cold bird he may be so in comparison of the Canaries but after he is roused he appears much animated the male has frequently been observed to drop in an epileptit fit while he chanted rapturously in the height of his passion  often he be∣gins the embrace and his resolution as often  fails at each attempt he spreads his wings and gives vent to feeble cries However after the union is accomplished he proceeds to discharge the duties of a parent he assists his mate in constructing the nest  They prefer moss and dry grass for the materials  and carries food to her while she is engaged in hatching or in rearing her young  Though these constrained amours will some∣times succeed with a hen Canary and a wild Goldfinch it is better to raise together those in∣tended for breeding and not to pair them till they are two years old The offspring resem∣bles more the father in the shape of the bill in the colours of the head and of the wings and in short in all the extremities and the mother in the rest of the body they have also been remarked to be stronger and live longer and to have a clearer natural warble but to be not so docile in adopting the notes of our artificial music  These hybrids are still capable of propagating and when they are paired with the hen Canary the second generation has a manifest analogy to the species of the Goldfinch  Hebert  so much does the male influence predominate in the act of generation  The Goldfinch flies low but with an even continued motion like the Linnet and not by jerks and bounds like the Sparrow It is an  active and laborious bird if not employed in pecking the heads of poppies of hemp or of thistles it is constantly busy in carrying back∣wards and forwards whatever it can find in its cage One solitary male of this species is suf∣ficient to disturb a whole volery of Canaries it teazes the females while they are sitting fights with their males tears away the nests and breaks the eggs We should hardly conceive that birds so lively and petulant could be so gentle and even so docile They live in harmony with each other seek each other's society give marks of regard at all seasons and seldom quarrel but about their food They are not so peaceful with other birds they beat the Canaries and Linnets but in their turn they receive the same treatment from the Titmouse They have a singular instinct of always chusing to sleep in the highest part of the volery and we may naturally suppose a ground of quarrel will be afforded when the other birds will not give place to them  The docility of the Goldfinches is well known they can be instructed without much trouble to perform several movements with accuracy to fire a cracker and to draw up small cups con∣taining their food and drink but for this last purpose they must be  clothed  This clothing consists of a small belt of soft leather two lines broad with four holes through which the feet and wings are passed and the ends joining un∣der  the belly are held by a ring which supports the chain of the cup In solitude it delights to view its image in the mirror fancying it sees another of its own species and this attachment to society seems to equal the cravings of nature for often it is observed to pick up the hemp seed grain by grain and advance to eat at the mirror imagining no doubt that it feeds in company  To succeed in breeding Goldfinches they ought to be separated and raised singly or at least each with the female with which it is in∣tended to be paired  The younger Madame Daubenton educated a whole hatch the young Goldfinches became tame at a certain age and afterwards relapsed into the same savage state in which they would be found if bred by their parents in the field they renounce the refinements of man to enjoy the society of their fellowsBut this is not the only inconvenience of training them together they acquire an affection for each other and when separated to pair with a female Canary they are languid in their amours are affected by the tender remembrance of former friendships and commonly die of melancholy  Of five Goldfinches bred in the volery of this lady and paired with hen Canaries three remained inactive the other two copu∣lated but broke the eggs and died soon afterwards    The Goldfinches begin to assemble in au∣tumn and during that season they are caught among the birds of passage which pillage our gardens Their natural vivacity precipitates them into the snares but to succeed well it is necessary to have a male that has been ac∣customed to sing They are not caught by calls and they elude the bird of prey by taking shel∣ter among the bushes In winter they fly in numerous flocks so that seven or eight may be killed at a shot they approach the highways near which are thistles and wild succory they shake off the snow to obtain the seeds and the caterpillars In Provence they lodge in great numbers among the almondtrees when the cold is intense they seek the cover of thick bushes and always near their proper food Those kept in the cage are commonly fed with hempseed  Though it is true in general that the granivorous birds live upon seeds they also eat caterpillars small grubs and insects and even feed their young with the last they also devour with great avidity small rags of boiled veal but such as are reared prefer in the end hemp and rapeseed to every other aliment  They live to a great age Ges∣ner saw one at Mayence which was twentythree years old they were obliged once aweek to scrape its nails and bill that it might drink eat and sit upon its bar its common food was poppyseeds its feathers were all turned white it could not fly but remained in whatever situa∣tion it was placed In the country where I re∣side it sometimes lives sixteen or eighteen years  They are subject to epilepsy as I have already observed  Owing it is said to a long slender worm which creeps under the flesh in the thigh and sometimes pierces through the skin but which the bird eradicates with its bill I doubt not the existence of these worms which Frisch mentions but I suspect that they are not the cause of the epilepsy  and to melting of the fat and the moulting often proves fatal to them  Their tongue is parted at the tip into small filaments the bill long the edges of the lower mandible fitted into the upper the nostrils co∣vered with small black feathers the outer toe connected to the middle one as far as the first joint the intestinal canal a foot long slight traces of a  coecum  a gall bladder and a mus∣cular gizzard  Total length of the bird five inches and some lines the bill six lines the alar extent eight or nine inches the tail two inches and consists of twelve quills it is a little forked and projects ten or twelve lines beyond the wings  The young Goldfinches are not so long in proportion    Specific character of the Goldfinch  Fringilla Carduelis  "Its wingquills yellow before the outermost spotless the two outmost tailquills white in the middle and the rest at the tip"  Thus described by BRISSON  "It is tawnybrown the fore∣part of its head and its throat red its wingquills white at the tip the first half yellow exteriorly the tailquills black the six intermediate ones white at the tip the two outmost on either side spotted interiorly with white"  The shoulders of the male are black those of the female cinereous in the former the fea∣thers at the base of the bill are black in the latter they are brown The young bird is grayheaded and thence named by the bird∣catchers  a gray pate  The egg is pearly with scattered bloody and blackish spots  VARIETIES of the GOLDFINCH  Though the Goldfinch when kept in the cage does not so soon lose its red tinge as the Linnet yet like all the domesticated birds it is subject to frequent and material alterations in its plu∣mage I have already noticed the varieties of age and sex and also the numerous differences that occur between individuals in regard to the number and distribution of the small white spots of the tail and of the wings and also with re∣spect to the lighter or darker brown cast of the plumage I shall here consider only the princi∣pal varieties which I have examined myself or which have been described by others and which appear to me as derived from accidental causes  I The YELLOWBREASTED GOLDFINCH It is not unfrequent to see Goldfinches which have the sides of their breast yellow and the ring on their bill and their wingquills of a lighter black It has been supposed that they sing bet∣ter than the others it is certain that in the fe∣male the sides of the breast are yellow as in the male  II The GOLDFINCH WITH WHITE EYEBROWS AND FOREHEAD  Fringilla Carduelis  var Linn  Carduelis Leucocephalos  Briss  What is com∣monly red about the bill and the eyes in birds  of this kind was white in the present Aldro∣vandus mentions no other difference I have seen a Goldfinch in which the part of the head usually black was white  III The GOLDFINCH WHOSE HEAD IS STRIPED WITH RED AND YELLOW  Fringilla Carduelis  var Linn  Carduelis Capite Striato  Briss  It was found in America but probably carried thither I have remarked in several Goldfinches that the red of the head and throat was variegated with shades of yellow and also with the blackish colour of the ground of the feathers which in some parts gave a dark cast to the brilliant colours of the surface  IV The BLACKHOODED GOLDFINCH  Fringilla Carduelis  var Linn  Carduelis Melanocephalos  Briss  The Swallow Goldfinch  Alb and Lath  The red peculiar to the Goldfinch is also found in this variety but in small spots sprinkled on the forehead Its wings and tail are also as usual but the back and breast are of a yel∣lowish brown the belly and thighs of a pure white the iris yellowish and the bill and legs fleshcoloured  Albin was informed by a  person of credit  that this individual was bred by a female Goldfinch with a male Lark But a single testimony is not sufficient to support such an assertion Al∣bin  adds by way of confirmation that it bore some resemblance to the Lark in its song and its habits  V The WHITISH GOLDFINCH  Fringilla Carduelis  var Linn  Carduelis Albida  Briss  If we except the upperpart of the head and the neck which were of a fine red as in the Common Goldfinch the tail which was ashbrown the wings which were the same with a bar of dirty yellow the plumage of this bird was whitish  VI The WHITE GOLDFINCH  Fringilla Carduelis  var Linn  Carduelis Candida  Briss  That of Aldrovandus was like the common kind mark∣ed with red on the head and some of the wing∣feathers were edged with yellow all the rest were white  That of Abbé Aubry had a yellow tinge on the superior coverts of the wings some of the middle quills black through their outer half and tipt with white the legs and nails white the bill of the same colour but blackish near the end  I saw one at Baron de Goula's of which the throat and forehead were of a faint red the rest of the head blackish all the underpart of the body white slightly stained with ashgray but purer immediately under the red of the throat and which rose as far as the blackish head its  wings yellow as in the Common Goldfinch the superior coverts olive the rest of the wings white with a cinereous cast on the quills nearest the body the tail nearly of the same white the bill of a rosewhite and very long the legs fleshcoloured This variety is the more re∣markable being the production of nature it was caught full grown in the fields  Gesner was told that Goldfinches are found entirely white in the country of the Grisons  VII The BLACK GOLDFINCH  Fringilla Carduelis  var Linn  Carduelis Nigra  Briss  Several have been seen of that colour That of Asper∣nacz mentioned by Anderson grew quite black after being long kept in a cageAn instance precisely the same happened in the town where I live  In the one described by Brisson four quills of the wings from the fourth to the seventh inclu∣sive were edged with a fine sulphurcolour on the outside and white on the inside the inte∣rior of the middle quills was also white and one of them was tipt with the same colour lastly the bill the legs and the nails were whitishBut it is obvious that description presents only one view of a fleeting existence the object of a general history is to trace the gradation of appearances and to connect the individual with the species  There are at present two Black Goldfinches at Beaune of which I have obtained some infor∣mation They are two males the one four years old and the other of a greater age each has undergone three moultings and has as often recovered its beautiful colours at the fourth moulting both have become of a pure glossy black they have retained this colour about eight months but it appears not more constant than the first for now March the twentyfifth they begin to perceive gray on the belly of one of these birds red on the head rufous on the back yellow on the quills of the wings and white at their tips and on the bill It would be curious to discover how these changes of colours are ef∣fected by the food the air the temperature c It is known that the Goldfinch which Klein elec∣trified lost entirely in the course of six months not only the red on its head but the fine lemon spot on its wings  VII The ORANGEHEADED BLACK GOLD∣FINCH  Fringilla Carduelis  var Linn  Carduelis Nigra Icterocephalos  Briss  Cardueli Congener  Ray and Will  Aldrovandus found this bird to be so different from the Common Goldfinch that he regarded it as of another species belonging to the same genus it was as large as the Chaf∣finch its eyes were proportionally larger the upperpart of its body was blackish the head of  the same colour except that the anterior part near the bill was encircled by a ring of vivid orange the breast and the superior coverts of the wings of a greenish black the outer edge of the wingquills the same with a bar of faint yellow and not of a fine lemon as in the Gold∣finch the rest of the quills black variegated with white those of the tail black the outer∣most one edged interiorly with white the belly cinereous brown  This variety of colour was not owing to the effects of confinement The bird was caught near Ferrara and sent to Aldrovandus  IX The HYBRID GOLDFINCH  Fringilla Carduelis  var Linn  Carduelis Hybrida  Briss  The Canary Goldfinch  Alb and Lath  Many of these have been observed and it would be tedi∣ous and unnecessary to describe them all We may assert in general that as in the mule qua∣drupeds they resemble the father most in the extremities and the mother in the rest of the body But these are not real Hybrids for they are bred between congenerous birds such as Ca∣naries Goldfinches Greenfinches Siskins Yel∣low Buntings and Linnets and they are ca∣pable of propagation nay the breed seems to be improved by crossing for they are larger stronger and have clearer voices c One effect of this intermixture is a multiplication of  the pretended species I shall give an example in the Siskin  The Hybrid of Albin was obtained from a cock Goldfinch separated in its tender age from the mother and a hen Canary It had the head the back and the wings of the Goldfinch but with a slighter tinge the underpart of the body and the quills of the tail yellow the last tipt with white I have seen some whose head and neck were orange it seemed that the red of the male was melted into the yellow of the female  The LULEAN FINCH  Specific character  "Dusky the breast and shoulders ru∣fous the wings black with a rufous spot the undersurface of the neck and body white"    Le Chardonneret a Quatre Raies  Buff  Fringilla Lulensis  Linn  Carduelis Suecica  Briss  The most remarkable property of this bird is that the wings which are rufouscoloured at the base are marked with four transverse rays of different colours and in this order black rust black white The head and all the upperpart of the body as far as the end of the tail are of a dull cinereous the quills of the wings black∣ish the throat white the belly whitish and the bill brown This bird is found in the tract situated on the west of the gulph of Bothnia near Lulhea  FOREIGN BIRDS RELATED TO THE GOLDFINCHES  I The GREEN GOLDFINCH or the MARACAXAO  Specific character  "Green the face and tail red the lower belly waved with white and black"  Described thus by BRISSON  "Above yellowishgreen below white striated trans∣versely with dusky the anterior part of the head and the neck scarlet colour the breast olivegreen the tailquills scarlet above and ashcoloured below"    Fringilla Melba  Linn  Carduelis Viridis  Briss  EDWARDS first figured and described this bird which he tells us came from BrazilIn the male the bill the throat and the interior part of the head are of a red more or less bright ex∣cept a small space between the bill and the eye which is bluish the hindpart of the head and neck and the back yellowishgreen the supe∣rior coverts of the wings and their middlequills greenish edged with red the great quills almost black the tail and its superior coverts of a bright red the inferior coverts ashgray all the underpart of the body striped transversely with brown on a ground which is olivegreen  on the breast and continually grows fainter till it becomes entirely white under the belly This bird is about the size of the Common Goldfinch its bill is of the same shape and its legs gray  The female differs from the male its bill be∣ing of a yellow fleshcolour the upperpart of its head and neck cinereous the base of the wings and the rump yellowishgreen and so is the back without any tint of red the quills of the tail brown edged exteriorly with red wine∣colour the inferior coverts white and the legs fleshcoloured  II The YELLOW GOLDFINCH  Specific character  "Yellow forehead black the wings dusky"  Thus described by BRISSON  "Yellowish Gold∣finch crown black white transverse stripe on the wings quills of the wings and of the tail black the exterior edges and the tips of the lesser wingquills white"  It feeds on thistleseeds The species includes a variety which is afterwards described by the name of the New York Siskin    Le Chardonneret Jaune  Buff  Fringilla Tristis  Linn  Carduelis Americana  Briss Klein  American Goldfinch  Penn Edw Lath  All those who have mentioned this bird give it the appellation of American Goldfinch yet this term would not be proper till it was ascer∣tained that no other Goldfinch existed in the  New World and this supposition is not only improbable but absolutely false for that of the preceding article is a native of Brazil I have therefore adopted another denomination which characterizes its plumage The bill is nearly of the same shape and colour as the Common Goldfinch the forehead black which is pecu∣liar to the male the rest of the head the neck the back and the breast shining yellow the thighs the lower belly the superior and in∣ferior coverts of the tail yellowishwhite the small coverts of the wings yellow on the outside whitish on the inside and tipt with white the great coverts black and terminated with white slightly shaded with brown which form two transverse rays that are very apparent on the black wings the middle quills of these are tipt with white those contiguous to the back and their coverts are edged with yellow the quills of the tail amount to twelve are of equal lengths black above and equal below the lateral ones white on the inside near the tip the bill and legs fleshcoloured  In the female the forehead is not black but of an olivegreen and all the upperpart of the body is of the same colour the yellow of the rump and of the underpart of the body is less brilliant the black on the wings more dilute and on the contrary the transverse rays are not so faint lastly the belly and the inferior co∣verts of the tail are entirely white  The young male is distinguished from the fe∣male by nothing but its black forehead  The female observed by Edwards was shut up alone in a cage and yet layed in the month of August a small egg of pearlgray and without spots but what is more uncommon Edwards adds that it moulted regularly twice ayear in March and September In winter the body was entirely brown but the head wings and tail retained that colour only in summer The male died too soon for this observation but probably like the female it would have dropt its feathers twice annually and in that respect resemble the Bengals the Widowbirds and many other natives of warm climates  In the subject observed by Brisson the belly the loins the inferior coverts of the tail and of the wings were of the same yellow with the rest of the body the superior coverts of the tail white∣gray the bill the legs and the nails white but most of these differences may be owing to the different states in which the bird has been examined Edwards drew it from the life and his specimen appears besides to have been larger than that of Brisson  Catesby tells us that it is very rare in Caro∣lina more frequent in Virginia and very com∣mon in New York The one figured in the  Pl Enl  was brought from Canada where Fa∣ther Charlevoix saw several of that species  Total length four inches and one third the bill five or six lines the tarsus the same the alar extent seven lines and one fourth the tail eighteen lines consisting of twelve equal quills and stretching six lines beyond the wings  The LESSER REDPOLL  In German  Zitzcherlein MeerZeislein Stockhenfling Stick Linnet  and  Rothplattige henfling Red Plated Linnet  in Swiss  Schoperle  in Prussian  Tchetzke  in Swedish  Graosiska  the Greek name is      Le Sizerin  Buff  Fringilla Linaria  Linn Brun Kram Fris c  Fringilla Rubra Minor  Ray Will Briss Klein  The Lesser redheaded Linnet or Redpoll  Penn Barr Ell Alb and Lath  BRISSON calls this bird the Little Vine Linnet but it appears to resemble the Siskin and its song is much inferior to that of the Linnet Gesner tells us that at Nuremberg it has the name of  TschiitScherle  on account of its sharp cry he adds that it appears only once in five or seven years  Whatever is uncommon turns into the marvellous Some say that the appearance of numerous flocks of the Lesser Redpolls forebodes a plague others that they are rats metamorphosed into birds before the winter and resume their proper form in the spring In this way it is accounted for their not being found in summer  SCHWENCKFELD  like the Bohemian Chatterers and arrives in immense flocks We learn from the relations of voyagers that it sometimes pushes its excursions as far as Greenland  "Another bird appears in Greenland in the summer which resembles the Linnet though smaller it is distinguished by its head which is partly red as blood it may be fed with oatmeal in winter Sometimes whole flocks of these birds alight on board like clouds driven by the wind when a vessel is eighty or a hundred leagues from land They have a pleasant song"  Continuation de l'Hist des Voy  May not those be the same birds which the Chinese breed in cages to fight  "These birds resemble Linnets and as they perform distant journeys it will be the less surprizing to find them in a country so re∣mote"  NAVARETTE  Frisch in∣forms  us that in Germany it arrives in October and November and departs in February  I have said that it bears more analogy to the Siskin than to the Linnet this was the opinion of Gesner and it is also that of Dr Lottinger who is well acquainted with these little birds Frisch goes farther for he asserts that the Siskin will serve for a call to allure the Lesser Redpolls into snares in the time of passage and that the two species intermix and propagate with each other Aldrovandus perceived a strong likeness between the Lesser Redpoll and the Goldfinch which except its red head resembles much a Siskin A birdcatcher of great experience and little reading told me that he has caught many of the Lesser Redpolls intermixed with Siskins which they were very like especially the females only their plumage was darker and their bill shorter Lastly Linnaeus says that the Lesser Redpolls fre∣quent places covered with alders and Schwenck∣feld reckons the seeds of these trees among the aliments which they prefer but the Siskins are extremely fond of these seeds The Lesser  Redpolls eat not rape seed like the Linnet but hemp seed the seed of speckled nettles of thistles of flax of poppies and crop the buds of young branches of oak c they mix readily with other birds they are particularly tame in winter and will then allow us to approach very near them without being scared  These remarks are Lottinger's Schwenckfeld relates that a prodigious number of the Lesser Redpolls were caught in the be∣ginning of winter A D  In general they have little timidity and can easily be caught with limetwigs  The Lesser Redpoll frequents the woods and often lodges in the oaks it creeps along the trunk like the Titmouse and also clings to the extremity of the small branches Hence pro∣bably is derived the name of  Linaria Truncalis  i e Trunk Linnet  and perhaps that of Little Oak  The Lesser Redpolls grow very fat and are excellent eating Schwenckfeld says that they have a craw like the poultry distinct from the small sac formed by the dilatation of the  oesopha∣gus  before its insertion into the gizzard this gizzard is muscular as is that of all the granivo∣rous tribe and many pebbles are found in it  In the male the breast and the top of the head are red and there are two white transverse stripes on the wings the rest of the head and all the upperpart of the body mixed with brown and light rufous the throat brown the belly and the inferior coverts of the tail and  wings rusty white their quills brown with a complete border of a more delicate colour the bill yellowish but brown near the tip the legs brown Those observed by Schwenckfeld had cinereous backs  In the female there is no red except on the head and it is besides less bright Lin∣naeus excludes it entirely but perhaps the one which he examined had been kept long in the cage  Klein relates that having electrified in the spring one of these birds and a Goldfinch without occasioning to them any sensible in∣jury they both died the following October the same night but what deserves to be noticed is that both had entirely lost their red tinge  Total length above five inches the alar ex∣tent eight inches and a half the bill five or six lines the tail two inches and a half and somewhat forked contains twelve quills and projects more than an inch beyond the wings  The specific character of the Lesser Redpoll  Fringilla Linaria  LINN  "Variegated with dusky and gray above tawnywhite whitish double stripe on the wings the crown and breast red"  Thus described by Brisson MALE  "Varie∣gated above dusky and tawny gray below tawnywhite dusky spots between the bill and the eyes and under the throat the crown and breast red"  FEMALE  "Crown red double transverse stripe on the wings tawnywhite the tail quills dusky and the edges whitishgray"  It inhabits the whole extent of Europe from Italy to the utmost verge of the Russian empire it is also found in the north of Asia and America It is only half the size of the Greater Redpoll It builds its nest among the alders employing for that purpose small sticks and wool and lining it with hairs and down It lays four eggs of a light seagreen colour marked at the large end with reddish pointsIt breeds in the north of England and re∣sorts in flocks to the southern counties in winter and in that sea∣son it feeds principally on alder seeds  In the female the spot on the head is saffron coloured and not red  The SISKIN  In German  Zinsel

 seu  Ligurinus  Aldrov  Siskin  or  Aberdavine  Penn and Lath  OF all the granivorous birds the Goldfinch is reckoned the most akin to the Siskin both have the bill elongated and slender near the point both are gentle docile and lively The fruits of their intermixture are also fit to propa∣gateSome naturalists have been induced by these analogies to regard them as two contigu∣ous species belonging to the same genus indeed all the granivorous birds may be classed together for their crossbreed are prolific Since this general character extends to them all it becomes the more necessary to select the distinguishing features and to trace the precise boundaries of each species  The Siskin is smaller than the Goldfinch its bill is proportionally shorter and its plumage is  entirely different its head is not red but black its throat brown the forepart of its neck its breast and the lateral quills of its tail yellow the belly yellowish white the underpart of the body olivegreen speckled with black which assumes a yellow cast on the rump and still more yellow on the superior coverts of the tail  But in the more intimate qualities which result directly from organization or instinct the differences are still greater The Siskin has a song peculiar to itself and much inferior to that of the Goldfinch it is very fond of alderseeds which the Goldfinch will never touch and the Siskin in its turn is indifferent about thistle∣seeds it creeps along the branches and suspends itself from their extremity like the TitmouseIn short we might regard it as an intermediate species to the Titmouse and Goldfinch Besides it is a bird of passage and in its migrations it flies at a great height and is heard before it can be seen whereas the Goldfinch continues with us the whole year and never flies very high lastly these two birds are never observed to as∣sociate together  The Siskin can be taught like the Goldfinch to draw up the little bucket it is equally docile and though not so active it is more cheerful for it begins always the earliest in the morning to warble and to rouze the other birds But as it has an unsuspicious temper it is easily de∣coyed into all sorts of snares traps springs c  and it is more easily trained than any other bird caught in the adult state We need only to offer it habitually the proper sort of food in the hand and it will soon become as tame as the most familiar Canary We may even accustom it to perch upon the hand at the sound of a bell for if at first we ring at each meal the subtle association of perceptions which obtains also among the animals will afterwards rouze it to the call Though the Siskin appears to select its food with care it consumes much but its voracious appetite is subordinate to a noble pas∣sion it has always in the volery some favourite of its own species or if that is not to be ob∣tained a bird of another species which it che∣rishes and feeds with the fondness of a parentIt drinks often  The birdcatchers lay limetwigs at the sides of brooks and are very successful in the capture  but seldom bathes it only approaches the margin of the water and dips its bill and breast without much fluttering except perhaps in hot weather  It is said that it breeds on the islands in the Rhine in Franchecomté in Switzerland Greece and Hungary and that it prefers the mountain forests Its nest is very difficult to discover  "The birdcatchers in Orleans says Salerne agree that the discovery of a Siskin's nest is a thing quite unheard of It is probable however that some continue in the country and breed near the banks of the Loiret among the alders of which they are very fond and the more so as young ones are some∣times caught with limed twigs or in traps M Colombeau assures me that he found a nest with five eggs in the bleachfield of M Hery de la Salle"  Kramer tells us that in the forests skirted by the Danube thousands of young Siskins are found which have not dropt their first feathers and yet it is very rare to meet with a nest One day when he was botanizing with one of his friends about the th of June they both saw a male and female Siskin often fly towards an alder with food in their bills but though they searched with all possible care they could neither hear nor see the young ones    which has given rise to a vulgar opinion that the Siskin renders it invisible with a certain stone Accordingly our accounts are imperfect in regard to that subject Frisch says that it conceals its nest in holes Kramer supposes the bird covers it with leaves which is the reason that it is never foundThe best way to ascertain the point would be to observe how they proceed when they breed in a volery which though the trial has not hitherto succeeded is still possible  But it is more common to cross them with the Canaries There seems to be a great sympa∣thy between the two species they shew a reci∣procal fondness at the very first meeting and intermix indiscriminately  Father Bougot from whom I received these remarks has for five years seen a hen Canary breed thrice annually with the same cock Canary and the four following years twice annually with another Canary the first having died  When a Siskin is paired with a hen Canary he eagerly shares her toils he is busy in carying materials for the nest and arranging them and regularly disgorges food for the sitting female But yet most of the eggs are addle for the union of hearts is not alone sufficient in generation and the tem∣perament  of the Siskin wants much of the warmth of the CanaryThe Hybrids resemble both parents  In Germany the Siskins begin to migrate in October or even earlier at this time they eat the hop seeds to the great injury of the proprietors and the places where they halt are strewed with leaves They entirely disappear in December and return in February  Frisch  In Burgundy they arrive at the season of vintage and repass when the trees are in flower they are particularly fond of the blossoms of the appletree  In Provence they leave the woods and de∣scend from the mountains about the end of autumn At that time they appear in flocks of more than two hundred and sit all upon the same tree or at a very little distance from each other The passage continues fifteen or twen∣ty days after which scarcely any more are seen  Note of the Marquis de Piolenc    The Siskin of Provence is rather larger and is of a finer yellow than that of Burgundy  Note of M Guys  It is a slight variety of climate  These birds are not so unfrequent in England as Turner supposed  I mention this on the authority of Willughby But the authors of the British Zoology say that they never saw the bird in the country and we must conclude that it is at least rare in Britain  They are seen as in  other places during their migration and some∣times they pass in very numerous flocks and at other times in very small bodies The immense flights happen only once in the course of three or four years and some have supposed them to be brought by the wind  Olina  "In Prussia myriads are caught in the yards"  KLEIN    The song of the Siskin is not disagreeable though much inferior to that of the Goldfinch which it acquires it is said with tolerable faci∣lity it also copies the Canary the Linnet the Pettychaps c if it has an opportunity of hear∣ing them when young  According to Olina this bird lives ten years  Those which toil at the bucket  à la galere  are much shorter lived  the female of Father Bougot has reached that age but we must observe that in birds the females always outlive the males However the Siskins are little subject to diseases except the melting of the fat when they are fed with hemp seed  The male Siskin has the top of the head black the rest of the upperpart of the body olive and slightly variegated with blackish the small up∣per coverts of the tail entirely yellow the great coverts olive terminated with cinereous some∣times the throat is brown and even black  All the adult males have not a black or brown throat I have had some in which it was yellow like the breast and yet they had all the other characters of the males I had an opportunity to see this black spot form by degrees on one caught in the net it was at first about the size of a small pea and extended insensibly to a length of six lines and a breadth of four in the space of eighteen months and at present th April it appears still to grow This Siskin seems to be larger than common and its breast of a finer yellow    the cheeks the forepart of the neck the breast and the lower coverts of the tail of a fine lemon yellow the belly yellowishwhite the flanks the same but speckled with black there are two olive or yellow transverse stripes on the wings the quills of which are blackish edged exteriorly with an olivegreen the quills of the tail yellow except the two intermediate ones which are blackish edged with olivegreen they have all a black shaft the bill has a brown point the rest white and the legs are gray  In the female the upperpart of the head is not black but somewhat variegated with gray and the throat is neither yellow brown nor black but white  Total length four inches and threefourths the bill five lines the alar extent seven inches and twothirds the tail twentyone lines some∣what hooked and projecting seven or eight lines beyond the wings  Specific character of the Siskin  Fringilla Spinus  "The wingquills are yellow in the middle the first four spotless the quills of the tail yellow at the base and black at the tip"  The egg is very small and white with reddish spots  VARIETIES of the SPECIES of SISKINS  I In the month of September last year a bird was brought to me that had been caught in a trap and which must have been bred between the Siskin and Canary for it had the bill of the latter and nearly the plumage of the former it had undoubtedly escaped from some volery I had no opportunity of hearing its song or of obtaining progeny from it since it died in March following but M Guys informs me that in general the warble of these hybrids is varied and pleasant The upperpart of the body was mixed with gray with brown and with a little olive yellow which last was the principal colour behind the neck and was almost pure on the rump on the forepart of the neck and of the breast as far as the thighs lastly it bordered all the quills of the tail and wings the ground of which was blackish and almost all the superior coverts of the wings  Total length four inches and onefourth the bill three lines and a half the alar extent seven inches and a half the tail twentytwo lines somewhat forked and projecting nine lines be∣yond the wings the hindtoe was the longest  The  oesophagus  two inches three lines dilated in the shape of a small pouch before its insertion into the gizzard which was muscular and lined with a loose cartilaginous membrane the intes∣tinal tube seven inches and onefourth a small gallbladder but no  coecum  II The NEW YORK SISKIN We need only to compare this with the European Siskin to perceive that it is a variety resulting from the difference of climate It is rather larger and has its bill somewhat shorter than ours it has a black cap the yellow of the throat and breast ascends behind the neck and forms a short col∣lar the same colour borders most of the feathers on the highest part of the back and appears again on the lowerpart of the back and on the rump the superior coverts of the tail are white the quills of the tail and of the wings are of a fine black edged and tipt with white all the underpart of the body is dirty white As the Siskins are roving birds and fly very lofty they may have migrated into North America and suffered some changes in their plumage  Mr Latham reckons this bird a variety of the  Yellow Goldsinch  or  American Goldsinch  Fringilla Tristis before de∣scribed    III The OLIVAREZ  Fringilla Spinus  Var Linn  The upperpart of the body is olive the under lemon the head  black the quills of the tail and wings blackish edged more or less with light yellow the wings marked with a yellow stripe So far it much re∣sembles the European and the New York Siskin and its size and shape are the same It is pro∣bably the same bird which being lately intro∣duced into these different climates has not yet undergone all the change  In the female the top of the head is of a browngray and the cheeks lemon as also the throat  It has a pleasant song and in that respect excels all the birds of South America It is found near BuenosAyres and the Straits of Magellan in the woods which shelter it from the severity of the cold and the violence of the winds The one which Commerson law was caught by the foot between the two valves of a muscle  The bill and legs were cinereous the pupil bluish the midtoe joined by its phalanx to the outertoe the hindtoe the thickest and its nail the longest of all it weighed an ounce  Total length four inches and a half the bill five lines the alar extent eight inches the tail twentytwo lines somewhat forked composed of twelve quills and projecting about an inch beyond the wings the wings consist of only sixteen feathers  IV The BLACK SISKIN  Fringilla Spinus  Var Linn  Ligurinus  Briss  As there are Black Goldfinches with an orange head so there are Black Siskins with a yellow head Schwenck∣feld saw one of that colour in the volery of a Sile∣sian gentleman all the plumage was black ex∣cept the top of the head which was yellowish  FOREIGN BIRDS RELATED TO THE SISKIN  I The CATOTOL  Specific character  "Variegated with blackish and fulvous below bright white"    Fringilla Catotol  Gmel  Cacatototl  Ray  Ligurinus Mexicanus Niger  Briss  The Black Maxican Siskin  Lath  THIS is the name given in Mexico to a small bird of the size of our Siskin which has all the upperpart variegated with blackish ful∣vous and all the lowerpart whitish and the legs cinereous it resides in plains lives on the seeds of a tree called by the Mexicans  hoauhtli  and sings agreeably  II The ACATECHILI  Specific character  "Greenish dusky below whitish"    Fringilla Mexicana  Gmel  Ligurinus Mexicanus  Briss  Acatechichictli  Ray  The Mexican Siskin  Lath  The little which we know of this bird evincea its relation to the Siskin its size is nearly the same its song the same and it feeds on the same substances its head and all the upperpart of the body are greenish brown the throat and all the underpart white shaded with yellow The Mexican name  Acatechichictli  signifies the  bird that rubs itself against the reeds  may not this allude to some of its habits  The TANAGRES  Les Tangaras  Buff  IN the warm parts of America is found a very numerous genus of birds some of which are called  Tangaras  at Brazil and nomencla∣tors have adopted this name for all the species included These birds have been supposed by most travellers to be a kind of Sparrows in fact they differ from the European Sparrows only by their colours and by a minute character that the upper mandible is scolloped on both sides near the point They closely resemble the Sparrows in their instinctive habits they fly low and by jerks their notes are for the most part harsh they may be also reckoned granivorous for they live upon very small fruits they are social with each other and like the Sparrows are so familiar as to visit the dwellings they settle in dry grounds and never in marshes they lay two eggs and sometimes though rarely three  The Sparrows of Cayenne have seldom more eggs while those of Europe have five or six and this difference is perceived in general be∣tween birds of hot and those of temperate cli∣mates The smalness of the hatch is compen∣sated  by its frequent repetition love being che∣rished and maintained by the continual and uni∣form warmth  The whole genus of Tanagres of which we know more than thirty species exclusive of va∣rieties seems confined to the new continent for all those which we have received were brought from Guiana and other countries of America and not from Africa or India This multitude of species is not surprising for in general the number of birds in the torrid zone is perhaps ten times greater than in other regions because nature is there more prolific and less disturbed in her operations by the interference of man because forests are there more frequent sub∣sistence is more plentiful and the colds of win∣ter are unknown and the natives of the tro∣pical countries rioting in a perpetual abundance are totally exempted from the risks and dangers of a migration and seldom are obliged even to shift from one haunt to another  To avoid confusion we shall range the thirty species of Tanagres into three divisions adopting the characters from the most obvious difference that of size  THE GRAND TANAGRE  The GRAND TANAGRE  Tanagra Magna  Gmel  First Species  This is represented N  o  Pl Enl by the appellation of  the Tanagre of the Woods of Ca∣yenne  because I was told that it always came out of the extensive forests but M Sonini of Manoncour has since informed me that it also lodges often in the bushes in open situations The male and female which are much alike commonly fly together They live on small fruits and sometimes eat the insects that prey on plants  The figure will give a distinct idea of this bird It is entirely a new species  Specific character  "Dusky olive the forehead and cheeks coerulean a black maxillary furrow the neck and the lower part of the rump red the eyebrows and a spot on the throat white"  It is of the size of a thrush the underpart of the body reddish  The CRESTED TANAGRE  La Houppette  Buff  Tanagra Cristata  Linn and Gmel  Tanagra Cayanensis Nigra Cristata  Briss  Second Species  This bird is not quite so large as the preced∣ing and is proportionally thicker Its owes its  name to a small crest which it can erect at pleasure and which distinguishes it from all the other Tanagres  It is very common in Guiana where it lives on small fruits It has a shrill cry like that of the Chaffinch but has not the song of that bird It is found only in the cleared spots  Specific character  "Blackish a goldcoloured crest the throat and rump fulvous"  Thus described by BRISSON  "Crested and blackish the crest goldcoloured the feathers at the base of the bill black the throat the lowest part of the back and the rump dilute fulvous white spots on the wings the tailquills blackish"  It is six inches and one fourth long its legs are leadcoloured  The VIOLET TANAGRE  Le Tangavio  Contracted for  Tangaraviolet  Buff  Tanagra Bonariensis  Gmel  Third Species  We are indebted to the late M Commerson for our knowledge of this bird it is well pre∣served in his collection he had called it the  Black Bunting Bruant Noir  which is very improperIt is of a deep violet on the body and even on the belly with some greenish re∣flections on the wings and tail  It measures from the end of the bill to that of the tail eight inches its bill is blackish and  eight or nine lines in length its tail which is not taper is three inches long and projects eighteen lines beyond the wings the  tarsus  is about an inch long and blackish as well as the toes the nails are thick and strong  In the female the head is of a shining black like polished steel all the rest of the plumage is of an uniform blue On the upperpart of the body however and on the rump are some tints of a shining black  The Violet Tanagre is found at BuenosAyres and probably in other parts of Paraguay We are unacquainted with its mode of life  Specific character  "Blackviolet the wings and tail glossed with green"  The SCARLET TANAGRE  Le Scarlatte  Buff  Tanagra Rubra  var Linn  Fourth Species  This bird is the same with the Cardinal of Brisson and with the Scarlet Sparrow of Ed∣wards To it we should also refer first the two Red and Black Sparrows of Aldrovandus the only difference being that the one happened to lose its tail and this defect has been convert∣ed by Aldrovandus into a specific character in which error he has been copied by all the orni∣thologists  Tanagra Brasilia  var Gmel  The Rumpless Blue and Red Indian Sparrow  Will    Secondly The  Tijepiranga  of Marc∣grave  Mr Latham reckons the  Tijepiranga  to be the female of the  Hooded Tanagre Tanagra Pileata  Thirdly The  Chiltototl  This is the  Tanagra Brasilia  of Linnaeus the  Cardinalis  of Brisson and the  Brasilian Tanager  of Latham Its specific cha∣racter  "It is scarlet its wings and tail black"  It is six inches and one fourth long  of Fernan∣dez Fourthly and lastly The Brazilian Blackbird of Belon which received that name from those who first imported it into France Aldro∣vandus has copied Belon The descriptions coin∣cide in every respect except in the songs of these birds and I observed that those which chanted were larger had a brighter red tinge on the plumage and also on the superior coverts of the wings c which makes it very probable that they were the males indeed in almost all kinds of birds it is the males that are musical  It would also appear that in the male the feathers on the head are longer and form a sort of crest as Edwards has figured it This has led some travellers to say that there are two kinds of Cardinals in Mexico one crested which sings agreeably and the other smaller which sings not at all  These birds belong to the warm climates of Mexico Peru and Brazil but are rare in Gui∣ana Belon tells us that in his time the mer∣chants who traded to Brazil drew considerable  profit from the importation of them Probably the feathers were employed to ornament the robes and other dresses then in fashion and these birds were more numerous than at present  We may presume that when travellers talk of the warble of the Cardinal they mean the Scar∣let Tanagre for the  Crested Cardinal  is of the genus of the Grosbeaks and consequently a silent bird With regard to this point Salerne contradicts himself in the same page It is uni∣versally admitted that this Tanagre has an agree∣able warble and is susceptible even of instruc∣tion Fernandez relates that it is found parti∣cularly at Totonocapa in Mexico and sings delightfully  We reckon the following varieties of this species  First  The Spotted Cardinal  Cardinalis Naevius  Briss  mentioned by Brisson which differs from the Scarlet Tanagre only because some feathers of its back and breast are edged with green which forms spots of the same colour and of a crescent shape Aldro∣vandus calls this  The Shorttailed Blackbird  Secondly  The Collared Cardinal  Cardinalis Torquatus  Briss  mentioned by Brisson It has not only the same size and colours as the Scarlet Tanagre but the small coverts and the edges of the quills of the wings are blue and on each side of the neck are two great spots of the same colour they are conti∣guous  and shaped like a crescent But Brisson copies his descriptions of the Collared and Spot∣ted Cardinal from Aldrovandus who saw only the figures of these two birds which renders their very existence doubtful Indeed I should not have taken notice of them did not the no∣menclators insert them in their catalogues  Thirdly The Mexican bird which Hernan∣dez calls  The Parrotcoloured Mexican bird  and which Brisson describes under the name of  Mexican Cardinal  Hernandez says only  "This bird from the lower part of the bill which is somewhat hooked and entirely cinereous as far as the tail including the whole of the belly is of a minium tinge The same colour is spread over the rump and part of the back but near the wings it receives a greenish tinge that gradually increases from thence to the neck which is quite green The head has an amethystine or hya∣cinthine tinge The circle which surrounds the pupil is very white and the orbits of a deep coerulean The origin of the wings is yellowish their quills hyacinthine and marked with a greenish streak The tail is entirely amethys∣tine without any mixture of green and more dilute near the end The legs which have three toes before and one behind are of a cinereous∣violet"  These birds fly in flocks and are easily caught with nooses and other snares They are readily tamed are fat and good to eat  The CANADA TANAGRE  Tanagra Rubra  Gmel  Cardinalis Canadensis  Briss  The Red Tanagre  Penn and Lath  The Summer Redbird  Catesby  Fifth Species  This bird differs from the Scarlet Tanagre by its size and plumage it is smaller and of a light flamecolour its bill is entirely of a leadcolour and has none of the peculiar characters while in the Scarlet Tanagre the upperpart of the bill is of a deep black and the point of the lower mandible black the rest of it white and bellied transversely  The Scarlet Tanagre is only found in the warmer parts of South America as in Mexico Peru and Brazil The Canada Tanagre occurs in many tracts in North America in the coun∣try of the Illinois  "It is scarce more than an hundred leagues south of Canada that the Cardinals begin to be seen Their song is sweet their plumage beautiful and their head wears a crest"  CHARLEVOIX  in Louisiana  Le Page Dupratz  and in Flo∣rida  "On Wednesday arrived at the port of Havannah a bark from Florida loaded with Cardinalbird's skins and fruits The Spaniards bought the Cardinalbirds at so high a price as ten dol∣lars apiece and notwithstanding the public distress spent on them the sum of dollars"  GEMELLI CARERI  so that there is no reason to doubt that these birds are of distinct species  It is accurately described by Brisson He has properly observed that the red colour of its plu∣mage is much lighter than in the Scarlet Ta∣nagre The superior coverts of the wings and the two quills next the body are black all the other quills of the wings are brown and edged interiorly with white to their extremity the tail consists of twelve black quills terminated by a small border of light white the lateral quills are rather longer than those of the middle which makes the tail somewhat forked  Specific character of the  Tanagra Rubra  "It is red its wings and tail black its tailquills black at the tip"  Thus described by BRISSON  "Its wingquills are dusky their inner edges white the coverts of the wings and its tailquills black the margin of the latter white at the tips"  The MISSISSIPPI TANAGRE  Tanagra Mississippensis  Gmel  Sixth Species  This is a new species It resembles much the Canada Tanagre only its wings and tail are not black but of the same colour with the rest of the body Its bill is larger and thicker than in any of the Tanagres and also the mandibles are convex and inflated which is uncommon even in any kind of the birdsThis character is badly expressed in the  Planches Enluminées  It is much inferior to the Scarlet Tanagre in point of song It whistles so loud and so shrill that it would stun one in the house and is fit only to be heard in the fields or the woods  "In summer" says Dupratz "we frequently hear this Cardinal in the forests and in winter only on the banks of rivers after it has drank during that season it never quits it lodgment but guards the provisions which it has stored Sometimes it collects as much as a Paris bushel of maize which it covers artfully with leaves and then with small branches or sticks and al∣lows only a small opening by which to enter into its magazine"  Specific character  "It is entirely red"  The BLACKFACED TANAGRE  Le Camail  ou  la Cravatte  Buff  Tanagra Atra  Gmel  Tanagra Melanopis  Lath  Seventh Species  This new species was presented to the king's cabinet by Sonini de Manoncour Its plumage is of an uniform cinereous somewhat lighter under the belly except the forepart and the back of the head of the throat and of the top of the breast which are spread with black The wings and the tail are also cinereous but deeper  cast than the upperpart of the body the quills of the wings are edged exteriorly with a lighter ashcolour and those of the tail with a still more dilute shade  This bird is the seventh of this genus in point of size Its total length is seven inches the bill nine lines the upper mandible white at the base and black at the tip the lower is en∣tirely black the tail is somewhat tapered three inches and one fourth long and projects two inches beyond the closed wings  It is found in Guiana in the cleared spots but is very rare and has been noticed by no author  Specific character  "It is cinereous the foreside of its head and the whole of the lower part of its neck are black"  The BLACKHEADED TANAGRE  Le Mordoré  Buff  Tanagra Atricapilla  Gmel  Eighth Species  This is also a new species and presented by Sonini It is of the same size with the preced∣ing its length seven inches its head wings and tail of a fine glossy black the rest of the body gilded dark brown deeper on the forepart of the neck and on the breast its legs are brown its tail though tapered is three inches  long and projects fifteen lines beyond the wings the bill is black and nine lines long  We are totally unacquainted with its habits It is found in Guiana and is still more rare than the preceding  Specific character of the  Tanagra Atricapilla  "It is ru∣fousred its head wings and tail black with a black furrow on the wings"  The FURROWCLAWED TANAGRE  L'Onglet  Buff  Tanagra Striata  Gmel  Ninth Species  The nails have on each side a small furrow running parallel to the edges It was brought by Commerson and as it resembles the Ta∣nagres in every other respect it is more than probable that it came from South America  The head of this bird is striped with black and blue the anterior part of the back is black∣ish and the posterior bright orange the upper coverts of the tail olive brown the upper co∣verts of the wings their quills and those of the tail are black edged exteriorly with blue all the underpart of the body is yellow  Total length near seven inches the bill eight lines and furrowed near the point as in the Tanagres the tarsus nine lines and the mid∣toe the same  Commerson has left no particulars with regard to its habits  Specific character of the  Tanagra Striata  "It is black yellow below its head striped with coerulean and black the lowest part of its back orange"  The BLACK TANAGRE and the RUFOUS TANAGRE  Tenth Species  Sonini informs us that these constitute only one species and that the one represented  Pl Enl No    fig  is the male and that of  No  the female The female is entirely rufous and the male entirely black except a white spot on the top of each wingThey are common in the cleared parts of Guiana and like the others eat small fruits and sometimes in∣sects Their cry is shrill and they have no song They appear in pairs and never in flocks  The TURQUOISE TANAGRE  Le Turquin  Buff  Tanagra Brasiliensis  Linn  Tanagra Brasiliensis Caerulea  Briss and Klein  Elotototl  seu  Avis Spicae Mayzii  Ray  Eleventh Species  All the lower parts of the body the upperpart of the head and the sides of the neck are  deep or turquoiseblue the forehead the wings and the tail are black there are also some spots of black near the legs and a broad bar of the same below the breastThis bird is found in Guiana but is not frequent  The REDBREASTED TANAGRE  Le Bec D'Argent  Buff  Tanagra Jacapa  Linn  Lanius Carbo  Pall  Cardinalis Purpurea  Briss  Twelfth Species  The French settlers in Cayenne have given this bird the name of  SilverBill Becd' Argent  which expresses a remarkable specific character viz that the base of the lower mandible ex∣tends under the eyes and forms on each side a thick plate which when the bird is alive looks like the brightest silver but this lustre tarnishes after death It is imperfectly represented in the  Planches Enluminées  Edwards has given an ex∣cellent figure of this bird under the name of  Redbreasted Blackbird  he is deceived indeed in regard to the genus but he has hit the dis∣criminating features  The total length is six inches and a half and that of the bill nine lines which is black on the  upperpart the head throat and breast are purple and the rest of the body black with some purple tints The iris is brown The fe∣male differs from the male not only in the colour of its bill but in those of its plumage the upperpart of its body is brown with some shades of obscure purple and the underpart reddish the tail and wings are brown  Another discriminating character of the male is a sort of half collar round the occiput formed by long purple bristles which project near three lines beyond the feathers We are indebted to Sonini for this remark and also for our ac∣quaintance with this and all the other Tanagres of Guiana  This bird is more numerous than any of the Tanagres in the Island of Cayenne and in Guiana and it probably occurs in many other warm countries of America for Fernandez gives the same account of a Mexican bird that fre∣quents the vicinity of the mountains of Tepuz∣cullula It feeds upon small fruits and also upon the large pulpy produce of the bananas c when they are ripe but eats no insects It haunts the clearest spots and does not shun the neighbourhood of dwellings and even visits the gardens However the Redbreasted Tana∣gres are also very common in desert tracts and even in the glades of the forests for in spots where the trees are levelled by the hurricanes and where the sun darts his burning rays there  are generally some of these birds though al∣ways in pairs and never in flocks  Their nest is cylindrical and somewhat curved which they fasten horizontally between the branches the entrance being below so that the rain from whatever direction it beats can∣not penetrate It is six inches long and four inches and a half in diameter it is constructed with straws and the dry leaves of the Indian flowering reed  Canna Indica  Linn  and the bottom is well lined with broader portions of the same leavesit is generally fixed in the loftiest trees The female lays two elliptical eggs which are white and covered at the thick end with small spots of light red which melts away as it approaches the other end  Some nomenclators have given this bird the name of Cardinal but improperly others have supposed that there is an obvious variety in this species In Mauduit's cabinet we saw a bird whose plumage is pale rosecolour variegated with gray I am rather inclined to think that this difference is occasioned by moulting  Specific character of the  Tanagra Jacapa  "It is black its front throat and breast scarlet"  Thus described by Bris∣son  Male  "dull purple the quills of the wings and of the tail and the thighs glossy black"  Female  "above dusky mixed with dull purple below tawny the quills of the wings and of the tail dusky"  The Mexican name is  Chichiltototl  The SAINT DOMINGO TANAGRE  L'Esclave  Buff  Tanagra Dominica  Linn Gmel and Briss  Thirteenth Species  This Tanagre is called the  Slave  in Saint Do∣mingo and yet we are not told whether it can be bred in a cage or is gentle and familiar as the name seems to import Perhaps it owes the appellation to this circumstancethe Crested Flycatcher in Saint Domingo and the Forked∣tail Flycatcher of Canada are termed  Tyrants  and are much larger and stronger than this bird which also feeds on insects  The Saint Domingo Tanagre bears some re∣semblance to the Thrushes the colours and par∣ticularly the speckles on the breast are similar in both and like the rest of its genus it has the upper mandible scalloped  The head the upperpart of the neck the back the rump the scapular feathers and the superior coverts of the wings are of an uniform colour all the underpart of the body is of a dirty white varied with brown spots that occupy the middle of each feather the wingquills are brown edged exteriorly with olive and interiorly with dirtywhite the two middle quills of the tail are brown the rest of  the same colour with an olive border on their innerside the tail is somewhat forked the legs are brown  Specific character of the  Tanagra Dominica  "It is spotted with black above duskyolive below whitish"  Thus described by Brisson  "Above dusky below dirtywhite varie∣gated with dusky longitudinal spots the quills of its wings and of its tail dusky their outeredges olive"  THE BISHOP TANAGRE  The BISHOP TANAGRE  Le Bluet  Buff  TanagraEpiscopus  Linn Gmel Briss and Saler  The Syacu  Edw  Fourteenth Species  It is larger than those which form the second division of Tanagres  Some sentences are omitted here containing the author's reasons for rejecting the appellation given this bird of  Cayenne Bishop  and for adopting that of  Bluet  In the male all the upperpart of the body is bluishgray and in the female all the upperpart of the head is of a yellowishgreen and all the upperpart of the body the back the upper surface of the quills the wings and of the tail olivebrown glossed with violet the broad bar on the wings which is lightolive is distinguished from the brown on the back  These birds are very common in Cayenne they haunt the skirts of the forests plantations and places that have been long cleared where they feed upon small fruits They are never seen in large bodies but always in pairs They lodge at night among the leaves of the palm∣trees at their junction near the stem and make nearly the same noise that our Sparrows do among the willows for they have no song and their cry is sharp and unpleasant  Specific character of the  TanagraEpiscopus  It is cinere∣ous its wings

wings when closed appear of a green running into blue the quills of the tail the same colour except the two intermediate ones which are green  Brisson to whom we are indebted for what we know of this bird tells us that it is found in Mexico Peru and Brazil  Specific character of the  Tanagra Virens  "It is green yellow below its straps and throat black with a blue stripe on its jaw"  The OLIVE TANAGRE  L'Olivet  Buff  Tanagra Olivacea  Gmel  Seventeenth Species  We have given this name because the plu∣mage is of an olivegreen deeper on the upper∣part of the body and lighter on the under the

this bird is the  Teoauhtototl  of Fernandez but this naturalist only says that it is about the size of a Sparrow its bill short the upperpart of the body blue and the under yellowish white with black wings from a de∣scription so incomplete it is impossible to decide the identity Fernandez adds that the  Teoauh∣tototl  frequents the valleys and hills of  Tetzocan  in Mexico that it is good eating that its song is unpleasant and that it is not bred in houses  Specific character of the  Tanagra Mexicana  "It is black below yellowish its breast and rump blue"  Thus de∣scribed by Brisson  "Above

un∣acquainted with its history  The RUFOUSHEADED TANAGRE  This bird was by mistake ranked among the Sparrows it is now restored to its proper place    Le Passevert  Buff  Tanagra Cayana  Linn and Gmel  Tanagra Cayanensis Viridis  Briss  The upperpart of the head is rufous the upperpart of the neck the lowerpart of the back and the rump are of a palegold yellow shining like raw silk and in certain positions there ap∣pears a delicate tint of green the sides of the head are black the higherpart of the back the scapular feathers the small superior coverts of the wings and those of the tail are green  The throat is bluegray the rest of the underpart of the body shines with a confused  mixture of palegold yellow rufous and bluegray and each of these predominates according to the light in which the bird is viewed the quills of the wings and of the tail are brown with a border of goldgreen  In some individuals the rufous at the top of the head de∣scends much lower on the neck in others this colour extends on the one hand upon the breast and the belly and on the other upon the neck and all the upperside of the body and the green of the wingfeathers has a changing blue cast    In the female the upperpart of the body is green and the under of a dullyellow with some greenish reflexions  These birds are very common in Cayenne where the Creoles call them  Dauphinois  they in∣habit only the cleared tracts and even come near the plantations they feed on fruits and destroy vast quantities of bananas and Indian pears they consume also the crops of rice when in maturity the male and female commonly follow each other but they do not fly in flocks only a number of them is sometimes seen together among fields of riceThey have no song or warble and only a short shrill cry  Specific character of the  Tanagra Cayana  "It is ful∣vous its back green its cap rufous its cheeks black"  VARIETY  Le PasseVert à T^te Bleue  Buff  Linnaeus describes a bird resembling much the preceding The forepart of the neck the breast and the belly are goldenyellow the back greenishyellow the wings and the tail green without any mixture of yellow It differs however in having its head of a bright blue  The GREENHEADED TANAGRE  Le Tricolor  Buff  Tanagra Tricolor  Gmel  Tanagra Cayanensis varia Chlorocephalos  Briss  Fourth Middle Species  Brought from Cayenne by Sonini The plu∣mage consists of three colours red green and blue which are all very bright The two birds represented in N  o  of the  Planches Enlumineés  seem to belong to the same species and perhaps differ only in sex for in the one the head is green and in the other blue in the former the upperpart of the neck is red and in the latter greenand these are almost the sole differences  We have seen in the cabinet of M Aubri Rector of St Louis one of these in high pre∣servation and said to have come from the Straits of Magellan but it is not very probable that the same bird should inhabit the torrid cli∣mate of Cayenne and the dreary frozen tracts of Patagonia  The GRAY TANAGRE  Le GrisOlive  Buff  Tanagra Grisea  Gmel  Fifth Middle Species  The underpart of the body is gray the upper olive It occurs both in Guiana and Louisiana  The PARADISE TANAGRE  Le Septicolor  Buff  Tanagra Tatao  Linn and Gmel  Avicula de Tatao  Seba  Tanagra  Ray Will and Briss  The Titmouse of Paradise  Edw  Sixth Middle Species  The plumage is variegated with seven co∣lours fine green on the head and the small superior coverts of the wings glossy black on the upperparts of the neck and back on the middle quills of the wings and on the upper  surface of the quills of the tail brilliant firecolour on the back orangeyellow on the rump violetblue on the throat the lowerpart of the neck and the great superior coverts of the wings deep gray on the undersurface of the tail and lastly fine seagreen on all the underpart of the body from the breast These colours are all exceed∣ingly bright and well defined  It does not assume the vivid red on the back till grown up and the female never has that co∣lour the lowerpart of her back too is orange like the rump and in general her tints are more dilute and not so distinctly desined as those of the maleBut there is still some diversity in the disposition of the colours some males have the bright red on the rump as well as on the back and in many others both the back and rump are entirely of a gold colour  The male and female are nearly of the same size being five inches long the bill only six lines and the legs eight lines the tail is some∣what forked and the wings reach to the middle of it  These birds appear in numerous flocks They feed upon the tender halfformed fruits which grow on a certain large tree in Guiana They arrive in the island of Cayenne when this tree is in blossom and depart soon afterwards pene∣trating probably into the interior parts of the country when the same fruits are later in com∣ing to maturity They make their appearance in  the inhabited parts of Guiana commonly about the middle of September and stay about six weeks they return again in April or May Indeed they seem to seek always the same food and when any of those trees is in blow we may certainly expect to find a number of these birds  They breed not during their residence in Gui∣ana Marcgrave tells us that in Brazil they are kept in the cage and fed on meal and bread They have no warble and their cry is short and sharp  We must not with Brisson range the  Talao  with this species for the description given by Seba is not at all applicable to it  "The Talao" says Seba "has its plumage beautifully varie∣gated with pale green with black with yellow and with white the feathers of the head and breast are finely shaded with pale green and with black and the bill the legs and the toes are deep black"  Besides what demonstratively proves it to be not the same bird the author adds that it is very rare in Mexico whereas the Paradise Tanagres we have seen arrive there in very great numbers  The BLUE TANAGRE  Tanagra Mexicana  var Gmel  Tanagra Barbadensis Caerula  Briss  Seventh Middle Species  Its head throat and the underpart of the neck are of a fine blue the back of the head  the upperpart of the neck the back the wings and the tail black the superior coverts of the wings black and edged with blue the breast and the rest of the underpart of the body fine white  On comparing this with what Seba calls the  American Sparrow  they appear to be the same differing only perhaps in age and sex Brisson seems to have amplified the imperfect account of Seba but as he does not produce his autho∣rities we cannot lay any weight on his descrip∣tion  Seba's bird came from Barbadoes ours from Cayenne  The BLACKTHROATED TANAGRE  Eighth Middle Species  This species is new It was found in Guiana and brought home by Sonini de Manoncour  The head and all the upperpart of the body olivegreen the throat black the breast orange the sides of the neck and all the underpart of the body fine yellow the superior coverts of the wings the quills of the wings and of the tail brown and edged with olive the upper mandible black the lower gray and the legs blackish  The HOODED TANAGRE  La Coiffe Noire  Buff  Tanagra Pileata  Gmel  Ninth Middle Species  The total length of this bird is four inches and ten lines its bill is black and nine lines long all the underpart of the body is white slightly varied with cinereous the upperpart of the head is glossy black which extends on each side of the neck in a black bar distinctly marked on the white ground of the throat which makes the bird look as if it were hooded with black The quills of the tail are not tapered and are all twentyone lines long and extend an inch be∣yond the wings the legs are nine lines long  The  Tiyepiranga  of Marcgrave which Brisson terms the  Cinereous Tanagre of Brazil  would resemble this bird exactly if Marcgrave had mentioned the black hood and this renders it probable that the one which we have described is the male and that of Marcgrave the female of the same species  They are found in Brazil and Guiana but we are not acquainted with their history  SMALL TANAGRES  The middlesized Tanagres which have been above enumerated are in general not larger than a LinnetThose which we are going to describe are sensibly smaller and exceed not the size of a Wren  The REDHEADED TANAGRE  Le Rouverdin  Formed from  Rouxverd  Buff  TanagraGyrola  Linn and Gmel  Tanagra Peruviana Viridis  Briss  Fringilla Pectore Coeruleo  Klein  Fringilla Viridis Capite Spadiceo  Act Petr  The Redheaded Greenfinch  Edw  First Small Species  Its head is green its body entirely rufous except a light blue spot on the breast and a yellow spot on the top of the wing  This species appears in many parts of South America in Peru  Edwards  Surinam  Brisson  and Cayenne It would seem that it migrates for it is not found in the same place the whole year It arrives in Guiana twice or thrice annually to feed upon small fruit that grows on a large tree on which it perches in flocks and again departs probably after the provisions are consumed As these birds are not frequent and always avoid  the cleared and inhabited spots their habits have not been observed  Specific character of the  TanagraGyrola  "It is green its head red its collar yellow its breast blue"  The SYACU TANAGRE  Second Small Species  The two birds represented in the  Planches Enluminées  No fig No fig seem to belong to the same species and differ perhaps only in the sex It is likely that the whitebellied one is the female and the greenbellied one the male  We give them the name of  Syacou  con∣tracted from the Brazilian appellation  Sayacou  for we have no doubt that what Brisson terms the  Variegated Tanagre of Brazil  is the same kind  These two birds were brought from Cayenne where they are rare  The last of these birds is the  TanagraSyaca  of Gmelin the  Tanagra Brasiliensis Varia  of Brisson Its specific character  "Hoary its wings somewhat blue"  The first is the  Tanagra Punctata  of Gmelin the  Tanagra Viridis Indica Punctata  of Bris∣son and the  Spotted Tanager  of Latham Its specific character  "Green dotted with black below yellowish white"  THE SMALL TANAGRE  The ORGANIST  Third Small Species  Such is the name this little bird receives at St Domingo because it sounds all the notes of the octave rising from the base to the treble This sort of song which implies that the ear of this bird is organized similarly to the human ear is not only singular but very pleasant The Chevalier Fabre Deshayes has informed me in a letter that in the south of St Domingo on the high mountains there is a small bird very rare and famous called the  Musician  whose song can be written We presume that this is the same with the  Organist  But still we should doubt of the regular succession of musical sounds for we had not the bird alive It was presented by the Count de Noë who had brought it from the Spanish district of St Domingo where he told me it was very rare and difficult to discover or to shoot because it is shy and artfully con∣ceals itself it even turns round the branch as the hunter changes place to elude his view so that though there be several of these birds on a tree it often happens that not one of them can be perceived  The length four inches the plumage blue on the head and neck the back the wings and the tail are stained with black running  into coarse blue the forehead the rump and all the upperpart of the body coloured with orangecolourThis short description is suffi∣cient to discriminate it  We find in Dupratz's History of Louisiana the description of a small bird which he calls  Bishop  and which we believe to be the same with the  Organist  "The Bishop is a bird smaller than the Canary its plumage is blue verging on violetIt feeds on many sorts of small seeds among these  widlogouil  and  choupi∣choul  a kind of millet peculiar to the country Its notes are so flexible its warble so tender that when we once hear it we become more reserved in our eulogiums on this nightingale Its song lasts during a  Miserere  and during the whole time it never makes an inspiration it rests twice as long before it renews its music the whole interval elapsed being about two hours"  Though Dupratz does not mention whether it gives the notes of the octaves as the Organist is said to do we cannot doubt their identity for the colours and size are the same in both The Scarlet Tanagre which resembles it in point of song is twice as large and the Arada which has also a charming warble is entirely brown The Organist is then the only bird to which it can be referred  The JACARINI TANAGRE  Le Jacarini  Buff  Tanagra Jacarina  Linn and Gmel  Tanagra Brasiliensis Nigra  Briss  Carduelis Brasiliana  Will and Edw  Fourth Small Species  This bird was called  Jacarini  by the Brazilians Marcgrave mentions it but takes no notice of its habits However Sonini de Manoncour who observed it in Guiana where it is very common informs us that it prefers the cleared grounds and is never seen in the large forests that it lodges in the low trees particularly the coffee∣tree and is distinguished by a singular circum∣stance viz that it springs from the branch on which it has perched a foot or a foot and a half vertically and falls back to the same spot and thus continues to rise and sink alternately till it removes to another bush where it repeats the same exercise Each leap is attended with a seeble cry expressive of pleasure and by an ex∣pansion of the tail This would seem to be the mode in which the male courts the female which on the contrary remains at ease or hops about like other birds The nest is composed of dry herbs of a gray colour it is hemispheri∣cal and two inches in diameter the female deposits in it two elliptical eggs seven or eight lines long and of a greenish white sprinkled  with small red spots which are numerous and spread most profusely near the big end  The Jacarini is easily known by its colour which is black and shining like polished steel and uniform over the whole body except only in the male the interior coverts of the wings which are whitish for the female is entirely gray and differs so much in plumage that it might be taken for a different species The male also be∣comes gray in the moult  Specific character of the  Tanagra Jacarina  "It is blackviolet its wings whitish below its tail wideforked"  The GOLDEN TANAGRE  Le Teité  Buff Ray and Will  Tanagra Violacea  Linn Gmel Borowsk c  Tanagra Brasiliensis NigroLutea  Briss  The Golden Titmouse  Edw  Fifth Small Species  It is called  Teité  in its native region of Brazil The female differs widely from the male for the upperpart of the body is olivegreen the forehead and the underpart of the bill tinged partly with yellow and partly with oliveyellow whereas in the male the body is of a deep blue and the forehead the underpart of the throat and belly fine yellow  In the young bird the colours are somewhat different The upperpart of the body is olive  sprinkled with some feathers of a deep blue and on the front the yellow is not distinctly marked The feathers are only gray with a little yellow at the tips the underside of the body is of as fine a yellow in the young bird as in the adult  The same changes of plumage are observed in this as in the preceding species The nest is also very like that of the Jacarini only it is not of so close a texture and is composed of reddish herbs instead of gray There is a variety of it which as well as the species is called  Little Louis  by the Creoles of Cayenne They are both very com∣mon in Guiana Surinam and Brazil they fre∣quent the ground cleared near the farmhouse and feed on the small fruits which they find on the bushes they light in great numbers among ricecrops which must be guarded against their visits  They may be bred in the cage where they are pleasant if five or six be put together They whistle like the Bullfinch and are fed on the plants called in Brazil  Paco  and  Mamao  Specific character of the  Tanagra Violaces  "It is violet below very yellow"  The NEGRO TANAGRE  Le Tanagra Nègre  Buff  Tanagra Cayanensis  Gmel  Tanagra Cayana  Linn  Tanagra Cayanensis Nigra  Briss  Sixth Small Species  This bird is of so deep a blue as to appear quite black and it requires a close inspection to perceive some blue reflexions on its plumage it has an orangespot on each side of the breast but covered by the wing so that the general appearance is uniform black  It is of the same size with the preceding and inhabits the same countries but is much rarer in Guiana  Specific character of the  Tanagra Cayanensis  "It is shin∣ing black both sides of its breast and its wings yellow"  These are all the Great the Middlesized and the Small Tanagres whose species can be ascertained with accuracy A few remain that have been described by Brisson but on the cre∣dit of authors whose accounts are vague and in∣correct I shall however enumerate them with∣out pretending to decide the species  First  The Grass bird  or  Xiuhtototl  of Fernan∣dez All the body is blue scattered with some fulvous feathers those of the tail black and tipt  with white the underpart of the wings cine∣reous the upperpart variegated with blue with fulvous and with black the bill short somewhat thick and of a rusty white the legs are gray  This author adds that it is somewhat larger than our Housesparrow that it is good eating that it is raised in the cage and that its song is not unpleasantIt is impossible from such an imperfect account to decide whether it belongs to the genus of Tanagres  This is the  Coerulean Tanagre  of Latham the  Tanagra Canora  of Gmelin and the  Tanagra Coerulea Novae Hispaniae  of Brisson  Secondly  The Mexican Bird  of Seba  of the size of a Sparrow  The whole body is blue varied with purple except the wings which are varied with red and black the head is round the eyes and the breast are covered above and below with a blackish down the inferior co∣verts of the wings and of the tail are yellowish ashcolour It is ranged among the singing birds  So vague an account cannot warrant us to conclude that it belongs to the genus of the Tanagres for the only points of analogy are that it inhabits Mexico and is of the size of a Sparrow and Seba's figure as indeed all those of that author can convey no distinct idea  Thirdly  The Brazilian GuiraPerea  of Marc∣grave It is about the bulk of a Lark its bill black short and rather thick all the upperpart of the body and the belly of a deep yel∣low  spotted with black the underpart of the head and neck the throat and the breast black the wings and tail composed of quills of blackish brown and some edged exteriorly with green the legs are of a dull cinereous  It does not appear from this short description whether this bird ought to be referred to the Bulfinches or to the Tanagres  This is the  Yellow Tanagre  of Latham the  Tanagra Flava  of Gmelin and the  Brasiliensis  of Brisson  Fourthly  The Bird smaller than the Goldfinch  or  the Quatoztli of Brazil  according to Seba The half of its head is decorated with a white crest the neck is of a light red and the breast of a fine purple the wings deep red and purple the back and the tail yellowish black and the belly light yellow the bill and legs are yellow Seba adds that it inhabits the mountains of  Tet∣zocano  in Brazil  We shall observe first that the name  Qua∣toztli  which Seba gives to this bird is not Bra∣zilian but Mexican and secondly that the mountains of  Tetzocano  are in Mexico and not in Brazil It is probable therefore that he was mistaken in calling it a Brazilian bird  Lastly from the description and the figure given by Seba we should rather range this bird in the genus of the Manakins than in that of the Tanagres  This is the  Whiteheaded Tanagre  or  Tanagra Albifrons  of Latham the  Tanagra Leucocephala  of Gmelin and the  Tanagra Brasiliensis Leucocephalus  of Brisson  Fifthly  The Calatti  of Seba which is nearly of the size of a Lark and has a black crest on the head and the sides of the head and the breast of a fine skycolour the back is black variegated with azure the superior coverts blue with a purple spot the quills of the wings variegated with green with deep blue and with black the rump variegated with pale blue and green and the belly with snowy white the tail is of a beautiful form brown terminated with rufous  Seba adds that this bird which was sent from Amboyna is of an elegant figure his plate is a very bad one and that its song is also pleasant This is enough to exclude the  Calatti  from the Tanagres which are found only in America and in no part of the East Indies  This is the  Amboina Tanagre  of Latham the  Tanagra Am∣boinensis  of Gmelin and the  Tanagra Amboinensis Coerulea  of Brisson  Sixthly  The Anonymous Bird  of Hernandez The upperpart of its head is blue the upperpart of the body is variegated with green and black the underpart yellow and spotted with white the wings and the tail are deep green with spots of lighter green the legs are brown and the toes and nails very long  Hernandez subjoins in a corollary that this bird has a blackhooked bill and that if it were more curved and if the toes were placed as in the parrots he should not hesitate to regard it as a real parrot  From these indications we should refer this bird to the Shrikes  Seventhly  The Brown Cardinal  of Brisson which is a tropic bird and not a Tanagre  This is the  Military Tanagre  of Latham the  Greater Bul∣finch  or  Shirley  of Edwards the  Tanagra Militaris  of Linnaeus and Gmelin and the  Cardinalis Fuscus  of Brisson  The SILENT BIRD  Latham ranges it with the Tanagres with the epithet  Silens  Its specific character  "It is green its head and the underpart of its body hoary its eyebrows a fillet on its eyes and a stripe on its throat black"    We cannot refer this bird to any genus and we place it after the Tanagres only because its exterior appearance is similar but its habits are totally different It never appears in the cleared spots and remains always alone in the heart of the forests far from settlements and has no song or cry It rather hops than flies and seldom rests on the lowest branches of the bushes for it commonly continues on the ground It re∣sembles the Tanagres however in the shape of its body and feet and in the slight scalloping on both sides of the bill which is longer than the bill of the TanagresIt is a native of the same climate of America  THE BUNTING  The ORTOLAN BUNTING  In German  FetAmmer  FatBunting  JutVogel  in Polish  Ogrodniczek    L'Ortolan  Buff  Emberiza Hortulana  Linn Gmel Fris Mull  Hortulanus  Bris Aldrov c  Ortolano  Zinn and Olin  IT is very probable that our Ortolan is no other than the  Miliaria  of Varro so called be∣cause it was fattened with millet seeds it seems also to be the same with the  Cenchramus  Aristotle spells the name  not  Pliny in∣deed writes it both  Cynchramus  and  Cenchramus  yet the etymology given in the text seems doubtful  of Aristotle and Pliny which is evidently derived from  that likewise signifies  millet  And these etymological conjectures acquire force from the correspondence between the properties of these birds  The  Cenchramus  is a bird of passage which according to Aristotle and Pliny accompanies the Quails in the same way as the Rails the Snipes and other migratory birds  Hist Anim  Lib  viii Hist Nat  Lib  x    The  Cenchramus  utters cries during the night which has given to these naturalists oc∣casion to say that it continually calls to the  companions of its journey and encourages them to advance  Lastly in the time of Varro the  Miliariae  as well as the Quails and Thrushes were fat∣tened and sold at high prices to the luxurious  De Re Rustica  Lib  iii    All these properties belong to our OrtolanIt is a bird of passage which a multitude of naturalists and of fowlers admit it sings during the night as Kramer Frisch and Salerne affirm  I could cite also the Sieur Burel gardener at Lyons who has sometimes above an hundred Ortolans in his volery and who com∣municated to me or confirmed many peculiarities of their history  and lastly when fat it is esteemed a delicious morsel  It is pretended those caught in the plains of Toulouse are better flavoured than those of Italy In winter they are very scarce and consequently very dear they are dispatched to Paris by post in a small trunk filled with millet according to the historian of Languedoc  tome  i  p  in the same manner as they are sent from Bologna and Florence to Rome in boxes full of corn ac∣cording to Aldrovandus  The Ortolans are not always caught fat but there is an in∣fallible method to bring them into that state They are shut up in a room from which the ex∣ternal light is excluded but which is constantly illuminated with lanthorns so that they cannot distinguish the night from the day they are allowed to run about and pick up the oats and millet that are regularly scattered in the apart∣ment With this regimen they soon grow excessively fat and if not prevented would even die of extreme corpulence  It has been said that they are sometimes fattened to weigh three ounces  When killed at the proper time they are most delicate delici∣ous  balls of fat but rather too luscious and apt to cloyThus Nature guards against intempe∣rance by the satiety and disgust which constantly attend the excess of pleasure  The fat Ortolans are easily dressed in the waterbath the sandbath in hot ashes c And they may be also very well prepared in the shell of a real or an artificial egg as was for∣merly practised with the beccafigos or epicurean warblers  Petronius    It cannot be denied that the delicacy of their flesh or rather of their fat has contributed more to their celebrity than the charms of their warble However when kept in the cage they have a song like that of the Yellow Bunting which as I have already observed they repeat night and day In countries where they are numerous and consequently well known as in Lombardy they are not only fattened for the table but trained to sing and Salerne observes that there is a sweetness in their notes In this case they are better treated and not being suffered to grow corpulent their lives are prolonged If they are kept a considerable time beside other birds they adopt something of their song especially when they are young but I know not whether they ever learn to articulate words or catch the notes of our music  These birds make their appearance at the same time with our Swallow or a little after and they  either accompany or precede the Quails They enter Lower Provence and advance as far as Burgundy especially in the warm districts which are planted with vineyards however they touch not the grapes but eat the insects that prey upon the leaves and tendrils of the vines On their arrival they are rather lean because then is the season of their loves  They may however be fatted at this time by feeding them first with oats then with hempseed with millet c  They build in the vines and their nests are pretty regular and similar to those of the lark they lay four or five grayish eggs and have commonly two hatches in the year In other countries as in Lorraine they place their nests on the ground and prefer the cornfields  The young family begins to direct its course to the southern provinces as early as the first of August but the parents do not commence their journey before the end of September They remove into Fores and halt in the neighbour∣hood of St Chaumont and St Etienne they alight among the oats of which they are very fond and remain till the cold weather be∣gins to set in during which time they become so fat and inactive that they might be knocked down with sticks At this time they are proper for the table especially the young ones but they are more difficult to preserve than those which are caught in their first entrance In Bearn also the Ortolans appear twice annually passing in May and repassing in October  Some have supposed these birds to be natives of Italy whence they spread into Germany and other countries and this is not improbable for though they breed at present in Germany they are caught promiscuously with the Buntings and Chaffinches  FrischKramer ranks them among the birds which occur in Lower Austria and he adds that they live in the fields and perch upon the trees which grow in the midst of meadows  but Italy has been cultivated from a more remote antiquity Besides it is not uncommon for these birds when they dis∣cover a suitable country to adopt it and settle in it Not many years since they were thus naturalized in a small district of Lorraine lying between Dieuse and Mulée where they breed raise their young depart in the fall and return again in the spring  Dr Lottinger    But their journies are not confined to Ger∣many Linnaeus relates that they inhabit Swe∣den and fixes the month of March for the period of their migration  Fauna Suecica  We must not how∣ever suppose that they are spread through all the countries between Sweden and Italy they return constantly into our southern provinces sometimes their course lies through Picardy but scarcely are they ever seen in the northern part of Burgundy where I live in Brie or in Swit∣zerland c  Gesner  They may be caught either with the noose or with limedtwigs  In the male the throat is yellowish edged with cinereous the orbits also yellowish the breast the belly and the sides rufous with some speckles whence the Italian name  Tordino  From

ones with sulphuryellow the quills of the tail blackish edged with rust the two outer ones edged with white lastly the bill and legs are yellowish  The female has rather more cinereous on the head and on the neck and no yellow spot below the eye but in general the plumage of the Ortolan is subject to many varieties  The Ortolan is smaller than the House Spar∣row Length from six inches and onefourth to five inches and twothirds the bill five lines the leg nine lines the middle toe eight lines the alar extent nine inches the tail two inches and a half consisting of twelve quills and pro∣jecting eighteen or twenty lines beyond the wings  Specific character of the Ortolan  EmberizaHortulana  "Its wingquills dusky the first three whitish at the margin the tailquills dusky the two lateral ones black exteriorly"  It is six inches and onefourth long It builds in low bushes or on the ground a nest like that of the Skylark and lays four or five gray eggs  VARIETIES of the ORTOLAN  I The YELLOW ORTOLAN Aldrovandus who observed this variety says that its plumage was strawcoloured except the wingquills which were tipt with white and the outermost edged with the same colour another peculi∣arity the bill and legs were red  II The WHITE ORTOLAN Aldrovandus compares its whiteness to that of the swan and says that all its plumage was uniformly the same Burel of Lyons who has long been employed in raising Ortolans assures me that he has seen some grow white from age  III The BLACKISH ORTOLAN Burel has seen others which were undoubtedly of a different character from the preceding and which became blackish as they grew old In the one observed by Aldrovandus the head and neck were green with a little white on the head and on two quills of the wing the bill was red and the legs cine∣reous all the rest was blackish  IV The WHITETAILED ORTOLAN It dif∣fers from the common Ortolan by the colour of its tail and by the tints of its plumage which are fainter  V I have observed one in which the throat was yellow mixed with gray the breast gray and the belly rufous  The REED BUNTING  In Greek      from    a rush    Rush Sparrow  perhaps from  a  thorn  in German  RhorSpar RhorSperling  or

Torquatus  seu  Arundinaceus  Ray Will Briss  Emmerling  Gunth Nest  UPON comparing the different birds of this fa∣mily I have perceived so many striking re∣lations between that of the present article and those of the four following that I should have referred them all to the same species if I could have collected a sufficient number of facts to justify this innovation It is extremely probable that all these would propagate with each other and that the crossbreed would be prolific But still I observe that they continue for a length of time in the same country without intermixing that they retain their discriminating characters and that their instincts are not quite the same I shall therefore follow the common division but protest against the multiplication of the number of species which is so fertile a source of error and confusion  The Reed Ortolans delight in fens and nestle among the rushes however they sometimes resort to the high grounds in rainy seasons In spring they are seen by the sides of the roads and in August they feed in the corn fields Kra∣mer tells us that they are fondest of millet In general they seek their food like the Buntings along the hedges and in the cultivated spots They keep near the ground and seldom perch except on the bushes They never assemble in flocks and scarcely more than three or four are seen at once They arrive in Lorraine about the month of April and depart in au∣tumn however there are always some of them which continue in that province during the winterThey are found in Sweden Germany England France and sometimes in Italy c  This little bird is almost perpetually on the watch to discover its foe and when it de∣scries some fowlers it makes an incessant cry which is not only teazing but sometimes scares away the game I have seen sportsmen quite out of patience at the notes of this bird which are somewhat like those of the Sparrow The Reed Bunting has besides a pleasant warble in the time of hatching about the month of May  This bird jerks its tail upwards and down∣wards as quick as the Wagtails and with more animation  In the male the upperpart of the head is black the throat and the forepart of the neck variegated with black and rusty gray a white collar on the upperpart of the neck only a sort of eyebrow and a bar of the same colour under the eyes the upperpart of the body variegated with rufous and black the rump and the superior coverts of the tail variegated with gray and rusty the underpart of the body white shaded with rusty the sides slightly spotted with blackish the quills of the wings brown edged with different shades of rufous the quills of the tail the same except the two outermost on each side which are edged with white the bill is brown and the legs are of a dark fleshcolour  The female has no collar its throat is not so black and its head is variegated with black and light rufous the white which occurs in its plu∣mage is not pure but always sullied with a ru∣fous cast  Length from five

and projecting about fifteen lines beyond the wings  Specific character of the Reed Bunting  Emberiza Schoeni∣clus  "Its head is black its body gray and black the outer∣most quills of its tail marked with a wedgeshaped white spot"  It is five inches and threefourths long It is found as high as Denmark it is frequent in the southern parts of Russia and it visits Britain in the summer It suspends its nest between four reeds a few feet above the water this nest is made of grassstalks lined with the down of reeds The bird lays four or five eggs of a bluish white variegated with purple streaks It sings especially at night  The HOODED BUNTING  This bird is in the cabinet of Dr Mauduit who has called it the Siberian Reed Ortolan I have not ventured to adopt this appellation lest the subject should be found to be only a variety of our Reed Ortolan    Coqueluche  Buff  A sort of hood of a fine black covers the head throat and neck and then tapering to a point descends on the breast nearly in the same man∣ner as in the Reed Ortolan and this black is never interrupted except by a small white spot on each side very near the opening of the bill the rest of the underpart of the body is whitish but the sides are speckled with black The hood which I have mentioned is edged with white behind all the rest of the upperpart of the body variegated with rufous and blackish the quills of the tail are blackish but the two inter∣mediate ones are edged with rusty the two outermost have a large oblique spot the three others are uniform throughout  Total length five inches the bill six lines entirely black the tarsus nine lines the tail two inches rather forked and projects about thirteen lines beyond the wings  The MUSTACHOE BUNTING  Le Gavoué de Provence  Buff  Emberiza Provincialis

of the head and of the body varie∣gated with rufous and blackish the quills of the tail are divided by the same colours the rufous being exterior and apparent and the blackish being exterior and apparent and the blackish being within and concealed There is also a little whitish round the eyes and on the great coverts of the wings  This bird feeds on grain it is fond of perch∣ing and in the month of April its song is pleasant  This is a new species introduced by M Guys  Total length four inches and threefourths the bill five lines the tail twenty lines some∣what forked and stretching thirteen lines be∣yond the wings  Specific character of the  Emberiza Provincialis  "It is variegated with gray and black the underside of the body and a spot on its wings white a spot under the eye and stripe on the jaw black"  The LESBIAN BUNTING  Le Mitilene de Provence  Buff  Emeriza Lesbia  Gmel  This bird' differs in several respects from the preceding the black which appears on the sides of the head is disposed in three narrow stripes parted by white spaces the rump and the su∣perior coverts of the tail are shaded with several rufous tints But the difference of habits affords a more marked distinction the Lesbian Bunt∣ing does not begin its song before the month of June it is more rare and shyer and its repeated cries warn the other birds of the approach of the Kite of the Buzzard or of the Hawk in which circumstance it resembles the Reed Bunt∣ing The present inhabitants of Mytilene or ancient Lesbos employ it on this account as a sentinel for their poultry but take the precau∣tion to shut it in a strong cage lest itself become the prey of the ferocious invader  Specific character of the  Emberiza Lesbia  "It is varie∣gated with gray and black its undersurface and its orbits white has three stripes of black and white under its eyes its lateral tailquills partly white"  The LORRAINE BUNTING  L'Ortolan de Lorraine  Buff  Emberiza Lotharingica  Gmel  Lottinger

white but the outermost have always a greater share of white the bill is rufousbrown and the legs of a lighter shade  Total length six inches and a half the bill five lines and a half the tail two inches and four lines and exceeds the wings by fifteen lines  The female has a sort of collar mottled with rufous and white all the rest of the underpart of the body is rustywhite the upperpart of the head is variegated with black with rufous and with white but the black disappears behind the head and the rufous grows more dilute so  that an almost uniform rustygray is produced It has white eyebrows the cheeks are deep ru∣fous the bill orangeyellow at its base and black at its point the edges of the lower man∣dible are adapted into the upper the tongue is forked and the legs are black  One of these birds was brought to me the th of January it had been just killed on a stone in the middle of the highroad it weighed an ounce its intestines measured ten inches it had two very small

 Briss  This American bird has the same mottling of whitish and black on its head that is common to almost all our Ortolans but its tail instead of being forked is on the contrary somewhat ta∣pered The top of the head is marked with a black horseshoe which opens beside the bill and its branches extending above the eyes coalesce at the back of the head there are some other irregular spots below the eyes rufous pre∣dominates on all the lowerpart of the body being deeper on the breast and lighter above and below it the upperpart of the body is varie∣gated with rufous and black and so are the great and middle coverts and the quills of the wings next the body but all the other quills and the small coverts of the wings are black as well as the rump the tail and its superior coverts the bill has blackish spots on a rufous ground the legs are cinereous  Total length five inches and onefourth the bill five lines the tail two inches and onefourth consisting of twelve quills somewhat taper and projects fourteen lines beyond the wings  Specific character of the  Emberiza Ludoviciana  "It is rufous spotted with black below pale the breast rufous the head marked with a black arch"  The YELLOWBELLIED CAPE BUNTING  L'Ortolan à Ventre Jaune du Cape de BonneEsperance  Buff  Emberiza Capensis  var B Linn  We received this from Sonnerat It is the most beautiful of the genus its head is of

ashgray the uncovered part of the middle ones white the great ones brown edged with rufous the quills of the wings blackish edged with white except those next the body which are edged with rufous the third and fourth are the longest of all With respect to the quills of the tail the outermost and the one next it on each side are shorter than the rest so that were the tail equally divided though the whole be somewhat forked each of the parts is taper the greatest difference between the length of the quills is three lines  In the female the colours are less vivid and distinct Total length six

Finch  Alb  SeaLark  Ray  THE mountains of Spitzbergen the Lapland Alps the shores of Hudson'sbay and per∣haps countries still more northerly are during the summer months the favourite abodes of this bird The excessive severity of these inhospitable climates changes part of its plumage into white in winter  Those white feathers are black at the base and sometimes the black shines through the white and forms a multitude of little spots as in the individual painted by Frisch under the name of  The Spotted White Bunting  At other times the black collar of the base of each feather extends on a great part of the wing so that a blackish colour is thus produced over all the underside of the body as in the Blackish and Yellowish Finch of Aldrovandus  Lib XVIII pp    It has some variety of appearance from the diversified intermixture of white black or rusty and the combinations of these colours are affected by the season and by the tempera∣ture of the air  In winter the head the neck the coverts of the wings and all the underpart of the body are in the male white as snow with a light and almost transparent tint of rusty on the head only the back black the quills of the wings and of the tail partly black partly white In summer the head the neck the underpart of the body and even the back are stained with transverse rusty waves of various intensity but never so deep as in the female of which it is the predominant colour and disposed in longitudinal stripes In some subjects the neck is cinereous the back cinereous variegated with brown a purple tinge round the eyes a reddish cast on the head  Schwenckfeld  c The colour of the bill is also variable sometimes yellow sometimes cinereous at the base and generally black at the point In all the nostrils are round somewhat pro∣minent and covered with small feathers the tongue is a little forked the eyes are small and black the legs black or blackish  These birds leave their mountains when the snows and frosts will not permit them to pro∣cure their food This is the same with that of the white grous and consists of the seeds of a species of birch  The  Betula Nana  or  Dwars Birch  a native of the arctic re∣gions  and of other seeds When kept in the cage they are very well reconciled to oats and pluck the heads very expertly  with greenpease hempseed millet the seeds of dodder  Cuscuta Europaea  LINN  but hempseed fattens them too fast and occasions their death  They return in spring to their icy summits Though they do not always hold the same route they are commonly seen in Sweden in Saxony in Lower Silefia in Poland in Red Russia in Podolia and in Yorkshire  Willughby killed one in Lincolnshire Ray says that numbers of them are caught during winter in Yorkshire Johnson informed Willughby that some are seen on the chain of the Northumbrian mountains  They are very rare in the south of Germany and almost en∣tirely unknown in Switzerland and Italy  Gesner and Aldrovandus    In the time of their passage they keep con∣stantly along the roads picking up small seeds and every sort of food This is the proper sea∣son for catching them They are prized on account of the singularity of their plumage and the delicacy of their flesh and not for the sake of their song which consists in an unmeaning cluck or in a shrill cry resembling that of the Jay which they utter when handled but to judge fairly of their warble we ought to hear them in the season of love when the warmth of passion inspires and softens the native strains We are ignorant also of the particulars of their breeding it is undoubtedly in the countries where they spend the summer but there are not many observers in the Lapland Alps  These birds do not perch they continue al∣ways on the ground where they run and trip about like our Larks to which they are similar also in their port in their size in their long spurs c but differ in the shape of the bill and tongue in their plumage in their migrations in their arctic abodes c  Some able naturalists have ranged the Snow Ortolan with the Larks but Linnaeus has with great propriety referred it to the Buntings    It is observed that they sleep little or none in the night and begin to hop by the earliest dawn Perhaps this is the reason why they prefer the lofty mountains of the north in summer where the day lasts the whole season  Total length six inches and a half the bill five lines on the palate is a small tubercle that distinguishes the genus the hindtoe is equal to that of the middle and the nail is much longer and less hooked the alar extent eleven inches and one fourth the tail two inches and twothirds somewhat forked consisting of twelve quills and projecting ten lines beyond the wings  Specific character of the Snow Bunting  Emberiza Nivalis  "Its wingquills are white the primaries black without the tailquills black the three lateral white"  These birds are of the size of the Chaffinch They probably breed in Spitzbergen and certainly in Greenland where they make their nests in the fissures of the mountain rocks employing grass for the outside feathers for the inside and the down of the arctic fox for lining They lay five white eggs spotted with brown They sing sweetly sitting on the ground  In autumn the Snow Buntings issue from their frozen retreats and visit the northern parts of Europe They appear in Sweden in severe weather and are thence called  Illvarsvogel  and  Hardvarsfogel  and many are caught near the seashores They enter Britain by the north of Scotland at first they are lean but soon grow fat and delicious the Highlands abound with them  The Snow Buntings appear also at Hudson'sbay in April retire northward in May to breed and pay another visit in September They live in vast flocks feed on grassseeds c and are easily caught  Their colour being produced by the degree of cold to which they are exposed is necessarily variable  VARIETIES of the SNOW BUNTING  It will be readily perceived from what we have said in regard to the winter and summer dress of these birds that we are not here to consider the Varieties which belong to the two principal epochs or the intermediate terms these being only the shades which mark the progressive influence of cold or heat  I The JACOBINE BUNTING  This is the  Black Bunting  of Pennant and Latham and the  Snow Bird  of Catesby and Kalm it is the  Emberiza Hyemalis  in the Linnaean system and the  Hortulanus Nivalis Niger  of Brisson Specific character  "It is black its belly white"  These birds breed in the northern parts of America winter in the state of New York and in very severe seasons visit Virginia and the Carolinas in immense bodies They frequent the gardens and hillocks to pick up the scattered grassseeds The Americans call them  Chuckbirds  and esteem them delicious eating  It is a variety of climate Its bill breast and belly are white the legs gray and all the rest black It appears every winter in Carolina and Virginia and retires in the summer to breed probably in the north  II The COLLARED SNOW BUNTING  This is the  Pied Chaffinch  of Albin and Latham the fourth variety of Linnaeus's  Snow Bunting  the  Fringilla Capite Albo  of Klein and the  Hortulanus Nivalis Torquatus  of Brisson  The head throat and neck are white It has two sorts of collars at the underpart of the neck the upper leadcolour the lower blue both se∣parated by the ground colour which forms a sort of white intermediate collar the quills of the wings are white tinctured with a greenish yel∣low and strewed with some black feathers the eight quills of the middle of the tail and the two outer ones white the two others black all the rest of the plumage reddish brown spotted with greenish yellow the bill red edged with cine∣reous the iris white and the legs fleshcolour∣edThis bird was caught in the county of Es∣sex it could not be ensnared till after many and tedious trials  Kramer observes that in the Ortolans as well as in the Yellow Buntings the Chaffinches and Bulfinches the two mandibles are moveable and this is the reason he says why they shell the seeds and do not swallow them entire  The RICE BUNTING  L'Agripenne  ou  L'Ortolan de Riz  Buff  Emberiza Oryzivora  Linn and Gmel  Hortulanus Carolinensis  Briss  Emberiza Carolinensis  Klein  The Rice Bird  Catesby  THESE birds are migratory birds and the motive of their passage is not known Numerous flocks of them are seen or rather heard in the month of September coming from the Island of Cuba where the rice has already at∣tained maturity and directing their course to Ca∣rolina where it is only coming into ear These remain in Carolina only three weeks and then advance towards the north always in search of more tender grain and by successive stations they penetrate as far as Canada and perhaps beyond But what is the most singular though there are other similar instances these flocks are composed entirely of females It is ascertained we are told from numerous diffections that only the females pass in September but in the beginning of the spring the males and females are intermingled and indeed this is the season of the union of the sexes  The plumage of the females is rusty over al∣most its whole body that of the males is more  diversified the forepart of the head and neck the throat the breast and all the underpart of the body the upperpart of the back and the thighs black with a mixture of rusty the back of the head and neck rusty the lowerpart of the back and rump of an olive cinereous the great superior coverts of the wings of the same colour edged with whitish the small superior coverts of the wings and the superior coverts of the tail dirty white the quills of the wing black tipt with brown and edged the great ones with sulphurcolour and the small ones with gray the quills of the tail are nearly like the great quills of the wings only all terminate in points  For this reason we have called the bird  Agripenne  lastly the bill is cinereous and the legs brown This Ortolan is remarked to be taller than the rest  Total length six inches and threefourths the bill six lines and a half the alar extent four inches the tail two inches and a half somewhat forked and exceeding the wings by ten lines  Specific character of the Rice Bunting  Emberiza Ory∣zivora  "Black the neck tawny the belly black the tailquills pointed"  It is remarkable that the Rice birds were not known in Carolina before the end of last century when that nutritious grain was introduced from Madagascar We may suppose that a few stray birds had been driven into that province by adverse winds and had fared so well among the ricecrops as to have re∣turned with their brood the ensuing season and thus in the course of a few years a direction would be given to their general mi∣grations They arrive in Carolina about September at first they are very lean but soon grow excessively fat and fly with difficulty so that they are easily shot Their stay lasts three weeks and both sexes make a transient visit in the spring A few remain through the winter in Carolina and even in Virginia where they subsist on the scattered grains of Indian corn  VARIETIES of the RICE BUNTING  The LOUISIANA BUNTING  L'Agrippenne  ou  Ortolan de la Louisiane  Buff  Emberiza Oryzivora  Var Linn  I consider this as a variety of the preceding produced by the influence of climate its size its port its shape are the same and the quills of the tail are likewise pointed the only difference in short consisting of the colours of the plumage The Louisiana Bunting has the throat and all the underpart of the body of a light yellow which is still more dilute on the lowerbelly the upperpart of the head and of the body and the small superior coverts of the wings are of an olivebrown the rump and the superior coverts of the tail yellow finely striped with brown the quills of the tail blackish those of the middle edged with yellow the lateral ones with white the intermediate ones with the different shades that intervene between white and yellow the great superior coverts of the wings  are black edged with white the quills are the same except the middle ones which have more white  The measures are nearly the same as in the Rice Bunting  Mr Pennant thinks that this bird is the female of the com∣mon Rice Bunting    The YELLOW BUNTING  In Germany it is called  Emmerling Geelammer Gerstammer Gruenzling Gaelgensicken Gilbling Gilberschen Gilwertsch Kornvogel Geelgorst  which names allude in general to its yellow plumage and its feeding upon corn especially barley in Switz∣erland  Emmeritz Embritz Emmering Hemmerling  in Italy  Zivolo Zigolo Cia Megliarina Vetzero Paietzero Spaiarda  in Brabant  Jasine  in Illyria  Struad  in Sweden  Groening  in Den∣mark  Gulspury Gulvesling  in Smoland  Golspinck  In Latin it was termed  Galgulus  or  Galbula  and also  Icterus  from the Greek  signifying the jaundice both on account of its yel∣low plumage and a notion entertained by the people that the sight of it cured that disease PLIN xxx    Le Bruant de France  Buff  Emberiza Citrinella  Linn Gmel Scop Will Kram c  Emberiza Flava  Gesner  Emberiza  Briss  The Yellow Youlring  Sibbaldi Scotia Illustrata  The Yellow Hammer  Ray  THE osseous tubercle or barleycorn on the palate of this bird proves indisputably its affinity to the Ortolans but it resembles them also by other properties by the shape of its bill and tail by its proportions and by the delicacy of its flesh  Its flesh is yellow and has been said to be a remedy for the jaundice nay a person afflicted by that disease might transfer it by looking at the bird  SCHWENCKFELD  Salerne remarks that its cry is nearly the same  The Yellow Bunting makes several hatches the last in September it places its nest on the  THE YELLOW HAMMER  ground below a clod in a bush or in a tuft of grass but always carelessly Sometimes it builds in the low branches of shrubs and is then at more pains The body of the nest consists of straws moss and dry leaves and is lined with roots the finest straws hair and wool The eggs are generally four or five spotted with brown of different shade on a white ground but the spots are thicker at the large end The female covers with such ardent attachment that often she can be caught by the hand in broad day The young are fed with small seeds in∣sects and even Mayflies but of these last the hard crust sheathing the wings is previously se∣parated by the parents They are however granivorous and fondest of millet and hemp∣seed They can be caught by a noose baited with a head of oats but cannot be decoyed it is said by the call In summer they haunt the trees the sides of the hedges and bushes some∣times they visit the vineyards but scarcely ever penetrate into the heart of the forests In win∣ter a part of them migrate into other climates and those which remain behind assemble and join the Chaffinches Sparrows c forming very numerous flocks especially in rainy weather They resort to the farms and even to the villages and high roads picking up their subsistence among the bushes and even in horsedung c and in that season they are almost as familiar  as the Sparrows  Frisch derives the German name  Ammer  or  Hammer  from  ham  which signifies a house  Ammer  on this hypothesis would denote  domestic  The old English name  Yellow Hammer  is evi∣dently borrowed from the German  They fly rapidly and alight suddenly and for the most part in the midst of the thickest foliage and never upon a separate branch Their ordinary cry consists of seven notes six of which are equal and of the same tone and the last sharper and prolonged  tĭ tĭ tĭ tĭ tĭ tĭ tī  According to some they have another cry  vignerot vignerot vignerot titchye  Olina says that they partly imitate the warble of the Chaffinches with which they associate Frisch relates that they adopt something of the song of the Canary when they hear it young he adds that the cross breed of the cock Bunting and hen Canary chants better than the father Lastly Guys says that the song of the cock Bunting grows pleasant on the approach of the month of August Aldrovandus also speaks of its fine warble    The Yellow Buntings are spread over the whole of Europe from Sweden to Italy and through all the interjacent countries and they are consequently exposed to great difference of temperature which happens to most birds in any degree domestic  The male is distinguished by the bright yel∣low feathers on the head and on the lowerpart of the body but on the head this colour is va∣riegated with brown it is pure yellow on the sides of the head under the throat under the belly and on the inferior coverts of the  wings and it is mixed with light chesnut on all the rest of the lower part the neck and the small superior coverts of the wings are olive the middle and large coverts of the wings the back and even the four first quills of the wings are blackish the rest are brown and edged the two outer with white and the ten others with whitish gray lastly their superior coverts are light chesnut terminated with whitish gray The female has not so much yellow as the male and is more spotted on the neck the breast and the belly in both the edges of the lower man∣dible are received into the upper whose edges are scalloped near the point the tongue is di∣vided at the tip into slender threads and lastly the hind claw is the longest of all The bird weighs five or six gros the intestinal tube is seven inches and a half long vestiges of a  coecum  the  oesophagus  is two inches and a half long dilating near the gizzard which is mus∣cular the gall bladder very small I found in the  ovarium  of the females which I dissected eggs of unequal bulk  Total length six inches and one third the bill five lines the legs eight or nine lines the middle toe almost as long the alar extent nine inches and onefourth the tail two inches and threefourths consisting of twelve quills some∣what forked not only because the intermediate quills are shorter than the lateral ones but also because the six quills on each side turn naturally  outwards they extend twentyone lines beyond the wings  Specific character of the Yellow Bunting  EmberizaCitri∣nella  "Its tailquills are blackish the two outermost marked with a sharp white spot on the inside"  Thus described by Brisson  "Above variegated with tawnyblackish and whitegray below yellowish the breast variegated with dilute chesnut yellowish and olive the head yellowish varied with dusky spots a dusky bar behind the eyes the two outmost tailquills on both sides marked within with a white spot"  It is six inches and a half long very frequent in England It lays six eggs which are whitishpurple with blackish irregular spots and streaks  VARIETIES of the YELLOW BUNTING  The colours vary in different subjects and in different climates both their shades and distribu∣tion sometimes the yellow extends over all the head neck c In some the head is of a yellowish cinereous in others the neck is cinereous spot∣ted with black the belly the thighs and the legs are saffroncolour the tail brown edged with yellow c  The CIRL BUNTING  Le Zizi  ou  Bruant de Haie  i e The HedgeBunting  Buff  Emberiza Cirlus  Linn and Gmel  Emberiza Sepiaria  Briss  Cirlus  Aldrov  The Cirlus  or  Zivolo  Will  THIS is seen sometimes perched sometimes running on the ground and particularly in newly ploughed fields where it finds seeds small worms and other insects and accordingly it almost always has earth sticking to its bill It is easily ensnared and when caught with bird∣lime it oftenest remains attached or if it en∣tangles itself it loses most of its feathers in the struggle and is no longer able to fly It soon becomes reconciled to captivity but is not ab∣solutely insensible of its situation for during the first two or three months it has only its usual chirp which it repeats with frequency and trepidation when a person goes near its cage however by gentle treatment it at length re∣sumes its warble Its size and its habits are nearly the same with those of the Yellow Bunt∣ing and probably if we were better acquainted with these birds we should perceive that they belonged to the same species  The Cirl Buntings are not found in the northern countries and seem to be most frequent in those of the south however they are rare in several provinces of France They are often seen with the Chaffinches whose song they imi∣tate and with whom they form numerous flocks especially in rainy days They feed on the same substances as the other granivorous tribe and live about six years according to Olina but this must be understood of them in the domestic state for it is uncertain what effects fresh air and freedom of motion may have upon longevity  In the male the upperpart of the head is spotted with blackish upon an olivegreen ground there is a yellow spot on the sides di∣vided into two unequal parts by a black streak which passes over the eyes the throat is brown and also the top of the breast and a yellow collar lies between them the rest of the underpart of the body is yellow which grows more dilute as it spreads to the tail and is spotted with brown on the flanks the upperpart of the neck and back is variegated with rufous and blackish the rump oliverufous and the supe∣rior coverts are of a purer rufous the quills of the wings brown edged with olive except the near∣est to the back which are rufous and the two middle ones which are rustygray lastly the bill is cinercous and the legs brown  In the female there is less of the yellow the throat is not brown nor does any brown spot appear on the breast  Aldrovandus tells us that the plumage is sub∣ject to much diversity in this species the one which he figured had a dull green tinge on its breast and of those which I have observed I found one of which the upperpart of the neck was olive with scarcely any admixture  Total length six inches and onefourth the bill about six lines the alar extent nine inches and threefourths the tail near three inches composed of twelve quills and projecting about ten lines beyond the wings and forked as in the Yellow Bunting  Specific character of the CirlBunting  EmberizaCirlus  "It is brown its breast spotted its eyebrow yellow the two outermost quills of its tail marked with a white wedgeshaped spot"  The FOOLISH BUNTING  Le Bruant Fou  Buff  EmberizaCia  Linn Gmel Kram  Emberiza Pratensis  Briss and Gesner  Emberiza Barbata  Scop  Cirlus Stultus  Ray and Will  THE Italians have applied the epithet of  Foolish  to this bird on account of its incautious disposition being readily caught in every sort of snare but the want of circum∣spection is characteristic of the genus and the Foolish Bunting is inconsiderate only in a higher degree The name of  Meadow Bunting  is improper for the most observant birdcatchers and fowlers have unanimously assured me that they never saw it in the meadows  Like the Cirl Bunting the Foolish Bunting is not found in the northern countries nor does its name occur in the catalogues of the Swedish and Danish birds It prefers solitude and delights in mountainous abodes It is very common and well known in the hills round Nantua Hebert  This excellent observer has communicated or confirmed the principal facts of the history of the Buntings  often saw it on the ground and upon the chesnuttrees and the country people told him that its flesh was excellent meat Its song is very ordinary and resembles that of the Yellow Bunting and the Prussian birdcatchers  have remarked that when it is put into a volery among others of a different species it discovers a strong predilection for the Yellow Bunting Indeed its cry  Linnaeus says that in flying it chirps  zip zip  its size its figure are the same and it differs only by some of its habits  In the male all the upperpart is variegated with blackish and gray but this gray is purer on the head and rusty everywhere else except on some of the middle coverts of the wings where it becomes almost white The same rusty gray edges almost all the quills of the wings and of the tail whose ground colour is brown only the two exterior quills of the tail are edged and tipt with white the orbits are rusty white the sides of the head and of the neck are gray the throat is gray dotted with blackish and edged on each side and below by a line almost black which forms an irregular sort of square with the gray plate on the sides of the head all the un∣derpart of the body is fulvous more or less di∣lute but dotted or variegated with blackish on the throat the breast and the flanks the bill and legs are gray  Total length six inches and one fourth the bill five or six lines the alar extent nine or ten inches the tail two inches and one third a little forked consisting of twelve quills and exceeding the wings by sixteen lines  Specific character of the Foolish Bunting  EmberizaCia

Kornlaerka  Corn Lark in Norwegian  Knotter  The Italian name  Strilozzo  comes from  Strillare  to  cr  k  on account of its cry In Greek it was called  or  according to Belon    Le Proyer  Buff  Emberiza Miliaria  Linn Gmel Kram and Frisch  Emberiza Alba  Will and Klein  Cynchramus  Briss  THIS is a bird of passage and arrives early in the spring It deserves to be called  Meadow Bunting  since in the summer season it never strays far from the low grounds  Belon says that it follows the water like the Woodcock  It makes its nest among the fields of barley of oats of millet c seldom on the surface of the ground but three or four inches above among the thick strong herbage  Belon  The female lays four five and sometimes six eggs and while she is engaged in hatching the male brings her food and sitting on the summit of a tree he re∣peats incessantly the disagreeable cry  tri tri tri tiritz  which he retains only till the month of August the notes are sharper and shorter than those of the Yellow Bunting  It has been observed that when the Bunting rose from the ground towards a branch its legs dropped and its wings quivered with an irre∣gular  THE BUNTING  motion peculiar to the season of love At other times in autumn for instance it flies equably and swiftly and mounts to a consider∣able height  The young ones leave the nest long before they are able to fly and take delight to run among the grass and this would seem to be the reason why the parents build so close to the ground The pointerdogs often surprise them in the chace of quails The parents still continue to feed and guard them till they are fledged but their anxiety for the safety of their brood often betrays them and if a person chances to go near the spot they circle his head with a doleful air  After the family is raised they pour their nu∣merous flocks into the fields especially among the crops of oats beans and the late sorts of grain They migrate soon after the Swallows and it very seldom happens that any of them remain during the winter  Gesner    It is observed that the Bunting does not flut∣ter from branch to branch but alights on the extremity of the highest and most detached bough either of a tree or shrub and in a mo∣ment begins its song which it prolongs for whole hours in the same place repeating its tiresome note  tri tri  and lastly that in tak∣ing flight it chatters with its bill  Most of these facts were communicated by M Hebert    The female sings also after the young no longer occupy her attention but this is only when perched on a branch and about midday Her song is as bad as that of the male She is rather smaller but her plumage is nearly the same Both feed upon grain and small insects which they find in the fields and meadows  These birds are spread over all Europe or rather they visit the whole extent of it in their migrations Olina affirms that they are more numerous at Rome and in its vicinity than in other countries Birdcatchers keep them in a cage to use as calls in autumn and they not only entice the Foolish Buntings into the snare but many other small birds of different kinds They are for this purpose put in low cages without any bars or roosts  In the male the upperpart of the head and body is variegated with brown and rufous the throat and the orbits light rufous the breast and all the rest of the underpart of the body yellowishwhite spotted with brown on the breast and sides the superior coverts of the wings their quills and those of the tail are brown edged with rufous more or less dilute the bill and legs brown gray  In the female the rump is gray verging upon rufous without any spots the superior coverts of the tail the same colour edged with whitish and in general the quills of the tail and of the wings are bordered with lighter colours  The bill of these birds is of a remarkable shape the two mandibles are moveable as in the Ortolans the edges are also reentering as in the Common Bunting and the junction is made in a crooked line the edge of the lower man∣dible on each side near the third of its length makes an obtuse salient angle and is received by the corresponding  reentrant  angle in the uppermandible which is more solid and bulky than in most other birds the tongue is narrow thick and tapered to a point like a toothpick the nostrils are covered above by a membrane of a crescent shape and below by small feathers the first  phalanx  of the outer toe is joined to that of the middle toe  Intestinal tube thirteen inches and a half the gizzard muscular preceded by a moderate dilata∣tion of the  oesophagus  containing vegetable mat∣ter and nuts with small pebbles slight vestiges of a  coecum  no gallbladder the great axis of the testicles four lines the smaller one three lines Total length of

BRAZILIAN BUNTING  Le Guirnegat  Buff  Emberiza Brasiliensis  Gmel and Briss  HAD not this bird been a native of South America and its cry been different from that of the Yellow Bunting  Our Bunting is called  Luteola Aureola Goldhammer Bruant Jaune Bruant Doré Cia Pagliarina  so that yellow would seem to form part of its essence  I should have considered it as a mere variety Indeed its plu∣mage has even more of the Yellow than com∣mon in ours  Some individuals of our Bunting have the head the neck and the upperside of the body almost entirely yellow but this is rare  and I have no doubt but they would intermix and beget prolific offspring  The yellow is spread unmixed on the head the neck and all the underpart of the body and also borders almost all the superior coverts and the quills of the tail and of the wings which are brown on the back it is inter∣mingled with brown and green the bill and the eyes are black and the legs brown  This bird is found in Brazil and probably is indigenous for the natives have given it a name  Guiranheemgata  Marcgrave praises its song and compares it to that of the Chaffinch  The female is very different from the male for the same author tells us that the plumage and cry resemble those of the Sparrow  Specific character of the  Emberiza Brasiliensis  "Its top its neck and the underside of its body yellow its back its wings and its tail variegated with yellow and brown"  II The MEXICAN BUNTING  La Therese Jaune  Buff  Emberiza Mexicana  Gmel  As I have seen only the figure and a dead specimen of this bird I can give but an imper∣fect description Its plumage is much like that of the Common Yellow Bunting almost all the head the throat and the sides of the neck are orangeyellow the breast and the underpart of the body speckled with brown on a dirty white ground the back of the head and neck and all the upperpart of the body brown this last colour tapers to a point on each side of the neck and extends almost to the eye The quills of the wings and tail and their coverts are brown edged with a lighter brown  Specific character of the  Emberiza Mexicana  "Above it is rusty below partly white spotted with brown its head and throat yellow"  III The YELLOWFACED BUNTING  La Flaveole  Buff  Emberiza Flaveola  Linn and Gmel  The forehead and throat are yellow and all the rest of the plumage gray It is nearly of the size of the Siskin Linnaeus who has made us acquainted with this species informs us that it is a native of the warm countries but does not mention to what continent it belongs  Specific character of the  Emberiza Flaveola  "It is gray its face yellow"  IV The OLIVE BUNTING  L'Olive  Buff  Emberiza Olivacea  Linn and Gmel  Emberiza Dominicensis  Briss  This little Bunting which is found in Domi∣nica exceeds not the size of a Wren All the upperpart and even the tail and the quills of the wings are of an olivegreen the throat orangeyellow there is a spot of the same co∣lour between the bill and the eye the forepart of the neck is blackish all the underpart of the body a very light gray tinged with olive the anterior part of the wings edged with light yellow the bill and legs brown  The female has not the black neckpiece nor the orangeyellow spot between the bill and the eye nor is the throat orangeyellow as in the male  Total length three inches and threefourths the bill four lines and a half the alar extent six inches the tail eighteen lines consisting of twelve quills and projecting seven or eight lines beyond the wings  Specific character of the  Emberiza Olivacea  "It

Titmouse the upperpart of the head is fulvous the inferior coverts of the wings whitish the rest of the plumage brown  VI The PLATA BUNTING  L'Emberise à Cinq Couleurs  Buff  Emberiza Platensis  Gmel  This bird was brought from BuenosAyres We describe it on the authority of Commerson who speaks only of its plumage and external  characters and takes no notice of its manner of living nor informs us whether it has the dis∣criminating properties of the species  All the upperpart of the body is of a brown green verging to yellow the head and the upperpart of the tail of a darker tinge the underpart of the tail has more of a yellow cast the back marked with some black streaks the anterior edge of the wings bright yellow the quills of the wings and the outermost of those of the tail edged with yellowish the underpart of the body cinereous white the pupil blackish blue the iris chesnut the bill cinere∣ous convex and pointed the edges of the lower mandible  reentrant  the nostrils covered

coverts of the wings their quills and those  of the tail are brown edged with reddish gray more or less dilute the bill brown and the legs yellowish tinged slightly with reddish gray It is found in the Isle of Bourbon is nearly of the bulk of the Yellow Hammer but its tail is shorter and its wings longer the former pro∣jecting about ten lines beyond the latter  VIII The GRAY BUNTING  Le Gonambouch  Buff and Seba  Emberiza Grisea  Gmel  Emberiza Surinamensis  Briss  Seba tells us that this bird is very common at Surinam that it is of the size of the Lark and that it sings like the Nightingale and conse∣quently much better than any of the Buntings which is extraordinary in an American bird The people of the country say that it is ex∣tremely fond of maize and often perches upon the top of the stalk  Its principal colour is light gray but there is a tinge of red on the breast the tail the coverts and the quills of the wings the quills of the wings are white below  Total length five inches the bill five lines the tail eighteen lines and exceeding the wings by ten lines  IX The FAMILIAR BUNTING  Le Bruant Familier  Buff  Emberiza Familiaris  Linn and Gmel  Motacilla

Ca∣nadian bird the upperpart of the head is dull rufous the upperpart of the neck and of the body variegated with the same and with blue the rufous is not so deep on the small coverts of the wings nor on the large ones which are edged and tipt with that colour the quills of the wings and of the tail are brown edged with bluegray the bill and legs are browngray  Total length four inches and onefourth the bill five lines the alar extent seven inches and  onethird the tail an inch consisting of twelve quills and not exceeding the wings by more than four lines  XII The BONJOUR COMMANDER  This is the name which the settlers in Cayenne give to a kind of Bunting which frequents the dwellings and sings at daybreak Some call it the Cayenne Bunting It resembles the one from the Cape of Good Hope so exactly that Sonini thinks it is the same One of the ap∣pellations ought therefore to be rejected and this shews that all epithets of birds that are geo∣graphical are insufficient to discriminate them  The cry is shriller than that of our Sparrows they are generally on the ground and like the Buntings they are for the most part in pairs  The male has a black hood crossed by a gray bar the cheeks are cinereous there is a black ray extending from the base of the bill to the hood and below and behind it there is a rufous halfcollar the upperpart of the body is greenishbrown variegated on the back with oblong black spots the coverts of the wings are edged with rusty all the underpart of the body is cinercous  It is a little smaller than the Cirl Bunting its total length being only five inches its wings are short and scarcely reach to the middle of the tail  XIII The REDEYED BUNTING  Commerson described this bird on the Isle of France which it inhabits and where it is called  Calfat  The upperpart of the head is black and all the upperpart of the body including the wings and the tail are bluish cinereous the tail edged with black the throat black the breast and belly winecoloured a white bar stretches from the corner of the opening of the bill to the back of the head the orbit of the eyes is naked and rosecoloured the iris the bill and the legs also rosecoloured the inferior coverts of the tail white  It is of a middle size between the Sparrow and the Linnet  The BULFINCH  In German  Blutfinch Guegger Brommeiss Bollenbeisser Rotvogel Thumbherz

In Greek it was called  from  a fig on which it was supposed to feed and also  from  fire on account of its red plumage    Le Bouvreuil  Buff  LoxiaPyrrhula  Linn and Gmel  Coccothraustes Sanguinea  Klein  Rubicilla  seu  Pyrrhula  Aldrov Johnst c  Pyrrhula  Briss  Rubrica  Gesner  The Bulfinch Alp  or  Nope  Will  NATURE has been liberal to this bird for she has bestowed upon it a beautiful plu∣mage and a fine voice The colours are perfect after the first moulting but the song needs to be assisted and formed by art In the state of freedom the Bulfinch has three cries which are all unpleasant the first which is the most common is a sort of whoop it begins with one then two in succession and afterwards three and four c and when animated it seems to articulate with force the repeated syllable  tui tui tui  the second is an air of greater extent but lower almost hoarse  THE BULFINCH  and running into a discord  This is its warble  sĭ ŭt ŭt ŭt ŭt sĭ rĕ ŭt ŭt ŭt īt ŭt ŭt sĭ rĕ ŭt  With the same voice it also pronounced  ut la ut mi ut la  Sometimes these passages were preceded by a drawling tone in the same style but without any inflexion and which resembled a sort of mewing The notes of the French gamut are Sol La Si Ut Re Mi Fa corresponding to the English C D E F G A B  and the third is a feeble stifled cry which it vents at intervals exceedingly shrill and broken but at the same time so soft and delicate that it scarcely can be heard it emits this sound much in the same way as a ventriloquist without any apparent motion of the bill or throat only with a sensible action of the abdominal musclesSuch is the song of the Bulfinch when left to the education of its parents but if man deigns to instruct it me∣thodically  It is said that to succeed in teaching the Bulfinches one should whistle to them not with the Canaryflageolet but with the lipped or Germanflute whose tone is deeper and fuller The Bulfinch can also mimic the warble of other birds  and accustom it to finer mellower and more lengthened strains it will listen with attention and the docile bird whether male or female  The hen Bulfinch is the only female it is said of the sing∣ingbirds that learns to whistle as well as the male  Aedonologie  p OlinaAldrovandus c  Some pretend that her voice is weaker and sweeter than that of the cock Bulfinch  without relinquishing its native airs will imitate exactly and sometimes surpass its master  "I know a curious person says the author of the  Aedonologie  p who having whistled some airs quite plain to a Bulfinch was agreeably surprized to see the bird add such graceful turns that the master could hardly recognize his own music and acknow∣ledged that the scholar excelled him"  However it must be con∣fessed that if the Bulfinch be illdirected it acquires harsh strains Hebert saw one which never had heard any person whistle but carters and which whistled like them with the same strength and coarseness  It also learns easily to articulate words  and phrases and utters them with so tender an accent that we might almost suppose it felt their forceThe Bulfinch is besides susceptible of personal attachment which is often strong and durable Some have been known after escaping from the volery and living a whole year in the woods to recognize the voice of the mistress and return to forsake her no more  One of these birds which returned to its mistress after living a year in the woods had all its feathers ruffled and tangled Liberty has its inconveniences especially for an animal depraved by domestication  Others have died of melancholy on being removed from the first object of their attachment  Aedonologie p  These birds well remember injuries received a Bulfinch which had been thrown to the ground in its cage by some of the rabble though it did not appear much af∣fected at the time fell into convulsions ever after at the sight of any mean looking fellow and expired in one of these fits eight months from the date of its first accident  The Bulfinches spend the summer in the woods or on the mountains they make their nest in the bushes five or six feet from the ground and sometimes lower this consists of moss lined with soft materials and its opening is said to be the least exposed to the prevailing wind The female lays from four to six eggs  of a dirty white and a little bluish encircled near the large end with a zone formed by spots of two colours some of an illdefined violet others of a distinct black She disgorges the food for the young like the Goldfinches the Linnets c The male is attentive to his mate and Linnaeus relates that he sometimes holds out to her a spider in his bill a very long time The young ones begin not to whistle till they are able to eat without assistance and then they seem instinctively benevolent if what is related be true that in a hatch of four the three elder will feed their puny brother After the breeding is over the parents still continue associated through the winter for they are al∣ways seen in pairs those which remain in the country leave the forests and descend from the mountains  There are many Bulfinches in the mountains of Bologna of Modena of Savoy of Dauphiné of Provence c OLINA  when the snow falls and for∣sake the vineyard which they haunt in the au∣tumn and approach our dwellings or lodge among the hedges by the roadsides those which migrate depart with the Woodcocks about All Saints day and return in the month of April  Many are seen about the end of autumn and the beginning of winter in the mountainous parts of Silesia but not every year according to Schwenckfeld  They feed in summer upon all sorts of seeds insects and sorbs  Linnaeus  and in the winter upon  juniperberries upon the buds of aspen of alder of oak of fruittrees of the marshwillow c whence the name  Ebourgeonneux  from  Bourgeon  which they sometimes have in France in that forbidding season they are heard to whistle and their song though somewhat sad cheers the torpid gloom of nature  In the cage they eat hempseed biscuit prunes sallad c Olina recommends for the young ones the Nightingale's paste made with walnuts c    Some reckon these birds attentive and thought∣ful and their heavy air and the facility with which they are instructed seem to favour that idea but on the other hand their allowing one to get near them and their being decoyed into the different snares  Gesner caught many of them during the winter by a bait of nightshade berries  indicate want of cir∣cumspection As their skin is very tender those which are caught with birdlime lose in strug∣gling to escape part of their down and even of their quills unless a person speedily disentan∣gles them It deserves to be remarked that those which have the finest plumage are the least capable of instruction being older and not so tractable but even the old ones are soon recon∣ciled to the cage provided that at first they have plenty of food they can also be properly tamed as I have already noticed though to succeed re∣quires time and patient attention which is the reason that persons sometimes fail in the attempt It seldom happens that one is caught alone the  other is soon enticed to follow its compa∣nion and sacrisices its freedom to the calls of friendship  It has been afferted that the Canary which breeds with so many other species will never submit to the embrace of the Bulfinch and it is alleged as the reason that the cock Bul∣finch when in heat holds his bill open which frightens the Canary But the Marquis de Piolenc assures me that he saw a Bulfinch pair with a hen Canary which had five young ones about the beginning of April their bill was larger than that of Canaries of the same age and they began to be covered with a blackish down which seemed to shew that they had more of the father than the mother unfortu∣nately they all died in performing a short jour∣ney What adds more weight to this observa∣tion Frisch gives directions for the experiment he advises that the cock Bulfinch be the smallest of its kind and be kept long in the same volery with the hen Canary he subjoins that some∣times a whole year elapses before the female will allow the Bulfinch to come near or to eat out of the same tray which shews that the union is difficult but not impossible  It has been observed that the Bulfinches jerk their tail briskly upwards and downwards though not in so remarkable a degree as the Wagtails They live five or six years their flesh is palat∣able according to some and not fit to be caten  according to others by reason of its bitterness this must depend upon the age season and food They are of the size of the HouseSparrow and weigh about one ounce The upperpart of the head the ring round the bill and the origin of the neck are fine glossy black which extends more or less forwards and backwards  Hence the name of Monk or Pope which this bird has in many languages and that of  Coallyhood  given to it by the people in Scotland T  the forepart of the neck the breast and the top of the belly beautiful red the abdomen and the inferior coverts of the tail and wings white the upperpart of the neck the back and the shoulders cinereous the rump white the superior coverts and the quills of the tail fine black verging to violet a whitish spot on the outermost quills the quills of the wings blackish cinereous and deeper the nearer to the body the last of all red on the outside the great coverts of the wings of a fine changing black terminated with reddish lightgray the middle ones cinereous the small ones blackish ashcolour edged with reddish the iris hazel the bill blackish and the legs brown  The sides of the head and the forepart of the neck the breast the top of the belly and in a word almost all that was red in the male is vinous ashcolour in the female and some∣times even the abdomen nor has it the fine glossy changing black that occurs on the head  and other parts of the male I have seen a fe∣male however which had the last of the wingquills edged with red and which had no white on the outermost of those of the tail Linnaeus adds that the tip of the tongue is divided into small filaments but I have always found it quite entire in the male and shaped like a very short toothpick  In many young Bulfinches which I have observed about the end of June the forehead was light rufous the forepart of the neck and breast rustybrown the belly and the inferior coverts of the tail fulvous which extends and grows more dilute on the side the underpart of the body more or less

tells that the Bulfinches may be di∣vided into three different sizes the Marquis de Piolenc was acquainted with two distinguished by their bulk  The smallest adds M de Piolenc is of the size of the Chaf∣finch its body is longer its breast of a brighter red and it seems wilder than the ordinary Bulfinch  and others pretend that those of Nivernois are smaller than those of Picardy Lottinger assures us that the Bulfinch of the mountains exceeds that of the plain and this  accounts for the diversity of bulk being vari∣ously modified by local situation But these are too numerous to be separately treated and I shall here take notice only of the varieties of plumage  I The WHITE BULFINCH  LoxiaPyrrhula  var Linn  Schwenck∣feld speaks of a White Bulfinch that was caught near the village of Frischbach in Silesia and which had only some black feathers on the back This fact is confirmed by Delisle  "There are in this canton of Beresow in Siberia says that excellent astronomer White Bulfinches whose back is somewhat blackish and gray in summer these birds have a delicate pleasant song much superior to that of European Bulfinches"  It is probable that the northern climate has much contributed to this change of plumage  II The BLACK BULFINCH  LoxinPyrrhula  var Linn  Under this denomination I include not only those which are entirely or almost black but also those which have perceptibly begun to assume that com∣plexionsuch was what I saw at Baron Goula's its throat and rump were black the inferior coverts of its tail its lower belly and the top of its breast variegated with rufous winecolour and black and no white spots ap∣peared  upon the last quill of the tail Those mentioned by Anderson and Salerne were en∣tirely of a jet black that of Reaumur noticed by Brisson was black over the whole body I have observed one which assumed a fine glossy black after the first moulting but which still re∣tained a little red on each side of the neck and a little gray behind the neck and on the small superior coverts of the wings its legs were fleshcoloured and the inside of its bill red that of Albin had some red feathers under the belly the five first quills of the wing edged with white the iris white and the legs fleshcoloured  Mr White in his Natural History of Selburne relates also an instance of a cock Bulfinch turning dingy and afterwards black  Albin remarks that this bird was ex∣ceedingly gentle like all the Bulfinches It often happens that this robe of black disappears in moulting and gives place to the natural colours but often it renews each time and re∣mains for several yearssuch was the case with Reaumur's This would imply that the change of colour is not the effect of disease  III The GREAT BLACK AFRICAN BUL∣FINCH  Loxia Panicivora  Linn and Gmel  Pyrrhula Africana Nigra  Briss  The Whitewinged Grosbeak  Lath  Though this bird is a native of a distant country and exceeds the size of the European Bulfinch I am still inclined to regard  it as analogous to the variety which I have de∣scribed by the name of the Black Bulfinch and to suspect that the burning climate of Africa communicates a black hue to the plumage as the cold of Siberia introduces a snowy white It is entirely black except a very small white spot on the great coverts of the wing and also the bill is gray and the legs ashcoloured It was brought alive to Paris from the coasts of Africa  Total length seven inches and onefourth the bill six lines the alar extent four inches and onefourth the tail two inches and a half con∣sisting of twelve quills and exceeding the wings eighteen lines  Specific character of the Bulfinch  LoxiaPyrrbula  "Its joints are black the coverts of the tail and of the hind quills of its wing white"  Thus described by Brisson  "Above ci∣nereous below red  Male  winecinereous  Female  the top of its head of a shining black its rump and lowerbelly white its tailquills violetblack the lateral ones blackishcinereous within the outermost on both sides marked interiorly with a whitish spot"  In England the Bulfinch breeds in the end of May or the beginning of June it is pernicious to our gardens  FOREIGN BIRDS WHICH ARE RELATED TO THE BULFINCH  I The ORANGE GROSBEAK  Lath  Le Bouveret  Buff  Loxia Aurantia  Gmel  I CLASS together two birds the one from the Isle of Bourbon and the other from the Cape of Good Hope they resemble each other so closely that they must belong to the same species and there is besides an intercourse be∣tween these two places  Black and bright orange are the prevailing colours in this bird  fig  which I conceive to be the male the orange is spread on the throat the neck and on all the body without excep∣tion black occupies the head the tail and the wings but the wingquills are bordered with orange and some of them tipt with white  In the female all the head the throat and the forepart of the neck are covered with a  sort of black cowl the underpart of the body is white the upperpart orange not so bright as in the male but spreads diluting on the quills of the tail the quills of the wings are deli∣cately edged with lightgray almost white in both the bill and legs are reddish  Total length about four inches and a half the bill somewhat less than four lines the alar ex∣tent near seven inches the tail twenty lines consisting of twelve quills it exceeds the wings about fifteen lines  Specific character of the  Loxia Aurantia  "It is fulvous its cap wings and tail black"  II The WHITEBILLED GROSBEAK  Lath  Le Bouvreuil à Bec Blanc  Buff  Loxia Torrida  Gmel  This is the only bird of Guiana that Sonini admits to be a true Bulfinch Its bill in the dried specimen is horncolour but we are as∣sured that it is white in the living subject the throat the forepart of the neck and all the upperpart of the body not excepting the wings and the tail are black on the wings is a small white spot which often lies concealed  under the great coverts the breast and belly are deep chesnut  This bird is of the size of our Bulfinch its total length four inches and threefourths and its tail exceeds the wings by almost its whole length  Specific character of the  Loxia Torrida  "It is black its breast and belly chesnut"  III The LINEATED GROSBEAK  Lath  Le Bouveron  Contracted for  BouvreuilBecrond  BulfinchRoundbill  Buff  Loxia Lincola  Linn and Gmel  Pyrrhula Africana Nigra minor  Briss  This bird seems to form the shade between the European Bulfinches and the Roundbills of America It is not larger than the Twite a fine black changing into green is spread over the head the throat and all the upperpart of the body including the coverts and quills of the tail and of the wings or more properly speak∣ing on what appears of these for the inside is either not black or is black of a different kind there is also a very small white spot on each wing and three spots of the same colour but larger the one on the top of the head and the  two other below the eyes All the underpart of the body is white the feathers of the belly and the inferior coverts of the tail are frizzled in some subjects for we may reckon the Frizzled Bulfinch of Brazil as belonging to this species since the sole difference consists in the contexture of the plumage which is superficial and fluc∣tuating It is probable that Frizzled Bulfinches are cockbirds Nature seeming in general to distinguish the males by strength and beauty But how it would be asked is the male found in Brazil and the female in Africa I answer That the native climate of birds that pass through different hands is very uncertain If these were brought alive to Paris they might also have been carried from South America to Africa Any person who will draw the comparison between these two birds will readily admit one of the two suppositions rather than refer them to two different species  Total length four inches and onethird the bill four lines the alar extent seven inches and a half the tail twentyone lines consisting of twelve quills and exceeding the wings about an inch  Specific character of the  Loxia Lincola  "It is black the frontel line and temples white"  IV The MINUTE GROSBEAK  Lath  Le BecRond à Ventre Roux  Buff  Loxia Minuta  Linn and Gmel  The Gray Loxia  Bancr Guian  America produces also Roundbills which though analogous to the Bulfinches are still so different as to merit a distinct denomination  The present continues the whole year paired with its female It is lively and tame living near dwellings and haunting grounds which have been under cultivation but lately aban∣doned It feeds upon grain and fruits and hopping about it emits a cry much like that of the Sparrow but shriller It forms with a cer∣tain reddish herb a small round nest of about two inches diameter within and places it in the same shrub that furnishes its subsistence The female lays three or four eggs  The upperpart of the head the neck and the back are browngray the coverts of the wings their quills and those of the tail are of the same colour nearly and bordered with white or light chesnut the throat the forepart of the neck the underpart of the body the inferior coverts of the tail and the rump deep chesnut the bill and legs brown  In some subjects the throat is of the same brown gray as the upperpart of the head  Specific character of the  Loxia Minuta  "It is gray its rump and the underside of its body ferruginous the four five or six wingquills white on both sides at their base its tail en∣tire"  V The BLUE GROSBEAK  Le BecRond  ou  BouvreuilBleu d'Amerique  Buff  Loxia Coerulea  Linn and Gmel  Pyrrhula Carolinensis Coerulea  Briss and Klein  Brisson mentions two American blue Bul∣finches of which he makes two separate species but as they are both natives of the same climate are of the same size of the same shape nearly and except the wings tail and bill are of the same blue colour I shall consider them as form∣ing one single species and regard the differences as resulting from the influence of climate  In both of them the prevailing colour is deep blue The one from South America has a small black spot between the bill and the eye the quills of the tail those of the wings and the great coverts of these are edged with blue the bill is blackish and the legs gray  That of North America has at the base of its bill a black circular zone which extending forms a junction between the eyes the quills of the tail and those of the wings and their great coverts brown tinged with green their middle coverts red forming a transverse bar of the same colour the bill brown and the legs black The plumage of the female is uniform and of a deep brown intermixed with a little blue  With respect to the habits and oeconomy of these birds we can make no comparison since  we are unacquainted with those of the first Catesby informs us in regard to the one from Carolina that it is very solitary and rare that it continues paired with its female and never appears in flocks that it never winters in Caro∣lina that its song is monotonous and consists of a repetition of the same note In all these proper∣ties the analogy to our Bulfinch is marked  Specific character of the  Loxia Coerulea  "It is coerulean its wings dusky with a purple bar at the base"  VI The BLACK GROSBEAK  Le Bouvreuil  ou  BecRond Noire Blanc  Buff  Loxia Nigra  Linn Gmel and Klein  Pyrrhula Mexicana Nigra  Briss  The Little Black Bulfinch  Cates Alb and Bancr  As we have neither seen this bird nor the dried specimen we cannot decide whether it is a Bulfinch or a Roundbill It has a little white on the anterior edge and on the base of the two first quills of the wing all the rest of the plu∣mage is quite black and even the bill and the legs the upper mandible has a considerable scalloping on each side  This bird is a native of Mexico It is nearly of the size of the Canary Finch total length five inches and one fourth the bill five lines the tail two inches and exceeding the wings one inch  Specific character of the  Loxia Nigra  "It is black with a white spot on the shoulder and at the base of the two exterior wingquills"  VII The PURPLE FINCH  Le Bouvreuil  ou  BecRond Violet de la Caroline  Buff  Fringilla Purpurea  Gmel  Pyrrhula Carolinensis Purpurea  Briss  This bird is entirely of a dull violet except the belly which is white the superior coverts of the wings where the violet is slightly mixed with brown and the quills of the tail and of the wings which are parted by blue and brown the former in the direction of their breadth and the latter in that of their length  The female is uniformly brown only its breast is spotted as in the Redpoll  These birds appear in the end of November and retire before the winter in small bodies They live upon juniperberries and like our Bulfinches destroy the buds of the fruittrees They are nearly of the size of the Chaffinch  Total length five inches and twothirds the bill five lines the tail two inches somewhat forked consisting of twelve quills and project∣ing seven or eight lines beyond the wings  Specific character of the  Fringilla Purpurea  "It is olive its belly whitish its wingquills dusky within"  It appears in Carolina in November and feeds upon juniperberries  VIII The PURPLE GROSBEAK  Le Bouvreuil  ou  BecRond Violet à Gorge Sourcils Rouge  Buff  Loxia Violacea  Linn and Gmel  Pyrrhula Bahamensis Violacea  Briss  Coccothraustes Purpurea  Klein  Passer Niger Punctis Croceis  Ray and Sloane  This has still more of the violet than the pre∣ceding for the quills of the wings and tail are also of that colour but it is principally distin∣guished by its red throat and its beautiful red eyebrows painted on the violet ground the inferior coverts of its tail are also red and its bill and legs are gray  The female has the same red spots as the male but the ground colour of its plumage is brown  These birds are found in the Bahama Islands They are nearly as large as a Housesparrow  Total length five inches and twothirds the bill five or six lines the tail two inches and a half and projects thirteen or fourteen lines be∣yond the wings  Specific character of the  Loxia Violacea  "It is violet its eyebrows its throat and its vent white"  It inhabits the Bahama Islands and feeds upon the berries of the  Amyris Toxifera  a tree from whose trunk a black poisonous juice exudes  IX The BLACKCRESTED GROSBEAK  La Huppe Noire  Buff  Loxia Coronata  Gmel  Pyrrhula Americana Cristata  Briss  The plumage of this bird is painted with the richest colours the head black bearing a crest of the same the bill white all the upperpart of the body brilliant red the underpart fine blue there is a black spot before the neck This justifies the assertion of Seba that it is in∣ferior in beauty to none of the singing birds We may thence infer that it has some sort of warble It is found in America  Brisson reckons it much larger than our Bul∣finch The measures were taken from a figure whose accuracy is not well ascertainedTotal length six inches the tail eighteen lines and more and projecting about six lines beyond the wings  Specific character of the  Loxia Coronata  "It is scarlet below coerulean the crest on its head and the middle spot on its throat black"  The HAMBURGH  L'Hambouvreux  Buff  Pyrrhula Hamburgensis  Briss  Though this pretended Bulfinch is a native of Europe I place it after those of Africa and Ame∣rica because its habits are dissimilar It creeps upwards and downwards along the branches of trees like the Titmice feeds upon hornbeetles and other insects and has a tapered tail  The upperpart of its head and neck is reddish brown tinged with purple its throat brown it has a broad collar likewise brown upon a white ground the breast is yellowish brown sprinkled with black longish spots the belly and the in∣ferior coverts of the tail white the back the shoulders and all the upperpart of the body like the breast there are two white spots upon each wing the quills of the wings are light brown and yellowish those of the tail obscure brown above but white below the iris yellow and the bill black  It is rather larger than the HousesparrowIt is found near the city of Hamburgh  Total length five inches and threefourths the bill six lines the tail twentyone lines somewhat tapered and extends almost its whole length beyond the wings  THE COLY  The COLY  Le Coliou  Buff  IT appears to us that this bird should be ranged between the genus of the Widow and of the Bulfinch Like the former it has two long feathers in the middle of its tail and the latter it resem∣bles by the form of its bill which would be ex∣actly that of the Bulfinch were the lower man∣dible convex as the upper But the tail of the Coly differs from that of the Widow because it consists of tapered feathers of which the two last project only three or four inches beyond the rest whereas the Widowbird besides the true tail which is a bundle of feathers of equal lengths attached to the rump has appendices that in the different species of this genus con∣tains two four and even six or eight feathers extending to double or triple the length of the true tail In the Widowbirds too the webs of the projecting feathers are equal on both sides and pretty long and taper imperceptibly from the origin to the extremity except in the Domi∣nican and Shafttailed kinds the former hav∣ing its webs very short and quickly contracting towards the tips the latter also very short but which uniformly lengthen and expand at the tips In all the Colies the feathers of the tail whether those which properly belong to it or those which project from it have vanes that  continually diminish from the insertion to the termination Thus the real affinity between the tail of the Widowbirds and that of the Colies consists in its length and this analogy is the closest in the case of the Dominican Widow  M Mauduit has made two important obser∣vations on this subject The first is that the long tails the appendices and other ornaments of certain birds are not peculiar additions but only the greater extension of the parts common to all the feathered tribes Thus long tails con∣sist in the augmented growth of the quills of the tail and crests are derived from the enlargement of the feathers on the head The mustachoes of the Paradise bird appear to be only the produc∣tion of the slender narrow plumules which in all birds cover the  meatus auditorius externus  i e  The external aperture of the ear  The exuberant growth of the axillary feathers give rise to the long floating feathers which shoot from under the wings in the Common Paradise and of those which present the double wings in the King Paradise When these feathers lie flat they stretch towards the tail but when they are displayed they make angles with the axis of the body They differ from all other feathers as their webs are equal on both sides of the shaft They resemble oars and may serve to direct the bird's motion And thus all the ornaments of plumage are derived from the mere exuberance or production of parts usually less apparent  The second observation of M Mauduit is that these decorations are rare in the cold and tempe∣rate climates in both hemispheres but are pretty frequent in the hot countries especially in the old continent Scarce any longtailed birds are found in Europe except the Pheasant the Cock which also is often crested and has long floating feathers on the sides the Magpie and the long∣tailed Titmouse and we have hardly any crest∣ed birds but the Eared Owls the Lapwing the Crested Lark and the Crested Titmouse Some waterbirds indeed such as the Ducks and He∣rons have frequently long tails or ornaments composed of plumes tufts and feathers floating on the rumpThese are all the birds which the frigid and temperate zones afford decorated with luxuriance of plumage But in the torrid regions especially those of the old continent the greatest number of birds are robed with such rich attire we might instance the Colies the Paradise birds the Kakatoes the Widows the Crowned Pigeons the Hoopoes the Peacocks which are all natives of the hot climates of Asia c  The Colies belong to the ancient continent and are found in the warm parts of Asia and Africa but never in America or Europe  We are but imperfectly acquainted with four  pecies or varieties of which we can here give  nly the descriptions for their habits and in∣  tincts are unknown    The Coly of the Cape of Good Hope  Colius Capensis  Gmel  Loxia Capensis  Linn  The Cape Coly  Lath  which we have described from a specimen in the king's cabinet We cannot decide whether it is a male or a female The body is entirely cinereous pure on the back and rump and mixed on the head the throat and neck have a light lilac tint which deepens on the breast the belly is dirty white the quills of the tail are cinereous but the two lateral ones on each side are edged exteriorly with white the two intermediate quills measure six inches and nine lines those on the sides diminish gradually in length the legs are gray and the nails blackish the bill is gray at its base and blackish at its extre∣mity The length of the bird including the long quills of the tail is ten inches and three lines so that the real size of the body exceeds not three inches and a halfIt is found at the Cape of Good Hope  Specific character  "The outmost wingquills white ex∣ternally the body cinereous below whitish"    The Crested Coly of Senegal  Colius Senegalensis  Gmel  The Senegal Coly  Lath  resembles the preceding and may be regarded as a variety of that species though it differs in point of size being two inches longer It has a sort of crest formed by projecting feathers on the head and  which is of the same complexion as the rest of the body there is a welldefined bar of fine skyblue behind the head at the origin of the neck the tail tapers from its base to its extre∣mity the bill is not entirely black the upper mandible is white from its base to twothirds of its length and its end is blackThese differ∣ences though considerable do not allow us to decide whether this bird be a different species or only a variety of the preceding  Specific character  "Mixed with pale gray and winecolour the tail bluish the head crested"  Another species or variety rather larger than the last is the  Radiated Coly  Colius Striatus  Gmel  The Radiated Coly  Lath  which we have seen in Mauduit's cabinet It is thirteen inches long including the long quills of the tail which are only eight inches and a half and ex∣ceed the wings by seven inches and a half the bill is nine lines black above and whitish below  It is called  Radiated Coly  because all the up∣perpart of the body is radiated first under the throat with brown bars on a rusty gray ground and under the belly with bars likewise brown on a rufous ground the upperpart of the body is not radiated is of a dirty gray variegated slightly with lilac which becomes more reddish on the rump and tail which is green and ex∣actly similar to that of the other Colies  Mauduit to whom we owe our knowledge of this bird thinks that it is a native of the countries near the Cape of Good Hope because it was brought from the Cape with several other birds that certainly belong to that part of Africa  Specific character  "Gray belly rufous painted with black transverse stripes tail green"    The Coly of the Island of Panay  Colius Panayensis  Gmel  The Panayan Coly  Lath  We shall extract the account of it from Sonnerat's Voyage to New Guinea  "It is of the size of the European Grosbeak the head the neck the back the wings and the tail are ashgray with a yellow tinge the breast is of the same colour crossed with blackish rays the lowerpart of the belly and the upperpart of the neck are rusty the wings extend a little beyond the origin of the tail which is extremely long consisting of twelve unequal quills the two first are very short the two following on each side are longer and thus in the successive pairs till the two last which exceed all the rest the fourth and fifth pairs differ little from each other in regard to length the bill is black the legs are pale flesh colour the feathers that co∣ver the head are narrow and pretty long and form a crest which the bird can raise or depress at pleasure"  Specific character  "Cinereous tinged with yellow be∣low rufous breast striped with black head crested"  FIG THE MANAKIN  FIG THE CRESTED MANAKIN  The MANAKINS  Piprae  Linn  THESE birds are small and handsome the largest are not equal in size to a Sparrow and the others are inferior to that of the Wren The general characters are these the bill is short strait and compressed on the sides near the tip the uppermandible is convex above and slightly scallopped on the edges rather longer than the lowermandible which is plain and straight  In all these birds the tail is short and square∣cut and the toes have the same disposition as the Cock of the Rock the Tody and the Calao viz the midtoe is closely connected to the outertoe by a membrane as far as the third joint and the innertoe as far as the first joint only But as much as in that circumstance they resemble the Cock of the Rock so much are they removed from the Cotingas yet some authors have ranged the Manakins with the Cotingas  Edwards  others have joined them with the Sparrows  Klein  with the Titmice  Linnaeus  with the Lin∣nets  Klein  with the Tanagres  Marcgrave Willughby Johnston Salerne c  and with the Wren  Gerini    other nomenclators are more culpable for deno∣minating them  Pipra  or for classing them to∣gether with the Cock of the Rock  Brisson  to which they bear no analogy except in this disposition of the toes and in the square shape of the tail for besides the total disproportion in size the Cock of the Rock being as large compared with the Manakins as the common hen contrasted with a Sparrow there are many other obvious charac∣ters which distinguish them their bill is much shorter in proportion they are generally not crested and in those which have a crest it is not double as in the Cock of the Rock but formed by single feathers somewhat longer than the rest We ought therefore to remove from the Manakins not only the Hornbills but the Cock of the Rock and reckon them an inde∣pendent genus  The natural habits common to them all were not known and the observations which have been made are still insufficient to admit an exact detail We shall only relate the remarks com∣municated to us by Sonini of Manoncour who saw many of these birds in their native climates They inhabit the immense forests in the warm parts of America and never emerge from their recesses to visit the cleared grounds or the vici∣nity of the plantations They fly with con∣siderable swiftness but always at a small height  and to short distances they never perch on the summits of trees but on the middle branches they feed upon small wild fruits and also eat insects They generally occur in small bodies of eight or ten of the same species and some∣times intermingled with other flocks of the same genus or even of a different genus such as the Cayenne Warblers c It is commonly in the morning that they are found thus assembled and then seem to be joyous and warble their delicate little notes the freshness of the air seems to inspire the song for they are silent during the burning heat of the day and disperse and retire to the shade of the thickest parts of the forest This habit is observed indeed in many kind of birds and even in those of the woods of France where they collect to sing in the morn∣ing and evening but the Manakins never assemble in the evening and continue together only from sunrise to nine or ten o'clock in the forenoon and remain separate during the rest of the day and the succeeding night In general they prefer a cool humid situation though they never frequent marshes or the margins of lakes  The name of the  Manakin  was bestowed on these birds by the Dutch settlers at Surinam We know six distinct species but we can only give the first the appellation which it has in its native region  The TIGE or GREAT MANAKIN  Le Tijé  ou  Grand Manakin  Buff  PipraPareola  Linn Gmel and Browsk  Manacus Cristatus Niger  Briss  Tijéguacu of Marcgrave  Will  The Bluebacked Manakin  Lath and Edw  First Species  This species has been well described by Marc∣grave It is the largest of all the Manakins its total length is four inches and a half and it is nearly of the bulk of a Sparrow the upperpart of its head is covered with fine red feathers longer than the rest and which the bird can erect at pleasure which gives it the appearance of being crested the back and the small superior coverts of the wings are of a beautiful blue the rest of the plumage is velvet black the iris is of a fine sapphire colour the bill is black and the legs are red  The Abbe Aubry Rector of St Louis has in his cabinet a bird by the name of  Tiseguacu of Cuba  which is perhaps a variety of the pre∣sent arising from the difference of age or sex the only distinction being that the large feathers on the upperpart of the head are of a diluter red and even somewhat yellowish The de∣signation given to it would seem to imply that  it is found in the Island of Cuba and perhaps in other parts of America but it is very rare at Cayenne and is a bird of short flight and therefore it could hardly pass from the continent to Cuba  The Green Manakin with a red crest is the young of this species several Manakins have been observed whose plumage was interspersed with blue feathers but the green is obscure These birds must be frequent in the warm cli∣mates of America for we often received them along with other birds  Specific character of the Bluebacked Manakin or  PipraPareola  "Its crest is bloodcolour its body black its back blue"  The NUTCRACKER  Le CasseNoisette  Buff  PipraManacus  Linn and Gmel  Manacus  Briss  The Blackcapped Manakin  Edw and Lath  Second Species  We apply this name because the cry of this bird is exactly like the noise made by the small instrument with which we crack nuts It has no other song or warble it is pretty common in Guiana especially in the skirts of the forests for like the other Manakins it shuns the sa∣vannas  and cleared grounds The Nutcrackers live in small flocks with the other Manakins but intermingle not with them they remain for the most part on the ground and rarely perch on the branches and then they uniformly prefer the low ones They seem to live more upon insects than fruits they are often found among the lines of ants which sting their feet and make them hop and utter their nutcrack∣ing cry which they repeat very often They are very lively and frisky they are seldom at rest though they only hop and cannot fly far  The plumage is black on the head the back the wings the tail and white on all the rest of the body the bill is black and the legs yel∣low  Specific character of the Blackcaped Manakin  PipraManacus  "Black below white spot on the neck and the wings white"  The RED MANAKIN  Le Manakin Rouge  Buff  PipraAureola  Linn and Gmel  Manacus Ruber  Briss  The Red and Black Manakin  Edw and Lath  Third Species  The male is of a fine vivid red on the head the neck the upperpart of the back and  the breast orange on the forehead the sides of the head and the throat black on the belly with some red and orange feathers on the same part black also on the rest of the upperpart of the body the wings and the tail all the quills of the wings except the first have near the mid∣dle and on the inside a white spot which forms a bar of the same colour when the wing is display∣ed the top of the wings is of a very deep yellow their inferior coverts are yellowish the bill and legs are blackish  In the female the upperpart of the body is olive with a slight appearance of a red crown on the head the underpart of the body is oliveyellow the shape and bulk are the same as in the male  In the young bird all the body is olive with red spots on the forehead the head the throat the breast and the belly  It is the most common of all the species of Manakins in Guiana  Specific character of the Red Manakin  Pipra Aureola  "Black head and breast scarlet white spot on the forepart of the wingquills"  The ORANGE MANAKIN  Le Manakin Orangé  Buff  PipraAureola  var Linn  Manacus Aurantius  Briss  The Black and Yellow Manakin  Edw and Lath  Fourth Species  Edwards is the first author who has given a figure of this bird but he was mistaken in sup∣posing it to be the female of the preceding We have just described the female of the red Man∣akin and the present is undoubtedly a different species since it is extremely rare in Guiana whereas the Red Manakin is very common Linnaeus has fallen into the same error because he only copies Edwards  The head the neck the throat the breast and the belly are of a fine orange all the rest of the plumage being black only the wings are marked with some white spots as in the Red Manakin like that bird too it has blackish legs but a white bill so that notwithstanding the similarity in the bar on the wings in the colour of the legs and in the bulk and shape of the body it cannot be regarded as a variety of the Red Manakin  I The GOLDHEADED MANAKIN  This is the  Pipra Erythrocephala  of Linnaeus and Gmelin the  Manacus Aurocapillus  of Brisson and the  Goldheaded Black Titmouse  of Edwards    II The REDHEADED MANAKIN  This is a variety of the  Pipra Erythrocephala  of Linnaeus and Willughby's  second kind of Tangara    III The WHITEHEADED MANAKIN  This is the  Pipra Leucocilla  of Linnaeus in his last edition the  Parus Pipra  in the eleventh edition the  Pipra Leucocapilla  of Gmelin and the  Whitecapped Manakin  of Edwards and Latham    Fifth Species  We presume that these three birds are only varieties of the same species for they are exactly of the same size being only three inches and eight lines in length whereas all the preceding species which have been placed in the order of their magnitude are four inches and a half and four inches and threefourths c These three are likewise of the same shape and even their colours are similar if we except those of the head which in the first are of a fine yellow in the second of a bright red and in the third of a beautiful blue there is no other sensible dif∣ference in the plumage which is all uniformly of a fine glossy black the feathers which cover the thighs are of a pale yellow with an oblong spot of bright red on the exterior surface In  the first indeed the bill is whitish and the legs black in the second the bill is black and the legs cinereous and in the third the bill is browngray and the legs reddish but these slight dif∣ferences do not appear sufficient to constitute three separate species and perhaps one of them is only the female of another However Mau∣duit to whom I communicated this article assured me that he never saw in the Whiteheaded Manakin the red feathers that cover the knee in the Goldenheaded Manakin if this dif∣ference were invariable we might infer that these formed two separate species of Manakins but Sonini assured us that he has seen Whiteheaded Manakins with red feathers on their knees and there is some reason to suspect that the specimens observed by Mauduit were mu∣tilated  These Manakins are found in the same situa∣tions and are pretty common in Guiana It would even appear that the species is spread through the several other warm countries as Brazil and Mexico We have learnt nothing particular in regard to their instincts and oeco∣nomy We are certain only that like the other Manakins they constantly live in the woods and that they have the chirping common to the whole genus except the Nutcracker  Specific character of the  Pipra Gutturalis  "It is black its throat white"  The WHITETHROATED MANAKIN  Pipra Gutturalis  Linn and Gmel  Manacus Gutture Albo  Briss  VARIETY  This differs from the preceding by the colours of its head which is glossy black like the rest of the plumage except a kind of white collar which rises on the neck and tapers to a point on the breast It is exactly of the same size as the three preceding being only three inches eight lines in length We know not from what country it is brought having seen it only in private cabinets where it was mentioned by this name without any other indication Sonini never met with it in Guiana however it is probably like the three others a native of the warm climates in America  The VARIEGATED MANAKIN  Manacus Serena  Gmel  Manacus Alba Fronte  Briss  The Whitefronted Manakin  Lath  Sixth Species  We have given the epithet of  variegated  be∣cause the plumage is interspersed with spots of  different colours which are all very beautiful and distinct The forehead is of a fine dead white the crown of the head is of a beryl co∣lour the rump of a brilliant blue the belly of a shining orange and all the rest of the plumage of a fine velvet black the bill and legs are black It is the prettiest and smallest of all the Mana∣kins being not more than three inches and a half long and not bigger than a Wren It is found in Guiana whence we received it but it is very rare and we are unacquainted with its ha∣bits  Specific character of the  Manacus Serena  "It is black its front white its rump seagreen its belly fulvous"  Besides the six species and their varieties which we have now described modern nomenclators apply the name of Manakin to four birds men∣tioned by Seba and which we shall here notice only to shew the errors into which such artificial classifications lead  The first is thus described by Seba  Bird called Miacatototl by the Brazilians  This is the  Pipra Torquata  of Gmelin the  Manacus Torquatus  of Brisson and the  Collared Manakin  of Latham    "Its body is ornamented with blackish fea∣thers and its wings with feathers of turkeyblue its head is bloodcoloured and has a gol∣denyellow collar round the neck and throat the  bill and legs are of a pale yellow"  Brisson who had not seen the bird adds the dimensions and other details which are furnished neither by Seba nor by any other author It is also strange that Seba should bestow the appellation of  Mia∣catototl  upon this bird which he says was brought from Brazil for that word is not in the lan∣guage of that country but is a Mexican word and signifies  the Maizebird  But that Seba was mistaken in this application is evinced by the circumstance that Fernandez employs the same term in describing a Mexican bird which is very different His words are these  Of the Miacatototl  or  Maizebird  "It is pretty small so called because it usually sits upon the shoots of maize the belly is palish and the rest of its body black but with white feathers interspersed its wings and tail are ashcoloured below It frequents cool places and is good eating"  Seba has manifestly confounded therefore two different birds under the same name But the description of Fernandez is as imperfect as that of Seba whose figure is still worse so that it is impossible to decide the ar∣rangement  The same is the case with another bird men∣tioned by Seba under the name of  Rubetra  or  Crested American Bird  This is the  Pipra Rubetra  of Linnaeus and Gmelin the  Mana∣cus Cristatus Rufus  of Brisson and the  Yellow Manakin  of Latham    "It is not one of the smallest singing birds" says he "it has a yellow crest its bill too is yellow except the undermandible which is brown the plumage round the neck and on the body is of a yellow rufous the tail and the great quills of the wings are of a shining blue while the small quills are paleyellow"  From this description of Seba Brisson has ven∣tured to range this bird among the Manakins but if he had inspected the figure though it is a very bad one he would have perceived the tail to be very long the bill thin curved and elon∣gated characters quite different from those of the Manakins I should therefore conclude that this bird is still farther removed from the Mana∣kins than the preceding  A third bird which our nomenclators have reckoned a Manakin is that mentioned by Seba under the name of  Picicitli  or  The Least Crested Bird of Brazil  This is the  Pipra Cristata  of Linnaeus and Gmelin the  Mana∣cus Cristatus Ruber  of Brisson and the  Purple Manakin  of Latham    "The body and wings are purple which here and there is deeper the crest is a most beautiful yellow and formed by a small tuft of feathers its bill is pointed and its tail red In short this little bird is very handsome whatever view we take of it"  From this confused de∣scription Brisson concludes the bird to be a Manakin and adds the dimensions and other  circumstances without citing his authorities yet Seba tells us that its bill is pointed and his sigure is very imperfect Besides he is mistaken in asserting that it is a Brazilian bird for the name  Picicitli  is Mexican and Fernandez em∣ploys the same word to describe another bird which is certainly Mexican  "The  Picicitli  is likewise a native of Tetz∣coqua it is very small and its body wholly cinereous except its head and neck which are black with white spots encircling the eyes which are large the front extending on the breast These birds appear after rain If they be raised in the house they soon die They have no song They are excellent food but the In∣dians are uncertain where they breed"  It is easy to see that there is no relation be∣tween this bird and that of Seba who has very injudiciously occasioned a confusion of terms  The same remark may be made with regard to the fourth bird described by Seba under the name of  Coquantototl  or  Small Crested Bird shaped like a Sparrow  This is the  Pipra Grisea  of Gmelin the  Manacus Cristatus Gris∣cus  of Brisson and the  Gray Manakin  of Latham    "Its bill is yellow short curved and bent backwards There is a yellow spot above the eyes the stomach and belly are of a pale bluish yellow the wings are of the same colour and  mixed with some slender carnation feathers but the principal feathers are ashgray the rest of the body is gray there is a small crest behind the head"  From this indication Brisson has inferred that the bird is a Manakin but the shape of the bill is alone sufficient to evince the contrary and besides since it is shaped like a Sparrow its form must be different from that of the Manakins It is evident therefore that this bird whose name also is Mexican is widely re∣moved from the genus of the ManakinsWe shall not venture at present to assign the rank of the four birds but wait till inquisitive travellers may have thrown light upon the subject  SPECIES RELATED TO THE MANAKIN  The WHITE PLUME  Le Plumet Blanc  Pipra Albifrons  var Linn and Gmel  The Whitefaced Manakin  var Lath  THIS species is new It is found in Guiana but rare M de Manoncour presented a specimen to the king's cabinet It is distinguish∣ed by a very long white crest consisting of fea∣thers about an inch in length and which it erects at pleasure It differs from the Manakins by its size being six inches long whereas the largest of the Manakins is only four inches and a half the tail too is long and tapered which in the Manakins is short and square and the bill is much longer in proportion and more hooked than that of the Manakins Indeed the only property in which it resembles the Manakins is the arrangement of the toes and but for this character it might be ranged with the Ant∣eaters we may regard it as forming the inter∣mediate shade We are unacquainted with its oeconomy  The CINEREOUS BIRD OF GUIANA  Pipra Atricapilla  Gmel  The Blackcrowned Manakin  Lath  This species is new We shall only observe that it ought not to be regarded as a true Mana∣kin for its tail is much longer and tapered and its bill is longer but as it resembles the Mana∣kins in the disposition of its toes and in the figure of the bill we ought to place it after them  This bird is found in Guiana but is not fre∣quent It was presented by M De Manoncour to the King's cabinet  The PAPUAN MANAKIN  Lath  Le Manikor  This name is contracted for  Manakin Orangé  Buffon having taken it at first for a Manakin  Buff  Pipra Papuensis  Gmel  This is a new species brought from New Guinea to the King's cabinet by Sonnerat It differs from the Manakins as the two middle quills of the tail are shorter than the lateral ones and as it wants the scallop that occurs on the uppermandible in all the Manakins so that we ought to exclude it from the genus of the Manakins especially as these birds which are natives of America are not probably found in New Guinea  The upperpart of the body is black with greenish reflections the underpart of the body is of a dirty white there is an oblong orange spot on the breast which extends as far as the belly the bill and legs are black But Sonne∣rat could give no information with respect to its manner of living  The COCK OF THE ROCK  Le Coq de Roche  Buff  PipraRupicola  Linn and Gmel  Rupicola  Briss  Upupa Americana Lutea  Ger Orn  Felsenhabn  Walch Natur  The Hoope Hen  Edw  The Crested Manakin  Penn  The Rock Manakin  Lath  THOUGH this bird is of an uniform colour it is one of the most beautiful of South Ame∣rica for this colour is very beautiful and its plu∣mage nicely tapered It feeds upon fruits per∣haps for want of seeds since it differs from the gallinaceous tribe by the shape of its toes only which are connected by a membrane the first and second as far as the third joint and the second with the third no farther than the first joint The tail is very short and square as are some coverts of the wings several of these fea∣thers have a sort of fringe on each side and the first great feather of each wing is scalloped from the tip to one third of its length but what cha∣racterizes it the best is a beautiful crest on the crown longitudinal and of a semicircular form In the minute descriptions which Brisson and Vosmaër have given this crest is imperfectly depicted it is not single but double consisting  THE ROCK MANAKIN  of two inclined planes that meet at the vertex In other respects their descriptions are accurate except that they are applicable only to the male The plumage of the male is of a fine red that of the female is entirely brown only there are some shades of rustcolour on the rump the tail and the feathers of the wings The crest of the female is also double but no so thick so tall so round or so far protruded on the bill as in the male Both male and female are generally thicker and larger than the Ringpigeon but the different individuals probably vary in size for Brisson represents this bird of the bulk of a Romanpigeon and Vosmaër asserts that it is rather smaller than the Common Pigeon This difference might also be occasioned by the man∣ner of stuffing the specimens but in the natural state the female though somewhat smaller than the male is undoubtedly much larger than the Common Pigeon  The male assumes not the fine red till he has attained some age the first year he is only brown like the female but as he grows up his plumage becomes marked with points and spots of rufous which gradually deepen into red though perhaps perfected before advanced age  Though this bird must have attracted the notice of all who ever saw it no traveller has described its habits and oeconomy Sonini de Manoncour is the first who has observed it with attention It lodges not only in the deep clefts  of the rocks but even in the large dark caverns which totally exclude the solar rays a circum∣stance that has induced many to believe it to be a nocturnal bird whereas it flies and sees dis∣tinctly in the daytime however it seems na∣turally to prefer gloomy recesses since it is most frequent in caves which cannot be entered with∣out the light of torches We may therefore pre∣sume that their eyes are constructed like those of cats and adapted both for the day and the night The male and female are equally lively and extremely wild It is impossible to shoot them unless the person be concealed behind a rock where he must often wait several hours before an opportunity occurs for the instant they perceive him they escape to a distance by a flight which is rapid though rather low and short They feed upon small wild fruits and usually scrape the ground clap their wings and shake themselves like the dunghill fowls but they neither crow like the cock nor cluck like the hen Their cry resembles the sound of the syllable  ké  pronounced with a shrill drawling tone They construct their nest rudely in the holes of rocks with small dry sticks and com∣monly lay two white spherical eggs which are of the size of those of pigeons  The males emerge oftener from their caverns than the females which seldom appear and pro∣bably do not quit their retreats except in the night They can easily be tamed and M de  Manoncour saw one at the Dutchpost on the river Maroni which was allowed freely to live and run about with the poultry  They are found in great numbers on the mountain Luca near Oyapoc and on the mountain Courouaye near the river Aprouack and these are the only parts in this region of America whence we can expect to procure these birds They are much esteemed for the sake of their beautiful plumage and are very scarce and dear because the savages and negroes whether from superstition or fear will not venture into the dark caverns where they lodge  Specific character of the  Pipra Rupicola  "It has an erect crest with a purple margin its body is saffron the coverts of its tail are truncated"  The PERUVIAN COCK OF THE ROCK  Pipra Peruviana  Lath  There is another species or rather variety of the Cock of the Rock which is found in the provinces of Peru its tail is much longer than that of the preceding and its feathers have not square ends its wings are not fringed instead of an uniform red both wings and tail are black and the rump cinereous the crest also is differ∣ent being lower and consisting of detached fea∣thers in other respects this Peruvian bird re∣sembles the Guiana Cock of the Rock so closely  that we may regard it as a variety of the same species  We might consider these birds as the repre∣sentatives of our dunghill poultry in the New World but I am told that in the interior parts of Guiana and Mexico there are wild fowls which bear still more analogy These are in∣deed much smaller being scarcely of the size of a Common Pigeon they are generally brown and rufous but they have the same shape the same little fleshy comb on the head and the same port as our ordinary fowl their tail is also similar in shape and position and the males have the crow of the Cock though feebler The savages who inhabit the remote tracts are perfectly well acquainted with these birds but have never reduced them to the domestic state nor is this in the least surprising for they have tamed none of the animals which might have proved useful especially the Hoccos or Curassos the Marails and the Agamis among the birds and the Tapirs the Pecaris and the Agamis among the quadrupeds On the con∣trary the ancient Mexicans who were civilized domesticated some animals and particularly these small brown fowls Gemelli Carreri relates that they were called  Chiacchialacca  and he subjoins that they were precisely like our common poultry only rather smaller and their feathers brownish  The COTINGAS  FEW birds have such beautiful plumage as the Cotingas all those who have had an op∣portunity of seeing them whether travellers or naturalists seem to have been charmed and speak of them with rapture Nature has selected her choicest and her richest colours and spread them with elegance and profusion the painting glows with all the tints of blue of violet of red of orange of purple of snowwhite and glossy black sometimes these tints melt into each other by the sweetest gradations at other times they are contrasted with wonderful taste the various reflexions heighten and enliven the whole The merit is intrinsic it is expressive it is inimitable  All the species or if we chuse all the branches of the brilliant family of the Cotingas belong to the New Continent and there is no foundation for what some have alleged that they are found in Senegal They appear to delight in warm countries they seldom occur south of Brazil or roam north of Mexico and consequently they would hardly traverse the immense stretch of ocean that separates the continents in those latitudes  All that we know of their habits is that they never perform distant journies but have only periodical flittings which are confined within a narrow circle they appear twice ayear in the plantations and though they arrive nearly at the same time they are never observed in flocks They generally haunt the sides of creeks in swampy ground  Mr Edwards who was unacquainted with the oeconomy of the Cotingas conjectured from the structure of their feet that they frequented marshes  which has occasioned some to call them waterfowls They find among the aquatic plants abundance of insects on which they feed and particularly what are termed  karias  in America and which according to some are woodlice and according to others a sort of ants The creoles have it is said more motives than one for hunting after these birdsthe beauty of the plumage which pleases the eye and according to some the delicacy of the flesh which flatters the palate But it is difficult to obtain both for the plu∣mage is often spoiled in attempting to skin the bird and this is probably the reason why so many imperfect specimens are now brought from America It is said that they alight among the ricecrops and do considerable injury if this be true the creoles have still another reason for destroying them  The little which I have related of the habits of the Cotingas was communicated by M Aublet but I must add that M de Manoncour heard that the flesh of the Cotingas was much esteemed at Cayenne perhaps this is true only of some species    THE PURPLERREASTED CHATTERER  The size varies in the different species from that of a small Pigeon to that of a Redwing or even under in all of them the bill is broad at the base the edges of the uppermandible and often those of the lower are scalloped near the tip the first  phalanx  of the outertoe joined to that of the midtoe and lastly in most of them the tail is a little forked or notched and consists of twelve quills  The BLUE RIBAND  Le Cordon Bleu  Buff  AmpelisCotinga  Linn Gmel and Briss  The Purplebreasted Manakin  Called also the  Thrush of RioJaneiro  and the Creoles term it  Hen of the Woods  Penn Edw and Lath  A bright blue is spread on the upperpart of the body of the head and of the neck on the rump the superior coverts of the tail and the small coverts of the wings the same colour appears also on the inferior coverts of the tail the lowerbelly and the thighs A fine violet pur∣ple covers the throat the neck the breast and a part of the belly as far as the thighs and on this ground is traced at the breast a belt of the same blue with that of the back and which has procured this bird the appellation of  Blue Riband  or  Knight of the Holy Ghost  Below the first belt there is in some subjects another of a beautiful red besides many flamespots on the neck and the belly these spots are not disposed regularly but scattered with that negligence in which nature seems to delight and which art labours in vain to imitate  All the quills of the tail and of the wings are black but those of the tail and the middle ones of the wings are edged exteriorly with blue  The specimen which I observed was brought from Brazil its total length was eight inches its bill ten lines its alar extent thirteen inches its tail two inches and twothirds composed of twelve quills and projecting eighteen lines be∣yond the wings The one described by Brisson was every way somewhat larger and of the size of a thrush  The female has neither of these belts nor has it the flamespots on the belly and breast  "At Cayenne there are two other BlueRiband Thrushes says Salerne "which resemble this exactly except that the one wants these spots and the other the BlueRiband"  In every other respect it resembles the male the bill and legs of both are black and the groundcolour of their feathers is blackish and that of the purple feathers white and the  tarsus  is covered behind with a sort of down  Specific character of the  AmpelisCotinga  "It is of a very bright blue below purple its wings and tail black"  The PURPLE THROATED CHATTERER  Le Quereiva  Buff  Ampelis Cayana  Linn and Gmel  Cotinga Cayanensis  Briss  Lanius Ococolin  Klein and Seba  The greatest portion of each of its feathers reckoning from their insertion is black but as the tips are beryl this is really the predominant colour of the plumage In some parts of the upper surface of the body the dark hue strikes through the coverts but then it forms only small specks and it is totally concealed by the blue in the undersurface of the body only in some specimens there are near the rump and the thighs a few small feathers which are partly black and partly purplered  The throat and a part of the neck are covered with a broad spot of a very bright violetpurple which in different subjects varies in extent The coverts of the wings their quills and those of the tail are almost all black edged or tipt with beryl the bill and legs are black  This bird is found in Cayenne it is of the size of the Redwing and fashioned like the preceding except that the wings when closed reach not the middle of the tail which is rather longer  Specific character of the  Ampelis Cayana  "It is bright blue its neck violet below"  The BLUEBREASTED CHATTERER  La Tersine  Buff  Ampelis Tersa  Linn and Gmel  Linnaeus is the first and even the only one who has hitherto described this bird the head the top of the neck the quills of the wings and of the tail are black the throat the breast the lowerpart of the back the outer edge of the quills of the wings light blue there is a transverse bar of light blue on the superior coverts of the same quills the belly is yellowishwhite and the sides are of a deeper cast Linnaeus does not inform us from what country it is brought but it is probable that it is a native of America like the other  Cotingas  I should be even tempted to re∣gard it as a variety of the preceding since blue and black are the prevailing colours of the up∣perpart of the body and the colours of the underpart are dilute as usual in the females the young birds c A sight of the subject would be necessary to decide the question  Specific character of the  Ampelis Tersa  "It is bright blue its back black its belly yellowishwhite"  The SILKY CHATTERER  Le Cotinga à Plumes Soyeuses  Buff  Ampelis Maynana  Linn and Gmel  Cotinga Mayanensis  Briss  Almost all the feathers in the body of this bird and the coverts of the wings and of the tail are unwebbed and parted into filaments so that they resemble silky bristles more than real feathers a property which is sufficient to dis∣tinguish it from all the other Cotingas The general colour of its plumage is bright blue varying into a fine skyblue as in the preced∣ing but we must except the throat which is deep violet and the quills of the tail and of the wings which are blackish most of these are edged exteriorly with blue the feathers of the head and of the upperpart of the neck are long and narrow and the groundcolour is brown that of the feathers of the body and breast c consists of two

wings by an inch  Specific character of the  Ampelis Maynana  "It is bright blue its throat violet"  The POMPADOUR CHATTERER  Le Pacapac  ou  Pompadour  Buff  AmpelisPompadora  Linn Gmel and Borowsk  Cotinga Purpurea  Briss  Turdus Puniceus  Pall  All the plumage of this beautiful bird is bright glossypurple except the quills of its wings which are whitish tipt with brown and the inferior coverts of the wings which are en∣tirely white the underside of the tail is of a lighter purple the ground of the feathers on every part of the body is white the legs are blackish the bill graybrown and on each side of its base rises a small whitish streak which passing under the eyes bounds the face  The great coverts of the wings are oddly fashioned long narrow stiff pointed and spout∣shaped their vanes parted their shaft white and without webs at its tip which resembles in some degree the appendices that terminate the wing in the Common Chatterer  Jaseur  and is nothing but the projection of the shaft beyond the webs This is not the only point of re∣semblance between these two species in the shape of their bill their size the proportional dimensions of their tail their feet c but their instincts are very different since the com∣mon Chatterer prefers the mountains and all the species of  Cotingas  frequent the low marshy grounds  Total length seven inches and a half the bill ten or eleven lines the tarsus nine or ten lines the alar extent above fourteen inches the tail two inches and a half consisting of twelve quills and projecting from six to eight lines beyond the wings  The Pompadour is migratory it appears in Guiana near the inhabited spots in March and September when the fruits on which they feed are ripe they lodge among the large trees on the banks of rivers and nestle on the highest branches but never retire into the wide forestsThe specimen from which this de∣scription was made came from Cayenne  Specific character of the  Ampelis Pompadora  "It is purple

preceding but its proportions are exactly the same the great coverts of its wings have the same singular con∣formation and it inhabits the same country So many common properties leave no room to doubt that though the plumage be different  these two birds belong to the same species and since the present is smaller I should be apt to suppose it to be a young one that has not ac∣quired its full growth or the finished colours of its plumage all that was purple in the preced∣ing is in the present variegated with purple and cinereous the underside of the tail is rose∣coloured the quills of the tail

but which ought not to be confounded with another which is also called the Gray Cotinga and which I shall presently describe under the name of  Guirarou  M de Manoncour has verified our conjectures on the spot In his last voyage to Cayenne he found that the Purplegray Co∣tinga is the young bird and that it takes at least eighteen months to acquire its full colour    It is probable that these are not the only va∣rieties which exist of this species and that others will be found among the females of dif∣ferent ages  The RED CHATTERER  L'Ouette  ou  Cotinga Rouge de Cayenne  Buff  AmpelisCarnifex  Gmel  Lanius Ruber Surinamensis  Ger  Icterus Totus Ruber  Klein  Cotinga Rubra  Briss  Red Bird from Surinam  Edw  The prevailing colour of its plumage is red but diversified by various tints which it assumes in different parts the most vivid which is scarlet is spread over the upperpart of the head and forms a sort of crown or cap of which the fea∣thers are pretty long and are conjectured by Edwards to rise like a crest the same scarlet covers the lowerpart of the belly the thighs the lowerpart of the back and almost to the end of the tailquills which are tipt with black the sides of the head the neck the back and the wings are shaded with deep tints which change the red into a fine soft crimson but the darkest cast is a sort of border which surrounds the scarlet cap and this is a little more dilute be∣hind the neck and on the back and more so on the throat and breast the coverts of the wings are edged with brown and the great quills become more and more obscure and terminate almost in black the bill is a dull red the legs dirty yellow and what is remarkable the tarsus is covered with a sort of down as far as the origin of the toes  The Red Cotinga migrates or rather flits like the Pompadour only it is more common in the interior parts of Guiana  Total length about seven inches the bill nine lines the legs seven lines the tail two inches and a half and projects twenty

this bird and all that he says amounts to no more than that its plumage is white and its cry very loud Since his time the species has been in a manner lost even in Cayenne and M de Manoncour has the merit of rediscover∣ing it  Both the male and the female are figured in the  Planches Enlumineés  They were perched upon trees beside a swamp when they were killed they were betrayed by their cry

sound of the two syllables  in an  uttered with an exceedingly drawling tone  The most remarkable character of these birds is a sort of caruncle under the bill as in the turkies but differently organized it is flaccid and pendulous when the bird is composed at rest but when the passions are rouzed it swells in every dimension and in this state of tension is more than two inches long and three or four lines in circumference at the base this effect is produced by air which is driven through an aperture of the palate into the cavity of the caruncle and inflates it  This caruncle differs from that of the turkey also in another circumstance it is covered with small white feathers and besides it is not peculiar to the male The plumage of the female is however entirely different for in the male the bill and legs are black all the rest of a pure spotless white except some tints of yellow on the rump and on some of the quills of the tail and of the wings but in the female the colour is not so uniform the upperpart of the head and body the superior coverts of the wings and most of the quills of the wings and of the tail are olive mixed with gray the la∣teral  quills of the tail

tail black tipt with white and its superior coverts white lastly the bill and legs are black  The flat shape and the shortness of the bill the loudness of its voice which is somewhat like that of the Blackbird but shriller and its haunt∣ing the margin of water are the chief circum∣stances in which the  Guirarou  resembles the Cotingas its size is also nearly the same and it inhabits the same climates yet Willughby has referred it to the Whiteears and other excel∣lent ornithologists have reckoned it a Flycatcher  For my own part I shall not venture to assign its genus I shall retain the name which it bears in its native climate and wait for fuller observa∣tions made on several living subjects which will point out its proper arrangement The  Guira∣rous  are very common in the interior parts of Guiana but are not found at all in Cayenne they ramble little many occur generally in the same district they perch generally on the lowest branches of certain large trees where they pick up seeds and insects on which they subsist From time to time they cry all at once allowing an interval between each sound this cry though harsh in itself is cheering music to travellers who have lost their way in the immense forests of Guiana for it directs them to the banks of a river  The subject observed by M De Manoncour was nine inches and a half total length its bill twelve inches long seven broad five thick at the base and encirled with hairs the tail was square four inches long and exceeded the wings by two inches and a half the  tarsus  was an inch and so was the bill  I owe these details to M de Manoncour    VARIETY of the GUIRAROU  I Know of one only it is what we have called the  Gray Cotinga  and Daubenton and myself suspect that it is a variety of age because it is smaller its total length being seven inches and a half and its tail rather shorter the wings reach∣ing to the middle and all the other differences result from defect It has neither the black bar under the eyes nor the whitebordered tail nor the white superior coverts the quills of the wings are edged with white but they are not so blackish and those of the tail not so black as in the  Guirarou  Specific character of the  LaniusNengeta  "Its tail wedgeshaped with a white tip its body is cinereous below white"  The ANTERS  Les Fourmiliers  Buff  IN the low swampy thinsettled lands of South America the swarms of insects and loathsome reptiles seem to predominate over all the rest of the animal creation In Guiana and Brazil  This is also the case in many other parts of America Piso relates that in Brazil and even in the wet grounds of Peru the quantity of ants is so enormous that they devour all the seeds which are committed to the earth and though fire and water be employed to extirpate them the attempts have hitherto failed of success He adds that it were much to be wished that Nature had ordained in those countries many species of animals like the Anteaters  Myr∣mecophagae  Linn which might bore into the hillocks and extract these insects with their long tongue Some of the ants are not larger than those of Europe others are twice or thrice as large They raise hills as large as haystacks and their number is so vast that they make tracks several feet broad in the fields and in the woods and often through an extent of many leaguesFernandez says also that these ants are larger and pretty much like our wingedants and that their hills are of an incredible height and width  the ants are so astonishingly multiplied that their hills are some fathoms wide and seve∣ral feet in height and proportionally populous as those of Europe of which the largest are only two or three feet in diameter so that they may be computed to contain two or three hundred times the number of ants Yet they exceed still more in number and in the wildernesses of Guiana they are an hundred times more fre∣quent than in any part of the ancient continent  But such is the system of Nature every crea∣ture is the destined prey of another and gene∣ration and destruction are ever conjoined We have in the former work given an account of the  Tamanoir  of the  Tamandua  and of the other quadrupeds which feed upon ants we are now to write the history of a kind of birds which live also upon these insectsWe were unacquainted with the existence of the Anters till M de Ma∣noncour presented the specimens to the King's cabinet  The Anters are natives of Guiana and are analogous to none of the European birds but in the shape of their body of their bill of their feet and of their tails they bear a great resem∣blance to the shorttailed Thrushes  Breves  which our nomenclators have improperly con∣founded with the Blackbirds but as the shorttailed Thrushes inhabit the Philippines the Mo∣luccas the island of Ceylon Bengal and Mada∣gascar it is more than probable that they are not of the same race with the Anters of Ame∣rica These appear indeed to constitute a new genus for which we are wholly indebted to M de Manoncour whom I have so often cited for his extensive knowledge of foreign birds he has presented above an hundred and sixty different species to the Royal cabinet and has also been so obliging as to communicate to me all the observations which he made in his voy∣ages to Senegal and America I have on many  occasions availed myself of this information and in particular I have formed entirely from it the history of the Anters  In French Guiana and indeed in all countries where natural history is little known names are applied to animals from the slightest analogies This has been the case with the Anters they were observed to perch seldom and run like Partridges but as they were inferior to these birds in size they were distinguished at Ca∣yenne by the appellation of  Little Partridges  But these birds are neither Partridges nor Blackbirds nor shorttailed Thrushes only they resemble the last in their chief external charac∣ters Their legs are long their tail and wings short the nail of the hindtoe more hooked and longer than those of the foretoes the bill strait and lengthened the uppermandible scal∣loped at its extremity which bends at the junc∣tion of the lower mandible and projects about a line beyond it but their tongue is short and beset at the tip with small cartilaginous and fleshy threads Their colours are also very dif∣ferent and it is very probable that their in∣stincts are dissimilar since they inhabit widely distant climates When we described the shorttailed Thrushes we were unable to give any account of their natural habits since no tra∣vellers had taken notice of them and therefore we cannot draw any comparison with those of the American Anters  In general the Anters keep in flocks and feed upon small insects and chiefly ants which are for the most part similiar to those of Europe They are almost always found upon the anthills which in the interior tracts of Guiana are more than twenty feet in diameter and whose insect nations retard the extension of cultivation and even consume the provisions of life  There are several species of Anters which though very different in appearance often asso∣ciate together the large ones and the small the longtailed and the shorttailed are found on the same spot Indeed if we except the principal kind which are very few it is rare to find in the rest two subjects perfectly alike and we may suppose that this diversity arises from the intermixture of the small ones so that we must regard them as mere varieties and not distinct species  In all these birds the wings and tail are very short and therefore ill calculated for flying accordingly they only trip along the ground and hop among the low branches and though lively and active they never shoot through the air  The voice of the Anters is various in the dif∣ferent species and in some it is very singular  As insects are the chief food of these birds they seek the solitary tracts where those are not molested by the intrusion of man and swarm in abundance They live in the thickest and the  remotest forests and never visit the savannas the cleared grounds and still less the neighbour∣hood of plantations They employ dry herbs carelessly interwoven in the construction of their nests which are hemispherical and two three or four inches in diameter and suspend them by the two sides on the bushes two or three feet from the ground They lay three or four eggs which are almost round  The flesh of most of these birds is unpalatable food and has an oily rank taste and when opened the digested mass of ants and of other insects they swallow exhales a putrid offensive smell  The KING OF THE ANTERS  Le Roi des Fourmiliers  Buff  Turdus Rex  Gmel  Turdus Grallarius  Lath Ind  The King Thrush  Lath Syn  First Species  This is the largest and the most unfrequent of all the birds of this genus It is never seen in flocks and seldom in pairs and as it is generally alone among the others and is larger than them it is called  The King of the Anters  It is the more entitled to that appellation as it affects an uncommon distance to other birds and even to those of its own kind If so excellent an ob∣server as M de Manoncour had not communi∣cated the details of its manner of living to dis∣cover  it to be an Anter from the mere inspec∣tion would have been almost impossible for its bill is thicker and differently shaped from that of all the others This bird is generally on the ground and is far from being so lively as the rest who hop around it It frequents the same spots and feeds also upon insects especially ants The female as in all the other species of this genus is larger than the male  Its length from the point of the bill to the end of the tail is seven inches and a half its bill is brown somewhat hooked fourteen lines long and five lines thick at the base which is beset with small whiskers the wings extend the whole length of the tail which is only fourteen lines the legs are brown and two incheslong  The underside of the body is variegated with brown rufous blackish and white the rufous brown is the predominant colour as far as the belly where it grows dilute and the whitish prevails Two white bars descend from the cor∣ners of the bill along with the dusky shade of the throat and neck on the breast is a white spot nearly triangular The upperside of the body is brown rufous shaded with black and white except on the rump and tail where the colour is uniformThe size and the tints are subject to vary in different specimens and we have only described here the more usual appearances  Specific character of the  Turdus Rex  "Its plumage con∣sists of brown and rufous below more dilute the back of its head leadcoloured its front variegated with white and brown"  The AZURIN  Turdus Cyanurus  Gmel  The Bluetailed Thrush  Lath  Second Species  We have described this bird after the Blackbirds and have nothing to add to the former account We remarked that it was undoubtedly not a Blackbird and from its external appear∣ance it ought to be ranged among the Anters We are unacquainted with its oeconomy It is rare in Guiana but was sent however from thence to M Mauduit  The GREAT BELFRY  Le Grand Béfroi  Buff  Turdus Tinniens  Gmel  The Alarum Thrush  Lath  Third Species  We apply the epithet of  Great  only to dis∣tinguish it from another smaller species for its total length exceeds not six inches and a half its tail is sixteen lines and projects six lines be∣yond the wings its bill is eleven lines black above and white below and three lines and a half broad at the base the legs are eighteen  THE ALARUM THRUSH  lines long and as well as the toes are of a light leadcolour  The tints vary in almost each individual and the dimensions are also variable  In some individuals the uppermandible though scalloped and a little hooked exceeds not the under  we have stated the average  In this species the females are much larger than the males and still more disproportioned than in the first species in this respect the Anters resemble the birds of prey  What most remarkably distinguishes this bird which we have named  Belfry  is the singular sound that it makes in the evenings and morn∣ings this resembles the din of an alarumbell Its voice is so strong that it can be heard at a great distance and one would hardly suppose it emitted by so small a bird The succession of sounds which is as rapid as the quick strokes of a bell continues about an hour It appears to be a sort of call similar to that of the Par∣tridges only it is heard at all seasons and every day at the rising of the sun and before his setting however as the period of love is not fixed in those hot climates the Partridges as well as the Anters have their call in every sea∣son indiscriminately  The King of the Anters and the Belfry are the only birds of the genus that are palatable food  Specific character of the  Turdus Tinniens  "It is brown above white below its breast spotted with black its tail equal"  The SMALL BELFRY  Le Petit Béfroi  Buff  Turdus Lineatus  Gmel  The Speckled Thrush  Lath  VARIETY  Its length five inches and a half the upperpart of the body is olive which grows more dilute on the rump the tail of which the quills are brown as well as those of the wings exceeds these by ten lines the underpart of the throat is white and the feathers below be∣come gray and spotted with rusty brown as far as the belly which is entirely rusty brown  From this description it is easy to perceive the striking resemblance of colours between this bird and the Great Belfry and the figure is pre∣cisely the same  The PALIKOUR or ANTER properly so called  Turdus Formicivorus  Gmel  The Ant Thrush  Lath  Fourth Species  It is near six inches long its body not so thick as that of the Little Belfry and its bill longer than in that species its iris reddish and its eyes encircled by a skin of skyblue the legs and the lower mandible of the same colour  The throat the forepart of the neck and the top of the breast are covered with a cravat of black with a black and white border which extends behind the neck and forms a halfcollar the rest of the underpart of the body is cinereous  The birds of this species are very lively but fly not more than the others in open air they climb among the bushes like magpies expand∣ing the feathers of their tail  They make a sort of quavering interrupted by a feeble cry which is abrupt and shrill  Their eggs are brown and nearly as large as those of sparrows the great end is sprinkled with spots of a deep brown the nest is thicker and closer interwoven than those of the other Anters and is covered externally with more than one layer of moss  The COLMA  Buff  Turdus Colma  Gmel  The Rufousnaped Thrush  Lath  The Colma may likewise be considered as a variety of the preceding or as a closelyrelated species all the plumage of its body is brown be∣low it is browngray and on the belly cinereous only on the lowerpart of the head behind the neck there is a sort of rufous halfcollar and the throat is white dotted with browngray We have formed its name  Colma  from this last character In some subjects the rufous halfcollar is wanting  The TÉTÉMA  Buff  Turdus Colma  Variety  This is a native of Cayenne and seems to resemble much the preceding not only in size which is the same and in shape which is nearly similar but in the disposition of the colours which are almost the same on all the upperpart of the body The greatest difference occurs on the throat the breast and the belly which are blackish brown whereas in the Colma the origin of the neck and throat are white varie∣gated  with small brown spots and the breast and belly are ashgray which would induce us to suppose that the differences are only sexual In that case I should reckon the Tétéma as the male and the Colma as the female because its colours are generally more dilute  The CRESTED ANTER  Le Fourmilier Huppé  Buff  Turdus Cirrhatus  Gmel  The Blackcrested Thrush  Lath  Fifth Species  The average length of this bird is near six inches the upperpart of the head is decorated with long black feathers which it can erect at pleasure like a crest the iris is black the underpart of the throat is covered with black and white feathers the breast and the underpart of the neck are blackall the rest of the body is ashgray  The tail is two inches four lines in length and consists of twelve tapered quills  In all the species of the Anters the tail is more or less taper∣ed those which have it larger than the rest have it also thinner and the quills weaker  edged and tipt with white and exceeds the wings an inch whose superior coverts are tipt with white and in some subjects they are of the general colour of the body or ashgray  The female has also a crest or rather the same long feathers on the head but they are rufous and its plumage differs from that of the male in nothing except a slight shade of rusty upon the gray  These birds have a cluck like that of a pullet they lay three eggs  M de Manoncour found in the month of December several young of this species ready to fly He tried in vain to rear some of them for they all died in the space of four days though they ate very heartily crumbs of bread  and breed several times annually  The WHITEEARED ANTER  Turdus Auritus  Gmel  Pipra Leucotis  Gmel  The Whiteeared Manakin  Lath  The Whiteeared Thrush  Lath  Sixth Species  It is four inches nine lines in length the upperpart of the head is brown and the lower sides of the forepart of the head and throat are black a small bar of shining white stretches from the posterior angle of the eye to below the head where the feathers are broader and longer than those of the head  There is nothing remarkable in the rest of the plumage the colour of the upperpart of the body is an unpleasant mixture of olive and  rusty The superior part of the undersides of the body is rufous and the rest gray  The tail is fifteen lines in length the wings extend its whole length the legs are brown the habits of the bird are the same as those of the preceding kinds  The CHIMER  La Carrillouneur  Buff  Turdus Tintinnabullatus  Gmel  Turdus Campanella  Lath Ind  The Chiming Thrush  Lath Syn  Seventh Species  The total length of this bird is four inches and a half and its tail projects nine lines be∣yond the wings  Besides the habits common to the Anters the Chimer has others peculiar to itself it haunts the grounds where the ants abound but does not intermingle with the rest it generally forms small separate parties of four or six they hop about and utter a very singular cry exactly like the chime of three differenttoned bells their voice is sonorous considering the smallness of their size We might suppose that they sing their parts though it is likely that each sounds succes∣sively the three notes but we are not certain as no person has ever been at the trouble to do∣mesticate  them Their voice is not so loud as that of the Great Belfry which is indeed equal to that of a bell of considerable size and the Chimers are not distinctly audible farther than fifty paces while the Belfry may be heard at the distance of half a league These birds con∣tinue their chiming without intermission for whole hours  The species is very rare and found only in the still forests in the heart of Guiana  Specific character of the Chimer  Turdus Tintinnabulatus  "Its crown and temples white spotted with black its eyebrows black its chin white its breast carnation spotted with black its back its wings and its tail brown its rump its belly and vent orangerufous"  The BAMBLA  TurdusBambla  Gmel  The Blackwinged Thrush  Lath  Eighth Species  We have given it this name because there is a white transverse bar on each wing  bande∣blanche  The habits of the bird are unknown but from its resemblance to the other Anters I should infer that it belongs to the same genus though still a distinct species  Besides these eight species of Anters we have seen three others which were brought from  Cayenne but without the least account of their natural habits  Specific character of the  Turdus Bambla  "It is spotted above it is duskyrufous below cinereous its wings black and has a transverse white stripe"  The ARADA  Buff  Turdus Cantans  Gmel  The Musician Thrush  Lath  This was called by M de Manoncour the  Musician of Cayenne  I rather chuse to retain the name of  Arada  which it receives in its native country  It is not exactly an Anter but we have placed it after these because it has the same external characters though it differs in its ha∣bits It perches upon trees and never alights on the ground except to pick up ants and other insects upon which it feeds It is distinguished from them by a remarkable property for all the Anters utter harsh cries without any molestation while the Arada has the most charming warble It commences often with the seven notes of the octave and then whistles different soft varied airs which are lower than those of the Night∣ingale and more like the breathing of a sweet toned flute and it is said to excel even that ce∣lebrated chorister of the grove in delicate tender  melody It has also a sort of whistle resembling that by which a person calls upon another tra∣vellers frequently mistake this sound and by following it they are led more astray for as they approach the bird continually recedes and whistles at intervals  The Arada avoids settled spots it lives alone in the depth of the vast forests and the softness of its melody seems in some measure to relieve the gloomy stillness around It is one of the very few birds in the New World which Nature has distinguished by the charms of its song But the species is not numerous and the traveller may frequently pursue his pathless journey without meeting a single Arada to sooth his sympathetic gloom  The colours of its plumage correspond not with the richness of its song they are dull and obscureThe total length is four inches and the tail is radiated transversely with rufous brown and blackishit exceeds the wings by seven lines  To the Arada we may refer a bird which Mauduit shewed to us it resembles that in the length and shape of its bill the form of its tail the length of its legs in having some white feathers mixed with the brown ones on the sides of the neck the size is nearly equal and the shape similar but the tip of its bill is more hooked its throat is white with a halfcollar of black below and its plumage is uniform  and not striped with brown lines as in the Arada whose throat and underpart of its neck are red We may presume therefore that this bird is either a distinct variety of the Arada or a contiguous species since it inhabits Cayenne though being unacquainted with its habits we shall not at present presume to decide the matter  Specific character of the  Turdus Gantans  "It is brownrufous variegated with blackish transverse streaks be∣low partly white its chin its cheeks and its throat orangerufous a black space spotted with white on each side of the neck"    The NIGHTINGALE ANTERS  Les Fourmiliers Rossignols  Buff  In their external figure these birds are inter∣mediate between the Anters and the Nightin∣gales their bill and feet are like those of the Anters and their long tail resembles that of the Nightingale's They live in flocks in the vast forests of Guiana they run upon the ground and hop among the low branches but fly not in open air they feed upon ants and other small insects they are very nimble and when they frisk about they make a sort of quavering succeeded by a feeble shrill cry which they repeat several times when they call upon each other  We know only two species  The CORAYA  Buff  Turdus Coraya  Gmel  The Barredtail Thrush  Lath  First Species  We have given it this name because its tail is radiated transversely with blackish  queue∣rayée  The length is five inches and a half from the point of the bill to the end of the tail the throat and the forepart of the neck are white the breast is less white and receives a cinereous shade there is a little of rusty under the belly and on the thighs the head is black and the upperpart of the body rufousbrown the tail is tapered and two inches long and extends at least eighteen lines beyond the wings the hind nail is as in the Anters the longest and strongest of all  The ALAPI  Buff  Turdus Alapi  Gmel  The Blackheaded Thrush  Lath  Second Species  It is rather larger than the preceding being six inches long its throat the forepart of its neck and breast are black the rest of the underpart of the body cinereous an olivebrown is  spread over the upperpart of the head neck and back the rest of the upperpart of the body is deeper cinereous than that of the belly there is a white spot on the middle of the back the tail is blackish and somewhat tapered pro∣jecting one inch and a half beyond the wings the quills of which are brown above and below and the superior coverts are of a very deep brown dotted with white whence its name  Alapi ailes Piquetées  The female has not the white spot on the back its throat is white and the rest of the underpart of the body rusty with ashgray feathers on the sides of the lowerbelly and on what form the inferior coverts of the tail the points of the coverts of the wings are also rusty and that of the upperpart of the body is not so deep as in the male  These shades and even the colours them∣selves vary in different subjects as we have had occasion to observe with regard to the Anters  The AGAMI  It is called  Trompetero  by the Spaniards of the province of Maynas and  Agami  by the French at Cayenne    Buff  Psophia Crepitans  Linn Gmel and Borowsk  Grus Psophia  Pall  Phasianus Antillarum  Briss  L'Oiseau Trompette  Descr Surin  The Goldbreasted Trumpeter  Lath  TO avoid confusion we shall restore to this bird the name of  Agami  which it has ever received in its native region In a preceding part of the present work we were deceived by the account of Father Dutertre and have men∣tioned it by the appellation of  Caracara  but that term was bestowed by Marcgrave upon a bird of prey totally different from the  Agami  Naturalists have entertained the most opposite opinions with regard to this bird Dutertre supposes it to be a Pheasant Barrere reckons it a Wild Hen Pallas terms it a Crane and Adanson seems to insinuate that it is a large aquatic bird of the genus of the Lapwing be∣cause its knees are prominent and its hindtoe is placed a little higher than the three foretoes and because it appears the intermediate kind between the  Jacana  and the  Kamichi  THE GOLDBREASTED TRUMPETER  But the Agami is quite a distinct race It re∣sembles indeed the aquatic birds in the charac∣ter which Adanson has properly remarked and also the greenish colour of the legs but its nature is entirely different It inhabits the arid mountains and the upland forests and never visits the fens or the margins of waterWe have here another example of the errors into which artificial systems lead  Nor is it a Pheasant or Curasso for not only are its legs and thighs different but its toes and nails are much shorter Still more is it widely separated from the Common Hen and it can∣not be ranged with the Cranes since its bill its neck and its neck and its legs are much shorter than in the aquatic birds  The Agami is twentytwo inches long its bill which is exactly like that of the gallinaceous tribe is twentyone lines its tail is very short not exceeding three inches and onefourth and is concealed by the superior coverts and does not project beyond the wings its legs are five inches high and completely covered with small scales as in the other gallinaceous birds and these scales reach two inches above the knees which are not feathered  The whole of its head its throat and the upper half of its neck both above and below are covered with a short down which is very close and feels very soft the forepart of the lower surface of the neck and the breast are covered  with a beautiful gorget four inches broad whose brilliant colours vary between green gold green blue and violet the upperpart of its back and the contiguous portion of its neck are black the plumage changes on the hindpart of the back into a tawnyrufous but all the underside of the body is black and also the wings and the tail only the great feathers which ex∣tend on the rump and the tail are light ash∣coloured the legs are greenish  The nomenclators  Barrère Brisson Vosmaër c  have also confounded the Agami with the  Macucagua  of Marcgrave which is the great  Tinamou  and of which we shall treat in the following article under the name of  Magua  Adanson is the first who de∣tected this error  Pallas  "The larynx which without the breast is of the thickness of a swan's quill and almost bony grows much slenderer at its en∣trance into the breast looser and cartilaginous whence proceed two semicylindrical canals formed of membranes and capable of extension  "The airbag on the rightside descends to the pelvis and within the breast it is divided into three or four cells by transverse membranous diaphragms That on the leftside is much narrower andterminates in the loins"  Miscel Zoolog  p  and Vosmaër  The most characteristic and remarkable property of these birds consists in the wonderful noise which they often make either of themselves or when urged by the keepers of the  menagerie  I do not wonder that hitherto they have been supposed to form this through the anus It cost me no little trouble to convince myself of the contrary To succeed one must be on the ground and with a bit of bread entice the bird to come near then make the noise which the keepers can well imitate and often dispose the Agami to repeat it This equivocal noise is sometimes preceded by a savage cry interrupted by a sound approaching that of  scherck scherck  to which succeeds the hollow singular noise in question which re∣sembles somewhat the moan of pigeons In this way it utters five six or seven times with precipitation a hollow noise emitted from within its body nearly as if one pronounced  tou tou tou tou tou tou  with the mouth shut resting upon the last  teu  a very long time and terminating by sinking gradually with the same note This sound also resembles much the lengthened doleful noise which the Dutch bakers make by blowing a glass trumpet to inform their customers when the bread comes out of the oven This sound as I have already said issues not from the anus yet I am very confident that it is formed by a slight opening of the bill and by a sort of lungs peculiar to almost all birds though of a dif∣ferent form This is also the opinion of M Pallas who heard it often with me and to whom I gave one of the dead birds for dis∣section" The doctor has communicated to me his observations with respect to the internal structure of the animal for which I am much obliged to him  "The windpipe" says he "before its entrance into the breast is as thick as a large writingpen bony and quite cylindrical In the breast it becomes cartilaginous and divides into two semicircular canals which pass through the lungs the left one being very short but the right one reaching the bottom of the lower belly and parted by transverse membranes into three or four lobes"  These lungs therefore are undoubtedly the instrument of the various cries emitted by birds The air pressed by the impulsive action of the fibres seeks to escape through the large branches of the fleshy lungs and meets with an obstruction from the little elastic membranes which produces pulsations the origin of all sorts of sounds  Memoires de l'Academie des Sciences  année  p  But what above all convinces us that this noise proceeds not from the anus if a person observes attentively when the bird makes it he will perceive the breast and belly to heave and the bill to open somewhat  VOSMAER  Amsterdam    have accurately ascer∣tained the singular power which this bird has of  emitting a dull hollow sound which was sup∣posed to come from the anus  M de la Condamine entertained this opinion  Voyage des Amaxons  p  and have disco∣vered  that this is a mistaken notion We shall only observe that in many birds as well as in the Agami the windpipe is bony at its opening and becomes cartilaginous in its descent and in general the cries of such birds are deep but there are also many birds on the other hand whose windpipe is cartilaginous at its rise and termi∣nates bony in the breast and these have com∣monly shrill notes  The odd sort of noise which this bird makes is probably owing to the extent of lungs and the capacity of their membranous cells But it is unnecessary to suppose with Vosmaër that the Agami is obliged to open its bill a little in order to give passage to the sound for any sudden motion in the bowels is communicated through the muscles and teguments to the external air which conveys the impulse to the ear We have often occasion to notice this circumstance and it appears to be prejudice that the sounds pro∣duced by animals are always transmitted through the throat or through the alimentary canal Nor is this species of ventriloquism peculiar to the Agami the Curasso without opening its bill makes a similar hollow sound which is even more articulate and more powerful Indeed the same property seems to obtain though in a less degree in many kinds of birds in which the lungs are proportionally larger than in the qua∣drupeds The hoarse murmur which the Turkeycock makes before his gobble the cooing which  the Pigeon effects without motion of the mouth are of this nature only in these the sound rises near the bottom of the throat but in the Cu∣rasso and especially in the Hocco it has its ori∣gin deeper  In regard to the manner in which the Agami lives in the domestic state I shall quote the words of Vosmaër  "When these birds are well kept they are attentive to cleanliness and often peck the feathers of the body and wings with their bill if they frolic with each other they per∣form all their movements by hopping and vio∣lently flapping their wings The change of food and of climate certainly cools here in Holland their natural ardor for propagation Their ordinary subsistence is grain such as buckwheat c but they also eat readily small fish flesh and bread This fondness for fish and the uncommon length of their legs shew that they partake of the nature of the Herons and Cranes and that they belong to the class of the aquatic birds"  We must observe here that the fond∣ness for fish is no proof since poultry are as greedy of this sort of food as of any other  "What  Pistorius  relates" continues Vosmaër "with respect to the gratitude of this bird may put many to the blush When tamed it distin∣guishes its master and benefactor with marks of its affection Having reared one I had an op∣portunity of experiencing this myself when I opened its cage in the morning the kind ani∣mal  hopped round me expanding both his wings and  trumpeting  this is the term which we may employ to express the noise from his bill and behind as if he wished me good mor∣ning He shewed no less attention when I went out and returned again no sooner did he per∣ceive me from a distance than he ran to meet me and even when I happened to be in a boat and set my foot on shore he welcomed me with the same compliments which he reserved for me alone and never bestowed them upon others"  We shall subjoin a number of additional facts which were communicated by M de Manon∣cour  In the state of nature the Agami inhabits the vast forests in the warm climates of America and never visits the cleared grounds still less the settled spots It associates in numerous flocks and prefers not the swamps and sides of lakes for it is often found on the mountains and in hilly situations It walks and runs rather than flies since it never rises more than a few feet and only to reach some short distance or to gain some low branch It feeds upon wild fruits like the Curassos the Marails and other gallinaceous birds When surprised in its haunts it makes its escape by swiftness of feet seldom using its wings and at the same time emits a shrill cry like that of the Turkey  These birds scrape the earth at the roots of the large trees to form a bed for their eggs and  employ no lining and construct no nest They lay many eggs from ten to sixteen but the number is proportioned as in all other birds to the age of the female they are almost spherical larger than hens eggs and tinged with light green The young Agamis retain their down or rather their first dishevelled feathers much longer than our chickens or infantpartridges these are sometimes near two inches long and before a certain age they might pass for animals covered with silky hairs which are close like fur and feel soft the true feathers appear not till they have attained the fourth of their full growth  The Agami is not only tamed easily but be∣comes attached to its benefactor with all the fondness and fidelity of dogs and of this dis∣position it shews the most unequivocal proofs When bred up in the house it loads its master with caresses and follows his motions and if it conceives a dislike to persons on account of their forbidding figure their offensive smell or of in∣juries received it will pursue them sometimes to a considerable distance biting their legs and tes∣tifying every mark of displeasure It obeys the voice of its master and even answers to the call of all those to whom it bears no grudge It is fond of caresses and offers its head and neck to be stroked and if once accustomed to these fa∣miliarities it becomes troublesome and will not be satisfied without continual fondling It makes  its appearance as often as its master sits down to table and begins with driving out the dogs and cats and taking possession of the room for it is so obstinate and bold that it never yields and often after a tough battle can put a middlesized dog to flight It avoids the bites of its anta∣gonist by rising in the air and retaliates with violent blows with its bill and nails aimed chiefly at the eyes and after it gains the superiority it pursues the victory with the utmost rancour and if not parted will destroy the fugitive By its intercourse with man its instincts became moulded like those of dogs and we are as∣sured the Agamis can be trained to tend a flock of sheep It even shews a degree of jealousy of its rivals for when at table it bites fiercely the naked legs of the negroes and other do∣mestics who come near its master  The flesh of these birds especially when they are young is not illflavoured but is dry and commonly hard The rich brilliant part of the plumage which covers the breast is separated from the rest and prepared for the ornaments of dress  M De la Borde has also communicated the following particulars in regard to this bird  "The wild Agamis" says he "are dispersed in the back country and are no longer found in the neighbourhood of Cayenne and they are very common in the remote unsettled tracts They are always found in the im∣mense  forests in flocks from ten and twelve to forty They fly from the ground to the low trees where they remain still and in such situation the hunters often kill several without scaring away the rest Some persons imitate their hoarse murmur so exactly as to decoy them to their feet When the hunters discover a flock of Agamis they de∣sist not till they have killed several these birds seldom or never fly and their flesh is but ordinary black and always hard however that of the young ones is more palatable No bird is so easily tamed as this and there are always many of them in the streets of Cayenne They even roam out of town but return in due time to their master They allow one to come near them and handle them at pleasure they are afraid neither of dogs nor of birds of prey in the courtyard they assume the ascendency over the poultry and keep them in great subjection they feed like the hens the  Marils  and the  Paraguas  but when very young they prefer small worms and flesh to every thing else  "Almost all the birds have a trick of follow∣ing people through the streets and out of town even persons that they had never seen before It is difficult to get rid of them if you enter a house they will wait your return and again join you though often after an interval of three hours"  "I have sometimes" adds M  de la Borde "betaken myself to my heels but they ran faster and always got before me and when I stopped they stopped also I know one which invariably follows all the strangers who enter its master's house ac∣companies them into the garden takes as many turns as they do and attends them back again  Note communicated by M de la Borde King's physician as Cayenne in  "  As the habits and oeconomy of this bird were little known I have thought proper to transcribe the different accounts which I have received It appears that of all the feathered tribes the Agami is the most attached to the society of man and in this respect it is as eminently distinguished above them all as the dog is above the other quadrupeds The disposition of the Agami is the more remarkable since it is the only bird that has a social turn whereas several of the quadrupeds discover attachment to man though inferior in degree to that of the dog And is it not strange that an animal so pecu∣liarly formed for society has never been do∣mesticated Nothing can better shew the im∣mense distance between the civilized man and the rude savage than the dominion obtained over the lower creation The former has made the dog the horse the ox the camel the ele∣phant the reindeer c subservient to his utility or his pleasure he has drawn together  the hens the geese the turkies and the ducks and has lodged the pigeons The savage has overlooked advantages the most obvious and the most essential to his comfort It is society that gives spring to activity that awakens the dormant faculties and that expands informs and enlivens the whole  Specific character of the Goldbreasted Trumpeter  "Its head and breast are smooth and shining green"  The TINAMOUS  This is the name given to these birds in Guiana    THESE birds which are peculiar to the warm parts of America may be regarded as a part of the gallinaceous class for they resemble the Bustard and Partridge though they differ in several properties But there are certain habits in animals which result from the nature of the climate and from local circumstances and which ought not to be deemed essential charactersThus many birds such as Partridges which remain constantly on the ground in Europe perch in America and even the palmated aqua∣tic fowls pass the day in the water and return to lodge during the night among the trees The dangers with which they are surrounded appear to drive them to such retreats The im∣mense swarms of insects and reptiles engendered by the heat and the moisture of the climate threaten every moment their destruction If they ventured to repose upon the ground the dense columns of ants would attack them in their slumbers and reduce them to skeletons The Quails are the only birds in those countries which rest upon the surface and they often fall a prey to the voracity of the serpents Nor is it im∣probable  that the Quails have been introduced since the discovery of America and that they have not yet acquired the habits suited to their new situation or learned to guard against the assaults of their numerous foes  We should have ranged the genus of the  Ti∣namous  after that of the Bustard but these birds were at that time but imperfectly known and we are indebted to M de Manoncour for the prin∣cipal facts relating to their history and also for the specimens presented to the Royal Cabinet from which we have made the descriptions  The Spanish inhabitants of America  Letter of M Godin des Odonnais to M de la Condamine p note first  and the French settlers at Cayenne have both termed these birds  Partridges  and the appellation has been adopted by some nomenclators  BrissonBarrere  though altogether improper for the  Tinamous  are dis∣tinguished by their long slender bill blunt at the tip black above and whitish below their nostrils oblong and placed near the middle of their bill their hindtoe is very short and does not rest upon the ground their nails are very short broad and channelled beneath their legs also differ from those of Partridges being covered behind as in the poultry with scales their whole length shaped like small shells but the upperpart projects and forms inequalities not observed on the legs of poultry In all the Tinamous  the throat and craw are thinly strewed with straggling feathers the quills of the tail are so short that in some they are wholly concealed by the superior covertsThus they are improperly named Partridges since they differ in so many essential characters  But they differ also from the Bustard by se∣veral of their principal characters and especi∣ally by having a fourth toe behind which is wanting in the Bustard In short we have judged it requisite to range them in a separate genus under the name which they receive in their native country  All the species of the Tinamous pass the night upon the trees and sometimes perch during the day but they always settle among the lowest branches and never mount to the summits and this circumstance seems to imply the probability that they are not actuated by original impulse but directed by considerations of safety  The Tinamous are in general excellent for the table their flesh is white firm close and juicy especially about the wings and tastes like that of the Red Partridge The thighs and rump have commonly a disagreeable bitterness which is occasioned by the fruit of the Indian reed upon which they feed The same bitter taste is observed in the RingPigeons which eat these fruits But when the Tinamous live upon other fruits such as wild cherries c their flesh is uniformly delicate but still has none  of the  fumet  In the sultry humid climate of Cayenne meat will not keep more than twentyfour hours from putrefaction and no sort of game can be allowed time to mellow and ac∣quire that delicious flavour which constitutes its excellence These birds like all those which have a craw often swallow the fruits without bruising or even cracking them they are par∣ticularly fond of the wild cherries and also of the produce of the  common palm  and even of that of the coffeeshrub when they can find it Nor do they cull their subsistence from the trees they only collect the fruits which have dropped They scrape the ground to form their nest which is usually nothing but a single layer of dry herbs They lay twice ayear and have numerous broods which shews that these birds and the Agamis are of the gallinaceous class which is remark∣ably prolific Like these also they fly heavily and to short distances but run swiftly on the ground they form little flocks and it is un∣common to find them either single or in pairs they call each other in all seasons in the morn∣ing and evening and sometimes too during the day this call is a slow quavering plaintive whistle which the fowlers imitate to bring them near for this game is the most common and the best which that country affords  We shall add a remarkable circumstance with respect to these genus of birds that as in the Anters the female is larger than the male a  property which in Europe is found only in the rapacious tribe In the shape of the body however and in the distribution of the colours the females are almost entirely like the males  The GREAT TINAMOU  Le Magoua  Buff  Tinamus Brasiliensis  Lath Ind  Tetras Major  Gmel  Perdix Brasiliensis  Briss  Macucagua  Ray Will and Klein  First Species  This bird is as large as a Pheasant and ac∣cording to Marcgrave it has twice as much flesh as a plump hen  This bird eats according to that author wild beans and the fruit of a tree called in Brazil  araeicu  The throat and the lowerpart of the belly are white the upperpart of the head is deep rufous the rest of the body is of a browngray variegated with white on the top of the belly the sides and the coverts of the thighs there is a little greenish on the neck the breast the rife of the back and the superior coverts of the wings and of the tail on which some blackish transverse spots are observed that are less numerous on the coverts of the tail the browngray is deeper on the rest of the body and variegated with black transverse spots  THE GREAT TINAMOU  which are less frequent near the rump there are also some small black spots on the lateral quills of the tail the middle quills of the wings are variegated with rufous and browngray and terminated by a rusty border the great quills are cinereous without any spots or border the legs are blackish and the eyes black and a little behind them the ears are placed as in the poultry Piso remarks that the internal structure of this bird is exactly like that of the hen  The size varies in different subjects the ave∣rage measures are total length fifteen inches the bill twenty lines the tail three inches and a half the legs two inches and threefourths the tail projects an inch and two lines beyond the wings  The call of the Great Tinamou is a hollow sound which may be heard at a great distance and is whistled precisely at six o'clock in the evening the time when the sun sets in that latitude It is silent during the night unless it be scared  The female lays twelve or fifteen eggs which are almost round rather larger than hens eggs of a beautiful greenish blue and are excellent eating  Specific character of the  Tinamus Brasilienfis  LATH  "It is duskyolive spotted with dusky its belly whitish and va∣riegated the thighs rough behind"  The CINEREOUS TINAMOU  Tinamus Cinereus  Lath Ind  Tetrao Cinereus  Gmel  Second Species  The epithet  cinereous  will serve for a descrip∣tion of this bird for that colour is uniform over the whole body except a tint of rufous on the head and the top of the neck It has the same shape as the other only it is smaller It is a new species communicated by M de Manoncour It is of all the Tinamous the least frequent in Cayenne  Its length is a foot its bill sixteen lines its tail two inches and a half and its legs the same  Specific character of the  Tinamus Cinereus  LATH  "It is cinereousbrown its head and neck tawny"  The VARIEGATED TINAMOU  Tinamus Variegatus  Lath Ind  Tetrao Variegatus  Gmel  Third Species  This species which is the third in the order of size differs from the two first by its variegated  plumage The Creoles of Cayenne call it the  Pintado Tinamou  but this appellation is impro∣per for it bears no resemblance to the Pintado and its striped plumage is not dotted Its throat and the middle of its belly are white its tail its breast and the top of its belly rufous its sides and its thighs striped obliquely with white with brown and with rufous the upperpart of its head and the top of its neck black all the upperpart of its body the superior coverts of its tail and of its wings and the middle quills of its wings striped transversely with black and olive brown deeper on the back and lighter on its rump and on its flanks the great quills of its wings are brown and uniform without a spot its legs are blackish  Its total length is eleven inches its bill fifteen lines its tail two inches and exceeds the wings by six lines  It is pretty common in Guiana though not so numerous as the Great Tinamous which occur in∣deed the most frequently in the woods for none of these three species haunt the cleared ground The female Variegated Tinamou lays ten or twelve eggs which are rather smaller than those of the hen Pheasant and are uniformly tinged with a beautiful black  Specific character of the  Tinamus Variegatus  of LATH  "It is striped with rufous brown and blackish below rufous with a black cap its throat and the middle of its belly white"  The LITTLE TINAMOU  Le Soui  Buff  TinamusSoui  Lath Ind  TetraoSoui  Gmel  Fourth Species  Soui is the name by which this bird is known in Guiana and which was given by the natives of the country It is the smallest of the genus not exceeding eight or nine inches in length and not being larger than a Partridge Its flesh is as delicate as that of the other kinds but it lays only five or six eggs and sometimes no more than three or four which are rather larger than Pigeons eggs they are almost spherical and as white as those of hens The Little Tina∣mous do not form their nest like the Great Ti∣namous by scraping the ground they build it with long narrow leaves on the lowest branches of shrubs it is hemispherical about six inches in diameter and five inches high Of all the four species this is the only one which does not live constantly in the woods it often frequents the young straggling trees and bushes which shoot up in land that has been cultivated and abandoned and sometimes it even visits dwellings  Its throat is variegated with white and rufous all the underpart of its body and the coverts of its thighs are of a lightrufous the upperpart of its head and of its neck are black the lowerpart of its neck its back and all the underpart of its body are brown radiated with dull blackish its superior coverts and the middle quills of its wings are brown edged with rufous the great quills of its wings are brown without any spots or borders its tail projects ten lines beyond its wings but is exceeded by its own coverts  Specific character of the  TinamusSoui  of LATH  "It is clouded with brown below rufous its throat variegated with white the upperpart of its head and the hindpart of its neck black"  The TOCRO  Tetrao Guianensis  Gmel  Perdix Guianensis  Lath Ind  The Partridge of Guiana  Buff  THE Tocro is somewhat larger than our Gray Partridge and its plumage deeper but in other respects it is exactly similar in its figure in the proportions of its body in the shortness of its tail and in the shape of its bill and legs The natives of Guiana call it  Tocro  a name which well expresses its cry  These Partridges of the New World have nearly the same habits as those of Europe only they still continue in the forests because they have not been accustomed to cleared grounds They perch on the low branches of the bushes but only to pass the night which is to avoid the damp and perhaps the swarms of insects They lay commonly twelve or fifteen eggs which are entirely white the flesh of the young ones is excellent but has no  fumet  The old ones are also eaten and are even more de∣licate than ours but the rapid progress of pu∣trefaction in those climates will not allow suf∣ficient time for acquiring the proper flavour  As our Gray Partridges do not intermix with our Red Partridges it is highly probable that the Brown Partridges of America would breed with neither and consequently are a separate species  Specific character of the  Perdix Guianensis  of LATH  "It is rufousbrown spotted and variegated its throat is cine∣reous a fulvous fillet passes over its eyes its wingquills are marked externally with rufous spots"  The FLYCATCHERS  Les GobeMouches Moucherolles Tyrans  Buff  NATURE has assigned these a place after the humblest of the rapacious tribes They are harmless and even useful they consume not fruits but live upon flies gnats and other winged insects The genus comprehends nu∣merous species which vary exceedingly in point of size from that of the Nightingale to that of the Shrike Some characters however are com∣mon to them all their bill is compressed broad at the base and almost triangular beset with bristles and the tip bent into a little hook in many of the middle species and more curved in all the large species the tail is of consider∣able length and only half covered by the wings Their bill is also scalloped near the point a property which they share with the Blackbird the Thrush and some other birds  Their disposition is in general shy and solitary and their notes are neither lively nor melodious Subsisting in the region of air they seldom leave the summits of the lofty mountains and are rarely seen on the ground Their habit of cling∣ing to the branches would seem to have increased  the growth of their hindtoe which in most of the Flycatchers is longer than the foretoe  The sultry tropical countries which teem with various insects are the favourite abodes of these birds  "The Flycatchers are in general common birds in hot coun∣tries The species are there more frequent and more numerous than in temperate countries and few occur in cold climates They feed only upon insects They are destructive creatures which in the hot and moist regions Nature has opposed to the excessive fecundity of the insects"  Voyage à la Nouvelle Guinée  par M SONNERAT  Two species only are found in Europe but we reckon eight in Africa and in the warm regions of Asia and thirty in America which are also the largest species and as in the New World the insect nations are the most numerous and the most formidable so Nature has provided a stronger body to prey upon themWe shall range them according to their size into three divisions the first are smaller than that of the Nightingale and are the  Flycatchers  pro∣perly so called the second are somewhat larger and may be termed  Moucherolles  the third are the  Tyrants  which are nearly as large if not larger than the Woodchat or Rufous Shrike and resemble in their shape and instinct the genus of the Shrikes which seems to connect the class of rapacious birds with the Flycatchers  The SPOTTED FLYCATCHER  Le GobeMouche  Buff  MuscicapaGrisola  Linn and Gmel  Grisola  Aldrov  Sylvia Fusca  Klein  Muscicapa  Briss  The Cobweb  Mort Northamp  First Species  This species being well known will serve as a term of comparisonIt is five inches eight lines in length its alar extent eight inches and a half the wings when closed reach to the middle of its tail which is two inches long its bill is flat broad at its base and eight lines long beset with bristles its whole plumage consists of these three colours gray white and blackish cinereous its throat is white its breast and the sides of its neck are spotted with faint illde∣fined brown the rest of the underpart of its body is whitish the upperpart of its head ap∣pears variegated with gray and brown all the higherpart of its body its tail and its wings are brown the quills and their coverts are lightly fringed with whitish  The spotted Flycatchers arrive in April and depart in September They live generally in the forests and prefer the folitude of the close shady spots and sometimes they are found in the  FIG THE SPOTTED FLYCATCHER OF LORRAIN  FIG THE COMMON SPOTTED FLYCATCHER  thick vineyards They have a melancholy air their disposition is wild inanimate and even stupid they place their nest entirely exposed either on the trees or the bushes No small bird is so incautious and none has instincts so unsettled The nests are not of an uniform construction some consist entirely of moss and others have a mixture of wool They con∣sume much time and labour upon the rude structure and sometimes we find it interwoven with thick roots and are surprized that so small an artificer could employ such materials They lay three or four eggs sometimes five which are covered with rufous spots  These birds procure the principal part of their subsistence while on the wing but seldom alight and then only by starts upon the ground and never run along it The male is not different from the female except that its face is more varie∣gated with brown and its belly is not so white They appear in France in the spring but the cold weather which sometimes prevails in the middle of that season is pernicious to them Lottinger ob∣serves that they almost all perished in the snows which fell in Lorraine in April and and that they were caught by the hand Every degree of cold that destroys the insects their only support must prove fatal to them accord∣ingly they leave our provinces before the frost sets in and they are never seen after the end of September Aldrovandus says that they  do not migrate but this must be understood in regard to Italy or of still warmer coun∣tries  Specific character of the Spotted Flycatcher  MuscicapaGrisola  "It is duskish below whitish its neck spotted longi∣tudinally its vent tawny"  The Flycatcher appears in Eng∣land in the spring and retires in August  "It is of all our summer birds" says Mr White "the most mute and the most familiar It builds in a vine or a sweetbriar against the wall of an house or in the hole of a wall or on the end of a beam or plate and often close to the post of a door where people are going in and out all day long This bird does not make the least pretension to song but uses a little inward wailing note when it thinks its young in danger from cats or other annoyances it breeds but once and retires early"  When its young are able to fly it retires with them to the thick woods and frolics among the high branches sinking and rising often perpendicularly in quest of flies which hum below  The COLLARED BLACK FLYCATCHER or the FLYCATCHER of LORRAINE  Muscicapa Atricapilla  var Linn  The Red Flycatcher  var Lath  Second Species  It appears to be better known in Lorraine and more common than in other parts It is rather smaller than the preceding being scarcely five inches long it has no other colours than white and black which are dispersed in distinct spots but its plumage notwithstanding varies more re∣markably than that of any other bird  The male appears to have four different garbs according to the seasons The first is that of the autumn or winter when the plumage is the same with that of the female which is not sub∣ject to such changes The second is worn when these birds arrive in Provence or Italy and is then exactly like that of the Epicurean Warbler The third is what they assume shortly after their appearance and may be termed the spring attire  "I fed one this spring three or four days Every person admired it though one of its finest ornaments the collar was wanting The white and black of its plumage were of the bright∣est tints"  Letter of  M LOTTINGER th  April    This is only the intermediate gradation to the fourth state which is that of summer and which as Lottinger observes may be properly termed its  marriage suit  because it as∣sumes this at pairing and lays it aside after the breeding is over The bird is then in its full beauty a white collar three lines broad encircles its neck which is of the finest black its head is of the same colour except the front and the face which are bright white its back and its tail are stained with the black of the head its rump is variegated with black and white a white streak of a line in breadth borders for some way the outermost quills of the tail the wings consisting of seventeen quills are of a deep chesnut the third and the four fol∣lowing are tipt with a much lighter brown which when the wings are closed has a very fine effect all the quills the two first excepted  have a white spot on the outer edge which en∣larges the nearer it is to the body so that the outeredge of the last quill is entirely white the throat the breast and the belly are white the bill and the legs black There is a remarkable lustre and gloss spread over the whole of the plumage but these beauties are gone before the beginning of July The colours grow dilute and dusky the collar first disappears and the rest soon becomes stained and obscure and the male is no longer distinguishable from the female  "I have frequently met with birdcatchers" says Lottinger "who spread the nets on the springs in places where they breed and though it was only in July they told me that they caught numbers of females but not a single male"  so entirely was the external distinction of sex obliterated That naturalist has not described so fully the vernal plumage with which they enter into the southern provinces However Aldrovandus seems to indicate the change of this Flycatcher which he has well described in ano∣ther place  He describes its collar the white spot on its wing he com∣mends its beauty It is known he says by the fowlers of Bo∣logna under the name of  PegliaMosehe  when ranging it again with the Be∣cafigos he tells us of his having surprized it at the very instant of its transformation being then nei∣ther an  Epicurean Warbler  nor a  BlackCap  Al∣ready he subjoins the collar was become white there was a white spot on the front  white on the tail and the wings the underpart of the body white and the rest black These properties sufficiently discriminate the Collared Black Flycatcher  This bird arrives in Lorraine about the mid∣dle of April It lives in the forests those espe∣cially which consist of tall trees and breeds in the holes of the trunks sometimes pretty deep and at a considerable height above the surface of the ground Its nest is formed of small stalks of grass and a little moss which covers the bot∣tom of the cavity It lays six eggs After the young are hatched the parents frequently go in and out carrying supplies of food and this care of their infant brood often betrays the re∣treat which would otherwise be difficult to dis∣cover  They subsist only upon flies and other wing∣ed insects They are never seen on the ground and for the most part they keep very high flut∣tering from tree to tree They have no song but only an exceeding shrill plaintive accent which turns upon the sharp note  crrî crrî  They appear sad and gloomy but their attach∣ment to their offspring inspires activity and even courage  Lorraine is not the only province in France where the Collared Black Flycatcher is found Hebert has informed us that one was seen in Brie but where it is little known because it is wild and transitory We ourselves found one  of these Flycatchers on the tenth of May in a small park near Montbard in Burgundy and it was in the same state of plumage as that described by Brisson Of the great coverts which he says are tipt with white those only which were next the body were such and the more remote were brown the inferior coverts alone of the tail were white the superior ones were blackishbrown the rump was dull pearl∣gray the nape of the neck where the collar was situated was lighter than the head and the back the middle quills of the wings were near the tip of the same brown as the great quills the tongue appears to be indented at the tip broad for the size of the bird but proportioned to the breadth of the bottom of the bill the intestinal tube was eight or nine inches long the gizzard muscular preceded by a dilatation of the  oesophagus  there were some marks of a  coecum  and no gallbladder The bird was a male and the testicles seemed to be a line in diameter it weighed three gros  In this species of Flycatchers the ends of the wings meet and stretch beyond the middle of the tail which is the reverse of what generally takes place in the genusThere are several inaccuracies in the figures given of it in the  Planches Enluminées  This pensive bird enjoys a quiet peaceful life protected by solitude It avoids the cold season and shifts the scene to the genial climes of the  south there to renew its loves They are found however pretty far north since they inhabit Sweden  Fauna Suecica  There are two species from the Cape of Good Hope which seem to be the same with that of Lorraine the first being dis∣tinguished only by a rusty spot on the breast and the second is only the female The differ∣ence of appearance is very slight if we estimate the influence of so distant a climate  The UNDULATED FLYCATCHER  Le GobeMouche de l'Ile de France  Buff  Muscicapa Undulata  Gmel  Third Species  We have in our cabinet two Flycatchers sent from the Isle of France the one rather black than brown and the other simply brown Both are smaller and especially shorter than the Eu∣ropean Flycatchers In the first the head is blackishbrown and the wings rustybrown the rest of the plumage is a mixture of whitish and of a brown like that of the head and wings disposed in small waves or small spots without much regularityThe second appears to be only the female of the first In fact the differ∣ences are too slight to constitute two species for the size the sigure the colours and almost  the shades are similar The second has indeed more white mixed with rusty on the breast and belly the browngray on the head and body is more dilute but the colours of the female are lighter in all the species of birds  Specific character of the  Muscicapa Undulata  "It is waved with whitish and brown its head partly blackish its wings dusky rufous"  The SENEGAL FLYCATCHER  Le GobeMouche à Eandeau Blanc du Senegal  Buff  Muscicapa Senegalensis  Linn and Gmel  Fourth Species  Under this appellation we shall comprehend the two birds figured in the  Planches Enluminées  by the names of  Rufousbreasted Flycatcher of Senegal  and  Blackbrcasted Flycatcher of Senegal  These handsome birds may be described toge∣ther they are of the same size and are natives of the same climate and the distribution of their colour is similar in both It is probable that they are the male and female of the same species The white line which passes upon the eye and encircles the head with a sort of little diadem is not so entire or distinct in any other of the ge∣nus The first is the smaller being only three inches and a half long a rufous spot covers the top of the head which is surrounded by the  white ring from the exterior angle of the eye an oval black spot extends which is bounded above by the ring and stretches into a point near the tip of the bill the throat is white a light rufous spot marks the breast the back is lightgray spread upon white the tail and the wings are blackish A white line extends obliquely on their middle coverts and the same coverts are edged with scales of the rufous colour of the breast A glossy transparency is spread over all the plumage of this bird still lighter and more vivid on that of the other which is simpler in its colours consisting of a mixture of light gray of white and of black and is not inferior in point of beauty the white bar passes upon the eyes a horseshoe of the same colour rises pointed under the bill and is cut square on the breast which is distinguished by a black belt the top of the neck is black which mingling with the white of the back melts into gray the quills are black fringed with white and the white line of the coverts opens into festoons the shoulders are black but there is a little fringed white interwoven with all this black and through all the white of the plumage small black shades are interspersed which are so light and transparent that this little bird is more beautiful than many which are deco∣rated with a profusion of rich and vivid tints  Specific character of the  Muscicapa Senegalensis  "It is variegated its eyebrows are white the outermost tailquills are white one half of their length"  The BOURBON FLYCATCHER  Le GobeMouche Huppé du Senegal  Buff  Muscicapa Borbonica  Gmel  Fifth Species  We shall consider the Crested Flycatcher of the island of Bourbon as only a variety of the Crested Flycatcher of Senegal and both as forming one species The island of Bourbon placed in the midst of a vast ocean and situated between the tropics enjoys an uniform tem∣perature which requires not periodical migra∣tions and when first visited by the European ships contained no land bird Those found in it at present have been carried thither by chance or design nor must it be regarded as the native seat of original species  We find also two Flycatchers of the isle of Bourbon which we shall barely mention convinced that they belong to some species on the continent of Africa The one is represented in the  Illumined Plates  N  o  Fig it is small and quite black except a little rufous which it has under its tail and notwithstanding the differ∣ence of colour we may suppose it to be a variety of the Cape Flycatchers which we have already referred to our Collared Black Flycatcher these differences of plumage being apparently no other than what we see it undergo itself and which the influence of a hotter climate must render more extensive and rapid especially as it is naturally disposed to change M Brisson indicates in the fol∣lowing terms the third Flycatcher of the isle of Bourbon to which he says the inhabitants give the name of  Tecteo  "Flycatcher above brown the edges of the quills tawny below tawny  male  Dirty white the tailquills deep brown their outer edges light brown  female  "  we shall therefore class  the bird discovered on the island with its analo∣gous one of the continent In fact the differ∣ences between them are not greater than those which often occur among individuals of this genus their figure their bulk and their prin∣cipal colours are the same in both the head is furnished with small feathers halfraised into a black crest with green and violet reflections this black descends in the Senegal Flycatcher like a square spot upon the breast and the fore∣part of the neck In that of Bourbon the black covers only the head with the eye and also the lowermandible but in other subjects it is spread also upon the top of the neck In both the underpart of the body is of a fine light slate∣gray and the upperside bay which is more vivid in that of Bourbon and deeper and ches∣nut in that of Senegal and this colour which extends equally over the whole of the tail and wings of the last is intersected by a little white in the other and assumes a deeper cast on the coverts which are also fringed with three lighter streaks The blackish colour of the quills has only a light rusty border on the outside and whitish on the inside of the webs The greatest difference occurs in the tail that of the Bour∣bon Flycatcher is short and square being only two inches and a half long the tail of the Sene∣gal Flycatcher is more than four inches and is tapered from the two middle quills which are the longest to the outer ones which are two  inches shorter This difference may be imputed to the effect of age season or of sex at any rate the classing of them together will excite a fuller investigation and an attention to the points of diserimination  The BROWNTHROATED SENEGAL FLYCATCHER  Muscicapa Melanoptera  Gmel  The Collared Flycatcher  Lath  Sixth Species  This Flycatcher was brought from Senegal by Adanson It is the same with what Brisson describes under the appellation of  Collared Sene∣gal Flycatcher  which is improper since neither the brown spot on the throat nor the black line that bounds it can be termed a collar A brown chesnut spot rises with a straight trans∣verse margin under the bill and the eyes and spreads on the throat but extends not to the breast being terminated at the lower part of the neck with a narrow black line which is very distinct as the breast with the rest of the lower∣part of the body is white the upper surface is of a fine bluish gray the tail blackish the out∣ermost quill is white on the outside the great coverts of the wings are white also the small ones blackish the quills are deep cinereous  fringed with white and the two next the body are white through their outer half the bill is broad and flat and beset with bristles at the angles  Specific character of the Collared Flycatcher  Muscicapa Melanoptera  GMEL  "It is cinereous below white the throat tawnybay a transverse black belt below the bill wings and tail black"  The AZURE FLYCATCHER  Le Petit Azur GobeMouche Bleu des Philippines  Buff  Muscicapa Coerulca  Gmel  Seventh Species  A beautiful azure covers the back the head and all the forepart of the body of this pretty Flycatcher except a black spot on the back of the head and another black spot on the breast the blue extends to the tail and gradually grows more dilute it tinges the small webs of the wingquills of which the rest are blackish and it also gives shades to the white of the ventral feathers  This bird is rather smaller taller and slen∣derer than the Spotted Flycatcher of Europe Total length five inches the bill seven or eight lines and not scalloped or hooked the tail two inches slightly tapered the blue has a glossy lustre  The WHISKERED FLYCATCHER  Le Barbichon de Cayenne  Buff  Muscicapa Barbata  Gmel  Eighth Species  In all the Flycatchers the bill is beset with bristles but in the present these are so long that they reach to the tip which is the reason of its epithet  whiskered  It is near five inches long its bill very broad at the base and very flat through its whole length the upper man∣dible projects a little beyond the lower all the upperside of the body is deep olivebrown except the top of the head which is covered by orange feathers partly concealed by the other feathers the underside of the body is greenishyellow which on the rump runs into a fine yellow  The female is somewhat larger than the male all the upperside of its body is blackishbrown mixed with a slight tint of greenish not so con∣spicuous as in the male the yellow of the top of the head forms only an oblong spot which is partly hid by the feathers of the general colour the throat and the top of the neck are whitish the feathers of the rest of the neck of the breast and of the undersurface of the wings have their middle brown and the rest yellowish  the belly and the undersurface of the tail are entirely of a pale yellow the bill is not so broad as in the male and has only a few short bristles on each side  The notes of the Whiskered Flycatcher are not sharp it whistles gently the sound  pipi  the male and female generally keep together The incautious manner in which the Flycatchers place their nest is remarkable in this species it does not seek the leafy boughs but builds on the most naked and exposed branches The nest is the more easily detected as it is exceedingly large being twelve inches high and more than five in diameter and entirely composed of moss it is closed above and has a narrow aperture in the side three inches from the top We owe our information to M de Manoncour  Specific character of the Whiskered Flycatcher  Muscicapa Barbata  GMEL  "It is olivebrown below greenishyellow its top orange its rump yellow"  The BROWN FLYCATCHER  Le GobeMouche Brun de Cayenne  Buff  Muscicapa Fuliginosa  Gmel  Ninth Species  The Brown Flycatcher is scarcely four inches long the feathers of its head and back are blackishbrown edged with fulvous brown the  fulvous is deeper and predominates on the quills of the wing and the black on those of the tail which have a whitish fringe all the underside of the body is whitish except a fulvous tint on the breast the tail is square and half covered by the wings the bill is sharp with small bris∣tles at its rootsuch are the distinguishing fea∣tures of this little bird Its species seems how∣ever to admit a variety if the differences which we perceived in another subject are not to be im∣puted to age or sex The dusky ground of the plumage in this last bird had a yellowish tint under the belly and an olivebrown on the breast the head and back had a slight cast of a deep olivegreen and on the great quills of the wings were some lighter streaks but the small coverts were dyed with a pale light roseyel∣low  Specific character of the Brown Flycatcher  Muscicapa Fuliginosa  GMEL  "It is dark brown the margin of its feathers yellowishbrown below whitish the margin of its equal tailquills and of its wingquills whitish"  The RUFOUS FLYCATCHER  Le GobeMouche Roux a Poitrine Orangée de Cayenne  Buff  Muscicapa Rufescens  Gmel  Tenth Species  The Rufous Flycatcher is found in Guiana in the skirts of the woods and the margins of the savannas it is easily distinguished its breast being orange and the rest of its body rufous its length is four inches nine lines its bill is very flat and broad at the base the head and the higherpart of the neck is greenish∣brown the back is rufous stained also with greenishbrown the tail is entirely rufous the black of the wingquills does not appear when they are closed except at the point their small webs being rufous instead of the orange spot on the breast white or whitish covers the underpart of the body There is only one specimen in the King's cabinet  Specific character of the Rufous Flycatcher  Muscicapa Rufescens  GMEL  "It is of a glossy tawny below white its wingquills black a brown dash on its top"  The LEMON FLYCATCHER OF LOUISIANA  Buff  Eleventh Species  This Flycatcher may be compared for its size and colour to the Yellow Wagtail Its breast and belly are covered with a fine lemoncolour which is still brighter on the forehead and the cheeks the rest of the head and neck are enveloped with a fine black which extends below the bill and forms a round horseshoe on the breast a greenishgray covers on the back and shoulders the cinereous ground of the plumage and ap∣pears in lines on the small webs of the great wingquills The vivacity and elegance of its colours the glossy black conspicuous on its light yellow ground the uniform tint of its greenish robe conspire to render this bird one of the handsomest of the genus  The REDEYED FLYCATCHER  Le Gobe Mouche Olive de la Caroline de la Jamaique  Buff  Muscicapa Olivacea  Linn and Gmel  Muscicapa Jamaicensis  Briss  The Olivecoloured Flycatcher  Edw  Twelfth Species  This consists of two kinds of varieties the one described by Edwards the other by Catesby  The first is of the same bulk and proportions as those of the European Flycatchers The upperpart of the head and body is olivebrown a white fillet rises above the eyes the groundcolour of the quills is ashbrown and they are fringed with olive for a considerable part of their lengthThe second kind is described by Catesby under the name of the  Redeyed Flycatcher  its colours are darker than those of the former It breeds in Carolina and re∣moves to Jamaica in winter but Sir Hans Sloane makes no mention of it Brown how∣ever reckons it one of the migratory Jamaica birds It has not a great extent of notes he tells us but its tones are full and mellowThis property must be peculiar to it for all the other Flycatchers utter shrill broken sounds  Specific character of the Redeyed Flycatcher  Muscicapa Olivacea  LINN  "It is olive below whiter its eyebrows white its eyes red"  In Jamaica it is called on account of its note  Whip Tom Kelly  It makes a pendulous nest formed with wool and cotton lined with hair and withered grass and bound together by a thready moss It lays five eggs white and thinly strewed with rufous spots  The MARTINICO FLYCATCHER  Le GobeMouche Huppé de la Martinique  Buff  Muscicapa Martinica  Linn and Gmel  Muscicapa Martinicana Cristata  Briss  Thirteenth Species  A fine brown which is deeper on the tail covers all the upperpart of the body of this bird as far as the head whose small feathers tinged with some streaks of a more vivid rufousbrown are half erect forming a tuft on the crown under the bill is a little white which soon gives place to a light slategray that covers the forepart of the neck the breast and the stomach the same white appears again on the belly The quilis of the wings are blackish∣brown fringed with white their coverts which are fringed with the same enter by degrees into the rufous tint of the shoulders the tail is somewhat tapered its thirdpart hid by the wings and is two inches long The bird is five inches and a half  Specific character of the  Muscicapa Martinica  "Its head is crested its body brown below cinereous the exterior margin of its wingquills whitish"  The BLACKCAP FLYCATCHER  Le GobeMouche Noirâtre de la Caroline  Buff  Muscicapa Fusca  Gmel  Muscicapa Carolinensis Fusca  Briss  The Blackheaded Flycatcher  Penn  Fourteenth Species  This bird is nearly as large as the Nightin∣gale its plumage from the head to the tail is of an uniform dull brown its breast and belly are white with a shade of yellowishgreen its thighs and legs are black the head of the male is of a deeper black than that of the female and this is the only difference between them They breed in Carolina according to Catesby and migrate from thence on the approach of win∣ter  Specific character of the  Muscicapa Fusca  "It is brown below ochrywhite its bill its top and its legs black"  The BLACK and WHITE FLYCATCHER  Le Gillit  ou  GobeMouce Pie de Cayenne  Briss  Muscicapa Bicolor  Gmel  Fifteenth Species  This bird which is called  Gillit  in its native country Guiana is of an uniform white on the  head the throat and all the underpart of the body The rump the tail and the wings are black and the small quills of these edged with white A black spot rises behind the head and stretches to the neck where it is bounded by a white cap which makes a circle on the backThe length is four inches and a half and the plumage of the female is entirely of a light uniform gray It is found in the over∣flowed savannas  The  White Bellied Flycatcher of Cayenne  N  o  fig  Pl Enl  hardly differs at all from the  Gillit  and we shall not separate them  We shall also class with it the  White and Black Flycatcher  of Edwards from Surinam of which the colours are the same except the brown on the wings and black on the crown of the head differences which are not specific  The CINEREOUS FLYCATCHER  Le GobeMouche Brun de la Caroline  Buff  Muscicapa Virens  Linn and Gmel  Muscicapa Carolinensis Cinera  Briss  Sixteenth Species  This is called by Catesby  The Little Brown Flycatcher  Its figure and size are the same as  those of his Olive Flycatcher with red eyes and legs and we should have ranged them together had not that accurate observer distinguished them A dull brown tint which covers uniformly all the upperpart is intersected by the rustybrown of the feathers of the wings and tail the underpart of the body is dirty white with a shade of yellow the thighs and legs are black the bill is flat broad and a little hooked at the point and eight lines in length the tail is two inches the whole length of the bird five inches eight lines it weighs only three grosThis is all that Catesby informs us and from him the rest have borrowed their descriptions  Specific character of the  Muscicapa Virens  "It is greenishbrown below yellow its eyebrows white"  The ACTIVE FLYCATCHER  Le GobeMouche de Cayenne  Buff  Muscicapa Agilis  Gmel  Seventeenth Species  This Flycatcher is not larger than the Yellow Wren of Europe its plumage is almost the same being cinereous and dirty white in both only this little bird has a greater mixture of greenish The flatness of its bill indicates its relation to the Flycatchers Our Wrens however have the same instincts and feed upon  the various sorts of flies in summer they con∣tinually circle in search of the winged insects and in winter they attack their chrysalids and pierce the horny shell  The total length four inches and a half the bill seven lines the tail twenty lines and pro∣jects fifteen lines beyond the wings  Specific character of the  Muscicapa Agilis  "It is olive∣brown below partly whitish the quills of its wings and tail black and olivebrown at their margin"  The STREAKED FLYCATCHER  Le Gobe Mouche Tacheté de Cayenne  Buff  Muscicapa Variegata  Gmel  Eighteenth Species  This Streaked Flycatcher is nearly of the same size as the Active Flycatcher which is also a native of Cayenne Dirty white with a cast of greenish on the wing and some distincter spots of yellowish white with ashbrown on the head and neck and blackish cinereous on the wings form the confused mottled plumage of this bird It has a small beard of whitish bristled feathers under the bill and a half crest of ashcoloured feathers mixed with yellow filaments on the crown of the head The bill is of the same size as that of the preceding and the tail  is of the same length but differs in its colours The Active Flycatcher appears also more nicely formed and more lively in its motions than the Streaked at least as far as we can judge from the stuffed specimens  The LITTLE BLACK AURORA FLY∣CATCHER OF AMERICA  MuscicapaRuticilla  Linn and Gmel  Muscicapa Americana  Briss  The Blackheaded Warbler  Lath and Penn  The Small American Redstart  Edw  The Small Black and Orangecoloured Bird  Ray  Nineteenth Species  We thus mark the two conspicuous colours of the plumage of this bird to which naturalists have hitherto given only the vague appellation of American Flycatcher It is hardly so large as the Yellow Wren A bright black is spread over the head the throat the back and the coverts a beautiful yellow aurora is pencilled on the white gray of the stomach and deepens under the wings it also appears in streaks between the quills of the wings and covers twothirds of those of the tail both which are tipped with black or blackishSuch are the colours of the male In the female the black is dilute blackish and the orange and blushcolour yellow Ed∣wards gives figures of both male and female  Catesby represents the bird also under the name of  Small American RedStart  but it is rather of a larger size which would make us presume that it is a variety  Specific character of the  MuscicapaRuticilla  "It is black its breast a spot on its wings and at the base of the tail∣quills yellow"  The ROUNDCRESTED FLYCATCHER  Le Rubin  ou  GobeMouche Rouge Huppé de la Riviere des Amazones  Buff  Muscicapa Coronata  Gmel  Twentieth Species  Of all the numerous family of Flycatchers this is the most brilliant Its slender delicate shape suits the lustre of its garb a crest con∣sisting of small divided feathers of fine crimson projects in rays on its head the same colour appears under its bill covers its throat breast belly and reaches the coverts of its tail an ashbrown intersected by some whitish waves on the edge of the coverts and even of the quills covers all the upperpart of the body and wings the bill is very flat and seven lines long the tail two inches and exceeds the wings by ten lines the whole length of the bird is five inches and a half Commerson calls it  Cardinal Titmouse  though it is neither a Cardinal nor a  Titmouse  We found the figure of these birds among the drawings brought by Commerson from the country of the Amazons In Spanish it is called  Putillas  as appears from a note at the bottom of the figure The female which is represented with the male has no crest all the beautiful tints of its plumage are fainter  It would be one of the handsomest birds for the cage but the nature of its food seems to place it beyond the dominion of man and to ensure it liberty or death  Specific character of the  Muscicapa Coronata  "It is brown the crest on its head roundish its temples and the underside of its body red"  The RUFOUS FLYCATCHER  Le GobeMouche de Cayenne  Buff  Muscicapa Rufescens  Gmel  The Twentyfirst Species  This Flycatcher which is five inches and a half long is nearly of the size of the Nightingale all the upperpart of its body is of a fine light rufous with a flame cast which extends over the small quills of the wings and these covering the great quills when the wings are closed have only a small black triangle formed by their ex∣tremities a brown spot covers the crown of the head all the anterior and the upperparts of the body are tipt with some slight shades of rufous the tail is square and spread the bill is broad short and strong and its point reflected and  partaking therefore both of the Flycatchers and of the Tyrants We are uncertain whether to refer it to Brisson's Rufous Flycatcher of Ca∣yenneIt is a discouraging circumstance that nomenclators have so often classed distinct ob∣jects by the same name however the  Rufous Flycatcher of Cayenne  is according to Brisson eight inches long and ours is only five and the difference in regard to colour will appear from comparing his description with what we have given  "Above tawny rufous below dilute rufous its head throat and neck deep cinereous the feathers on its throat and its lower∣neck edged with whitish its breast rump and tailquills bright rufous"  BRISSON  But there is no essential distinc∣tion between them except in regard to size and that difference cannot be imputed to age for if the smaller were supposed to be the younger the orange spot on the breast would be less vivid than in the adult  Specific character of the  Muscicapa Rufescens  "It is of a glossy tawny below white its tailquills black a brown dash on its top"  The YELLOWBELLIED FLYCATCHER  Le GobeMouche à Ventre Jaune  Buff  Muscicapa Caycnensis  Linn Gmel and Briss  Twentysecond Species  This beautiful Flycatcher inhabits the conti∣nent of America and the adjacent islands The  one figured in the  Planches Enluminécs  was brought from Cayenne we have received another from St Domingo under the name of  Crested Flycatcher of St Domingo  We are of opinion that these differ only by their sex that of St Domingo seems to be the male for the golden yellow of its crown is more vivid and more spread than in the other where the lighter tint scarce appears through the blackish feathers which cover that part of the head In other respects the two birds are similar They are rather smaller than the Nightingale being five inches and eight lines long the bill is eight lines and scarcely curved at the tip and the wings reach not to the middle the orange spot on the head is edged with a blackish ash∣colour a white bar crosses the face over the eyes below which a spot of the same colour appears that spreads and is lost in the rustybrown of the back this rustybrown covers the wings and the tail and becomes rather more dilute on the edge of the small webs of the quills a fine orangeyellow covers the breast and the belly which vivid colour distinguishes this bird from all the other Flycatchers Though the golden yellow feathers of the crown can be erected at pleasure as in the small European Wrens yet since they are usually reclined the bird is not properly  a Crested Flycatcher  Specific character of the  Muscicapa Cayenensis  "It is brown below yellow its eyebrows white its top somewhat orange"  The KING OF THE FLYCATCHERS  Le Roi des GobeMouches  Buff  Twentythird Species  This has been named  The King of the Fly∣catchers  on account of a beautiful crown placed transversely on its head whereas in all other birds the crests lie longitudinally It consists of four or five rows of small round feathers spread like a fan ten lines broad all of a bright bay co∣lour and terminated with a little black spangle so that it might be taken for a peacock's tail in miniature  This bird is also remarkably shaped and seems to combine the features of the Flycatchers of the  Moucherolles  and of the Tyrants It is scarcely larger than the European Flycatcher and has a disproportioned bill which is ten lines in length and very broad and flat beset with bristles that reach almost to its tip which is hooked The  tarsus  is short the toes slender the wing is not more than three inches nor the tail more than two It has a small white eyebrow its throat is yellow a blackish collar encircles its neck and joins that tinge which covers the back and changes on the wing into a deep fulvous brown The quills of the tail are light bay and the same colour though more dilute stains the rump and the belly the whitish colour of the stomach is  crossed by small blackish wavesThis bird is very rare only one specimen has been brought from Cayenne where even it seldom appears  The DWARFISH FLYCATCHERS  Les GobeMoucherons  Buff  Twentyfourth and Twentyfifth Species  Nature has proportioned these birds to their feeble prey a large American beetle might be a match for themWe have specimens of them in the King's cabinet and a short description will suffice  The first  This is the  Muscicapa Pygmaea  of Gmelin and the  Dwarf Flycatcher  of Latham  is the smallest of the Flycatchers it is less than the smallest of our Wrens and in its figure and even in its colours it is nearly the same Its plumage is olive without any yellow on the head but a few light shades of greenish appear on the lowerpart of its back and on its belly and small lines of yellowish white are traced on the blackish quills and on the coverts of the wingsIt is found in the warm parts of Ame∣rica  The second  This is the  Muscicapa Minuta  of Gmelin and the  Petty Fly∣catcher  of Latham  is still smaller than the first all the underpart of its body is light yellow verg∣ing  on straw colour it is hardly three inches long its head and the beginning of the neck are partly yellow partly black each yellow fea∣ther having in its middle a black streak which shews the two colours disposed in long and alter∣nate spots the feathers of the back the wings and their coverts are black cinereous and edged with greenish the tail is very short the wing still shorter the bill is slender and lengthened which gives this little Flycatcher a peculiar ap∣pearance  The useful destination of the Flycatchers will occur to the most superficial observer The insect tribes elude the interference of man and though despicable as individuals they often be∣come formidable by their numbers Instances are recorded of their multiplying to such an amazing degree as to darken the air of their devouring the whole vegetable productions and of their carrying in their train the accumulated ills of famine and pestilence Happily for man∣kind such calamities are rare and Nature has wisely provided the proper remedies Most birds search for insects' eggs many feed on their groveling  larvae  some live upon their crustaceous crysalids and the Flycatchers seize them after they escape from prison exulting on their wings Hence in autumn when these birds migrate into other climates the swarms of  gnats flies and beetles are in our latitudes more than usually numerous But in the tropi∣cal countries where heat and moisture conspire to ripen the exuberance of insect life the Flycatchers are more essential All Nature is ba∣lanced and the circle of generation and destruc∣tion is perpetual The philosopher contemplates with tender melancholy this cruel system of war he strives in vain to reconcile it with his ideas of benevolence of intention but he is forcibly struck with the nice adjustment of the various parts their mutual connexion and subordina∣tion and the unity of plan which pervades the whole  The MOUCHEROLLES  WE shall term those Moucherolles which are larger than the common Flycatchers but smaller than the Tyrants and to avoid confu∣sion we shall range them in two divisions cor∣responding to their size As the Moucherolles are intermediate between the Flycatchers and the Tyrants they participate of the nature of both  They are found in both continents but they are different species which occur in each The ocean that intervenes between the tropics is the great barrier which none but the palmipede birds from their facility in resting on the water can pass  In the hot climates Nature sports in the luxu∣riance of her productions Many species of birds such as the Widowbirds the Moucherolles and the Beeeaters which inhabit those sultry regions are furnished with tails of un∣common length this character distinguishes the Moucherolles from the Flycatchers from which they differ also in having their bill somewhat stronger and more hooked at the tip  THE FORKEDTAIL FLYCATCHER  The SAVANA  Le Savana  Buff  MuscicapaTyrannus  Linn and Gmel  The Forktail Flycatcher  Penn and Lath  First Species  This Moucherolle is nearly as large as the Tyrants and is figured in the  Planche Enlumi∣nées  under the appellation of  Forkedtail Tyrant of Cayenne  it is distinguished however by its bill which is more slender and not so much hooked as in the Tyrants It is called  the Widow  at Cayenne but this name is appropriated to another kind of birds which it resembles in nothing except the length of its tail It con∣stantly haunts the flooded savannas and for that reason we have termed it the  Savana  It is ob∣served to perch upon the adjacent trees and to alight every minute upon the clods or grassy tufts which rise above the surface of the water jerking its tail like the Wagtails It is as large as the Crested Lark the quills of its tail are black the two outermost nine inches long and forked the two following only three inches and a half and the rest gradually shorter so that the two midones are only an inchand thus though the bird is fourteen inches long mea∣suring from the point of the bill to the end of the tail the distance between its bill and its nails  is only six inches On the crown of its head is a yellow spot which is however wanting in many subjects these being probably females A short blackish square hood covers the back of its head beyond that the plumage is white which colour advances under the bill and spreads over all the anterior and underpart of the body the back is greenishgray and the wing brownThis bird is found on the banks of the river De la Plata and in the woods of  Montevideo  from whence it was brought by Commerson  Specific character of the  MuscicapaTyrannus  "Its tail is very long and forked its body black below white"  It is found as far north as Canada  The CRESTED MOUCHEROLLE  with Steelcoloured Head  MuscicapaParadisi  Linn and Gmel  The Pied Bird of Paradise  Edw  The Paradise Flycatcher  Lath  Second Species  This bird is found at the Cape of Good Hope Senegal and Madagascar Brisson describes it in three different places of his ornithology by the names of  the Crested Flycatcher of the Cape of Good Hope  "Crested Flycatcher  "Above dilute scarlet below white the breast cinereous white the head and the upperpart of the neck greenishblack the tailquills dilute purple"    the White Flycatcher of the Cape  of Good Hope  White Crested Flycatcher  "The head and upperpart of the neck greenishblack the tailquills white their outer edges and shafts black"  and  the Crested Flycatcher of Brazil  Crested Flycatcher  "Above dilute scarlet below white the head greenishblack the superior coverts of the wings goldcoloured the tailquills dilute scarlet"  These three are really the same the first and third being males and the second which is rather larger a female a property which though principally confined to the birds of prey obtains also in the Flycatcher the Moucherolles and the Tyrants  The male is seven inches long the female eight inches and onefourth this excess being almost entirely in the tail but its body is also somewhat thicker and of the size of a common Lark in both the head and the top of the neck are covered as far as the circular division in the middle with black shining with a green or bluish gloss whose lustre is like that of burn∣ished steel its head is decorated with a beautiful crest which falls loosely back its eyes are flamecoloured its bill is ten lines in length a little arched near the tip reddish and beset with pretty long bristles All the rest of the body of the female is white except the great quills through which the black appears at the tips of the wings when closed there are two rows of black streaks on the small quillfeathers and in the great coverts and the shafts of the tailquills are uniformly black throughout  In the male the breast below the black hood is bluishgray and the stomach and all the underpart of the body white a bright bay robe covers all the upperpart to the end of the tail which is oval shaped and regularly tapered the two middle quills being the largest and the others shortening two or three lines each the same is the case in the female  According to Adanson  Supplement de l'Encyclopedie tome i  this Moucherolle lodges among the mangrovetrees which grow in the solitary and unfrequented spots along the banks of the Niger and of the Gambra Seba places it in Brazil and ranges it with the birds of Paradise applying the Brazilian appellation  Acamacu  Brasilian Paradisebird or Crested Cuiriri Acamacu  but little can be relied upon the accuracy of that collector of Natural History who so often bestows names without discernment It is very unlikely that this bird could be found both in Africa and Brazil yet Brisson founds his classification upon the authority of Seba at the same time that he expresses a suspicion that Seba was mistaken Klein supposes it to be a  Crested Thrush  Turdus Cristatus  and Moehring a Jackdaw  Monedula  a strik∣ing instance of the confusion bred by a rage for nomenclature But we have still another Lin∣naeus imagines it to be a Raven but as it has a long tail he calls it the  Paradise Raven  Corvus Paradisi    Specific character of the  Muscicapa Paradisi  "Its head crested and black its body white its tail wedgeshaped its intermediate tailquills longest"  The VIRGINIAN MOUCHEROLLE  Muscicapa Carolinensis  Linn and Gmel  The Cat Flycatcher  Penn and Lath  Third Species  Catesby calls this the  Catbird  because its cry resembles the mewing of a cat It passes the summer in Virginia where it feeds upon insects it does not perch on large trees and frequents only the shrubs and bushes  It is a little larger  he tells us  than a Lark  Its size is therefore nearly the same as that of the Little Tyrant but the straightness of its bill distinguishes it from the Tyrants The plumage is dark being variously mixed with black and brown the upperside of its head is black and the upperside of its body of its wings and of its tail deep brown an even blackish on the tail its neck its breast and its belly are of a lighter brown a dull red cast appears on the lower coverts of its tail which is three inches long and consists of twelve equal quills and only twothirds of it covered by the wings the bill is ten lines and a half and the whole length of the bird is eight inchesIt breeds in Virginia and lays blue eggs it migrates on the approach of winter  Specific character of the Cat Flycatcher  Muscicapa Ca∣rolinensis  LINN  "It is brown below cinereous its head black its vent red"  It builds its nest with leaves and rushes and lines it with fibrous roots It is very courageous and will attack a crow  The BROWN MOUCHEROLLE of MARTINICO  Muscicapa Martinica  Gmel  Muscicapa Martinicana Cristata  Briss  Fourth Species  This Moucherolle has not a long tail like the preceding kinds in its size and figure it re∣sembles the largest of the Flycatchers It is dis∣tinguished from the Tyrants by the shape of its bill which is not so much hooked as the bill of the smallest Tyrants and more slender it is however eight lines long and the bird it∣self six inches and a half A deep brown of a pretty uniform tinge covers the upperpart of the body the head the wings and the tail the under surface of the body is undulated with transverse waves of rufous brown a few reddish feathers form the inferior coverts of the tail which is square and the edges of its outerquills are fringed with white lines  Specific character of the  Muscicapa Martinica  "Its head is crested its body brown below cinereous the outer margin of its wingquills whitish"  The FORKEDTAIL MOUCHEROLLE of MEXICO  Buff  Muscicapa Forficata  Gmel  The Swallowtailed Flycatcher  Lath  Fifth Species  It is larger than the Lark its whole length is ten inches of which its tail measures five its eyes are red its bill eight lines long flat and rather slender its head and back are covered with a very light gray mixed with a dilute reddish the red colour below the wings extends also on the sides and tinges the white that is spread over the whole of the underside of the body the small coverts are ashcoloured and edged with scaly white lines the great coverts which are blackish are similarly fringed the great quills of the wings are entirely black and sur∣rounded with rustygray the outermost quills of the tail are the longest and are forked like the Swallow's tail the other quills diverge less and gradually shorten so that the middle one is only two inches long they are all of a glossy black and fringed with rustygray the outer webs of the largest quills on each side appear white almost their whole length Some speci∣mens have the tail longer than that sent from Mexico by M de Boynes then Secretary for the Marine Department  The MOUCHEROLLE of the PHILIPPINES  Muscicapa Philippensis  Gmel  Sixth Species  It is as large as the Nightingale all the upperpart of its body is browngray all the underpart of the wings and tail are whitish from below the bill a white line stretches over the eyes and long diverging hairs appear at the corners of the bill Such are the obscure ambiguous fea∣tures of this bird A specimen is lodged in the King's Cabinet  The GREENCRESTED VIRGINIAN MOUCHEROLLE  Buff  Muscicapa Crinita  Linn and Gmel  The Crested Flycatcher  Penn Cat and Lath  Seventh Species  The length of the tail and bill of this bird marks its relation to the Moucherolles it is rather larger than the Flycatchers being eight inches long of which its tail forms the half its bill is flat beset with bristles and scarcely hooked at the tip and it measures twelve lines and a half the head is furnished with  small feathers reclined into a halfcrest the top of the neck and all the back dull green the breast and the forepart of the neck leadengray the belly of a fine yellow the wings brown and so are the great quills which are edged with bay those of the tail are the same This bird is not shaped like the Tyrants but appears to partake of their gloomy sullen temper It would seem says Catesby from its disagreeable screams to be always in enmity and continually at va∣riance with the other birds It breeds in Caro∣lina and Virginia and before winter it removes to hotter climates  Specific character of the Crested Flycatcher  Muscicapa Crinita  "Its head is crested its neck bluish its belly yel∣lowish its back greenish and the quills of its wings and tail rufous"  It builds its nest in the holes of trees employing for the materials hair and snakes skins  The SCHET of MADAGASCAR  Muscicapa Mutata  Linn and Gmel  The Mutable Flycatcher  Lath  Eighth Species  The name  Schet  is applied in Madagascar to a beautiful longtailed  Moucherolle  and two others are called  Schetall  and  SchetVouloulou  which seem to denote the Rufous Schet and the Variegated Schet and mark only two varieties of the same species Brisson reckons three but a few  differences in the colours are not sufficient to constitute distinct species where the shape the size and all the other proportions are the same  The Schets have the long form of the Wagtail they are rather larger measuring six inches and a half to the end of the true tail not to mention two feathers which extend almost five inches farther the bill is seven lines triangular very flat broad at the base beset with bristles at the corners and with hardly any perceptible curve at the point a beautiful black∣ishgreen crest with the lustre of burnished steel is bent smooth back and covers the head the iris is yellow and the eyelid blue  In the first variety the same dark colour that paints the crest encircles the neck and invests the back the great quills of the wings and of the tail of which the two long feathers mea∣sure seven inches and are white as are also the small quills of the wings and all the underpart of the body  In the  Schetall  the colour of the crest ap∣pears only on the great quills of the wings whose coverts are marked with broad white lines all the rest of the plumage is a bright gilded bay which Edwards terms a  fine shining cinnamon  which is spread equally over the tail and the two long projecting shafts these shafts are similar to those which are sent off from the tail in the Angola and Abyssinian Rollers only  in these birds they are the outermost while in the Madagascar Moucherolle they occupy the middle  The third variety or the  SchetVouloulou  has scarcely any difference from the preceding except that the two projecting feathers of the tail are whitish the rest of the plumage is baycoloured as in the  Schetall  In the  Schetall  which is preserved in the King's Cabinet these two feathers are six inches long in another specimen I found them to be eight inches and the outer webs edged with black threefourths of their length and the remainder white in a third these two long feathers were entirely wanting whether we must impute this to some accident to the age or to the moulting which Edwards thinks lasts six months in these birds  "I received this bird the  Schetall  from Ceylon M Bris∣son says that it comes from the Cape of Good Hope but the figure which he gives of it is surely imperfect as it has not the two feathers of the tail which are so remarkably large I believe it is natural to some birds which have these long tails to want them six months in the year which I have seen in some long∣tailed birds at London The White Crested Flycatcher de∣scribed by Brisson is certainly the male of the same species"  GLEANINGS    They are found not only in Madagascar but in Ceylon and at the Cape of Good Hope Knox gives a good description of them  "They are small birds not much exceeding Sparrows charming to the eye but good for nothing else Some of these birds have their bodies as white as snow the quills of their tail a foot long and their heads black like jet with a tuft or crest There are many others of the same kind the only difference con∣sisting in the colour which is reddishorange these birds have also a tuft of black feathers erect on the head I believe the one sort are the males and the others the females of the same species"  Hist of Ceylon  by Robert Knox  London      Edwards calls the third Schetall  the Pied Bird of Paradise  however Schets are totally differ∣ent from the Birds of Paradise  The TYRANTS  THE appellation of Tyrant applied to these birds must appear whimsical Ac∣cording to Belon the ancients termed the Little Crowned Wren  Tyrannus  This word in Greek signifies merely a king or prince  in the present case the name refers not only to this crown but also to their sanguinary disposition A sad proof of human misery that the idea of cruelty is ever conjoined with the emblem of power We should therefore have changed this mortify∣ing and absurd term but we found it too firmly established by naturalistsIt is not the first time that we have been compelled by the general usage to acquiesce in improper and incongruous epithets  These inhabitants of the New World are larger than the Flycatchers or Moucherolles they are stronger and more vicious their bill is larger and firmer their dispositions are darker and more audacious and in this respect they resemble the Shrikes to which they are analo∣gous also in the size of their body and the shape of their bill  The TITIRI or PIPIRI  LaniusTyrannus  Linn Gmel and Borousk  Muscicapa Tyrannus  Briss  Pica Americana Cristata  Frisch  Turdus Coronâ Rubrâ  Klein  The Tyrant Shrike  Lath  The First and Second Species  IT has the size and strength of the Great Cine∣reous Shrike it is eight inches long thirteen inches of alar extent its bill flat but thick and thirteen lines long bristled with mustachoes and straight to the tip where it is hooked its tongue is acute and cartilaginous the feathers on the crown of its head are yellow at the root and terminated with a blackish speckling which covers the rest when they are flat but when the bird swells with rage they become erect and the head then appears crowned with a broad tuft of the most beautiful yellow a light brown∣gray covers the back and on the sides of the neck it melts to the white slategray of the anterior and underpart of the body the brown quills of the wing and of the tail are edged with a rusty thread  The female has the yellow spot on the head though not so broad and its colours are more dilute or duller than those of the male A fe∣male measured at St Domingo by the Chevalier  THE GRAND TYRANT  Deshayes was an inch longer than the male and its other dimensions in proportion hence in general the smallest individuals in this species are the males  "All the Pipiris are not exactly of the same size or of the same plumage besides the difference remarked in all the kinds between the male and the female there is still another with respect to the bulk of individuals in this species This difference is often perceived and strikes even the most careless observers Probably the abun∣dance or scarcity of proper food is the cause of the diversity"  Note communicated by the  CHEVALIER DESHAYES    At Cayenne this Tyrant is called  Titiri  from the resemblance to its shrill noisy screams The male and female keep commonly together in the cleared spots of the forests they perch on the lofty trees and are very numerous in Guiana They breed in the hollow trunks or in the clefts of the branches below the shade of the most leafy bough If one attempts to plunder their young their natural audacity changes into in∣trepid fury they contend obstinately they dart upon the person pursue him and if in spite of all their exertions they are unable to rescue their dear offspring they fondly visit the cage and carry food  This bird though small appears to dread no sort of animal  "Instead of fleeing like the other birds" says Deshayes "or concealing itself from the rapacious tribes it attacks them with intrepidity and harasses them to such a degree that it generally succeeds in driving them off No animal dares to come near the  tree where it breeds It pursues to a consider∣able distance and with implacable obstinacy all that it conceives to be its enemies dogs espe∣cially and birds of prey  M Deshayes  "  It is not even inti∣midated at man so lately has his empire been established in those savage countries that it seems not conscious of his power  "I shot a young one which was only slightly wounded My little negro who ran after it was attacked by a Shrike of the same species which was probably the mother this bird fixed with such rancour on the boy's head that he had the utmost dif∣ficulty to get rid of it"  Note communicated by M de  Manoncour  In the moments of its fury it shuts its bill forcibly which occa∣sions a quick repeated cracking  In St Domingo this bird is named  Pipiri  which as well as  Titiri  expresses its usual cry or squall It is distinguished into two varieties or two contiguous species the first is the  Great Pipiri  of which we have just spoken and which is called in that country  The Blackheaded Pipiri  or  The Thickbilled Pipiri  the other is called  The Yellowheaded Pipiri  or  The Migratory Pipiri  and is smaller and weaker The upper∣part of the body in the last is gray fringed throughout with white but in the Great Pipiri it is fringed with rufous The disposition of the small Pipiris is also much milder and not so savage as the others These remain sequestered in the wilderness and are never met with ex∣cept in pairs while the small Pipiris appear often in troops and come near the settlements  They assemble in considerable flocks during the month of August and haunt those places which yield certain kinds of berries that attract the beetles and insects At that time these birds are very fat and are caught for the table  M Deshayes    Though they are called Migratory Pipiris it is not probable says Deshayes that they ever quit the island of St Domingo which is of suf∣ficient extent to admit local changes In fact they leave their usual haunts in certain seasons and follow the maturity of the fruits which feed their insect prey All their other habits are the same as those of the Great Pipiris both species are very numerous in St Domingo and few birds occur in more frequency  "They are seen in the forests in the abandoned grounds in the cultivated spots they like every situation yet the species of the Yellowheaded Pipiris which are the most numerous seem to prefer the settled parts In winter they come near the houses and as this season from the mildness of the climate corresponds to the spring in France it seems that the coolness which then pre∣vails inspires them with cheerfulness Never are they seen so noisy or so joyous as in the months of November and December They frolic with each other toy and caress"  Note communicated by M  Deshayes    They live upon caterpillars beetles butter∣flies and wasps They perch on the highest summit of trees and especially on the palms from thence they descry the insect as it roves in the air and the instant that they seize it they return again to their bough They seem most engaged from seven in the morning till ten  and again from four o'clock in the afternoon till six It is amusing to see them hunting their fugacious prey and pursuing their devious course but their lofty conspicuous station ex∣poses them perpetually to the eye of the fowler  No birds are so early awake as the Pipiris they are heard at the first appearance of dawn  "Except the Cock the Peacock and the Nightingale which sing during the night no bird is so early"  Note communicated by M  Fresnaye  formerly Counsellor at  PortauPrince  they pass the night on the summits of the tallest trees and hail the approach of the morning There is no stated season for their amours  "The Blackheaded Pipiris lay most undoubtedly in Decem∣ber We cannot affirm whether each female breeds every year nor whether these winter hatches which seem extraordinary be not occasioned by accidents and destined to repair the loss of hatches made in the proper season"  Note communicated by M  Deshayes  They breed says M Deshayes  in the heats of autumn and during the freshening air of winter  at St Domingo though spring is the most usual season they lay two or three eggs sometimes four which are whitish and spotted with brown Barrere reckons this bird a Beeeater and terms it  Petitric  Specific character of the  LaniusTyrannus  "It is cine∣reous below white its top black a longitudinal streak ful∣vous"  The TYRANT OF CAROLINA  LaniusTyrannus  var Linn and Gmel  Third Species  From the account which Catesby has given of this bird we do not hesitate to class it with the Pipiri of St Domingo since its disposition and its habits are the same  "The courage of this little bird is singular He pursues and puts to flight all kinds of birds that come near his station from the smallest to the largest none escaping his fury nor did I ever see any that dared to oppose him while flying for he does not offer to attack them when sitting I have seen one of them fix on the back of an Eagle and persecute him so that he has turned on his back into various postures in the air in order to get rid of him and at last was forced to alight on the top of the next tree from whence he dared not to move till the little Tyrant was tired or thought fit to leave himThis is the constant practice of the cock while the hen is breeding he sits on the top of a bush or small tree not far from her nest near which if any small birds approach he drives them away but the great ones as Crows Hawks Eagles he will not suffer to come within a quarter of a mile of him without attacking them They have only a chattering note which they utter with great vehemence all the time they are fightingWhen their young are flown they are as peaceable as other birds"  CATESBY  But it is distin∣guished by its red crown and the manner of placing its nest which is left entirely exposed in the shrubs or bushes whereas the Pipiri con∣ceals its nest or even lodges it in the holes of trees It is nearly of the same size as the Great Pipiri its bill seems less hooked Catesby says only  that it is broad flat and tapering  The red  spot on the upperpart of its head is very bril∣liant and is encircled with black feathers which conceal it when they are closedThis bird ap∣pears in Virginia and Carolina about the month of April there breeds and departs in the be∣ginning of winter  A bird sent to the King's cabinet under the name of  Louisiana Tyrant  appears to be exactly the same with the Carolina Tyrant of Catesby It is larger than the fifth species or Cayenne Tyrant and almost equal to the Great Pipiri of St Domingo An ashcolour almost black is spread over all the upperpart of the body from the crown of the head to the end of the tail which terminates in a small white bar shaped into festoons light whitish waves are inter∣mixed in the small quills of the wing some small streaks of deep orange inclined to red shine through the blackish quills on the top of the head the throat is of a pretty pure white which is shaded with black on the breast and again becomes snowy from the stomach as far as the tail  The Carolina Tyrant builds its nest with wool and moss and lines it with fibrous roots It lays five eggs which are white with rusty spots  The BENTAVEO or The CUIRIRI  LaniusPitangua  Linn and Gmel  Pitanguaguacu  Ray and Will  Tyrannus Brasiliensis  Briss  The Brasilian Shrike  Lath  Fourth Species  This Tyrant called  Bentaveo  at BuenosAyres whence it was brought by Commerson and  Pitanguaguacu  by the people of Brazil has been described by Marcgrave  "The Pitanguaguacu of the Brazilians Bemtere of the Portu∣guese is equal in bulk to the Stare has a bill thick broad pyra∣midal somewhat more than an inch long sharpened exteriorly its head compressed and broadish its neck short which it contracts when sitting Its body is nearly two inches and a half long its tail broadish and three inches long its legs and feet are brown Its head the upperpart of its neck the whole of its back its wings and its tail are of a blackish brown mixed with a very little greenish The lowerpart of its neck its breast and its lowerbelly have yellow feathers the upperpart however near the head has a little crown of white From below the throat to the origin of the bill is white It calls with a loud voice Some of these birds have a yellow spot on the top of the head some have it partly yellow they are called by the Brazilians Cuiriri In every other respect they are like the  PitanguaGuacu  "  MARC∣GRAVE  He makes it of the size of the Stare we will observe that it is thicker and more bulky and represents its bill as thick broad and pyramidal its edges sharp and more than an inch long its head bulky its neck short the head the top of its neck the whole of its back its wings and its tail of a blackish brown slightly shaded with dull green  its throat white and also the little bar on the eye the breast and belly yellow and the small quills of the wings fringed with rusty colour Marcgrave adds that some of these birds have an orange spot on the crown of the head and others a yellow one The Brazilians call these  Cuiriri  and in every other property they are similar to the  Pitanguaguacu  Seba applies the name  Cuiriri  to a species entirely different  Thus the Bentaveo of BuenosAyres and the Pitangua and Cuiriri of Brazil are the same and in their instincts similar to the Great Pipiri of St Domingo or the Titiri of Cayenne but the colours of the Bentaveo its bulk and the thickness of its bill the most obviously distin∣guish it  Specific character of the  LaniusPitangua  "It is black below white a yellow streak on its top a white belt on its eyes"  The CAYENNE TYRANT  Muscicapa Ferox  Gmel  Tyrannus Cayannensis  Briss  The Tyrant Flycatcher  Lath  Fifth Species  It is larger than the Redbacked Shrike of Eu∣rope In the specimen belonging to the King's cabinet all the upperpart of the body is ashgray deepening into black on the wings of  which some quills have a light white border the tail is of the same dark cast and is pretty broad and three inches long the whole bird measures seven inches and the bill ten lines a lighter gray covers the throat and receives a greenish tinge on the breast the bill is of a straw or light sulphur colour the small fea∣thers on the top and anterior part of the head are half erect and are painted with some strokes of citronyellow and aurorayellow the bill is flat beset with bristles and hooked at the point The female is not of so deep a brown  The Little Cayenne Tyrant of the  Planches Enluminèes  is rather smaller than the preceding and only a variety of it The one described by Brisson is also a variety  Specific character of the  Muscicapa Ferox  "It is brown its chin its throat and its breast cinereous its belly yellowish the greater quills of its wings olive at their margin"  The CAUDEC  Muscicapa Audax  Gmel  The Yellowcrowned Flycatcher  Lath  Sixth Species  This is the  Spotted Flycatcher of Cayenne  as represented in the  Planches Enluminées  but the hooked form of its bill its strength its size and its disposition entitle it to the name of Tyrant  It is called  Caudec  at Cayenne and is eight inches long the bill is scalloped at the edges near the hooked point is beset with bristles and is thirteen lines long Dark gray and white intermixed with some rusty lines on the wings compose its varied plumage white predominates on the under surface of the body where it is sprinkled with long blackish spots the blackish on the other hand is the prevailing colour on the back where the white forms only some edgings Two white lines run obliquely the one over the eyes the other below them small blackish feathers half conceal the yellow spot on the crown of the head The feathers of the tail which are black in the middle have broad borders of rufous the hind nail is the strongest of allThe  Caudec  haunts the creeks and perches on the low branches of trees feed∣ing probably upon aquatic insects It is less fre∣quent than the  Titiri  but has the same audacity and cruelty In the female the yellow spot is wanting on the head and in some males that spot is orange a difference which is perhaps owing to the age  The TYRANT OF LOUISIANA  Muscicapa Ludoviciana  Gmel  Seventh Species  This bird was sent from Louisiana to the Royal cabinet under the name of  Flycatcher  but ought to be ranged with the Tyrants It is as large as the Redbacked Shrike its bill is long flat beset with bristles and hooked its plumage is graybrown on the head and back light slatecolour on the throat yellowish on the belly and light rufous on the great coverts its wings cover only the third part of its tail which is a brown ashcolour shaded with a little rufous from the wings We are unacquainted with its instincts but these features sufficiently charac∣terize it and as it has the strength of the Pipiris it probably has also their habits  Specific character of the  Muscicapa Ludoviciana  "It is browncinereous below yellowish its throat slatecolour the quills of its wings and the edges of those of its tail rufous"  BIRDS RELATED TO THE FLYCATCHERS THE MOUCHEROLLES AND THE TYRANTS  The KINKIMANOU of MADAGASCAR  Muscicapa Cana  Gmel  Muscicapa Madagascarensis Cinerea Major  Briss  The Ashcoloured Flycatcher  Lath  THIS bird is distinguished from the Fly∣catchers by its size being almost as large as a Shrike but it resembles them in many other characters though a contiguous species there∣fore it cannot be included among them but evinces that our artificial divisions correspond not to the discriminating lines traced by Nature The KinkiManou is eight inches and a half long and is bulky its head is black and that colour extends like a round hood on the top of its neck and under its bill the upperpart of its body is cinereous and the underpart ashblue the bill is slightly hooked at the tip and not so strong as that of the Shrike nor even so strong as that of the Little Tyrant a few short bristles rise from the corner of the bill the legs are of a lead colour and thick and strong  The RED FLYCATCHER  I am of opinion that the  Red Flycatcher  of Catesby and the  Red Carolina Flycatcher  of Bris∣son cannot be referred to the genus of the Fly∣catchers or that of the Moucherolles for though its size the length of its tail and even its mode of life seem to be analogous its bill is thick large and yellowish which rather points its re∣lation to the Yellow Bunting We shall there∣fore regard it as an anomalous species It is thus described by Catesby  "It is about the bulk of a Sparrow it has large black eyes its bill is thick strong and yellowish the whole of the bird is of a fine red except the inner fringes of the wingquills which are brown but those fringes are not seen unless the wings are spread it is a bird of passage and leaves Carolina and Virginia in the winter the fe∣male is brown with a yellow shade"  Edwards also describes it and admits that it has the bill of the granivorous class only  longer  I think adds he that Catesby found that these birds feed upon flies since he gives the Latin appellation of  Muscicapa Rubra  The DRONGO  Lanius Forsicatus  Gmel  Muscicapa Madagascarensis Nigra Major Cristata  Briss  The Forktailed Shrike  Lath  Though nomenclators have classed this bird with the Flycatchers it appears to differ widely both from these and from the Moucherolles we have therefore separated it entirely and assigned it the name of  Drongo  which it receives in Madagascar Its characters are Its bulk being larger than the Blackbird and thicker The tuft on the origin of the bill Its bill is not so flat The tarsus and toes are very strong All its plumage is black varying with green directly under the root of the upper∣mandible some long and very narrow feathers rise erect to the height of an inch and eight lines they bend forward and make a very odd sort of crest the two outerquills of the tail project an inch and seven lines beyond the two middle ones the others are of an intermediate length and diverge which occasions the tail to be very forked Commerson assures us that the Drongo has a pleasant warble which he com∣pares to the song of the Nightingale and this makes a wide difference from the Tyrants which have all shrill cries and are besides natives of America This Drongo was first brought from  Madagascar by Poivre it has also come from the Cape of Good Hope and from China We have remarked that the crest is wanting in some specimens and we have no doubt that the bird sent to the Royal cabinet under the name of  the Forkedtail Flycatcher of China  belongs to this species and is perhaps a female the resem∣blance if we except the crest being entire be∣tween this Chinese bird and the Drongo  There is also a kind of Drongo found on the Malabar coast whence it was sent by Sonnerat it is rather larger than that of Madagascar or that of China its plumage is wholly black but its bill is stronger and thicker it has not the crest and what the most distinguishes it are the two long shafts which project from the ends of the two outerquills of the tail they are almost bare for six inches of their length and have webs near their extremities as at their origin We are unacquainted with the habits of this bird of Malabar but they are probably the same as those of the Drongo of Madagascar since the external characters are alike in both  Specific character of the  Lanius Forsicatus  "Its tail is forked it has an erect crest on its front its body is greenishblack"  The PIAUHAU  Buff  Muscicapa Rubricollis  Gmel  Muscicapa Cayanensis Nigra Major  Briss  The Purplethroated Flycatcher  Lath  The Piauhau is larger than any of the Tyrants and is therefore excluded from the Flycatchers indeed except in its bill it bears not the least analogy to these and seems to occupy a detached place in the order of Nature  It is eleven inches long and is larger than the Missel Thrush All its plumage is deep black except a deep purple spot that covers the throat in the male but is wanting in the female the wings when closed extend as far as the end of the tail the bill is sixteen lines long and eight broad at the base very flat and shaped almost like an isosceles triangle with a small hook at the point  These birds move in flocks and commonly precede the Toucans and always uttering the shrill cry  pihauhau  it is said that they feed upon fruits like the Toucans but probably they also eat the winged insects for the catch∣ing of which Nature seems to have fashioned their bill They are very lively and almost in continual motion They reside only in the woods like the Toucans and generally haunt the same spots  Brisson asks if the Jacapu of Marcgrave be not the same with the Piauhau  "Jacupu a bird of the bulk of a Lark its tail extended its legs short and black its nails sharp on the four toes its bill somewhat curved and black half an inch long its whole body is clothed with black shining feathers but under the throat spots of vermilion are mixed with this black"  We may answer that it is not The Jacapu of Marc∣grave has indeed a black plumage with only a purple or rather a red spot under its throat but at the same times  its tail is long its wing is short and its size is that of a Lark  these cha∣racters do not apply to the Piauhau  Specific character of the  Muscicapa Rubricollis  "It is black a great space on its chin and throat red"  Thus the KinkiManou and the Drongo of Madagascar the Red Flycatcher of Virginia and the Piahau of Cayenne are all contiguous species but essentially different from those of the Flycatchers the  Moucherolles  and the Tyrants  END OF THE FOURTH VOLUME
