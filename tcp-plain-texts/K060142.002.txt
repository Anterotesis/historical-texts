of the Counties of  Cornwall  and  Devon  and some Parts of  Somersetshire Wiltshire Dorsetshire Gloucestershire Buckinghamshire  and  Berkshire    SIR  _I NOW turned about to the East and as when I went West I kept to the Southern Coast of this long County of  Cornwall  and of  Devonshire  also so in going East I shall keep the North Shore The first Place of any Note we came to was  St Ive  's a pretty good Town and grown rich by the Fishing Trade it is situated on the Westside of a deep Bay called  St Ivesbay    from the Town This Bay is opposite on the Landside to  Mount  's  bay  which I spoke of in my last but it is filled up with Sands and here is but very little Trade in any thing else but  Cornish  Slate  It is a very pleasant View we have at  Madernhills  and the Plain by them in the Way from the  Land'send  to  St Ives  where we have a Prospect of the Ocean at the  Land'send  West of the  British  Chanel at  Mount'sbay  South and the  Bristol  Chanel or  Severn  Sea North At  St Ives  the Land between the Two Bays being not above Four or Five Miles over is so situated that upon the Hill neither of the Two Seas are above Three Miles off and very plain to be seen and so likewise in a clear Day are the Islands of  Scilly  tho' above Miles off  The Country from hence to  Padstow  is both fruitful and pleasant and several Houses of Gentlemen are seen as we pass the Sands also are very agreeable to the Eye and to travel upon among the Gentlemens Houses is  Lanhidrock  the Seat of the Earls of  Radnor  who are Barons of  Truro  and were so long before they obtained the Title of  Radnor  also a good House belonging to the antient Family of  Trefusis    The Hills are fruitful of Tin Copper and Lead all the Way on our Righthand the Product of which is carried all to the other Shore so that we shall have little to say of it here The chief Business on this Shore is the Herring Fishing the Herrings about  October  come driving up the  Severn  Sea and from the Coast of  Ireland  in prodigious Shoals and beat all upon this Coast as high as  Bidiford  and  Barnstable  in  Devonshire  and are caught in great Quantities by the Fishermen chiefly on Account of the Merchants of  Falmouth Foy Plymouth  and other Ports on the South  St Michael's  or  Modishole  a mean Portreeve Borough is not now remarkable but was of great Note in the  Saxon  Time and has still a Market weekly and a yearly Fair  We then came to  St Columb's  a little Markettown a Lordship belonging to the  Arundels  of  Wardour  so called to distinguish them from the  Arundels  of  Trerice  in this County which Family espousing the King's Side in the Civil Wars suffered much and was innobled in  Charles  II's Time The  Wardour  Family was likewise loyal and suffered in the same Cause  Near this Place is a Hill which has a Rampire on the Summit of it and a Causeway leading to it 'Tis an old  Danish  Camp and called  Castellum Danis    Padstow  is a large Town and stands on a very good Harbour for such Shipping as use the  Irish  Trade The Harbour is the Mouth of the River  Camel  or  Camal  which rising at  Camelford  runs down by  Bodmyn  to  Wadbridge  a little Town where a large Stone Bridge of about Eight Arches is built by the Contributions of the Country Gentlemen at the Motion and under the Direction of one  Nicolas Lovibond  Vicar of  Wadbridge  the Passage over the River before being very dangerous and having occasioned the Loss of some Lives as well as Goods  The Passage from this Town of  Padstow  to  Ireland  is said by Writers to be no more than Twentyfour Hours but this if ever done hat been so seldom that it ought not to be mentioned as generally the Case for I believe not one in Twentyfour Ships makes its Voyage in so few Hours and that they are oftener Five or Six Days in the Passage Here is a very antient Seat like a Castle of a Family of the Name of  Prideaux  the Chief of which in Queen  Elizabeth  's Time built this noble Seat there  Higher within the Land lies the Market and Borough Town of  Bodmyn  formerly one of the Coining Towns of Tin till it lost that Privilege to  Lestwithyel  However it still injoys several Advantages some of which are Tokens of its Antiquity It is pretty large and stands between two Hills in a good Air It had antiently several Churches of which now only one remains which belonged to the Priory and is at present the Parish Church A kind of Carnival is kept here yearly in  July  whither great Numbers of People resort  The Coinage Towns were in Queen  Elizabeth  's Time Four namely  Leskard  Lestwithyel  Truro  Helston  Since that in King  James  's Time was added  Pensance    Camelford  is a mean but antient Boroughtown Here the River  Camel  rises which takes its Name from the  British  Word  Cam i e  crooked It has not either Church or Chapel in it nor ever had It is only remarkable for two great Battles which were fought here one between King  Arthur  and his Nephew  Mordred  and the other between the  Britons  and  Saxons    The Borough of  Bossiney  otherwise called  Trevena  is but a small Village It is famous only for the splendid Ruins of an impregnable Castle built on the Rock which stood partly on the Continent and partly on an Island joined together by a Drawbridge The Castle was the Seat of the  British  Princes and since of the Dukes of  Cornwall  And 'tis said  Arthur  was born here and died in one of the abovementioned Battles near  Camelford    Launceston  which is a Corruption of the  British  Word  Lanstuphadon  i e  St Stephen  's Church is a Market and Boroughtown pretty neat and is  situate on a rising Ground at the Extremity of the County on the Borders of  Devonshire  great Part of it is very old ragged and decayed  When  Richard  Earl of  Cornwall  had the Government of this County this was a Frontier Town well walled about and fortified and had also a noble Castle which from its Strength was called  Castle Terrible  The Inhabitants for the Defence and Repair of it held formerly the Lands here by  Castleguard    Here the Lord  Hopton  's good Fortune failed him and he was forced by  Fairfax  to disband his Army  Not far from hence is  Hengestonhill  which produces a great Plenty of  Cornish  Diamonds The  Cornish Britons  joined the  Danes  here to drive out the  Saxons  from  Devonshire  but were totally defeated by  Egbert  in which 'tis conjectured gives the Name of  Hengist  to this Hill in Commemoration of their first Leader  Newport  is a little Village adjoining and was formerly Part of  Launceston  and yet sends Two Members to Parliament And indeed there are no less than Fortyfour and the Number of Electors are so few in many of the Places that an Administration of which Side soever it be as to Party has usually a great Reliance on the Elections in this County every new Parliament in order to obtain a Majority in the House of Commons For Fortyfour Members from hence and Fortyfive from another Part of the Island who generally go one way make no small Figure in a Question And in this Case it may not be improperly observed that the two Extremities of the Island let the other Parts go as they will are generally united in the same way of Thinking or at least of Acting in all Political Debates and are likely to be so in all Times to come  There is a fine Image or Figure of  Mary Magdalen  upon the Tower of the Church at  Launceston  to which the Papists fail not to pay Reverence as they pass by There is no Tin Copper or Lead found hereabouts as I could hear nor any Manufacture in the Place There are a pretty many Attorneys here who manage Business for the rest of their Fraternity at the Assizes As to Trade it has not much to boast of and yet there are People enough in it to excuse those who call it a populous Place There is a long Nook of the County runs North from this Place called the  Hundred of  Stratton in which there is one Markettown named  Stratton  but it has nothing in or about it worth remarking except only  Stowhouse  built by the Earl of  Bath  in the Reign of King  Charles  II and as to its Finishings within not inferior to any in  England  The Carvings especially those of the Chapel the grand Alcove and some of the best Rooms were done by the Hand of  Michael Chuke  and are not excelled by  Gibbon  himself The Landschape and Seapieces of which there were a great Number particularly in the great Stairs a Prospect of  Plymouth  containing Feet by were the Work of  Vandeist  The Situation of this stately Palace renders it a disagreeable Habitation for which Reason the Owners have disposed of the Materials and it is now  Nov  pulling to Pieces Near this Town Sir  Ralph Hopton  defeated the Parliament Forces under the Command of MajorGeneral  Chudleigh  and took him Prisoner for which he was made Baron  Stratton  'Tis said the Place where this Battle was fought produced a prodigious Crop of Barley of or Ears on a Stalk the next Year  Not far from  Bodmyn  is to be seen the Set of monumental Stones called  The Hurlers  which Dr  Stukeley  says are out of Doubt Remains of an antient  Druid  Temple Probably they are called by  this Name from the Game of Hurling practised in these Parts the Country People giving them that for want of a better and indeed it is said that they have a superstitious Notion that they were once Men who were transformed into Stones for playing at this Sport on a  Sunday  They are oblong rude unhewn Stones pitched on one End upon the Ground They stand on a Down in Three Circles the Centres whereof are in a right Line the middlemost Circle the greatest  Now I have mentioned the  Hurlers  I must take the Opportunity to describe the  Hurling Match  for which the  Cornish  Men are so particularly famous and which is one of their principal Recreations tho' barbarous enough A Silver Ball is generally the Prize on these Occasions The Match is made in different Manners for sometimes the Challenge is by Twenty or Thirty Men on a Side and no others are to interfere at other times when a great Number of People are assembled at a  Wake  or  ChurchAle  the Word is given out  That  Johns Wills  and  Toms  will oppose all other Names  or at other times  That  Eldest  or  Seconds  are against all  Younger Sons And so the Ball is thrown up and becomes the Property of that Party which carries it away to the Goal set for that Purpose  But another kind of  Hurling  is when an  Outball  as they call it is thrown up and these Matches are generally made by Two or more neighbouring Gentlemen who at a Day agreed on bring each of them the Men of Two Three or more Parishes and the Goals are then set perhaps Four or Five Miles distant at some Gentlemens Houses Towns or the like and here nothing is said about Matching in Number or otherwise but the Ball is thrown up and a bloody Skirmish generally ensues no Bushes Briers Bogs Mudpools Rivers or any other Impediments hinder their Course nor any  Friendship Relation or former Obligation in the least abates their Fury The Party prevailing generally present the Ball to the Gentlemen who brought them on as a Trophy and he in Return sets open his Cellardoors where they wash away the Blood from their Noses and apply a Balsam to their Bruises  The Wrestling in  Cornwall  is indeed a much more manly and generous Exercise and that Closure which they call the  Cornish Hug  has made them eminent in the Wrestling Rings all over  England  as the  Norfolk  and  Suffolk  Men are for their Dexterity at the Hand and Foot and throwing up the Heels of their Adversary without taking hold of him  Passing the River  Tamar  about Two Miles from  Launceston  we enter the great County of  Devon  and as it is in the most wild and barren Part of it and where formerly Tin Mines were found tho' now they are either quite exhausted or not to be worked without more Charge than Profit so we must expect it a little to resemble its neighbour County  The River  Tamar  here abounds with fresh Salmon which are so exceeding fat and good that they are esteemed in both Counties above the Fish of the same Kind found in other Places and the Quantity is so great as supplies the Country in abundance This is occasioned by the Mouth of the River being so very large and the Water so deep for Two Leagues before it opens into  Plymouth Sound  that the Fish have a secure Retreat in the salt Water for their Harbour and Shelter and from thence they shoot up into the fresh Water in vast Numbers to cast their Spawn  We ride but a few Miles in  Devonshire  before we find a different Face in several respects As More People than in  Cornwall  Larger Towns The People all busy and in full Imploy upon their Manufactures  At the uppermost and extreme Part of the County Northwest runs a large Promontory into the Sea beyond all the Land on either Side whether of  Devonshire  or of  Cornwall  This they would fain have called  Hercules  's  Promontory  but the honest Sailors and after them the plain Country People call it  Hartland Point  or  Hearty Point  from the Town of  Hartland  which stands just within the Shore and is situated on the utmost Edge of the County of  Devon  It is a Markettown of good Resort the People coming constantly to it out of  Cornwall  the Fisherboats of  Barnstable Bidiford  and the other Towns on the Coasts lying often under the  Lee  as they call it of these Rocks for Shelter from the Southwest or Southeast Winds at which time the Seamen go on Shore here and supply themselves with Provisions nor is the Town unconcerned in that gainful Fishingtrade which is carried on for the Herrings on this Coast  From this Point or Promontory the Land falling away for some Miles makes a Gulph or Bay which reaching to the Headland or Point of  Barnstable  Haven is called from thence  Barnstable  Bay Into this Bay or at the Westend of it the Rivers  Taw  and  Towridge  empty themselves at one Mouth and it is very particular that as Two Rivers join in One Chanel so here are Two great trading Towns in One Port a thing which as it is not usual so I cannot say is an Advantage to any of them for it naturally follows that they rival one another and lessen both whereas had they been joined together in one Town or were it possible to join them they would make the most considerable Town or City rather in all this Part of  England    These are the Towns of  Barnstable  and  Bidiford  the first the most antient the last the most flourishing the Harbour or River is in its Entrance the same to both and when they part  the  Towridge  turns to the Right or Southwest and the  Taw  to the Southeast yet they seem to be both so safe so easy in the Chanel so equally good with respect to Shipping and so equidistant from the Sea that neither Town complains of the Bounty of the Sea to them or their Situation by Land and yet of late Years the Town of  Bidiford  has flourished and the Town of  Barnstable  rather declined  Bidiford  is a clean wellbuilt Town the more antient Street which lies next the River is very pleasant where is the Bridge a very noble Quay and the Customhouse it is also very well built and populous and fronts the River for above three Quarters of a Mile But besides this there is a new spacious Street which runs North and South or rather Northwest and Southeast a great Length broad as the  HighStreet  of  Exeter  wellbuilt and inhabited with considerable and wealthy Merchants who traffick to most Parts of the World  Here as is to be seen in almost all the Markettowns of  Devonshire  is a very large and wellfinished Meetinghouse and by the Multitude of People which I saw come out of it I thought all the Town had gone thither and began to inquire for the Church but I found that also large spacious and filled with People of the best Fashion  The Trade of this Town as well as of all the Towns on this Coast being very much in Fish I observed that several Ships were imployed to go to  Liverpool  and up the River  Mersey  to  Warrington  to fetch the Rock Salt which is found in that County and of which I shall say more in my Remarks on those Parts to  Bidiford  and  Barnstable  and there dissolve it into Brine in the Seawater joining the Strength of two Bodies in one and then boil it up again into a new Salt as the  Dutch  do by that of the  French  and  Portuguese  This is justly called  Salt upon Salt  and with this they cure their Herrings  As this is a Trade which can be but of few Years standing because the Rock Salt itself has not been discovered in  England  many Years so the Difference in curing the Fish has been such that the Demand for them has considerably increased in foreign Markets  Here is a very fine Stone Bridge over the River built in the th Century on  Gothick  Arches all uniform and regular and very good Workmanship of the kind These Arches are indeed beautiful and stately but what a late Author says that one of them is so big that a Ship of Tons may sail under it is a Mistake no such thing being practicable either at  London  Bridge  Rochester  Bridge or even at  York  where the largest Arch in  England  is supposed to be  As  Bidiford  has a fine Bridge over the  Towridge  so  Barnstable  has a very noble one over the  Taw  and tho' not longer is counted larger and stronger than the other These two rival Towns are really very considerable both of them have a large Share in the Trade to  Ireland  and in the Herringfishery and in a Trade to the  British  Colonies in  America  if  Bidiford  cures more Fish  Barnstable  imports more Wine and other Merchandizes they are both established Ports for landing Wool from  Ireland  of which by itself  If  Bidiford  has a greater Number of Merchants  Barnstable  has a greater Commerce within Land by its great Market for  Irish  Wool and Yarn  c  with the Sergemarkets of  Tiverton  and  Exeter  who come up hither to buy So that in a word  Barnstable  tho' it has lost Ground to  Bidiford  yet take it in all its Trade completely is full as considerable as  Bidiford  only that perhaps it was formerly far superior to it and the other has risen up to be its Match  Barnstable  is a large wellbuilt Town seated among the Hills It is more populous than  Bidiford  but not better built and stands lower insomuch that at Highwater in Springtides it is in a manner surrounded with Water The Bridge was  built by the generous Benefaction of one  Stamford  a Citizen and Merchant of  London  who it seems was not a Native of the Place but by trading here to his Gain had Kindness enough for the Town to confer that valuable Benefit upon them It was formerly walled in and had a Castle and a Priory 'Tis governed by a Mayor and Twentyfour Burgesses whereof Two are Aldermen It has also an HighSteward and Recorder  The Bridge at  Bidiford  as above was likewise a Gift but was as they say done by Collections among the Clergy by Grant of Indulgences and the like Church Management However both the Towns are infinitely obliged to the Benefactors and we wish no worse Use had ever been made of Superstition  Behind  Bidiford  as we come from  Launceston  are several good Towns tho' I observed that the Country was wild and barren as  Tavistock Torrington  c  Tavistock  is situate on the  Tavy  among Springs and is a large Town pretty well built The Abbot of this Place sat in Parliament built a Church of Yards long spacious Cloisters and a Chapterhouse with Stalls which are all now destroy'd  The Town of  Torrington  is situated on the same River that  Bidiford  stands upon It has a large spacious Church with a Library in it and was for some time the Residence of  Margaret  the Mother of  Henry  VII  Another Town in this Part of the Country is  Okehampton  vulgarly  Okington  a good Market and Boroughtown governed by Eight principal Burgesses and as many Assistants it is a manufacturing Town as all the Towns this way now are and pretty rich but in the Records of Antiquity it appears to have been much more considerable than it is now having Knights Fees belonging to it  A little above  Barnstable  N E upon the Coast stands a noted Market and Porttown called  Ilfordcomb    a Place of good Trade populous and rich which is owing to its having a very good Harbour and Road for Ships which affords a safe Shelter for Vessels from  Ireland  when in bad Weather they cannot without the extremest Hazard run into the Mouth of the  Taw  which they call  Barnstable  Water and this is one Reason that the Merchants at  Barnstable  do much of their Business at this Port of  Ilfordcomb    The Harbour of this Town was maintain'd formerly at the private Expence of the Ancestors of Sir  Bourchier Wrey  Bart Lord of the Manor and the Quay or Pier of it contains in Length upwards of Feet and in Height upwards of Forty and the Warphouse Lighthouse Pilotboats and Tawboats belonging to the Port were at first founded and built and constantly repaired and maintained by that worthy Family without any Assistance but some small Acknowledgments paid to them as Lords of the Manor But by Length of Time and Violence of the Sea the Quay was very much sunk and impair'd the Warp and Warphouse by long Usage was gone to Decay and the Boats for Piloting and Towing were much out of Repair and the small Duties and Acknowlegements to Sir  Bourchier  sinking and being frequently unpaid to remedy all these Evils an Act passed  Anno    George  II for repairing and keeping in Repair and inlarging the Piers and Harbour and for the Support of the Light and Lighthouse the Warp and Warphouse and the Pilot and Towingboats as abovementioned so that by this means the Harbour of  Ilfordcomb  is likely to continue the useful and convenient Port it has been for so many Years past to the End of Time  Antiquity tells us long Stories of the  Danes  landing on this Coast of  Hubba  the  Danish  King being slain at  Kennith  Castle between this Place and the  Mouth of the  Taw  and  Towridge  and that the Place was called  Hubbestow  from his being buried there but I could not hear either of this Castle or Burialplace or so much as the Ruins of them  The Seacoast in this Country runs a little farther East by North but nothing of Moment is to be seen there except Fishingtowns and little Creeks on which are Two Markettowns  viz Combemerton  and  Porlock  till we came to  Minehead    Leaving the Coast in our Journey Southward we came to the great River  Ex  or  Isca  which rises in the Hills on the North Side of the County and like the  Tamar  begins within Four or Five Miles of the  Severn  Sea The Country it rises in is called  Exmore Camden  says it is a filthy barren Ground and indeed so it is but as soon as the  Ex  comes off from the Moors and hilly Country and descends into the lower Grounds we found an Alteration for then we saw  Devonshire  in its other Countenance cultivated populous and fruitful and continuing so till we came to  Tiverton    Next to  Exeter  this is the greatest manufactureing Town in the County and of all the inland Towns is likewise next to it in Wealth and Number of People it stands on the River  Ex  and has over it an old Stone Bridge with another over the little River  Loman  which immediately after falls into the  Ex  just below the Town Antiquity says before those Bridges were built there were two Fords here one thro' each River and that the Town was from thence called  Twyfordton  that is the Town upon the two Fords and so by abbreviating the Sounds  Twyforton  then  Tiverton    This Town has been a remarkable Sufferer by Fire for in the Year  April  it was consum'd on a sudden  Aug  it was again burnt down and  July  another dreadful Fire destroyed there of the best Houses  An Act passed on this sad Occasion  Anno  for the more easy rebuilding of the Town and determining Differences on that Account and it injoins that the newbuilt Houses shall be cover'd with Lead Slate or Tile and not Thatch that perilous Trades shall not be exercised in publick Streets that no Stacks of Hay Straw Corn  c  shall be erected at or near the publick Parts of the Town that FireEngines may be bought by the Guardians of the Poor that Houses may be demolished to stop any future Fire that the Streets and Passages of the Town may be inlarged and particular Houses pulled down for that Purpose with other useful Provisions  An Act also passed  Anno  for making a Chapel built by the Subscription of the Inhabitants of  Tiverton  a perpetual Cure and for providing a Maintenance for the Ministers who shall officiate in it for as the Preamble to the Act observes the Parish Church was not near capacious enough to receive the Inhabitants of the Parish The late Sir  William Wyndham  was a great Encourager and Promoter of this new Chapel at its first Erection  But the Beauty of  Tiverton  is the FreeSchool at the East Entrance into the Town a noble Building but a much nobler Foundation it was erected by one  Peter Blundel  a Clothier and a Lover of Learning who used the Saying of  William of Wickham  to the King when he founded the Royal School at  Winchester viz  "That if he was not himself a Scholar he would be the Occasion of making more Scholars than any Scholar in  England  "  to which End he founded this School He has endow'd it so liberally that I was told the Schoolmaster has at least Sixty Pounds  per Annum  besides a very good House to live in and the Advantage of Scholars not on the Foundation and that the Usher has in Proportion To this the generous Founder added Two Fellowships and Two Scholarships which he gave  the Maintenance for to  Sydney  College in  Cambridge  and One Fellowship and Two Scholarships to  Baliol  College in  Oxford  all which are appointed for the Scholars bred up in this School  As this is the chief Nursery of almost all the young Gentry of these Western Parts the Profit arising to the Master from Boarders and the liberal Benefactions of the Parents added to the Salary beforemention'd render it a Preferment suitable to a Man of the best Parts and Learning and as the Trustees are Gentlemen of great Honour it is generally disposed of to the most worthy Candidate Mr  Rayner  presided in it for many Years with very great Applause and dy'd about  This was written  Anno    Twelve Years ago To him succeeded Mr  Smith  after him Mr  Jones  next Mr  Wesley  once Usher of  Westminster  School as noted for his poetical Performances as his Brothers  John  and  Charles  are for their being at the Head of the new Sectarists who are called  Methodists  and he dying  Nov  is succeeded by Mr  Daddo  Thus hath it in Twelve Years time undergone Five different Regimens and if it be consider'd that every Change introduces some Difference in the Method of Teaching and Discipline it will be no Surprize that the School is something sunk in its former Reputation The present Master is Fellow of  Baliol  College  Oxford  had his Education here and from his great Abilities and good Oeconomy in which last respect a great Complaint lay against his Predecessor the School is like to retrieve its former flourishing Condition  The great Number of Gentlemens Sons sent hither for their Education as I have hinted is no small Advantage to the Town likewise and this join'd with the brisk Trade carried on here renders it so flourishing that notwithstanding the dreadful Calamity it underwent by the Fire in which  almost totally consumed it it is already very elegantly rebuilt and carries very few other Marks of this Devastation than the Magnificence and Beauty of the new Structures  As this is a manufacturing Country we found the People here all fully imploy'd and very few if any out of Work  From this Town there is little belonging to  Devonshire  but what has been spoken of except what lies in the Road to  Taunton  which we took next where we meet with the River  Columb  which rises also in the utmost Limits of the County towards  Somersetshire  and gives Name to so many Towns on its Banks that it leaves no room to doubt of its own Name being right such are  ColumbDavid  's  Ufcolumb Columbstock  and  Columbton  the last is a Markettown and they are all full of Manufacturers depending much on the Mastermanufacturers of  Tiverton    Before we leave  Devonshire  it will not be amiss to take Notice of  Lundy  Island which tho' Miles from  Devonshire  Northwestward is much mote remote from any other Continent 'Tis but Five Miles long and Two broad but so surrounded with inaccessible Rocks that there is but one small Entrance into it where Two Men can scarce go abreast Tho' this Island lies so far in the Sea it has the Advantage of several Springs of fresh Water  With the Town of  Tiverton  we leave the County of  Devon  and entering  Somersetshire  have really a View of a different Country from  Devonshire  for at  Wellington  the first Town we came to in  Somersetshire  tho' partly imployed in Manufactureing too we were immediately surrounded with Beggars to such a Degree that we had some Difficulty to keep them from under our Horses Heels I was  astonish'd at such a Sight in a Country where the People were so generally full of Work for in  Cornwall  where there are hardly any Manufacturers and abundance of Poor we never found any like this  Wellington  is a low dirty Place and is only remarkable for having been the Place of Residence of the Lord Chief Justice  Popham  in the Reigns of Q  Elizabeth  and King  James  I who was buried here They talk much of one  Salkeld  who was converted from Popery by King  James  I and made Minister of this Place He called himself in Compliment to the King  The Royal Convert  who in return complimented him with the Title of the  Learned Salkeld  which bythebye reflected no bad Compliment on himself for having converted a learned Man  The County of  Somerset  joins to the Northeast Part of  Devonshire  and takes its Name from the  British  Word  Gladyr Haf  which signifies SummerCountry and so the  Welsh  call it in their Language to this Day I touch'd only upon one Point of the County in my last as I went Westward The whole County is worth a more particular Account than can be given within the Space of a Letter  From  Wellington  we came to  Taunton  leaving  Blackdown Hills  on our Right and  Ilminster  behind them Southward a Markettown fam'd for its very good Church and a stately Monument erected in it to  Nicolas Wadham  and  Dorothy  his Wife Founders of  Wadham  College  Oxon    Near  Taunton  lies that rich Track of Ground vulgarly called  Tauntondean  This large wealthy and very populous Town takes its Name from the River  Tone  whereon it is situated One of the chief Manufacturers here told us That there was at that time so good a Trade in the Town that they had eleven hundred Looms going for the Weaving of Sagathies Duroys and such kind of Stuffs and  that not one of those Looms wanted Work he added That there was not a Child in the Town or in the Villages round it of above Five Years old but if it was not neglected by its Parents and untaught could earn its own Bread This was what I never met with in any Place in  England  except at  Colchester  in  Essex    The Election of Members here is by those whom they call PotWalloners that is to say Every Inhabitant whether Housekeeper or Lodger who dresses his own Victuals to make out which several Inmates or Lodgers will some little time before the Election bring out their Pots and make Fires in the Street and boil their Victuals in the Sight of their Neighbours that their Votes may not be called in Question  There are Two large Parish Churches in this Town and Two or Three Meetinghouses one of which is said to be the largest in the County The Inhabitants have been noted for Dissenters principally for  Taunton  was always counted a Seminary for such They suffer'd much in the Duke of  Monmouth  's Rebellion but paid King  James  home for the Cruelty exercised by  Jefferies  among them for when the Prince of  Orange  arriv'd the whole Town ran in to him with so universal a Joy that it was thought if he had wanted it he might have raised a little Army there and in the adjacent Part of the Country  There is a kind of College or Academy for the Dissenters in this Town and it is by far the greatest Town in all this Part of the Country  From  Taunton  we went North to take a View of the Coast  Exmore  of which mention was made above where the River  Ex  rises lies in the Way Part of it in this County and extending to the Sea Side it gives indeed but a melancholy View being a vast Track of barren and desolate Lands yet on the Coast there are some very good Seaports  Porlock  mentioned before on the utmost Extent of the County has but a small Harbour nor has it any thing of Trade  But  Minehead  the safest Harbour on this Side is a fine Port no Ship is so big but it may come in and no Weather so bad but the Ships are safe when they are in and they told me that in the great Storm  Anno  when the Ships were blown on Shore wreck'd and lost in every Harbour of the County they suffer'd little or no Damage in this  The Trade of this Town lies chiefly with  Ireland  and this was for many Years the chief Port in these Parts where Wool from  Ireland  was allowed to be imported but that Liberty is since inlarged to several other Ports by Act of Parliament  The Town is well built is full of rich Merchants and has some Trade also to  Virginia  and the  West Indies  They correspond much with the Merchants of  Barnstable  and  Bristol  in their foreign Trade What has greatly contributed to the Improvement of  Minehead  was an Act passed in the th and th Year of the late King  William  's Reign which was continued by an Act of the Tenth of the late Queen  Anne  For Recovering Securing and keeping in Repair the Harbour of  Minehead  And now so lately as in the Session another Act passed for further continuing the Terms and Powers of the Two former Acts for the bringing to Effect the same laudable Purposes in pursuance of which a new Head has been built the Beach clear'd and a great Progress made in the Piers and design'd Works  From hence the Coast bears back West to  Watchet  a small Port of late Years tho' formerly much more considerable for it had given Place to  Minehead  tho' now it is in a much better Condition than it used to be in and this it owes to Two Acts of Parliament one passed in the Sixth Year of the late Queen  Anne  for repairing of its Quay and Harbour  and the other in the Tenth But when the Works designed were near completed it was found that the Quay was built much too low and not extended to a sufficient Length to preserve the Town and the Ships and Vessels riding in the Harbour from the Violence of the Sea whereupon another Act passed in the Seventh of King  George  I for continuing the Duties laid by the former Acts and remedying the Inconveniencies beforementioned  It seems to me that the Town of  Minehead  rose out of the Decay of the Towns of  Porlock  and  Watchet    On this Coast are vast Quantities of Rock or rather Pebbles which the Sea at low Water leaves uncovered from whence the neighbouring Inhabitants fetch them on Shore to a higher Ground and burn them into Lime for dressing their Land but it is more especially useful in Building for that no Cement whatsoever is more lasting for  Jets d' Eau  Heads Piers and other Masonry that is to lie under Water in which Position it runs up to a Stone as hard as Marble and is scarce to be beaten abroad The Cliffs are stored with Alabaster which by the Wash of the Sea falls down and is convey'd from hence to  Bristol  and other Places on this Shore in great Quantity Neither should it be omitted that the Inhabitants burn great Quantities of Seaweed to supply the Glassmakers at  Bristol    Walking on the Beach near  Watchet  I discover'd among the large Gravel great Numbers of Stones fluted in Imitation of the Shells of Fishes of all kinds many of the flat kind are double and curiously tallied one in another which may by a violent Stroke be separated How to account for the vast Variety to be found here of this Sport of Nature I know not some I have seen as broad as a Pewterdish and again others no bigger than a Peppercorn but in all of them the Flutings are regular  some like the Escallop in Rays from a Centre others like the Perriwinkle in spiral Lines in these and all other Forms they lie here in great Plenty  Quantock  is a high Down in the Neighbourhood from whence besides the two little Islands called the  SteepHolmes  and the  FlatHolmes  and an extensive View of the Chanel I had a fair and distinct Prospect of the  Welsh  Coast for many Leagues in Length  From hence the winding Shore brings us to  Bridgwater  This is an antient and very considerable Town and Port it stands at the Mouth of the River  Parrat  or  Perrot  which comes from the South after having received the River  Tone  from the West which is made navigable up to within a few Miles of  Taunton  by a very fine new Chanel cut at the Expence of the People of  Taunton  and which by the Navigation of it is infinitely advantageous to that Town and well worth all their Expence first by bringing up Coals which are brought from  Swanzy  in  Wales  by Sea to  Bridgwater  and thence by Barges up this River to  Taunton  next for bringing all heavy Goods and Merchandizes from  Bristol  such as Iron Lead Oil Wine Hemp Flax Pitch Tar Grocery Dyestuffs and the like  This Town of  Bridgwater  is a populous tradeing Town wellbuilt and as well inhabited having many Families of good Fashion dwelling in it besides Merchants The famous Admiral  Blake  who under the Commonwealth so much exalted the Glory of the  English  maritime Force was a Native of this Town  This Town was regularly fortified in the late Civil Wars and sustained more than one Siege The Situation of it renders it easy to be fortified the River and Haven taking one chief Part of the Circumference Over the River they have a very good Bridge of Stone and the Tide rises here at  Highwater near Six Fathoms and sometimes flows in with such Impetuosity that it comes Two Fathoms deep at a time and when it does so unawares it often occasions great Damage to Ships driving them foul of one another and frequently oversets them This sudden Rage of the Tide is called the  Boar  and is frequent in all the Rivers of this Chanel especially in the  Severn  'tis also known in the North particularly in the  Trent  and the  Ouse  at their Entrance into the  Humber  at  Bristol  and in several other Places  There is in  Bridgwater  besides a very large Church a fine Meetinghouse built since the Toleration in which 'tis remarkable that they have an advanced Seat for the Mayor and Aldermen when any of the Magistrates shall be of their Communion as sometimes has happened Here also is a College or private Academy for the Dissenters to breed up their preaching Youth  From  Bridgwater  is a Road to  Bristol  which they call the  Lowerway  the  Upperway  which is the more frequented Road being over  Mendip Hills  This Lowerway is not always passable being subject to Floods and dangerous Inundations All this Part of the Country  viz  between  Bridgwater  and the Sea and on Northward upon the Coast lies low and is wholly imployed in feeding of Black Cattle which they bring out of the West Part of  Devon  and the neighbouring Borders of  Cornwall  where the finest are bred for as to those few bred in these low Lands they are very heavy sluggish and unshapely and the Beef soft and spongy such as they seldom or never drive to  London  Markets Indeed they breed a great many Colts but then they too must be transplanted very young into a dry healthy Soil for 'tis very difficult to find a Horse of their own Breed fit for any thing but a Drudge The Moors or Marshgrounds which are also imploy'd  in the same way extend themselves up the Rivers  Perrot  and  Ivil  into the Heart of the Country of which in its Place  This low Part between  Bridgwater  and  Bristol  suffered exceedingly in that terrible Inundation of the Sea which was occasioned by the great Storm  Anno  and the Countrypeople have set up Marks upon their Houses and Trees with this Note upon them  Thus high the Waters came in the great Storm Thus far the great Tide flowed up in the last violent Tempest  and the like  In one Place they shewed us where a Ship was driven up upon the Shore several hundred Yards from the ordinary Highwater Mark and left upon dry Land  As the low Part is thus imployed in grazing and feeding Cattle so all the rest of this large extended Country is imployed in the Woollen Manufacture and in the best and most profitable Part of it  viz  In  Taunton  The Serges Druggets  c  and several other kinds of Stuffs  In  Wells Shepton Glastenbury  c  Knitting of Stockens principally for the  Spanish  Trade  In  Bristol  and many Towns on the  Somersetshire  Side  Druggets Cantaloons and other Stuffs  In  Froom PhilipsNorton  and all the Country bordering upon  Wiltshire  Fine  Spanish  Medley Cloths especially on that Part of the County from  Wincanton  and  Meer  to  Warminster Bruton Castlecary Templecomb  down to  Gillingham  and  Shaftsbury  in  Dorsetshire    These fine  Spanish  Medley Cloths are the mix'd colour'd Cloths which all the Persons of Fashion in  England  wear There are vast Quantities of these exported to all Parts of  Europe  and it is so very considerable a Trade and of so vast an Advantage to  England  in maintaining and supporting so many poor Families and making so many rich ones that it is almost impossible to give a just Description of it The above Sketch however may serve as an Introduction to it But I shall add a little more concerning this County and upon my entering into the Northwest and West Parts of  Wiltshire  where the Centre of this Prodigy of a Trade is I shall sum it all up together and shew you the Extent of Land which it spreads itself upon and so give you some Idea as well of the vast Numbers of People who are sustained as of those who are inriched by it  But I must first go back a little while into  Somersetshire  The Northern Part of the County I did not visit in this Journey which as I hinted before is only a Return from my long Travel to the  Land'send  In omitting this Part I of course leave the two Cities of  Bristol  and  Bath  and that high Part of the County called  Mendiphill  to my next Western Journey which will include all the Counties due West from  London  for these now spoken of tho' ordinarily called the Westcountry are rather Northwest than West  In that Part of the Country which lies Southward of  Taunton  and  Bridgwater  is  Langport  a wellfrequented Markettown on the River  Parr  which is navigable for Barges to  Bristol  and occasions a good Trade here Eels are exceeding plentiful and cheap here Near this Place General  Fairfax  beat up the discontented  Goring  's Quarters and intirely defeated him  South Petherton  is a Markettown on the same River famous of old for the Place of King  Ina  but now of no other Note than an annual Fair which lasts Five Days in  June    From hence you come to  Yeovil  which I have already mentioned in a former Letter  Ivelchester  is a Borough Town and as its Ruins shew was formerly very large and incompass'd with a double Wall and had Four Churches It has now a good Bridge over the  Ivel  It was here that on the d of  May  Mrs  Elizabeth Branch  and her Daughter Miss  Betty Branch  were executed for a most barbarous Murder committed on the Body of a Servant Girl by one continued Series of Seven Hours beating and whipping which with the Behaviour of the Criminals was of so cruel and atrocious a Nature that it shocked the whole Kingdom The Particulars are too well known to need any farther Mention here had we Room which we have not  Somerton  is a good Markettown whence some say the Country takes its Name It was antiently very noted and had a strong Castle in which  John  King of  France  was Prisoner Here is a Fair which holds from  PalmSunday  to the Middle of  June    Milbourn  lies on the Edge of  Dorsetshire  and is very antient but has neither Market nor Fair  Camalet  is a noted Place situated on the highest Ground in this County on the Edge of  Dorsetshire  its vulgar Name is  Cadburycastle  from the Village of  NorthCadbury  wherein it stands Hereabouts rise the Rivers of  Somersetshire  which run into the  Severn  Sea Westward and that in  Dorset  which goes Eastward thro'  Sturminster  into the Southern Ocean It is a noble Fortification of the  Romans  The Prospect is woody and very pleasant hereandthere lofty and steep Hillocks  Roman  Coins  in great Plenty have been found here and in all the Country round The Entrance is guarded with Six or Seven Ditches On the Northside in the fourth Ditch is a never failing Spring called  King  Arthur  's Well  Over it they have dug up square Stones Doorjambs with Hinges and say there are subterraneous Vaults thereabout The Church and Tower of  Cadbury  is small but neatly built of Stone  At  Wincaunton  an Urn was lately found full of  Roman  Money Half a Peck of the same Coin was discovered in inclosing Ground toward  Beaconash  a little above  Sutton  as also  Patera's  a Knife and other Antiquities now in Lord  Winchelsca  's Custody in particular at  Longleat  in Lord  Weymouth  's Library a Piece of Lead weighing Pounds One Foot Nine Inches long Two Inches thick Three and an half broad found in Lord  Fitzharding  's Grounds near  Bruton  in  Somersetshire  was discovered by digging a Hole to set a Gatepost in with a legible Inscription  The Road from hence to  Glastenbury  is over Rocks and Heads of Rivers But that is alleviated by the many natural Curiosities such Places afford  Kyneton  Village for half a Mile together is naturally paved with one smooth broad Rock the whole Length of the Road so that it looks like Ice  Crossing the  Fosse  Road at  Lyteford  you enter a flat moorish Country full of artificial Cuts and Drains The Ascent to the  Torr  which overhangs the Town of  Glastenbury  is very difficult Upon a narrow Crest of the  Torr  which is much the highest the Abbot built a Church to St  Michael  of good square Stone The Tower is left tho' ruinous and is an excellent Seamark It probably cost more to raise the Stone to this Height than to erect the Building Half way up is a Spring it is  certainly higher than any Ground within Ten Miles of the Place In the Times of Superstition this great Monastery held the first Place for Reputation of Sanctity  The Inhabitants will have it that King  Arthur  was buried here and as a Proof thereof that his Coffin had been found in this Place and also that  Joseph  of  Arimathea  had been here and that when he had fixed his Staff in the Ground which was on  Christmasday  it immediately took Root budded put forth Whitethorn Leaves and the next Day was in full Blossom white as a Sheet and that the Plant is preserved and blows every  Christmasday  as at first to this very Time  I believe the Miracle amounts to no more than this  viz  That a kind of Whitethorn grows hereabout which in a mild Winter puts forth some Blossom about  Christmas  and I doubt not but some of the same Kind may be found at other Places if any Observations were made of it But this Place is remarkable for many other marvellous Stories recorded by the Monks who formerly possessed it  As to the Burial of King  Arthur  Mr  Camden  makes no doubt of it and gives us from  Giraldus Cambrensis  an Account how King  Henry  II caused Search to be made for his Tomb and before the Workmen had dug Seven Feet deep they came to a great Stone having a Cross of Lead on the Inside of it and the subsequent Letters or Inscription upon it and in the following rude Character which the said  Giraldus Cambrensis  Mr  Camden  says was an Eyewitness of as well as of a Coffin of hollow'd Oak which they found by digging Nine Feet deeper than the Inscription wherein were deposited the Bones of that great Prince The Inscription is as follows  But to leave these more disputable Points for Matters of greater Certainty it is not doubted but King  Ina  built the Church of  Glastenbury  as one of the most antient so the most wealthy and magnificent loaded with Revenues by the  Saxon  and perhaps the  British  Monarchs The Abbot lived in little less State than the Royal Donors his Revenue  amounting to  l  annually He could from the  Torr  see a vast Track of this rich Land in his own Possession and Seven Parks well stored with Deer belonging to the Monastery 'Tis walled round and imbattled like a Town a Mile in Compass  When I was last at  Glastenbury  there were magnificent Ruins but within a few Years a Presbyterian Tenant had made more barbarous Havock there than had been since the Dissolution for every Week a Pillar a Buttress a Windowjamb or an Angle of fine hewn Stone was sold to the best Bidder And they were actually stripping  St Joseph  's Chapel for that Purpose and the squared Stones were laid up by Lots in the Abbot's Kitchen The rest goes to paving Yards and Stalls for Cattle or to the Highway So much Dread indeed have the People here of Founders Curses that they are afraid to make use of the Materials for Dwellinghouses and are full of Stories of sad Accidents and Judgments that have fallen upon such as have but venture it for the Highways for a Townhouse and even for Barns and Stables so that as one observes where few are so hardy as to apply them to their particular or personal Use a publick Building shall be erected where all come in for their Snack  The Abbot's Lodging was a fine Stone Building but could not content the justmentioned Tenant who pulled it down and out of it built a new House absurdly setting up the Arms and Cognizances of the great  Saxon  Kings and Princes who were Founders and of the Abbots over his own Doors and Windows Nothing is left intire but the Kitchen a judicious Piece of Architecture But Tradition says that this is but a modern Building for the Story goes That  Whiting  the last Abbot being dealt with by  Henry  VIII and his Cormorants for a Surrender and bravely refusing to join in the Sacrilege  that Prince proceeded to Menaces and told him he  "would burn his Kitchen about his Ears"  To which he returned Answer  "That he would build such an one as all the Timber in the Forest should not burn"  And accordingly as 'tis said built this in Defiance which is all of firm Stone Walls and Roof having nothing combustible in it But what neither Flattery nor Menaces could effect Tyranny and Murder brought about For the Abbot was hanged on  St Michael  's Tower just now mentioned on the Top of the high Hill called  The Torr  thereby accomplishing a Prophecy as the Townsmen call it but rather occasioning a Saying since spread abroad  That a  Whiting  should swim over  Glastenbury Torr  The Church was large and magnificent the Walls of the Choir are standing Fathom long and broad There is one Jamb at the Eastend of the High Altar left  Hereabout were buried King  Edgar  and many of the  Saxon  Monarchs whose noble Ashes ought to have protected the Whole  Two Pillars of the great Middle Tower are left next the Choir On the Northside is  St Mary  's Chapel as they told me the Roof beat down by Violence and a mean wooden one in its Place thatched with Stubble to make it serve as a Stable The Manger lies upon the Altar and Nich where they put the HolyWater  St Edgar  's Chapel is opposite to it but there is not much left of it beside the Foundations The present Work is Paces long wide without The Roof is chiefly wanting Two little Turrets are at the Corners of the Westend and Two more at the Interval of Four Windows from thence which seem to indicate the Space of Ground the first Chapel was built on the rest between it and the Church was a kind of Antechapel Underneath was a Vault now full of  Water the Floor of the Chapel being beaten down into it it was wrought with great Stones  Here was a capacious Receptacle of the Dead They have taken up many leaden Coffins and melted them into Cisterns  The Roof of the Chapel was finely arched with Ribwork of Stone The Sides of the Walls are full of small Pillars of  Sussex  Marble as likewise the whole Church which was a mean way of Ornamenting in those Times they are mostly beaten down Between them the Walls are painted with Pictures of Saints as still easily seen All the Walls are overgrown with Ivy which is the only thing here in a flourishing Condition every thing else presenting a most melancholy tho' venerable Aspect On the Southside the Cloisters was the great Hall  The Townsmen bought the Stones of the Vaults underneath to build a sorry Markethouse not discerning the Benefit accruing to the Town from the great Concourse of Strangers purposely to see this Abbey which is now its greatest Trade as formerly its only Support for 'tis in a most miserable decaying Condition as wholly cut off from the large Revenues spent among them  There are many other Foundations of the Buildings left in the great Area but in the present Hands will soon be rooted up and the very Footsteps of them effaced which so many Ages had been erecting  The Abbot's Hall I have been told was curiously wainscotted with Oak and painted with Coats of Arms in every Panel The Morter of these Buildings is very good and great Rocks of the Roof of the Church lie upon the Ground chiefly consisting of Rubblestone untouched by the fanatical Destroyers who chiefly work on the hewn Stone of the Outside till a whole Wall falls when undermined a little  Throughout the Town are the tattered Remains of Doors Windows Bases Capitals of Pillars  c  brought from the Abbey and put into every poor Cottage  In the Town are Two Churches the upper a handsome Fabrick with a fine Tower of good Design adorned with Figures in Niches The  George  Inn is an old Stone Building called  the Abbot's Inn  where chiefly the Pilgrims were lodged who came strolling hither and idling their Time away for Sanctity A Coat of Arms of the Kings of  England  supported by a Lion and a Bull is over the Gate with many Crosses There was a Bed of large Timber with imbossed gilt Panels which seemed to have been the Abbot's  Four Miles from  Glastenbury  lies the little City of  Wells  where is one of the neatest Cathedrals in  England  particularly the West Front of it which is a complete Draught of Imagery as well as very antient  The Close or Part of the City where the Bishop's Palace is is very properly called so for it is walled in and locked up like a little Fortification and has a Ditch round it The dignified Clergy live in the Inside of it and the Prebendaries and Canons have very agreeable Dwellings Here are no less than Prebendaries and Canons besides a Dean a Chancellor a Precentor and Three Archdeacons a Number which very few Cathedrals in  England  have besides  The County is the Diocese and contains Parishes and the Archdeaconries are of  Wells Bath  and  Taunton    The City lies just at the Foot of the Mountains called  Mendiphills  and is built on a stony Foundation Its Manufacture is chiefly of Stockens as has been said 'tis wellbuilt and populous  Near this City and just under the Hills is the famous  Wokey Hole  the chief Curiosity of which is frequently found in all such subterraneous Caverns that the Water dropping from the Roof of the Vault petrifies and hangs in long Pieces like Icicles as if it would in Time turn into a Column to support the Arch  Not far from hence is  Sedgmore  a watry splashy Place and infamous for the Defeat of the Duke of  Monmouth    In the low Country on the other Side  Mendip  Hills lies  Chedder  a Village pleasantly situated under the very Ridge of the Mountains before the Village is a large Green or Common on which all the Cows belonging to the Town feed the Ground is exceeding rich and as the Inhabitants are Cowkeepers they take care to maintain the Goodness of the Soil by agreeing to lay on large Quantities of Dung for manuring and inriching the Land  Several Persons frequently here mix their Milk together which often weighs a hundred Weight sometimes more and is so excellent that it is often sold from Sixpence to Eightpence  per  Pound when the  Cheshire  Cheese is sold but from Twopence to Twopence Halfpenny  Here is a deep frightful Chasm in the Mountain in the Hollow of which the Road goes toward  Bristol  and out of the same Hollow springs a little Stream which is so rapid that it is said to drive Mills within a Quarter of a Mile of the Spring but it must be supposed to fetch some winding Reaches in the Way otherwise there would not be room for Mills to stand and have a sufficient Head of Water to each within so small a Space of Ground The Water of this Spring grows quickly into a River and runs down into the Marshes and joins another little River called  Axe  about  Axbridge  and thence into the  Bristol  Chanel or  Severn  Sea  I must now turn East and Southeast for I resolved not to go up the Hills of  Mendip  at all this Journey leaving that Part to another Tour when I shall give an Account of these Mountains as also of the Cities of  Bath  and  Bristol  to which they are very near in one Letter  I come now to that Part of the County which joins to  Wiltshire  which I reserved in particular to this Place in order to give some Account of the Broadcloth Manufacture which I several times mentioned before and which is carried on here to such a Degree as to deserve a Place in all the Descriptions or Histories which shall be given of this Country  As the East and South Parts of  Wiltshire  are all hilly spreading themselves far and wide in Plains and grassy Downs for breeding and feeding vast Flocks of Sheep and as the West and North Parts of  Somersetshire  are on the contrary low and marshy or moorish for feeding and breeding of Black Cattle and Horses or for Lead Mines  c  so all the Southwest Part of  Wiltshire  and the East Part of  Somersetshire  are low and flat being a rich inclosed Country full of Rivers and Towns and infinitely populous insomuch that some of the Markettowns are equal to Cities in Bigness and superior to many of them in Numbers of People  This low flat Country contains Part of the Three Counties of  Somerset Wilts  and  Gloucester  and that the Extent of it may be the easier understood by those who know any thing of the Situation of the Country it reaches from  Cirencester  in the North to  Sherburn  on the Edge of  Dorsetshire  South and from the  Devizes  East to  Bristol  West which may take in about Miles in Length where longest and in Breadth where narrowest  In this Extent of Country we have the following Markettowns which are principally imployed in  the Clothing Trade that is to say in that Part of it which I am now speaking of namely fine Medley or mixed Cloths such as are usually worn in  England  by the better Sort of People and also exported in great Quantities to  Holland Hamburgh Sweden Denmark Spain Italy  c The principal Clothing Towns in this Part of the Country are these  Somersetshire  Frome Pentford Philip'sNorton Bruton SheptonMallet CastleCarey  and  Wincaunton    Wiltshire  Malmsbury Castlecomb Chippenham Caln Devizes Bradford Trubridge Westbury Warminster Mere  Dorsetshire  Gillingham Shaftsbury Bemister  and  Bere Sturminster Shireborn    Gloucestershire  Cirencester Tetbury Marshfield Minchinghampton  and  Fairford    These Towns as they stand thin and at considerable Distance from one another for except the Two Towns of  Bradford  and  Trubridge  the others stand at an unusual Distance are interspersed with a very great Number of Villages Hamlets and scattered Houses in which generally speaking the spinning Work of all this Manufacture is performed by the poor People the Master Clothiers who generally live in the greater Towns sending out the Wool weekly to their Houses by their Servants and Horses and at the same time bringing back the Yarn that they have spun and finished which then is fitted for the Loom  The increasing and flourishing Circumstances of this Trade are happily visible by the great Concourse of People to and Increase of Buildings and Inhabitants  in these principal Clothing Towns where this Trade is carried on and in the Wealth of the Clothiers The Town of  Frome  or as it is written in our Maps  FromeSellwood  is a Specimen of this which is so prodigiously increased within these last or Years that they have built a new Church and so many new Streets of Houses and these Houses are so full of Inhabitants that  Frome  is now reckoned to have more Inhabitants in it than the City of  Bath  and some say than  Salisbury  and if their Trade continues to increase in like manner for a few Years more it is very likely to become one of the greatest and wealthiest inland Towns in  England    Its Trade is wholly Clothing and the Cloths they make are generally speaking all convey'd to  London  where  Blackwellhall  is their Market and if we may believe common Fame there are above People in  Frome  now more than lived in it Years ago and yet it was a considerable Town then  Here are also several large Meetinghouses as well as Churches as there are generally in all the manufacturing trading Towns in  England  especially in the Western Counties  The  Devizes  is next to  Frome  a large and important Town and full of wealthy Clothiers but it has lately run pretty much into the Druggetmaking Trade a Business which has made some Invasion upon that of the Broadcloth great Quantities of Druggets being worn in as well as exported from  England  instead of Broadcloth but this is much the same as to the Trade still for since it is all a Woolen Manufacture and the Druggets may properly be called Cloth tho' narrow and of a different Make so the Makers are all called Clothiers  The River  Avon  a noble and large fresh River branching itself into many Parts and receiving almost  all the Rivers on that Side of the Hills waters this whole fruitful Vale and the Water of this River seems particularly qualified for dying the best Colours and for Fulling and Dressing the Cloth so that the Clothiers generally plant themselves upon this River but especially the Dyers as at  Trubridge  and  Bradford  which are the Two most eminent Clothing Towns in that Part of the Vale for the Making fine  Spanish  Cloths and for the nicest Mixtures  From these Towns South to  Westbury  and  Warminster  the same Trade continues and the finest Medley  Spanish  Cloths in the whole World are made in this Part They told me at  Bradford  that it was no extraordinary thing to have Clothiers thereabout worth from to  l  a Man and many of the Gentry in those Counties have been originally raised from this truly noble Manufacture  If I may speak here from the Authority of the antient Inhabitants of the Place who have been curious Observers upon this Subject the Country which I have now described as principally imployed in and maintained by this Prodigy of a Trade contains Acres of Land and has in it Parishes and People It is true that this is all Guesswork but I must confess myself very willing to believe that the Reckoning is far short of the Account for this Part is exceeding large and populous  It may be worth Inquiry how the Manufacturers in so vast a Consumption of the Wool as such a Trade must take up can be supplied with Wool for their Trade and indeed it would be something strange if the Answer were not at hand  We may reasonably conclude that this Manufacture was at first seated in this County or as we may say originally planted itself here because of the infinite Numbers of Sheep which were always upon the Downs and Plains of  Dorset Wilts  and  Hampshire  all adjoining This no doubt induced  the first Planters of the Clothing Manufacture to make Choice of this delightful Vale in the Neighbourhood of those Plains which afforded such immense Funds of Wool for the carrying on their Works Thus the Manufacture of white Cloth was planted in  Stroudwater  in  Gloucestershire  for the sake of the excellent Water there for the Dying Scarlets and all Colours that are dyed in Grain which are better done there than in any other Place of  England  some Towns near  London  excepted Hence therefore we first observe they are supplied yearly with the Fleeces of Two or Three Millions of Sheep  But as the Number of Sheep fed on these Downs is lessened rather than increased because of so many thousand Acres of the Carpet Ground being of late Years converted into Tillage and sowed with  This Alteration has made  Warminster  a Markettown on the Edge of  Somersetshire  the greatest Market for Wheat in  England  where none of it is bought to send to  London    Wheat and at the same time the Manufacture prodigiously increasing the Manufacturers applied to other Parts for a Supply and hence began the Influx of North Country Wool from the Counties of  Northampton Leicester  and  Lincoln  the Centre and Markets of which Trade are about  Tetbury  and  Cirencester  where several hundred Packs are sold every Week to supply this prodigious Consumption  From  London  they have great Quantities of Wool which is generally called  Kentish  Wool in the Fleece which is brought up from thence by the Farmers since the late severe Acts against their Selling it within a certain Number of Miles of the Sea also Fellwool for the Combers bought of the Woolstaplers in  Barnabystreet  and sent back by the Carriers which bring up the Cloths to Market  They have also sometimes large Quantities of  Irish  Wool by the way of  Bristol  or of  Minehead  in  Somersetshire  but this is uncertain and only on extraordinary Occasions I omit the  Spanish  Wool as being an Article by itself  Thus as those who see the almost countless Numbers of Sheep on the Downs and Plains and the great Quantities of Wool brought to the Markets of  Tetbury  and other Towns as well as what are sent down from  London  into this single Vale would wonder how it was possible so much Wool could be consumed manufactured and wrought up so on the other hand those that see what Numbers of People are imployed and what vast Quantities of Goods are made in this Part of  England  would wonder how the Nation should be able to supply them with Wool  And yet notwithstanding the whole Country is thus busy'd in the Broadcloth Manufacture I must not omit to mention that here is a very great Application to another Branch or two of Trade  viz  The supplying the City of  London  with Provisions Tho' it is true that the general Imployment of the People in all this County is in the Woollen Manufacture yet as the Spinning is generally the Work of the Women and Children and the Land is here exceeding rich and fertile so it cannot be supposed but that here are Farmers in great Numbers whose Business it is to cultivate the Land and supply the rest of the Inhabitants with Provisions and this they do so well that notwithstanding the County is exceeding populous yet Provisions of all Sorts are cheap the Quantity very great and a considerable Overplus sent every Day to  London    All the lower Part of this County and also of  Gloucestershire  adjoining is full of large feeding Farms which we call Dairies and the Cheese they make is excellent and is eaten newer than that from  Cheshire  Of this a vast Quantity is every Week sent up to  London  where tho' it is called  Gloucestershire  Cheese yet the greatest Part of it comes from  Wiltshire  the  Gloucestershire  Cheese being more generally carried to  Bristol  and  Bath  where a very great Quantity is consumed as well by the Inhabitants of these two populous Cities as in Exportation to our  WestIndia  Colonies and other Places whereas this  Wiltshire  Cheese is carried to the River of  Thames  which runs thro' Part of the County by Landcarriage and so by Barges to  London    Again in the Spring of the Year they make a vast Quantity of that we call Green or New Cheese which is a thin and very soft Cheese resembling Cream Cheeses but somewhat thicker These are so universally liked in  London  that all the low rich Lands of this County are hardly enough to supply the Market but then this holds for little more than the Two first Summer Months of the Year  Besides this the Farmers in  Wiltshire  and the Part of  Gloucestershire  adjoining send a very great Quantity of Bacon up to  London  which is esteemed the best Bacon in  England Hampshire  only excepted This Bacon is raised here by their great Dairies as the Hogs are fed with the vast Quantities of Whey and skimmed Milk which the Farmers must otherwise have thrown away  But this is not all for as the North Part of  Wiltshire  as well the Downs as the Vales border upon the River  Thames  and in some Places come up even to the Banks of it so most of that Part of the County being arable Land they sow a very great Quantity of Barley which is carried to the Markets at  Abingdon  at  Faringdon  and such Places where it is made into Malt and carried to  London  This imploys all the Hillcountry from above  Malmsbury  to  Marlborough  and on the Side of the Vale of  Whitehorse  as 'tis called which is in  Berkshire  and the Hills adjoining a Track of fertile Ground which furnishes a prodigious Quantity of Barley  Thus  Wiltshire  helps to supply  London  with Cheese Bacon and Malt Three very considerable Articles besides that vast Manufacture of fine  Spanish  Cloths of which I have said so much and I may without Partiality say that it is thereby rendered one of the most important Counties in  England  to the publick Wealth of the Kingdom The bare Product is in itself prodigiously great the Downs are an inexhausted Storehouse of Wool and of Corn and the Valley or low Part of it is the like for Cheese and Bacon  One Thing here is worth while to mention for the Observation of those Counties in  England  where they are not yet arrived to that Perfection in Husbandry as in this County and I have purposely reserved it to this Place and that is The Downs or Plains which tho' generally called  Salisbury Plain  yet extend themselves into the Counties of  Southampton Wilts  and  Dorset  were formerly wholly taken up with Sheep as being thought incapable of producing Grain but now are made to yield most plentiful Crops by folding their Sheep upon the plough'd Lands removing the Fold every Night to a fresh Place till the whole Fallow has been folded on This alone has made these Lands which in themselves are poor and in some Places so shallow as that the Earth is not six Inches deep over the solid Chalk able to bear as good Wheat as any of the richer Lands in the Vales tho' not altogether in such great Quantities And were it not for this Improvement the Product would hardly compensate the Ploughman's Labour for many of these Lands lie up such high Hills so remote from the Farmers Houses which are always in the Valleys that it would be very difficult to carry up their Dung to manure them  If this way of folding Sheep upon the Fallows and ploughed Lands were practised in some other Parts  of  Britain  and especially in  Scotland  it would effectually improve the waste Lands which now are useless and uncultivated and turn both Sheep and Lands to a better Account than was ever yet known among them In  Wiltshire  it appears to be so very significantly for if a Farmer has a Thousand Sheep and no Fallows to fold them on his Neighbours will give him Ten Shillings a Night for every Thousand  But as I have not mentioned these Clothing Towns other than as they contribute to that Trade I shall now proceed to say something of the Towns themselves except those in  Gloucestershire  of which I shall speak in my next Letter as I fall down Westward  ShiptonMallet Castle Carey Wincaunton  and  Bruton  lie to the Southward of  Wells  and have nothing remarkable in them except the last which lies on the River  Brews  It has a fair Church a good Freeschool and a stately Almshouse the Ruins of a Priory and beside the Clothingtrade is famous for Stockens  Frome  and  Philips Norton  lie East of  Somersetshire  upon the Borders of  Wilts  The first is near the Forest of  Selwood  and I have already mentioned its prodigious Increase of late Years The last is a very good Markettown and has Two annual Fairs one reputed for a Oneday Fair as great as any in  England    Bensford  is a small Markettown and lies Northwest toward  Bristol    Malmsbury  is a very antient Town and 'tis said was built by a  British  Prince called  Caer Bladdon  It was formerly defended by Walls and a large strong Castle which was razed afterward to inlarge the Abbey which was very famous and the greatest in  Wiltshire  the Abbot sat in Parliament King  Athelstane  was buried here and they still shew  his Tomb here Vast Piles of Buildings were pulled down at the Dissolution but the Church of the Abbey was saved a great Part of which still remains and is used as the Parish Church It is a Corporation governed by a  Justice  who is an annual Magistrate and called  The Alderman  It has a good Market weekly The Town is neat and lies on the River  Avon  It is also famous for the Birthplace of  William  of  Malmsbury  the Historian and of that great Scholar Philosopher and Mathematician  Hobbes  and of divers other very great and remarkable Men  Near this Town Southward on the same River lies the Village of  Dantsey  which tho' but an obscure Place has given Title of Honour to many eminent Persons and among the rest to  Henry Danvers  created Baron of this Place by King  James  I tho' afterwards made Earl of  Danby  He had distinguished himself in Queen  Elizabeth  's  Irish  Wars was as good as great and died with Glory but his Brother and Heir having sat ungratefully a Judge on that very King who made his Brother Earl was at the Restoration attainted of High Treason and this his Manor of  Dantsey  given to  James  then Duke of  York  who settled it in Dowry on his second Consort On his Abdication it became a second time forfeited and King  William  conferred it on  Charles  Lord  Mordaunt  late Earl of  Peterborough  and  Monmouth  in whose Family it still remains But as there are some other Things more than ordinarily particular relating to this Manor I shall inlarge a little upon it  The whole Parish of  Dantsey  consists of this Manor only and not a Foot of Ground in it belongs to any other Person it is altogether Pasture and indeed very rich The Inhabitants who are all Tenants of the Manor make most excellent Cheese not at all inferior to that of  Chedder  which is the  only Commodity in the Place for the late Lord would not permit the Grounds to be ploughed up and I believe there is not an Acre in the Parish of arable Land tho' the Tenants have offered a considerable Advance of Rent for Liberty to break up the Ground which indeed seems to want it and would be much better'd by the Plough nor would his Lordship for some Years before his Death renew a Life upon it either by Lease or Copyhold except as many of the last as would keep up the Homage and the Rights of the Manor and the Reason of this was not only to get a clear Rackrent Estate in it but to prevent the Cheats and Impositions which the Copyhold Tenants of the Manor put upon their Lord for as every Widow has her Life in her Husband's Copyhold after his Death if she continues sole and continent 'tis a very common thing there for an old Man on his Deathbed to marry a young Woman who privately contracts to give Part of the Profits of the Copyhold or some Consideration for it to the Husband's Relations and not seldom selects for a Bedfellow for herself one of her favourite Menservants  The Abuse which accrued from granting Leases on Lives is this That whereas a Person takes a Lease for Three Lives  viz  his own his Wife's and his Son  John  's to defraud the Lord of the Manor he names all his Sons  John  so that as long as any of the Sons live  John  in the Lease never dies  By these Frauds the Earl who was none of the best Oeconomists and lived remote from this Place suffered considerably tho' he could not find out how but frequently complained That his Lessees and his CopyholdWidows were very long lived and in an humorous way used to recommend his Manor of  Dantsey  to all such as were apprehensive of dying  As all in the Parish were his Tenants and had an Interest in the Fraud they combined against him so that he could get no Intelligence of it and tho' his Lordship enjoyed the Manor ever since the Revolution yet by reason of its being then full estated that is all let out upon Lives then actually subsisting and continued by the abovementioned Frauds his Lordship received no great Benefit out of it till some few Years before his Death when he came to a Resolution not to renew tho' when all the Lives drop in this Manor will at a Rackrent amount to at least  l  a Year  There is a large old Mansionhouse here lying just on the River with Gardens formed after the Manner of those at  Parsonsgreen  but it is not a kindly Place for ripening Fruit and the Grounds lie very low and splashy being all of a stiff Clay and yet very good Pasture Here is also a fine Park well timber'd but without Deer His Lordship had once a Design to improve this Mansionhouse and Estate and resided here in when he was called to Court and sent to command the Queen's Forces in  Spain  where his Conduct and great Services to his Country are too well known to need mentioning here  Tho' this Place is often overflowed with Water yet there is none good either for Brewing or Washing or any Spring of sweet Water Here is a Spring of a chalybeat Kind which would turn to good Account were it not in such a distant and an almost inaccessible Part of the Country occasioned by bad Roads which were a great Protection to the Inhabitants in the late Civil Wars who were never visited by either Party but injoyed an easy and uninterrupted Repose whlist their Neighbours on all Sides were involved in the Calamities of that unnatural War  Here is likewise a good neat Church with one of the bestbuilt high square Towers I ever saw raised at the Expence of one of the Lords of  Dantsey  probably the aforementioned  Henry  who lies buried here under a very large magnificent Tomb Here likewise is interred LieutenantGeneral  Lewis Mordaunt  a Brother of the late Earl a Gentleman noted for his great Wit Humour and polite Conversation as indeed all his Brothers were as well as his Lordship  Castlecomb  is a Village of small Account  Chippenham  is a corporate good Markettown likewise on the River  Avon  over which it has a Bridge of Sixteen Arches famous for the Residence and Resort of many of the West  Saxon  Kings particularly  Alfred  Here is a very magnificent Church and near this Place formerly was a famous Forest  Bradford  is a Markettown and has a Bridge over the  Avon  'Tis wellbuilt of Stone and lies in the Side of a Hill  Trubridge  is an antient Markettown and had formerly a Castle of Seven Towers but long since destroyed The Court of the Duchy of  Lancaster  for this County is annually held here  Westbury  is a little Borough Markettown but was formerly of great Note Some Quantity of  Roman  Coins have been found here  Warminster  is noted as I have said for the prodigious Quantity of Corn which is sold in it every Marketday Upon the Downs near this Town are two antient Camps supposed to be  Danish    It is observable That these Five last Towns belonged antiently to the Family of the  Hungerfords  which in King  Edward  IV's Reign came by Marriage to the Lord  Hastings  who being executed in  Richard  III's Time this vast Estate was given by that King to  Howard  Duke of  Norfolk  first EarlMarshal of that Family in  England    Near  Warminster  is the famous Forest of  Selwood  called by the antient  Britons Coedmaur  i e  Greatwood  It is Miles in Length and very thick of Wood  Mere  which in the old  Saxon  signifys  Boundary  as this Place seems to be on the Borders of  Wilts Somerset  and  Dorset  is but a Village and yet gives Name to the Hundred where it stands It has neither Fair nor Market in it but it had antiently a Castle Not far from this Place is an old  Danish  Camp called  Whitesholehill  Sir  Francis Cotton  who flourished in the Reign of King  James  and afterwards of  Charles  I was born here  A little Southeast of  Mere  lies  Hindon  a small Borough and Markettown And Northeast of it stands  Heightsbury  an inconsiderable Town but noted formerly for an Hospital  Lavington  is also a little more North a very indifferent Markettown  The  Devizes  is excellently situated about Two Miles from the Bottom of the Hills which keep off the Eastern Winds and in a rich Soil Under the Hill at  Runway  is an excellent Spring which the Inhabitants have not yet found Means to convey thither tho' it runs but a little way off the Town where they want Water It is a very large old Town consisting chiefly of Two long parallel Streets the Houses mostly of Timber but of a very good Model The Inhabitants value themselves for being Tenants to the King and for one of the best weekly Markets in  England  The Castle was originally  Roman  judiciously seated upon a natural Fortification but in Aftertimes made in a manner impregnable by  Roger  a Bishop of  Salisbury  tho' now it suffers daily by Peoples taking away the Materials Here are Two Churches The Choir of  St Mary's  is of a very old Model as are the Steeple Choir and both Wings of  St John's  to which Additions have been made and new wide Windows with pointed  Arches in the room of the antient narrow semicircular ones  Just out of Town is a pretty Plain called  the Green  with another handsome Church and Steeple Suburbs to the old Town Here  William Cadby  a Gardener dug up his Collection of Gods which he carried about for a Shew They were found in a Garden in a Cavity inclosed with  Roman  Brick The  Venus  is of an excellent Design and the  Vestal Virgin  as they call it a Fragment of  Corinthian  Brass and of very curious Workmanship  Vulcan  is as lame as if made at a Forge He had also several Coins found thereabouts and a Brass  Roman  Key which my Lord  Winchelsea  bought  Roman  Antiquities are discovered here every Day The same Nobleman has a Brass  Probus  on the Reverse  Victoria Germ  with a Trophy A great Number of such Reliques is to be met with all round the Country  Calne  is a little Town situate on a stony Hill and very antient and is supposed to have been one of the Seats of the  WestSaxon  Kings It has a neat Church and a good weekly Market After a great Rain in  November  the Waters rose so very high here on a sudden that they overflow'd the Town damaged a great Quantity of Goods drowned Two Men in the Street and carried off a Cask of Oil of Gallons which could not be found for several Days after A great Parcel of  Roman  Coins were dug up here formerly Here was likewise antiently an Hospital of  Black Canons    I am now come into the Road to  Marlborough  On the Downs about Two or Three Miles from the Town are abundance of loose Stones lying scattered about the Plain some whereof are very large and appear to be of the same Kind with those of  Stonehenge  and some larger they are called by the Country People the  Grey Weathers  and it must be confessed that they look not unlike Sheep straggling upon the  Downs on a transient and distant View as Travellers pass These  Grey Weathers  on a more curious Inspection are found to be a Sort of white Marble and lie upon the Surface of the Ground in infinite Numbers and of all Dimensions They are loose detached from any Rock and as Dr  Stukeley  thinks lay there ever since the Creation being solid Parts thrown out to the Surface of the fluid Globe when its Rotation was first impressed  Marlborough  so called from its Hills of Chalk which antiently was called  Marle  It is the  Cunetia  from  Kenet  of the  Romans  but from the coming of the  Saxons  to the Conquest there is no Mention of it It is governed by a Mayor Aldermen and Burgesses and is wellbuilt It consists chiefly of One broad and strait Street To the South are some Relicks of a Priory the Gatehouse is still remaining On the North the Chapel of another Religious House remains now turned into a Dwellinghouse The Seat of my Lord  Hertford  was the Scite of the  Roman Costrum  for there they find Foundations and  Roman  Coins and towards the River without the Gardenwalls one Angle of it very manifestly remains and the Rampart  d Ditch intire The Road going over the Bridge cuts it off from the present Castle The Ditch is still Feet wide in some Parts The Mount so much noted was the Keep of the Castle it is now converted into a pretty spiral Walk on the Top of which is an octagonal Summerhouse from whence you have a pleasant View over the Town and County The Town has at present a pretty good Shopkeeping Trade but not much of the manufacturing Part The River  Kennet  some Years ago made navigable by Act of Parliament rises just by this Town from whence running to  Hungerford  and  Newbury  it becomes a large Stream and passing by  Reading  runs into the  Thames  near that Town  This River is famous for Crayfish which they help Travellers to at  Newbury  but they seldom want for Price  At  Abury  near  Marlborough  Downs in the Way to  Bath  are to be seen the stupendous Remains of a  Druids  Temple being a Collection of monstrous Stones of the like Nature with those of  Stonehenge  and brought together from the Downs for the same religious Purposes as Dr  Stukeley  makes no Question  On the Hills on this Side the  Devizes  is  Roundway Down  where the King's Forces under Prince  Maurice  but owing chiefly to the Lord  Wilmot  beat and intirely routed the famous Sir  William Waller  in the Civil Wars from whence the Place is called by some  Runaway Down  to this Day  A little nearer towards  Marlborough  is  St Ann's Hill  where notwithstanding several high Hills between and the Distance of Twentytwo Miles or more is a fair View of  Salisbury  Steeple or Spire which is deem'd the highest in  England    At  Badmington  in  Wiltshire  have been found  Nine Caves  all in a Row but of different Dimensions the least of them Four Feet wide some Nine or Ten Feet long Two long Stones being set upon the Sides and the Top cover'd with broad Stones Spurs Pieces of Armour and the like have been found in these  Caves  which gives Ground to believe that they were Tombs of some antient Warriors  Romans Saxons  or  Danes    In our Way from  Marlborough  to  Newbury  we mounted a chalky Hill of which Sort is much of the Soil of  Wilts  on the Top of which we enter'd into  Savernack  Forest belonging to the R  ght Hon the Lord  Bruce  and is almost the only privileged Ground of Hunting of that Denomination possess'd by a Subject It is in Circumference about Twelve Miles plentifully stock'd with Deer of a large Size  and render'd very pleasant and delightful by the many Walks and Vistas lately cut and levell'd through the several Coppices and Woods with which it abounds Eight of these Vistas meet like so many Rays of a Star in a Point near the Middle of the Forest where his Lordship has prepared and cleared the Ground for erecting an Octagon Tower whose Sides will be correspondent to the Vistas thro' one of which you will have a View of his Lordship's Seat at about Two Miles Distance called  Tottenham  from a Park of that Name in which it is situate contiguous to the Forest  It is a stately Edifice newly erected on the same Spot of Ground where stood an antient Palace destroyed by Fire of the Marquis of  Hereford  so justly celebrated for his steady Adherence and powerful Assistance to the Royal Cause during the whole Course of the Civil Wars from whom his Lordship is descended by his Mother the Lady  Elizabeth  Sister and Niece to the Two last Dukes of  Somerset  of the elder Line  To give you some Idea of the Grandeur and Magnificence of the Structure it will be sufficient to observe that it was begun carried on and finish'd after the Model and under the Direction of our modern  Vitruvius  the Earl of  Burlington  who to the Strength and Convenience of the  English  Architecture has added the Elegance and Politeness of the  Italian  Taste  The House has Four Towers and Four Fronts each of them diversly beautified and adorned to which are now added Four Wings wherein are Rooms of State a noble and capacious Room for a Library containing a judicious and large Collection of several Thousand Books in all Languages but especially the modern  The Beauty and Delightfulness of the Buildings are much augmented by the large Canals the spacious  and wellplanted Walks which surround it one of which leading to the  London  Road extends Two Miles in Length  About the same Distance from hence on the opposite Side are to be seen the Remains of a large House the Seat of Sir  John Seymour  Father of the unfortunate Protector call'd  WolfHall  of which no more is standing than suffices for a Farmhouse Here King  Henry  VIII as Tradition goes celebrated his Nuptials with the Lady  Jane Seymour  and kept his Weddingdinner in a very large Barn hung with Tapestry on the Occasion for Confirmation of which they shew you in the Walls thereof some Tenterhooks with small Pieces of Tapestry fasten'd to them and between this Place and  Tottenham  th  re is a Walk with old Trees on each Side still known by the Name of King  Harry  's Walk  From hence continuing our Course Easterly we came to a Boroughtown called  Great Bedwin  which Dr  Stukeley  takes to be the  Leucomagus  of  Ravennas  It is an old Corporation and gave Birth to the famous Dr  T Willis  the Ornament of  English  Physicians  Castle Copse  half a Mile from the Town South East was probably the  Roman  Castle and  Havisdike  a Camp of that People Some time since there was in the East Window of the Church the Picture of a Priest with Two Crutches a Cup in his Hand and a Can standing by him with an Inscription in old  English  Capitals but in the Language obsolete  French  which in  English  is this  I am  Peris  call'd Vicar of this Church  Upon my Crutches leaning just in this wise  My Pouch in my Fist and I'll drink without Guile  My Pot at my Back set after the new Mode  To my Pot and my Pouch I will have Justice done  For none shall drink without putting in as much again  The Church is large and capacious in which are some antient Monuments particularly one of a  KnightTemplar  call'd  Adam of Scott  from a Manor of that Name in the Parish with an Inscription not legible and another abovementioned of Sir  John Seymour  Father of the Protector wherein we have an Account of the Names of all his Children with their several Intermarriages and Deaths The Church is very strongly built with Flint and a Cement near as hard as themselves in form of a Cross in the Centre of which is erected a high Tower containing a good Ring of Six very musical Bells  Moving hence towards the Northeast a little we cross'd the much fam'd  Wansdyke  a Work of prodigious Labour and Expence and concluded by most Writers to be a Boundary of one of the Kingdoms of the  Heptarchy  probably that of the  West Saxons  before its Inlargement by incroaching on other Kingdoms It may be traced from near  Bath  all over the Downs to this Place where it turns its Course towards the Southern Coasts it is supposed by some to derive its Name from  Woden  one of the  Saxon  Deities  Soon after we mounted a small Hill of easy Ascent on the Summit of which was erected as Historians inform us a fortified Place the Residence of  Cissa  a Viceroy of one of the  SouthSaxon  Kings from whom it derives its Denomination of  Chisbury  or  Cisbury  who also built  Chichester  for the Resort of his People as he did this for the Repose of himself It seems to have been strongly fortified being surrounded with a double Ditch or Mote of considerable Depth and Breadth and full of Water since which time there has been a Religious House here the Chapel of which is still remaining but converted into a Barn  From hence we returned to the great  London  Road and soon arrived at a Village called  Froxfield    about Seven Miles from  Marlborough  in which is a handsome and wellendow'd Almshouse founded by  Sarah  Duchess Dowager of  Somerset  Relict of  John  the last Duke of the elder Branch of the noble Family of  Seymours  descended from the great Duke of  Somerset  Protector of the King and Kingdom during the Minority of King  Edward  VI This Lady bequeath'd by her Will above  l  for the Building and Furniture of this Almshouse and devised several Manors Messuages and Farms for the Maintenance of Thirty poor Widows not haveing  l per Ann  to subsist upon one Half of which are Widows of Clergymen and the other of Laymen giving a Preference to those of the last Sort who live on the Manors so devised by her She left in her Will particular Directions for the Form Dimensions and Scite of the Structure and for the Manner of electing ruling and providing for the Widows which her Executors especially Sir  William Gregory  who chiefly took upon him the Execution of the Trust punctually observ'd  The Building is neat and strong in the Form of a Quadrangle having one Front and a Court before it facing the Road It contains Thirty Groundrooms and as many Chambers one of each Sort being allowed to every Widow for her Apartment with an Area or Bed in a Garden on the North Part of the Building inclosed with a Brickwall  In the midst of the Quadrangle is built a handsome and convenient Chapel furnished with a CommunionTable Pulpit Desk Pews and Books for the Use of the Widows wherein the Chaplain whose Stipend is  l per Ann  is to read Prayers every Day and to preach on  Sundays  and for his further Encouragement is to be presented on a Vacancy to the Rectory of  Kemish  in the same County which the Duchess has appropriated to that Use Besides the yearly Pension in Money which  is now about Eight Guineas she hath also ordered a Clothgown with a certain Quantity of Wood every Winter to each of the Widows and when the Estates which she has given to the said Almshouse many of which are now demised upon Leases for Lives shall fall in and shall produce a clear yearly Income of more than  l  she hath appointed additional Lodgings to be built for the Reception of Twenty more Widows who are to be placed on the same Establishment elected and provided for in the same manner as the Thirty former and then all the Rents and Profits of the said Estates the Salary for the Chaplain and a Steward being first deducted shall be distributed in equal Shares and Proportions between the Fifty Widows  The Produce of all the Estates devised to this and another charitable Use which I shall mention byandby upon the Determination of the Leases granted will according to the best Information I could get amount to little less than  l per Ann  This truly useful and excellent Charity which displays the Judgment as well as charitable Disposition of the noble Foundress is under the Inspection and Management of several worthy Gentlemen and Clergymen of the Neighbourhood who discharge the Trust reposed in them with a very laudable Diligence and Integrity  scrupulously  or religiously rather pursuing the Directions of the Will carefully preventing all Imbezelments and frequently meeting at their own Expence for the Dispatch of Business in the Execution of their Trust which worthy Example if imitated by other Trustees or Directors of charitable Benefactions who too often make a Property of their Trust would be of publick Emolument and singular Benefit to the Poor by rescuing charitable Devises from the Discouragement they now lie under and rendering unnecessary  the Trouble and Expence of applying for and suing out Commissions of Charitable Uses  The same charitable Lady to make Provision for the helpless Young as well as destitute Old has also bequeathed a considerable yearly Sum for the apprenticing of Ten or Twelve Children in which a Preference is to be given to such as were born in her Manors In the Management of which Trust another Set of Trustees act with the same commendable Uncorruptness and Integrity as the former  We next came to  Hungerford  a little Markettown situate in a Moorishplace remarkable only for being a great Thoroughfare to  Bath  and  Bristol  and for Plenty of Trout and Crayfish It is governed by the Lord of the Manor as Constable who is however chosen annually into that Office From this Town the antient Family of the Barons of  Hungerford  took their Name and Title The first of the Family was the first Speaker of the House of Commons in  Edward  III They possess'd a vast Estate this Way and in all the neighbouring Counties which was twice forfeited for their Attachment to the House of  Lancaster  This vast Estate fell by a Daughter to the famous Lord  Hastings  who was executed in the Reign of  Richard  III when  Howard  first Duke of  Norfolk  had a Grant of it from that Prince who falling with his Master in the Battle of  BosworthField  King  Henry  VII restored it with the Honour to a younger Branch of the  Hungerfords  who had joined him and shared in the Glory of that Victory But his Descendants suffer'd Death for Treason  Henry  VIII tho' Queen  Mary  restored them again He was the Third of the Family who died for Treason such Vicissitudes attended this noble Family and their great Estate  We pursued the great Road and arrived at  Newbury  situate in a most fruitful Plain and water'd by the River  Kennet  which is made navigable up to the Town which carries on a very great Trade in Malt  c  with  London  It is governed by a Mayor High Steward Aldermen and Burgesses The Streets are spacious and the Marketplace large where there is great Store of Corn sold and a Hall for the Business of the Corporation stands in it  Here is also a good Charityschool very well endow'd and this Place is noted for good Trout and Crayfish  Near this Town was a double Scene of Blood for here were Two obstinate Battles fought at different Times between the King's Army and the Parliament's King  Charles  being present at them both and both were fought almost upon the same Spot of Ground In these Two Battles it was observed by an experienced Soldier who served in the King's Army that the Generals on both Sides shewed the most exquisite Skill in the managing posting bringing up and drawing off their Troops and the Men fought with equal Bravery In the first of these Battles the Success was doubtful and both Sides claim'd the Advantage in the last the King's Army had apparently the worst of it and yet the King in a very few Days with a great Body of Horse brought off his Cannon which he had in the Close of the Battle thrown into  Dunington  Castle and carried them away to  Oxford  the Head Quarter of his Army and this he did in the Sight of the victorious Army facing them at the same time with a Body of Six thousand Horse they on the other hand not thinking fit to draw out to attack him That Retreat in point of Honour was equal to a Victory and gave new Courage as well as Reputation to the King's Troops  Part of  Newbury  is also known by the Name of  Spinhamlands  For it arose out of the Ruins of an old Town called  Spine  the Remains of which now join to  Newbury  in respect to which it was called  New Borough  and for Shortness  Newbury  It is noted among other Things for Two or Three good Inns where Travellers are well accommodated  This Town of  Newbury  was an antient Clothing Town tho' now little of that Business remains to it but it retains still a manufacturing Genius and the People are generally imployed in making Shalloon which tho' it be used only for the Lining and Insides of Mens Cloaths yet it becomes so generally worn both at home and abroad that it is increased to a Manufacture by itself and is more considerable than any single Manufacture of Stuffs in the Nation This imploys the Town of  Newbury  as also  Andover  a Town I have already described and many others in different Counties of  England    Here lived the famous  Jack of Newbury  the greatest Clothier that ever was in  England  having Looms at work in his own House He flourished in the Reign of  Henry  VIII and marched at the Head of of his own Men all cloath'd and maintain'd by himself to the Battle of  FloddenField  where he behav'd well He rebuilt Part of  Newbury  Church and the whole Tower of it This is One of the Two Legatee Towns as they were called in the Will of the famous Mr  Kenrick  who being the Son of a Clothier of  Newbury  and afterwards a Merchant in  London  left  l  to  Newbury  and  l  to  Reading  to encourage the Clothing Trade and to set the Poor at Work besides other Gifts of extraordinary Value to the Poor  This Gentleman's Will is to be seen at large in  Stow  's  Survey of London  to which I refer  What Improvement the Towns of  Newbury  and  Reading  have made of these great Sums I did not inquire into  Near  Newbury  the late Earl of  Craven  built a very stately Pile of Buildings for his own Dwelling called  Spine  but as it was never quite finished so I do not understand that his Lordship ever came to live in it and some Years ago it was by a sudden Fire burnt down to the Ground It was reported that that Lord built this magnificent Palace for such it really was at a Time when he had Hopes of marrying Madame Royale as she was then called  viz  the Queen of  Bohemia  Sister to King  Charles  I who then a Widow lived under the Shadow of the  English  Coutt but being frustrated in that View the Earl went no farther in his Building But his present Lordship has lately rebuilt this House and tho' not in so grand a manner as the former it is very commodious  Westward a little out of our Way we visited the Ruins of the Castle of  Donnington  just mention'd which was seated on the Brow of a high Hill washed by the little River  Lambourn  and had been the Seat of Sir  Geoffrey Chaucer  Father of  English  Poetry They shew us a Place here where in his Days as well as many Years since even down to the Memory of some of the Inhabitants now living flourished a great Oak call'd  Chaucer  's  Oak  where they very gravely tell you he used to sit and compose his Poems  We went forward to the Town of  Lambourn  so called from the River which runs down and falls into the  Kennet  near  Thatcham  It is situate on the Southside of  WhiteHorseHill  and has a Market This River is remarkable for being very low in Winter and high in Summer It goes off about  Michaelmas  and the sooner it goes the more plentiful say  the Inhabitants will that Year be This Town is likewise noted for the Birthplace or at least the Residence of the Poet  Sylvester  who celebrates the River in the following Lines  And little  Lambesbourn  All Summer long while all thy Sisters shrink  Then of thy Waters Thousands daily drink  Besides shed Water which in haste doth run  To wash the Feet of  Chaucer's Donnington  But while the rest are full unto the Top  All Summer long thou dost not shed a Drop  Nor send'st a Doit of needless Subsidy  To cram the  Kennet  's wantless Treasury  Before her Stores be spent and Springs be staid  Then then alone thou lend'st a lib'ral Aid  Teaching thy wealthy Neighbours mine of late  How when and where to right participate  Their Streams of Comfort to the Poor that pine  And not to grease the still too greasy Swine  Neither for Fame or Form when others do  To give a Morsel or a Mite or two  But sev'rally and of a selfly Motion  When others miss to give the most Devotion  At  Newbury  we quitted the high Road and being desirous to see something of the North of  Berkshire  we struck up to  Islip  which tho' but an inconsiderable little Town yet has a good weekly Market for Sheep  We passed Northeastward to  Wantage  a Town of some Antiquity pretty good and neat It is noted for the Birthplace of the renowned King  Alfred  and is watered by the  Och    From  Wantage  we advanced into the fine and fertile Vale of  WhiteHorse  which extends almost from  Farringdon  to  Abington  tho' not in a direct Line Looking South from the Vale we see a  Trench cut on the Side of a high green Hill in the Shape of a Horse and not ill done The Trench is about a Yard deep and fill'd almost up with Chalk so that at a Distance you see the exact Shape of a  WhiteHorse  so large as takes up near an Acre of Ground From this Figure the Hill is called  WhiteHorseHill  and the Vale below takes also its Name 'Tis said to be done in order to commemorate a signal Victory and some give it to the  Saxons  whose Device was and still is a white Horse Westward of this Vale lies  Ashbury  betwixt which and  Wantage  is a very large Camp on the Brow of a Hill 'tis single work'd and of a quadrangular Form which shews it a  Roman  Work  The neighbouring Parish to this  WhiteHorse  have a Custom annually at  Midsummer  to go and weed it in order to keep it in Shape and Colour and when they have done their Work they end the Day in Feasting and Meriment  We arrived at  Farringdon  noted for its pleasant Situation on a Hill It has a very good Market weekly and is very neat and clean In this Place may be seen the Ruins of a Castle built by  Robert  Earl of  Gloucester  in King  Stephen  's Reign Here was also a Priory of  Cistertian  Monks The Church is large and handsome  From hence we went partly by the Forest to  Abingdon  a handsome wellbuilt Town where the Assizes and Sessions and other publick Meetings of the County are generally held Here is a stately Markethouse built on high Pillars over which is a large Hall for the Assizes The Town consists of several wellpaved Streets which centre in an open and spacious Place where the Cornmarket is kept They make great Quantities of Malt here and send it up by Barges to  London  Here is a good FreeSchool and also a CharitySchool  The Corporation is governed by a Mayor Two Bailiffs and Nine Aldermen  It is an antient Town and was famed for Religious Houses in the Time of the antient  Britons  It was also famous for having several Synods held there and for one of the noblest Abbeys in the Kingdom founded as it is said by  Heane  Nephew to  Cissa  Father to King  Ina Henry  I was educated in this Monastery  We next came to  Wallingford  called by the antient  Britons Gwal Hen  i e  Old Fort  a Place of great Figure as well in their Days and of the  Romans  as of the  Saxons  and  Danes  the last of whom destroyed it in but it was soon rebuilt and esteemed a Borough in the  Confessor  's Time It has been defended by a strong Castle which has been long since demolish'd It is still a large wellbuilt Town has a good Marketplace and Townhall where the Assizes have been sometimes held and a Quartersession for the Borough always It has still Two Churches standing but one was very much damaged in the Civil Wars when Two others here were altogether destroyed It has Two weekly Markets and is govern'd by a Mayor Burgesses  c  Here we cross'd the  Thames  into  Oxfordshire  and leaving  Wathington  a little inconsiderable Markettown on the Left we fell down thro'  Netlebed  likewise a Town of little Note to  Henley upon Thames  a very antient Town the Name being deriv'd from the  British  Word  Henlley  i e  Old Place  It was formerly part of the Estate of the Barons of  Hungerford  mentioned before It is now a Corporation of great Account govern'd by a Warden Burgesses and other Officers It has a considerable Corn and Maltmarket The Inhabitants are mostly Maltsters Mealmen and Bargemen who by carrying Corn and Timber to  London  get a gainful Living and inrich  the Neighbourhood It has a good Free Grammar School and also a Charity School liberally endow'd for teaching cloathing and apprenticing several poor Children Here is also an Almshouse but meanly endowed for tho' there are not above Six or Seven Persons in it they have but Sixpence apiece weekly for their Allowance  We return'd over a wooden Bridge into  Berkshire  and as  Thatcham Woolhampton  and  Theal  which lie between  Newbury  and  Reading  are at present noted only for being great Thoroughfare Towns and full of Inns we went no further back than  Reading    Reading  is so called from the  British  Word  Rhedin  i e  Fern  which formerly grew in great Quantity there It is a very large and wealthy Town handsomly built the Inhabitants rich and driving a very great Trade The Town is situated on the River  Kennet  but so near the  Thames  that the largest Barges which they use may come up to the Town Bridge where they have Wharfs to load and unload them Their chief Trade is by this Waternavigation to and from  London  tho' they have necessarily a great Trade into the Country for the Consumption of the Goods which they bring by their Barges from  London  and particularly Coals Salt Grocery Wares Tobacco Oils and all heavy Goods  They send from hence to  London  by these Barges very great Quantities of Malt and Meal and these are the Two principal Articles of their Loadings Some of those Barges are so large that I was told they bring a Thousand or Twelve hundred Quarters of Malt at a time which according to the ordinary Computation of Tonnage in the Freight of other Vessels is from a Hundred to an Hundred and Twenty Ton dead Weight  They also send very great Quantities of Timber from  Reading  for  Berkshire  being a wellwooded  County and the River  Thames  a convenient Conveyance for the Timber they transport the largest and fairest of the Timber to  London  which is generally bought by the Shipwrights in the River for the building MerchantShips The like Trade of Timber is carried on at  Henley  abovementioned and at  Maidenhead  of which in its Place  A large Manufacture of SailCloth was set up in  Reading  by the late Sir  Owen Buckingham  LordMayor of  London  and many of the poor People were profitably imployed in it but Sir  Owen  dying and his Son being unhappily kill'd in a Duel a little while after that Manufacture died also  Here is however still a Remnant of the Woollen Manufacture which was once carried on in it to a very considerable Degree and this Town as well as  Newbury  has injoy'd the abovementioned Legacies of Mr  Kenrick  to set the Poor at Work and incourage the Clothing Trade  viz    l  Mr  Camden  's Continuator says there were once MasterClothiers in this one Town but now they are almost all gone During the Civil Wars in  England  this Town was strongly fortified and the Remains of the Bastions and other Works are still to be seen  There are Three Churches built of Flint and square Stones in the quincunx Fashion with tall Towers of the same Here are also Two large Meetinghouses besides that of the Quakers  Camden  calls it a little City it is said to contain about People including a little Hamlet at the Bridge over the  Thames  Archbishop  Laud  was born in this Town  It was formerly noted for a very famous Abbey and other Religious Foundations The Abbey stood in a charming Situation and large Ruins of it are still visible built of Flint the Walls which remain are about Eight Feet thick tho' the Stone that  faced them is gone What is left is so hard cemented that the Labour in separating them would not be answer'd by their Use There are many Remnants of arch'd Vaults a good Height above Ground whereon stood as may be presum'd the Hall Lodgings  c  The Abbey Gatehouse is yet pretty intire  This was built by King  Henry  I on an old Abbey formerly erected by a  Saxon  Lady That Prince was buried in it with his Queen but their Monuments are lost in the Ruins of the Place and nowhere to be found  There was a famous old Castle long since demolished  The Empress  Maud  Daughter of  Henry  I was also buried here but her Monument is lost as well as the others It bore this Inscription as we are assur'd  Magna ortu majorque viro sed maxima partu  Hic jacet  Henrici  filia sponsa parens  Thus translated  Illustrious in Descent in Marriage more  But noblest in her Offspring's Royal Pow'r  Great  Henry  's Daughter Parent Wife deplore  The deceas'd Earl  Cadogan  who was created Baron of  Reading  by his late Majesty King  George  I in built a fine large House at  Caversham  near  Reading  which his Successor the present Lord  Cadogan  thought fit to reduce to a smaller and more convenient Size as less regarding the outward Glare of Magnificence than Use and Convenience  At  Reading  in the Year began the universal Alarm that spread over the whole Kingdom almost at the same time of the  Irish  being coming to cut every body's Throats which was carried from  Town to Town by Peoples Fears and Terrors aggravated by the Menaces of an  Irish  Detachment of Soldiers who were beat out of  Reading  by the  Dutch  and prevented taking the Quarters they intended at  Maidenhead Colebrook Stanes  c  It is impossible to express the Consternation of the People all over  England  on this Occasion for the terrible Story spread like the Undulations of the Water in a Pond when a flat Stone is cast upon the Surface all over the Kingdom as I have said in one Day for Fear gave Wings to the News no Post could carry it as it flew from Town to Town and still every Messenger had Two Articles with him Not that such and such Towns  were to be  burnt and plundered by them but that they  were already  burnt And that the  Irish  were at their Heels to do the like there And the Service this Report did to the Cause of the Revolution is hardly to be imagined  Twyford  is about Five Miles East of  Reading  and is only noted like  Theale  and the other Towns beyond  Reading  for its Number of Inns for the Accommodations of Carriers  c  Just beyond  Theale  is  Inglefield  where King  Ethetwolf  routed the  Danes    From  Reading  I went to  Great Marlow  in  Buckinghamshire  which though not in the direct Road yet lying on the Banks of the River  Thames  is proper enough to be spoken of and is particularly worth Notice for several Things  It is a Town of very great Imbarkation on the  Thames  not so much for Manufactures wrought here for the Trade of the Town is chiefly in  Bonelace  but for Goods brought from the neighbouring Towns a very great Quantity of Malt and Meal particularly being brought hither from  High Wickham  which is one of the greatest Cornmarkets on  this Side of  England  and lies on the Road from  London  to  Oxford    Between  High Wickham  and  Marlow  is a little River called the  Loddon  on which are a great many Cornmills and some Papermills the first of these grind and dress the Wheat and then the Meal is sent to  Marlow  and put on board the Barges for  London  and the second make great Quantities of ordinary Printingpaper  On the  Thames  just by the Side of this Town tho' on the other Bank are Three very remarkable Mills called the  TempleMills  or the  BrassMills  for making  Bisham  Abbey  Battery Work  as they call it  viz  Brass Kettles and Pans  c  of all Sorts And these Works were attended with no small Success 'till in the Year they made a Bubble of it and then it ran the Fate of all the Bubbles at that time  Next to these are Two Mills which are both of an extraordinary Kind one for making of Thimbles a Work which performs to Admiration and another for pressing of Oyl from Rape and Flaxseed both which turn to very good Account to the Proprietors  Hither is also brought down a vast Quantity of Beech Wood which grows in  Buckinghamshire  more plentifully than in any other Part of  England  and from whence the County itself derives its Name  At  Bisham  overagainst this Town was formerly an Abbey and the Remains of it are still to be seen The Estate belong'd once to the  Knights Templars  and since came to the antient Family of  Hobby  whereof Sir  William Hobby  and Sir  Edward Hobby  are noted in our Histories the latter as having been imploy'd by Queen  Elizabeth  in the most important foreign Negotiations as a learned Man and great Antiquary Their Monuments with those of their Ladies and Children are in the little Church of  Bisham  and well worth seeing The Seat of the Family is now in  Dorsetshire  but hither they are generally all brought when they die to be buried with their Ancestors  A little higher on the same Side of the River is  Hurley  an antient Seat of the Lord  Lovela  and all the Male Branches of the Family b  g extinct it came by the Daughter and Heires  o S  r  H  nry Johnson  of  Blackwall  near  Ratcliffe  who originally was only a Shipwright or Masterbuild  r at the great Yard and Dock there of which I shall speak in their Place This Lady left only one Daughter married to the late Earl of  Strafford    From hence we fell with the  Thames  into  Maidenhead  and so came into the  London  Road again It is an antient Corporation under the Government of a High Steward a Mayor a Steward and Ten Aldermen out of which they annually elect Two Bridgmasters to look after the large Timberbridge which here crosses the  Thames  for the Repair of which the Town has Three Trees annually allow'd them out of  Windsor  Forest The Mayor for the Time being is Clerk of the Market and Coroner and he and the Mayor for the preceding Year and the Steward are Justices of the Peace they chuse yearly Two Macebearers The Town is a large Thoroughfare with many good Inns in it and has a good Market weekly It lies in Two Parishes one Part of it is in  Bray  famous of old for its conforming Vicar to all Times Changes and Seasons  As soon as you are out of  Maidenhead  you see  Cliefden  on your Left where  George  Duke of  Buckingham  began a magnificent and delightful Palace which the late Earl of  Orkney  afterwards purchased of the Family and finish'd and now has the Honour to be the Summer Retreat of his Royal Highness  Frederick  Prince of  Wales    We came to  Slough  a Village Five Miles East of  Maidenhead  which consists almost intirely of Inns They seem to vie with one another and 'tis wonderful how they all subsist and especially as they are opposed by the Two famous new ones of the  Castle  and  Windmill  a little Way out of  Slough  which are much more delightfully situated and have better Accommodations  Here we left the Road and turn'd to the Right and soon arriv'd at  Eton  where there is the finest School for Grammar Learning that is in  Britain  or perhaps in  Europe    The Buildings except the great Schoolroom are antient the Chapel  Gothick  but all has been repaired at a very great Expence out of the College Stock within these few Years and a noble Library built for the Reception of Books  In the great Court a fine Statue is erected to the Honour of the Founder by Dr  Godolphin  late Dean of St  Paul  's and Provost of this College and the Library has receiv'd several considerable Benefactions particularly very lately the fine Collection of  Richard Topham    Esq  formerly Keeper of the Records in the  Tower  which was presented to it by the late excellent Lord Chief Justice  Reeves  And before that a Collection of Books valu'd at  l  was left to it by Dr  Waddington  late Bishop of  Chichester    The Gardens which extend from the College down almost to the Bank of the  Thames  are well planted and kept  This College was founded by King  Henry  VI a Prince munificent in his Gifts for the Incouragement of Learning Witness besides this noble Foundation that of  King  's College in  Cambridge  to which the Scholars of  Eton  are annually removed and which had it been perfected as he designed it would have been the noblest Building of the Kind in the  World But his Successor and Deposer K  Ed  IV took several Manors from  Eton  College and bestow'd them on their Neighbours at  Windsor  and had intended to have taken from them still more had not the celebrated  Jane Shore  solicited in their Behalf  This College has a settled Revenue of about  l per Ann  and maintains a Provost a Viceprovost who is also a Fellow Six other Fellows and Scholars on the Foundation besides a full Choir for the Chapel with necessary Officers and Servants The School is divided into the upper and lower and each into Three Classes each School has One Master and each Master Four Assistants or Ushers None are received into the upper School till they can make  Latin  Verses and have a tolerable Knowledge of the  Greek  In the lower School the Children are received very young and are initiated into all Schoollearning Besides the Seventy Scholars upon the Foundation there are always abundance of Children generally speaking of the best Families and of Persons of Distinction who are boarded in the Houses of the Townsmen and within the College  The Number of Scholars instructed here used to be from to but has not been for Seven Years past more than  The Election of Scholars for the University out of this School is made annually on the First  Tuesday  in  August  In order to it Three Persons are deputed from  King  's College in  Cambridge viz  the Provost of that College and One Senior and One Junior Poser Fellows of the same who being join'd by the Provost the Viceprovost and the Head Master of  Eton  College call before them the Scholars of the upper Class and examining them in the several Parts of their Learning chuse out Twelve such as they think best qualified and enter them in a Roll or List for the University These Youths are not immediately removed from the School but must wait till  Vacancies fall in  King  's College and as such happen are then taken as they stand in Seniority in the Roll of Election  When a Scholar from  Eton  comes to  King  's College he is received upon the Foundation and pursues his Studies there for Three Years after which he claims a Fellowship unless forfeited by Marriage accepting of Ecclesiastick Preferments  c  according to the Terms of the Statutes  The Provost has a noble House and Garden besides the Use of the College Gardens at his Pleasure  Will you Sir excuse me here a few Lines to the Memory of the late excellent Lord Chief Justice  Reeves  beforementioned This worthy and eminent Lawyer had a Seat in this Town to which he constantly retired at the Close of every Term while he was at the Bar for he would never go the Circuit or attend the Court of Chancery and actually declined accepting of the high Office of a Judge while his Lady liv'd chusing rather to spend his Vacations in Retirement with his Family than either Honour or Profit yet he was pursued even here with Cases for his Opinion as being the greatest Lawyer of his Time and these were conveyed to him by his Clerk from his Chambers in the  Temple  and after he had answer'd them he would return them thither again without seeing the Practisers who left them  This Gentleman lay a long time undistinguish'd in his Profession under an invincible Modesty insomuch that he thought once of quitting the Bar but a lucky Occasion happening whereby he had an Opportunity to shew his great Parts and Learning he was soon taken Notice of and retain'd in every Cause of Moment but however confined himself intirely to the Courts of Law and chiefly to that of the King's Bench After the Death of his Wife he was prevailed with to ascend the Bench as a  Judge in the last Court which he accepted probably to alleviate and divert the Concern he was in for her Death He was afterwards made Lord Chief Justice of the Commonpleas in which Office he lived but Two Years His Death was a publick Loss and much lamented  I am now come to  Windsor  where I must for a while quit the Subject of Trade and Navigation in order to describe the most beautiful and most pleasantly situated Castle and Royal Palace in the whole Isle of  Great Britain    William the Conqueror  was the first of our  English  Monarchs who distinguish'd  Windsor  That Prince who delighted much in Hunting finding it a Situation highly proper for that Purpose and as he said of it a suitable Place for the Entertainment of Kings agreed with the Abbot of  Westminster  for an Exchange and so took Possession of it He built a Castle here and had several little Lodges or Huntinghouses in the Forest adjoining and frequently lodg'd for the Conveniency of his Sport in a House which the Monks before enjoyed near or in the Town of  Windsor  for the Town is much more ancient than the present Castle and was an eminent Pass upon the  Thames  in the Reign of the  Saxon  Kings  After him King  Edward  III taking an extreme Liking to that Place resolved to fix his Summer Residence here and accordingly laid out himself the Plan of that magnificent Palace which as to outward Form and Building we now see there for whatever has been done as to beautifying altering or amending the Inside and Apartments nothing has been added to the Building itself except that noble Terrace which runs under the North Front and leads to the Green on the Park at the East Side or End of it along which the fine Lodgings and Royal Apartments were at first built all the Northpart  being then taken up in Rooms of State and Halls for publick Balls  c  The House itself was indeed a Palace and without any Appearance of a Fortification but when the Building was brought on to the Slope of the Hill on the Town Side the King added Ditches Ramparts the Round Tower and several other Places of Strength and thence it was called a Castle  Such a Pride did this great King take in being the Founder of this sumptuous Building that when it was suggested to him that  William of Wickham  had assumed the Honour of it to himself it had like to have cost  William  all his Interest in the King's Favour which at that time was very great but the Prelate cleared himself by disavowing the Charge urging that all he protended to was to acknowlege That the Money and the Reputation he had gained by building that Castle for the King had been the making of him For it seems he had caused these Words  THIS MADE WICKHAM  to be cut in Stone in the inner Wall of the little Tower which from him is to this Day call'd  Winchester Tower    William of Wickham  whom I have beforementioned in my Account of  Winchester  was at that time the Architect of the Court and so well perform'd his Part that in all the Decorations and Ornaments which have been made since by succeeding Princes they have found no Occasion to add to or diminish any thing except it be to alter some small Matter at the Entrance to the great Staircase the Kitchen and Offices below Stairs and suchlike but the great North and East Fronts the Square of the inner Court the great Gates at the entering from the Town with the Round Tower and the  Walls annex'd are all standing in the very Form in which King  Edward  III left them  The only Addition in the Inside is a fine Equestrian Statue of King  Charles  II which stands over the great Well sunk as may be supposed in the first Building for the Supply of the Castle with Water and in which was an Engine for raising it notwithstanding the great Depth by very little Labour the Contrivance and Performance of Sir  Samuel Morland  an excellent Mechanick and Mathematician  On the Outside as I have said was added the Terrace Walk by Queen  Elizabeth  where she usually walked for an Hour every Day before her Dinner if not hindered by windy Weather to which she had a peculiar Aversion for she loved to walk in a mild calm Rain with an Umbrella over her Head  This is really a magnificent Work for as it is raised on a steep Declivity of the Hill it was necessarily cut down a very great Depth to bring the Foundation to a Flat equal to the Breadth which was to be formed above From the Foundation it was raised by solid Stone Work of a vast Thickness with cross Walls of Stone for banding the Front and preventing any Thrust from the Weight of Earth within  This noble Walk is covered with fine Gravel and has Cavities with Drains to carry off the Water so that not a Drop of Rain will rest on the Terrace but it is dry hard and fit to walk on immediately after the greatest Showers The Breadth of this Walk is very spacious on the North Side on the East Side it is narrower Neither  Versailles  nor any of the Royal Palaces in  France Naples  or  Rome  can shew any thing like this The Grand Seignior's Terrace in the outer Court of the  Seraglio  next the Sea is what I think comes the nearest and yet is  not equal to it if I may believe the Account of those who have seen it  At the Northeast Corner of this Terrace where it turns South to run on by the East Side of the Castle are Steps by which you go off upon the Plain of the Park which is kept smooth as a Carpet and on the Edge of which the Prospect of the Terrace is doubled by a Vista South over the Park and quite up to the great Park and towards the Forest Here also is a small Seat that will not contain above One or Two at most with an high Back and Cover for the Head which being fixed on a Pin of Iron or Brass the Persons who sit in it may easily turn it from the Wind however it may blow and enjoy a complete Calm This is said also to be Queen  Elizabeth  's Invention to avoid being ruffled with the Wind and it affords no less Shelter from the Sun  From this lofty Terrace the People within have an Egress to the Park and to a most beautiful Walk which neither King  Edward  III nor his Successors for some Hundreds of Years knew any thing of all their Prospect being from the Windows of the Castle  On that Side of the Building which looks out upon the Terrace are all the Royal Apartments those of King  Edward  III which were on the East Side being now allotted to great Officers of State  You mount into the Royal Apartments by several back Stairs but the publick Way is up a small Ascent to a Flat or Halfpace where there are two Entries of State by two large Staircases one on the Lefthand to the Royal Apartments and the other on the Right to  St George'shall  and the Royal Chapel  Before the Entrance to these on either Side you pass thro' the Guardchambers where you see the Walls furnished with Arms and the King's Yeomen of the Guard keep their Station These Rooms  lead as well to the fine Lodgings as to  St George'shall    In the Royal Lodgings there have been so many Alterations of Furniture that there can be no entering upon a particular Description In the Chimneypiece of one of these Apartments is a Piece of Needlework exquisitely fine performed as they say by the Queen of  Scots  during the Time of her Confinement in  Fotheringaycastle  There are several Family Pictures in the Chimneypieces and other Parts of those Lodgings which are very valuable  These Rooms look all out North towards the Terrace and over Part of the finest and richest Vale in the World which along the Course of the River  Thames  with very little Interruption reaches to and includes the City of  London  East and the City of  Oxford  West the River with a beautiful winding Stream gliding gently thro' the Middle of it and inriching by its Navigation both the Land and the People on every Side  It may be proper to say something of the Beauties and Ornaments of  St George'shall  tho' nothing can be said equal to what the Eye may be Witness to 'Tis surprising at the first Entrance to see at the Upperend the Picture of King  William  on Horseback under him an Ascent with Marble Steps a Balustrade and a half Pace which formerly was actually there with room for a Throne or Chair of State for the Sovereign to sit on when on publick Days he thought fit to appear in Ceremony  At the West End of the Hall is the Chapel Royal the neatest and finest of the Kind in  England  the carved Work is beyond any that can be seen in the Kingdom  After we had spent some Hours in viewing all that was curious on this Side we came down to the Dungeon or  Round Tower  which goes up a long but easy Ascent of Steps and is very high Here we  were obliged to deliver up our Swords but nowhere else tho' here is nothing curious The Governor or Constable's Lodgings are neatly furnished but nowise extraordinary  From this Tower you see  St Paul  's Cathedral at  London  very plainly  Coming down from hence we entered into the other Court where is the great Chapel of the Garter and the House or College for the poor Knights as they are called  I might go back here to the History of the Order of the Garter the Institution of which by King  Edward  III had its Original here but this is done so fully in other Authors that I shall only mention That this Order was not founded on the Countess of  Salisbury  's Garter as  Polydere Virgil  the most conceited and most erroneous Author that ever wrote of the  English  Affairs ridiculously asserts but on that martial King's own Garter which he gave as the Signal at the glorious Battle of  Cressi  as  St George  was given for the Word of the Day To commemorate which in Honour of his brave and warlike Son and of those Nobles and Gentlemen who shared with him in the Glory of that ever memorable Day he instituted this Order And here I can't forbear observing tho' intirely out of my way how fond we have ever been in following Foreigners in most Things even from the Coxcomb in Dress up to the Historian as is evident not only from this idle Story of the abovementioned Author prevailing among u  in particular and of his History in general but likewise of the Performance of a late Foreign Author of the Affairs and Transactions of this Country whereby the Translator and Undertake  to usher it out in  English  got at least  l  when it had nothing more but rather much less▪ to recommend it than any of our own  English  Histories  The following are the Names of the first Knights of this most Noble Order  King  Edward  III  The Black Prince  Henry  D of  Lancaster    Thomas  Earl of  Warwick    Peers Capitow de la Bouch  Ralph  Earl of  Stafford    W Montacute  E of  Salis  Roger Mortimer  Earl of  March    John de Lysle  Bartholomew Burghersh  John de Beauchamp  John de M  un  Hugh Courteney  Thomas Holland  John de Grey  Richard Fitz Simon  Miles Stapleton  Thomas Wale  Hugh Wortesley  Nele Loring  John Chandos  James d' Audeley  Otho Holland  Henry Eam  Sanchet Daubricourt  Walter Paveley  alias  Pevrell    These tho' not all Noblemen were however Men of great Characters and Stations either in the Army or in the Civil Administration and such as the Sovereign did not think it below him to make his Companions  The lower Court of the Castle although not so distinguished by Lodgings and Rooms of State is nevertheless particularly glorious for the fine Chapel of the Order a most beautiful and magnificent Work and which shews the Greatness not only of the Court in those Days but the Spirit and Genius of the magnanimous Founder The Chapel is not only fine within but the Workmanship without is extraordinary nothing so antient is to be seen so beautiful  King'sCollege  Chapel at  Cambridge  built by  Henry  VI and  Henry  VII's Chapel in  WestminsterAbbey  are fine Buildings but they are modern compared to this which was begun as by the inscribed Dates upon the Walls appears in the Year  The Coats of Arms and the various Imagery and other Ornaments both inside and outside not only of the King but of several of the first Knights Companions are wonderfully finished and the Work has stood out against the Injury of Time to Admiration  'Tis observable that King  Edward  owns this Chapel was begun by his Ancestors and some think it was by King  Edward  I and that he himself was baptized in it and there was a Castle built by  William the Conqueror  also As to the Chapel which was then called a Church or a Convent King  Edward  III did not pull down the old Building intirely but he added all the Choir to the first Model and several other proper Parts for the Purposes intended as Houses and handsome Apartments for the Canons Dignitaries and other Persons belonging to the Church which are generally situated on the North Side of the Square out of Sight or rather skreened from the common View by the Church itself which Dwellings are notwithstanding very good and well accommodated for the Persons who are Possessors of them then the King finished it in the Manner we now see it As for the old Castle the Building of  William the Conqueror  the King pulled it down to the Foundation forming a new Building according to the present Plan and which stood as above to the Time of King  Charles  II without any Alteration  The Establishment for this Chapel was very considerable by the Donation of divers Subjects before it was set apart to be the Chapel of the Order the Duke of  Suffolk  in particular as appears in  Dugdale  's  Monasticon  gave near Acres of Land Manors Messuages and Tofts and several Advowsons of Churches to it which with other Gifts afterwards made the Revenue above  l  a Year in those Days which was a prodigious Sum as Money went at that Time  In the Choir are the Stalls for the Knights of the Order with a Throne for the Sovereign also Stalls in the Middle of it for the poor KnightsPensioners who live in their House or Hospital on the South Side of the Square or Court in which the Church stands  Here are to be seen the Banners of the Knights who now enjoy the Honour of the Garter When they die those Banners are taken down and the Coat of Arms of the deceased Knight set up in the Place allotted for those Arms over the same Stall so those Coats of Arms are a living History or rather a Record of all the Knights that ever have been since the first Institution of the Order and how they succeeded one another by which it appears that Kings Emperors and Sovereign Princes have not thought it below them to accept of the Honour of being Knights Companions of the Order while at the same time it must be noted to the Honour of the  English  Crown that our Kings have never thought fit to accept of any of their Orders abroad of what Kind soever whereas there is an Account in the Registry of the Order that there are reckoned up of this most Noble Company  Emperors of  Germany    Kings of  Sweden    Kings of  Denmark    Kings of  Prussia    Kings of  Spain    Princes of  Orange    Kings of  France    Peers of  France    A King of  Scotland  besides  James  VI  Kings of  Portugal    A King of  Poland    Kings of  Naples    A King of  Arragon    Infants of  Portugal    A Prince of  Denmark    A Bishop of  Osnabrug    Princes of  Lunenburg    An Elector of  Brandenburg    Electors  Palatine    Electors of  Saxony    Dukes of  Lorrain    Dukes of  Wirtenberg    Dukes of  Holstein    Grandees of  Spain    Dukes  de Urbino    A Duke of  Savoy    A Duke of  Saxe Gotha    A Prince of  Hesse  c  Besides these Foreign Princes there is a little  Galaxy  of  English  Nobility the Flower of so many Courts and so many Ages to whose Families the Ensigns of the Order have been an Honour and who are not the least Glory this Order has to boast of But as to the List of the present Knights that being subject to Fluctuation comes not within my Design in this Letter  Several Kings and Persons of high Rank have been buried also in this Chapel as  Edward  IV and  Charles  I Here also is the Family Buryingplace of the Dukes of  Beauford  who are a natural Branch of the Royal Family of  Lancaster    All the Ceremonies observed here in the Instalment of the Knights are so perfectly set down in Mr  Ashmole  's History of the  Order of the Garter  that nothing can be said but what must be a Copy from him  As the upper Court and Building are fronted with the fine Terrace so the lower Court where this beautiful Chapel stands is incompassed with a very high Wall which goes round the Westend of the Court to the Gate and looking South leads into the Town as the Gate of the upper Court looks likewise Southeast into the little Park  The Parks about  Windsor  are very agreeable and spacious the little Park as it is called is above Miles round the great one and the Forest above The first is particular to the Court the others are open for Riding Hunting and taking the Air for any Gentlemen that please  The Lodges in those Parks may be called Palaces were they not eclipsed by the Palace itself They have been beautified by the noble Persons to whom the Post of Rangers has been generally assigned who having been inriched by other Advancements Honours and profitable Imployments thought nothing too much to lay out to adorn their Apartments  in a Place wherein it was so much to their Honour as well as Convenience to reside such is the Lodge belonging once to Admiral  Churchill  the Duchess of  Marlborough  and others  We left  Windsor  and struck again into the  London  Road at  Colebrook  and passed over the Heath and thro' the Town of  Hounslow Brentford Hamersmith  and  Kensington  into  London    And here I shall conclude this Letter with assuring you that I am Sir  Your humble Servant  LETTER II CONTAINING A Description of the City of  LONDON  as taking in the City of  Westminster  Borough of  Southwark  and the Buildings circumjacent  SIR  _I Am now to describe the City of LONDON and Parts adjacent a Work infinitely difficult to be perform'd in the narrow Compass of a Letter since we see it so fully takes up Two large Volumes in  Folio  which yet if I may venture to give an Opinion of it is very imperfectly executed and has imploy'd since another very large one in  Folio  written by Mr  W Maitland  F R S which has much more Merit than the Two Volumes and contains many Things needful to be known by the Curious which are incompatible with the Brevity to which our narrow Limits confine us  LONDON as a City only and as its Walls and Liberties line it out might indeed be viewed in a smaller Compass than what we propose to consider it in for when I speak of  London  in the modern  Acceptation I take in all that vast Mass of Buildings reaching from  Blackwall  in the East to  Tothillfields  in the West and extended in an unequal Breadth from the Bridge or River in the South to  Islington  North and from  Peterboroughhouse  on the  Bankside  in  Westminster  to  Cavendishsquare  and all the new Buildings by and beyond  Grosvenor  and  Hanover Squares  to the  Brentford  Road one way to the  Acton  Road another a Prodigy of Buildings that nothing in the World does or ever did surpass except old  Rome  in  Trajan  's Time when the Walls of that City were Miles in Compass and the Number of Inhabitants Souls  London  as to its Figure must be owned to be very irregular as it is stretch'd out in Buildings just at the Pleasure of every Undertaker of them and as the Convenience of the People directs whether for Trade or otherwise This has given it a very confused Face and made it uncompact and unequal being properly neither long or broad round or square whereas the City of  Rome  was in a manner round with very few Irregularities in its Shape  One sees  London  including the Buildings on both Sides the Water in some Places Three Miles broad as from  St George  's in  Southwark  to  Shoreditch  in  Middlesex  or Two Miles as from  Peterboroughhouse  to  Montaguehouse  and in some Places not half a Mile as in  Wapping  and less in  Rotherhith    We see several Villages formerly standing as it were in the Country and at a great Distance now joined to the Streets by continued Buildings and more making haste to meet in the like manner for Example    Deptford  This Town was formerly reckoned at least Two Miles from  Rotherhith  and that over the Marshes too a Place unlikely ever to be inhabited and yet now by the Increase of Buildings in that Town itself and the many Streets erected at  Rotherhith  and by the Docks and Buildingyards on the Riverside which stand between both the Town of  Deptford  and the Streets of  Rotherhith  are in a manner joined and the Buildings daily increasing so that  Deptford  may be reckoned a Part of the great Mass and infinitely full of People also and were the Town of  Deptford  now separated and rated by itself I believe it contains more People and stands upon more Ground than the City of  Wells    The Town of  Islington  on the Northside of the City is in like manner joined to the Streets of  London  excepting one small Field and which is in itself so small that there is no Doubt but in a very few Years they will be intirely joined And the same may be said  Of  Mileend  on the East End of the Town    Newingtonbutts  in  Surrey  reaches out her Hand North and is so joining to  Southwark  that it cannot now be properly called a Town by itself but a kind of Suburb to the Borough and if as once was talk'd of  St George'sfields  should be built into Squares and Streets  Newington Lambeth  and the  Borough  would make but one  Southwark    That  Westminster  is in a fair way to shake Hands with  Chelsea  as  St Gyles  's is with  Marybone  and  Great Russelstreet  by  Montaguehouse  with  Tottenhamcourt  is very evident and yet all these put together may still be called  London  Whither will this City then extend and where must a Circumvallation Line of it be placed  I have as near as I could caused a Measure to be taken of this mighty Body and for the Satisfaction of your Curiosity I have here given as accurate a Description of it as I can do in so narrow a Compass or without drawing a Plan of the Places  As I am forced in many Places to take in some unbuilt Ground so I have on the other hand been obliged to leave a great many whole Streets of Buildings  out of my Line so that I have really not stretched my Calculations to make it seem bigger than it is nor is there any Occasion for it  A  LINE  of Measurement drawn about all the continued Buildings of the City of  London  and Parts adjacent including  Westminster  and  Southwark  c  NB  I shall sum up by Figures  c  the Particulars at last  The Line begins for the  MIDDLESEX  Side of the  BUILDINGS  AT  Peterboroughhouse  the farthest House West upon the River  Thames  and runs Northwest by West by the Marshes to  Tothillfields  and passing by the  Neathouses  and  Arnold  's Brewhouse ends at  Chelsea  Road Measured  Mile    Furlongs    Rods    Then allowing an Interval from  Buckinghamhouse  cross the Park about one Furlong and half to the Corner of my Lord  Godolphin  's GardenWall the Line goes North behind the Stableyard Buildings and behind  Parkplace  and on the Parkwall behind the Buildings on the West Side of  St James'sstreet  to the Corner in  Soho  or  Piccadilly  then crossing the Road goes along the North Side of the Road West  Hydepark  Gate  Mile    Furlongs    Rods    Then the Line turns Northeast by East and taking in the Buildings and Streets called  Mayfair  holds on East till the new Streets formed out of  Hydehouse  Garden cause it to turn away North a Point West reaching to  Tyburnroad  a little to the East of the great Mother Conduit then it goes North and crossing the Road takes in the West Side of  Cavendishsquare  and the Streets adjoining  and leaving  Marybone  goes away East till it reaches to  Hampsteadroad  near a little Village called  Tottenhamcourt    Miles    Furlongs    Rods    From  Tottenhamcourt  the Line comes in a little South to meet the  Bloomsbury  Buildings then turning East runs behind  Montague  and  Southampton  Houses to the Northeast Corner of  Southamptonhouse  then crossing the Path meets the Buildings called  Queen'ssquare  then turning North till it comes to the Northwest Corner of the Square thence it goes away East behind the Buildings on the North Side of  Ormondstreet  till it comes to  Lamb's Conduit    Mile    Furlong    Rods    Here the Line turns South and indents to the Corner of  Bedfordrow  and leaving some few Houses with the Cockpit and Bowlinggreen goes on the Back of  Gray'sinn  Wall to  Gray'sinnlane  then turns on the Outside of the Buildings which are on the West Side of  Gray'sinnlane  going North to the Stone's End when turning East it passes to the  New River  Bridge without  Liquorpondstreet  so taking in the  Coldbath  and the  Beargarden  but leaving out  A large Mass of Buildings has been erected since our Author drew this Line consisting of many Streets and Passages the whole  Coldbathfields  being built upon quite up to  Sir John Oldcastle's    Sir John Oldcastle's  and the  Spaw  goes on East by the  Duckingpond  to the End of  New Bridewell  and crossing the  Fairfield  comes into the  Islington  Road by the Distiller's House formerly Justice  Fuller  's  Mile    Furlongs    Rods    Here to take in all the Buildings which join  Islington  to the Streets the Line goes North on the East Side of the Road to the  Turk'shead  Alehouse then turning Northwest passes to the  New River  House but leaving it to the West passes by  Sadler'swells  from thence to  Busby'shouse  and keeping on the West Side of  Islington  till it comes opposite to  Canburyhouselane  turns into the Road and passes  South almost to the Lane which turns East down to the lower Street but then turns East without the Houses and goes to the  Cowkeeper  's in the lower Street crossing the Road and thro' the  Cowkeeper  's Yard into  Froglane  then turning West on the South Side of the Town just without the Buildings joins again to the Buildings on the West Side of  Wood'sclose  passing behind the  Sheepmarket  Wall  Miles    Furlongs    Rods    From  Wood'sclose  the Line goes due East to  Mountmill  where leaving several Buildings to the North it passes on crossing all the Roads to  Bricklane  to the North Side of the great new Square in  Oldstreet  and taking in the  Pesthouse  Wall turns South at the Northeast Corner of the said Wall to  Oldstreet  Road then going away East till it meets the Buildings near  Hoxtonsquare  it turns North to the Northwest Corner of the Wall of  Ask  's Hospital then sloping Northeast it passes by  Pimlico  the  Cyderhouse  and the two Walls to the North End of  Hoxton  when it turns East and inclosing the Gardenwalls comes into the  Ware  Road just at the  King'shead  in the New Buildings by the  Land of Promise    Miles    Rods    From the  King'shead  the Line turns South running to the Stone's End in  Shoreditch  then turning East it takes in a Buryingground and some Buildings in the  Hackney  Road when sloping Southeast by South it goes away by the  Virginiahouse  to a great Brewhouse and then still more East to the Back of  Wheelerstreet  and then East by South to  Bricklane  crossing which it goes away East towards  Bethnalgreen  but then turning short South it goes towards  Whitechapel Mount  but being intercepted by new Streets it goes quite up to the South End of the  Dogrow  at  Mileend    Mile    Furlongs    Rods    From the  Dogrow  the Line crosses the Road and takes in a Hamlet of Houses called  Stepney  and coming back West to the Street's End at  Whitechapel Mill  goes away South by the  Hoghouses  into  Churchlane  and to  Ragfair  when turning again East it continues in a strait Line on the North Side of  Ratcliff Highway  till it comes almost to the farthe  Glasshouses  then turning North it surrounds all  Stepney  and  Stepneycausway  to  Mileend  Road then turning East again and afterwards South comes back to the new Streets on the North Side of  Limehouse  and joining the Marsh comes down to the Waterside at the Lower Shipwright Dock in  Limehousehole    Miles    Furlongs    Rod    The Particulars of the  Middlesex  Side put together are as follows  viz     Miles  Furl  Rods                                                                          Total        NB  This Line leaves out all the North Side of  Mileend  Town from the End of the  Dogrow  to the  Jews  BuryingGround which is all built also all the North Part of the  Dogrow  and all  Bethnalgreen  also  Poplar  and  Blackwall  which are indeed contiguous a Trifle of Ground excepted and very populous  For the  Southwark  Side of the Buildings the Line is as follows  HAving ended the Circumference of the  Middlesex  Building at  Limehouse  and the Street extending towards  Poplar  the Hamlets of  Poplar  and  Blackwall  tho' very near contiguous in Buildings being excluded I allow an Interval of two Miles from  Poplar  cross the  Isle of Dogs  and over the  Thames  to the Lower Watergate at  Deptford  and tho' in measuring the Circumference of all Cities the River where any such runs thro' Part of the Buildings is always measured yet that I may not be said to stretch the Extent of the Buildings which I include in this Account I omit the River from  Limehouse  to  Deptford  where if included it ought to begin and begin my Line as above  From the said Watergate at  Deptford  the Line goes East to the Corner next the  Thames  where the Shipwright's Yard now is and where I find a continued Range of Buildings begins by the Side of a little Creek or River which runs into the  Thames  there and reaches quite up the said River to the Bridge in the great  Kentish  Road and over the Street there taking in the South Side of the Street to the West Corner of the Buildings in that Street and then measuring down on the West Side of the long Street which runs to the  Thames  Side till you come to the new Street which passes from  Deptford  to  Rotherhith  then turning to the Left passing on the Backside of the  King's Yard  to Mr  Evelin  's House including the new Church of  Deptford  and all the new Streets or Buildings made on the Fields Side which are very many this amounts in the Whole to  Miles    Furlong    Rods    From Mr  Evelin  's Gardengate the Line goes Northwest taking in all the new Docks and Yards the  Redhouse  and several large Streets of Houses which have been lately built and by which the said Town of  Deptford  is effectually joined to the Buildings reaching from  Cuckoldspoint  Eastward and which are carried out as if  Rotherhith  stretched forth its Arm to embrace  Deptford  then for some Length  Rotherhith  continues narrow till you come to  Churchstreet  where several Streets are also lately built South and others parallel with the Street till gradually the Buildings thicken and extend farther and farther to the South and South by East till they cross over the East End of  Horslydown  to  Bermondsey  Church and thence East to the Sign of the  World'send  overagainst the great Fort being the Remains of the Fortifications drawn round these Parts of  Southwark  in the late Civil Wars This Extent is by Computation Four Miles but being measured as the Streets indented the Circuit proved  Miles    Furlongs    Rods    From this Fort to the Corner of  Longlane  and thro'  Longlane  to the  Lock  at the End of  Kentstreet  is  Mile    Furlongs    Rods    From the Corner of  Kentstreet  to the Town of  Newingtonbutts  drawing the Line behind all the Buildings as they stand and round the said Village of  Newington  to the  Haberdashers  Almshouses and thence by the Road to the Windmill at  Blackman street  is  Miles    Furlongs    Rods    From the Windmill crossing  St George'sfields  on the Back of the  Mint  to the  Fighting Cocks  thence to the  Restoration Gardens  and thence on the Outside of all the Buildings to  Lambethwells  and on to  Vauxhall  Bridge overagainst the other Fort of the old Fortifications being just the same Length that those old Fortifications extended tho' infinitely fuller of Buildings This last Circuit measures  Miles    Furlongs    Rods    The Particulars of the  Southwark  Side put together  The Town of  Greenwich  which may indeed be said to be contiguous to  Deptford  might be also called a Part of the Measurement but I omit it as I have the Towns of  Chelsea  and  Knightsbridge  on the other Side tho' the latter actually joins the Town and the other as also  Kensington  very nearly  are as follow  viz     Miles  Furl  Rods                                                   Middlesex  Side        Total        Were it possible to reduce all these Buildings to a compact Situation 'tis generally thought that the whole Body so put together allowing the necessary Ground which they now imploy for the several Trades in the Outparts such as the Buildingyards by the River for Shipwrights Tanners Yards Dyers Whitsters  c  would take up Miles in Circumference very compactly built  The Guesses that are made at the Number of Inhabitants have been variously formed Mr  Maitland  abovementioned  Anno  computes that within the Walls and the Bars as I may say it contains but Sir  William Petty  famous for his Political Arithmetick supposed the City at his last Calculation to contain a Million of People and this he judges from the Number of Births and Burials but he must take in a greater Compass than Mr  Maitland  to make up this Number and according to this Rule as well by what is well known of the  Increase of the said Births and Burials as of the prodigious Increase of Buildings it may be very reasonable to conclude the present Number of Inhabitants  within the Circumference I have mentioned in my Line  to amount to about Souls  The Government of this great Mass of Building and of such a vast collected Body of People tho' it consists of various Parts is perhaps the best regulated that any City can pretend to and of late Years it boasts of several new Regulations as to Beggars Lights Pavements  c  which turn out greatly to its Advantage  The Government of the City of  London  in particular and abstractedly considered is by the LordMayor Twentyfour Aldermen Two Sheriffs the Recorder and Common Council but the Jurisdiction of these is confined to that Part only which they call the City and its Liberties which are mark'd out except the  Borough  by the Walls and the Bars as they are called  Besides this the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of  London  have a Right Presidial in  Southwark  and hold frequent Courts at  St Maryhill  in the  Borough  they are also Conservators of the Bridge and the Bridge itself is their particular Jurisdiction  Also the Lord Mayor  c  is Conservator of the River  Thames  from  Stanes  Bridge in  Surrey  and  Middlesex  to the River  Medway  in  Kent  and as some insist up the  Medway  to  Rochester  Bridge  The Government of the Outparts is by Justices of the Peace and by the Sheriffs of  London  who are likewise Sheriffs of  Middlesex  and the Government of  Westminster  is by a Highbailiff constituted by the Dean and Chapter to whom the Civil Administration is committed and who presides in Elections of Parliament for the City of  Westminster  and returns the Candidates who are chosen  The remaining Part of  Southwark  Side where the City Jurisdiction does not obtain is governed also by a Bench of Justices and their proper substituted Peaceofficers excepting out of this the Privileges of the  Marshalseas  or of the  Marshal's Court  the Privilege of the  Marshal  of the  King'sbench  and the like  That I may observe some Method in the Description of this noble Metropolis and avoid Repetitions I will divide my Subject into the following Branches  I I will give a brief Account of what the City was before the Fire and how improved when rebuilt and within a few Years after it  II Of the prodigious Increase of Buildings within our own Memory down to the Year  III Of the Publick Offices and City Corporations  IV Of the Mansionhouse and other most noted Edifices Structures and Squares in and about  London    V Of the principal Hospitals and other charitable Institutions in about  London    VI Of the Churches of  London  and  Westminster Southwark  c  VII Of  St James  's Palace the Parliamenthouse  Westminsterhall  c  VIII Of the Statues and other Publick Ornaments  IX Of the Gates of  London  and  Westminster    X Of the Publick and Private Prisons  XI Of the Markets of  London  c  XII Of the Publick Schools and Libraries  XIII Of the Shipping in the  Thames  and the Trade carry'd on by means of that noble River  XIV Of the Manner by which the City is supply'd with Water  XV Of the Christenings and Burials in  London  The Importance of the City of  London  to the whole Kingdom Of its comparative Proportion to the Publick Expence and the disproportionate Number of Members it returns  XVI The Benefit to the Publick of a good Understanding between the Court and City  To begin then with the first  viz  I  I  A brief Account of what the City was before the Fire and how improved when rebuilt and within a few Years after it  TAKE the City and its adjacent Buildings to stand as described by Mr  Stow  or by any other Author who wrote before the Fire of  London  and the Difference between what it was then and what it is now may be observed thus  Before the Fire of  London Anno  the Buildings look'd as if they had been formed to make one general Bonfire whenever any wicked Incendiaries should think fit to attempt it for the Streets were not only narrow and the Houses all built with Timber Lath and Plaster but the Manner of the Building in those Days one Story projecting out beyond another was such that in some narrow Streets the Houses almost touch'd one another at the Top insomuch that it often happened that if a House was on Fire the opposite House was in more Danger according as the Wind stood than the Houses adjoining on either Side  And tho' by the new Buildings after the Fire much Ground was given up to inlarge the Streets yet it is to be observed that the old Houses stood generally upon more Ground were much larger upon the Flat  and in many Places Gardens and large Yards about them so that there are many more Houses built than stood before on the same Ground For Example  Swithen  's  Alleys  by the  Royal Exchange  were all before the Fire taken up with one single Merchant's House Mr  Swithen  by Name whereas upon the same Ground where the House stood stand now about or Houses which belong to his Posterity  Copthall Court  in  Throgmortonstreet  was also before the Fire a single House inhabited by a  Dutch  Merchant likewise Three more Courts in the same Streets were single Houses Two on the same Side of the Way and one on the other  The several Alleys behind  St Christopher  's Church now vulgarly called  St Christopher's Churchyard  were likewise before the Fire one great House with Warehouses in which Mr  Kendrick  lived whom I have mentioned in my Account of  Reading  and  Newbury  and took up almost all the Ground on which now a Street of Houses is erected called  Prince'sstreet  going thro' into  Lothbury    King'sArms Yard  in  Colemanstreet  now built into fine large Houses and inhabited by eminent Merchants was before the Fire a Stableyard for Horses and an Inn which gave the Sign of the  King's Arms    I might give many more Instances but these will account for what some assert  viz  That so many great Houses were converted into Streets Courts Alleys and Buildings that near Houses stand on the Ground which the Fire left desolate more than stood on the same Ground before  Another Increase of Buildings in the City is to be taken from the Inhabitants in the unburnt Parts following the same Example of pulling down great old Buildings which took up large Tracks of Ground in some of the well inhabited Places and building  on the same Ground not only several Houses but even whole Streets of Houses which are since fully inhabited For Example  Crosbysquare  within  Bishopsgate  formerly the House of Sir  James Langham  Merchant  DevonshireSquare  and  Street  with several back Streets and Passages into  Petticoatlane  one Way and  Houndsditch  another all built on the Ground where the old Earl of  Devonshire  had an House and Garden  Bridgwatersquare  and several Streets adjoining built on the Ground where the Earl of  Bridgwater  had a large House and Garden in  Barbican    Billetersquare  and several Passages adjoining built upon the Grounds of one great House in which one Merchant only lived  All those Palaces of the Nobility formerly makeing a most beautiful Range of Buildings fronting the  Strand  with their Gardens reaching to the  Thames  where they had their particular Watergates and Stairs have had the same Fate such as  Essex Arundel Norfolk Salisbury Worcester Exeter Hungerford  and  York  Houses the Lord  Brook  's House in  Holbourn  in the Place of which are now so many noble Streets and Houses erected as are in themselves equal to a large City all which extend from the  Temple  to  Northumberlandhouse Somersethouse  and the  Savoy  only intervening and the latter of these may be said to be not an House but a little Town being separated into innumerable Tenements and Apartments  These are prodigious Inlargements to the City even upon that which I call inhabited Ground and where infinite Numbers of People now live more than lived upon the same Spot of Ground before  Suoh was the State of  London  before the Fire in and so prodigious were the Improvements made in it within the Course of a few Years after that Disaster But what are these compared to what has been done since within our own Memory And this brings me to my second Article  II Of the prodigious Increase of Buildings within our own Memory down to the Year  NOT to enter on a particular Description of the Buildings I shall only take notice of the Places where such Inlargements are made As  All those numberless Ranges of Building called  Spitalfields  reaching from  Spitalyard  at  Northern Fallgate  and from  Artillerylane  in  Bishopsgatestreet  with all the new Streets beginning at  Hoxton  and the Back of  Shoreditch  Church North and reaching to  Bricklane  and to the End of  Harestreet  on the Way to  Bethnalgreen  East then sloping away quite to  Whitechapel  Road Southeast containing as some People say above Acres of Ground which are now close built and inhabited with an infinite Number of People  The Lanes were deep dirty and unfrequented that Part now called  Spitalfieldsmarket  was a Field of Grass with Cows feeding on it since the Year The  Old Artilleryground  where the Parliament listed their first Soldiers against the King took up all those long Streets leading out of  Artillerylane  to  Spitalyard Back gate  and so on to the End of  Wheelerstreet Bricklane  which is now a long wellpaved Street was a deep dirty Road frequented chiefly by Carts fetching Bricks that way into  Whitechapel  from Brickkilns in those Fields whence it had its Name  On the more Eastern Part the same Increase goes on in Proportion namely all  Goodman'sfields  and the many Streets between  Whitechapel  and  Rosemarylane  all built since the Year  Wellclose  now called  Marine square  all the hither or West End of  Ratcliffhighway  from the Corner of  Gravellane  to the East End of  East Smithfield  was a Road over the Fields likewise those Buildings now called  Virginiastreet  and all the Streets on the Side of  Ratcliffhighway  to  Gravellane  abovenamed which of late Years extends so far that the End of  Limehouse  stands a Chance to be soon joined to the Beginning of  Poplar    To come to the North Side of the Town and beginning at  Shoreditch  West and  Hoxton square  and  Charlessquare  adjoining those were all open Fields from  Agnes St Clare  to  Hoxton  Town till the Year or thereabout  Pitfieldstreet  was a Bank parting two Pasturegrounds and  Ask  's Hospital was another open Field Farther West the like Addition of Buildings begins at the Footway by the  Pesthouse  and includes the  French  Hospital  Oldstreet  Two Squares and several Streets extending from  Bricklane  to  Mountmill  and the Road to  Islington  and from that Road still West to  Wood'sclose  and to  St John's  and  Clerkenwell  all which Streets and Squares are built since the Years and and were before that and some for a long Time after open Fields or Gardens and never built on till after that Time and moreover within these few Years all those open Grounds called  Bunhillfields  adjoining to the  Dissenters  Buryingground are now built upon and are complete Streets of Houses to the very Road and generally well inhabited  From hence we go on still West and beginning at  Gray'sInn  and going on to those formerly called  Redlion  Fields and  Lamb'sconduit  Fields we see there prodigious Piles of Buildings they begin at  Gray'sInnWall  towards  Redlionstreet  from whence in a strait Line they go quite to  Lamb'sconduit  Fields North including a great Range of Buildings reaching to  Bedfordrow  and the  Cockpit  East and including  Redlionsquare Ormondstreet Great  and  Little Marlboroughstreets Queen'ssquare  and all the Streets between the Square and  King'sgate  in  Holbourn  These Piles are very great and the  Houses so magnificent and large that abundance of Persons of Quality are found among them  Farther West in the same Line is  Southampton  great Square called  Bloomsbury  with  Kingstreet  on the East Side of it and all the numberless Streets West of the Square to the Marketplace and thro' Great  Russelstreet  by  Montaguhouse  quite into the  Hampstead  Road all which Buildings except  Southamptonhouse  and some of the Square have been formed from the open Fields since the Time abovementioned and contain several Thousands of Houses  The Increase of the Buildings in  St Gyles's  and  St Martin's in the Fields  is really a kind of Prodigy comprising all the Buildings North of  Longacre  up to the  Seven Dials  all the Streets from  Leicesterfields  and  St Martin'slane  both North and West to the  Haymarket  and  Scho  and from the  Haymarket  to  St James'sstreet  inclusive and to the Parkwall then all the Buildings on the North Side of the Street called  Picadilly  and the Road to  Knightsbridge  and between that and the South Side of  Tyburn  Road including  Sohosquare Goldensquare Hanoversquare  Two  Bondstreets George'sstreet  and that new  out to  Tyburn  Road called  Grosv  square  and  Cavendishsquare  and all the  them Some Part of which will be briefly mentioned under the Head of  Squares    This last Addition is by Calculation more in Bulk than the Cities of  Bristol Exeter  and  York  if they were all put together all which Places were a few Years ago mere Fields of Grass and imployed only to feed Cattle  In  Springgardens  near  Charingcross  are lately erected several very handsome new Buildings and a neat Chapel  The new Buildings in the End of  Broadstreet  near  Bishopsgate  formerly called  PettyFrance  deserve  to be mentioned here It is in every one's Memory what a poor and decay'd Place  PettyFrance  was but now the Spot where it stood is called  New Broadstreet  and consists of regular and stately Houses built after the Manner of those by  Hanoversquare  and are the most elegant Buildings in the City They are increased quite into  Old Bethlehem  which consisted of mean and ruinous Houses and there may be said to be a new and stately Town of Buildings erected here  And it would be endless to enumerate the other new Buildings that have taken Place in and about this great City of old and ruinous Houses and Streets  See the Articles of  Churches Squares  c  III Of the Publick Offices and City Corporations  THE EXCISEOFFICE is kept in the  Old Jewry  in a very large House formerly the Dwelling of Sir  John Frederick  and afterwards of Sir  John Hern  very considerable Merchants In this one Office is managed an immense Weight of Business and they have in Pay several Thousands of Officers The whole Kingdom is divided by them into proper Districts and to every District a Collector a Supervisor and a certain Number of Gaugers called by the Vulgar  Excisemen    Under the Management of this Office are now brought not only the Excise upon Beer Ale and other Liquors as formerly but also the Duties on Malt and Candles Hops Soap and Leather Coffee Tea and Chocolate all which we managed in several Classes  The Act lately passed against retailing spirituous Liquors in less Quantities than Two Gallons which had become so pernicious a Trade that the lower Class of People was almost wholly debauched and  enervated by it has very much increased the Consequence as well as the Business of this Office for the Commissioners for what relates to this Matter are a kind of absolute Judges in the Cases brought before them  The POSTOFFICE is kept in  Lombardstreet  in a large House formerly Sir  Robert Viner  's and is under an admirable Management The  Penypost  is a Branch of it and a most useful Addition to Trade and Business for by it Letters are delivered at the remotest Corners of the Town almost as soon as they could be fent by a Messenger and that from Four Five Six to Eight times a Day according as the Distance of the Place makes it practicable insomuch that you may send a Letter from  Limehouse  in the East to the farthest Part of  Westminster  for a Peny several times in the same Day and to the neighbouring Villages as  Kensington Hamersmith Chiswick  c Westward  Newington Islington Kentishtown Hampstead Holloway Highgate  c Northward to  Newingtonbutts Camberwell  c Southward and  Stepney Poplar Bow Stratford Deptford Greenwich  c Eastward once a Day  Nor are you tied up to a single Piece of Paper as in the  General Postoffice  but any Packet under a Poundweight goes at the same Price  The CUSTOMHOUSE comes next to be mentioned The  Long Room  is like an  Exchange  every Morning and the Croud of People who appear there and the Business they do is not to be explained by Words The whole Building is very convenient but not like what it might or ought to have been and moreover the Quays thereabouts are so throng'd and crouded that they are much too little for the Business continually carrying on there  Between the Horseguards at  Whitehall  and  Charingcross  at an huge Expence but with very little Taste is seen the newerected ADMIRALTYOFFICE This Office is perhaps of the most Importance of  any of the publick Parts of the Administration the Royal Navy being the Sinews of our Strength  The NAVYOFFICE a neat and convenient Building in  Cruchedfryars  and the VICTUALLINGOFFICE on  Towerhill  near  East Smithfield  both which had we room deserve a particular Description are but Branches of this Administration and receive their Orders from hence as do likewise the Docks and Yards theirs from the  Navyoffice  the Whole being carried on with the most exquisite Order and Dispatch The  Admiralty  has been in Commission ever since the Death of Prince  George  of  Denmark  The Commissioners so often change by Deaths or Removals that it will be of very little Use to insert them in a Work like this  Tho' his MAJESTY resides all the Winter at  St James  's yet the Business of the Government is chiefly carried on at the  Cockpit Whitehall  Near which is lately finished a magnificent Building with a very grand Front looking to the Parade in  St James  's  park  for the TREASURYOFFICE and it being a lofty Structure over that is the OFFICE of the SECRETARIES OF STATE  The OFFICE for the BOARD OF TRADE is held just by the Upperend of the  Privygarden  adjoining to an old Gate at the Entrance of  Kingstreet  which is now demolish'd It is a large House and convenient for the Purpose  At the Horseguards is a Building commodious enough built as a Barrack for a large Detachment of the Horseguards who keep Post here over it are Offices belonging to the Judgeadvocate for holding Councils of War for Trial of Deserters and others according to the Articles of War  A new Office and House is very lately erected adjoining to the Horseguards for the Paymastergeneral of the Army  The BANK used to be kept in  Grocershall  but is within these few Years removed to an intire new Edifice built for that thriving Corporation in  Threadneedlestreet  adjoining to  St Christopher  's Church It is a noble Structure but I have not room for a particular Description of it  The EAST INDIA HOUSE situated where formerly was that of Sir  William Craven  was rebuilt in the Year It is very convenient within but without makes not the Appearance that is worthy of the Company's Trade and Figure in the World its Front being not extended enough In the back Part towards  Limestreet  they have also Warehouses which were rebuilt in a very handsome manner  Anno    The AFRICAN COMPANY'S HOUSE is in the same Street a convenient House which serves for all the Offices their Business requires  The SOUTHSEA HOUSE is situate in a large Spot of Ground between  Broadstreet  and  Threadneedlestreet  At first two large Houses were taken in to form the whole Office but as they were streighten'd for Room and were obliged to summon their General Courts at  Merchant Taylorshall  hard by so they have lately erected a new Building for the whole Business which my Limits will not permit me particularly to describe  The YORKBUILDINGS COMPANY has been struggling for some Years past with the great Difficulties into which it has been plunged by the Fatality attending some late Transactions and I shall say no more of it here  Here are also several great Offices for Societies of INSURERS where almost all Hazards may be insured The Four principal are called  The Royal Exchange Insurance  kept in a Part of the  Royal Exchange    The Royal Insurance  kept in  Cornhill    The  Handinhand Fireoffice  kept on  Snowhill    The Sun Fireoffice  in  Threadneedlestreet    In the Two first all Hazards by Sea of Ships and Goods not Lives are insured as also Houses and Goods are insured from Fire  In the last Two only Houses and Goods  In all which Offices the  Premio  is so small and the Recovery in case of Loss so easy and certain that nothing can be shewn like it in the World  There are also Offices of INSURANCE ON LIVES the  Union Fireoffice  in  Gutterlane  the  Westminster Fireoffice  and others which manage a great deal of Business in the same way  The CHARITABLE CORPORATION OFFICE is in  Springgarden  A Society that set out with laudable Pretensions but many Hundreds of People have found to their Cost that the best Pretences are often made a Cloak for the worst Practices  Fair and Softly  is now the Word with them and 'tis fit a profound Stilness should succeed the boisterous Storm they occasioned in which the Fortunes of Multitudes of innocent Subjects suffered a Wreck which they will never recover  The Offices of ORDNANCE and the MINT for Coining Money are kept in the Tower of  London    IV Of the  Mansionhouse  and other most noted Edifices Squares and Publick Structures in and about  London    THAT beautiful Column called the  Monument  erected at the Charge of the City to perpetuate the fatal Burning of the Whole cannot be mentioned but with some due Respect to the Building itself as well as to the City It is Feet high and exceeds all the Obelisks and Pillars of the Antients There is a Staircase in the Middle  to ascend to the Balcony which is about Feet short of the Top and whence there are other Steps made even to look out at the Top of all which is fashioned like an Urn with a Flame issuing from it  The Lord Mayors of this famous Metropolis have been hitherto forced to content themselves with residing in some one or other of the stately Halls of the City Companies hired for that Purpose an Inconvenience which was equally unworthy of the Grandeur of the great Officer and of the City over which he presided and which now will be soon remedied for on the th Day of  October  the chief Cornerstone of the Mansionhouse was laid by the Right Honourable  Micajah Perry    Esq  then Lord Mayor and by the Committee appointed for that Purpose in the Place where  Stocksmarket  used to be kept with an Inscription on it signifying as much and giving the Names of the Gentlemen of the said Committee the Sheriffs and the Architect but perhaps it may be as much to the latter Gentleman's Credit not to name him as to name him for Connoisseurs find so many Faults with the Design that if what they say is true tho' it may be a costly Building yet will it not do any great Honour to this famous Metropolis among good Judges  The  Royal Exchange  is the greatest Burse in the World It is so well known and has been so often described that it is unnecessary for me to enter upon it here 'Tis said that it cost above  l  in building and yet the Interest of the Money was a great while answered by the Rent made of the Shops and Vaults but now the Trade that used to be carried on there is so dispersed in other Places that it cannot be supposed to do so According to Architectural Criticism the Building has numerous Faults the Turret is egregiously bad tho' a very expensive Part of the Structure  The Hospital of  Bethlehem  is a noble Pile but we shall take notice of it under the Head of HOSPITALS  The  SouthSea House  the  Bank  the  EastIndia House  c also the  Treasury  the  Admiralty  the  Customhouse  the  Excise  and other Publick Offices are taken notice of under the preceding Article of PUBLICK OFFICES  c  The  College of Physicians  in  Warwicklane  is a beautiful and magnificent Structure built of Brick and Stone and is one of the finest Ornaments of the City tho' built in a Place where all its Beauties are in a manner buried We have not room to be so particular in its Description as it very well deserves but we shall take notice that in the Front of the Hall towards the Court is a Statue of King  Charles  II well cut in Stone  On the Westside of the Theatre is another of Sir  John Cutler  and in  June  a very fine Busto carved out of a Block of White Marble was erected in the great Hall of this College to the Honour of the famous Dr  Harvey  with the following Inscription on its Marble Pediment  Hanc magni illius  GULIELMI HARVEIJ  Senis Octogenar  Imaginem  Qui Sanguinis Circuitum  Primus monstravit  Medicinamque rationalem instituit  Ad Picturam Archetypam  Quam in suo servat M  se  effi  tam  Hororis Causá  Hic p  nendam curavit  RICHARDUSMEAD Med Reg  A D  MDCCXXXIX  In  English  thus  Richard Mead  Physician to his Majesty caused this Statue of the Great  William Harvey  who first demonstrated the Circulation of the Blood and instituted a rational Course of Medicine to be here erected in the Year in Token of his Veneration according to the original Picture drawn at Years of Age which he keeps in his own Library  The  Surgeons  Theatre in  Monkwellstreet  is a fine Piece of Architecture admirably disposed for Seeing and Hearing the Work of the famous  Inigo Jones  The noble Earl of  Burlington  out of Love to the  Memory of this Architect was pleased to repair it at his own Charge  In the Hall of this Theatre is a capital Picture of  Hans Holbein  in which is the Portrait of King  Henry  VIII sitting in his Chair delivering the Charter which he granted to the College of Physicians  c  It is said the Company have been offered  l  for this Piece for it is highly valuable as it is the only remaining Picture of the first Painter of Note in this Kingdom his celebrated Piece called  The Dance of Death  being destroy'd by Fire and not only presents the King taken from the Life but also the most eminent Physicians of that Time when the Incorporation was granted and excepting the famous Familypiece by  Titian  in the Possession of the Duke of  Somerset  and another of the  Pembroke  Family at  Wilton  painted by  Vandyke  it is esteemed the most valuable  Portraitpicture  in the Kingdom  Thanethouse  in  Aldersgatestreet  built by  Inigo Jones  is intirely worthy of him but it is now let out to a Tavern and other Trades as unworthy of its Founder as of its Architect  The Palace of the Bishop of  London  is overagainst it It is an old Building and no otherwise remarkable than that it is let out to Tradesmen chiefly and has not been for a great while the Residence of its Bishop who has a Country Palace at  Fulham  and the Air of the  Court  being judged better than that of the  City Whitehall  has been preferred to it for a Townresidence  Several Acts of Parliament have passed within these few Years for building a new Bridge over the  Thames  at  Westminster  and Three successive Lotteries have been given for that End It was at first resolved to be built at the  Horseferry  over to  Lambeth  but those who had most Influence changing their Minds the Design was altered and it is now  begun at the  Woolstaple  near  Palaceyard  and is to be carry'd to  Stangate  on the opposite Side Great Powers are given by this Act to Commissioners to agree with Persons who own Houses and Lands on either Shore and they intend to pull down whole Streets about  Palaceyard  and  Channingrow  besides what they are to do on the  Surry  Side for the more commodious Passage to it In short if the Plan be pursued that is proposed it will be a very considerable Work but yet we must say that the greatest Part of the Expence would have been saved had it been built where first proposed and as the Money is raised by Lotteries which are always of pernicious Consequence to Trade it had been perhaps as well in the present Juncture of the publick Affairs that the nearest way had been followed and I may presume to intimate that tho' the Horseferry were to be rejected yet  Scotlandyard  which is a great Body of ruinous or decaying Buildings and joins to  Whitehall  and to which the main Streets point leading down from  Pallmall Picadilly  c by  Charingcross  would have been in my humble Opinion a preferable Situation 'Tis certain it might have been effected there not only with more Conveniency but at an easy Expence to what now must be the Case and there had been no need to have pulled down the Houses of Tradesmen and others which brought in tolerable Rents by their Vicinity to  Westminsterhall  and the Two Houses of Parliament Several Stone Piers are already erected in the  Thames  and they are proceeding with one of the noblest Streets of Houses that are any where to be seen fronting  Palaceyard  And here we shall leave it for this time chusing rather to describe  what is  than what is  designed to be  since the Time this Work will take up still may subject it to several Alterations now not easy to be foreseen  The newbuilt Houses of the Dukes of  Montagu  and  Richmond  in the  PrivyGarden  are convenient and noble Structures  The  Meuse  near  CharingCross  where the King's Horses are kept and the Coaches of State set up is a very large kind of Square but the Buildings being old and unworthy of the Situation as well as of the Use are as 'tis said to be pulled down and built in a beautiful manner The principal Range at the upper End is already finish'd and when the other Parts are completed it will be one of the finest Things of its kind in  Europe    On the right Side of the Street coming from  Whitehall  is  Northumberlandhouse  belonging to the Duke of  Somerset  in Right of Marriage  It is an antient but large and welldesign'd Building and fit to receive a Retinue of One hundred in Family nor does the Duke's Family come so far short of the Number as not very handsomely to fill the House  Carlton  House and Gardens adjoining to St  James  's Park belong to his Royal Highness the Prince of  Wales  who has built an Octagon at the Westend of his Garden which is elegantly furnished The lower Part is a Grotto or fine Batheingroom over which is a Diningroom finely adorn'd with Pictures  c  and with Four Marble Busto's of  Shakespear Milton Dryden  and Mr  Pope  On the Outside over the Door one on each Side are placed the Busto's of the renown'd King  Alfred  and  Edward the Black Prince  both so famous in  English  History with Inscriptions to their Honour which at the same time are equally so to that of the Royal Erector of them who gives a glorious Specimen therein of what Examples he thinks most worthy of his heroick Imitation  The noble Houses of the late Dukes of  Marlborough  and  Buckinghamshire  in St  James  's Park are  too well known to need any particular Description  The newbuilt House of the Duke of  Devonshire  in  Picadilly  that noble one built by the famous  Inigo Jones  being destroy'd by Fire in the newly beautified one of the Duke of  Bedford  in  BloomsburySquare  those of the Lord  Bateman  the Duke of  Queensbury  General  Wade  and the late Lord  Bingley  the noble and extensive Streets of Buildings about  Soho Grosvenor Cavendish  and  Hanoversquares  with those noble Squares themselves and the new Alterations in St  James  's  square Redlionsquare Lincoln'sInnFields  the new Buildings about  JockeyFields Chancerylane Fetterlane SerjeantsInn Cravenstreet  and the  NewExchange  in the  Strand  now all built into fine Houses would take up too much of my Room to particularize and I can therefore only name them having so many curious Matters to add in these Letters  But yet I cannot forbear particularly to mention one Beauty because it is an Honour to our Country and that is the great Piazza in  CoventGarden  the noblest Square in  Europe  for Grandeur of the Design especially with the Beauty of the East Front of that elegant Church the only Piece the Moderns have yet produced that can admit of a just Comparison with the Works of Antiquity where a majestick Simplicity commands the Approbation of the Judicious The rustick Arcade round the Square is of an excellent Composition above which is a grand Story and an Attick and the Windows dress'd with a regular Entablature  I must but slightly mention for the Reasons already given the new Road in  Hydepark  the Reservoirs in the Two Parks the late Queen's Library  c  which may just serve as a Hint to Travellers who have less upon their Hands than I have upon mine  V Of the principal Hospitals and other Charitable Institutions in and about the City of  London    NO City in the World can shew the like Number of private and publick Charities as the Cities of  London  and  Westminster    I have not Room particularly to describe them and must therefore content myself with giving little more than their Names and those of their munificent Founders referring to those larger Works where more ample Accounts and Descriptions may be expected  then I will mention  Bethlehem  Hospital in  Moorfields  erected at the Charge of the City  Anno  and said to be built after the Model of  Versailles  This has lately received very great Additions and is design'd for the Reception of Lunaticks    Bridewell  is as well an House of Correction as an Hospital It was formerly the King's City Palace but given to the City by King  Edward  VI for the reclaiming of idle Persons Vagrants  c  and for bringing up Lads to Handicraft Businesses  There are Two other Houses of Correction call'd  Bridewells  one at  Clerkenwell  for  Middlesex  the other in  To  hillfields  for  Westminster      Christ'sHospital  originally founded by King  Edward  VI at the Request of the LordMayor and Aldermen of  London  and of the pious Martyr Dr  Ridley  then Bishop of  London  for entertaining educating nourishing and bringing up the poor Children of the Citizens such as their Parents or Fathers at least being dead have no other way of Support  This noble Charity maintains near poor Children who have Food Cloathing and Instruction useful and sufficient Learning and an exceeding good Discipline observ'd and at the proper Ages they are put out to Trades suitable to their several Genius's and Capacities and others are taught Mathematicks Navigation and Arithmetick to fit them for private and publick Service The seeing of these Children at Church on a  Sunday  at  ChristChurch  and at Supper on  Sunday  Evening may be reckon'd as fine a Sight as any in  London  and occasions a constant Resort of People of all Ranks who admire the Neatness of their Appearance and the good Management of the House Dependent on this noble Charity is also an House at  Hertford  where Diet Schooling  c  are given to the younger Boys    St Bartholomew  's Hospital adjoins to  Christ  's Hospital Its first Foundation may be said to be owing to King  Henry  VIII whose Statue in Stone very well done is for that Reason erected in the new Front over the Entrance to the  Cloyster  in  WestSmithfield  with Two Cripples no mean Pieces of Sculpture on the Top of the Pediment over his Head This Hospital has received very great Additions of late Years and they are going on building still and 'tis well if they do not overdo it for they demolish their Houses and reduce their Estates by it and leave it upon the Generosity of future Benefactors to support what they are about  This Hospital relieves about Patients daily with Lodging Diet Physick and Chirurgery  The  Locke  at  Kingsland  and that in  Southwark  belong to  St Bartholomew  's Hospital and are used for such as have the foul Disease only  There generally is under the Care of this Hospital upwards of poor sick and lame Persons destitute of other Relief    St Thomas's Hospital  in  Southwark  is also a noble Piece of Charity of the like Nature with that of  St Bartholomew  The Church and most of the Hospital was rebuilt in a beautiful manner from the Year to It was founded by  Edw  VI and Inscriptions are set up in it to the Honour of Mr  Guy  Mr  Frederick  Sir  Robert Clayton  the last of whom has his Statue there as has King  Edw  VI lately erected by  Charles Joy    Esq  late Treasurer of this Hospital    Guy  's  Hospital  is situated very near  St Thomas  's  Hospital  and is perhaps one of the greatest private Charities that was ever known Its Founder  Thomas Guy  was a Bookseller in  Lombardstreet  He lived to see this Work in great Forwardness and at his Death  Anno  left about  l  to finish and endow it  Anno  Mr  Guy  's Statue was erected in the principal Square  Tho' this Hospital is said to be for Incurables it is not for such as are absolutely so for the Founder used to say That he would not have his Hospital made an Almshouse  Over and above the  l  left to this Hospital the Founder left as many Legacies and other Dispositions as were computed to amount to near  l  more  The  London Workhouse  as it is called founded on an Act of Parliament passed in the th Year of King  Charles  II is situated without  Bishopsgate  and is an Edifice consisting of several Workrooms and Lodgingrooms for Vagrants and ParishChildren  They have a handsome Chapel built at the upper End of the Yard belonging to the House where they go to Prayers twice a Day at Seven in the Morning and at Seven in the Evening On  Sundays  they all go to  St Helen  's where they have Seats  The Charityschools and Workhouses set up in almost every Parish of this prodigious City have in  some measure pursued the Design of this laudable Workhouse and if they have thereby interfered with it and taken off some Benefactions that otherwise might have flowed into that Canal it will be the less to be wondered at  The Hospital called the  CharterHouse  or  Sutton  's Hospital must be recorded to be the greatest and noblest Gift that ever was given for Charity by any one Man publick or private in this Nation since History gives us any Account of Things except we give a Preference to that of Mr  Guy  The Revenue of Mr  Sutton  's Hospital being besides the Purchase of the Place and the Building of the House and other Expences little less than  l per Annum  Revenue it is of so long standing and its Government  c  so well known that we shall afford it no further Mention  The Royal Hospitals of  Greenwich  and  Chelsea  are also not mentioned in this Account as not being within the Reach of the extended Bounds of the City of  London  as we have laid them down and are therefore taken Notice of in their proper Places  The  Greycoat  and  Greencoat  Hospital in  Tothillfields Emanuel  Hospital  Westminster  that for the Poor of the  French  Refugees near  Islington  the  Ironmongers  Almshouses near  Shoreditch  Alderman  Aske  's at  Hoxton  those stately ones of the  Trinityhouse  the  Vintners  and several others in the Way to  MileEnd  as also those handsome ones lately erected by the Will of Mr  Francis Bancroft  a LordMayor's Officer in the same Road all deserve particular Mention had I room for it  But I must say a Word or two of those useful Charities the Two Infirmaries one in  James  's  street Westminster  and the other at  Hydepark Corner  which have given Birth to the like laudable Institutions in other Parts of the Kingdom The Design of them is to supply the Places of the Hospitals of  St Bartholomew  and  St Thomas  's aforemention'd there being no such charitable Foundations in the City of  Westminster  And here the best Order is observ'd the best Medicines dispensed and the best Assistances given as well by Physicians as Surgeons and Apothecaries to all who are admitted into these Charities I shall refer you to the Accounts publish'd by each every Year for further Particulars of their Institutions Progress and Success  In  August  a Corporation was erected for the Relief of poor Officers Widows belonging to the Navy which allots  l per Ann  to a Captain's Widow  l  to a Lieutenant's and  l  to the Widows of Boatswains Gunners Carpenters Pursers Surgeons Second Master of a Yacht or Master of a Naval Vessel warranted by the Navyboard provided the annual Incomes of their Real and Personal Estates do not amount to the aforesaid yearly Sums To this Charity all Admirals Captains Lieutenants and Warrant Officers pay  d per  Pound out of their Salaries and his Majesty King  George  II graciously contributed  l  as a Foundation for it  In the Year a most useful and longwish'dfor Charity was establish'd by Royal Charter in order to found an Hospital for the Maintenance and Education of exposed and deserted young Children otherwise called Foundlings  An Act of Parliament has passed for confirming and inlarging the Powers granted by this Charter and to enable them to execute the good Purposes thereof and several Meetings of the Governors and Guardians have been held and Sixty Children have been determined to be admitted for a Beginning and as many Gentlemen have already subscribed it is to be hoped that Succes  will attend this praiseworthy and longwish'dfor Undertaking The Governors have hired the House in  HattonGarden    wherein the late Sir  Fisher Tench  lived till they shall be able to build a proper Hospital which they intend to do on the North Side of  Ormondstreet  and  Lamb  's Conduit having purchased of the Earl of  Salisbury  Four Fields of Pasture Land containing Fiftysix Acres at the Rate of  l  for the Purpose  The Corporation for Clergymens Sons deserves also to be taken Notice of as an excellent Institution but we must draw to a Conclusion of this Article  We shall only further observe in general That those noble Foundations added to the innumerable Almshouses which are to be seen in almost every Part of  London  make it certain that there is no City in the World can shew the like Number of Charities from private Hands there being not less than Twenty thousand People maintain'd of Charity besides the Charities of Schooling for Children and besides the Collections at the annual Feasts of several Kinds where Money is given for putting out Children Apprentices  c  a great Number of which owe their Rise to the Period of Time included in Years past so that the  Papists  have no Reason to boast that there were greater Benefactions and Acts of Charity to the Poor given in their Days than in our Protestant Times And this is indeed one of the principal Reasons for my making mention of it in this Place for let any particular Age be singled out and let the Charities of this Age for about Years past and the Sums of Money bestowed by Protestants in this Nation on mere Acts of Charity to the Poor not reckoning Gifts to the Church be cast up it will appear they are greater by far than can be found in  England  in any the like Number of Years take the Time when we will  Nor do I include in this the Money collected by Briefs all over  England  upon Casualties by Fire though that is an eminent Act of Charity as any can be nor the Money given either in publick or private for Rebuilding  St Paul  's and other Churches demolished by the Fire of  London  or the Augmentation of poor Benefices by the Bounty of Queen  Anne  and many other such Gifts  VI Of the Churches of  London Westminster  and  Southwark    THERE are within the Walls of  London  Parishes without the Walls in the OutParishes in  Middlesex  and  Surrey  in the Bills of Mortality and in the City and Liberty of  Westminster  in all We shall as briefly as possible touch upon the most remarkable Churches  We must observe in the first Place That the Churches in  London  are rather convenient than fine not adorn'd with Pomp and Pageantry as in  Popish  Countries but like the true Protestant Plainness have very little Ornament either within or without  But the most famous of all the Churches in the City and of all the Protestant Churches in the World is the Cathedral of  St Paul  an Edifice exceedingly beautiful and magnificent with fewer Faults than are to be found in any Building of the like Nature and Extent tho' some who would be thought to have Skill in Architecture are pleased to say there are many and particularly censure it for its Heaviness tho' perhaps it would be found that the Fault is in their not considering separately the Beauty and Proportion of every Part in order to enter into the Nature and Design of the whole Composition  The vast Extent of the horizontal Arch of the Cupola which supports a Stone Lantern near Feet high may well account for the Strength of the Piers and Butments below Eight of which support the Whole of that prodigious Weight And tho' common Observers assert that those Piers as also the Piers of all the Arches withinside are too thick and heavy yet whoever knows any thing of the Rules of Architecture must allow them to be as slender as the Strictness of those Rules would admit of for the Thickness of each Pier is not one Third Part of the Void of each Arch And as to the Piers which support the Dome they when compar'd with those that support the Cupola of St  Peter  's at  Rome  come out to be but one Third Part of the Bigness of the latter the one measuring Feet in Circumference the other not quite yet there is not a great deal of Difference in the Dimensions and Weight of the Two Cupola's For that of  St Paul  's is considerably larger and higher in Proportion to the Piers that support it and to the Body of the Church than that of  St Peter  's Wherefore I may venture upon the whole to assert that were we to compare every Part of the Two Buildings together we shall find  St Paul  's to be much less liable to the Objection of being a heavy Pile than  St Peter  's  The chief Reason as I imagine why this Church is censur'd for Heaviness is not that it is really so in itself but appears so compar'd with the  Gothick  Architecture which is more familiar to some Persons than the other and admits of an extravagant Airiness and Lightness In that  of Building the Designer is bound down to no Rules of Proportion but what his own F  ncy sug  sts  whereas in the other the Dimens  ns of every individual Member are ascertained which cannot be deviated from without occasioning a Fault The Height of every  Arch hath a fix'd Proportion to its Breadth the Doors Windows and their Ornaments are the same the Intercolumniations and their Intablatures are all confin'd to certain Admeasurement But who ever found that Exactness observ'd in any  Gothick  Structure It must be allowed there are Pieces of that Sort of Architecture that in the Whole look very august and venerable Yet let any one view the vast Stone Buttresses round the Outside of  Westminster  Abbey and see what Confusion of Lines and Breaks they occasion in the Perspective and they will then easily account for the Lightness of the Inside of that Building for they are those Buttresses which by extending so far out support the whole Structure more than its Walls or Pillars This I mention for the sake of common Observers only for to the Judicious it is altogether unnecessary  Sir  Christopher Wren  had the Satisfaction to find the injudicious Reprovers of his Work confuted by the Approbation of the best Masters in  Europe  who allow'd That the Church of  St Peter  's at  Rome  which is the most stupendous Structure in the World only exceeds  St Paul  's with respect to the Largeness of its Dimensions its rich  Mosaick  Work the beautiful Marble of which both its Outside and Inside intirely consist the latter in different Colours its Statues Paintings Gildings Altars and Oratories Ornaments not allowed of in Protestant Churches  Had the Inside of  St Paul  's been adorned in as profuse and pompous a Manner as  St Peter  's it would have attracted the Admiration of superficial Criticks so that they would never have been able to discover the Faults they now pretend to find Faults which can only be attributed to the Plainness of its Materials But to such as are real Judges the Harmony Proportion and Beauty of Buildings are equally admirable whether they be executed in plain  Freestone or the most beautiful Marble whether the Carvings or Mouldings be gilt or not the Recesses or Panels in the Walls be curiously painted or only plaister'd  In the Year the House of Commons had it under Consideration whether the Cupola should be cover'd with  This is an authentick Account of the Matter  Copper or Lead and upon Inquiry into which was most expedient and least expensive it appear'd that the Covering of Lead would amount to about Tons and the Expence thereof including Workmanship was estimated at  l  The Copper Covering was computed at Eleven Tons Three hundred Three Quarters and odd Pounds and the Expence was estimated at  l  Upon which the House fixed upon a Copper Covering  But when the Bill which had a Clause in it for that Purpose went up to the Lords their Lordships left out the Clause upon which the Commons desired a Conference alleging that Copper was preferable to any other Covering as well in respect of Duration as Lightness for that Lead being subject to frequent Repairs the necessary Scaffolding for that Purpose at any one time would exceed the Difference of Charge between that and Copper besides that frequent Scaffolding would very much prejudice the Building But the Sessions closing the same Day put an End to the Affair and there were no Conferences tho' the preceding Reasons were what the Commons intended to offer if there had been one  It very probably was upon this Occasion that Sir  Christopher  is said to have declared his Opinion in the House of Commons when some Gentlemen doubted whether the Cupola would bear the Leaden Covering that it was able to bear Tons more than what is now upon it and that he would undertake  to raise a Spire of Stone upon the whole Feet higher than the Cross now stands  The Expence of this magnificent Structure as it was laid before the Parliament  Anno  including the Building of the Chapterhouse near it a neat and elegant Fabrick purchasing of Property together with the Estimate of what was necessary to complete the whole in which was concluded a Ring of Twelve Bells not yet put up nor cast as also the Furniture for the Choir amounted to  l    s  These Things that were not so easy for every one to know we have thought it necessary to inlarge upon Our Bounds will not permit us to say all that the Subject requires and we would not dwell upon Points which every one knows or may easily inform himself of by his own Observation or from other Writers in relation to this famous Structure  But one thing it will be requisite to observe further which every one does not know and which therefore I shall mention  This able Architect Sir  Christopher Wren  at the first setting about the Church would have had its Situation removed a little to the North to stand just on the Spot of Ground which is taken up by  Paternoster Row  and the Buildings on either Side so that the Northside of the Church should have stood open to  Newgatestreet  and the Southside to the Ground on which the Church now stands  By this Situation the Eastend of the Church would have looked directly down the main Street of the City  Cheapside  and for the Westend  Ludgate  having been removed a little North the main Street called  Ludgatestreet  and  Ludgatehill  would only have sloped a little W S W as they do now irregularly Two Ways one within and the other without the Gate and all the Street beyond  FleetBridge  would have received no Alteration at all  By this Situation the common Thoroughfare of the City would have been removed at a little farther Distance from the Work and we should not then have been obliged to walk just under the very Wall as we do now which makes the Work appear out of all Perspective and is the chief Reason of the Objections I have mention'd as to the outside Appearance whereas had it been viewed at a little Distance the Building would have been seen infinitely to more Advantage  Had Sir  Christopher  been allowed this Situation he would then also have had more room for the Ornament of the Westend which tho' a most beautiful Work would have been much more so then and he would have added a circular Piazza to it after the Model of that of  Rome  but much more magnificent and an Obelisk of Marble in the Centre of the Circle exceeding any thing that the World can shew of its Kind of modern Work  But the Circumstance of Things hindered this noble Design and the City being almost rebuilt before he obtain'd an Order and Provision for laying the Foundation he was prescribed to the narrow Spot where it now stands in which the Building however magnificent in itself stands with great Disadvantage as to the Prospect of it The Inconveniencies of this were so apparent when the Church was finish'd that Leave was at length tho' not without Difficulty obtain'd to pull down one whole Row of Houses on the Northside of the Body of the Church to make Way for the noble Balustrade of cast Iron raised upon an handsome Stone Wall of above a Yard high that surrounds the Churchyard and indeed to admit Light into the Church as well as to preserve it from the Danger of Fire  That admirable Architect met with no better Success in a Plan which was one of the most beautiful  that could enter the Mind of Man and would have made this City the noblest on Earth this I shall relate in the Words of a certain Author  viz  "The Fire of  London  furnish'd the most perfect Occasion that can ever happen in any City to rebuild it with Pomp and Regularity This Sir  Christopher Wren  foresaw and 'tis said offer'd a Scheme which would have made it the Wonder of the World He proposed to have laid out one large Street from  Aldgate  to  TempleBar  in the middle of which was to have been a large Square capable of containing the new Church of St  Paul  's with a proper Distance for the View all round whereby that huge Building would not have been cooped up as 'tis at present in such a manner as nowhere to be seen to Advantage at all but would have had a long and ample Vista at each End to have reconcil'd it to a proper Point of View and give it one great Benefit which in all Probability it must now want for ever He farther proposed to rebuild all the Parishchurches in such a Manner as to be seen at the End of every Vista of Houses and dispersed in such Distances from each other as to appear neither too thick nor thin in Prospect and give a proper Heightening to the whole Bulk of the City as it filled the Landschape Lastly he proposed to build all the Houses uniform and supported on a Piazza like that of  CoventGarden  and by the Waterside from the Bridge to the  Temple  he had planned a long and broad Wharf or Quay where he designed to have ranged all the Halls that belong to the several Companies of the City with proper Warehouses for Merchants between to vary the Edifices and make it at once one of the most beautiful and most useful Ranges of Structure in the World But the Hurry of Rebuilding and  the Disputes of Property prevented this glorious Scheme from taking Place"  When this great Man found he could not carry this Point he proposed what we have already mention'd but as we have observ'd with as little Success as the above grand Scheme private Property on this Occasion as it does on most others getting the better both of publick Utility and publick Spirit  The new Churches at  Limehouse Ratcliffehighway Spitalfields Oldstreet  the  Strand Ormondstreet Hanoversquare  the  Horseferry Bloomsbury  I can but just mention tho' they deserve to be taken notice of by Travellers But the latter I must observe was the first Building wherein was introduced a Portico after the Manner of the antient Temples The Body of the Church is a masterly Performance but the placing for a Weathercock the Statue of a Prince famous for good Sense and Steadiness is an Absurdity peculiar to the Church of  Bloomsbury    The newbuilt Steeples or Towers of  St Margaret  's  Westminster St Michael  's  Cornhill St Mary Aldermary St Sepulchre  's  St Christopher  's  St Dunstan  's in the East  St Clement  's  Danes  and the newbuilt Churches of  St Mary Woolnoth Bishopsgate St Leonard Shoreditch St Catharine Coleman St Martin  's in the Fields  St Giles  's I can only mention  Among the Beauties of  London  must be numbered the admirable Church of  St Stephen Walbrooke  the  TempleChurch BowChurch St Clement  's  Danes St Paul CoventGarden  and that incomparable Piece called  The Banquetinghouse  at  Whitehall  now made use of as a Chapel This was the Design of  Inigo Jones  as one Pavilion for that admirable Model he gave for a Palace And if this Specimen has justly commanded the Admiration of  Mankind what must the finish'd Piece have done It is to be hoped  Britain  will one Day have the Glory to accomplish it according to this Plan and then it will far exceed all the Palaces of the Universe Here is Strength with Politeness Ornament with Simplicity and Beauty with Majesty It is without Dispute one of the noblest Structures in the World The Ceiling is an admirable fine Piece of Painting by  Rubens    The Abbey or Collegiate Church of  Westminster  is a venerable old Pile of Building but begins to appears with a new Face for a Tower is actually finish'd at the Westend and another is about The Beginning of a fine and costly Spire was also laid some time ago near the Middle of the Edifice which however is yet uncertain whether it will be proceeded on or not The West Window fronting these Towers is one of the most beautiful in Glass Painting that has been done of late Years and the Window also fronting  Kingstreet  finish'd in the Deanry of the late Bishop  Atterbury  is one of the finest modern Performances of its kind  We are also assur'd that the Houses adjoining to this venerable Building will be all pull'd down and the Building left clear an Action that will be as laudable when done as it was scandalous when begun the Effect of private Avarice whereby that venerable Pile is subjected to the Hazards of Fire and other Accidents whenever an idle Servant shall get in a sottish a careless or sleepy Fit  But after all this Building tho' very expensive is far less elegant than several other  Gothick  Structures Its Outside can never be made beautiful and within it is extravagantly out of Proportion with regard to the Height and Breadth of the middle Nef and SideAyles The high Altar withinside is a noble Piece and had a wonderful fine Effect from the  West Door before the Organ lately erected intercepted its View  The Towers at the Westend which I have just mention'd as they stand so close together are not sufficiently contracted in the carrying them up The Four Pinacles have a very wretched Effect when viewed in a diagonal Line The Style of the Building so far as is intire new Work is a sort of Medley neither  Gothick  nor any thing else As so many beautiful Structures of this Kind are to be seen it is amazing that any Architect should be above imitating them when 'tis plain he cannot equal much less excel them  This Abbey is the Repository of the deceas'd  British  Kings and Nobility and very fine Monuments are seen over the Graves of our antient Sovereigns the Particulars are too long to enter into here  The Monarchs of  Great Britain  are likewise always crown'd here  The Churches in  Southwark  are as follow  The Church of  St Mary  vulgarly called  St Mary Overy  and  St Saviour  in  Southwark  is a noble  Gothick  Pile having Three Ayles running from East to West and a Cross Ayle after the Manner of a Cathedral  The newbuilt Church of  St George Southwark  makes a handsome Appearance    St Thomas  's is a neat and convenient Building    St Olave  's is also newbuilt    St John  's vulgarly call'd  Horsleydown  Church is one of the Fifty new ones  The Church of  St Mary Magdalen Bermondsey  is a neat Structure    ChristChurch  is newbuilt as is also    RotherhithChurch  but the particular Description I have not room for  VII Of  St James  's  Palace  the  ParliamentHouse WestminsterHall  c  THE Palace of  St James  's tho' the Winter Receptacle of all the Pomp and Glory of this Kingdom is really mean in Comparison of the glorious Court of  Great Britain  The Splendor of the Nobility the Wealth and Greatness of the Attendants the Oeconomy of the House and the real Grandeur of the whole Royal Family outdoes all the Courts of  Europe  and yet this Palace comes beneath those of the most petty Princes in it altho' there cannot be in the World a nobler Situation for a Royal Palace than  Whitehall  And it is with some Concern that we see so fine a Spot become a Sacrifice to private Spirit so much of it being given away to particular Families as makes more remote than we might otherwise expect it to be the Hope we might justly have entertained of seeing a Palace built there worthy of the Glory of our Monarchs  Many Plans have been drawn for the rebuilding of this Palace but the most celebrated Draughts are those of  Inigo Jones  and may be seen in Mr  Campbell  's  Vitruvius Britannicus  and Mr  Kent  's Edition of  Jones  's Works The last of these if executed would for Magnificence and Beauty transcend even the Temple of  Solomon  if we are to form a Judgment from the Plans given of that famous Edifice But 'tis a Question whether the Expence would not exceed that of  St Peter  's at  Rome  which cost Forty Millions of  Roman  Crowns  As the Court is now stated all the Offices and Places for Business are scatter'd about here and there  The Parliament meets as they used to do while the Court was at  Westminster  in the King's Old Palace nor can it be said but the Place is made  tolerably convenient for them and is still more so of late Years than it used to be for the  Court of Requests  is intirely newbuilt and made a noble Room and other Conveniencies are added The House of Commons meet in the Chapel of the Palace at  Westminster  dedicated to St  Stephen  and fitted for this Purpose by that admirable Architect Sir  Christopher Wren    The House of Lords is a venerable old Place tho' it must be said to be much streightened in the several Avenues to it and Rooms above it and particularly the matted Gallery the Lobby the back Ways the King goes to it are very short of the requisite Dignity or Convenience of the Place and of the Glory of a King of  Great Britain  who there meets the Peers and Commons of his Realm who together constitute the most august Assembly in the World  WestminsterHall  a very noble  Gothick  Building in which are held the Courts of Justice is said to be the largest Room in the World its Roof which is the finest of its Kind that can be seen is Feet wide And here is held the CoronationFeast of the Kings and Queens of  England  also the Courts of Chancery King's Bench and Common Pleas and above Stairs that of the Exchequer But it must be confess'd that it makes no very advantageous Appearance without resembling at a Distance a great Barn of Feet long within it is filled with Booksellers Shops and those of other Trades tho' the Alteration lately made in the Chancery and King's Bench Courts at the upper End of the Hall and those for the Common Pleas on the Righthand of it give it a much better Appearance than it had before  Adjoining to the Hall are kept the numerous Offices belonging to the Exchequer of  England  some of them very dark and inconvenient and such as to  a Stranger would afford a no very remote Idea particularly in some of the Avenues from Office to Office of the dismal Mansions to which MoneyTransactions often are thought to bring the devoted Subjects of  Plutus    VIII Of the Statues and other publick Ornaments in and about the Cities of  London  and  Westminster    THIS Article we insert rather for the sake of the Number of the Statues  c  than their Excellency tho' some of them must be allow'd to be very valuable  The Brass Statue of K  James  II in the Habit of a  Roman Caesar  in the  PrivyGarden  at  Whitehall  is a very beautiful one and can hardly be outdone by any modern Performance of that Kind in  Europe    A fine Brass Bust of King  Charles  I done by  Panini  a famous  Italian  Master of Sculpture is placed over the Passage at the upper End of  WestminsterHall  adjoining to the Court of King's Bench which tho' little observed is very curious  The Statue in Brass of King  Charles  I on Horseback at  CharingCross  is a curious Piece tho' not perfect according to the Notion of some Criticks  In the Centre of  Sohosquare  is the Statue of King  William  III with Four Figures representing the  Thames  the  Medway  the  Severn  and the  Humber  but the Piece is not extraordinary  On the Front of  Montaguhouse  the Four Cardinal Virtues Also in the Garden in Metal a curious Figure of a Gladiator and likewise a  Venus  and a  Satyr    The Busts over the Entrance of the Prince of  Wales  's Octagon at  Carltonhouse  are fine  In  Grosvenorsquare

the Theatre is also the Statue of Sir  John Cutler  carv'd in Stone A fine Busto of Dr  Harvey  is also newly erected in the Front of the Hall  Another of King  Charles  II in a Niche is also to be seen in that Part of  Christ'sHospital  fronting  Greyfriers  as are also Two of King  Edward  VI  in different Parts of that Hospital Also the Statue of Sir  J More    In the Front of  St Bartholomew's Hospital  next  Smithfield  which is a very handsome Gateway is a Statue of King  Henry  VIII done in a very good Taste  In  Aldersgate  King  James  I on Horseback well carv'd in  AltoRelievo  also the Prophets  Samuel  and  Jeremiah    On  Newgate  in both Fronts are the Figures of  Justice Liberty Mercy Peace Plenty  and  Truth    In  MercersChapel  in the Front  Charity  and

Southside are Two fine Statues of King  Charles  I and King  Charles  II A Statue of King  Charles  II in a  Roman  Habit in the Centre of the Area is a very noble Performance Also in Two Places of the  Exchange  Statues of Sir  Thomas Gresham  one of them deserves a better Situation than the dark Corner in which it is placed under the Piazza of the Northwest Angle just regarding the  Turkey  Walk with a Bale of Silk by him  The Two Figures over the Gate of  Bethlem Hospital  one representing a Person melancholy mad the one raving are inimitable Performances by  Cibber    On the Pediment

Statue of King  William  III with the following Inscription on its Pedestal  Ob Legibus Vim  Judiciis Auctoritatem  Senatui Dignitatem  Civibus Universis Jura sua  Tam Sacra quam Civilia restituta  Et Illustrissimae Domus HANOVERIANAE  In Imperium Britannicum Successionem  Posteris confirmatam  Optimo Principi  GULIELMO TERTIO  Conditori suo  Grato Animo posuit dicavitque  HUJUS AERARII SOCIETAS

Civil and Religious Rights and assuring to Posterity the Succession of the most illustrious House of  HANOVER  to the Throne of  Great Britain  The Society of this BANK has gratefully placed and dedicated this Statue to the most excellent Prince  WILLIAM III  their Founder    in the Year of Christ    and of this Building the First  The noble Collections made by several of our  English  Nobility and Gentry from abroad would afford a curious Article in this Place but our Design is to give an Account of Things as they are in and about this great City  IX Of the Gates of  London  and  Westminster    THE Gates of the City of  London  are seven besides Posterns Two of them were demolish'd at the Fire but beautifully rebuilt These are  Ludgate  and  Newgate    Ludgate  is a Prison for Debt for Freemen of the City only  Newgate  is a Prison for Criminals both in  London  and  Middlesex  and for Debtors also for  Middlesex  being the County Gaol  Moregate  is also rebuilt and is a very beautiful Gateway the Arch being near Twenty Feet high which was done to give room for the City Train'dbands to go through to the Artillery Ground where they muster and that they might march with their Pikes advanced for then they had Pikemen in every Regiment as well in the Army as in the Militia which since that is quite left off This makes the Gate look a little out of Proportion to those who know not the Occasion of it  Cripplegate  is very old and makes but a mean Figure  Bishopsgate  is newly rebuilt but not with the Elegance that might have been wish'd  Aldersgate  and  Aldgate  both make a very handsome Appearance  Most of these Gates are given by the City to the chief Officers to live in and are very convenient Dwellings  TempleBar  is the only Gate which is erected at the Extent of the City Liberties and this was occasion'd by some needful Ceremonies as at the Proclaiming any King or Queen of  England  at which Time the Gates are shut The Herald at Arms knocks hard at the Door the Sheriffs of the City call back asking Who is there Then the Herald answers  I come to proclaim  c according to the Name of the Prince who is to succeed to the Crown and repeating the Titles of  Great Britain France  and  Ireland  c at which the Sheriffs open and bid them welcome and so they go on to the  Exchange  where they make the last Proclamation  There was formerly another Gate belonging to the City of  London  called the  PosternGate  at  Towerhill  but it being partly demolish'd by Time it is now turned into private Buildings  Westminster  had no less than Five Gates and all standing within a small Compass of Ground as first The noble  Gothick  Gate at  Whitehall  which is left standing for the Beauty of its Workmanship Secondly A Gate a little farther where  Kingstreet  begins which was a good old Structure and pull'd down a few Years ago to inlarge the Passage Thirdly A Gate where now  Unionstreet  is communicating  Kingstreet  with the  New Palaceyard  and this has been several Years demolish'd and the said little Street built where it stood Fourthly A Gate leading from  New Palaceyard  to  St Margaret'slane  which has been lately demolish'd to inlarge that Passage by which the King goes to the House of Lords Fifthly The  Gatehouse  near the Westend of the Abbey which is an old Building  used for the publick Gaol of the City of  Westminster    To these we may also add the  Watergate  at  Westminster  in  New Palaceyard  near which is begun to be erected the new Bridge  X Of the publick and private  Prisons    THERE are in  London  and its far extended Bounds notwithstanding we are a Nation so fond of Liberty more publick and private Prisons and Houses of Confinement than in any City in  Europe  The Publick ones are as follow  Publick  Gaols  The  Tower    Newgate  Ludgate  King's Bench  The  Fleet    Bridewell  Marshalseas  The  Gatehouse    Two  Counters  in the City  One  Counter  in the Burrough  St Martin's le Grand  The  Clink  formerly the Prison to the  Stews    Whitechapel  Finsbury  The  Duchy    St Catharine's  Baledock  Littleease  New Prison  New Bridewell  Tothillfields Bridewell  Night Prisons called  Roundhouses  c  Tolerated  Prisons  Bethlem  or  Bedlam    Above  Sponginghouses    Private  Madhouses    The Serjeant at Arms's Officers Houses  The Blackrod Officers Houses  c  The Admiralty Officers Houses  c  Pesthouses  Tipstaffs Houses  Chancery Officers Houses  These private Houses of Confinement are pretended to be like little Purgatories between Prison and Liberty Places of Advantage for the keeping of Prisoners at their own Request till they can get Friends to deliver them and so avoid going into publick Prisons tho' in some of them the Extortion is such and the Accommodation so bad that Men chuse to be carried to Prison directly  XI Of the Markets of  London    AND That of  Smithfield  for Cattle is without question the greatest in the World no Calculation of the Numbers of Horses Oxen Cows Calves Sheep  c  can be made This Market is held every  Monday  and  Friday    There is also a great Market or rather Fair for Horses in  Smithfield  every  Friday  in the Afternoon where very great Numbers of Horses and those of the highest Price are sold weekly  The Flesh Markets are  Leadenhall Honeylane Newgate Clare Shadwell Southwark Westminster Spitalfields Whitechapel Brook Bloomsbury Newport St James  's  Hungerford  and now lately the new Market at  Fleetditch  as also another for which a Patent was granted  May  to be held on  Monday Wednesday  and  Friday  weekly at  Brookfield  by  Mayfair  in the Parish of  St George Hanoversquare  for Meat Herbage  c  At all these Markets a Part is set by for a  Fishmarket  and a Part for an  Herbmarket  notwithstanding which there are the following particular Fish and Herbmarkets  viz  Fishmarkets at  Billinsgate Fishstreethill  and  Old Fishstreet    Herbmarkets  Coventgarden  and till within this little while  Stocksmarket  which is removed to the  new one at  Fleetditch  to make room for a Mansionhouse for the Lord Mayor of this City  At the  Three Cranes  are also Markets for Cherries Apples and other Fruits  Cornmarkets are at  Bear Quay  and  Queenhith    Mealmarkets at  Queenhith Hungerford Ditchside  and  Whitecrossstreet    Haymarkets at  Whitechapel Smithfield Southwark  the  Haymarketstreet Westminster  and  Bloomsbury    Leathermarket at  Leadenhall    Hides and Skins at  Leadenhall  and  Wood'sclose    Coalmarkets at  Roomland  and  Billinsgate    Baymarket at  Leadenhall    Broadclothmarket at  Blackwellhall  A Grant for a new Market near  Grosvenorsquare  is now  Anno  obtained    The last Three are without Doubt the greatest in the World of those KindsThere are moreover Multitudes of Coalmerchants who have Coalwharfs from the  Hermitage  one Way to the  Horseferry  and  Westminster  another which may be deemed so many Markets tho' not publick ones  These Markets are so considerable in themselves that they merit a larger and more particular Description than I have room for I shall however briefly observe of them That of the fifteen Fleshmarkets for Provisions Seven of them are of antient Standing but the others are erected since the Increase of the City The old ones are  Leadenhall Whitechapel Newgatemarket Southwark Clare St James  's and  Westminster  to which some add  Honeylane  and these are so considerable have such Numbers of Buyers and such an infinite Quantity of Provisions of all Sorts Flesh Fish and Fowl that especially with regard to  Leadenhall  no City in the World can equal them  The great Market called  Leadenhall  of which a certain  Spanish  Embassador said There was as much Meat sold in it in one Month as would suffice all  Spain  for a Year contains Three large Squares every Square having several Outlets into divers Streets and all into one another The first and chief is called the  Beefmarket  which has two large Gates one into  Leadenhallstreet  one into  Gracechurchstreet  and two smaller  viz  one by a long paved Passage leading into  Limestreet  and one under a Gateway from the second Square In this Square every  Wednesday  is kept a Market for raw Hides tann'd Leather and Shoemakers Tools and in the Warehouses up Stairs on the East and Southsides of the Square is the great Market for  Colchester  Bays  The second Square is divided into two Oblongs in the first is the Fishmarket and in the other a Market for Country Higglers who bring small Things as Pork Butter Eggs Pigs Rabbets Fowls  c  In the North Part of the Fishmarket the Place being too large for the Fishmongers Use are the Stalls of the Town Butchers for Mutton and Veal the best and largest of which that  England  can produce are to be bought there and the East Part is a Fleshmarket for Country Butchers  The third and last Square which is also very large is divided into Three Parts round the Circumference is the Buttermarket with all the Sorts of Higglery Goods as before the South Part is the Poultrymarket and the Baconmarket and the Centre is an Herbmarket And there have been lately still more Conveniences and Additions made to this prodigious Market which we have not room to particularize  All the other Markets follow the same Method in proportion to the Room they have for it  There are Two Cornmarkets  viz Bearquay  and  Queenhith  To the first comes all the vast Quantity  of Corn that is brought into the City by Sea from the Counties which lie commodious for that Carriage and here Corn may be said not to be sold by Cartloads or Horseloads but by Shiploads and except the Cornchambers and Magazines in  Holland  when the Fleets come in from  Dantzick  and  England  the whole World cannot equal the Quantity bought and sold here for no Quantity can be wanted either for Home Consumption or for Foreign Exportation but the Cornfactors who are the Managers of this Market are ready to supply it  Queenhith  is chiefly for Malt the Barley of which takes up the Ground of so many Hundred thousand Acres of Land in the Counties of  Surrey Bucks Berks Oxford Southampton  and  Wilts  and is called West Country Malt  It is true there is a very great Quantity of Malt and of other Corn too brought to some other Places on the River and sold there  viz  to  Milfordlane  above the Bridge and the  Hermitage  below the Bridge but this is but in general a Branch of the Trade of the other Places  It must not be omitted that  Queenhith  is also a very great Market for Meal as well as Malt and perhaps the greatest in  England    The Vessels which bring this Malt and Meal to  Queenhith  are worthy Observation They are remarkable for the Length of the Vessel and the Burden they carry and yet the little Water they draw for some of those Barges carry above a Thousand Quarters of Malt at a time and yet do not draw Two Feet of Water and a Thousand Quarters of Malt must be granted to be at least a Hundred Tons Burden and some of these large Barges come as far as from  Abington  which is about One hundred and Fifty Miles from  London  if we measure by the River  The next Market which is more than ordinary remarkable is the Coalmarket at  Billinsgate  This is kept every Morning on the broad Place just at the Head of  Billinsgatedock  and the Place is called  Roomland  from what old forgotten Original it has that Name History is silent I need not except for the sake of Strangers take Notice that the City of  London  and Parts adjacent as also all the South of  England  is supplied with Coals called therefore  Seacoal  from  Newcastle upon Tine  and from the Coast of  Durham  and  Northumberland  This Trade is so considerable that it is esteemed the great Nursery of our Seamen I shall have occasion to say more of it in my Account of the Northern Parts of  England  The Quantity of Coals which one Year with another are burnt and consumed in and about this City is supposed to be about Chalders every Chalder containing Bushels and generally weighing Weight  Most of these Coals are bought and sold on this little Spot of  Roomland  and tho' sometimes especially in case of a War or of contrary Winds a Fleet of to Sail of Ships comes up the River at a time yet they never want a Market The Brokers of these Coals are called  Crimps  the Vessels they load their Ships with at  Newcastle Keels  and the Ships that bring them  Cats  and  Hags  or  Hagboats Flyboats  and the like  The Increase of this Consumption of Coals is another Evidence of the great Increase of the City of  London  for within a few Years past the Import of Coals was not in the River of  Thames  so great by very near half  It must be observed that as the City of  London  occasions the Consumption of so great a Quantity of Corn and Coals so the Measurement of them is under the Inspection of the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen and for the Direction of it there is  allowed a certain Number of Cornmeters and Coalmeters whose Places are for Life and bring them in a very considerable Income  They have abundance of poor Men imploy'd under them who are also called Meters and are or ought to be Freemen of the City  This is indeed a kind of Tax as well upon the Coals as Corn but the Buyer is abundantly recompensed by being ascertained in his Measure for the sworn Meters are so placed between the Buyer and the Seller and have so many Eyes upon them being besides Men of Character that there is hardly ever any room for Complaint on this Head  XII Of the Publick Schools and Libraries  WE must be very brief in this Article nor have we room to say anything of the private Schools which are hardly to be number'd  Near the Abbey at  Westminster  is the Royal  Freeschool  founded by Queen  Elizabeth  it is not outdone even by those of  Winchester  and  Eton  for the excellent Scholars it has produced and is in a very flourishing Condition Several good Houses and even Streets are lately built in its Neighbourhood  St Paul's  School founded by Dr  Colet  Dean of  St Paul's  is a fair Foundation for Boys to be taught  gratis    Merchant Taylors  School was founded by Sir  Thomas White  Founder of  St John's  College  Oxon  for Scholars to be taught  gratis  more for Half a Crown and another for Five Shillings a Quarter and has Fellowships established in  St John's  College for Scholars elected from this School  Another excellent School was founded at  Mercerschapel  by that Company  To say nothing of upwards of Charity Schools upheld by the benevolent Contributions of charitable Persons also the Mathematical and other Schools at  Christ's Hospital  which I have not room to be more particular in  As to the LIBRARIES I can only mention 'em likewise in a cursory manner Those at  Sioncollege  the  Temple  and other Inns of Court  Castleyard  near the  Meuse  the  King's  c deserve more particular Mention than we can give them In  Redcrossstreet  near  Cripplegate  an handsome Building was erected  Ann  by the late Dr  Daniel Williams  a Dissenting Divine for a publick Library for the Use of the Dissenting Ministers of  London    The valuable Collections called the  Cotton Library  is so well known that we shall only mention the great Disaster that befel it in the Year when a Fire happened not thro' Overcare we may be sure which burnt and defaced a great Number of valuable Manuscripts But most happily it was discovered and extinguished before it made so great a Destruction as was at first apprehended The learned Keeper of this inestimable Treasure Dr  Bentley  Master of  Trinitycollege Cambridge  whose Labours have done so much Honour to the Commonwealth of Learning was the first we are told to express to some of his Friends who came to condole with him the  publick  Loss the great Joy he conceived that all his  own Works  had escaped the Ravages of that furious Element which had been so little complaisant to many curious Pieces of Antiquity I would studiously avoid all illnatur'd Insinuations but wish that with all the Excellencies which adorn this learned Man's Character the Age in which he lives might be able to hand down his Fame to succeeding Times free from that private Spirit and Narrowness of Mind of which his Enemies accuse him If he deserves not the Illwill of such he  has to comfort himself that Envy always pursues true Merit and so may make himself easy If he does we will venture to say that 'tis a Pity that any Man's listing himself either on this or that Side as to Party should shield him from deserved Censure  The inestimable Collections made by the Earl of  Oxford  the late Lord  Sunderland  c are rather private than publick and so come not under our Notice  XIII Of the Shipping in the  Thames  and the Trade carry'd on by means of that noble River  THE whole River from  Londonbridge  to  Blackwall  is one great Arsenal nothing in the World can be like it The great Buildingyards at  Schedam  near  Amsterdam  are said to outdo them in the Number of Ships which are built there and they tell us that there are more Ships generally seen at  Amsterdam  than in the  Thames    I will not say but that there may be more Vessels built at  Schedam  and the Parts adjacent than in the River  Thames  but then it must be observed  That the  English  build for themselves principally the  Dutch  for all the World  That almost all the Ships the  Dutch  have are built there whereas not one fifth Part of our Shipping is built in the  Thames  but abundance of Ships are built at the Seaports in  England  such as at  Newcastle Sunderland Stockton Whitby Hull Gainsborough Grimsby Lynn Liverpole Yarmouth Alborough Walderswick Ipswich  and  Harwich  upon the East Coast and at  Shoreham Arundel Brighthelmston Portsmouth Southampton Pool Weymouth Dartmouth Plymouth  besides other Places on the South Coast  That we see more Vessels in less Room at  Amsterdam  but setting aside their Hoys Bilanders and Schouts which are in great Numbers always there being Vessels peculiar to their Inland and Coasting Navigation you do not see more Ships nor near so many Ships of Force at  Amsterdam  as at  London    That Part of the River  Thames  which is properly the Harbour and where the Ships usually deliver or unload their Cargoes is called the  Pool  and begins at the Turning of the River out of  Limehouse Reach  and extends to the  Customhouse  Quays In this Compass I have had the Curiosity to count the Ships as well as I could  en passant  and have found about Sail of all Sorts not reckoning Barges Lighters or Pleasureboats and Yachts but of Vessels that really go to Sea  It is true the River or  Pool  seemed at that time to be pretty full of Ships as also that I included the Ships which lay in  Deptford  and  Blackwall  Reaches and in the Wet Docks but then I did not include the Men of War at the King'syard and in the Wet Dock at  Deptford  which were not a few  In the River there are from  Battlebridge  on the  Southwark  Side and the  Hermitagebridge  on the City Side reckoning to  Blackwall  inclusive  Wet Docks for laying up Merchantships  Dry Docks for Repairing Merchantships  Yards for Building Merchantships  Including the Buildings of Lighters Hoys  c  but excluding all Boatbuilders Wherrybuilders and above Bridge Bargebuilders  To enter into any Description of the great Magazines of all manner of Naval Stores for the furnishing those Builders would be endless 'tis sufficient to add That  England  is an inexhaustible Storehouse of Timber and all the Oak Timber and generally  the Plank also used in the Building these Ships is found in  England  only and that principally in the Southern Counties near us as particularly  Berks Bucks Surrey Kent Sussex  and  Suffolk  and very little is brought farther  XIV Of the Manner by which the City is supply'd with Water  NO City in the World is so well furnished with Water as  London  for their necessary Occasions there as well as for the extinguishing of Fires when they happen  By the great Convenience of Water which being everywhere laid in the Streets in large Timber Pipes as well from the  Thames  as the  New River  those Pipes are furnished with a Fire Plug of which the Parish Officers have the Key and when opened let out not a Pipe but as one may say a River of Water into the Streets so that making but a Dam in the Chanel the whole Street is immediately under Water to supply the Engines  By the great Number of admirable Engines of which almost every Parish has one and some Halls also and several private Citizens have them of their own so that no sooner does a Fire break out but the House is surrounded with Engines and a Flood of Water poured upon it till it is extinguished  The several Insurance Offices of which I have spoken in Article III have each of them a certain Set of Men whom they keep in constant Pay and furnish with Tools proper for their Work and to whom they give Jack Caps of Leather able to keep them from Hurt if Brick or Timber or any thing not of too great a Bulk should fall upon them These Men whom they call  Firemen  make it their  Business to be ready at Call all Hours to assist in case of Fire and it must be acknowledged they are very dexterous bold diligent and successful  There are two great Engines for the raising the  Thames  Water one at the Bridge and the other near  Brokenwharf  and these raise so great a Quantity of Water that 'tis said they are able to supply every House throughout the whole City with a running Pipe of Water up to the uppermost Story  However the  New River  which is brought by an artificial Stream from  Ware  continues to supply the greater Part of the City and that with more Ease than the  Thames  Engines Of this River I shall take farther Notice in my Description of  Hertfordshire  where it takes its Rise  The  Chelsea Waterworks  as they are called are also of no small Use for the new Buildings at that End of the Town and a noble Cut being a large tho' not long River of itself from the  Thames  to near  Buckingham  Gardenwall and a great Reservoir of Water in  Hydepark  produced by the same Undertaking are no small Additions to the great Convenience we are speaking of for the Parts which they respectively serve  Formerly there were several beautiful Conduits in  London  the Water of which was very sweet and good and brought to them at a vast Expence from several distant Springs in large Leaden Pipes some of these were rebuilt since the Fire but now the City is so well supplied with Water that they are either quite demolish'd or intirely out of Use That in  Cheapside  was pull'd down but very lately and a Statue proposed to be built in its Place in Honour to the great King  William  III and it must be own'd that it is one of the most commodious Places for such a Purpose in the whole City But it being set on Foot as some thought by Party on one Side  was rejected from far less laudable Motives by Party on the other  It is a well known Fact that the bringing the  New River  to  Islington  for the Benefit of the City was the Ruin of the first Attempter Sir  Hugh Middleton    The Society of the  Temple  neglected to lay in Water till the Year when a terrible Fire happening in it which burnt down several Houses and the  Middle Temple  Kitchen among the rest that Society agreed with the  New River Water  Company and there are nowfine Conveniencies built for that Purpose in every Court and open Place which are only to be uncovered on occasion of such Accidents This Fire happened  Jan  and in it was consumed one of the most valuable Collections of Antiquity in  England  belonging to  James West    Esq  except the  Cotton  and  Harleian  Library  To sum up my Description of  London  take the following Heads There are in this great Mass of Buildings thus called  London    Two Cathedrals  Choirs for Musick Worship  Parishes  Chapels where the Church of  England  Service is performed  Churches at  Deptford  not taken into the Limits now described  Foreign Churches  Besides Dissenters Meetings of all Persuasions  Popish Chapels and  Jews  Synagogues  There are also Hospitals besides lesser Charities call'd  Almshouses  of which they reckon many of which have Chapels for Divine Service  Colleges  Publick Prisons  Publick Schools called  Freeschools      Charityschools  in  London  and  Westminster  and Miles round  Markets for Flesh  for live Cattle  Herbmarkets  Other Markets  Inns of Court  Fairs  Squares besides those within any single Building as the  Temple Somersethouse  c  Publick Bridges and a new one now Building  A Townhouse or  Guildhall    A  Royal Exchange    Another  Exchange  for Shops  A  Customhouse      Artillerygrounds      Pesthouses    Bishops Palaces  Royal Palaces  XV Of the Christenings and Burials in  London  c Of the Importance of the City of  London  to the whole Kingdom Of its comparative Proportion to the Publick Expence of the Kingdom and the disproportionate Number of Members it returns  LET us now mention something briefly in relation to the yearly Births and Burials of this extended Ci  y from an Account of which Sir  William Petty  thought he might make some Calculations of the Numbers of the Inhabitants And I shall only take Notice that whereas the general Number of the Burials in the Year and farther back were from to in a Year the yearly Bill for the Year amounted as follows  Parishes  Christen'd  Bury'd  In the Parishes within the Walls      In the Parishes without the Walls      In the Outparishes in  Middlesex  and  Surry      In the Parishes in the City and Liberty of  Westminster            Here is to be observed that the Number of Burials exceeding so much the Number of Births is because as it is not the Number born but the Number christened that are set down which is taken from the Parish Register so all the Children of Dissenters of every Sort  Protestant Popish  and  Jewish  are omitted also all the Children of Foreigners  French Dutch  c which are baptized in their own Churches and all the Children of those who are so poor that they cannot get them registered so that if a due Estimate be made the Births may be very well supposed to exceed the Burials one Year with another by many Thousands  London  returns Four Members to Parliament  Westminster  two and these Six with Two for the County of  Middlesex  make the Eight which is all that this exceeding populous County returns altho' every single Ward in  London  is far superior to most of the Boroughs in  England  and really to many of the greater Towns that are represented by Two Members and contributes infinitely more to the Publick Charge and indeed one may ask What are the greatest Part of the Boroughs of  Cornwall  and many in that of  Devon  which Two Counties alone return Members compared to populous Villages one might name in the Neighbourhood of  London  Some of which no doubt would be consider'd were a new Repartition of this kind practicable and many of those peddling Boroughs be obliged to give up to them a Scheme that must be set on foot under a very undesigning and honourable Administration for Reasons too obvious to need particularizing  The following Scheme tho' calculated before the  Union  and consequently before the Members which represent  North Britain  were added to the returned for  England  and  Wales  will set this Matter in a still clearer Light  A SCHEME of the Proportions the several Counties in  England  paid to the Three Shillings AID compared with the Number of Members they send to Parliament  In this Scheme the Proportions are thus considered  viz  That as the whole Kingdom send Members to Parliament so the whole Tax is divided into equal Parts  The  Column shews the Name of the County  How many Parts of the of each County paid  How many Members of the each County send  COUNTIES  P  M  Bedford      Berks      Bucks      Cambridge      Chester      Cornwall *      Cumberland *      Derby      Devon *      Dorset *      Du  ham *      Essex      Gloucester      Hereford      Hertford      Huntingdon      Kent      Lancaster *      Leicester      Lincoln      Midd  esex      Monmouth      Norfolk      Northampton      Northumberland *      Nottingham

All England and Wales         P  M  Note  That the Proportion of the Six Northern and Five Western Counties marked thus * are      And that  Middlesex  and  Essex  are      Cities are included in their respective Counties  XVI The Benefit to the Publick of a good Understanding between the  COURT  and  CITY    HAVING shewn the Grandeur and Importance of this great Metropolis it remains only to observe How necessary it is for the Good of the whole  Kingdom that there should be a right Understanding cultivated between the Administration and that For  There has formerly been a great Emulation between the  Courtend  of the Town and the  City  and it was seriously proposed in a certain Reign how the  Court  should humble the  City  nor was it an impracticable Thing at that time had the pernicious Scheme been carry'd on Indeed it was carried further than consisted with the Prudence of a good Government or of a wise People for the  Court  envy'd the  City's  Riches and the Citizens were ever jealous of the  Court's  Designs The most fatal Steps the  Court  took at that Time to humble the City were The shutting up the  Exchequer  And The bringing a  Quo Warranto  against their Charter But these Things can but be touch'd at here The  City  has outliv'd it all and both the Attempts turned to the Discredit of the Party who pushed them on The  City  is indeed and at all times must be so necessary to the  Court  that no prudent Administration will ever seek Occasions for Misunderstandings with it but will if not infatuated do all in its Power to incourage and increase the Opulence of the  City  which upon any Emergency will be able and willing if not disobliged to support the  Court  and furnish Means to protect the Kingdom against either Foreign or Domestick Enemies  And here having exceeded all Bounds of a Letter for which however the Subject is an Excuse I will close my Account of this famous Metropolis and with it my Letter being Sir  Yours c  LETTER III CONTAINING A Description of Part of  Middlesex  and of the whole County of  Hertford    SIR  _THE Villages round  London  partake of the Influence of  London  as I have taken Notice in the Counties of  Essex Kent  and  Surrey    Hackney  and  Bromley  are the first Villages which begin the County of  Middlesex  East for  Bow  as reckon'd to  Stepney  is a Part of the great Mass This Town of  Hackney  is of great Extent containing no less than Twelve Hamlets or separate Villages tho' some of them now join  viz  Churchstreet  Homerton  Wyckhouse  Grovestreet  Clapton  Marestreet  Wellstreet  Cambridgeheath  Shaklewell  Dalstone  Kingsland  Newington  All these though some of them are very large Villages make up but one Parish and are within a few Years so increased in Buildings and so well inhabited that there is no Comparison to be made  between their present and former State every separate Hamlet being increased and some of them more than trebly bigger than formerly they were  Hackney  is so remarkable for the Retreat of wealthy Citizens that there are at this time near an Hundred Coaches kept in it  Newington Tottenham Edmonton  and  Enfield  stand all in a Line North from the City The Increase of Buildings is so great in them all that they seem to a Traveller to be one continu'd Street especially  Tottenham  and  Edmonton  and in them all the new Buildings so far exceed the old especially in their Value and the Figure of the Inhabitants that the Fashion of the Town is quite altered  At  Tottenham  we see the Remains of an antient Building call'd the  Cross  from which the Town takes the Name of  HighCross  Here is a small but pleasant Seat of the Earl of  Colerain    Highgate  and  Hamstead  are next on the Northside At the first is a very beautiful House built by the late Sir  William Ashurst  on the very Summit of the Hill and with a View from the very lowest Windows over the whole Vale to the City and that so eminently that they see the Ships passing up and down the River for Twelve or Fifteen Miles below  London    As the County does not extend far this way I take no notice of smaller Towns nor is there any thing of Note but Citizens Houses for several Miles except the Chace at  Enfield  which was a very beautiful Place when King  James  I resided at  Theobalds  for the Pleasure of his Hunting and was then very full of Deer and all sorts of Game but it has suffered several Depredations since that and particularly in the Times of Usurpation when it was stript both of Game and Timber and let out in Farms to Tenants for the Use of the Publick  After the Restoration it was laid open again Woods and Groves were everywhere planted and the whole Chace stored with Deer but it is not nor perhaps ever will be what it was  Hampstead  is risen from a little Village almost to a City nor could the uneven Surface inconvenient for Building check the Humour of the Builders for even on the very Steep of the Hill where there's no walking Twenty Yards together without tuging up or straddling down a Hill the Buildings are increased to that Degree that the Town almost spreads the whole Side of the Hill  The Heath extends about a Mile every way and affords a most beautiful Prospect for we see here  Hanslop Steeple  one way which is within Eight Miles of  Northampton  N W to  Landownhill  in  Essex  another way East at least Sixtysix Miles from one another The Prospect to  London  and beyond it to  Bansteaddowns  South  Shootershill  Southeast  Redhill  Southwest and  WindsorCastle  West is also uninterrupted Indeed due North we see no farther than to  Barnet  which is no  ove Six Miles from it  At the Foot of this Hill is an old Seat of the Earls of  Chesterfield  called  Belsize  which for many Years had been neglected but being tenanted by a certain  Projector  who knew by what Handle to take the gay Part of the World he made it a House of Pleasure and Entertainment this brought a wonderful Concourse of People to the Place and they were effectually gratified in all Sorts of Diversion but there being too great a Licence used it alarm'd the Magistrates and now the House is hastening apace to Ruin  Besides the Long Room at  Hampstead  in which the Company meet publickly on a  Monday  Evening to play at Cards  c  Mr  Vipand  the Master of that built in the Year a fine Assemblyroom  Sixty Feet long and Thirty wide elegantly decorated every one who does not subscribe pays half a Crown for Admittance Every Gentleman who subscribes a Guinea for the Season has a Ticket for himself and for Two Ladies Gentlemen and Ladies who lodge in the Town are entertain'd every  Sunday  for  d  each with Tea and Coffee but no other Amusements  I could not be at  Hamstead  without making an Excursion to  Edgworth  a little Markettown on the Road to  St Albans  for 'tis certain that this was formerly the main Road from  London  to  St Alban  's being the famous high Road call'd  Watlingstreet  which reached from  London  to  Shrewsbury  and on towards  Wales    Near this Town the Duke of  Chandos  has built one of the most magnificent Palaces in  England  with a Profusion of Expence and so well furnish'd within that it has hardly its Equal in  England  The Plaistering and Gilding are done by the famous  Pargotti  an  Italian  The great  Salon  or  Hall  is painted by  Paolucci  The Pillars supporting the Building are all of Marble the great Staircase is extremely fine and the Steps are all of Marble every Step being of one whole Piece about Twentytwo Feet in Length  The Avenue is spacious and majestick and as it gives you the View of Two Fronts join'd as it were in one the Distance not admitting you to see the Angle which is in the Centre so you are agreeably drawn in to think the Front of the House almost twice as large as it is  And yet when you come nearer you are again surprised by seeing the winding Passage opening as it were a new Front to the Eye of near Feet wide which you had not seen before so that you are lost a while in looking near hand for what you so evidently saw a great way off  The Gardens are well designed and have a vast Variety and the Canals are very large and noble  The Chapel is a Singularity both in its Building and the Beauty of its Workmanship and the Duke used to maintain there a full Choir and had the Worship perform'd with the best Musick after the manner of the Chapel Royal  Two Miles from hence we go up a smaller Ascent by the great Road when leaving the Street Way on the Right we enter a spacious Common called  Bushyheath  where again we have a very agreeable Prospect On the Righthand we have in View the Town of  St Alban  's and all the Spaces between and further beyond it look like a Garden The inclosed Cornfields make one grand Parterre the thickplanted Hedgerows seem like a Wilderness or Labyrinth the Villages interspers'd look like so many several noble Seats of Gentlemen at a Distance In a Word it is all Nature and yet looks like Art On the Lefthand we see the Westend of  London Westminster Abbey  and the ParliamentHouse but the Body of the City is cut off by the Hill at which  Hampstead  intercepted the Sight on that Side More to the South we have  HamptonCourt  and S W  Windsor  and between both those beautiful Parts of  Middlesex  and  Surrey  on the Bank of the  Thames  which are the most agreeable in the World But I must travel no farther this Way till I have taken a Journey West from  London  and seen what the Country affords that Way  The next Towns adjacent to  London  are  Kensington Chelsea Hamersmith Fulham Brentford Twickenham  c all of them near or adjoining to the River of  Thames  and which by the Beauty of their Buildings make good the North Shore of the River answerable to what I have already describ'd  But here I ought not to omit mentioning the new Bridge from  Fulham  to  Putney  cross the  Thames  which is a handsome wooden Fabrick and as convenient by its many angular Indentings for Footpassengers as for Horses and Coaches A Toll is paid for every one that passes it let it be ever so often in a Day and the Rate pretty much the same as the Ferry used to be And as the Proprietors are said to divide or  l per Cent  from the Profits of it 'tis pity methinks that Footpassengers who cannot wear the Bridge should pay at all  Kensington  cannot be nam'd without mentioning the King's Palace there it was originally an old House of the Earl of  Nottingham  's of whom the late King  William  bought it and then inlarg'd it as we see some of the old Building still remaining in the Centre of the House  The House itself fronts to the Garden Three Ways the Gardens being now made exceeding fine and inlarged to such a Degree as to reach quite from the great Road in  Kensington  Town to the  Action  Road North more than a Mile besides a great Track of Ground out of  HydePark  An artificial Mount is also erected which affords a fine View is planted with Evergreens and has a Seat upon it which turns round with great Ease at Pleasure The noble River that is lately dug in  HydePark  affords a fine View from these beautiful Gardens The first laying out of these Gardens was the Design of the late Queen  Mary  who finding the Air agreed with the King resolved to make it agreeable to herself too and gave the first Orders for inlarging them  The late Queen  Anne  improv'd what Queen  Mary  began and delighted very much in the Place and often was pleased to make the Greenhouse which is very beautiful her Summer Supperhouse  And her late Majesty Queen  Caroline  completed the Whole by the Additions just now mention'd  King  William  Prince  George  of  Denmark  and Queen  Anne  dy'd here  As this Palace opens to the West there are Two great Wings built for receiving such as necessarily attend the Court and a large Portcocher at the Entrance with a Postern and a Stone Gallery on the Southside of the Court which leads to the great Staircase  It is no Wonder the Court being so much at  Kensington  that the Town has increased in Buildings and indeed it abounds with handsome Houses and has a very pretty Square  South of this Town stands  Chelsea  at which Place is the noblest Building and one of the best Foundations of its kind in the World for maimed and old Soldiers built by Sir  Christopher Wren    Here also are the Physickgardens belonging to the Company of  Apothecaries  of  London  In it is lately built a stately and convenient Edifice which serves at the same time for a Greenhouse and Apartments over it for meeting of the Company of  Apothecaries  c and over them are very convenient Apartments which may be used for drying Seeds of Plants  c  As this Ground was made a Present by Sir  Hans Sloane  they have erected in the new Building a Statue of that Gentleman and intend to make in due Time an Opening down to the River which will have a beautiful Effect upon the  Thames  and receive no less Grace from it On the Pedestal of this Statue is an Inscription expressing the Company's Gratitude to Sir  Hans    Near the Royal Hospital was till very lately a neat and beautiful House and Gardens built by the late Earl of  Ranelagh  but they are now quite destroyed being sold out in Parcels to Builders and other Purchasers  Sir  Robert Walpole  has a fine House here and good Gardens adjoining to the Hospital adorn'd with noble Pictures  c  In short there is an incredible Number of fine Houses built in all these Towns within these few Years which in other Places would pass in a manner for Palaces and most of the Possessors whereof keep Coaches  Among these are the late Lord  Peterborough  's at  ParsonsGreen  Lord  Halifax  's at  BushyPark  Earl of  Bradford  's Earl of  Strafford  's Earl of  Shrewsbury  's Earl of  Burlington  's  SuttonCourt Chiswick  Mr  Barker  's Lord  Wilmington  's General  Whetham  's  HollandHouse  near  Kensington  situated on a fine Eminence and which now is taken by the Lord  Bruce  who is making it once more a delightful Habitation the late Secretary  Johnson  's at  Twickenham  and Multitudes of others  But I must not pass over so slightly the noble Seat of the Right Hon the Earl of  Burlington  at  Chiswick  and yet I can only mention cursorily some of its Beauties as the River his Lordship has dug in his Gardens a very fine one indeed from the Earth of which he has formed a noble Mount next the Road or rather a Terrace from which the whole Country may be viewed and which serves at the same time for a Defence to his Gardens on that Side and is planted to the Road with all manner of sweet Shrubs Roses Honeysuckles  c  that yield in the Season a delightful Fragrance as well to the Passengers as to those on the Terrace the magnificent Buildings in Imitation of antient Temples  c  interspersed in the Gardens the beautiful Bridge over the River in it the fine Walks the unbounded Prospects several curious Statues a noble Obelisk delicate Vistas and the sumptuous Buildings adjoining to the old House commanding a fine View to the River which with the Pictures and valuable Curiosities withinside altogether exceed Description  In the Village of  Hamersmith  which was formerly a long scattering Place full of Gardeners Grounds  with here and there an old House of some Bulk we see now great Numbers of fine Houses and a continued Range of a great Length which makes the main Street  I have now travers'd the best Part of  Middlesex  a County made rich pleasant and populous by the Neighbourhood of  London  The Borders of the County have Three Markettowns  Stanes Colbrook  and  Uxbridge  this last is a pleasant large Town full of good Inns as the others are and famous in particular for having abundance of fine Seats of Gentlemen and Persons of Quality in the Neighbourhood and also for a vain Attempt made in the great Civil War to settle the Peace of these Nations by a Treaty here I should never have done were I to pretend to describe tho' ever so slightly the large Towns on both Sides the River as  Lambeth  Battersea  Wandsworth  Fulham  Putney  Barnet  Roehampton  Hamersmith  Mortlack  Brentford  Kew  Richmond  Isleworth  Twickenham  Padington  Acton  Ealing  where a new Church is just finish'd and others all crouded and surrounded with fine Houses or rather Palaces of the Nobility Quality and Gentry of  England    There are but Three more Markettowns in the County  viz Brentford  the Countytown  Edgworth  and  Enfield    And now I enter the County of  Hertford  a fruitful Soil as it is managed for 'tis certain it is more indebted for its Fertility to the Sagacity and Industry of the Husbandman than to Nature Rich Meadows are seldom found here for it affords not any large Rivers the Arable hath generally too much Gravel or too much Clay but these last cold  and wet Lands have been within these Forty Years greatly improv'd by draining off the Rainwater which stagnated on the clayey Surface as in a Cup and chilled the Roots of the Corn an Invention called  Bushdraining    The County is wellwater'd for the Conveniency of the Inhabitants tho' the  Lea  is the only navigable Stream in it which has its Rise in  Bedfordshire  of which more anon But this County assumes the Honour of giving Rise unto several Rivers  viz  the Parish of  Tring  to the  Thames  which leaving the County at  Putenham  goes by  Ayleshury  to  Thame  and thence by  Wheatleybridge  to  Dorchester  and falls into the  Isis    The County may be divided into Three Parts pretty equal by Two great Roads one Part lying between the North Road which goes thro'  Hertford  to  Nottingham  c and the Borders of  Cambridgeshire  North and those of  Essex  East Another Part lying between that Road and the other which leads thro'  St Alban  's to  Coventry  and  Chester  and the third lying between this last Road and the Borders of  Middlesex  South and those of  Bucks  West  I shall begin with the last at  EastBarnet  a Thoroughfaretown of Note and well supplied with Inns it lies high and pleasant and was formerly frequented for its medicinal Waters and now for its Swinemarket It has in its Neighbourhood several very handsome Houses of the  Londoners  and which are the more pleasant by being so near the Chace  Totteridge  is near it also and is a very pleasant Village It is situated on a fine Eminence looking to the North over the  St Alban  's Road into the Forest and on the South over the  Edgware  Road to  Harrow  c It is very clean and has several very good Houses in it The Road from  Hampstead  here is extremely pleasant and so well repaired that in the worst Season there is scarce any Water or Dirt  remaining in it and as it lies not on any great Road there are no heavy Carriages passing that Way therefore a small Expence annually well laid out will always keep this Road in excellent Repair  CheapingBarnet  lies a little North in the  St Alban  's Road and is remarkable for the decisive Battle fought there on  Easterday  between the Houses of  York  and  Lancaster  in which the great Earl of  Warwick  styled  Makeking  was killed with many of the prime Nobility and Men The Place supposed to be the Field of Battle is a green Spot near  KicksEnd  between  St Alban  's and  Hatfield  Roads a little before they meet The Manor is in the Property of the Duke of  Chandois  A handsome Row of Six Almshouses for so many Widows founded by  James Ravenscroft    Esq  in with a little Furniture to each is in the Street Queen  Elizabeth  built a Free Schoolhouse of Brick in the same Street where Nine Children are taught  gratis  and all other Boys at Five Shillings the Quarter  About Two Miles N W from hence on the Lefthand lies  Durhams  formerly the Seat of the  Austins  but is now the Property of the Earl of  Albemarle  who purchased it of Sir  John Austin  and has since greatly beautified the Seat by laying most of the neighbouring Fields belonging to the Estate into a Park and turning and repairing of the Roads The House stands on an Eminence situated in a small Valley surrounded with pretty high Hills at a little Distance so that in the Summer Months it is an agreeable Retirement but the Soil all round it being a strong Clay all the Rain which falls in Winter being detained on the Surface renders the Situation very cold and moist Add to this the Want of good Water and Timber near the House except the young Trees which have been planted by his Lordship and upon the Whole it cannot be esteemed a good Seat  Idlestrey  or  Elstre  is a Village on the  Roman Watlingstreet  on the very Edge of  Middlesex  but it is chiefly noted for its Situation near  BrocklyHill  by  Stanmore  which affords a lovely View cross  Middlesex  over the  Thames  into  Surrey  Near this is  Kendale  Wood where formerly was found an old Flint Wall so hard as not to yield to the Strokes of the Pickax as likewise an Oven Mr  Philpot  digging his Canal and Foundations for his Buildings upon the Spot of the old City  Suellaniacis  found many Coins Urns and other Antiquities They have a Proverb here relating to the Antiquities  No Heart can think nor Tongue can tell  What lies 'tween  BrockleyHill  and  Pennywel  Pennywel  is a Parcel of Closes across the Valley beyond  BrockleyHill  where Foundations are discernible and where they say has been a City  About Two Miles further West lies  Watford  a Markettown Seventeen Miles from  London  upon the  Colne  where it hath Two Streams which run separately to  Rickmersworth  Several Almshouses belong to this Town and an handsome Freeschool built in and finish'd by  Elizabeth Fuller  Widow and in the Church are several handsome Monuments The Town is very long having but one Street which is the publick and so is extremely dirty in Winter and the Waters of the River at the Entrance of the Town are often so much swelled by Floods as to be unpassable and the Bridge designed as the Road at such times is so much out of Repair that it is very dangerous for any Carriages of Burthen to pass over it which is a very great Disadvantage to the Town  Cassioberry  the Seat of the Earl of  Essex  is the next thing that occurs worth notice and is elegant The Situation is the best in the County upon a dry Spot within a Park of a large Extent the  House is built in Form of an H the Middle and the East Wing is modern and in good Repair but the West Wing is very old and by no means corresponding with the other Parts of the House The Front faces the Southeast and looks directly on the House in  MoorePark  on which the late Mr  Stiles  expended such great Sums of Money and which has a noble Look from  Cassioberry  House In the Front of the House is a fine dry Lawn of Grass which immediately after the heaviest Winter Rains may be rode or walked on as on the driest Downs and a little below the House is a River which winds through the Park and in the driest Seasons constantly runs with a fine Stream affording great Plenty of Trout Crayfish and indeed most other kinds of freshwater Fish On the North and East Sides of the House are large Woodwalks which were planted by the famous  Le Notre  in the Reign of  Charles  II The Woods have many large Beech and Oaktrees in them but the principal Walks are planted with Limetrees and these are most of them too narrow for their Length and too regular for the modern Taste On the other Side of the River the Ground rises to a considerable Height which affords an agreeable Variety part of which being covered with stately Woods appearing at a proper Distance from the Front of the House have a fine Effect to the Eye In short the whole Spot if a small Expence was bestow'd to improve and put it more in the modern Taste would be one of the finest Places near  London    Near  Cassioberry  is a pleasant Seat purchased by the late Lord  Raymond  called  Langleybury    Rickmersworth  is a Markettown within Three or Four Miles West of  Watford  It gave Birth to Sir  Thomas White  MerchantTaylor of  London  who founded  Gloucester  Hall and  St John  's College  in  Oxford  Here are Two Almshouses one for Four the other for Five Widows  We visited in this Neighbourhood  MorePark  with a fine House in it of the late Duke of  Monmouth  standing upon the Side of the Hill facing  Cassioberry  on the other Side the River It has been allowed one of the best Pieces of Brickwork in  England  Sir  William Temple  commends the Garden as one of the best laidout in  England  The Duchess of  Monmouth  on whom it was settled by Marriage sold it in to  BenjaminHeskins Stiles    Esq  who has made it a magnificent Edifice having built a South Front of Stone with Colonnades by which an Opening is made thro' the Hill that once obstructed its View toward  Uxbridge  A North Front is also erected and the Hill towards  Watford  cut thro' for a Vista The Inside of the House is also adorned with admirable Work of Painting In digging this Hill Veins of Seasand with Muscles in it were found  AbbotsLangley  Twentytwo Miles from  London  situated about Three Miles North of  Cassioberry  in a good Air and Soil is remarkable for the Birth of an  English  Pope  Nicolas Brakespear  by the Title of  Adrian  IV The Emperor  Frederick  held his Stirrup while he dismounted He was choaked as some say by a Fish and as others by a Quinsy but it is an indelible Stain on his Memory that when sovereign Pontiff he suffer'd his Mother to be maintain'd by the Alms of the Church of  Canterbury    We proceeded to  KingsLangley  so called because  Henry  III built himself a Royal House here of which the Ruins still exist and here was born and buried  Edmund de Langley  Duke of  York  Fifth Son of  Edward  III and his Wife  Isabel  youngest Daughter of Don  Pedro  King of  Castile  was also buried here and the Tomb is in the Church of this Place  We next went to  Hempsted  a little further North and about Twentythree Miles from  London  a Bailiwick Corporate Town It has the greatest Cornmarket in the County or perhaps in  England  in which  l  a Week are frequently returned for Meal only Eleven Pair of Mills stand within Four Miles of the Place which bring a great Trade to it but the Road is by this means so continually torn that it is one of the worst Turnpikes round about  London    A little North of  Hempsted  we turn'd West and came to  Great Barkhamsted  about Twentyfour computed Miles from  London  It is a very antient Town which for many Hundred of Years has been one of the Crown Manors which granted to it many very ample Privileges It is now annexed to the Dukedom of  Cornwall  and as such appropriated to the Princes of  Wales  The Castle and Manor are at present held by Lease from the Prince by  Edward Carey    Esq  which was obtained by his Ancestors of Queen  Elizabeth    Barkhamsted  has evidently been a  Roman  Town by the Name of  Durobrivae  and probably the Castle stands upon a  Roman  Foundation  Roman  Coins are frequently dug up there It is most pleasantly inviron'd with high and hard Ground full of Hedgerows Pastures and Arable tho' situated upon a Southside of a Marsh It extends itself far in handsome Buildings and a broad Street In the Time of the Heptarchy it was the Residence of the Kings of  Mercia  and here  Wightred  King of  Kent  and  Mercia  in the Year held a Parliament here also King  Ina  's Laws were publish'd  The Castle was judiciously set on the Northside of the Town on dry Ground amongst Springs and made exceedingly strong by the  Saxons  It was rebuilt by  Moreton  Earl of  Cornwall  Brother to  William the Conqueror  and razed for Rebellion in his  Son's Time and so with the Manor fell to the Crown  Henry  II kept his Court here and granted great Privileges to the Place The Castle was afterwards rebuilt as it is thought in the Reign of King  John  for the  Dauphin  of  France  in Conjunction with the Barons besieg'd it and the Defendants surrender'd not till they had the King's Orders for it  When the Castle was demolish'd a large House was built out of its Ruins which is beautifully situated What now remains of it is but the third Part and the Back of the great House for the other two Thirds were destroyed by Fire in the Reign of  Charles  I It was in King  James  's Time a Nursery for that Prince's Children and Prince  Henry  and Prince  Charles  were bred up there and in the Time of the late Troubles Colonel  Axtel  a Parliament Officer held it It is now in the Possession of the  Roper  Family  The Corporation sunk in the War between the King and Parliament In King  Charles  II's Time an Attempt was made to revive the Charter but it was dropt This Body Politick is now reduced to a Skeleton like the Castle which is only to be known by its Moats and Walls  The Castle contains within its first Moat Four or Five Acres There is again a Division by another Moat The South Part consisting of about Two Acres is upon a Level with most of the outward Walls and Chimneys remaining Towards the North across a Moat is a high Hill or Keep capable of defending itself against the former if possessed by an Enemy The Traces of the Bridge of Communication and the Moat dividing these Two Places of Strength are continued to the grand one that takes in the whole Scite of the Fortification The Remains of the Bridge for Entrance from the Town  are visible answering exactly to the other as the North of the first Area which led to the Hills  In this Town was the famous Interview between  William the Conqueror  and the  English  Nobility in his March towards  London  after his Victory over  Harold  He passed the  Thames  at  Wallingford  and was going forward to  St Albans  when the stout Abbot  Frederick  stopp'd his March by Trees  c  till he could get the  English  Nobility together and then he made him swear to keep inviolably the good and antient Laws of the Kingdom yet he took away all their Lands and divided them among his hungry  Normans    This Town gives Name to the Deanry The Church is handsome dedicated to St  Peter  it has had many Chapels and Oratories On the Pillars of the Church are the Eleven Apostles with each of them a Sentence of the Creed and St  George  killing a Dragon on the Twelfth These were whited over by the Zeal of the late Times and are but lately come to Light  The Chapel of  St John  is used only by the Master Ushers and Scholars of the FreeSchool  St Leonard  's Hospital was at the Southeast End of the Highstreet and  St James  's Hospital at the other End The Free GrammarSchool was built by Dean  Incent  of  St Paul  's It is a handsome Brick Structure with an Apartment at one End for the Master at the other for the Usher and ChantryClerk It was Twenty Years in Building  They have had other large Benefactions which we have not room for  Tring  being Twentyeight computed Miles from  London  is a small Markettown stands upon the Extremity of  Hertfordshire  next to  Buckinghamshire  East of and near the  Ikeningstreet    It is very antient and was formerly a Royal Manor but now possessed by  William Gore    Esq  who has made a Park of Acres of which Part is on the  Chiltern  In it is a beautiful Wood inclosed lying close to the  Ikeningstreet  Mr  Gore  has beautified and wainscotted the Church in a most elegant Manner and gives  l per Ann  for a CharitySchool The Church is a handsome Pile of Building with a Ring of Six Bells The Chancel was wainscotted by Sir  Richard Anderson  It is decent and capacious and worthy a Choir Both Church and Chancel are paved with FreeStone the Pillars are painted the Pulpit and sounding Board are of fine Inlaidwork and a handsome Vestry is under the Belfry  Among other Monuments is a magnificent one for Sir  William Gore  and his Lady with Inscriptions to their Honour but too long for a Place here  From  Tring  I passed next Eastward and came to  GadesdenLittle  where I had heard was a fine Prospect and I wanted not Curiosity to see it This Vill has  CawleyWood  and  IvingoHills  on the Northwest  AldburyCliffs  on the Southwest  DunstableDowns  to the North The Prospect I mean is from one Part of this Parish to which a Common of fine Turf leads under the Duke of  Bridgwater  's shady Park and a noble one it is of Three Counties worthy of the Pencil of the greatest Artist in Landschape  The Variety of Woods Cliffs Arable and Pasture are charming but they must be tempted to half a Mile's pleasant Exercise to get to the beautiful Scene  CawleyWood  belonging to the Duke of  Leeds  is a small Covert a Mile from hence at the Top of a Hill in  Bucks  one of the greatest Landmarks in the South of  England  which overlooks Eleven Counties It stands as a Monument to shew notwithstanding  all the modern Improvements that Nature will not be outdone by Art  Now I am on this Subject I shall just mention  Penleylodge  for a most delightful Retirement to a Man who wants to deceive Life in an Habitation which has all the Charms Nature can give There is behind a large Common of fine Turf bounded on a Wood on the West to which if one ascend a Quarter of a Mile he has a View of  Northamptonshire  and  Warwickshire  From the House a Semicircular Prospect of  Bedfordshire Middlesex  and  Bucks  a bended one towards  Ivingo  and  AldburyCliffs  with the shady Woods of the Dukes of  Leeds  and  Bridgwater  seeming to hang over the Rivulet called  Bulborn    The Manor of  Aldbury  lies Northeast of  Tring  and in the Way to  Gadesden  It belongs to the Duke of  Leeds  whose Father married the Heiress of the Family of  Hyde  and so does  MuniboroughHill  lie in the Way from  Aldbury  to  LittleGadesden  and affords a handsome Prospect  Ashridge  stands near  Aldbury  but in  Bucks  an antient Mansionhouse and fine Park belonging to the Duke of  Bridgwater    Gadesden  is famous for the Birth of  John de Gadesden  who flourished in the Beginning of the Fourteenth Century the first  Englishman  who was a Court Physician and of whose Skill  Chaucer  makes honourable mention in his  Doctor of Physick  prefix'd to his  Canterbury Tales  though Dr  Freind  from  John  's own Books will not allow him to deserve it There are several Monuments in the Chancel of this Church of the  Bridgwater  Family whose finely situated Seat and Park at  Ashridge  formerly a Royal House of Pleasure and where  Edward  I held a Parliament in the Nineteenth Year of his Reign is in this Parish but in the County of  Bucks  The Duke is Lord of this Manor as also of that of  GreatGadesden    I cross'd over a Slip as I may call it of  Bucks  which runs into  Hertfordshire  between  Aldbury  and  KensworthGreen  which lies a little South of the Road which leads from  St Alban  's to  Dunstable  and is a Situation surprisingly fine about half a Mile in Length a good Turf and level with  WhipsnapeWoods  on the Back of it and Rows of high Trees on the other Side Nothing but Sky is to be seen from it one Way and the other we have only a View of the Top of a Grove at  MarketCell  It seems to claim a Preference of every Place in the County for a Cell yet never had one on it it comes very little short of the famous  Guy  's Cliff near  Warwick  There the shady Grove and rolling Stream below it make a beautiful Scene for Solitude here the Woods and Trees afford Shade enough and the pure circumambient Ether with nothing in View but the Tops of Trees would make a Hermit think himself in another World  Here I came into the Road and so turned Southeast for  St Alban  's thro'  Flamstead  Parish where is a wellbuilt and delightful Seat of Sir  ThomasSaunders Sebright  Bart on a rising Ground in the middle of a Park It is called  Beechwood  Manor from the great Number of fine Beechtrees which were formerly growing here some of which are yet remaining on the Sides of the Park The Soil of this Park is for the most part dry the Surface being shallow on a strong or chalky Bottom which renders the Turf very fine and short and very pleasant for the Exercise of either riding or walking It was formerly a Nunnery for a Prioress and Ten Nuns independent of any other Convent and then called  St Gyles in the Wood  A very serious Inscription in  Flamstead  Church on a Monument of one of the  Saunders  Family may  be worth transcribing as it certainly is a Piece of sound Doctrine in which every living Man may find an Use  "He that looks hereon may consider how fleeting all worldly Comforts are and how great a Vanity it is to place his Affection thereon Such Things there are as worldly Comforts 'tis true but they ought to be look'd on as  little Streams  and whoever delights in them more than in the FOUNTAIN from whence they proceed may soon find them dry and vanished The Truth of which he that wrote this hath sensibly found and wills others to place their Affections chiefly on that OBJECT OF LOVE which is unchangeable and is the Centre of all true Joy and Felicity"  Pursuing still the same Course along the great Road we came next to  St Alban  's the capital Town of  Hertfordshire  famous for deriving its Name from the Protomartyr of  England  who suffered so early in the fourth Century 'Tis governed by a Mayor Burgesses a Steward and a Chamberlain and is a peculiar Liberty both for Ecclesiastical and Civil Government  The Town rose out of the Ruins of old  Verulam  of which so much has been said by Mr  Camden  and others that we refer to them for Particulars In that great Man's Time the Ruins afforded much more for the Observation of the Curious than now for they are since dug away for mending the Highways The first  Verulam  was stormed and taken by  Julius Caesar  And here  Cassibelan  a famous  British  King then kept his Court The first Destruction of the Place is supposed to have been by  Boadicea  the famous  British  Queen who cut off  Romans  in one Battle and the second which was erected on the Ruins of the other in the Wars between the  Britons  and  Saxons  and almost  infinite are the Numbers of Antiquities here dug up  The Origin of  St Alban  's was owing to the Monastery built by  Offa  King of the  Mercians  to the Memory of St  Alban  in Expiation of his barbarous Murder of  Ethelbert  King of  EastAngles  whom he had treacherously inveigled to his Court on Pretence of marrying his Daughter and the same  Offa  it was that built  Hertford  Cathedral and dedicated it to  St Ethelbert  and made a Journey to  Rome  as further Penance where he was absolved tho' he kept the murder'd Prince's Dominions and joined them to his own  Of all the Monasteries in  England  none could outshine this Its Revenue was great and its Privileges still greater In the Royalties it had from its Founder and the Episcopal Powers from the Pope none came up to it The mitred Abbot had Precedency of all in  England  and subject to no Ecclesiastical Power but the Pope immediately and he had Episcopal Jurisdiction over both Clergy and Laity in all the Lands belonging to his Monastery From first to last they were Fortyone in Number and many of them Persons of great Accomplishments and high Birth the th of which tho' not highborn was Cardinal  Wolsey  The last Abbot was  Richard Boreman  who at the Dissolution quietly surrendred on the Royal Command and accepted of a Pension for Life of  l    s  and  d  Two bloody Battles were fought near this Place between the Houses of  York  and  Lancaster  the first upon the d of  May  in which the  Yorkists  got the Day the second on  ShroveTuesday  in the th of  Henry  VI when the martial Queen  Margaret  overcame the  Yorkists  who had then the King in their Power and fought under the Sanction of his Name  But we must not dismiss this Subject without giving some brief Particulars of the famous Abbey Church We have before observed that it was founded by King  Offa  but it has been rebuilt in Whole or Part several times The Town purchased it at the Dissolution for  l  which prevented so noble a Fabrick being pulled down and torn to Pieces for making Money of the Materials and it is made a Parish Church for the Borough The High Altar is a curious Piece of  Gothick  Architecture  Within the North Entrance is  Offa  on his Throne Underneath  Fundator Ecclesiae circa annum    Quem male depictum et residentem cernitis alte  Sublimem solio  MERCIUS OFFA  fuit  That is  The Founder of the Church about the Year  Whom you behold illpainted on his Throne  Sublime was once for MERCIAN OFFA known  In the most Eastern Part of the Church stood the Shrine Six Holes remain in the Pavement where the Supporters of it were fixed This Inscription is still to be seen  S ALBANUS VEROLAMENSIS ANGLORUM  PROTOMARTYR  Junij    On the South Side the Shrine in the Wall of the South Isle is Duke HUMPHREY's Monument with the Arms of  France  and  England  quartered and a Ducal Coronet In Niches on the South Side are Kings the Niches on the other Side have none remaining  Piae Memoriae V Opt Sacrum  Hic jacet  HUMPHREDUS  Dux ille Glocestrius olim  Henrici sexti Protector fraudis ineptae  Detector dum ficta notat miracula coeci

fell beneath an envious Woman's Wile  Both to herself her King and Kingdom vile  Who scarce allow'd his Bones this Spot of Land  Yet 'spite of Envy shall his Glory stand  It is but little above Years ago that digging for a Grave the Stairs leading down to the Vault where the Body lies were discovered  In the Vault is a leaden Coffin with the Body preserved by the Pickle it lies in except the Legs from which the Flesh is wasted the Pickle of that End being dried up On the Wall at the East End of the Vault is a Crucifix painted with a Cup on each Side of the Head another at the Side and a fourth at the Feet The Vault is very neat and hath no offensive Smell The Coffin we are told had an Outside of Wood which is intirely gone  The West End of the Choir hath a noble Piece of  Gothick  Workmanship for the Ornament of the High Altar Capt  Polehampton  about Years ago gave an Altarpiece which represents the last Supper  There are many curious Medals and Coins to be seen in the Church which have been dug out of the Ruins of old  Verulam    This noble Fabrick hath wanted its Abbot's Zeal and Purse too for Repairs since it hath been a Parish Church The Roof was preserved by Contribution of the Nobility and Gentry of  England  many of whose Arms are put up on this Occasion and Money has been collected several times besides for its Support indeed such a fine Fabrick must too often stand in need of such Helps as there is no settled Fund to maintain it  There are Three Churches in the Town at present besides the Abbey Church  viz St Michael  's abovementioned  St Peter's  and  St Stephen  's  There were also formerly belonging to this Town  St German  's Chapel  St Mary Magdalen  's Chapel  St Julian  's Hospital the Hospital of  St Mary des Prees  the Nunnery of  Sopwell  c But they are all demolished and secularized There was also in the Town the Parish Church of  St Andrew  but that had dropp'd down before the Dissolution  Near this Place is  Sopwel  Nunnery where they say King  Henry  was married to  Anne  of  Bolen  In the Heart of the adjoining Corporation stood one of Queen  Eleanor  's Crosses demolished by the Inhabitants  In the Neighbourhood of  St Alban  's is  Gorhambury  where is a Statue of King  Henry  VIII with other Things worthy a Traveller's Curiosity It is now the Seat of the Lord  Grimston  but what it will be always most famous for is that the Manor is the paternal Estate of that Mirror of all Ages and  Ornament of his Country for Learning  Francis Bacon  created Lord  Verulam  and Viscount of  St Alban  's once Lord Chancellor of  England  who first revived Experimental Philosophy Of whose Merits Rise and Fall we shall say nothing but refer our Readers to his Life now lately in published and prefixed to a new and beautiful Edition of his Works written by the ingenious Mr  Mallet  Sir  Thomas Meautys  who had been the Secretary of this wonderful Man and to whom he convey'd this Estate in Gratitude erected a Monument for him in  St Michael  's Church in this Town sitting thoughfully in an Elbowchair  The Monument bears this Inscription  Francisc Bacon  Baro de  Verulam Sti Albani  Viceco  Seu notioribus Titulis  Scientiarum Lumen Facundiae Lex  Sic sedebat  Qui postquam omnia Naturalis Sapientiae  Et Civilis Arcana evolvisset  Naturae Decretum explevit  Composita solvantur  An Dom    Aetat    Tanti Viri Mem  Thomas Meautys  Superstitis Cultor  Defuncti Admirator  Thus translated  Francis Bacon  Baron of  Verulam  and Viscount of  St Alban  's or by his more known Titles The Light of the Sciences and the Law of Eloquence was thus accustomed to sit who after having unravelled all the Mysteries of Natural and Civil Wisdom fulfilled the Decree of Nature  That Things joined should be loosed  in the Year of our Lord and of his Age  To the Memory of so great a Man this was erected by  Thomas Meautys  who reverenced him while living and admires him dead  The Manor of  Kingsbury  was sometimes the Residence of the  Saxon  Monarchs whence its Name It had a Castle which was kept up till King  Stephen  's Time when it was demolish'd and the Scite given to the Abbey  The Duchess Dowager of  Marlborough  hath a Seat here built by the late Duke upon the River  Verlam  which runs thro' the Garden and who also built handsome Almshouses at the Entrance of the Town  The following remarkable Inscription and Character is cut upon the Pedestal of a fine Statue of the late Queen  Anne  carved by the noted Mr  Rysbrach  and erected at  St Alban's  at the Expence of the Duchess in Gratitude to the Memory of that excellent Princess  QUEEN  ANNE  was very graceful and majestick in her Person Religious  without Affectation  She always meant well She had no  false Ambition  which appeared by her never complaining at King  William  's being preferred to the Crown before her when it was taken from the King her Father for following such Counsels and pursuing such Measures as render'd the  Revolution  necessary It was her greatest Affliction to be forced to act against him even for Security Her Journey to  Nottingham  was never concerted but occasion'd by the great Consternation she was under at the King's sudden Return from  Salisbury    She always paid the greatest Respect to King  William  and Queen  Mary  never insisted upon any one Circumstance of  Grandeur  more than what was  established  in her Family by King  Charles  II tho' after the  Revolution  she was presumptive Heir to the Crown and after the Death of her Sister was in the Place of Prince of  Wales    Upon her Accession to the Throne the  Civil List was not increased  The late Earl of  Godolphin  Lord High Treasurer of  England  often said that from Accidents in the Customs and Lenity in the Collection it did not arise one Year with another to more than Five hundred thousand Pounds a Year  She had no  Vanity  in her Expences nor bought any  one Jewel  in the whole Time of her Reign  She paid out of her Civil List many Pensions granted in former Reigns which have since been  thrown upon the Publick    When a War was necessary to secure  Europe  against the Power of  France  she contributed in one Year towards the War out of her Civil List One hundred thousand Pounds in Ease of her Subjects  She granted the Revenue arising from the First Fruits to augment the Provisions of the poorer Clergy  She never refused her private Charity to proper Objects  Till a few Years before her Death she never had but Twenty thousand Pounds a Year for her Privy Purse At the latter End of her Reign it did not exceed Twentysix thousand Pounds a Year which was much to her Honour because it is subject to no Account And as to her Robes it will appear by the Records in the Exchequer that in Nine Years she spent only Thirtytwo thousand and Fifty Pounds including the Coronation Expence  She was extremely wellbred treated her chief Ladies and Servants as if they had been her Equals Her Behaviour to all that approached her was decent and full of Dignity and shewed  Condescension  without  Art  or  Meanness    All this I know to be true  SARAH MARLBOROUGH  MDCCXXXVIII  At  Colney  is also a very handsome Seat of Sir  HenryPope Blunt  's standing about a Quarter of a Mile North of the Road It seems to be very large and the Fields and Meadows about it make it very pleasant in Summer  Having thus gone over the first Part I proposed of this Country which lies South and Southwest of  St Alban's  Road I shall now bend my Course Northeast towards  Hertford  and from thence Northwest to take in such Part of the middle Division as lie between the Two capital Roads on that Side of  Hertford  reserving that which lies East of it for my Return towards  London    The next Town in my Way is  Hatfield  computed Miles from  London  it is a Markettown but much more famous is  Hatfield  House which lies near it from whence  Edward  VI and Queen  Elizabeth  were both conducted to the Throne having resided here for some time King  James  made an Exchange of this Manor in the fourth Year of his Reign for that of  Theobald  's as hereafter mentioned with Sir  Robert Cecil  afterwards Earl of  Salisbury  who built this magnificent House and made the Vineyard in the Park thro' which the River  Lee  hath its Course adorning that Garden The Rectory of  Hatfield  is esteemed one of the best in  England    Winwich  in  Lancashire  and another in  Durham  have larger Revenues but this has a better Situation  Saundridge  which lies a little Northwest of  Hatfield  deserves to be mentioned as it gave Title of Baron to the late great Duke of  Marlborough  and it now belongs to his illustrious Relict a Descendant of the Family of  Jennings  of this Place But one Thing must be observed withal that when I was there last the Steeple lay buried in its own Rubbish as it had done for Years together and the Bells  hung in the Church behind the Door and this I suppose continues to be its present State  NorthMymms  stands a little East of  Colney  and is remarkable for having in its Neighbourhood the Seat of the late Sir  Joseph Jekyll  Master of the Rolls in Right of his Lady who was Heir to her late Brother the great Lord  Somers  It has a most delightful Prospect The Body of that noble Lord lies interred in the Chancel of the Church here without any Inscription in Allusion as one would expect to his Motto  Prodesse quam conspici  This Seat is now the Property of his Grace the Duke of  Leeds  who has put a great Part of the House and Gardens in good Repair and is his Retirement from  London  during any short Interval that may happen in the Sessions of Parliament  We come now to  Hertford  the County Town computed Miles from  London  a Corporation governed by a Mayor and Burgesses It is pleasantly situated in a wholsome Air and a dry Vale having a good weekly Market well stored with Corn and all sort of Provisions It is very antient and is built in the Form of a Y with a Castle in the Middle of the two Horns It contains several Streets and Lanes well filled with handsome newbuilt Houses In  Edward  III's Time it had petitioned to be disburden'd of the Expence of sending Two Members to Parliament on their Inability to pay their Representatives Wages But  Jac  I they petitioned to be restored to their Right and succeeded  There is a Free Grammar School for the Children of this Town erected by  Richard Hale    Esq  in King  James  I's Reign The House being rebuilt a few Years ago is a very good one Of the Five Churches  Hertford  once had there are but Two remaining  viz AllSaints  and  St Andrew  's  Near  Hertford  is a Seat of Governor  Harrison  situated on a Hill which commands a Prospect of  the Country round it as is likewise in its Neighbourhood a Seat of the  Clarks  very delightfully situated too  The Earl  Cowper  has a handsome Seat near  Hertingfordbury  in the Neighbourhood of  Hertford  built by his Father the great Lord High Chancellor of that Name who erected in the Churchyard a Tomb for his Mother with an Inscription to her Honour in this Churchyard is also the Tomb of Mrs  Elizabeth Culling  Heiress of a Family of that Name  The Manor of  Gobions  lies a little North of  Hertford  and will be for ever famous on Occasion of its being the Familyseat of the great Sir  Thomas More  Lord High Chancellor of  England  in the Reign of  Henry  VIII who took off his Head for refusing to acknowlege his Supremacy It is now the Property of Sir  Jeremy Sambroke  Bart who for the Beauty of its Gardens as well as the House has made the Place one of the most remarkable Curiosities in  England    A little still farther North at  Wotton  is the Mansionhouse of the  Botelers  nobly situated on a rising Ground and watered with small Streams which fall into the  Beane  on the South of it It stands in a Park beautifully consisting of Hills and Flats and renowned for as good Timber as the Island produces About Years since one Tree was sold for  l  Horses were had to draw one Part of it when slit and out of it the  Cutwater  to the  Royal Sovereign  was made Another called the  WalkingStick  might some Years ago have been sold for Fifty Guineas but was decaying when I was there by the burrowing of Rabbets under it There is a good Freeschool in this Village for poor Children with some of whom  l  is to be given Apprentice  Stevenage  is computed Miles from  London  and lies Northwest of  Hertford  It is a small Markettown the Church stands upon a Hill and consists  of a Nave and Two Isles and the Chancel hath a Chapel on each Side In the Steeple is a Ring of Six Bells Here is a good Freeschool as well for Petit as Grammar Scholars  Walkern  is near it Northeast on the River  Beane  I mention it on Account of the poor  Jane Wenman  who within these Years was tried for a Witch the last we hope that ever will undergo such a Trial in  England  for the old obsolete Law against Witches was very lately repealed Mr Justice  Powell  got a Reprieve for the poor Creature after the Jury had found her guilty contrary to his Directions She lived several Years afterwards on an Allowance from the Parish The poor Wretch had been frighted into a Confession that she was a Witch and thereupon was committed by Sir  Harry Chauncy  of  Yardlybury  who would fain have had her retract and pacify her Accusers This Gentleman was one of the deprived Judges of King  James  II but it is said he never sat as Judge but one Day He wrote  The Antiquities of  HERTFORDSHIRE  It is reported likewise that another Woman being tried before Judge  Powell  who among other Things that constituted her a Witch had laid to her Charge That she could fly  Ay  said the Judge  And is this true Do you say you can fly Yes I can  said she  So you may if you will then  replied the Judge  I have no Law against it  And at the Trial of  Jane Wenman  the Court being full of fine Ladies the old Judge very gallantly told the Jury  "They must not look out for Witches among the Old Women but among the Young"  I passed by  Beningtonplace  the Seat of the antient Family of the  Caesars  There was formerly a Castle there the Hill on which it stood still remains deep ditched  At  Siffivernes  in  Codicote  Parish in the Year was a most prodigious Walnuttree covering  Poles of Ground The Weight of the Boughs at last cleft the Trunk to the Ground Mr  Penn  then Lord of the Manor had Loads of Planks out of it a Gunstock Maker at  London  had as much as cost  l  Carriage There were Loads more of Roots and Branches This was attested by  Edward Wingate  before a neighbouring Justice of Peace to whom Mr  Penn  declared he had been offered  l  for the Tree And  Jasper Docura  of the Parish attested That when he was Years old the Compass of both his Arms would not reach round it at Eight times  Hitchin  is a Markettown lying in a Bottom out of any great Road distant from  London  computed Miles and

Fortyone There are many Monuments in it A good Freeschool and other charitable Benefactions have been made to the Town  I could not miss taking notice of  Hexton  on the Northwest Edge of the County next  Bedfordshire  where was a Battle between the  Danes  and  Saxons  some Remains of which are visible between this Place and  Luton  as large Barrows  c  Half a Mile to the South of this Town is a fortify'd Piece of Ground called  Ravensborough Castle  The Camp is a sort of Oblong containing about Acres the  Fortification intire Nature has so well strengthened it that Men may defend it against a very great Army it is incompassed with a Valley and a very steep Hill inaccessible by an Army anywhere but at the Point of Entrance which is by a gradual Ascent of a Quarter of a Mile  The  Beryslade  a House possessed by  John Cross    Esq  tho' low and in the Dirt is now an agreeable Summerhouse which it owes chiefly to  St Faith  's Well a fine Spring at  Ravensburg  A moory Piece of Ground where the Spring rises is cut into Canals which are stocked with Trouts many of them Inches long These having been used to take their Food from the Master's Hand out of a Bowl with a long Handle to it come rolling up to the Surface The Bottom is white either from Chalk or Sand and so transparent that every Fish may be seen that comes out of its Hole To preserve them from Groping the Banks are wharfed and in some Places supported with Timber so that the Fish can shelter themselves underneath and a Man must have his Head and Shoulders in Water who stoops down to them From hence the Water feeds a large Canal in the Garden stored with Carp and Tench and there might be made Basons or Canals to any Dimensions  Near  Hexton  is a Square  Roman  Camp upon a Promontory just big enough for the Purpose and under it is a fine Spring  Lilibo  is a fine Plot of Ground upon a Hill where a Horserace is kept It lies a little South of  Hexton  just by the  Ikening    Near  Pirton  Church has been a Castle of the  Saxons  or  Normans  with a Keep  I proceeded next to  Baldock  situated on the  Ikeningstreet  as it leads from  Dunstable  to  Royston  It is a large Markettown computed Miles from  London  It is of chief Note for its many Maltsters  The Church stands in the Middle of the Town it is a handsome highbuilt Edifice with a Ring of Six good Bells It has Three Chancels but the Two outward are rather Chapels The  Ikeningstreet  about  Baldock  now appears but like a Fieldway Between  Baldock  and  Icleford  it goes thro' an Intrenchment consisting of the Remains of a  British  Town now called  Wilburyhill Icleford  retains the Name of the Street which at this Place passes a Rivulet with a strong Ford wanting Reparation  This Street quite to the  Thames  in  Oxfordshire  goes at the Bottom of a continued Ridge of Hills called the  Chiltern  being Chalk and the natural and civil Boundary between the Counties of  Hertford  and  Bedford  very steep Northward  As the  Ikeningstreet  and the  Foss  traversed the Kingdom from Southwest to Northeast parallel to each other and  Watlingstreet  crossed these quite the contrary Way with an equal Obliquity the  Hermanstreet  passed directly North and South This Word is  Saxon  and signifies a Soldier or Warrior which Name it obtained from being a Military Way  It begins at  Newhaven  at the Mouth of the River  Ouse  in  Sussex  and passes on the West Side of that River thro'  Radmil  then thro'  Lewis  by  Isfield  after which it seems to pass over the River at  Sharnbridge  and so proceeds to  East Grinstead  but is lost in passing thro' the great Woods Then thro'  Surry  it goes by  Stanestreet Croydon Stretham  and by its pointing we may conclude was originally designed to pass the  Thames  at the Ferry called  Stangate  by  Lambeth  where it coincides with the  Watlingstreet  There the Road went before  London  became considerable but since that Period the Traces of the Roads near that Capital have grown very obscure The original Road perhaps passes thro' unfrequented Ways near  Enfield  and  Harmanstreet  which seems from thence to have borrowed its Name  On the Eastern Side of  Enfield  Chace by  Bushhill  is a circular  British  Camp upon an Eminence declining Southwest But the antient Road appears upon a Common on this Side  Hertford  by  Ball'spark  and passes the River below  Hertford  then goes thro'  Warepark  and falls into the present Road on this Side  Buntingford  and so to  Royston  where it crosses the  Ikeningstreet  coming from  Tring  thro'  Dunstable  going into  Suffolk  These are the principal Places upon the Two Roads which we thought fit to mention together  At  Baldock  I crossed the North Road and got into the Third Division I proposed next  Cambridgeshire  and  Essex  and when I have passed thro' it I will return back again South and take a View of such Towns as lie on the East Side of the middle Division as I have not been at already  In the Year between  Caldecot  and  Henxworth  several  Roman  Antiquities were dug up Workmen digging Gravel for the Repair of the great Northern Road struck upon some earthen Vessels or large Urns full of Ashes and burnt Bones but rotten near them a human Skeleton with the Head towards the Southeast the Feet Northwest Several Bodies were found in the same Position not above a Foot under the Surface of the Earth and with Urns great or small near them and Patera's of fine red Earth some with the Impression of the Maker at the Bottom also Glass Lacrymatories Ampulla's a Brass Tribulus Six small Glasses Two large Beads of a Green Colour and other Fragments  I went thro' the Village of  Ashwell  which stands not far from  Caldecot  on the Source of the  Rhee  by the Borders of  Cambridgeshire  which breaks out of a Rock here from many Springs with such Force as to form a Stream remarkably clear but so cold that it gripes Horses not used to drink it  The Water here bubbles out at as many Places and as abundantly and in just such a Bottom under a Hill as doth the  Isis  or  Thames  in  Gloucestershire  In  Domesday Book  this Village is called a Borough having Fourteen Burgesses and a Market antiently also it had Four Fairs Mr  Camden  thinks the Village  Roman  and at half a Mile Distance South of this Source of the  Rhee  is a Spot of Ground taken in by a Vallum and generally thought to be one of the  Castra Exploratorum  of the  Romans  it is called  Arbury Banks  and consists of about Acres and  Roman  Coins have been found here but still it wants several Requisites that go to a  Roman  Camp which I have not room to particularize  Ashwellfield  affords a Stone Quarry out of which the Stones of most of the Churches of this Side and the neighbouring Part of  Bedfordshire  have been dug The Church has a handsome Chancel Three large Ayles a lofty Tower at the West End with a Ring of Six Bells and a Chapel on the North Side the Chancel  I now come to  Royston  situated upon the utmost Northern Border of  Hertfordshire  insomuch that Part of it is in  Cambridgeshire  computed Miles from  London  The Fields about this Towns have upon almost every Eminence a Barrow and they lie very thick by the  Ikeningstreet  East of this Town Here was a Monastery founded in Honour of St  Thomas à Becket  as also an Hospital both swallowed up in the Dissolution of  Henry  VIII but the Priorychurch was purchased by the Inhabitants and made a Parishchurch of It consists of a Nave and an Ayle on each Side and a square Tower with a Ring of Five Bells in it  The Town became populous on erecting the present Postroad through it which before ran along the  Erminestreet  thro'  Barkw  iggleswade  It is now a good Town and well  and has  a very great Cornmarket on  Wednesdays  and is full of good Inns In the Year a Schoolhouse was erected here by Contribution of the Town and Country  Two Miles both Ways of  Royston  is chalky Soil about  Puckeridge  it is gravelly in other Places adjoining are Camps and  Roman  Antiquities At  Hadstock  is the Skin of a  Danish  King nailed upon the Church Doors as reported  Royston  was a  Roman  Town before  Roisia  built her religious House here for  Roman  Coins have been dug up near the Spot There seems to be the Stamp of  Roisia  's Cross still remaining at the Corner of the Inn just where the Two Roads meet The Earl of  Oxford  digging Canals at  Wimple  when he had that Seat found many Bodies and rusty Pieces of Iron the Remains of some Battle  And now I bend my Course Southward towards  London    The Church of  Therfield  which lies among the Hills a little South of  Royston  is obliged to  Francis  Lord Bishop of  Ely  once Rector of it who paved the Chancel with Freestone the Area of the Altar with Marble wainscoted the Walls made it into the Form of a Choir and ceiled it with Fretwork 'Tis a Rectory of great Value and is rated in the Firstfruits Office at  l  a Year Till lately was at  Therfield  Furniture of all Sorts for the Use of poor Peoples Weddings such as was at  Braughing  but they are now lost or converted to other Uses even literally to Ploughshares and Peasehooks  Barkway  is a Markettown The Church stands in the midst of the Town with an Ayle on each Side and a Tower with Five Bells and a Turretclock The Creation of the World is painted on one of the Windows In one Pane at Top is a bodily Representation of the Deity as a Man in a loose R  be down to his Feet with the Globe before him  and the Motto under  De operae primae diei  The next Pane has the same with Hands expanded standing on the Firmament in the midst of the Water under which  De opere Secundae diei  The Third has the same Figure amongst green Trees and Herbs the Legend lost and Three other Panes in Order under these The Painting of the Fourth is lost The Fifth has the same Figure with Birds flying about it A Piece of the Sixth remains where Fowls and Beasts are brought to  Adam  to be named Another Window in the North Isle has St  George  slaying a Dragon a Bishop  c  The  Roman  Road called  Erminestreet  passes thro' the Parish of  Amsty  and all the Way upon it we find Remains of Camps and Stations exactly according to the Itinerary The Castle formerly here was said to be built by  Eustace  Earl of  Bologne  at the Conqueror's Command and it is not improbable that there were Fortifications before It consisted of a Keep or round artificial Hill yet remaining with a large and deep Fosse about it the Mount probably made from the Ditch The Barons in King  John  's Time made another Retrenchment South of it which would contain a Garison as numerous as the Castle would hold  Henry  III obliged  Nicolas de Avestic  to demolish the additional Fortification and keep up only the old one  The Church was built in the Reign of  Henry  III as is said out of the Stones of the demolished Fortifications made additional to the Castle It is certainly very old and built with a low Tower in the Middle and Two Ayles The Chancel perhaps was rebuilt with the Materials of the Keep being of later Date It is large and lofty and hath Stalls as if for a Choir  Buntingford  is the next Town and lies in the  Cambridge  Road noted for a great Thoroughfare computed Miles from  London  and owes its Being as a Town to the present Postroad through it to the North The first Mention of it is in the Reign of  Edward  III who gave a Market and a Fair to it It is situated in  Layston  Parish but has a Chapel of Brick built by Contribution for the Inhabitants here Dr  Seth Ward  Bishop of  Salisbury  who died  Jan  built a neat Brickhouse near the Chapel for Four poor Men and Four poor Women who had lived handsomely and came to Decay thro' Misfortunes each of which has Two Rooms below and Two above  Buntingford  Freeschool owes much also to the same worthy Prelate who had his Education in it He built an Hospital at  Salisbury  for Ten poor Widows of Clergymen was a Benefactor to  Layston  gave a good Sum of Money to make  Salisbury  River navigable  l  to be laid out in Land for putting out Three poor Children Apprentices Two out of  Alseden  and One out of  Layston  alternately In short the good Bishop seems to have thought that the Revenues he reaped from the Church ought to have some other more publick Designation than to lift out of Obscurity a private Family  Braughing  lies a little on the East of the Road was antiently next to  Verulam  the most considerable Place in the County and is thought to have been the  Roman Caesaromagum  situated Miles from  London  as by  Antoninus  's  Itinerary  It still has some Ruins of its antient Eminence giving Name to the Deanry and the Hundred On the West Side the  Erminstreet  now the Road to  Cambridge  we find the Ruins of a  Roman  Camp The Church is an handsome Building and hath a Ring of Five good Bells  Near the Churchyard is an old House at present inhabited by poor Families which was given with all Sorts of Furniture for Weddings They brought hither their Provisions and had a large Kitchen with a Caldron large Spits and Drippingpan a large Room for Merriment a Lodgingroom with a Bridebed and good Linen some of which Furniture was in being a few Years ago  This Provision was also at  Therfield  and the Kitchen Utensils but lately lost  We proceeded thro'  Puckridge  a little Hamlet Town but a great Thoroughfare standing on the  Erminstreet  where there are several good Inns for Travellers and came to  Standon  a small Markettown The Church hath Three Ayles the Floor of the Chancel is Seven Steps above that of the Church and the Altar Three Steps above the Chancelfloor  Here we turn'd short to the East to visit  BishopStortford  lying on the Borders of  Essex  Miles from  London  The Conqueror gave this Town and Castle to the Bishop of  London  whence its  Praenomen  and King  John  seized and demolished it for the Offence of the then Bishop who was one of those who published the Pope's Interdict against the Nation The Town in the same Reign was incorporated and returned Members to Seven successive Parliaments The Bishop was restored by the same Prince and Satisfaction made him for demolishing the Castle The Hill or Keep of the Castle is artificial made of Earth carried thither with a Breastwork at Top of Stones and Morter A Bank of Earth leads from it thro' the moory Ground on which it was situated to the Northeast There is a large Wall from the Top of the Hill yet remaining The Bishop's Prison was in being in Bishop  Bonner  's Time tho' all the old Buildings are since demolished But the Castleguard is still paid by several Places to the Bishop besides other Quitrents  The Town is large and wellbuilt it is a Thoroughfare from  London  to  Cambridge Newmarket  and  St Edmundsbury  and full of convenient Inns It is built in the Form of a Cross having four Streets turn'd to the Cardinal Points and the River  Stort  runs thro' it  The Church dedicated to  St Michael  is lofty and stands on high Ground it hath a fine Ring of Eight Bells There were antiently Three Guilds and a Chantry founded here In the Church are Nine Stalls on a Side for a Choir On the North Side the Church is a Gallery for the young Gentlemen of the School built by Contribution upon it Sir  John Hobart  's Arms who was educated there and a great Benefactor to this Work  At the West End is another Gallery built a few Years ago upon which is an Organ and it is observable that there was an Organ in this Church so long ago as in the Reign of  Henry  VII A new Font stands before it with a Pavement of Black and White Marble inclosed with Iron Ralis  There are a great Number of Monuments in the Church particularly one in the North Ayle for Seven Children of  Edward Maphesden  who died of the Smallpox with a  Latin  Inscription deploring that heavy Dispensation  Several Benefactions are bestowed on the Poor of this Town particularly Two Almshouses in  Pottersstreet  But the greatest Ornament of the Town is the School built Years ago by Contribution of the Gentlemen of  Hertfordshire  and  Essex  at the Request of Dr  Thomas Tooke  late Master who also procured several Sums for completing it from the young Gentlemen educated here When this Gentleman engaged in it it was at the lowest Ebb of Reputation but he raised it to a great Degree of Fame and considerably increased the Trade of the Town by the beneficial Concourse that it  brought thither He revived the annual Schoolfeast and charged his own Estate with a yearly Present to the Preacher on that Occasion He died  May  after upwards of Years successful and diligent Labours here By his Interest and Care the Gallery in the Church for the Use of the School was erected He gave a Chalice of  l  Value to the Church and was a great Benefactor to the School Library which is a very good one and was first set on foot by the Reverend Mr  Thomas Leigh  B D who was Vicar of the Church  Anno    The School stands in the Highstreet with the West Front to the Churchyard consisting of Three Rooms which with the Staircase make a square Building The Grammar School takes up half of it all the Front to the Street the other Two are the Library and Writingschool These stand upon Arches under which are a Market and Shops which are the Property of the Parish and here the School was built at the Desire of the Inhabitants who got by it a Covering for their Market and at the same time an Ornament to their Town  Every Gentleman at leaving the School presents a Book to the Library  Hadham Parva  stands a little North of  BishopStortford  and is of chief Note for being the Buryingplace of the  Capels  Earls of  Essex    The Manor of  Rye  in the Parish of  StanstedAbbots  is famous for the Plot called thence  the Ryehouse Plot  said to be formed for assassinating King  Charles  II in his Return from  Newmarket  for which several Persons suffered and among the rest the Tenant of the Place  Rumball  a Man of a daring and intrepid Spirit  Honesdon  separated from  Essex  by the  Stort  deserves to be mentioned for Three Reasons first for its noble Situation upon a gravelly rising Ground  overlooking the Meadows dly for being the Residence of the Children of King  Henry  VIII in whose Hands it was then on account of its good Air and Vicinity to  London  and dly for the Seat of  Robert Chester    Esq  built within these few Years inclosed with a Park It stands upon a beautiful Hill overlooking the Meadows the River  Stort  and Part of  Essex  from the back Front from the other it hath a Prospect over great Part of  Hertfordshire  and is seen from  Cheshunt  Common on one hand as  St Paul  's is from the other At the Entrance of the Avenue it hath a large Basin thro' which runs a small Stream and there is a graceful Plantation of Trees with Variety of Slopes adorned with Statues The same Stream afterwards feeds a Canal  We pursued our Way directly South and came to  Sawbridgeworth  or  Sabsworth  Among several antient Monuments in the Church is an handsome one erected to the Memory of General  Lumly  Brother to the then Earl of  Scarborough  with an Inscription greatly to his Honour As follows  "Here lieth the Honourable HENRY LUMLEY  Esq  only Brother to  Thomas  Earl of  Scarborough  who was in every Battle and at every Siege as Colonel LieutenantGeneral or General of the Horse with King  William  or the Duke of  Marlborough  in Twenty Campaigns in  Ireland Flanders  and  Germany  where he was honoured esteemed and beloved by our own Army by our Allies and even by the Enemies for his singular Politeness and Humanity as well as for all his military Virtues and Capacity He sat long in Parliament always zealous for the Honour of the Crown and for the Good of his Country and knew no Party but that of Truth Justice and Honour He died Governor of the Isle of  Jersey  the th of  October  in the d Year of his Age"  The Manor House of  Pish  bury  in  Sabsworth  Parish deserves to be mentioned on account of its remarkable Strength though built in Queen  Elizabeth  's Time and lofty Rooms It is situated on a clean Soil has handsome Avenues to it with the River  Stort  behind which communicates with the Canals in the Gardens It is in the Possession of the Family of  Gardiner    We then cross'd the Country directly West to  Ware  situated Miles from  London  on the River  Lee  in its Course from  Milford  The Town stands low upon a Level with the River It is a Place of great Trade for all sorts of Grain but chiefly Malt which is conveyed in great Quantities to  London  by the River  Lee  which is navigable from hence and the Barges bring Coals  c  It consists of one principal Street a Mile long and other back Streets and Lanes At an Inn in this Town is the famous great Bed which is Feet square  Ware  being Miles from  London  is the second Post Town from thence on the Northern Road The next is  Royston  Miles further Several Almshouses and a Freeschool and other Charities belong to this Town  Thomas Byde    Esq  Lord of the Manor has a House pleasantly situated in the Park here to which is an Ascent of every Side also a Vineyard newly planted One late Improvement besides many others is a Cut from the  Rib  which by that Means turns that Stream thro' the Park on the South Side which is a fine Nursery and Protection for Trouts  In the North Part of the Town was situated the Priory now in the Possession of the Family of  Hadsley    An eminent Tradesman of  Ware  having lost by Death a favourite Mare which he had had many Years in Consideration of her good Services made in  March  a grand Burying for her and invited near People to it He and his Wife going next the Carcase as chief Mourners were followed by the rest of the Company in Couples and about Four o'Clock she was interred in  Harelanefield  near the Town with great Pomp After which the Company returned and were treated with Plum Cake and Strong Beer at the Mourner's House who expressed great Concern for the Loss of the valuable Creature  At  Blake  's  ware  the most Eastern Part of the Parish is a Seat of  William Plummer    Esq  with a Stream called the  Ash  on the East Front which feeds a Canal and a Garden by the Riverside The chief Gardens are seen from the western Front which being upon a Declivity afford an handsome Prospect that Way  A little South of  Ware  lies  Amwell  a Village famous for giving Rise to the  New River  which proceeding in a direct Course by the Church receives a Spring which flows with great abundance It is Miles from  London  but the Course of the River is computed at It was begun by Sir  Hugh Middleton  but he being ruined by the Project the City of  London  undertook it and by Aid of an Act of Parliament brought it to Perfection The yearly Profit of the River has some Years ago been computed at  l  and the Expence in supporting and keeping it up is said to amount to half the Profit 'Twas divided originally into Shares one Moiety whereof belonged to private Persons and the other to the Crown For King  James  I for the sake of his Palace at  Theobalds  was a great Promoter of it The Crown's Moiety is since come into private Hands who however have no Part in the  Management for the Corporation consists of of the Proprietors of the first Shares  This River in Fact draws most of its Water from the  Lee  which being the Property of the City of  London  that Corporation opposed a Bill brought into Parliament for giving further Powers to the  New River  Company to benefit itself by the  Lee  River But the Opposition availed not and in the Session the Bill passed into a Law  The Governors of the  New River  Company agreed with the Proprietors of the Lands on the River  Lee  for a Cut of Two cubick Feet of Water from the said River at a certain Rate and after the Agreement they told them they would double the Price for a Fourfoot Cut which the Proprietors agreed to not considering the great Disproportion of the Two Cuts And this Cut of the River  Lee  supplies the largest Share of the  New River  Water  We kept along the great Road thro'  Hoddesdon  which is a considerable Markettown and noted also as a Thoroughfare till we came to  Broxbourn  which lies near it on the  New River  a small but pleasant Village situated on a rising Ground having pleasant Meadows down to the River  Lee  On the Lefthand of the Village is  Broxbournbury  the Seat of the Lord  Monson  The House is large and in the old  Gothick  Style and situated in the Middle of the Park which has been planted and beautified of late There are also new Offices erected at a little Distance from the House in a Quadrangle on the same Plan with the King's  Meuse  at  Charingcross  They are placed behind a large Plantation of Trees so that they do not appear until you are near upon them yet are at a convenient Distance from the Mansionhouse which I was informed his Lordship also proposes to rebuild  The Manor of  Theobalds  is in this Neighbourhood where formerly was built a magnificent Seat by Lord  Treasurer  Burleigh  who gave it his younger Son Sir  Robert Cecil  and he exchanged it for that of  Hatfield  at the Desire of King  James  I who made it his Sporting Seat and here ended his Life From this Place  Charles  I set out to erect his Standard at  Nottingham  King  Charles  II made a Grant of it to  Monck  Duke of  Albemarle  and to his Male Issue which failing in his Son  Christopher  King  William  gave it to  Bentinck  Earl of  Portland  in whose Grandson the present Duke it still continues In the late Civil Wars the Palace was plundered and defaced and is become a poor Village from a Royal Residence The great Park which was inclosed within a Wall of Miles Compass by King  James  is now converted into Farms The Place is however popular and the  New River  runs just by and sometimes thro' the Gardens of the Inhabitants In this Neighbourhood  Richard Cromwell  the abdicated Protector passed the last Part of his Life in a very private Manner  Walthamcross  is the next and as you enter  Middlesex  by the North Road the last Place in  Hertfordshire  standing just on the Edge of  Middlesex  It is noted for and takes its Name from the Cross built by King  Edward  I in Honour of his beloved Queen  Eleanor  whose Corps in its Way from  Lincolnshire  to  Westminster  rested here as a Cross was built at every Stage where it rested and  Charingcross  was the last That Princess's Effigies placed round the Pillar and the Arms of her Royal Consort as well as her own  viz England Castile Leon  and  Poictou  are still remaining tho' much defaced  And thus much for the County of  Hertford  with which I conclude myself Sir  Yours c  LETTER IV CONTAINING A Description of Part of  BUCKINGHAMSHIRE  of the County of  OXFORD  and Part of  WILTS    SIR  _I NOW proceed to give you an Account of my next Journey thro' Part of  Bucks  into  Oxfordshire  and shall touch upon some Parts of  Wiltshire  of which I have notyet taken notice  On the Righthand as we ride from  London  to  Uxbridge  or to  Colebrook  we see  Harrow  the Church of which standing on the Summit of an Hill and having a very high Spire they tell us King  Charles  II ridiculing the warm Disputes among some critical Scripturalists of those Times concerning the  Visible  Church of Christ upon Earth used to say This was it  From  Uxbridge  we proceeded on the Road towards  Oxford  and came to  Beaconsfield  a small Town on the Road to  Oxford  full of good Inns and situated on a dry Hill famous for the Residence of Mr  Edmund Waller  eminent for his poetical Talent  Then we went on to  Wickham  commonly call'd  High  or  Chipping Wycoomb  from  Coomb  a  British  Word for Valley This is a large Town consisting of one great principal Street branching out into divers small ones It is full of good Houses and Inns being a great Thoroughfare from  London  to  Oxford    Not far from  Wickham  lies  Amersham  or  Agmondesham  a small Markettown very antient and a little beyond it you go thro'  Chesham  a little inconsiderable Markettown and likewise  Wendover  a mean dirty corporate Town From hence we proceeded to  Aylesbury  which is the largest and best Town in the CountyIt stands on a Hill but the Country round it is low and dirty It consists of several large Streets and has a handsome built Markethouse which stands in a kind of Quadrangle It has also a Townhouse where the Assizes and Sessions and other publick Meetings of the County are held Provisions are here cheap and plentiful which is owing to the rich Vale adjoining It was a strong Town in the Beginning of the  Saxons  Time and a Manor Royal in that of the  Conqueror  's who parcell'd it out under this odd Tenure That the Tenants should find  Litter or Straw for the King's Bedchambers  Three times a Year if he came that Way so often and provide him Three Eels in Winter and Three Green Geese in Summer which would be but a mean Entertainment at Bed and Board for a King in these Days  All round this Town is a large Track of the richest Land in  England  extended for many Miles almost from  Tame  on the Edge of  Oxfordshire  to  Leighton  in  Bedfordshire  and is called from this very Town  The Vale of Aylesbury  It is famous for fattening Cattle and Sheep and 'tis frequent that they sell a Ram here for Breeding for Ten Pounds Here it was that conversing with some Gentlemen who understood Country Affairs for all Gentlemen hereabouts  are Graziers tho' all the Graziers are not Gentlemen they shewed me one remarkable inclosed Field of Pastureground which was lett for  l per Ann  to a Grazier and I knew the Tenant very well whose Name was  Houghton  who confirmed the Truth of it  The late Duke of  Wharton  had a very fine Seat at  Winchenden  and another much finer nearer  Windsor  called  Ubourn  But the Catastrophe that has befallen this once flourishing and truly noble Family is too melancholy and too well known to be animadverted upon here  Near this Place lies  Chilton  famous for giving Birth to that steddy Patriot the Lord Chief Justice  Crook  who strenuously opposed the arbitrary Measures of levying Shipmoney without the Authority of Parliament  Southwest of  Aylesbury  lies the Markettown of  Tame  situated on the Side of a Meadow and almost incompassed with Rivulets It consists of one long broad Street The Church is large and fine in Form of a Cross near which are the Ruins of a Priory A Pot of  Roman  Coin was found here about Years since  The  Thame  joins the other Branch named also the  Thames  at  Dorchester  in  Oxfordshire  In this Vale of  Aylesbury  flourished the great and antient Family of  Hampden  for many Ages in the Enjoyment of very large Estates which like that of  Wharton  are now dissipated  At the Confluence of the  Thame  and  Isis  stands  Dorchester  a Town of Note among the antient  Romans  and in the Year was made a Bishop's See till  Remigius  in removed it to  Lincoln  It has a very large Church and a fine large Stone Bridge of great Length and Antiquity  East of  Aylesbury  lies  Ivingo  a pleasant Markettown situate among Woods in a Nook or kind of  Peninsula which runs in between  Bedfordshire  and  Hertfordshire    We passed forward Northwest thro'  Win  low  a small Markettown to  Buckingham  the CountyTown situated in a low fruitful Ground surrounded by the  Ouze  on all Sides but the North 'Tis govern'd by a Bailiff and Capital Burgesses The Castle is now old and ruinous and the Buildings of the Town are also old It has Three Stone Bridges over the River and a wellbuilt Church and a Chapel built by Archbishop  Becket  which is now used for a Freeschool Several Papermills are erected on the  Ouze  and the Town is divided into two Parts one where the Church stands and the other where the Townhall is The County Gaol and Court are kept here and sometimes the Assizes  Going still farther Northward we come to the following Towns  Stony Stratford  is remarkable for standing on the  Roman  Causeway called  Watlingstreet  It is an antient and wellknown Thoroughfare Town in the  Chester  Road from  London  It is large and wellbuilt of Stone has Two Churches in it and a Cross erected by  Edward  I to the Honour of his Queen  Eleanor  and has a good Stone Bridge over the River The principal Manufacture as well in the Neighbourhood as in the Town is Bonelace  Newportpagnell  is a large wellbuilt populous Town seated on the River  Ouze  over which it has Two large Stone Bridges It carries on a great Trade in Bonelace and the same Manufacture imploys also the neighbouring Villages  Oulney  is a pretty good Town where also is carried on a considerable Manufacture of Bonelace It lies on the Extremity of the County  We then fell down back again to  Buckingham  and following the great Road Northwest we came to  Brackley  in  Northamptonshire  situate on the River  Ouze  an antient large corporate Town in which are Two Parish Churches It had formerly a College but it is now used for a Freeschool It is governed by a Mayor and Aldermen and the Market used to be the Staple for Wool in that County but it is now removed  We next came to  Banbury  in  Oxfordshire  on the River  Charwell  It is a large Markettown under the Government of a Mayor and Aldermen It has a considerable Trade especially in Cheese as all the Country round it is a rich feeding Meadowground Here the famous  Makeking  Earl of  Warwick  surprised the Earl of  Pembroke  and his Brother of the Party of  Edward  IV and beheaded them  On the Borders of this County Westward from this Town in  Warwickshire  was the famous Battle of  Edgehill  fought between the Forces of King  Charles  I and those of the Parliament where tho' the Victory was dubious yet the Advantage in the Event inclined to the King's Side for he thereupon took Lord  Say  's House at  Broughton  and  Banbury  Castle in which were Foot and a Troop of Horse  Edgehill  lies at the West End of the Vale of  Redhorse  and gives a most extensive Prospect It is steep to the North and on the Top of it at  Warmlington  is a strong large Entrenchment said to be  Danish  but looks more like  British  On the Descent of the Hill between  Radway  and  Keynton  was fought the aforementioned Battle here also they shew where the Slain were bury'd and have a Tradition that King  John  had a Palace and resided at  Keyntor    There was likewise at  Cropredy  Bridge an Encounter between the  Royalists  and the  Parliamentarians  under  Waller  's Command  West of  Edgehill  stands  Shipton  a little Town which has a very large Market  Banbury  gave Title of Earl to the noble Family of  Knolles  which it seems became extinct in when the last Earl died but his Wife marrying  Nicolas  Lord  Vaux  had a Son by him who took the Name of  Knolles  and the Title of Earl but was never summoned to Parliament nor his Son after him who is now living and commonly called Lord  Banbury    From hence we rode Southward to  Deddington  a large Town but a very small Market It is govern'd by a Bailiff and did formerly return Members to Parliament  We turned a little East and came to  Bicester  a straggling indifferent Town but remarkable for having had once a famous City in its Neighbourhood called  Aldchester  long since passed over by the Plough and where many  Roman  Coins Stones and other Antiquities are found which was undoubtedly the  Maima  of  Ravennas Bicester  is famous for excellent Malt Liquor and has had formerly a Religious House  Islip  lying directly in our Way to  Oxford  we passed thro' it It is remarkable for the Birth of  Edward the Confessor  and that Dr  South  as well as other eminent Divines were Ministers here There are some Remains of an antient Palace still left  From hence I came to  Oxford  famous for several Things but chiefly for its being the most flourishing and considerable University in the World  There has been a long Contest between the Two  English  Universities about the Priority of their Foundations which perhaps will never be decided and so I pass it over  It is out of Question that in the Largeness of the Place the Beauty of Situation the Number of Inhabitants and of Scholars  Oxford  has the Advantage In short  Oxford  has several Things as an  University which  Cambridge  has not and  Cambridge  has several Things in it which cannot be found in  Oxford  For Example  The Theatre the Museum or Chamber of Rarities the  Bodleian  Library the Number of Colleges and the Magnificence of their Buildings are on the Side of  Oxford  yet  King's  College Chapel and College is in favour of  Cambridge  being one of the finest Structures of its kind that can be seen and the new Buildings erected lately there make that whole University still more considerable in this way  Oxford  is a noble flourishing City so possessed of all that can contribute to make the Residence of the Scholars easy and comfortable that no Spot of Ground in  England  goes beyond it It is situated in a delightful Plain on the Bank of a fine navigable River in a plentiful Country and at an easy Distance from  London    The City itself is large populous and rich and as it is adorn'd by the most beautiful Buildings of Colleges and Halls it makes the most noble Figure of any City of its Bigness in  Europe    We shall present our Readers with a List of the Colleges and Halls in this famous City with a brief History of them but must observe that as it would exceed our Limits to give an Account of the particular Benefactions by which their Revenues and Buildings are so splendidly augmented we shall only mention such of those Benefactions as have been conferred within so few Years back that they are not likely to be found in other Authors  Of the  COLLEGES  and  HALLS  in  OXFORD    UNIVERSITY COLLEGE  IS situate near the East Gate of the City 'Tis so very antient that we are left in the dark as to the Time of its Foundation That it was in being before  the Year is certain but how much sooner is not evident King  Alfred  could not be so properly called the Founder of this University as the Restorer after the  Danish  Devastations In the Year this College was recover'd into a State of Liberty and Independency by a Sum of Money which  William  of  Durham  had left for the Maintenance of a Society of Students in  Oxford  from whom it was some time call'd  Durhamhall  and by other Benefactions it increased to what it now is It has One Master Twelve Fellows Ten Scholars Two Exhibitioners  c  Before the very noble Benefaction of Dr  Radcliffe  it had one large beautiful Quadrangle or square Court the South

George Clarke  's Will in its Favour of which we shall give an Abstract byandby a Provost Six Fellows Six Scholars  c  The Buildings lately added now adding and the fine Additions left to it by the

in the University  HERTFORD COLLEGE  This is a College of a very late Erection indeed for it was but in  Sept  that his Majesty's Royal Charter passed the Broad Seal to erect HARTHALL as it was before called into a College to consist of a Principal as before Four Seniors and Eight Junior Fellows so that at last the Reverend Dr  Richard Newton  the worthy Principal after an Opposition of several Years given by some who ought to have assisted his generous View has obtained a Point which lay very near his Heart tho' not till several of his worthy Friends who would have contributed largely to its Endowment had it been effected in their Time are demised  which must necessarily be a great Disadvantage to the good Design  This College as it now must be called stands in the Parish of  St Peter  's in the East It is supposed to have its Name from the first Syllable of  Elias Hartford  's Surname who was once Owner of it  Walter Stapledon  Bishop of  Exeter  having bought it converted it  Anno  into an Academical Seminary by the Name of  Stapledonhall  and endowed it with Maintenance for Twelve Scholars which he removed afterwards to  Exeter  College on building the same and then this Hall resumed its own Name It has a Stipend or Exhibition belonging to it of more than  l per Annum    It consists of one Quadrangle not very regular and the present worthy Principal has made several and had projected still greater Additions to it which would have taken place long ago but for the Reasons above given  These are the Twenty Colleges of which at present this famous University consists There are besides Five Halls which are Places unendow'd tho' not destitute of Exhibitions The Students at these subsist at their own Charge are under the Government of a Principal and VicePrincipal and pay the former for their Lodging  c  The Principals are nominated by the Chancellor except the Principal of  Edmundhall  Their Visitor is the Chancellor  I will give a brief Account of each of these And  ALBAN HALL  It is situate on the South Side of the Town and had its Name from  Robert St Alban  once Proprietor of the Place It became Academical about the Year  The Front makes but a tolerable Appearance but the Inside falls short even of that  EDMUND HALL  Is situate in the Parish of  St Peter  's in the East and has its Name probably from one  Edmund  a Citizen of  Oxford  Proprietor of the Place  Anno  it was purchased by  Queen's  College and converted to its present Use  It makes one Quadrangle on the East Side of which stands a very neat Chapel and Library built some Years since by the Reverend Mr  Stephen Penton  its Principal  ST MARY HALL  Situate in the Parish of  St Mary  has its Name either from that Church which with this Hall came to belong to  Oriel  College by a Grant of King  Edward  II  Anno  or from  Oriel  College heretofore called  St Mary Hall    It consists of one Quadrangle not very regular Dr  John Hudson  Principal built here handsome Lodgings at his own Expence  NEWINN HALL  Is situate in the Northwest Part of the Town It was called  Trilleckhall  from Two Brothers Proprietors of it of that Name one Bishop of  Hereford  and the other Bishop of  Rochester  Afterwards the Founder of  New College  bought it and gave it to that College  Anno  and from that time it was called  NewInn Hall    The Building is antient and irregular  ST MARY MAGDALEN HALL  Situate near  Magdalen  College was built by  William Wainfleet  Bishop of  Winchester Anno  for a Grammarschool But it having Room for Academical Students and some Additions having been made to it it became an Academical Society It enjoys Fifteen Exhibitions Five of  l per Annum  and Ten of  l  The Front is the most considerable Part of it but it has a pretty good Library  What Additions have been made to some of the Colleges by means of the Wills of Dr  Ratcliffe  and Dr  Clarke  which I have just referred to will to avoid Repetition where I am so pressed for Room be best seen in Abstracts of the said Wills which may serve as a Supplement to the foregoing Accounts of the Colleges Dr  Ratcliff  's is to the following Effect  He left an Establishment of  l per Ann  for Two young Physicians to travel to be enjoyed by them for Ten Years after which or in case of Death others were to succeed them for ever  The Remainder of the Estate charged to secure this annual Sum he left to  University  College  Oxon  for purchasing perpetual Advowsons for the Members of the same  To  St Bartholomew  's Hospital  London  he left  l per Ann  for ever towards mending their Diet as his Will expresses it and  l per Ann  more for ever for buying of Linen  Five hundred Pounds to build the Front of  University  College answerable to what was before built and for building the Master's Lodgings therein and Chambers for his Two travelling Fellows  Forty thousand Pounds for building a Library in  Oxon  and purchasing the Houses between  St Mary  's and the Schools in  Catstreet  for that Purpose and when built he bequeathed  l per Annum  to the Librarykeeper and  l  a Year for ever to buy Books for the same  He charg'd all his real and personal Estate with the Payment of these great Benefactions and other large Family Bequests and willed that the Residue should be applied to such charitable Purposes as his Executors should think best  He willed that  l  a Year for ever should be applied to keep in Repair the said Library to  commence Payment in Thirty Years after his Death  All the Livings in his Gift he willed should be bestowed on Members of  University  College and if wanting there to Fellows of  Lincoln  College  To his Executors who were  William Bromley    Esq  Sir  George Beaumont  Bart  Thomas Sclater    Esq  and  Anthony Keck    Esq  all since deceased he left  l  each and a Power of nominating Two Successors to each of them as they respectively died  His Will bears Date  Sept  the th and the Doctor died  Nov  the same Year  We shall now add That every thing being done in pursuance of this Will which the Time since his Death would permit it may be easily conceived what a glorious Addition the Buildings finished and finishing by its Direction must be to this renowned University  George Clarke  LL D was several Years Representative in Parliament for the University of  Oxford  and died  October  Of whose Will take the following Abstract  He bequeathed to the Librarykeeper of  Worcester  College  l per Ann  and to a young Gownsman to attend to reach down Books  l  Four thousand Pounds for Building Nine Chambers at  Worcester  College and finishing the Chapel and Hall there Six of these Chambers to be for Six additional Fellows of that College who are to have  l  each  per Ann  the other Three to be for so many additional Scholars at  l per Ann  each  Fifty Pounds  per Ann  to be laid out in Books for the said College Library  He orders his Trustees as soon as they can to purchase the Ground adjoining to

Halflengths of Lord Chancellor  Clarendon  and his Son the Earl of  Rochester  to be hung in the Delegates Room at the  Clarendon Printinghouse  and an Original the only one of Dr  John Radcliffe  to

 College Library all his printed Books and Prints and such Manuscripts as his Trustees shall think fit also to the same all the Designs of  Inigo Jones  for  Whitehall  which he takes notice are very valuable  To the same College he gives a large twoear'd Silver Cup doublegilt weighing Ounces  To the Warden and College of  AllSouls  whereof he was Fellow all the Furniture in his Collegechamber and all that in the Lodgings he had built there with his Prints therein and Pictures over the Doors and Chimneypieces the Ceilingpiece over the Staircase  Hercules  in the Garden and St  Luke  in two Columns to be used in the Place they now are by the said Warden and his Successors  To the Use of the Fellows of the said College the Rooms under the great Diningroom the great Diningroom itself and the great Bedchamber and Garrets over them  To  AllSouls  College he bequeaths also his th Turn of presenting to the Vicarage of  Yarnton  for the Benefit of such of its Chaplains as have  but a slender Provision and  l  among the Collegeservants  An Augmentation as it shall rise out of one of his Estates to the Allowance of the Two Chaplains of  AllSouls  whom he hopes the Society will appoint their Librarians  To  Queen  's College he gives the Heads of Six Queens of  England    You will refer Sir to the Accounts I have already given of the Colleges and to the above Abstracts of Dr  Radcliff  's and Dr  Clarke  's Wills and you will have a View of the State of these Colleges even when the Works are finished as directed by those Gentlemen and which will hold for Years to come without material Alteration except in case of new Benefactions  I shall now give a Summary of what a Traveller may observe further in  Oxford en passant  and refer the more curious Inquirer to the Histories of the Place for a more ample and particular Account than I have room to give  Besides these Colleges and Halls there are some publick Buildings which make a most glorious Appearance The first and greatest of all is the  Theatre  a Building not to be equall'd by any thing of its Kind and Bigness in the World Sir  Christopher Wren  was the Director of the Work Archbishop  Sheldon  paid for it and gave it to the University there is a world of Decoration in the Front of it and more beautiful Additions by way of Ornament and the inside Roof finely painted and decorated is never enough to be admired  The  Bodleian  Library is an Ornament in itself worthy of this famous University I have not Room for its History at large but shall briefly observe that the first publick Library in  Oxford  was erected in  Durham  College now  Trinity  by  Richard  Bishop of  Durham  Lord Treasurer to  Edward  III it was afterward joined to another founded by  Cobham  Bishop of  Winchester  and both inlarged by the Bounty of  Humphry  Duke of  Gloucester  Founder of the Divinity Schools But these Libraries being lost and the Books embezzled and the Place where they were deposited quite ruinous Sir  Thomas Bodley  a wealthy and learned Knight having at a vast Expence collected Books and Manuscripts from all Parts of the World placed them in the old Libraryroom built by the good Duke  Humphry    This great Work was brought to an Head the th of  Nov  and has continued increasing by the Benefactions of great and learned Men to this Day such as Archbishop  Laud  the Earl of  Pembroke Oliver Cromwell Selden Digby  and other great Names  Over it is a spacious Gallery adorned with Pictures of Founders Benefactors  c  and with the antique Marbles which were the learned Part of the inexhaustible Collection of the Earl of  Arundel  which have been illustrated with the accurate Comments of  Selden  and  Prideaux  Here are some of the most valuable  Greek  Monuments now in the World Over the Porch upon an handsome Pedestal of black Marble stands the Brass Effigies of the Earl of  Pembroke  their noble and generous Chancellor given by the late Earl moulded by  Rubens  Also a very large Collection of  Greek Roman British Saxon English  and other Coins presented by Sir  T Roe  and other Hands And that indefatigable and learned Collector of Books and valuable Manuscripts Dr  Tanner  Bishop of St  Asaph  who died  December  bequeathed the most curious Part of his fine Collection to this noble Library  In the Year by the Death of Mrs  Crew  Relict of  George Crew    Esq  an Estate of  l per Annum  is fallen to the Head Librarian's Post which  before was very inconsiderable tho' it required a constant Residence This was a Legacy of the late Right Reverend and Right Honourable  Nathanael Crew  Lord Bishop of  Durham  who was such a good Benefactor to  Lincoln  College as we have mentioned  Other curious Things in  Oxford  are the Schools which are now beautifully repaired and the Names and Arms of old Benefactors renewed and repainted the Museum the Chamber of Rarities the Collection of Coins Medals Pictures and antient Inscriptions the Printinghouse the Physickgarden the University and other Churches the Convocationhouse  c  all worthy of a particular Description had I room to give it  The University is govern'd by a Chancellor chosen by Scrutiny or Collection of Votes he is generally one of the first Noblemen of the Kingdom  By a Highsteward chosen by the Chancellor  By a Vicechancellor who must be one of the Heads of a College recommended to the University by the Chancellor  By Two Proctors chosen annually by Turn out of the Colleges  The other Officers are the publick Orator and the Keeper of the Archives Beadles Virger  c  But tho' I have said so much of the University I must not quite forget the City Let me then observe That before  Baliol  College they shew the Stone in the Street which marks the Place of the Martyrdom of Archbishop  Cranmer  and Bishop  Ridley  then upon the Banks of the Ditch without the City Walls which went along where the Theatre now stands  Beyond the River stood  Oseny  Abbey founded Upon the Bridge is a Tower call  d  Frier  Bacon  's Study  from that famous and learned Monk  Over another Bridge on the  Isis  we went to see  Ruleigh  Abbey where some Ruins still remain turn'd to a common Brewhouse  Of the Castle remains a square high Tower by the Riverside and a lofty Mount or Keep walled at Top with a Staircase going downward  The  Whitefriers  was a Royal Palace and near a Green called  Beaumonds  they shew'd us the Bottom of a Tower upon the Spot where the valiant  Richard  I was born  Without the Town on all Hands are to be seen the Fortifications erected in the late Civil Wars  As to the City tho' the Colleges make up Twothirds of it and are still elbowing for more Room yet 'tis large and regular the Streets are spacious clean and strait the Place pleasant and healthful the Inhabitants genteel and courteous the Churches many and elegant especially  Allhallows  and taking it altogether and including the Grandeur and Endowment of the Colleges their Chapels Halls Libraries Quadrangles Piazza's Gardens Walks Groves  c  it must be consider'd as the first University in the World as I have before mention'd  On the Lefthand on the other Side the River the last Remains of  Godstow  Nunnery are situated among the sweet Meadows Here fair  Rosamond  had a remarkably fine Tomb but before the Dissolution scarce could her Ashes rest  whose Beauty was thought guilty  as one says  even after Death    I cannot leave  Oxford  without making one Observation with regard to those who insist that it was to the Piety of the Popish Times which we owe the first Institution of the University itself the Foundation and Endowment of the particular Colleges and the Encouragement arising to Learning from thence all which I readily grant but would have them remember too that tho' those Foundations stood as they tell us Years and that the Reformation  as they say is not above Years standing yet Learning has more increased and the Universities flourish'd more more great Scholars been produced greater Libraries been raised and more fine Buildings been erected in these Years than in the Years of Popery and I might add as many great Benefactions have been given notwithstanding this very momentous Difference that the Protestants Gifts are merely Acts of Charity to the World and Acts of Bounty in Reverence to Learning and learned Men without the grand Incitement of the State of their own Souls and those of their Fathers which were to be pray'd out of Purgatory and get a ready Admission into Heaven  Oxford  was for many Years advantaged by the Neighbourhood of the Royal Court while several Kings of  England  being taken with the fine Situation of  Woodstock  made their Palace there the Place of their Summer Retreat  Dr  Plott  allows it to have been a Royal House ever since King  Alfred  and a Manuscript in the  Cotton  Library confirms it and that King  Henry  I was not the Founder of it but only rebuilt it And as for  Henry  II who kept his fair  Rosamond  in it he made only some Additions to it for the Entertainment and Security of his beautiful Mistress Notwithstanding which the Queen having got Access to her in the King's Absence as Tradition informs us dispatch'd her by Poison  When I was first at  Woodstock  some Years ago I saw part of the old Palace and the famous Labyrinth of fair  Rosamond  but now these are destroy'd Her  Bathingplace  or  Well  as it is called is left a quadrangular Receptacle of pure Water immediately flowing from a little Spring under the Hill overshadow'd with Trees near which are some Ruins of Walls and Arches King  Ethelred  called a Parliament here It has been a Royal Seat as I have said  from most antient Times  Henry  I inclosed the Park Across this Valley was a remarkably fine Echo that would repeat a whole Hexameter but impair'd by the Removal of these Buildings A stately Bridge or Rialto rather now leads along the grand Approach to the present Castle one Arch is above Feet Diameter a Cascade of Water falls from a Lake down some stone Steps into the Canal that runs under it  The new Palace of  Blenheim  is a vast and magnificent Pile of Building a Royal Gift to the high Merit of the invincible Duke of  Marlborough  The lofty Hall is painted by Sir  James Thornhill  the Ceiling by  la Guerre  The Rooms are finely inrich'd with Marble Chimneypieces and Furniture but more by the incomparable Paintings and Hangings which latter represent the principal Glories of the Duke's Life Among the Pictures are many of  Rubens  's best and largest Pieces that celebrated one of himself his Wife and Child among others  Vandyke  's King  Charles  I upon a Dun Horse of great Value and the famous Loves of the Gods by  Titian  a Present from the King of  Sardinia  The Gallery is worthy Admiration lined with Marble Pilasters and whole Pillars of one Piece supporting a most costly and curious Entablature excellent for Matter and Workmanship the Windowframes of the same and a Basement of black Marble quite round Before it is stretched out a most agreeable Prospect of the fine Woods beyond the great Valleys What is of the most elegant Taste in the whole House is of the Duchess's own Designing The Chapel is equal to the rest The Garden is a very large Plot of Ground taken out of the Park and may still be said to be a Part of it wellcontriv'd by sinking the outer Wall into a Foss to give a View quite round and take off the odious Appearance of Confinement and Limitation to the Eye It is within  well adorn'd with Walks Greens Espaliers and Vista's to divers remarkable Objects that offer themselves in the circumjacent Country Over the Pediment of this Front of the House is a curious Marble Busto of  Lewis  XIV bigger than the Life taken from the Gate of the Citadel of  Tournay  The Orangery is a pretty Room Near the Gate of the Palace is the House where our famous  Chaucer  was born At the Entrance into the Castle from the Town her Grace has erected a noble triumphal Arch to the Memory of the Duke and has set up a vast Obelisk in the principal Avenue of the Park whereon is inscribed the best Account of the Duke's Actions and Character that ever was penn'd in the same Compass and if done by the masterly Hand of that extraordinary Genius to whom I have heard it attributed must be a double Triumph to the Memory of the Duke since his Merits extorted so noble a Testimony from a Person who was once engaged in Measures quite opposite to those which derived upon his Grace so exalted a Reputation and who was thought to be at that Time one of his principal Adversaries  The Inscription does so much Honour to the Memory of the Duke and at the same time to the  British  Nation that I cannot deny to myself the Pleasure of inserting it here as follows  The Castle of  Blenheim  was founded by Queen  ANNE    In the Fourth Year of her Reign  In the Year of the Christian Aera  A Monument design'd to perpetuate the Memory of the  Signal Victory  Obtained over the  French  and  Bavarians    Near the Village of  Blenheim    On the Banks of the  Danube    By JOHN Duke of MARLBOROUGH  The Hero not only of this Nation but of this Age  Whose Glory was equal in the Council and in the Field  Who by Wisdom Justice Candour and Address  Reconciled various and even opposite Interests  Acquired an Influence  Which no Rank no Authority can give  Nor any Force but that of superior Virtue  Became the fixed important Centre  Which united in one common Cause  The principal States of  Europe    Who by military Knowlege and irresistible Valour  In a long Series of uninterrupted Triumphs  Broke the Power of  France    When raised the highest when exerted the most  Rescued the Empire from Desolation  Asserted and confirmed the Liberties of  Europe    Philip  a Grandson of the House of  France  united to the Interests directed by the Policy supported by the Arms of that Crown was placed on the Throne of  Spain  King WILLIAM III beheld this formidable Union of Two great and once rival Monarchies At the End of a Life spent in defending the Liberties of  Europe  he saw them in their greatest Danger He provided for their Security in the most effectual Manner He took the Duke of MARLBOROUGH into his Service  Embassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary  To the  States General  of the  United Provinces    The Duke contracted several Alliance before the Death of King WILLIAM He confirmed and improved these He contracted others after the Accession of Queen ANNE and reunited the Confederacy which had been dissolved at the End of a former War in a stricter and firmer League  CaptainGeneral and Commander in Chief  Of the Forces of GREAT BRITAIN  The Duke led to the Field the Army of the Allies He took with surprising Rapidity  Venlo Ruremonde Stevenswaert  and  Liege  He extended and secured the Frontiers  of the  Dutch  The Enemies whom he found insulting at the Gates of  Nimeghen  were driven to seek for Shelter behind their Lines He forced  Bonne Huy Limburgh  in another Campaign He opened the Communication of the  Rhine  as well as the  Maes  He added all the Country between these Rivers to his former Conquests The Army of  France  favoured by the Defection of the Elector of  Bavaria  had penetrated into the Heart of the  Empire  This mighty Body lay exposed to immediate Ruin In that memorable Crisis the Duke of MARLBOROUGH led his Troops with unexampled Celerity Secrecy Order from the  Ocean  to the  Danube  He saw He attacked Nor stopped but to conquer the Enemy He forced the  Bavarians  sustained by the  French  in their strong Intrenchments at  Schellenberg  He passed the  Danube  A second Royal Army composed of the best Troops of  France  was sent to reinforce the first That of the Confederates was divided With one Part of it the Siege of  Ingolstadt  was carried on With the other the Duke gave Battle to the united Strength of  France  and  Bavaria  On the d Day of  August  he gained a more glorious Victory than the Histories of any Age can boast The Heaps of Slain were dreadful Proofs of his Valour A Marshal of  France  whole Legions of  French  his Prisoners proclaimed his Mercy  Bavaria  was subdued  Ratisbon Augsbourg Ulm Meminghen  all the Usurpations of the Enemy were recovered The Liberty of the  Diet  the Peace of the  Empire  were restored From the  Danube  the Duke turned his victorious Arms towards the  Rhine  and the  Moselle Landau Treves Traerbach  were taken In the Course of one Campaign the very Nature of the War was changed The Invaders of other States were reduced to defend their own The Frontier of  France  was exposed in its weakest Part to the Efforts of the Allies  That he might improve this Advantage that he might push the Sum of Things to a speedy Decision the Duke of MARLBOROUGH led his Troops early in the following Year once more to the  Moselle  They whom he had saved a few Months before neglected to second  him now They who might have been his Companions in Conquest refused to join him When he saw the generous Designs he had formed frustrated by private Interest by Pique by Jealousy he returned with Speed to the  Maes  He returned and Fortune and Victory returned with him  Liege  was relieved  Huy  retaken The  French  who had pressed the Army of the  StatesGeneral  with superior Numbers retired behind Intrenchments which they deemed impregnable The Duke forced these Intrenchments with inconsiderable Loss on the th Day of  July  He defeated a great Part of the Army which defended them The rest escaped by a precipitate Retreat If Advantages proportionable to this Success were not immediately obtained let the Failure be ascribed to that Misfortune which attends most Confederacies a Division of Opinions where one alone should judge a Division of Power where one alone should command The Disappointment itself did Honour to the Duke It became the Wonder of Mankind how he could do so much under those Restraints which had hindred him from doing more  Powers more absolute were given him afterwards The Increase of his Powers multiplied his Victories At the opening of the next Campaign when all his Army was not yet assembled when it was hardly known that he had taken the Field the Noise of his Triumphs was heard over  Europe  On the th of  May  he attacked the  French  at  Ramillies  In the Space of Two Hours the whole Army was put to Flight The Vigour and Conduct with which he improved this Success were equal to those wherewith he gained it  Louvain Brussels Malines Liere Ghent Oudenard Antwerp Damme Bruges Courtray  surrendered  Ostend Menin Dendermond  and  Aeth  were taken  Brabant  and  Flanders  were recovered Places which had resisted the greatest Generals for Months for Years Provinces disputed for Ages were the Conquests of a Summer Nor was the Duke content to triumph alone Solicitous for the general Interest his Care  extended to the remotest Scenes of the War He chose to lessen his own Army that he might enable the Leaders of other Armies to conquer To this it must be ascribed that  Turin  was relieved the Duke of  Savoy  reinstated the  French  driven with Confusion out of  Italy    These Victories gave the Confederates an Opportunity of carrying on the War on every Side into the Dominions of  France  But she continu'd to enjoy a kind of peaceful Neutrality in  Germany  From  Italy  she was once alarm'd and had no more to fear The intire Reduction of his Power whose Ambition had caused whose Strength supported the War seemed reserved for him alone who had so triumphantly begun the glorious Work  The Barrier of  France  on the Side of the  LowCountries  had been forming for more than half a Century What Art Power Expence could do had been done to render it impenetrable Yet here she was most exposed for here the Duke of MARLBOROUGH threatened to attack her  To cover what they had gained by Surprize or had been yielded to them by Treachery the  French  marched to the Banks of the  Schelde  At their Head were the Princes of the Blood and their most fortunate General the Duke of  Vendosme  Thus commanded thus posted they hoped to check the Victor in his Course Vain were their Hopes The Duke of MARLBOROUGH passed the River in their Sight He defeated their whole Army The Approach of Night concealed the Proximity of  Ghent  favoured their Flight They neglected nothing to repair their Loss to defend their Frontier New Generals new Armies appeared in the  Netherlands  All contributed to inhance the Glory none were able to retard the Progress of the confederate Army  Lisle  the Bulwark of this Barrier was besieged A numerous Garison and a Marshal of  France  defended the Place Prince EUGENE of  Savoy  commanded the Duke of MARLBOROUGH covered and sustained the Siege The Rivers were seized and the Communication with  Holland  interrupted The Duke opened new Communications with great Labour and much greater Art Through Countries overrun by the Enemy the necessary Convoys arriv'd in Safety One alone was attacked The Troops which attacked it were beat The Defence of  Lisle  was animated by Assurances of Relief  The  French  assembled all their Force They marched towards the Town The Duke of MARLBOROUGH offered them Battle without suspending the Siege They abandoned the Enterprize They came to save the Town They were Spectators of its Fall  From this Conquest the Duke hastened to others The Posts taken by the Enemy on the  Schelde  were surprised That River was passed the second time and notwithstanding the great Preparations made to prevent it without Opposition  Brussels  besieged by the Elector of  Bavaria  was relieved  Ghent  surrendered to the Duke in the Middle of a Winter remarkably severe An Army little inferior to his own marched out of the Place  As soon as the Season of the Year permitted him to open another Campaign the Duke besieged and took  Tournay  He invested  Mons  Near this City the  French  Army covered by thick Woods defended by noble Intrenchments waited to molest nor presumed to offer Battle Even this was not attempted by them with Impunity On the last Day of  August  the Duke attacked them in their Camp All was employed nothing availed against the Resolution of such a General against the Fury of such Troops The Battle was bloody The Event decisive The Woods were pierced The Fortifications trampled down The Enemy fled The Town was taken  Doway Bethune Aire St Venant Bouchain  underwent the same Fate in Two succeeding Years Their vigorous Resistance could not save them The Army of  France  durst not attempt to relieve them It seemed preserved to defend the Capital of the Monarchy  The Prospect of this extreme Distress was neither distant nor dubious The  French  acknowleged their Conqueror and sued for Peace  These are the Actions of the late Duke of MARLBOROUGH  Performed in the Compass of a few Years  Sufficient to adorn the Annals of Ages  The Admiration of other Nations  Will be conveyed to latest Posterity  In the Histories even of the Enemies of BRITAIN  The Sense which the  British  Nation had  Of his transcendent Merit  Was expressed  In the most solemn most effectual most durable manner  The Acts of Parliament  Several Recitals of Clauses in Acts of Parliament made to do Honour to this immortal Commander are engraven on the same superb Pillar  inscribed on this Pillar  Shall stand  As long as the  British  Name and Language last  Illustrious Monuments  Of MARLBOROUGH's Glory  And  Of BRITAIN's Gratitude  At  Woodstock  they make the fine Steel Chains for Watches and other Things of polish'd Steel  From  Woodstock  I went Northwest to  ChippingNorton  which must have been once a Town of great Trade by the Number of Merchants as they are called on the Brasses over their Monuments and besides the Name  Chipping  denotes as much There are Marks of a Castle by the Church and  Roman  Coins are frequently found here The Church is a good Building and after a curious Model  Hence we rode to see  Rowldrich  Stones a little  Stonehenge  being a Circle of great Stones standing upright some of them from Five to Seven Feet high and probably the  Vestigia  of an old  British  Temple as that was and Mr  Toland  positively asserts that they were so  At  Tidmerton  Parish is a large Camp of an orbicular Form on the Summit of an Hill which is doubly intrenched and able to contain a great Army  When I was at  Banbury  I should have mentioned  Bloxham  which lies North of it where is a fine Church the Steeple of an odd but agreeable Make  Near  Bloxham  is also the famous Parish of  Brightwell  of which it was observed that there had not been an Alehouse nor a Dissenter from the Church nor any Quarrel among the Inhabitants that rose so high as to a Suit of Law within the Memory of Man But they could not say it was so still especially as to the Alehouse Part tho' very much is still preserved as to the Unity and good Neighbourhood of the Parishioners and their Conformity to the Church  Being now on the Side of  Warwickshire  as is said before I still went South and passing by the  Four Shire Stones  we saw where the Counties of  Oxford Warwick  and  Gloucester  join all in a Point one Stone standing in each County and the fourth touching all Three  Entering  Gloucestershire  here Westward we came after a Mile's Ride to  Moretonhenmarsh  a small Town which had formerly a Market but now discontinued it lies on the great Road to  Worcester  And the famous  Roman  Fosseway which coming out of  Warwickshire  enters this County at  Lemington  which lies Northeast of this Town strikes thro' it and also thro'  Stow  and  NorthLeach  down to  Cirencester  Southward  Hence we come to the famous  Cotswolddowns  so eminent for the best of Sheep and finest Wool in  England  Fame tells us that some of these Sheep were sent by King  Richard  I into  Spain  and that from hence the Breed of their Sheep was raised which now produce so fine a Wool that we are obliged to fetch it from thence at a great Price for making our finest Broad Cloaths  Upon these Downs we had a clear View of the aforementioned famous  Fosse  which evidently crosses all the Middle Part of  England  and is to be seen and known tho' in no Place plainer than here quite from the  Bath  to  Warwick  and thence to  Leicester  to  Newark  to  Lincoln  and on to  Barton  upon the Bank of  Humber    We observed also how several cross Roads as antient as the  Fosse  join'd it or branched out of it some of which the People have by antient Usage tho' corruptly called also  Fosses  For Example  The  Ackmanstreet  which is an antient  Saxon  Road leading from  Buckinghamshire  thro'  Oxfordshire  to the  Fosse  and so to the  Bath  this joins the  Fosse  between  Burford  and  Cirencester  Also  Grimesdyke  from  Oxfordshire Wattlebank  or  Avesditch  from the same and the  Wouldway  call'd also the  Fosse  crossing from  Gloucester  to  Cirencester    Many Seats of the Nobility are to be found in these Parts  Cornbury  Lord  Clarendon  's  Ditchley  Lord  Litchfield  's  Hathorp  the late Duke of  Shrewsbury  's new built of Stone very beautifully  The  Lech  the  Coln  the  Churn  and the  Isis  all rise in the  Cotswould  Hills and joining together make a full Stream at  Lechlade  near this Place and become one River there and are called the  Thames  which begins there to be navigable and Barges may be seen at the Quay taking in Goods for  London  which makes  Lechlade  very populous Of which Town more byandby  Stow on the Would  which is the next Town we came to is but indifferent to look at but is or rather has been remarkable for its Two annual Fairs famous for Hops Cheese and Sheep of which 'tis said that above are generally sold at one Fair and that the Toll of these Fairs and the Markets amount to  l  a Year The Parish is very large being Miles in Compass and consists of Meadow  Arable and Pasture Here is a good large Rectory Church standing on a Hill with a high Tower on the Southside of it which is seen a great Distance off Here is also an Hospital Almshouse and Freeschool all well endow'd besides other Charities  Northleche  is also a Markettown governed by a Bailiff and Two Constables and is named from the River  Leche  which runs through it Here is a Vicarage Church large and spacious having Ayles on each Side and handsome Windows with a large Tower Here is a Grammarschool free for all the Boys of the Town endow'd with  l  a Year And 'tis said that the Founder falling afterwards into Misfortunes solicited for the Master's Place of his own School but could not obtain it from the Trustees  Here we quitted the  Roman Fosse  and went Eastward to  Burford  in  Oxfordshire  King  Henry  II gave this Town a Charter  Guildam omnes consuetudines quas habent liberi Burgenses de Oxenford  but they are almost all now lost however it retains some Marks of a Corporation still being governed by Two Bailiffs and other inferior Officers It is famous for Saddles and lying near the Downs draws great Profit from the Horseraces which are frequent here At this Place was convened a Synod in against the Error of the  British  Churches in the Observance of  Easter    At  Battleedge  near this Town  Cuthred  King of the  West Saxons  beat  Ethelbald  King of the  Mercians  in a pitch'd Battle and threw off his Yoke The Inhabitants celebrate yearly on  Midsummereve  a kind of Festival which they say commenced in Honour of this Battle It was here the learned Dr  Heylin  descended originally from an antient Family in  Wales  was born and the famous Speaker  Lenthal  had a Seat and died here  Being so near  Witney  we could not forbear taking a Ride to see a Town so famous for the Manufactures of Blanketing and Rugs which thrive here in a most extraordinary manner Here are at work Looms continually for which above People from Eight Years old and upward are daily imploy'd in Carding Spinning  c  and consume above Packs of Wool weekly The Blankets are usually or Quarters wide and very white which some attribute to the abstersive nitrous Waters of the River  Windrush  wherewith they are scoured but others believe it is owing to a peculiar way of loose Spinning they use here and others again are of Opinion that it proceeds from both But however that be this Town has engrossed the whole Trade in that Commodity and increases daily in its Reputation They likewise make here the  Duffield  Stuffs a Yard and three Quarters wide which are carried to  New England  and  Virginia  and now much worn even here in Winter Here are likewise a great many Fellmongers who having dressed and stained their Sheepskins make them into Jackets and Breeches and sell them at  Bampton  from whence they are dispersed all over the neighbouring Counties Here is a good Freeschool and a fine Library belonging to it  Witney  is an antient Town and of good Repute before the Conquest but it is a long straggling uncouth Place tho' full of Inhabitants 'Twas one of the Manors which  Alwinus  Bishop of  Winchester  gave to the Church of  St Swithin  's there on Queen  Emma  's happily passing over the  Fire Ordeal    At  Astal  a Village in the Road between  Burford  and  Witney  is a Barrow which stands very high and is supposed to be the Sepulchre of some Person of great Note  Southward lies  Bampton  on the Borders of the County next  Berkshire  It is an antient Markettown  likewise in Repute before the Conquest it is noted for the greatest Market for Fellmongerwares in  England  which come from  Witney  and for nothing else that I know of saving that the People talk'd much of a Family of the  Woods  that dwelt here and at  Brisenorton  who hear always a great Knocking before any of them die  Turning here West we enter'd  Gloucestershire  again and came to  Lechlade  which lies on the great Road to  Gloucester  It is probable that it was antiently a  Roman  Town upon the  Thames  for a very plain  Roman  Road runs from hence to  Cirencester  Some say that it was once a famous University for teaching  Latin  as  Creeklade  was for  Greek    The antient Building lately discovered by digging in a Meadow near  Lechlade  deserves a particular Mention it is Feet long broad and Four high supported with Brick Pillars curiously inlaid with Stones of divers Colours of Tesseraick Work and supposed to be a  Roman  Bath  Not far from it are the Two Towns called  Sarney  so named in  British  from the  Roman  Causways for  Sarn  in that antient Language and at present imports a paved Way The River  Lech  runs thro' it and discharges itself into the  Thames  A great Number of Barges go from hence to  London    From  Lechlade  we proceeded West to  Fairford  a small Markettown thro' which runs the River  Coln  which has Two large Bridges over it A great many Medals and Urns have been often dug up here and there are several Barrows in the adjoining Fields which seem to have been a Scene of warlike Actions the Monuments of the Slain interred here  A great many Charities are still subsisting in this Town but what it is most noted for is its Church and the admirable Painting in its Windows of which take the following Description and History  John Tame  a Merchant of  London  purchased this Manor of King  Henry  VII to whom it descended from the  Beauchamps  Earls of  Warwick  and haveing taken a Prizeship bound for  Rome  wherein he found a great Quantity of painted Glass he brought both the Glass and the Workmen into  England  The Glass was such a Curiosity that Mr  Tame  built this Church at  Fairford  dedicating it to the Virgin  Mary  which is in Length Feet and in Breadth and has Three Chancels a good Vestry and a noble Tower arising from the Midst of it adorned with Pinacles and the Windows of the Church in Number he caused to be glazed with this invaluable Prize which remains intire to this Day the Admiration of all that see it  Mrs  Farmer  a Daughter of the Lord  Lemster  gave  l  to be laid out in mending and wiring the Windows this has preserved them from Accidents And in the grand Rebellion the Impropriator Mr  Oldworth  and others to their great Praise be it remembred took down the Glass and secured it in some secret Place thereby preserving it from Fanatick Rage The Painting was the Design of  Albert Durer  a famous  Italian  Master and the Colouring in the Drapery and some of the Figures is so well perform'd that  Vandyke  affirmed the Pencil could not exceed it  The Subject is all Scripture History  viz  The Serpent tempting  Eve  God appearing in the burning Bush to  Moses  when a Shepherd the Angel conducting  Joshua  to War  Gideon  's Fleece the Queen of  Sheba  's Visit to  Solomon  King  David  judging the  Amalekite  Regicide  Samson  slaying the  Philistines  killing the Lion and his being betray'd by  Dalilah    Solomon  's Judgment between the Two Harlots and the Figures of the Twelve Major Prophets  But the greatest Part is taken up with Stories of the  New Testament  The Angel appearing to  Zacharias    Joseph  and  Mary  contracted the Visitation of  Mary  by the Angel and her visiting her Cousin  Elizabeth  our Saviour born in a Stable the Shepherds and  Magi  visiting him there  Herod  waiting the Return of the wise Men Christ circumcised the Purification of the Holy Virgin  Simeon  with our Saviour in his Arms  Joseph  's Flight into  Egypt    Herod  slaying the young Children of  Bethlehem  the Assumption of the Virgin and  Joseph  and her seeking Jesus at the Feast our Saviour's Transfiguration  Mary  anointing his Head the Disciples going to embalm him and the Angel relating to them his Resurrection Christ's Appearance to  Mary Magdalen  his riding to  Jerusalem  on an Ass  Zaccheus  and the People strewing Palmbranches and Children crying  Hosanna  his Praying in the Garden  Judas  betraying him  Pilate  judging him and washing his Hands from the Guilt the Crucifixion between two Thieves the Women standing by and the Soldiers watching him  Joseph  of  Arimathea  begging the Body and receiving it his Burial by  Nicodemus  and others the Darkness at the Passion and  Michael  contending with the Devil  Christ's travelling to  Emmaus  and his Appearance to the Eleven and afterwards to  Thomas  the Disciples going a Fishing and Christ's appearing to them with the breaking of the Net and broiling of the Fish Christ's Ascension and the Descent of the Holy Ghost in cloven Tongues  In the West Window is the Last Judgment curiously designed and well executed containing a vast Number of Incidents relating thereto  In the rest of the Windows are many historical Passages that happened after Christ's Ascension  viz  The Twelve Apostles at large with the Article of the Creed they are said to be severally the Authors of  the Four Evangelists as writing the Gospels Four principal Fathers of the Church  viz  St  Jerom  St  Gregory  St  Ambrose  and St  Austin  the Worthies that have preserved the Christian Church in four Upperwindows of the Middle Ayle on the South Side and the Persecutors thereof in the four opposite Windows  I have been as brief as possible in this Description being so much confined in my Limits but a curious Traveller will be highly delighted with this noble Work And I shall only add That  John Tame    Esq  the pious and worthy Founder who died in the Year lies buried on the North Side of the Church under a raised Marble Monument  On the  Churn  one of the Rivers I have just named stands  Cirencester  or  Cicester  for Brevity the antient  Corinium  of the  Romans  and said to be rebuilt by  Cissa  a Viceroy under one of the  Saxon  Kings a great and populous City then inclosed with Walls and a Ditch of vast Compass which may be traced quite round The Foundation of the Wall is also very visible in most Places A good Part of this Circuit is now Pasture Corn Fields and Gardens besides the Scite of the present Town Antiquities are dug up here every Day old Foundations Houses and Streets and many  Mosaick  Pavements with Rings Intaglia's and Coins innumerable especially in one great Garden called  Lewis Grounds  which might have been the  Praetorium  or General's Quarters for  Llys  in  British  signifies a Palace Large Quantities of carved Stones are carried off yearly in Carts to mend the Highways besides what have been used in Building A fine  Mosaick  Pavement was dug up here  Anno  with many Coins One Mr  Richard Bishop  lately dug up in his Garden a Vault Feet long and broad supported with square Pillars of  Roman  Brick three Feet and an half high on which was a strong Floor of Terrace  Near it are now several other Vaults on which Cherrytrees grow These might have been the Foundations of a Temple for in the same Place they found several Stones of the Shafts of Pillars Six Feet long and large Stone Bases with Cornices very handsomely moulded and carved with Modilions and other Ornaments which are now converted into Swinetroughs and Pavements before the Door Capitals of these Pillars were likewise found A  Mosaick  Pavement near it and intire is now the Floor of his Privy  Half a Mile West of the Town on the North Side of the  Fosse  Road at a Place called  Quern  other Antiquities are to be seen worth an Antiquary's Attention but I must not take up too much Room in describing them  Little of the Abbey is now lest besides Two old and indifferent Gatehouses The Church is a very handsome Building the Windows are full of painted Glass and it has a fine lofty Tower East of the Town about a Quarter of a Mile is  Starbury Mount  a Barrow where  Roman  Coins have been dug up West behind Lord  Bathurst  's Garden is  Grismund  's  Mount  of which several Fables are told  Cirencester  is still a very good Town populous and rich full of Clothiers and driving a great Trade in Wool which is brought from the Inland Counties of  Leicester Northampton  and  Lincoln  where the largest Sheep in  England  feed and where are but few Manufactures The vast Quantities sold here are almost incredible The Wool is bought up here chiefly by the Clothiers of  Wiltshire  and  Gloucestershire  for the Supply of that great Cloathingtrade which I have mentioned already they talk of Packs in a Year  The Town is governed by Two High Constables It has Two weekly Markets one on  Monday  for Corn Cattle and Provisions and on  Friday  for  Wool chiefly It has also Five Fairs Three for all Sorts of Commodities and Two for Cloth only Here is a fine large beautiful Church with Two Ayles supported by strong Pillars The Chancel is handsomely decorated It has Five Chapels adjoining to it and has a Tower very neat and lofty with an excellent Ring of Bells in it The Windows shew some beautiful Remains of exquisite painted Glass There is a Freeschool and divers Hospitals and Almshouses in this Parish  The  Churn  runs from hence down Southward to  Creeklade  in  Wiltshire  which is said to have been antiently a very noted Place containing Houses and that an University was here founded by the antient  Britons  for teaching  Greek  as I have said as  Lechlade  was for  Latin  which University was removed as they pretend by the  Saxons  to  Oxon  but I doubt these are Monkish Accounts for  Creeklade  which they would have to signify a  Greek  Town is a Corruption of the  British  Word  Kerigg gwlade  i e a stony Country The  Churn  and the  Rey  fall here into the  Thames  Here is a good Freeschool  Northwest of  Cirencester  upon a Hill stands  Stroud  a little Markettown noted for Clothing and particularly for dying excellent Scarlet The Church is Feet long and broad The Chancel is Feet long and wide At the West End of the Church rises a high Spire Steeple and a Tower in the Middle  North of it stands  Paynswick  a Markettown situate in the wholsomest Air in the County on the River  Stroud  where the Cloathingtrade is also carried on The Church is a Vicarage and very handsome with Two Chancels a North Ayle and a neat Spire  Lower to the Southwest of  Cirencester  stands  Minching Hampton  so called because it belonged to the  Minching  Nuns at  Caen  in  Normandy  Here  is a good Rectory Church worth  l  a Year large in the Form of a Cross with Ayles on each Side and a Tower with Battlements rising in the Middle In the North Ayle are a great many Inscriptions of Benefactions And in the South Ayle is a Statue lying crosslegg'd with a Sword and Shield by him and his Wife lying at his Feet  Then we came to  Tetbury  one of the Cloathing Towns I mentioned a considerable Markettown situate on a rising Ground in a healthy Air but scarce of Water in Summer 'Tis wellbuilt has a large Markethouse well frequented for Yarn and there is a lesser Markethouse for Cheese Bacon and other Commodities 'Tis govern'd by a Bailiff and at the End of the Town is a long Bridge whereof one half is in  Wiltshire  The Church is a Vicarage worth  l  a Year 'tis a good Building large and handsome in which are divers Monuments Here is a Freeschool and an Almshouse It had formerly a Castle built by  Dunwallo Malmufius  a  British  Prince The Town seems to be well furnished with every thing but Water which is so scarce that the Inhabitants are obliged to buy it at the Rate sometimes of  d  for a Hogshead In this Parish rises the River  Avon  which runs thro'  Bristol  and afterwards falls into the  Severn    A little to the North of this Town is a Meadow called  Maudlin  Meadow because as I was told it belongs to  Magdalen  College in  Oxford  Here the Inhabitants shewed me the Head of a Spring which flowing from thence runs along a Hedgetrough and some Tops of the Wood that grows in the Hedge rotting and falling into this Rill of Water are by it turned into Stone I took up a great many of them which are generally in the Shape of the Pipes as they are commonly called which the Perukemakers curl their Hair upon and of a whitish stony Substance I broke divers of them and in the  middle found generally a Stick of Wood some as big as a Goosequill others larger some had but a thin stony Crust about them in others the Stick was no biggar than a large Needle again some had no Stick in them but only a Hole thro' them like that of a Tobacco Pipe and in some others I could perceive no woody Substance nor Hole at all but the Whole was a soft Kind of StoneHence I guess that the Sand which the Water brings down with it gathers and crusts about those Sticks and that in time the Stick consumes and the stony or sandy Substance fills up and supplies its Place And I would hence recommend it as an Inquiry Whether those other Transmutations of this Kind that we meet with in the Natural History of this and other Nations be not brought about in the like manner  And now I am dipp'd into this Work of Nature let me digress a little and take notice of the  Astroites  or Starstones found at  Lassington  in this County which have that peculiar Quality of Motion when put into VinegarIn the Fields near  Badminton  are found cylindrical and spherical Stones almost as big as Cannon Balls And on the Hills about  Aldely  are found Stones of the same Kind with those I found about  Watchet  in  Somersetshire  resembling all Kinds of Shellfish these I must confess are of the two more astonishing because they are found on the Hills for if they were as  Fracastorius  conjectures Animals ingendered in the Sea no good Account of their being here found can be given unless we suppose them brought hither by the general DelugeThe Water of the River  Stroud  in this County is esteemed the best for Dying Scarlets which draws many Clothiers to settle in that Neighbourhood And lest I should be thought too tedious let me but just mention the Diamonds  Bristol  Stones rather found near the Banks of the River  Avon  That soft easytobewrought Stone at  Great Banington    called  Puffstone  prodigiously strong and lasting a great deal af of which hath been used in the Repairs of  Westminster  Abbey  Wickwar  a small Markettown but a very antient Corporation governed by a Mayor is the next The Church is a large Edifice with Two Chancels The Tower is at the West End and is high adorn'd with Pinacles Here is a Freeschool  Chipping Sodbury  lies a little farther in the Road an antient Boroughtown under a Mayor Aldermen and Burgesses As it is a great Thoroughfare to  Bristol  it is full of good Inns It has several Streets besides Lanes and a good Market and a large spacious Church which however is but a Chapel of Ease to  Old Sodbury  Here is the greatest Cheesemarket in  England  except  Atherstone  in  Warwickshire    Here we dropp'd the Road and fell down Southward directly to  Marshfield  another of the Cloathing Towns I spoke of It consists of one Street of old Buildings near a Mile long It has a Market and drives also a great Trade in Malt and is noted for good Cakes 'Tis governed by a Bailiff Here is a good Vicarage Church with several Monuments and Inscriptions in the Ayles and the Chancel Here is an Almshouse well endow'd and a Chapel to it  We crossed the great Road from  London  to  Bristol  here as at  Cirencester  we did that from  London  to  Gloucester  and keeping still the Fosseway arrived at  Bath  But here I shall conclude this Letter and am Sir  Yours c  LETTER V CONTAINING A Description of Part of the Counties of  Somerset Gloucester Warwick Worcester Hereford  and  Monmouth    SIR  _I Closed my last Letter with my Arrival at BATH in  Somersetshire  and I shall now proceed with giving you an Account of what is most remarkable in it  The Antiquity of this City and of the famous Baths in it must be allow'd to be very great even tho' we should doubt of what is insisted on in the Inscription under the Figure of King  Bladud  placed in the King's Bath which says that this Prince whom Mr  Camden  calls  Blayden  or  Bladen Cloyth  i e  Southsayer  found out the Use of these Baths Years before our Saviour's Time  Bath  is a Spot of Ground which our Countrymen ought to esteem as a particular Favour of Heaven It lies in a great Valley surrounded with an Amphitheatrical View of Hills and its Situation on the West Side of the Island is a considerable Addition to its Delights as being the less liable to the rude Shocks of  Tempests But the  Romans  were induced prudently to make a Station here by the admirable hot Springs The Walls are almost intire and perhaps the Work of the  Romans  except the upper Part which seems repaired with the Ruins of  Roman  Buildings for the Lewisholes are still left in many of the Stones and to the Shame of the Repairers many  Roman  Inscriptions some sawn across to fit the Size of the Place The Level of the City is risen to the Top of the first Walls thro' the Negligence of the Magistracy who in this and all other great Towns connive at the Servants throwing Dirt and Ashes into the Streets These Walls inclose but a small Compass of a pentagonal Form There are four Gates on four Sides and a Postern on the other From the Southwest Angle have been an additional Wall and Ditch carried out to the River by which short Work the Approach of an Enemy on two Sides is intercepted unless they pass the River The small Compass of the City has made the Inhabitants croud up the Streets to an unseemly and inconvenient Narrowness It is however handsomely built mostly of new Stone which is very white and good The great Additions made and still making to the Buildings here I shall mention byandby  It was of old a Resort for Cripples and diseased Persons and we see the Crutches hang up at the several Baths as the Thankofferings of those who came hither lame and went away cured But now we may say it is a Resort of the Sound as well as the Sick and a Place that helps the Indolent and the Gay to commit that worst of Murders that is to say to kill  Time    To such it is indeed a constant Round of Diversion In the Morning the young Lady is brought in a close Chair dressed in her Bathingcloaths to the  Crossbath  There the Musick plays her into the Bath and the Women who tend her present her  with a little floating Wooden Dish like a Bason in which the Lady puts a Handkerchief and a Nosegay and of late the Snuffbox is added She then traverses the Bath if a Novice with a Guide if otherwise by herself and having amus'd herself near an Hour calls for her Chair and returns to her Lodgings  The rest of the Diversion is at Mrs  Hayes  's formerly  Harrison  's a stately Room and Mrs  Wiltshire  's who has now the Apartments that were the late Mrs  Lindsey  's where not long since was the Bowlinggreen And perhaps Mr  Leake  who keeps one of the finest Booksellers Shops in  Europe  has more than a Chance for half an Hour of each Person's Company nowandthen and to be sure a Subscription which is but five Shillings the Season for taking home what Book you please but Persons of Quality generally subscribe Gold and I think it is the very best Money laid out in the Place for those who go for Pleasure or Amusement only In the Afternoon there is frequently a Play tho' the Decorations are mean and indeed the Performances too In the Evening People assemble at the great Rooms and there are Balls twice a Week 'Tis also the Fashion of the Place for the Company to go every Day pretty constantly to hear Divine Service at the great Church and at  St Mary  's Chapel in  Queen'ssquare  where are Prayers twice a Day  'Tis remarkable that for many Hundreds of Years the Medicinal Virtues of these Waters have been useful to the diseased People by Batheing only whereas of late Years they are found to be no less healthful in many Cases taken inwardly insomuch that more come to drink than to bathe nor are the Cures they perform this way less valuable than the outward Application  Gaming used to obtain here as at all publick Places to a scandalous Degree but the Act prohibiting  that pernicious Practice has a good deal checked its Progress This Act passed in the th of King  George  II and suppresses on the Penalty of  l  and  l  the Adventures the following Games by Name  viz  The  Ace of Hearts Pharaoh Basset Hazard  also all  Sales Raffles Lotteries Mathematical Machines  c  Sales by Lotteries  are declared void and what is put up by them forfeited nor are Convictions to be vacated for want of Form  But this Act being eluded by new Games set up a Clause was inserted in the  Horseracing  Act  Anno    Geo  II prohibiting  Passage  and all other Games with Dice except what are play'd on the  Backgamon  Tables  As to the more particular Nature and Virtues of the Waters I have been favoured by a very eminent Physician with the following curious Account of tham and their Original  Of  Bath  Waters  The  Bath  Waters certainly owe their Heat to a Mixture and Fermentation of two different Sources distilling from the Tops of two different Mountains  Clarton  and  Landsdown  meeting in the Valley where the Town stands for all Hills are Nests of Metals or Minerals and their Bellies are cavernous and hollow It is not therefore improbable that on  Clarton Down  there should lie the sulphurous Matter which must rise by Impregnation from that excellent Stone Quarry which hardens in the Air and grows cased with a nitrous Coat by Time and cold Weather and is so readily cut out and carved into any the most exquisite Shapes This the Discovery and Property of the worthy charitable and pious  Ralph Allen    Esq  For all Mineral Waters owe their Virtue to an Impregnation of Rain Water generated from the Clouds which are compressed in their Course by  Mountains or Eminences and fall on the respective included Mineral And every one knows that a due Mixture of Sulphur and Filings of Iron moistened with Water will produce any Degree of Heat This Quarry therefore must have a large Quantity of sulphurous or bituminous Matter in its Composition as will be evident to a Natural Philosopher from these mentioned Qualities of the Stone Neither is it improbable that the ferruginous or irontinctured Water takes its Rise from  Lansdown  Quarry the Stone on it being hard and on the Top flinty black and acrimonious as Iron Ore is known to be These Two Mountains thus tinged by Rain Water falling from the proper Heights meet in some Caverns in the Valley and there fermenting produce that hot milky soft salutiferous Beverage called  Bath Water  far beyond any hot mineral Waters for its Delicacy and supportable tho' comfortable Heat to any other such Water hitherto discovered on the habitable Globe as it possesses that Milkiness Detergency and middling Heat so friendly adapted to weaken'd animal Constitutions which all other hot Waters want in the due Degree either being too hot or too cold to do any great Good in Cases where they are proper These Waters are beneficial in almost all chronical Distempers and can hurt in none except in Hemorrhages Inflammations or bad Lungs unless they be overdosed in Quantity or too high and too hot a Regimen be joined with them for they always procure a great Appetite and good Spirits if cautiously managed but if high Meats and strong Liquors be indulged they will create inflammatory Disorders However in weak Stomachs decayed Appetites Colicks low Spirits in the Intervals of the Fits of the Gout and Stone in Rheumatisms Palsies nervous Disorders and in a Word all those called the Cold Diseases but most eminently in all the Disorders of the chyliferous Tube  or the Stomach and Belly not inflamed they are more kindly and beneficial than any Medicine known in Nature and introduce a natural Warmth and a new internal Heat into decayed wornout superannuated Constitutions and if a light Regimen due Exercise and good Hours be joined with them they would truly work Wonders but by the Neglect of these their Efficacy is often lost and their Credit brought into Question  Great Additions have been made to the Buildings here within these few Years particularly by the Duke of  Chandos    Without the Walls a stately new Square is erected with a fine Chapel and the Middle is inclosed by Rails and handsomely laid out within  In the Centre is a lofty Obelisk Feet high from the Foundation and terminated in a Point Level with one's Eye is the inclosed Inscription  IN MEMORY  OF HONOUR BESTOW'D  AND IN GRATITUDE  FOR BENEFITS CONFERR'D  IN THIS CITY  BY HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS  FREDERICK  PRINCE  OF  WALES    AND HIS ROYAL  CONSORT    IN THE YEAR MDCCXXXVIII  THIS OBELISK IS ERECTED  BY  RICHARD NASH    Esq  The  Bathstone  which I have mention'd before affords a fine Opportunity to imbellish and give a noble Look to the Buildings here and at a very cheap Rate for the Front of the Houses on the North Side of the Square cost no more than  l  tho' it is above Feet in Extent and inriched with Columns  and Pilasters in the  Corinthian Order  All the Danger is that they will overbuild themselves now they are got into the Humour and make it less worth while to those who let Lodgings the principal Business of the Place but then People of Fortune settling there will make amends for it since no less than or Families are already become constant Inhabitants and others are daily taking Houses  The Grove too near the Abbeychurch now called  Orangesquare  in Compliment to the Prince of  Orange  when there has several handsome newbuilt Houses and a monumental Stone is erected with an Inscription in Honour to the Prince of  Orange  and the Place his Highness having been obliged to visit  Bath  for his Health just before he married the Princess Royal of  England  and received great Benefit by the Waters This likewise was erected by the famous Mr  Nash  to whose good Management and Behaviour  Bath  is greatly indebted every one submitting with Delight to the Regulations he imposes with regard to Decorum and the Oeconomy of the Place  The Inscription on the Stone above is as follows  In Memoriam  Sanitatis  Principi Auriaco  Aquarum Thermalium Potu  Favente DEO  Ovante  BRITANNIA  Feliciter Restitutae  MDCCXXXV  Thus translated  In Memory of the happy Restoration of the Health of the Prince of  Orange  by the drinking of the  Bath  Waters thro' the Favour of GOD and to the extreme Joy of  Britain    General  Wade  one of the Representatives in Parliament for this City has given a fine Altarpiece to the great Church there He has also been at the Charge of having the Picture drawn of every one of his Electors the Members of the Corporation and set up round the Townhall and his own too he has  suffer'd to be put up over the Entrance as if he would make good that Pass and keep them all to  Duty  At the Upperend of the Hall are lately set up the Pictures of the Prince and Princess of  Wales  a Present made by their Royal Highnesses to the Corporation who likewise before presented it with a fine large wrought Silver Cup and Waiter gilt  There is a very great Narrowness of Spirit in most of the Inhabitants at  Bath  but indeed it is the same in all publick Places of Resort They have but their  Seasons  and they are so hungry by that time they come about that they look upon a new Comer as a Person to be  shared  and  divided  among them for this Reason you'll always find them with  both  Hands open to  receive  and not  one  to  communicate  or do a  generous  Office without a Benefit in  Possession  or  Reversion  And when they receive a Favour at your Hands 'tis with such an Air as if it were their  Due  and they quitted Scores with you by their Acceptance of it  The  Abbeychurch  is a venerable Pile and has many Monuments in it But the principal Front is almost blasphemously decorated if it may be call'd decorated with the Figures of God the Father and Saints and Angels the Work of Superstition This Cathedral tho' beautiful is but small and on the Spot probably stood the  Roman  Temple of  Minerva  Patroness of the Baths Before it was an handsome square Area but of late Years deformed with Houses  On the South Side are the justly renowned hot Springs collected into a square Area called  the King's Bath  The Corporation erected within these few Years that pretty neat Building before it call'd  the Pumproom  for the Company to meet in who drink the Water convey'd hither by a Marble Pump from the Bottom of the Springs where it is near boilinghot  This Water is admirably grateful to the Stomach striking the Roof of the Mouth with a fine sulphurous and steely Taste like that of the  German Spaw  or  Pyrmont  Tho' you drink off a large Pintglass it is so far from creating a Heaviness or Nausea that you immediately perceive yourself more alert At first it operates by Stool and especially Urine It is of sovereign Efficacy to strengthen the Bowels restore their lost Tone and renew the vital Heat But I have already mention'd its excellent Qualities  The King's Bath  is an oblong Square the Walls full of Niches perhaps the  Romans  Work There are Twelve on the North Side Eight on the East and West about Four larger Arches on the South At every Corner are the Steps to descend into it and a Parapet or Balustrade with a Walk round it  The Springs were doubtless separated from common Springs by the  Romans  and fenced in with a durable Wall There goes a probable Tradition of subterranean Canals of their making to carry off the other Waters lest they should mix with these and destroy the Heat  It is remarkable that at the cleansing of the Springs when they set down a new Pump they constantly find great Quantities of Hazelnuts as in many other Places among subterraneous Timber These Dr  Stukeley  doubts not are the Remainder of the universal Deluge which the  Hebrew  Historian tell us was in Autumn Providence by that means securing the Revival of the Vegetable World  In the Bath People stand up to the Chin Men and Women and stew mostly in the way of Gallantry  Many are the Diseases which here find a Remedy when judiciously applied as I observ'd above The Confleunce hither is greater in Summer than in Winter tho' the latter of the two seems the more preferable Season for medicinal Purposes  Behind the Southern Wall of  the King's Bath  is a less Square named  the Queen's Bath  with a Tabernacle of Four Pillars in the midst This is of more temperate Warmth as borrowing its Water from the other There are likewise Pumps and Pumpingrooms for pouring hot Streams on any Part of the Body which in many Cases is very salutary  In the Southwest Part of the Town are two other Baths not to be disregarded  The Hotbath  is not much inferior in Heat to  the King's Bath  it is a small Parallelogram with a Stone Tabernacle of Four Pillars in the midst  The Crossbath  near it is triangular and had a Cross in the middle Hard by is an Hospital built and endow'd by a Prelate of this See The Water in these two Places rises near the Level of the Streets  On the South Side of the Cathedral are some Parts of the Abbey left and the Gatehouse belonging to it  Within these few Years by a Contribution a cold Bath for the Benefit of the Infirm was made at a Spring beyond the Bridge  Two  Roman  Inscriptions have been set in the Eastern Wall of the Cathedral fronting the Walks which besides the Injuries of the Weather are exposed to the mischievous Sport of Boys who throw Stones at them  The several Baths are very indifferently kept as their Use so much increases But a fine Design is now on foot to make convenient Slips with Dressingrooms and Apartments for Pumping on People without going into the Bath and for inlarging the Pumproom so as to hold four or five Pumps  The greatest Decency is observed here by both Sexes and while Mr  Nash  lives it must be always so There is a very good Conveniency of Chairs of which there are great Plenty and very genteel ones  to go to any Part within the Walls and even to the adjoining Buildings without for  d  provided the Distance does not exceed Yards but if it does the Fare is  s  and for this the Chairmen are obliged to go a Mile In short it is a delightful Place enough when you are in it but a dreadful one to come at down high Hills in some Places like Precipices but Health or Pleasure obliges People to dispense with this Difficulty  Bath  being invironed with Hills there are few pleasant Walks out of the Town or even Rides without clambering much to  Landsdownhill  or that called  Clartondown    It is for this Reason that very few People care to keep Coaches here And the Hill up to  Lansdown  particularly is so steep that the late Queen  Anne  was extremely frighted in going up her Coachman stopping to give the Horses Breath and the Coach wanting a Dragstaff it ran back in spite of all the Coachman's Skill the Horses not being brought to strain the Harness again or pull together for a good while and the Coach putting the Guards behind in great Confusion at last some of the Servants setting their Heads and Shoulders to the Wheels stopt them by mere Force  The General Hospital now near finished in this City for the Reception of the sick Poor all over the Kingdom is a very noble Design The first Stone of it was laid the th of  July  It is built where the old Playhouse stood and is a noble Pile of Building Feet in Front and Feet deep It is capable of receiving poor Cripples Its chief Benefactor is Mr  Allen  of whom we shall say more anon who gave all the Wallstone Freestone ready wrought Pavingstone and Lime used in it The Prince and Princess of  Wales  have likewise been great Promoters of the Work  A very great Design is now also begun in this City of which the following is a brief Account  On the th of  March  the first Stone of a new Square was laid in the Gardens adjoining to the publick Walks The principal Side of this Square is to have the Appearance of one House Feet in Front and Feet in Depth but is to be divided into Houses each Front is to have Windows and each End Two of the other Sides are to serve as Wings to the principal Side each Wing is to contain Houses upon a perfect Square of Feet and the Front of these Wings are every one to have Windows so that when the whole Building is viewed in Front it will shew Windows extend Feet and from the distant Hills look like one grand Palace The three Piles of Building will be adorned with above Columns and Pilasters in the  Corinthian  OrderUpon the Corner of every Pile there will be a Tower and in every Front will be a Centrehouse and a Pediment  A noble House for publick Assemblies is to be erected by Subscription in this Square the Ballroom will be like an  Egyptian  Hall and contain in Length Feet and Breadth Feet The Assemblyroom will be Feet long There will be a Garden for the Ladies to walk in a Bowlinggreen for the Gentlemen a grand Parade of Yards long a Terrace Yards in Circumference a Portico of the same Dimensions with divers other Walks in common for all People and so disposed that Gentlemen and Ladies may walk at any Season of the Year at any Hour of the Day and in any Weather So that by these great Improvements  Bath  will be rendered one of the most agreeable Places in the World for facing this Square a Bridge with an Arch of Feet opening will be built over the River by which People of Distinction may go to  the  Downs  as into their own Gardens for the Air and Exercise  The River  Avon  runs by the Back of the Town and on the Banks of it Mr  Allen  who is the Genius of the Place and whose Works and Inventions there next to the Waters are better worth the Attention of the Curious than any thing in  Bath  has a fine Wharf and other convenient Places to shape to work to imbark the Stones of many Tons Weight which he digs from the Quarry on the adjacent Hill This he does by an admirable Machine which runs down the Hill by Grooves placed in the Ground without Horses or any other Help than one Man to guide it who also by a particular Spring can stop it in the steepest Part of the Hill and in the swiftest Part of its Motion These Stones he can carry by the  Avon  to  Bristol  whence they may be transported to any other Part of  England  and the new Works of  St Bartholomew's  Hospital  London  are built with them He is building for himself a very magnificent House of this Stone with a fine Chapel and noble Stables and Offices and has delightful Gardens laid out with a Profusion of Fancy yet with great Oeconomy as to the Expence for in short Mr  Allen  is contented with the Situation of his House and Gardens and indeed well he may for it is a very fine one and instead of forcing Nature by a great Expence to bend to Art he pursues only what the natural Scite points out to him and by so doing will make it one of the cheapest and at the same time one of the most beautiful Seats in  England  He levels no Hills but enjoys the Beauty of the Prospects they afford he cuts down no Woods but strikes thro' them fine Walks and nexttonatural Mazes and has by that means a delightful Grove always filled with Birds which afford the rural Ear a Musick transcending all others Nor does he want for fine Conveniencies  of Water and as he is a Gentleman who is not enter'd into the present fashionable Schemes of ridiculing Religion and Scripture he has a Figure of  Moses  striking the Rock and the Water gushing out of it which forms a sort of natural Cascade whence his Bason is supplied and is a pretty Allusion to his producing all his Works from the Stone Quarry in his Neighbourhood This is the same Mr  Allen  who first invented the CrossPost so useful for the Conveyance of Letters to Places which before were in that Particular at the greatest Uncertainty The Taste of this Gentleman in his Gardening  c  is so aptly described by Mrs  Chandler  of the Place in an ingenious Poem called  The Description of  BATH that the following Quotation from it must be acceptable  Thy Taste refin'd appears in yonder Wood  Not  Nature  tortur'd but by  Art  improv'd  Where  cover'd Walks  with  open Vistas  meet  An  Area  here and there a  shady Seat  A thousand Sweets in mingled Odours flow  From blooming  Flow'rs  which on the Borders grow  In num'rous Streams the murm'ring Waters thrill  Uniting all obedient to thy Will  Till by thy Art in  one Canal  combin'd  They thro' the  Wood  in various  Mazes  wind  From thence the foaming Waves fall rapid down  In bold  Cascades  and lash the rugged Stone  But here their Fury lost the calmer Scene  Delights the softer Muse and S  ul serene  An ample  Bason  Centre of the Place  In Lymph transparent holds the scaly Race  Its glassy Face from ev'ry Ruffle free  Reflects the Image of each neighb'ring Tree  On which the  feather'd Choir  's melodious Throng  By Love inspir'd unite in tuneful Song  Their tuneful Song the echoing  Woods  resound  And falling  Waters  add a solemn Sound  Sure this the Muses haunt 'tis hallow'd Ground  At  Walcot  has been a Camp and many  Roman  Antiquities have been found Lord  Winchelsea  has an Urn a Patera and other things taken out of a Stone Coffin wherein was a Child's Body half a Mile off the  Bath    When one is upon  Kingsdown  and has pass'd all the Steeps and Difficulties of the Ascent there is a plain and pleasant Country for many Miles into  Gloucestershire  and two very noble Houses the one built by Mr  Blathwait  late Secretary at War and the other is call'd  Badmington  a Mansion of the Duke of  Beaufort    Nor must we forget to mention the handsome Monument erected by Order of the late Lord  Lansdown  to the Honour of Sir  Bevil Granville  his Lordship's Ancestor with an Inscription recording the Action in which he fell It is built on the Brow of  LansdownHill  on the very Spot as near as possible where that brave Gentleman was kill'd in the Action between him and Sir  William Waller  in the late Civil Wars of which Lord  Clarendon  and others give Account  I ought not to omit that in the Session of Parliament an Act passed for inlarging the Terms and Powers granted by Two former Acts of Parliament for Repairing and Inlarging the Highways between the Top of  KingsdownHill  and the City of  Bath  and for Amending several other Roads leading from  Bristol  and other Places to  Bath  and for  cleansing paving  and  enlightening  the STREETS and regulating the CHAIRMEN there and for keeping a regular Nightly WATCH within the said City and Liberties All which when effected according to the Intention of the Act will be a great Conveniency to  Bath  and to Persons resorting to it  I will just mention also that at  ChippingNortonLane  near  Bath  was a Fight between the Forces  of King  James  II and those of the Duke of  Monmouth  in which the latter had the Advantage and if they had pursu'd it would have gain'd a complete Victory An old ElmTree standing near  StantonDrew  in a Road leading three Ways afforded a sad Testimony of the Event of the Duke's Enterprize for it was all overspread with the Heads and Limbs of the unfortunate Persons engag'd in his Cause who suffer'd by the Sentence of the merciless  Jefferies    About  Twyfordton  not far from  Bath  is a fallow Field call'd  MarsburyField  with but little Quantity of Earth upon the Rock This was very full of fossile Shells which had preserv'd their natural Colour of Blue and White as perfectly as at first  In  Chu  Parish is  Bowditch  so call'd from its circular Form it was a large Camp on a Hill trebly fortified whence you may behold the Isles of  Flatholm  and  Steepholm  in the Sea Here is a petrifying Spring This Country abounds with Coalpits The Slates which lie upon it and have not receiv'd their due Quantity of Sulphur so as to make perfect Coal are most curiously mark'd with Impressions of Plants particularly those of Fern This is indeed a Rock full of Springs a very bad Road for Travelling consisting of short and steep Valleys narrow Lanes intricate dark and hard The Ground is very rich and bears much Wood The Neatness of the Houses even of the poorer Sort of People is remarkable being generally whited over and imbellish'd with little Gardens We come in Ten Miles from  Bath  to the City of  Bristol  the greatest the richest and the best Port of Trade in  GreatBritain London  only excepted  Bristol  has been formerly a Place of Strength and had a Castle in which King  Stephen  was kept Prisoner some time by  Maud  the Empress It was besieged in the Civil Wars and made a good Defence The Castle stood till the Time of  Oliver Cromwell    who demolish'd it It is a CountyTown and one of King  Henry  VIII's new Bishopricks  The Merchants of this City have not only the greatest Trade but they trade with a more intire Independency upon  London  than any other Town in  Britain  And 'tis evident in this Particular  viz  That whatsoever Exportations they make to any Part of the World they are able to bring the full Returns back to their own Port and can dispose of them there which is not the Case in any other Port in  England  where they are often oblig'd either to ship part of the Effects in the Ports abroad on the Ships bound to  London  or to consign their own Vessels to  London  in order both to get Freight and dispose of their own Cargoes  But the  Bristol  Merchants as they have a very great Trade abroad so they have always Buyers at home for their Returns and that such Buyers that no Cargo is too big for them To this Purpose the Shopkeepers in  Bristol  who in general are Wholesalemen have so great an Inland Trade among all the Western Counties that they maintain Carriers just as the  London  Tradesmen do to all the principal Countries and Towns from  Southampton  in the South even to the Banks of the  Trent  North although they have no navigable River that Way  Add to this That as well by Sea as by the Navigation of two great Rivers the  Wye  and the  Severn  they have the whole Trade of  SouthWales  as it were to themselves and the greatest Part of that of  NorthWales  and as to their Trade to  Ireland  it is prodigiously increas'd since the Revolution notwithstanding the great Trade which of late the Merchants of  Liverpool  also drive with that Kingdom  The greatest Inconveniencies of  Bristol  are its Situation its narrow Streets and the Narrowness of its River and we might mention also another  Narrow  that is the  Minds  of the Generality of its People for let me tell you the Merchants of  Bristol  tho' very rich are not like the Merchants of  London  the latter may be said as of old of the Merchants of  Tyre  to vie with the Princes of the Earth whereas the former being rais'd by good Fortune and Prizes taken in the Wars from Masters of Ships and blunt Tars have imbib'd the Manners of these rough Gentlemen so strongly that they transmit it to their Descendants only with a little more of the Sordid than is generally to be found among the  British  Sailors and I would advise the rich ones among them if they would be a little more polite and generous than they usually are to  travel  but not out of  England  neither I mean only to  London  that is from the second great Trading Town to the first and they will see Examples worth their Imitation as well for princely Spirit as upright and generous Dealings  The Corporation being very tenacious in not admitting Persons to trade in their Liberty who are not Freemen there are not so many new Buildings and Improvements of Streets  c  at  Bristol  as would otherwise be As for the City itself there is hardly Room to set another House in it The great Square called  Queen  's formerly the  Mead  where the Ground was subject to the Hazard of Inundations is now so rais'd that it is free from that Inconvenience It is very handsomely built and inhabited and a fine Equestrian Statue of King  William  III erected in the middle of it done by the famous  Rysbrack    The Quay along the River is very noble and well filled with all Sorts of Merchandize and a handsome Row of Houses fronts it And I was inform'd when I was there last that in order to make the Back of this City more commodious than ever the Corporation have purchased several Houses adjoining to the BackGate in order to pull them down and  make all flush from the Conduit on the Back clear round to the Quay which when finish'd will be one of the completest Harbours in  Europe  This Quay is reckoned the longest in  England  It has a Crane on it the Workmanship of the late ingenious Mr  Padmore  which is not to be equalled in  Europe  The Merchants are greatly benefited by it in the extraordinary Dispatch it gives to the discharging of their Ships  CollegeGreen  is deemed the healthiest Situation in the City  There is erected within these few Years an Assembly Room for Entertainment and Amusement of the Gay as at other considerable Places for Luxury must always follow Riches It is a very handsome Building and stands in the Way from the City to the  Hotwell    The old Theatre at  StokesCroft  is also alter'd into a commodious Room for an Assembly which is held every  Tuesday  during the Winter  There were when I was there no less than fifteen GlassHouses in  Bristol  which is more than are in the City of  London  they use indeed themselves a very great Number of Glass Bottles which they send fill'd with Beer Cyder and Wine to the  WestIndies  much more than goes from  London  also vast Numbers of Bottles are now used for sending the Water of St  Vincent  's Rock not only all over  England  but we may say all over the World  This  Hotwell  or Water of St  Vincent  's Rock is without the City at the Confluence of the two little Rivers and on the Northside of the Stream Not many Years since this Spring lay open at the Foot of the Rock and was covered by the salt Water at every Tide and yet it preserved both its Warmth and Virtue intire  The Rock tho' hard to Admiration has since that been work'd down partly by Labour and partly  blown in Pieces by Gunpowder and an handsome large House is built upon it where they have good Apartments for entertaining distemper'd Persons The Well is secur'd and a good Pump is fix'd in it so that they have the Water pure and unmix'd from the Spring itself and they export vast Quantities for this Water keeps its Virtue better than that of  Bath    The following curious Account of the  Bristol  Waters I am indebted for to the same eminent Physician who favoured me with the learned Account of the Nature and Efficacy of the  Bath  and  Tunbridge  Waters  The  Bristol  Waters he says seem only a natural Limewater or pure Element impregnated with a natural unburnt Limestone All the Hills and Mountains round that Water are nothing but a Quarry of natural unburnt Limestone which is daily dug up there for Building and manifests itself to the Senses This makes these  Bristol  Waters one of the purest best and most salutary mere aqueous Elements on the Globe to cool all overheated Bowels and to lessen all preternatural Discharges But the small  Milkwarmth  in them when immediately pump'd up upon the Well's being drain'd of the Influx of the Tide shews there is some other Principle in them besides natural Limestone and that in Nature can be no other than some weak Impregnation of Sulphur with Nitre or Sea Salt or perhaps a slight Touch of Iron The Stones are some reddish some blackish that are digg'd out of the Mountains circumjacent but all of them natural Limestone These reddish and blackish Colours in the Stones necessarily imply Sulphur and Iron and these Three Principles by chymical Processes and Mixtures are discovered in some small Proportion in the Waters They are excellent in all scorbutick and nervous Atrophies in Hecticks weak Lungs all Inflammations in whatever  Part all preternatural Evacuations in short in all acrid Juices and viscid Blood being a natural Simple  Alcali  and in the first Stages of a  Phthisis Pulmonum  and if early had recourse to and long continued under a low cooling nutritive Regimen they would probably stop the Growth and Causes of most chronical Distempers  There are Parishes in the City but Churches including the Cathedral and the Church of  St Mark  There are besides those Churches several Meetinghouses for the different Sectaries  viz  Independents Quakers and Baptists  The Cathedral is far from extraordinary  Several of the Churches are very neat and beautifully decorated and worthy a Traveller's Attention That of  St Mary Radcliffe  or  Redcliff  is a noble and stately Edifice It is very large and spacious and has a fine Steeple or Tower  In it is a very antient Monument for Mr  William Cannings  Burgess and Merchant of  Bristol  the Founder of the Church and a great Benefactor otherwise to the City of  Bristol    On one Part of the Monument is a  Latin  Inscription full of Abbreviations and on the other Side in  English  an Inscription to his Praise which I have not room to insert  Here is also an Inscription on the Monument of Sir  William Penn  Knt ViceAdmiral of  England  the Father of the great  William Penn  one of the Heads of the  Quakers  who was a Native of the City of  Bristol    A great Face of Seriousness and Religion appears at  Bristol  and the Magistrates are laudably strict in exacting the Observation of the Sabbath considering the general Dissoluteness that has broken in almost everywhere else  One thing they deserve high Commendation for and that is the Neatness observ'd in keeping their Churches and the Care they take in preserving the  Monuments and Inscriptions of those bury'd in 'em A Practice scandalously neglected almost everywhere else in  England  and even at Places we might mention where Money another scandalous Practice is exacted for seeing them This Care of the Monuments of the Dead brings many Visitors to their Churches of travelling Strangers who are always pleas'd with it and make Comparisons in its Favour tho' very little to the Credit of some others who are more negligent 'Tis indeed strange That the Heirs and Families of the Deceased should not think themselves more concern'd than they generally are to keep up the Monuments of their Ancestors With great Piety and at a great Expence the next Heir or the most oblig'd rears a Monument to the Deceas'd and it is dedicated too professedly to Posterity In a very little while the Monument is cover'd with Dust and Cobwebs and the Inscription often effaced Common Decency does not succeed to this Piety and it becomes a Monument of the Ingratitude or Neglect of the Survivors rather than an Honour to the Deceas'd  Methinks Vanity alone the common Inducement to these Erections should inspire another Manner of Acting I cannot account for it any other way but that from the Prince to the Peasant as a Family generally lies together in one Vault or Tomb very few are willing to see or think of their Coffins and hence it is That some Men often look upon their very Heirs as  Memento Mori's  Unhappy Narrowness of Mind equally to be lamented and despis'd  Bristol  is supposed to have an hundred thousand Inhabitants in the City and within three Miles of its Circumference and they say above Three Thousand Sail of Ships belong to that Port  'Tis very remarkable That this City is so well supply'd with Coals that tho' they are all brought by Land Carriage yet they are generally laid down  at the Doors of the Inhabitants at seven eight or nine Shillings  per  Chaldron  The Situation of the City is low but on the Side of a rising Hill The Ground Plat of it is said very much to resemble that of old  Rome  being circular with a something greater Diameter one way than another but enough to make it oval and the River cutting off one small Part as it were a Sixth or less from the rest  The Bridge over the  Avon  is exceeding strong the Arches very high because of the Depth of Water and the Buildings so close upon it that in passing the Bridge you see nothing but an intire fullbuilt Street The Tide of Flood rises here near six Fathom and runs very strong  They draw all their heavy Goods here on  Sleds  or  Sledges  which they call  Geehoes  without Wheels This kills a Multitude of Horses and the Pavement is worn so smooth by them that in wet Weather the Streets are very slippery and in frosty Weather 'tis dangerous walking  The noble Charities of Mr  Edward Colston  a worthy Merchant of  Bristol  and his Foundations are an Honour to the Place and to the Memory of that excellent Man and I am sorry that my narrow Limits will not permit me to give a particular Account of them  But I ought not to omit that one of his Charities only cost him  l  and that is the noble Hospital or Almshouse erected by him in the Year upon his own Ground on  St Michael'sHill  The Front and two Sides are fac'd with Freestone it contains a Chapel neatly adorn'd Apartments and other Conveniencies for Men and Women The elder Brother receives  s  and each of the others  s  weekly besides an Allowance for Coal  c  To a Clergyman is paid the Sum of  l  yearly for reading the  Common  Prayer  twice every Day except when Prayers are read in  St Michael  's Church at which every Member of this Almshouse is to attend  In the Year he also purchas'd a Piece of Ground in  Templestreet  and built at his own Charge a School and Dwellinghouse for a Master to instruct Boys in Writing Arithmetick and the Church Catechism The Boys are likewise to be cloathed  And his other Charities and Benefactions were without Number  On  St Peter  's Day  June  was open'd at the Mint an Infirmary for this City for the Reception of the sick lame and distressed Poor after the Example of those in  London Winchester  c It is denominated  St Peter  's Hospital and very liberal Contributions have been made to it and particularly we are told that  John Elbridge    Esq  Comptroller of the Customs in this City who dy'd  February  besides many other charitable Donations bequeathed  l  to this Infirmary besides endowing a Charity School on  St Michael  's Hill which he built several Years before his Death for educating and cloathing a certain Number of poor Girls  Large Pieces of Ground are clear'd for building a Market and a magnificent Exchange the former in  Highstreet  and the latter in  Cornstreet  The old Buildings which have been destroy'd for that Purpose have cost the Chamber of this City upwards of Twenty thousand Pounds And on the th of  March  the first Stone of the Exchange was laid by the Mayor with great Ceremony with several Pieces of Gold and Silver Coin under it and this Inscription on the Stone  Regnante GEORGIO  II  Pio Felici Augusto Libertatis Rei Mercatoriae Domi Forisque Vindice primarium Lapidem hujusce Aedificii Suffragio Civium Aere publico extructi posuit  HENRICUS COMBE  Praetor A C  MDCCXL  That is  In the Reign of  GEORGE II  Pious Prosperous August Vindicator at Home and Abroad of Liberty and Trade  HENRY COMBE  Mayor placed the First Stone of this Structure erected by the Votes of the Citizens and at the publick Expence  A D  This Edifice when finish'd will be one of the completest of its Kind in  Europe    The old Library in  Kingstreet  is rebuilding in a very handsome Manner as is also  MerchantTaylorsHall  in  Broadstreet  a Freestone Building near Feet long and Breadth proportionable  From this City I had Thoughts of coasting the Marshes or Border of  Wales  especially  SouthWales  by tracing the Rivers  Wye  and  Lug  in  Monmouth  and  Herefordshire  but chang'd my Mind on Occasion of the Danger of the Ferries over the  Severn  In the mean time I resolv'd to follow the Course of this famous River by which I should necessarily see the richest most fertile and most agreeable Part of  England  the Banks of the  Thames  only excepted  From  Bristol  West you enter the County of  Gloucester  and keeping the  Avon  in View you see  KingRoad  where the Ships generally take their Departure as ours at  London  do from  Gravesend  and  HungRoad  and where they notify their Arrival as ours for  London  do in the  Downs  The one lies within the  Avon  the other in the  Severn Sea  Indeed great Part of  Bristol  is in the Bounds of  Gloucestershire  though it be a County of itself From hence going away a little Northwest we come to the  Pill  a convenient Road for Shipping and where therefore they generally run back for  Ireland  or for  Wales  There is also a little farther an ugly dangerous and very inconvenient Ferry over the  Severn  to the Mouth of  Wye  namely at  Aust  which I shall mention again presently  As we turn  North  towards  Gloucester  we lose the Sight of the  Avon  and in about two Miles exchange it for an open View of the  Severn Sea  which you see on the West Side and which seems as broad as the Ocean there except that you see two small Islands in it and that looking N W you discern plainly the Coast of  SouthWales  and particularly a little nearer hand the Shore of  Monmouthshire  Then as you go on the Shores begin to draw towards one another and the Coasts to lie parallel so that the  Severn  appears to be a plain River or an  Aestuarium  somewhat like the  Humber  or as the  Thames  is at the  Nore  being to and Miles over and is indeed a most raging and furious kind of Sea This is occasion'd by those violent Tides call'd the  Bore  which flow here sometimes or Feet at once rolling forward like a mighty Wave so that the Stern of a Vessel shall on a sudden be lifted up or Feet upon the Water when the Head of it is fast aground  After Coasting the Shore about Miles farther the Road being by the low Salt Marshes kept at a Distance from the River we came to  Aust  Ferry from a little dirty Village call'd  Aust  near which you come to take Boat  This Ferry lands you at  Beachly  in  Monmouthshire  so that on the Outside it is call'd  Aust Passage  and on the other Side  Beachly Passage  From whence you go by Land two little Miles to  Chepstow  a large Port Town on the River  Wye  But of that Part I shall say more in its Place  Here is a good neat Chapel with an high Tower at the Westend adorned with Pinacles  This Place is memorable from a Circumstance in the Reign of King  Edw  I who being here invited  Lewellin  Prince of  Wales  who was on the other Side to come over and confer with him and settle some Matters in Dispute between them but the  Prince refused and the King thereupon cross'd over to him who in a Rapture of Generosity leap'd into the Water to receive the King in his Boat telling him His Humility had conquer'd his Pride and his Wisdom triumphed over his Folly  When we came to  Aust  the hither Side of the  Passage  the Sea was so broad the Fame of the  Bore  of the Tide so formidable the Wind also made the Water so rough and which was worse the Boats to carry over both Man and Horse appear'd so very mean that in short none of us car'd to venture so we came back and resolv'd to keep on the Road to  Gloucester    Thornbury  is a Market Town and hath a Customary Mayor and Aldermen and was given in the Conqueror's Time to the famous  FitzHammon  Here are the Foundations of a large Castle design'd but never finish'd by the Duke of  Buckingham  in King  Henry  VIII's Time Here is a spacious Church built Cathedralwise it has fine wide Ayles and Chancels with a high and beautiful Tower Here is a FreeSchool and small Almshouses  On the right lies  Wotton  a pretty Markettown governed by a Mayor elected annually at the CourtLeet 'Tis famous for its Cloathing Trade The Church which is a Vicarage is large and hath Two wide Ayles and an high handsome Tower adorned with Battlements and Pinacles There are in it divers Tombs Monuments and Inscriptions chiefly for the Family of  Berkley  Here is a Freeschool and some Charityhouses  Directly North of this Town lies  Dursley  a good Cloathing and Market Town governed by a Bailiff and Constables and has been formerly noted for sharp overreaching People from whence arose a Proverbial Saying of a sharp Man  He is a Man of  Dursley The Church is good hath Ayles and an handsome Spire  Turning Northwest we came to  Berkley  a noted Town so called from  Berk  a Beech and  Leas  Pasture It is the largest Parish in the County and consists of rich Meadowgrounds and above Parishes depend on this Manor for which a Feefarm Rent was paid in King  Henry  II's Time of  l    s    d  which shews the vast Extent and Value of this Estate It belongs to the present Earl of  Berkley  who is also Baron of  Dursley  Adjoining to this Town is the strong Castle of  Berkley  a magnificent tho' antique Building and the antient Seat of this noble Family from whence it derives its Name as well as Title ever since the Time of King  Henry  II who gave it to  Robert Fitzharding  who assumed the Name of  Berkley  and from whom the present Earl is lineally descended King  Edw  II of  England  as all our learned Writers agree was murder'd in this Castle as King  Richard  II was in that of  Pontefract  in  Yorkshire  but I refer to our Histories for these horrid Facts They shew the Apartments where they say that King was kept a Prisoner but they do not admit that he was kill'd there The Place is rather antient than pleasant or healthful lying low and near the Water Here is a large spacious Church with an Ayle on each Side and a Chapel adjoining which is the Burialplace of the Family a neat Vestry and a strong high Tower  On the Right of the Road is  Stanley  a little Markettown where was formerly a Priory the Ruins whereof appear still The Church is built in the Form of a Cross with a Tower in the middle  A great Improvement has been lately made in these Parts for the Earl of  Berkley  has just finished a great Bulwark at  Frampton  upon  Severn  near this Place called  HockCrib  the Design of which is to inforce the River  Severn  by  Art'sPoint  into its former Chanel It is said his Lordship intends to  build another four Miles below the former by which he will undoubtedly gain a large Tract of Land contiguous to what is call'd the  New Grounds  inferior to none in  England  for the Richness of its Soil  From hence we saw across the River the antient Forest of  Dean  which once contained Acres of Land being Twenty Miles long and so full of Wood that it was very dangerous to travel through it Its Oak was famous for Shipping the Glory of our own and so much the Envy of other Nations that the famous  Spanish Armada  had it in special Charge to burn it The great Number of Iron Forges near it has greatly lessened tho' not consum'd the Wood which is still preserved with great Care It is subject to ForestLaws and the IronMiners have here a Court also  From hence to  Gloucester  we see nothing considerable but a most fertile rich Country and a fine River but narrower as you go Northward till a little before we come to  Gloucester  it ceases to be navigable by Ships of Burden but continues to be so by large Barges above an hundred Miles farther not reckoning the Turnings and Windings of the River besides that it receives several large and navigable Rivers into it  Gloucester  call'd by the  Britons Caerglow  i e  Fine City  and in Imitation of it  Glevum  by the  Romans  abounds much with Crosses and Statues of the Kings of  England  and has an handsome Prospect of Steeples some without a Church for in the late Civil Wars when it held out vigorously against King  Charles  I and was then very strong it suffer'd much for its Eleven Churches were then reduced to Five and all its Walls and Works were demolished The City is still tolerably built and here is a large Stone Bridge over the  Severn  the first next the Sea Here are several Markethouses supported with Pillars one a very old one of Stone in  Gothick  Architecture  antient and uncommon now turn'd into a Cistern for Water  The old Proverb  As sure as God's at  Gloucester certainly alluded to the vast Number of Churches and religious Foundations here for you can scarce walk past Doors but somewhat of that sort occurs  The Cathedral is an old venerable Pile The Western Part is old and mean but from the Tower which is very handsome you have a most glorious Prospect Eastward thro' the Choir finely vaulted at top and the Ladies Chapel to the East Window which is very magnificent On the Northside lies that unfortunate King  Edw  II in an Alabaster Tomb and out of the Abundance of pious Offerings to his Remains the Religious built this Choir and the Votaries to his Shrine for some time after his Death could hardly find Room in the Town So changeable are the Tempers of Men and so little a Space is requir'd to dispose the Minds of the fluctuating Many to  Hosannah  or  Crucify  Before the High Altar in the Middle of the Church lies the equally unfortunate Prince  Robert  eldest Son of the Conqueror after a miserable Life for many Years before his Death But his Monument remains and his Bones are at Rest which is more than can be said of the Monument of his younger Brother King  Henry  I who as the second Brother  William Rufus  had done robbed him of his Right and no Traces of his Monument are left at  ReadingAbbey  where he was bury'd with his Queen He lies in a wooden Tomb with his Coat of Arms painted and upon it his Effigies in  Irish  Oak crosslegg'd like a  Jerusalem  Knight The famous  Strongbow  who subdued  Ireland  lies buried in the Chapterhouse  The Cloysters in this Cathedral are exquisitely beautiful in the Style of the Chapel of  King'sCollege Cambridge  There are large Remains in the City  of Abbeys of Black and White Friers A Mile or two distant is  Robin Hood  's Hill as it is called which affords now a pleasant Walk for the Citizens and from which they are attempting to supply the City with Water which it much wants By this City the  Rickning  Way runs from the  Severn  's Mouth into  Yorkshire    The Inhabitants boast much of the Antiquity of their first Cathedral which they pretend had Bishops and Preachers here  Anno  The  first  Cathedral we say for it has been as reported thrice destroy'd by Fire  William the Conqueror  gave this City and Castle to the famous  Robert FitzHammon  afterwards Lord of  Glamorgan Edol  one of the  British  Nobles who attended King  Vortigern  to the Congress appointed by  Hengist  was Earl of this Place He was a Man of great personal Strength and seeing the  Saxons  drawing forth their conceal'd Weapons he disarm'd one of them and fought valiantly but being overpower'd by Numbers he escap'd to this City after having kill'd  Saxons  with his own Hands Afterwards in a Battle fought against the  Saxons  near the River  Don  he fix'd his Eye upon  Hengist  and never quitted him till he took him Prisoner and struck off his Head  In the little Isle of  Alney  near this Town the famous single Combat was fought between  Edmund Ironside  and  Canute  the  Dane  for the whole Kingdom in Sight of both their Armies  The City is governed by a Mayor Aldermen and Commoncouncilmen It has also an HighSteward who is usually a Nobleman and a Recorder They are allow'd the highest Marks of magistratical Honour Scarlet Gowns the Sword and Cap of Maintenance and Sergeants at Mace Here are Companies the Masters whereof attend the Mayor on all publick Occasions in their Gowns  and with Streamers It has a large Quay and Wharf on the River for Trade and a Customhouse Here is also a Townhall for the Assizes and publick Business which they call the  Boothhall  and great Part of the Castle is still standing  The first Protestant Bishop of this Church was that truly Reverend and Religious Divine Dr  John Hooper  who was burnt to Death in the Cemetery of his own Cathedral in the Reign of Queen  Mary    The Whisperingplace in this Cathedral formerly pass'd for a kind of Wonder among the Vulgar but since Experience has taught the easilycomprehended Reason of the Thing and there is now the like in the Church of  St Paul London    Here is great Provision for the Poor by Hospitals particularly  Bartholomew  's Hospital maintains Men and Women to whom belong a Minister Physician and Surgeon And Sir  Thomas Rich  Bart a Native of this Place gave  l  by Will for a  BlueCoat  Hospital wherein are educated poor Boys and poor Men and Women are maintain'd and cloath'd annually Besides these and three more there are many Benefactions to encourage young Tradesmen and place out Boys Apprentices And they have lately erected an Infirmary here after the laudable Example of that of  Winchester  c  At  Lassington  near  Gloucester  are found certain Stones about the Breadth of a Silver Peny and Thickness of a Halfcrown called  Astroites  or Starstones being finepointed like a Star and flat They are of a greyish Colour and the flat Sides are naturally finely engraven as it were But I have taken Notice of these before  From  Gloucester  we kept Eastward and soon came to  Cheltenham  a Markettown where is still a pretty good Trade carried on in Malt but not so considerable as formerly Here is a good Church in  the Form of a Cross with Ayles on each Side and a Spire rising in the Middle noted for a good Ring of Bells But what is more remarkable is that the Minister is to be nominated by and must be a Fellow of  JesusCollege Oxon  tho' the Vicarage is but  l  a Year but approv'd of by the Earl of  Gainsborough  and he can't hold it more than six Years Here is a Freeschool an Hospital and some other Charities  The Mineral Waters lately discovered at  Cheltenham  which are of the  Scarborough  Kind are what will make this Place still more and more remarkable and frequented An eminent Physician has obliged me with the following Account of their Nature and Qualities  These Waters he observes were first found out by the Flocks of all the neighbouring Pigeons going constantly thither to provoke their Appetites as well as to quench the uncommon Thirst of these salacious hot Birds I have been informed says he by a Physician of Credit and Experience who had made all the common Trials on them and observed their Effects on many Persons of various Constitutions and in different Distempers who had drank them That on Evaporation they were found to contain in a Gallon eight Drachms of a nitrous Salt with two Drachms of an alcalious Earth That they were compounded of a large Quantity of Nitre to which they owed their purgative Virtue a light Sulphur which the fetid Dejections manifested and a volatile Steel discoverable by a transparent blue Colour when mix'd with an Infusion of Nutgalls Alcalious Spirits have no Effect on them but they ferment with Acids He further adds That there might be found some other Materials in their Composition perhaps if more minutely examined and tortured but that these mentioned Principles were evident and incontestable and were sufficient to account  for all their Effects and Operation the others if there be any being of little Efficacy In the Operation they empty the Bowels according to their Dose but gently mildly and easily without Sickness Nausea Gripes or causing great Lowness far beyond any artificial Purges whatsoever They give a good Appetite an easy Digestion and quiet Nights in all Nephritick and Gouty Cases when not under the Fit in all Rheumatick Scrophulous Scorbutic or Leprous Cases but especially in Spermatic Urinary or Haemorrhoidal Cases he thinks them sovereign and not to be match'd In a Word in all Inflammatory Cases of whatever Kind and whatever Part he thinks them one of the most salutary Means which can be used Those of pretty strong Nerves and firm Constitutions bear them with high Spirits great Pleasure and Profit but they do not at all suit with those of weak Nerves Paralytick Hypochondriack or Hysterick Disorders or those who are subject to any kind of Fits Cramps or Convulsions they ruffle such too much as generally all Purgatives do He thinks they have a great Affinity to the  Scarborough  Waters and might do great Cures in most Chronical Distempers if Exercise and a proper Regimen were directed with them  Following the Road towards  Warwick  directly we arriv'd at  Winchcomb  a small Markettown situate in a Bottom in the midst of good Pasture and Arable Lands but of no great Account The Church is a good Building hath two Ayles a large Chancel and a lofty Tower adorn'd with Battlements and Pinacles It is remarkable that it is a Curacy worth no more than  l  a Year tho' the Impropriation is worth  l  annually Here was formerly a very rich Abbey whereof the Abbot was Mitred founded by  Offa  King of  Mercia    Here we turned from the Road and struck NW to  Tewksbury  encompassed with Rivers the  Avon  and  Carran  on the N the  Severn  on the W and the  Swyliate  on the S 'Tis govern'd by Bailiffs and Burgesses and its Neighbourhood to  CotswoldDowns  makes the Cloathing Trade flourish here It is a large and very populous Town situate upon the  Warwickshire  River  Avon  so call'd to distinguish it from the  Bristol Avon  and others The Town was long famous for its Mustardballs as also for a great Manufacture of Stockens as are also  Campden  in this County and  Pershore  in  Worcestershire    The great old Church at  Tewksbury  may be called one of the largest Churches in  England  that is not Collegiate or Cathedral It is very high has two spacious Ayles a stately Tower and a large Chancel The CommunionTable is one intire Marble Stone near Feet long and and ½ broad  The Town is famous for the decisive Battle fought between the Houses of  Lancaster  and  York  in the Reign of King  Edward  IV of the latter House who was Conqueror  As  Tewksbury  lies on the Borders of  Worcestershire  we soon entered that County and came to  Upton  an antient MarketTown of some Note upon the  Severn  over which it has a good Bridge  Roman  Coins are frequently dug up here  On the Left Westward of this Town and which parts this County from that of  Hereford  are  Malvern  Hills which consist of large Mountains prodigiously high and lofty gradually rising one above another for about Miles together On these Hills are two Villages call'd  Great Malvern  and  Little Malvern  at the Distance of about Two Miles from each other each having had formerly an Abbey of  Benedictines  the last lying in a dismal Cavity between the Hills On the very Top of these Hills may be seen the Ruins of a prodigious Ditch which  Gilbert  Earl of  Gloucester  dug to separate his Possessions  from those of the Church of  Hereford  On these Hills are Medicinal Springs called  Holy Wells  one is good for the Eyes and putrid fetid Livers and the other for Cancers  From  Upton  we travelled Northeast and came to  Pershore  which lies on the lower  London  Road to  Worcester  it is said to be so called from the great Number of Peartrees which thrive plentifully here It is a pleasant MarketTown lying on the  Avon  and famous for the Stocken Trade as I have mentioned before  Eastward of this Town stands  Evesham  situate on a gentle Ascent from the same River over which it hath a Bridge of stately Arches It is an antient Mayortown and has the Privilege to try Felons It is memorable for the decisive Battle wherein  Simon Montfort  and the Barons were defeated by Prince  Edward  afterwards King  Edward  I who thereby released his Father out of Captivity Here are Churches with small Spire Steeples but neither of them has any Bells which have been removed to a famous Tower built by Abbot  Litchfield  and stands near these Churches  All around this Town lies that fruitful and plentiful Country call'd from this Place  The Vale of Evesham  which runs all along the Banks of the  Avon  from  Tewksbury  to  Pershore  and to  Stratford  upon  Avon  in the South Part of  Warwickshire  which River is so far navigable  The Parish Church of  Stratford  is very old In it we saw the Monument of the inimitable  Shakespeare  whose Dramatick Performances set him at the Head of the  British  Theatre and will make him renown'd to the End of Time His Busto is in the Wall on the Northside of the Church and a flat Gravestone covers the Body in the Ayle just under him on which Gravestone these Lines are written  Good Friend for Jesus' sake forbear  To move the Dust that resteth here  Blest be the Man that spares these Stones  And curst be he that moves my Bones  Over the  Avon  at  Stratford  is built a fair Stone Bridge of Arches with a long Causeway at the West End of it wall'd on both Sides  The Navigation of this River  Avon  is an exceeding Advantage to all this Part of the Country and also to the Commerce of the City of  Bristol  For by this River they drive a very great Trade for Sugar Oil Wine Tobacco Iron Lead and in a Word all heavy Goods which are usually carried by Water almost as far as  Warwick  and in Return the Corn and especially Cheese are carried back from  Gloucestershire  and  Warwickshire  to  Bristol  for  Gloucester  Cheese is excellent of the kind and this County drives a great Trade in it  This Vale extending itself in  Warwickshire  and under the Ridge of little Mountains call'd  Edgehill  is there call'd the Vale of  Redhorse  All the Grounds put together make a most pleasant Corn Country especially remarkable for the Goodness of the Air and Fertility of the Soil  Not far from  Stretford  on the Borders of this County of  Worcester  is  Alcester  a Markettown much frequented by Dealers in Corn it is of great Antiquity as appears by old Foundations of Buildings made of  Roman  Brick and Gold Silver and Brass Coins found here The old  Roman  Way called  Ikenildstreet  passes thro' the Town  Gloucestershire  must not be passed over without some Account of another pleasant and fruitful Vale which crosses part of the Country from East to West on that Side of the  Cotswold  and which is called  Stroudwater  famous not only for the finest Cloths but for dying those Cloths of the beautifulest  Scarlets and other grand Colours that are anywhere in  England  perhaps in any Part of the World Here I saw Two Pieces of Broadcloth made one Scarlet the other Crimson in Grain which were sent as Presents the one to the late King  George  whilst Elector and the other to his present Majesty which were very graciously accepted The Cloth was valued at  s per  Yard and was well worth it for nothing so rich of that kind had been ever made in  England  before as I was informed  The Clothiers lie all along the Banks of this River for near Miles and in the Town of  Stroud  which lies in the middle of it as also at  Paynswick  which I have mentioned before The River makes its Way to the  Severn  about Five Miles below  Gloucester    From  Tewksbury  North it is Miles to  Worcester  along the Banks of the  Severn  where I was wonderfully delighted with the  Hedgerows  lin'd all the Way with Apple and Peartrees full of Fruit and those so common that any Passengers as they travel the Road may gather and eat what they please Here also as well as in  Gloucestershire  you meet with Cyder in the Publickhouses sold as Beer and Ale is in other Parts of  England  and as cheap  We saw at a Distance in a most agreeable Situation the Seat of Sir  Herbert Perrot Pakington  a Baronet of a very antient Family  On the other Side of the  Severn  at  Whitleycourt  five Miles from  Bewdly  and seven from  Worcester  the Lord  Foley  has a Seat situate in a large Park  Worcester  the  Branonium  of the  Romans  seems to have been built by them to curb the  Silures  on the other Side of the  Severn  and in Imitation of the  Roman  Name the  Britons  called it  Caer Wrangon  It is situate in a Valley on the  Severn  which tho' generally rapid elsewhere glides on here very gently It is a large populous antient wellbuilt  City and the best paved in  England  The  Foregatestreet  is the most regular and beautiful that can be seen out of  London  The  Guildhall  is a very fine Building but the Statues on the Outside disgrace it  There is a good old Stone Bridge over the  Severn  which stands exceeding high from the Surface of the Water and has a Tower upon it said to be built by the  Romans  But as the Stream of the  Severn  is contracted here by the Buildings on either Side there is evident Occasion sometimes for the Height of the Bridge the Waters rising to an incredible Degree in the Wintertime  The Commandery here formerly belonging to  St John's of Jerusalem  is now possessed by Mr  Wylde  and is a fine old House of Timber in the Form of a Court The Hall roof'd with  Irish  Oak makes one Side of it built for the Reception of Pilgrims The Windows are adorn'd with Imagery and Coats Armorial of stained Glass It stands just without the South Gate of the City in the  London  Road where the Heat of the famous Battle happen'd between King  Charles  II and  Oliver Cromwell  and they frequently find Bones of the Slain on digging in the Garden Above in the Park is to be seen a great Work of Four Bastions called  the Royal Mount  whence a  Vallum  and Ditch run both ways to incompass this Side of the City Here 'tis probable the Storm began when the Royalists were driven back into the City with great Slaughter and the King escaped being made a Prisoner in the narrow Street at this Gate by a loaded Cart of Hay purposely overthrown which gave him time to retire at the opposite Gate to  Boscobel  or  White Lady's    A Mile and half above the South Gate on the Top of the Hall is the celebrated  Perrywood  where  Cromwell  's Army lay and which affords a fine Prospect over the County  The Cathedral is an antient Building The Body of the Church makes no extraordinary Appearance on the Outside The Tower is low without any Spire only four very small Pinacles on the Corners and yet it has some little Beauty in it more than the Church itself The upper Part has some Images in it but decay'd by Time In it is bury'd the restless King  John  not where now his Monument stands which is in the Choir before the high Altar but under a little Stone before the Altar of the Eastermost Wall of the Church On each Side of him on the Ground lie the Effigies of the two Bishops his chief Saints  Wolston  and  Oswald  from whose Neighbourhood he hoped to be safe The Image of the King probably lay here also upon the Ground now elevated upon a Tomb in the said Choir  On the South Side of the High Altar is a large and handsome Stone Chapel over the Monument of Prince  Arthur  eldest Son of  Henry  VII who died at  Ludlow  as his Tombstone specifies  Anno  and whose Relict  Catharine  Infanta of  Spain  his Brother  Henry  VIII marrying after Years Wedlock was divorced from to make way for  Anna Bolen  The Choir of this Chapel is exquisite Workmanship but suffered much in the late Civil Wars  Here is also among other noted Monuments one for that famous Countess of  Salisbury  who dancing before  Edward  III in his great Hall at  Windsor  dropt her Garter which the King taking up honoured it so much as the idle Story goes as to make it the denominating Ensign of  The most Noble Order of the Garter  but this I have refuted under my Account of  Windsor  Tho' that the Countess did drop her Garter is Fact and the King might gallantly to silence the Jests and Railleries of the Court wear it during the Entertainment instead of his Garter of the Order But the Motto was given  in Allusion to the Order of Knighthood and not of the Garter  The Monument is very fine and there is this remarkable in it that there are several Angels cut in Stone about it strewing Garters over the Tomb  There are several other antient Monuments in this Church which I have not Room to mention  The Cloisters are very perfect and the Chapterhouse is large supported as to its arched Roof by one umbilical Pillar 'Tis now become a Library is well furnish'd and has many good antient MSS  There is a large old Gatehouse standing and near it the Castle with a very high artificial Mount or Keep nigh the River  The Bridge I have mention'd has six Arches and the Banks of the  Severn  look very beautiful on each Side being inriched with pleasant Meadows  This City is governed by a Mayor and Aldermen It has Two Chamberlains a Recorder a Townclerk Two Coroners a Swordbearer Four Sergeants at Mace and a Sheriff being like  Gloucester  a County of itself divided into Seven Wards in which are Twelve Parish Churches  The Inhabitants are generally esteem'd rich being full of Business occasion'd chiefly by the Cloathingtrade of which the City and the Country round carries on a great Share as well for the  Turkey  as the Home Trade The Number of Hands which it imploys in this Town and adjoin  ng Villages in Spinning Carding Rowing Fulling Weaving  c  is almost incredible One Part of the Town is wholly possessed by  Welsh  People who speak their own Language and are imploy'd in this Manufacture So that this City which was formerly so great a Grievance to the great ones of that Principality now administers Subsistence to a vast Number of the meaner ones  It is adorn'd by a capacious and beautiful Structure called  the Publick Workhouse  in which Children of both Sexes are trained up to the Knowlege of Trade and the Practice of Religion and Virtue by whose Labour also the Aged and Decrepid are supported This laudable Institution continued several Years to the great Benefit of the City till at last the Guardians of it having contracted a Debt of upwards of  l  they returned the Poor back to their respective Parishes and the whole Charity being frustrated and put an End to the Corporation let out the Building for a Hopmarket Warehouses  c  to pay the incurr'd Debt either Principal or Interest  Hereupon their worthy Representative  Samuel Sandys    Esq  and other Gentlemen procured an Act of Parliament for restoring it to its first laudable End which Act took place from  June  and will be a lasting Monument to the Honour of the disinterested and publickspirited Gentleman to whose unwearied Application and inflexible Resolution it was owing for it must be observed that alienated Charities are some of the hardest things in the World to be restored  Opposite to this Workhouse  Robert Berkley  of  Spetchley    Esq  erected a fine Hospital for Twelve poor Men and gave  l  to build it and  l  to endow it  Here are besides Three Grammarschools and Seven Almshouses all liberally indow'd  St Nicolas  Church in this City has been lately rebuilt and is a neat and commodious Edifice  And the Church of  Allsaints  in this Town being in so ruinous a Condition that Part of it actually fell down and the rest being ready to fall an Act passed Sess for taking down and rebuilding the same  From  Worcester  I made some Excursions to visit the Towns and Country Northward and first came  to  Droitwych  a corporate Bailiwicktown which has Four Churches and is pretty wealthy 'Tis famous for excellent White Salt which is made here from the Summer to the Winter Solstice no  but they may make Salt all the Year long but they fear to overstock the Market It appears by  Doomsdaybook  they made Salt here before the Conquest The Salt Springs are very good and productive of Plenty of Brine and the Town lies on the River  Salwarp    Proceeding directly on in the Road we arrived at  Broomsgrove  a large Bailiwicktown likewise on the River  Salwarp  where the Clothingtrade is pretty briskly carried on It is the Centre of Four Roads one leads to  Coventry  and  Leicester  another to  Warwick  and so to  London  a Third to  Worcester  and the Fourth to  Shrewsbury    Between  Worcester  and  Spetchley  was  St Oswald  's Hospital demolished in the Reign of Queen  Elizabeth  But Dr  Fell  Bishop of  Oxford  after the Restoration recover'd much of the Possessions and erected a fair and large Hospital which comfortably maintains Twelve poor Men  Kidderminster  is a Town in this County of  Worcester  very considerable for its Woollen Trade particularly the Weaving of what they call Lindseywoolsey in which the Inhabitants are almost wholly imploy'd It is a large but yet compact and populous Town situated on the  Stour  and govern'd by a Bailiff Twelve Capital Burgesses Twentyfive Commoncouncilmen  c  In its Church is a crosslegg'd Monument of Sir  Thomas Acton    Stourbridge  is also situate upon the River  Stour  over which it has a very good Bridge whence its Name This Town deals greatly in Glass Manufacture of all Sorts and also in Iron Works of all Sorts and is vastly improved of late Years both in Houses and Inhabitants At  Swinford  near  Stourbridge  is a noble Hospital for Sixty Boys erected by  the First Founder of the noble Family of  Foley  which deserves the Attention of a Traveller and the Praise of all Men At  Stourbridge  also fine Stone Pots are made for Glassmakers to melt their Metal in also Crucibles  c  the Clay of which these Things are made being almost peculiar to the Place  Birmingham  is a very populous Town and full of Iron Manufactories especially of the smaller Sorts in which the Inhabitants so greatly excel that their Works are carried to all Parts of the World in great Quantities The Town is of late Years greatly improved and inlarged by many new Buildings both publick and private particularly a new Church built by virtue of an Act of Parliament passed in the th of Queen  Anne  which is dedicated to St  Philip  This Town is in  Warwickshire  on the Borders of this County situated on the Side of a Hill and has a most plentiful Market  A little below  Worcester  Westward the  Severn  receives a River of a long deep Course which comes from  Shropshire  called the  Teme  on which stands a small Markettown called  Tenbury  but of little Note I passed this River formerly in my Way to  Ludlow  at  Broadway  a little Village but now I went by the Way of  Bewdley  on the Side of  Shropshire    In this Course we saw Two fine Seats not very far from the  Severn viz  the Lord  Foley  's and the Earl of  Bradford  's as we did before a most delicious House belonging to the Lord  Conway  Indeed this Part of the County and all the County of  Salop  is filled with fine Seats of the Nobility and Gentry which we have not Room to describe  Bewdley  or  Beaulieu  i e  fine Place  said to be so called from its pleasant and delightful Situation upon the Side of a Hill declining to the  Severn  is a small Bailiff Markettown well supplied with Corn Malt Leather and Caps which the  Dutch  Seamen buy  called  Monmouth Caps  and noted for the Palace which King  Henry  VII built here for his Son Prince  Arthur  called  Tickenhall  It had a very fine Park about it which with the House was destroy'd by the furious Enthusiasts in the Civil War  A Mile off is  Ribsford  the Seat of Lord  Herbert  of  Cherbury  pleasantly surrounded with Woods Here is a good Picture of  William  the First Earl of  Pembroke    The Ends of the Hills towards the River are generally Rocks and  Blackstonhill  has an Hermitage cut out of it with a Chapel and several Apartments Near it is a pretty Rock upon the Edge of the Water covered with Oaks and many curious Plants  Not far from  Cherbury  Park is the Parish of  Roch  where the famous  Augustine  's Oak stood so called from a Conference held under it by  Augustine  and the  British  Bishops about the Celebration of  Easter  and preaching God's Word and administring Baptism after the Rites of the Church of  Rome  which the  British  Bishops refused  I thought once to have returned to  Worcester  and so proceeded to  Herefordshire  and down to  Monmouth  and so round the Coast of  Wales  But being desirous to take in first the South Part of  Shropshire  I followed the  Severn  up North and came to  Bridgenorth  a very antient and noted Town said to be built by Queen  Aethelfleda  in the Time of the Heptarchy it consists of Two Towns the High and the Low which are separated by the  Severn  but united by a fair Stone Bridge of Seven Arches which hath a Gate and Gatehouse The Situation is pleasant the Air healthy the Prospect delightful and commodious for Trade It hath been fortified with Walls and a Castle which are now in Ruins and the Area in the last is converted to a fine Bowlinggreen The Streets are many and well paved It is governed by a Bailiff Twentyfour Aldermen and other  inferior Officers It is noted for good Gunmakers and its Stocken Manufacture It has a wellreplenished Market and Five Fairs annually Two whereof hold Three Days which are much resorted to and abound with Horses Black Cattle Sheep Butter Cheese Bacon Linen Cloth and Hops in great Plenty Here are Two Churches and tho' the Parishes are large and the Town very populous are very indifferently indowed and so is the Freeschool There is a hollow Way cut thro' the Rock leading from the high Town to the Bridge of the Depth of Feet in some Parts of it and likewise many Vaults and Dwellings are hewn out of the Rock  From hence we advanced in the direct Road to  Shrewsbury  and came to  Great Wenlock  an antient incorporated Town governed by a Bailiff and Burgesses but noted for nothing extraordinary  Leaving  Shrewsbury  for my Observation at my Return from  Wales  thro'  Cheshire  we turn'd short here and fell down Southward to  Ludlow  famed more for its Beauty than Antiquity for it seems the Castle which was so truly magnificent was built by  Roger de Montgomery  in the  Conqueror  's Time  But before I speak more of this Castle I shall observe that on the Extremity of this County in a kind of Promontory which runs in between  Montgomeryshire  and  Radnorshire  upon the  Clun  lies  Bishops Castle  a small Market Bailiwick Town and not very far from it just at the Entrance into  Montgomeryshire  is a noted Place called  Bishops  ott  where is an Acre of Ground surrounded with an Intrenchment The  Clun  meets the  Teme  at  Ludlow  and both united run to  Clebury  a small Town on the Borders of  Worcestershire  where it falls as I mentioned before into the  Severn    The Castle of  Ludlow  shews plainly in its Decay what it was in its flourishing Estate it is the Palace of the Prince of  Wales  in Right of his Principality  Its Situation is indeed most beautiful there is a most spacious Plain or Lawn in its Front which formerly continued near Two Miles but much of it is now inclosed The Country round it is exceeding pleasant fertile populous and the Soil rich nothing can be added by Nature to make it a Place fit for a Royal Palace It is built in the Northwest Angle of the Town upon a Rock commanding a delightful Prospect Northward and on the West is shaded by a lofty Hill and washed by the River The Battlements are of great Height and Thickness with Towers at convenient Distances That Half which is within the Walls of the Town is secured with a deep Ditch the other is founded on a solid Rock A Chapel here has abundance of Coats of Arms upon the Panels as has the Hall together with Lances Spears Firelocks and old Armour  It will be no Wonder that this noble Castle is in the very Perfection of Decay when we acquaint our Readers that the present Inhabitants live upon the Sale of the antient Materials All the fine Courts the Royal Apartments Halls and Rooms of State lie open abandon'd and some of them falling down for since the Courts of the President and Marches are taken away here is nothing that requires the Attendance of any publick People so that Time the great Devourer of the Works of Men begins to eat into the very Stone Walls and to spread the Face of Ruin upon the whole Fabrick Over several of the Stabledoors are the Arms of Queen  Elizabeth  the Earls of  Pembroke  c  The Town of  Ludlow  is likewise fortify'd with Walls thro' which are Seven Gates It is wellbuilt and a Place of good Trade but to be sure it is not the better for the ruinous State of the Castle and the abolishing of the Court held there for the Marches It stands on the Edge of the two Counties  Shropshire  and  Worcestershire  but is itself in the first  On the Southside of the Town runs the  Teme  over which is a good Bridge The River has several Dams across it in the Nature of Cataracts whereby abundance of Mills are turn'd and great is the Roar of the superfluous Waters  Ludlow  has a very good Church with an handsome Tower and a pleasant Ring of Six Bells The Windows are full of painted Glass pretty intire  There are some old Monuments of the Lords Presidents  c  and an Inscription upon the North Wall of the Choir relating to Prince  Arthur  elder Brother to King  Henry  VIII who died here and in this Spot his Bowels were deposited It is said That his Heart was taken up some time ago in a leaden Box  In the Eastern Angle of the Choir is a Closet antiently called  The Godhouse  where the Priests secured their consecrated Utensils The Window is strongly barred on the Outside The Church is dedicated to St  Laurence  and in the Marketplace is a Cistern or Conduit on the Top of which is a long Stone Cross bearing a Niche in which is the Image of that Saint  West of the Church was a College now converted to a private House There was a rich Priory out of the Town on the North Side of which are but few Ruins to be seen except a small Church which formerly belonged to it The  Welsh  call this Town  Lye Twysoy  i e the  Prince's Court  Mr  Camden  calls the River  Teme  the  Tem'd  and another River which joins it just at this Town the  Corve  whence the rich flat Country below the Town is call'd  Corvesdale  It is governed by Two Bailiffs Twelve Aldermen a Recorder Twentyfive Commoncouncilmen and other inferior Officers and has the particular Privilege of trying and executing  Criminals It has an Almshouse for poor People  King  Henry  VIII establish'd here the Court of the President and Council of the Marches beforementioned and all Causes of  Nisi prius  or of Civil Right were try'd here before the Lord President and Council but this Court being grown a great Grievance to the Publick was intirely taken away by Act of Parliament in the first Year of King  William  and Queen  Mary    From  Ludlow  we took our Course still due South to  Lemster  or  Leominster  a large Markettown on the River  Lug  over which it hath several Bridges 'Tis governed by a Bailiff The Church which is very large has been in a manner rebuilt and is now very beautiful This Town is noted for its fine Wool and the best Wheat and consequently the finest Bread and also for the best Barley whence  Lemster Bread  and  Weobly Ale  are become a proverbial Saying  It is a Town of brisk Trade in Wool Hatmaking Leather  c  and lies in a Valley exceedingly luxuriant Three Rivers of a very swift Current go thro' the Town besides others very near The Inhabitants make great use of these by Mills and other Machinery in the various Branches of their Trade On the Northside of the Church was a considerable Priory Two Ayles of which belong now to the Church and Two others of more lightsome Work have been added The Mayor has a long black Rod to walk with tipt with Silver There are some poor Remains of the Priory chiefly a little Chapel which probably belong'd to the Prior's Family Underneath it runs a pretty Rivulet which us'd to grind his Corn now converted to a Fullingmill Near it are very large Ponds for Fish which used to furnish the Monks on fasting Days There was a fine Gatehouse pull'd  down not long ago near the  Ambry  or  Almery  Close where they gave their Scraps away to the Poor  Pembridge Weobly  and  Kyneton  lie Southwest of  Lemster  and form in their Situation a kind of Triangle They are all MarketTowns and the first is pretty considerable for the Cloathing Trade the second for Ale but the third for nothing that I know of  The County on our right as we came from  Ludlow  is very fruitful and pleasant and is called the Hundred of  Wigmore  from which the Earl of  Oxford  takes the Title of Baron Here we saw the two antient Castles of  Brampton Brian  and  Wigmore  both belonging to the late Earl's Grandfather Sir  Edward Harley Brampton  is a stately Pile but not kept in full Repair The Parks are fine and full of large Timber  We were now on the Borders of  Wales  properly so called for from the Windows of  BramptonCastle  you have a fair Prospect into the County of  Radnor  which is as it were under its Walls nay even this whole County of  Hereford  was a Part of  Wales  and so deem'd for many Ages The People of this County too boast that they were a Part of the antient  Silures  who for so many Ages withstood the  Roman  Arms and could never be intirely conquer'd They are a diligent and laborious People chiefly addicted to Husbandry and they boast that they have the finest Wool the best Hops and the richest Cyder in all  Britain  and possibly with some Reason for the Wool about  Leominster  and in the Hundred of  Wigmore  and the  Golden Vale  as it is call'd for its Richness on the Banks of the River  Dove  all in this County is as fine as any in  England  the  Southdown  Wool not excepted As for  Hops  they plant abundance all over this County and they are very good And for  Cyder  it is the common Drink of the County and is so very good and so cheap that  we never found fault though we could get no other Drink for Twenty Miles together Great Quantities of this Cyder are sent to  London  even by LandCarriage though so very remote which is an Evidence in its Favour beyond Contradiction  One would hardly expect so pleasant and fruitful a Country as this so near the barren Mountains of  Wales  but 'tis certain that not any of our Southern Counties the Neighbourhood of  London  excepted come up to the Fertility of this County  From  Lemster  it is Ten Miles to  Hereford  the chief City not of this County only but of all the Counties West of the  Severn  In the time of the late Civil Wars it was very strong and being well fortify'd and as well defended supported a tedious and very severe Siege for besides the Parliament's Forces who could never reduce it the  Scots  Army was call'd to the Work who lay before it till they laid above of their Bones there and at last it was rather surrendered by the fatal Issue of the War than by the Attack of the Besiegers  It had before this Six Parishchurches but Two of them were demolish'd at that time It has an Hospital liberally endow'd for poor People  The City of  Hereford  probably sprung from the Ruins of the  Roman Ariconium  now  Kenchester  three Miles off higher up the River  Wye  but not very near it which may be a Reason for its Decay  Kenchester  stands upon a little Brook call'd the  Ine  which thence encompassing the Walls of  Hereford  falls into the  Wye    Archenfield  seems to retain the Name of  Ariconium  Nothing remains of its Splendor but a Piece of a Temple probably with a Nich which is Five Feet high and Three broad within built of Brick Stone and indissoluble Mortar There are many large Foundations near it A very fine  Mosaick  Floor a few Years ago was found intire which was soon  torn to Pieces by the ignorant Countrypeople A Bath was here found by Sir  John Hoskyns  about Seven Feet square the Pipes of Lead intire those of Brick were a Foot long Three Inches square let artificially into one another over these I suppose was a Pavement  This as Dr  Stukeley  observes is an excellent Invention for heating a Room and might well be introduced among us in Wintertime  In another Place is a Hollow where burnt Wheat has been taken up All around the City you may easily trace the Walls some Stones being left everywhere tho' overgrown by Hedges and Timbertrees The Situation of the Place is a gentle Eminence of a squarish Form the Earth black and rich overgrown with Brambles Oaktrees full of Stones Foundations and Cavities where they have been digging and found many Coins  c  Colonel  Dantsey  has pav'd a Cellar with square Bricks dug up here The Earl of  Coningsby  has adorn'd the Floor of his Evidenceroom with them  This City is overlook'd and shelter'd towards the North with a prodigious Mountain of steep Ascent on the Top stands a vast Camp with Works altogeter inaccessible which is call'd  Credonhill  At the Summit you are presented with the most glorious and extensive Prospect as far as  St Michael's Mount  in  Monmouthshire  crown'd with Two Tops and of considerable Resort among Zealots of the  Romish  Persuasion who believe this holy Hill was sent hither by St  Patrick  out of  Ireland  and that it works Wonders in several Cases  On the other side is the vast Black Mountain which separates  Brecknockshire  from this County The Town underneath appears like a little Copse  Dinderhill  whereon is a  Roman  Camp stands on the contrary Bank of the  Wye    And upon the  Lug  are  Suttonwalls  another vast  Roman  Camp upon a Hill overlooking a beautiful Vale which was the regal Residence of the powerful King  Offa  but chiefly remarkable for the Murder of young King  Ethelbert  whom he allur'd thither under Pretext of courting his Daughter and who was buried in the neighbouring Church of  Marden  situate in a Marsh by the Riverside Hence his Body was afterwards convey'd to  Hereford  and enshrin'd but the particular Place cannot be found  In the North Wing of the Cathedral of  Hereford  is the Shrine where the Body of  Cantilupe  the great Miraclemonger in the West of  England  was deposited which Wing was built by himself and on the Wall his Picture is painted All round are the Marks of Hooks where the Banners Lamps Reliques and the like Presents were hung up And the Riches of this Place were doubtless very considerable for it is well guarded against the Assaults of Thieves The Shrine is of Stone carv'd round with Knights in Armour  The Church is very old and stately The Spire is not high but handsome and there is a fine Tower at the West End The Roof Ayles and Chapel have been added to the more antient Part by successive Bishops as also the Towers Cloisters  c  The Choir tho' plain is handsome and there is a very good Organ  The Chapterhouse which was very beautiful was destroy'd in the Civil Wars About Four Windows are left standing and the Springing of the Stone Arches between are of fine Ribwork which compos'd the Roof of that Sort of Architecture wherewith  King'scollegechapel  was built Two Windows were pull'd down by Bishop  Bisse  which he us'd in new fitting up the Episcopal Palace Under the Windows in every Compartiment was painted a King Bishop Saint Virgin or the like some  of which were distinct enough tho' so long expos'd to the Weather  Here are a great Number of Monuments of Bishops and many valuable Brasses and Tombs  Between the Cathedral and Palace is a most venerable Pile built and roof'd with Stone consisting of Two Chapels one above the other the upper dedicated to St  Magdalen  the lower which is some Steps underground to St  Catharine    The Castle was a noble Work built by one of the  Edwards  before the Conquest strongly wall'd and ditch'd There is a very lofty artificial Keep having a Well fac'd with good Stone and by the Side of the Ditch a Spring consecrated to St  Ethelbert  with an old Stone Arch  Without the Walls are the Ruins of  BlackFriers  Monastery and a pretty Stone Cross intire round which the Cloisters were originally built as now the Cloisters of the Cathedral inclose another such These Crosses were in the nature of a Pulpit whence a Monk preach'd to the People in the open Air as now practis'd in the Cloisters of some Colleges in the Universities once a Year  The neighbouring Hill call'd  Dynmaur  or  The great Hill  makes amends for the Tediousness of climbing it by the Pleasure we receive from its woody Crest and extensive Prospect  At the City of  Hereford  we could not but inquire into the Truth of the Story so famous that the Right Reverend Bishop  Gibson  has mention'd it in his Continuation of  Camden  of the removing the Two great Stones near  Sutton  which the People confirm'd to us The Story is thus  Between  Sutton  and  Hereford  in a common Meadow call'd the  Wergins  were plac'd Two large Stones for a Watermark one erected upright and the other laid athwart In the late Civil Wars about the Year they remov'd to about twelvescore  Paces Distance and nobody knew how which gave occasion to a vulgar Notion That they were carried thither by the Devil When they were set in their Places again one of them requir'd nine Yoke of Oxen to draw it  Lidbury  lies Eastward of  Hereford  near the South End of the  Malvern  Hills It is a fine wellbuilt Markettown situate in rich clayey Grounds and much inhabited by Clothiers Here is an Hospital for the Poor well indowed  Not far from  Lidbury  is  Colwal  near which upon the Waste as a Countryman was digging a Ditch about his Cottage he found a Crown or a Coronet of Gold with Gems set deep in it It was of a Size large enough to be drawn over the Arm with the Sleeve The Stones of it are said to have been so valuable as to be sold by a Jeweller for One thousand Five hundred Pounds  Hereford  tho' a large and populous City may yet be said to be old meanbuilt and very dirty lying low and on the Bank of the  Wye  which sometimes incommodes them very much by the violent Freshes that come down from the Mountains of  Wales  for all the Rivers of this County except the  DiffrinDoe  come out of  Wales    One thing remarkable which we must not omit is that the College still retains its Foundation Laws and the Residentiaries are oblig'd to Celibacy but otherwise they live a very happy easy and plentiful Life being furnish'd upon the Foot of the Foundation besides their Ecclesiastical Stipends  In the Beginning of the Year they began to pull down the old  Gothick  Chapel belonging to the Bishop's Palace at  Hereford  in order to erect a Pile in a politer Taste for the publick Service The demolish'd Chapel was said to be as old as the Conquest  Between  Leominster  and this City is another  HamptonCourt  the Seat of the late Earl of  Coningsby  That Lord was from an  Irish  Peer made an  English  one by his late Majesty King  George  I And having no Son his Daughter was created by the same Prince in the Lifetime of her Father Baroness and Viscountess  Coningsby  of  HamptonCourt  in order that her Descendants might be intitled to a Peerage She marry'd Sir  Michael Newton  Bart and Knight of the  Bath  This is a fine Seat built by  Henry Bolinbroke  Duke of  Lancaster  afterwards King  Henry  IV in the Form of a Castle situate in a Valley upon a rapid River under Coverture of  Dynmaur  The Gardens are very pleasant terminated by vast Woods covering all the sloping Side of the Hill There is a plentiful Supply of Water on all Sides of the House for Fountains Basins and Canals Within are excellent Pictures of the Earl's Ancestors and others by  Holben Dobson Vandyke  Sir  P Lully  c an Original of the Founder King  Henry  IV of Queen  Elizabeth  the Duchess of  Portsmouth  c  The Windows of the Chapel are well painted there are some Statues of the  Coningsbies    Here are two new Stone Staircases after a Geometrical Method The Recordroom is attop of a Tower arch'd with Stone pav'd with  Roman  Brick and has an Iron Door From the Top of the House goes a Staircase which they say has a subterraneous Conveyance into  Dynmaur  Wood  The Park is very fine Eight Miles in Circumference and contains about Head of Deer There are extensive Prospects on one Side reaching into  Wiltshire  on the other over the  Welsh  Mountains Lawns Groves Canals Hills and Plains There is a Pool Three Quarters of a Mile long very broad and included between Two great Woods The Dam which forms it and is made over a Valley cost  l  and was finish'd in a Fortnight by  Hands A new River is cut quite thro' the Park the Chanel of which for a long way together is hewn out of the Rock This serves to inrich vast Tracts of Lands which before were barren Here also are new Gardens and Canals laid out and new Plantations of Timber in proper Places  Warrens Decoys Sheepwalks Pastures for Cattle  c  supply the House with all Sorts of Conveniencies and Necessaries without having recourse to a Market  Westward of  Hereford  the  Golden Vale  beforementioned extends itself along the River  Dore  which runs thro' the midst of it and is call'd by the  Britons Duffrin Dore  it is call'd the  Golden Vale  from its pleasant Fertility in the Spring when it is cover'd over with a yellow Livery of Flowers It is encompassed with Hills which are crown'd with Woods  From  Hereford  keeping the Bank of  Wye  as near as we could we came to  Ross  a good old Town famous for Cyder a great Manufacture of Ironware and its Trade on the River  Wye    From hence we came at about Eight Miles more into  Monmouthshire  formerly a  Welsh  but now an  English  County and to the Town of  Monmouth  It is a Place of great Antiquity and is fair large and wellbuilt situate at the Conflux of the  Wye  and  Munnow  whence the Town has its Name it stands in the Angle where the Rivers join and has a Bridge over each River and a third over the River  Trothy  which comes in just below the other  This Town shews Marks of great Antiquity and by the Remains of Walls Lines Curtains and Bastions that it has been very strong and by its Situation that it may be made so again It is a Boroughtown govern'd by Two Bailiffs Commoncouncilmen and Townclerk It has a very considerable Cornmarket It was famed for the Strength of the  Castle in the Time of  William  I and is the Birthplace of our renown'd King  Henry  V Conqueror of  France  and likewise of one of our antient Historians  Jeoffry  of  Monmouth  a fabulous Writer At present 'tis not very flourishing yet it drives a considerable Trade with the City of  Bristol  by the Navigation of the  Wye    This River having receiv'd Two large Streams the  Munnow  and the  Trother  becomes a very noble River and with a deep Chanel and a full Current hurries away towards the Sea carrying also Vessels of a considerable Burden hereabouts  Near  Monmouth  the Duke of  Beaufort  has a fine Seat call'd  Troyhouse    Lower down upon the  Wye  in this Shire stands  Chepstow  the Seaport for all the Towns seated on this River and the  Lug  and where their Commerce seems to centre Hither Ships of good Burden may come up and the Tide runs with the same impetuous Current as at  Bristol  the Flood rising ordinarily from Six Fathom to Six and a half at  Chepstow  Bridge which is a noble one indeed built of Timber and no less than Feet high from the Surface of the Water when the Tide is out And that this was not a needless Height was evident in  January  when the Water rose at the Bridge upwards of Feet and very much damag'd it one Man lost above Head of Cattle which with other Damages it did there and in the adjacent Places were computed at or  l Chepstow  has a well frequented Market especially for Corn The Bridge as half of it is in  Gloucestershire  is maintained at the Expence of both Counties  Two Miles from this Town is the famous Passage over the  Severn  on this Side call'd  Bleachly  and on the other  Aust  as I have mention'd before Here  Offa's Dyke  begins and passing through  Radnorshire    extends itself up to  Flintshire  and so to the River  Dee  which parts  Wales  from  Cheshire    We turn'd Northwards and arrived at  Abergavenny  which is a large wellbuilt and wellinhabited Markettown situate at the Mouth of the  Gavenny  running into the  Usk  It carries on a considerable Trade in Flanels which the Country People manufacture at home and bring hither to sell It is a great Thoroughfare from the Western Parts of  Wales  to  Bristol  and  Bath  by  Chepstow  and to  Gloucester  by  Monmouth  and so crossing the River thro'  Colford  and the Forest of  Dean    The Fuel in this County is Pitcoal and is very cheap insomuch that they sell a Horseload for Twopence at the Pitmouth and 'tis common in the meanest Cot to see a good Fire  Great Quantities of Corn are exported out of this County and 'tis frequent that the  Bristol  Merchants send their Ships hither to load for  Portugal  and other foreign Countries And indeed it is noted for producing as good Wheat and other Grain as any County in the Kingdom and yet it is very surpriseing that Lands here never sell for more than or Years Purchace The current Language of the County is  Welsh  among the Vulgar but the Gentlemen speak  English  generally  As I am now just upon entering  Wales  I will conclude this Letter with assuring you that I am  SIR  Yours c  LETTER VI CONTAINING A Description of the greatest Part of the Principality of  Wales    SIR  _I Thought I should not pay the Principality the Respect it so well deserves if I did not begin a Letter with the Description of it it being the Country of that brave People who had an original Right to the whole Island and made so noble a Stand in Defence of their Liberties and Independency and at last rather than submit to a foreign Yoke chose to be free in this remote and inaccessible Part of it  The two first Counties which border West upon  Monmouthshire  are  Brecknock  and  Glamorgan  and are very mountainous on the East Side which gives a Traveller a terrible Apprehension of the Country he is this way entering into and an Expectation of meeting with nothing that is agreeable but he is not long before he is undeceived and finds the Reward of his Trouble In that Part of  Monmouthshire  which joins the Two Counties begins the rising of  the Hills  KyrtonBeacon Tumberlow Blorench Penvail  and  Skirridan  are some of the Names of these horrid Mountains and are all in this Shire and I could not but fansy myself in View of  Mount Brennus LittleBarnard  and  GreatBarnard  among the  Alps    We now entered  South Wales  which contains the Shires of  Glamorgan Brecknock Radnor Caermarthen Pembroke  and  Cardigan    Brecknockshire  is a mere inland County as  Radnor  is the  English  jestingly and I think not very improperly call it  Breakneckshire  'tis mountainous to an Extremity except on the Side of  Radnor  where it is something more low and level It is well watered by the  Wye  and the  Uske  two Rivers mention'd before Upon the latter stands the Town of  Brecknock  the Capital of the County wellbuilt and the Assizes are kept at it It is very antient and indeed to mention it here once for all there are more Tokens of Antiquity to be seen everywhere in  Wales  than in any particular Part of  England  except the Counties of  Cumberland  and  Northumberland  Here we saw  Brecknockmere  a large or long Lake of Water Two or Three Miles over of which they have a great many Fables not worth relating the best of them is that a certain River call'd the  Lheweni  runs thro' it and keeps its Colour in Midchanel distinguish'd from the Water of the Lake and as they say never mingles with it They take abundance of good Fish in this Lake so that like the River  Theisse  in  Hungary  they say it is Twothirds Water and Onethird Fish The Country People affirm that once a City stood here but that by the Judgment of Heaven for the Sins of its Inhabitants it sunk into the Earth and the Water rose up in the Place of it I observe the same Story is mention'd by Mr  Camden  with some Difference in the Particulars I believe my Share of it  but 'tis remarkable that Mr  Camden  having lost the old City  Loventium  mention'd by  Ptolemy  to be hereabouts is willing to account for it by this odd Story  It was among the Mountains of this County that the famous  Glendower  shelter'd himself and taking Arms on the deposing  Richard  II proclaimed himself Prince of  Wales  they shew us several little Refuges of his in the Mountains whither he retreated and from whence again he made such bold Excursions into  England  as to have put  Henry  IV to very great Difficulties  Tho' this County be so mountainous Provisions are exceeding plentiful and also very good all over the Country nor are these Mountains useless even to the City of  London  as I have noted of other Counties for from hence they send yearly great Herds of Black Cattle to  England  and which are known to fill our Fairs and Markets even that of  Smithfield  itself  The yellow Mountains of  Radnorshire  are the same and their Product of Cattle is the same nor did I meet with any thing worth noticing except Monuments of Antiquity The Stories of  Vortigern  and  Roger  of  Mortimer  are in every old Woman's Mouth here There is here a great Cataract or Waterfall of the River  Wye  at a Place call'd  Rhajadr Gwy  in  Welsh  which signifies the Cataract or Waterfall of the  Wye  but we did not go to see it by reason there was a great Flood out at that time which made the Way dangerous There seemed to us a kind of Desart too on that Side which is scarce passable by Strangers so we made it our North Boundary for this Part of our Journey  We shall only add That  Radnor  is the Shire Town and hath a Castle that  Presteigne  in  Radnorshire  is a wellbuilt Town and the Assizes are held there  Entering  Glamorganshire  from  Radnor  and  Brecknock  we beheld  Monuchdennyhill  on our Left and the  Black Mountains  on the Right and all a Ridge of horrid Rocks and Precipices between over which if we had not had good Guides we should never have found our Way and indeed we began to repent our Curiosity in going out of the common Road as not having met with any thing worth the Trouble and the Country looking so full of Horror we thought to have given over the Enterprize and have left  Wales  out of our Circuit But after a Day and a Night engaging thus with Rocks and Mountains our Guide brought us down into a most agreeable Vale opening to the South and a pleasant River running through it call'd the  Taaffe  and following its Course we came in the Evening to the antient City of  Landaff  and Town of  Caerdiff  standing almost together  Landaff  in  Glamorganshire  is the Seat of the Episcopal See and a City but so small that it has not a Market but  Caerdiff  which is lower on the River is the Port and Town of Trade and has a very good Harbour opening into the  Severn  Sea about four Miles below the Town  The Cathedral is a neat Building and very antient they boast that this Church was a House of Religious Worship many Years before any other was founded in the Island and that the Christian Religion flourish'd in its primitive Purity from the Year till the  Pelagian  Heresy overspread this Country which being afterwards rooted out they plac'd St  Dobricius  as the first Bishop in this Town of  Landaff  then call'd  Launt  n  The Bishop of  Landaff  had formerly the Title of Archbishop the three first Bishops were afterwards sainted for their eminent Holiness of Life and the Miracles they are said to have wrought 'Tis observable the Cathedral was antiently but Foot long and broad and had neither Steeple nor Bells nor had they any other  Cathedral from the Year to the Year when Bishop  Urban  built the present Church with some Houses for the Clergy adjoining in the Nature of a Cloister  Tho' the Church is antient yet the Building is good and the Choir neat and pretty well kept  The South Part of  Glamorganshire  is pleasant agreeable and very populous insomuch that it is called  The Garden of Wales  Its Soil is fertile and rich and the low Grounds are so well cover'd with Grass and stock'd with Cattle that they supply the City of  Bristol  with Butter in very great Quantities salted and barrel'd up just as  Suffolk  does the City of  London    CaerphyliCastle  in  Glamorganshire  is one of the noblest Pieces of Ruins in the whole Island It was larger than any Castle in  England  that of  Windsor  excepted and from what remains of it was as beautiful in its Architecture as it is remarkable in its Ruins  Neath  is a Port where the CoalTrade is pretty considerable tho' it stands up within Land  Swanzy  is also a Seaport and a very considerable Town for Trade with a very good Harbour Here is also a very great Trade for Coals and Culm which they export to all the Ports of  Somerset Devon  and  Cornwall  and even to  Ireland  so that sometimes may be seen a hundred Sail of Ships at a time loading Coals here which greatly enriches the Country and particularly this Town it stands on the River  Twye  or  Taw  'Tis very remarkable that most of the Rivers in this County chime upon the Letters  T  and  Y  as  Taaf Tawy Tuy Towy Tyevy    There are lately Mineral Waters found out at  Swanzy  which are reported to be of great Efficacy in Fluxes and Haemorrhages of all Sorts Consumptions if not too far gone Diabetes Palsies Rheumatisms  Dropsies and other Distempers are said to fall before these Styptick and Restorative Waters They may certainly have very good Effects in many difficult Cases but it is doing an Injury to the Reputation of any Medicine in the World to make it a  Catholicon  and good for every thing  KynfigCastle  is now the Seat and Estate of the Lord  Mansel  who has here also a very noble Income from the Collieries which formerly denominated Sir  Edward Mansel  one of the richest Commoners in  Wales  The Family was innobled by her late Majesty Queen  Anne    In this Neighbourhood near  Margan Mynydd  we saw the famous Monument mention'd by Mr  Camden  on a Hill with the Inscription which the Vulgar are so terrify'd at that nobody cares to read it for they have a Tradition from Father to Son that whoever ventures to read it will die within a Month We did not scruple the Adventure but when we came to try the Letters were so defac'd by Time that we were effectually secur'd from the Danger the Inscription not being any thing near so legible as it seems it was in Mr  Camden  's time  The Stone Pillar is about or Feet high and one Foot thick standing on the Top of this Hill there are several other such Monuments in  Radnorshire  and other Counties in  Wales  as likewise in  Scotland    Having thus touch'd on what is most curious on this Coast we pass'd thro' the Land of  Gowre  and going still  West  we came to  Caermarthen  or  KaerVyrdhin  as the  Welsh  call it the Capital of the County of  Kaermardhinshire    This is an antient and a very handsome Town pleasantly situated on the River  Towy  which is navigable up to the Town for Vessels of a moderate Burden and over which is a large Bridge The Town is wellbuilt and populous it is lately much  increas'd and is still increasing and the County round it is the most fruitful of any Part of  Wales  and continues to be so thro' all the Middle of the County and a great Way into the next nor is this County so mountainous and wild as the rest of this Part of  Wales  But it abounds in Corn and in fine flourishing Meadows as good as most are in  Britain  and in which are fed a very great Number of good Cattle  The  Chancery  and  Exchequer  for the South Part of the Principality were usually kept at this Town till the Jurisdiction of the Court and Marches of  Wales  was taken away This Town was also famous for the Birth of the old  British  Prophet  Merlin  of whom so many things are fabled and who flourish'd in the Year And here also the old  Britons  often kept their Parliaments or Assemblies of their wise Men and made their Laws The Town was fortify'd in former times but the Walls are not to be seen now and scarcely the Ruins of them The People in this Town and Country are reckon'd the wealthiest and politest in  Wales    Here we saw near  KilyMaen Llwyd  on a great Mountain a Circle of mighty Stones very much like  Stonehenge  in  Wiltshire  or rather like the  Rollrich  Stones in  Oxfordshire  and tho' the People call it  Bruarth Arthur  or King  Arthur's Throne  we see no reason to believe that it had any relation to him  The next County West is  Pembrokeshire  the most extreme Part of  Wales  on this Side It is a rich fertile and plentiful Country lying on the Seacoast where it has the Benefit of  MilfordHaven  one of the greatest and best Ports in  Britain  Mr  Camden  says it contains Creeks great Bays and good Roads for Shipping all distinguish'd as such by their Names and some say a thousand Sail of Ships may ride in it  Part of  Pembrokeshire  is inhabited by the Descendants of the  Flemings  placed there by King  Henry  I and that County is called  Little England beyond Wales    Before we quitted the Coast we saw  Tenbigk  the most agreeable Town on all the Seacoast of  SouthWales  except  Pembroke  being a very good Road for Shipping and well frequented Here is a great Fishery for Herring in its Season a great Colliery or rather Export of Coals and they also drive a very considerable Trade to  Ireland    From hence the Land bearing far into the Sea makes a Promontory call'd St  Goven'sHead  or  Point  But as we found nothing of Moment there we cross'd over the Isthmus to  Pembroke  which stands on the East Shore of the great Haven of  Milford    This is the largest and richest and at this Time the most flourishing Town of  SouthWales  except  Carmarthen  Here are a great many Gentlemen and Merchants and some of the latter are Men of good Business and they told us there were near Sail of Ships belong'd to the Town small and great in a Word all this Part of  Wales  is a rich and flourishing Country very pleasant fertile and well cultivated  This is the Place also made particularly famous for the Landing of King  Henry  VII then Earl of  Richmond    From hence being resolv'd to see the utmost Extent of the County West we ferry'd over the Haven and went to  Haverford  by some call'd  HaverfordWest  a County in itself and from thence to St  David  's  Haverford  is a good Town strong wellbuilt clean and populous  From hence to St  David  's the Country begins to look dry barren and mountainous  St  David  's is now a Bishop's See only but was formerly an Archbishop's which was transferr'd to  Dole  in  Britany  where it still remains  The venerable Aspect of this Cathedral Church shews that it has been a beautiful Building The Westend or Body of the Church is tolerable the Choir is kept neat the South Isle without the Choir and the Virgin  Mary  's Chapel which makes the Eastend of the Church are in a manner demolish'd and the Roofs of both fallen in  There have been a great many eminent Persons bury'd here besides such whose Monuments are defac'd by Time Here is St  David  's Monument to whom the Church is dedicated the Monument of the Earl of  Richmond  as also of the famous  Owen Tudor  Here are also four antient Monuments of KnightsTemplars known by their Figures lying crosslegg'd but their Names are not known and there are six several Monuments of Bishops who presided over this Church besides St  David    This Saint they tell us was Uncle to King  Arthur  that he lived to Years of Age that he was Bishop of this Church sixtyfive Years being born in the Year and died  Anno  that he built twelve Monasteries and perform'd abundance of Miracles  There was a very handsome House for the Bishop with a College all built in a Close by themselves but they are now in Ruins  Here the Weather being very clear we had a full View of  Ireland  though at a very great Distance The Land here is call'd St  David'sHead  They reckon up Bishops of this See since it began to the Year  A late Bishop of this See was Dr  Thomas Watson  of whom the World has heard so much being depriv'd after a long Debate on a Charge of  Simony  I shall not inquire into the Merits of the Case but he bestow'd great Sums on charitable Designs  From hence we turn'd North keeping the Sea in our West Prospect and a rugged mountainous Country  on the East where the Hills even darken'd the Air with their Height As we went on we past by  Newport  on the River  Nevern  a Town having a good Harbour and consequently a good Trade with  Ireland    Here we left  Pembrokeshire  and after about Miles came to  Cardigan  a wellinhabited Town on the River  Tyvy  over which it has a fair Stone Bridge 'Tis a very noble River indeed and famous for its Plenty of the best and largest Salmon in  Britain    The Country People told us that they had formerly Beavers here which bred in the Lakes among the Mountains and coming down the Stream of  Tyvy  destroy'd the young Frye of Salmon and therefore the Country People destroy'd 'em We thought they only meant the Otter till I found afterwards that Mr  Camden  mentions also that there had been Beavers seen here formerly  This Town of  Cardigan  was once possess'd by the great  Robert FitzStephen  who was the first  Briton  that ever attempted the Conquest of  Ireland  and had such Success with a Handful of Men as afterwards gave the  English  a Footing there which they never quitted afterwards till they quite reduc'd the Country and made it as it were a Province to  England    The Town is large and populous has a fair Church and is walled about and fortified with a Castle but that Part is now not much minded It has a good Trade with  Ireland  and is enrich'd very much as is all this Part of the Country by the famous Lead Mines formerly discover'd by Sir  Carbery Price  which are the greatest and perhaps the richest in  England  and particularly as they require so little Labour and Charge to come at the Ore which in many Places lies within a Fathom or two of the Surface and in some even bare to the very Top There are also Silver Mines in this County  Going North from the  Tyvy  about Miles we came to  Aberystwith  that is to say the Town at the Mouth of the River  Ystwith  It is a populous but a dark smoaky Place and we fansy'd the People look'd as if they had liv'd continually in Coal or Lead Mines However they are rich  The County of  Cardigan  is in no wise comparable to either of those  Welsh  Counties which we have already pass'd through there being a great deal of barren Lands in it However it is so full of Cattle that 'tis said to be the Nursery or BreedingPlace for the whole Kingdom of  England  South by  Trent  but this is not a Proof of its Fertility for tho' the feeding of Cattle indeed requires a rich Soil the breeding them does not the Mountains and Moors being as proper for that Purpose as richer Land  Now we enter'd  NorthWales  only I should add that as we pass'd we had a Sight of the famous  PlymlymonHill  out of the Eastside of which rise the  Severn  and the  Wye  and out of the Westside of it rise the  Rydall  and the  Ystwyth  This Mountain is exceeding high and though it is hard to say which is the highest Hill in  Wales  yet I think this bids fair for it nor is the County for Miles round it any thing but a continued Ridge of Mountains So that for a few Days we seem'd to be conversing in the upper Regions for we were often above the Clouds a great way and the Names of some of these Hills seem'd as barbarous to us who spoke no  Welsh  as the Hills themselves  Passing these Mountains North we enter'd North  Wales  which contains the Counties of  Montgomery Merioneth Caernarvon Denbeigh  and  Flint  Shires and the Isle of  Anglesea    In passing  Montgomeryshire  we were so tired with Hills and Mountains that we wish'd heartily we had kept close to the Sea Shore but we had not much mended the matter if we had as I understood  afterwards The River  Severn  is the principal Beauty of this County which rising out of the  Plymlymon  Mountain as I have said receives in a short Course so many other Rivers into its Bosom that it becomes navigable before it gets out of the County at  WelshPool  on the Edge of  Shropshire    Montgomery  is a fashionable Place and has many fair Dwellings in it and some very good Families  The Vales and Meadows upon the Banks of the  Severn  are exceedingly ornamental and profitable and 'tis said that the Water of the  Severn  like that of  Nile  when it overflows impregnates the Valleys by the Slime it leaves behind it all the Country is very fruitful whereever this River runs The Town of  Montgomery  lies not far from this River on the outer Edge of the County next to  Herefordshire  This was it seems a great Frontier Town in the Wars between the  English  and the  Welsh  and was beautify'd and fortify'd by King  Henry  III but it is not now so very considerable though a good Town still pleasantly situated and has a Castle  This County has been long noted for an excellent Breed of  Welsh  Horses which though not very large are exceeding valuable and much esteem'd all over  England  All the North and West Part of the County is mountainous and stony We saw a great many old Monuments in this Country and  Roman  Camps whereever we came and especially if we met any Persons curious in such things we found they had many  Roman  Coins  Merionethshire  or  Merionydshire  lies West from  Montgomeryshire  on the  Irish  Sea or rather the Ocean for St  George's Chanel  does not begin till further North and it is extended on the Coast for near Miles in Length all still mountainous and craggy The principal River is the  Tovy  which rises among the unpassable Mountains which range  along the Centre of this Part of  Wales  and which we look at with Astonishment for their prodigious Height Some of the Hills have particular Names but otherwise we called them all  The Black Mountains  and they well deserve the Name Some think 'tis from the unpassable Mountains of this County that we have an old Saying That the Devil lives in the  Middle of Wales  tho' I know there is another Meaning given to it in a word Mr  Camden  calls these Parts the  Alps of Wales    There are but few large Towns in all this Part nor is it very populous much of it being scarce habitable but 'tis said there are more Sheep in it than in all the rest of  Wales  On the Sea Shore however we saw  Harleigh  or  HarlechCastle  which is still a Garison and kept for the Guard of the Coast but 'tis of no other Strength than what its Situation gives it  In the middle of these vast Mountains and forming a very large Lake  viz  near its first Sources rises the River  Dee  of which I shall speak again in its proper Place  Here among almost innumerable Summits and rising Peaks of nameless Hills we saw the famous  KaderIdricks  which some are of Opinion is the highest Mountain in  Britain  another call'd  Rarauvaur  another call'd  Mowywynda  and still every Hill we saw we thought higher than all that ever we saw before  We inquired here after that strange Phaenomenon which was not only seen but fatally experienc'd by the Country round this Place namely of a livid Fire coming off from the Sea and setting on Fire Houses Barns Stacks of Hay and Corn and poisoning the Herbage in the Field of which there is a full Account given in the Philosophical Transactions And as we had it confirm'd by the general Voice of the People I shall take notice That the  Transactions particularly observe that the Eclipses of the Sun in  Aries  have been very fatal to this Place and that the Years and when the Sun was eclipsed in that Sign it suffer'd very much by Fire and after the latter Eclipse of the two the Fire spread so far that about Houses in the Town and Suburbs of  Caernarvon  were consum'd  This mountainous Country runs away North thro'  Merionethshire  and almost thro'  Caernarvonshire  where  Snowdenhill  of a monstrous Height according to its Name had Snow on the Top in the Beginning of  June  but it does not continue the Year round as some have asserted  These unpassable Heights were doubtless the Refuges of the  Britons  when in their continual Wars with the  Romans  and  Saxons  they were overpower'd  That Side of the County of  Caernarvon  which borders on the Sea is not so mountainous and is both more fertile and more populous The principal Place in this Part is  Caernarvon  a good Town with a Castle built by  Edward  I to curb and reduce the wild People of the Mountains and secure the Passage into  Anglesea  That Prince also kept his Court often here and here his eldest Son and Successor  Edward  II was born who was therefore call'd  Edward of Caernarvon  This  Edward  was the first of the Sons of the Kings of  England  vested with the Title of Prince of  Wales  And here were kept the  Chancery  and  Exchequer  of the Princes of  Wales  for the North Part of the Principality as it was at  Caermarthen  for the South Part It is a small but strong Town clean and wellbuilt and considering the Place the People are very courteous and obliging to Strangers It is seated on the Firth or Inlet call'd  Meneu  parting the Isle of  Anglesea  or  Mona  from the main Land and here  is a Ferry over to the Island called  AbermenaiFerry  ▪ And from thence a direct Road to  Holyhead  whithe  we went for no other Purpose than to have anothe  View of  Ireland  tho' we were disappointed the Weather being bad and stormy  Whoever travels critically over these Mountains of  SouthWales  and  Merionethshire  will think  Stonehenge  in  Wiltshire  and  Rollrich  Stones in  Oxforashire  no more Wonders seeing there are so many such in these Provinces that they are not thought strange of at all nor is it doubted but they were generally Monuments of the Dead as also are the single Stones of immense Bulk of which we saw so many that we gave over remarking 'em Some measur'd from to and one Feet high being a whole Stone but so great that the most of the Wonder is where they were found and how dragg'd to the Place since besides the steep Ascents to some of the Hills on which they stand it would be hardly possible to move some of them now with Yoke of Oxen And yet a great many of these Stones are found confusedly lying one upon another on the utmost Summit or Top of the  Glyder  and other Hills in  Merioneth  or  Caernarvonshire  to which it is next to impossible that all the Power of Art and Strength of Man and Beast could carry them and the Vulgar make no Difficulty of saying The Devil set them up there  One of these monumental Stones is to be seen a little way from  HarleighCastle  It is a large Stone lying flat supported by three other Stones at three of the four Angles tho' the Stone is rather oval than square it is almost Feet long the Breadth unequal but in some Places it is from to Feet broad and it may be supposed has been both longer and broader 'tis in some Places about two Feet thick but in others 'tis worn almost to an Edge by Time The three Stones that support it are about  Inches square 'tis supposed there have been four two of which that support the thickest End are near Feet high the other not above three Feet being suppos'd to be settled in the Ground so that the Stone lies sloping like the Roof of a Barn There is another of these to be seen in the Isle of  Anglesea  the flat Stone is much larger and thicker than this but we did not go to see it There are also two Circles of Stones in that Island such as  Stonehenge  but larger  This is a particular kind of Monument and therefore I took Notice of it but the others are generally single Stones of vast Magnitude set up on one End Columnwise which being so very large are likely to remain till the End of Time but are generally without any Inscription or regular Shape or any Mark to intimate for whom or for what they were so placed  These Mountains are indeed so like the  Alps  that except the Language of the People one could hardly avoid thinking he is passing from  Grenoble  to  Susa  or rather thro' the Country of the  Grisons  The Lakes also which are so numerous here make the Similitude the greater nor are the Fables which the Country People tell of these Lakes much unlike the Stories which we meet with among the  Switzers  of the famous Lakes in their Country Mr  Camden  's Continuator tells us of or Lakes in  Caernarvonshire  only We did not count 'em but I believe if we had we should have found them to be more rather than less  Here we met with the Char Fish the same kind which we saw in  Lancashire  and also in the Lakes of  Switzerland  and nowhere else that I have heard of in  Europe  The  Welsh  call it the  Torg  ch    There is nothing of Note to be seen in the Isle of  Anglesea  but the Town and the Castle of  Beaumaris  which was also built by King  Edward  I  and call'd  Beaumarsh  or the  Fine Plain  for here the Country is very level and plain and the Land is fruitful and pleasant The Castle was very large as may be seen by its Remains and that it was strong the Situation will tell also but 'tis now of no Use  As we went to  Holyhead  by the South Part of the Island from  Newborough  and came back thro' the Middle to  Beaumaris  we saw the whole Extent of it and indeed it is a much pleasanter Country than any Part of  NorthWales  that we had yet seen and particularly is very fruitful in Corn and Cattle  Here we cross'd the  Streight  of  Meneu  again and came to  Bangor  at the Place where King  Edward  I intended to have built a great Stonebridge It would indeed have been a Work fit for so great a King But the Bottom being doubtful and the Sea in that Place sometimes very raging and strong the Workmen thought it impracticable and though the King was very positive in his Design for a great while yet he was prevail'd with at last to decline it  Bangor  is a Town noted for its Antiquity It is a Bishop's See but has an old meanlooking and almost despicable Cathedral Church  This Church boasts of being one of the most antient in  Britain  the People say the most antient and that St  Daniel  to whom it was dedicated was first Bishop here in the Year They allow that the Pagans perhaps of  Anglesea  ruin'd the Church and possess'd the Bishoprick after it was built for above one hundred Years nor is there any Account of it from the Year to After this the Bishoprick was ruin'd again by one of its own Bishops whose Name was  Bulkeley  who as the  Monasticon  says not only sold the Revenues but even the very Bells for which Sacrilege it is said he was struck blind  It is certainly at present no rich Bishoprick yet the Bishops are generally allow'd to hold some other  good Benefice  in Commendam  and the Preferment seems to be a grateful Introduction to the Clergy as the Bishops are generally translated from hence to a more profitable one and very few Gentlemen of the Function have dy'd Bishops of  Bangor  so that in some Sense a Bishop of this See may be said to be immortal  From  Bangor  we went North keeping the Sea on our Lefthand to  Conway  This is the poorest but pleasantest Town in all this County for the Bigness of it it is seated on the Bank of a fine River which is not only pleasant and beautiful but is a noble Harbour for Ships had they any Occasion for them there the Stream is deep and safe and the River broad as the  Thames  at  Deptford  It only wants a Trade suitable to so good a Port for it infinitely outdoes  Chester  and  Liverpool  too  In this Passage we went over the famous Precipice call'd  Penmaenmaur  which I think Fame has made abundance more frightful than it is for tho' the Rock is indeed very high and if any one should fall from it he would be dash'd in Pieces yet on the other hand there is no Danger of it a Wall being built all the Way on the Edge of the Precipice to secure Passengers Those who have been at the Hill or Pass of  Enterkin  in  Scotland  know very well the Danger there is much greater than here and the frequent Loss of Lives both of Man and Horse will testify the same  We have but little remarkable in the Road from  Conway  to  Holywell  but Craggs and Rocks all along the North Shore of  Denbeigh  till we came to  Denbeigh  the County Town which has a Castle of great Strength it is a large populous Place and has a good Trade carry'd on by Tanners and Glovers This Town carries something in its Countenance of its Neighbourhood to  England  but that which was most surprising after such a tiresome and fatiguing  Journey over the inhospitable Mountains of  Merioneth  and  Caernarvonshire  was that descending now from the Hills we came into a most pleasant fruitful populous and delicious Vale full o  Villages and Towns the Fields shining with Corn▪ just ready for the Reapers the Meadows green and flowery and a fine River of a mild and gentle Stream running thro' it Nor is it a small or casua  Intermission but we had a Prospect of the Country open before us for above Miles in Length and from to Miles in Breadth all smiling with the same kind of Complexion which made us think ourselves in  England  again all on a sudden  In this pleasant Vale turning North from  Denbeigh  and following the Stream of the River we came to  St Asaph  in  Flintshire  a small City with a Cathedral being a Bishoprick of tolerable good Value though the Church is old It is but a poor Place and illbuilt although the Country is so pleasant and rich all round it There are some old Monuments in this Church but none of any Note nor could we read the  Welsh  Inscriptions  From hence we came to  Holywell  The Story of it is that the pious Virgin St  Winifred  being ravish'd and murder'd this healing Water sprung out of her Body when buried The  Romanists  believe it as 'tis evident from their thronging hither to receive Benefit from the healing Virtue of the Water which they do not hope for as medicinal but as miraculous and think it heals them by virtue of the Intercession and Influence of this famous Virgin St  Winifrid    The Chapel dedicated to this Holy Virgin is cut out of a solid Rock and Numbers of Pilgrims resort to it with great Devotion Under this Chapel the Water gushes out into a great Stream and the Place where it breaks out is form'd like a Basin or Cistern in which they bathe The Water is intensly  cold and indeed there is no great Miracle in that Point considering the Rocks it flows from where it is impregnated by divers Minerals the Virtue of which and not of the Saint I suppose work the greatest Part of the Cures that may be suppos'd to be effected there  There is a little Town near the Well which may indeed be said to have risen from the Confluence of People thither for almost all the Houses are either Publick Houses or let into Lodgings and the Priests who attend here and are very numerous appear in Disguise Sometimes they are Physicians sometimes Surgeons sometimes Gentlemen and sometimes Patients or any thing as Occasion presents Nobody takes notice of them as to their Religion though they are well known no not the  Roman Catholicks  themselves but in private they have their proper Oratories in certain Places whither the Votaries resort and good Manners has prevail'd so far that no Protestant let him know what he will takes Notice of it or inquires where one goes or has been gone  The principal Towns in  Flintshire  are  Flint  the Shire Town but so small that it has not a Market  St Asaph  beforemention'd  Caerwys  the chief MarketTown of the County  From hence we pass'd by  FlintCastle  a known Place but of no Consequence now and directly to  Wrexham  deemed the largest Town in  NorthWales  having heard much of a fine Church there but we were greatly disappointed There is indeed a very large Tower or Steeple as some call it adorn'd with Imagery but far from fine The Work is mean the Statues without any Fancy or Spirit and as the Stone is of a reddish crumbling Kind like the Cathedral at  Chester  Time has made it look gross and rough  There are a great many antient Monuments in this Church and in the Churchyard also but none of  Note and almost all the Inscriptions are in  Welsh  The Church is large but they must be much mistaken who tell us 'tis one of the finest in  England  for it falls short in that respect of even those Churches which are as old as itself  This Town is large wellbuilt and populous and besides the Church there are two large MeetingHouses in one of which we were told they preach in  Welsh  one Part of the Day and in  English  the other Here is a great Market for Flannel which the Factors buy up of the poor  Welsh  People who manufacture it and thence it is sent to  London  and is a considerable Manufacture thro' all this Part of the Country by which the Poor are very profitably imploy'd  We could not omit seeing the once famous  Banchor  which  Malmsbury  confounds with the Episcopal  Bangor  and were pleas'd to see there a fine Stone Bridge over the  Dee  This was once a City and the Monastery was so famous that in the Time of the  British  Kings it was said to contain Monks who in their Turns  viz  each Hour of the reading Prayers and singing Psalms continually Divine Service was perform'd Day and Night without Intermission But now not so much as the Ruins are to be seen and as all the People in the little Village that takes place of it spoke  Welsh  we could find no body that could give us any Intelligence So effectually had Time eras'd the very Foundations of the Place  This is said to be the Birthplace of that Archheretick  Pelagius  who from hence began to broach his heretical Opinions which afterwards so terribly overspread the Church  Camden  observes that this  Bangor  is situated in the County of  Flint    But before I have intirely done with the Principality give me leave to observe briefly a few things with relation to this Journey and the Gentlemen of  Wales    Tho' this Journey and especially over such monstrous Hills and Precipices as those in  Merioneth  and some other Shires was a little heavy to us yet were we well supported through it for we generally found their Provisions very good and cheap and pretty good Accommodations in the Inns  The  Welsh  Gentlemen are very hospitable and the People in general very obliging and conversable especially to Strangers When we let them know we travell'd merely in Curiosity to view the Country their Civility was heightened to such a Degree that nothing could be more friendly and they were willing to tell us every thing that belong'd to their Country and to shew us all that we desir'd to see  They value themselves much upon their antient Heroes as  Caractacus Owen ap Tudor  Prince  Lewellin  and particularly upon the Antiquity of their Families and laugh at a Pedigree that can't be trac'd higher than the Conquest It must be own'd that the Gentlemen justly claim a very antient Descent and have preserv'd their Families intire for many Ages They receive you well into their Houses treat you very handsomely are very generous and indeed nothing is wanting within Doors and what is more they have generally very good Estates to support their Hospitality but they are very jealous of Affronts and soon provok'd to Anger which is seldom allay'd without Satisfaction and then become as soon reconcil'd again  I will now put an End to this Letter with assureing you that  I am c  LETTER VII CONTAINING A Description of Part of  Cheshire Northamptonshire  and  Leicestershire    SIR  _I Continued at  Chester  for some time except that I made two or three Excursions into the neighbouring Country and particularly into that Part of  Shropshire  which I had not view'd as I went as also into the North and Northwest Parts of  Cheshire  But I should first acquaint you that  Malpas  through which I came from  Wales  is situate on a high Hill and was formerly strengthened by a Castle which is now in Ruins The Church is a stately Building and stands on the most eminent Part of the Town It has Rectors who do Duty alternately The Town consists of Streets and is well pav'd has a good Market a GrammarSchool and an Hospital  The first Trip I made was into the  Cestria Chersonesus  as I think we may properly call it It is bounded by the two great Firths or Arms of the Sea  the one call'd the Mouth of the  Dee  and the other of the two Rivers  Mersey  and  Weaver  which form it into a Peninsula It is about Miles long or over and has not one Market Town in it tho' it is exceeding rich and fertile occasion'd possibly by the Neighbourhood of two such great Towns as  Chester  and  Liverpool    Going down from  Chester  by the  Rhoodee  as they call it that is the Marshes of the River  Dee  and coasting the River after it is grown broader than the Marshes the first Place of any Note which we come to is  Nesson  where in the late  Irish  War most of the Troops embark'd for that grand Expedition From hence the Vessels go away to  Highlake  where they ride safe in their Way as the Ships from  London  lie in the  Downs  till the Wind presents for their respective Voyages  But to return to  Chester  It is a fine old City and Colony of the  Romans  and many Antiquities have been found in it It has four Churches beside the Cathedral which is a Pile venerable for Antiquity but in no extraordinary Condition There are Shadows of many Pictures on the Wall but defac'd At the West End in Niches are some Images of the Earls Palatine of  Chester  The adjoining Abbey is quite ruin'd The Walls round the City are kept in very good Repair at the Charge of the Corporation and afford a pleasant airy Walk The Exchange is a neat Building supported by Columns Feet high of one Stone each Over it is the Cityhall a wellcontrived Court of Judicature The Castle was formerly the Palace where the Earls assembled their Parliaments and enacted Laws independent of the Kings of  England  determining all Causes themselves It has always a Garrison kept in it The Piazza's or Rows as they call them do not in my Opinion add any thing to the Beauty of the City but on the contrary serve to make it look  both old and indifferent These  Rows  are certain long Galleries up one Pair of Stairs which run along the Side of the Streets before all the Houses tho' joined to them and as is pretended they are to keep the People dry in walking along This they do indeed effectually but then they take away all the View of the Houses from the Street nor can a Stranger that was to ride thro'  Chester  see any Shops in the City besides they make the Shops themselves dark and the Way in them is dark dirty and uneven  The best Ornament of the City is that the Streets are very broad and fair and run thro' the whole City in strait Lines crossing in the middle of it as at  Chichester  The Walls afford a very pleasant Walk as I have said round the City and within the Battlements from whence you may see the circumjacent Country and particularly on the Side of the  Rhoodee  which is a fine large low Green on the Bank of the  Dee  which in Winter is often under Water by the Inundations of the River Beyond the  Rhoodee  may be seen from the Walls of  Chester  the County of  Flint  and the Mountains of  Wales    The Castle is a good firm Building and strong tho' not fortify'd with many Outworks There is always a good Garrison kept in it 'Tis said this Castle was built or at least repair'd by  Hugh Lupus  the famous Earl of  Chester  Nephew to  William  the Conqueror as was also the Church the Body of whom was lately  Anno  discover'd as is supposed in an old ruinous Building called The Chapterhouse  It was first wrapp'd in Leather and then inclos'd in a Stone Coffin The Skull and all the Bones were very fresh and in their proper Position and what is more remarkable the String which ty'd the Ankles together was whole and intire altho' it was then upwards of Years since the Interrment  Chester  is but a modern Bishoprick being so made in the Year when King  Henry  VIII divided it from  Lichfield  They tell us that King  Edgar  who conquer'd all this Part of  Britain  and was rowed up the  Dee  in his Royal Barge by Seven or as some say Eight Kings himself steering the Helm founded the great Church which  Lupus  finish'd and endow'd  Here is a noble Stone Bridge over the  Dee  very high and strong built and 'tis needful it should be so for the  Dee  is a most furious Stream at some Seasons and brings a vast Weight of Water with it from the Mountains of  Wales    Chester  has long given Title of Earl to the Prince of  Wales  eldest Son of the King  Chester  was formerly an Harbour for Shipping but the Sea had long ago withdrawn itself and the River  Dee  was so choaked up that Vessels of Burden could not come within some Miles of it so that an Act of Parliament passed in the Year for rendering it navigable And in Pursuance thereof the Undertakers raised a Sum of  l  which they have expended in cutting and perfecting a new Chanel for the River  Dee  of near Ten Miles in Length and in making proper Dams and Sluices into which they have turned the said River so that it is actually navigable at this Time for Ships and Vessels of considerable Burdens to the Quay or Key of  Chester  where they load and unload Goods and Merchandize This Success encourag'd the Undertakers to apply to Parliament for further Powers to complete the same and for uniting the said Undertakers into a Company for that laudable Purpose  This County though so remote from  London  is one of those which contributes much to its Support as well as to that of several other Parts of  England  by its excellent Cheese which they make here in  such Quantities that as I am told from very good Authority the City of  London  only takes off Tons every Year besides vast Quantities which they send to  Bristol  and  York  and also to  Scotland  and  Ireland  so that the Quantity of Cheese made here must be prodigiously great Indeed the whole County is imploy'd in it and Part of its Neighbourhood too for though it goes by the Name of  Cheshire Cheese  yet great Quantities of it are made in such Parts of  Shropshire Staffordshire  and  Lancashire  as border upon  Cheshire    The Soil is extraordinarily good and the Grass has a peculiar Richness in it which disposes the Kine to give a great Quantity of Milk which is very sweet and good and this Cheese Manufacture increases every Day raises the Value of the Lands and encourages the Farmers to keep vast Stocks of Cows which of themselves contribute to improve and enrich the Land  While we were station'd as I may say at  Chester  I made a Trip to several Places round about it And particularly to the fine old Seat of the Lord  Delamere  and the spacious Forest which gives Title to that noble Family They say here was formerly an old City now called the  Chamber on the Forest  probably some Fort or Camp to secure the Road From hence is so fine a Prospect of the  Welsh  Mountains that I never before beheld such a noble Scene of Nature  BeestonCastle  is on our left built upon a Precipice This Forest is noted for great Plenty of Red and Fallow Deer and is a great Relief for Fish Fowl and Turf to the neighbouring Towns whereof there are a great many small ones about this Forest and thro' the upper Part of it the  Weaver  takes its Course The chief Town hereabout is  Fr  desham  famous formerly for a Castle and the Seat of the Family of the  Savages  which however is but a mean Markettown Near this Place is also  the famous Seat of  RockSavage  built on the Ascent of an Hill belonging to the same Family whereof the last was the late Earl  Rivers    On the South Side of the Park stands  Beeston  Castle upon an Hill environ'd with Mountains and yet overlooks almost the whole County It is very strong covers a great Extent of Ground and is adorn'd with many Towers It gives Name to an antient Family in this County  From  Chester  we kept directly on East to  Middlewich  a large Markettown with a spacious Church but chiefly noted for making Salt where are Two excellent Brineseeths  We followed the  Weaver  directly North to  Northwich  also famous for Brinesprings and for making great Quantities of the finest Salt by boiling the Water in large iron Pans of small Depth As fast as the Salt crystallizes they rake it out and dry it in wicker Baskets of a conick Form The Duty it brings in is very considerable  Within these Fifty Years on the Southside of the Town they discover'd a great many Mines of Rocksalt which they continually dig up and send in great Lumps to the maritime Ports where it is dissolv'd and made into eating Salt We were let down by a Bucket Feet deep to the Bottom of the Salt Quarry a most pleasant subterraneous Prospect looking like a Cathedral supported by Rows of Pillars and Roof of Crystal all of the same Rock transparent and glittering from the numerous Candles of the Workmen labouring with their Steel Pickaxes in digging it away This Rockwork extends to several Acres  There is a good Church at  Northwich  with a fine Roof and semicircular Choir  At  Lawtonyates  they bore Yards deep for the Salt Spring at  Hassal  at  Wheelock  about  Middlewich  less at  Northwich  it rises to open Day  which seems to intimate that the salt Spring runs between Layers of the Earth in an horizontal Line Upon Boring it rises with great Impetuosity so that the Workmen have scarce Time to get out of the Wells This is all along the Side of a Brook that comes from a remarkable Hill called  Mawcop  upon the Edge of  Staffordshire  so that the Ground rises above the true Level in the mentioned Proportion  From  Northwich  we travell'd Northeast and came to  Knutsford  a good Town and finely situated A Brook runs thro' it and divides it into two It has a Market and Townhouse and a pretty good Parochial Church  Altringham  and  Stockport  Two small Markettowns lie higher up Northward the first near and the other upon the Borders of  Lancashire  and hearing of nothing remarkable in them we turned Southeast from  Knutsford  to  Macclesfield  which they call in this County  Maxfield    Macclesfield  is situate in the Forest of the same Name a Town of great Antiquity and very fair and spacious 'Tis under the Government of a Mayor and enjoys many particular Privileges by virtue of the Court and Liberties of the Forest It has a good Church with a high Spire Steeple and a College adjoining to it in which are buried a great many of the  Savages  and here is also a good Freeschool and a thriving Manufacture of Buttons  From hence we veer'd about and came Southwest to  Congleton  near the Borders of  Staffordshire  a fair Mayortown and wellwater'd on all Sides It has Two Churches and is noted for a good Trade in Gloves  We then came to the Markettown of  Sandbach  which is delightfully situated on a Branch of the  Weaver  It has a fair Church and in the Marketplace stand Two Crosses of Stone with the History  of Christ's Passion ingraven on them The Ale here is deservedly famed  From  Sandbach  we went on Southward and came to the great  London  Road at  Namptwich  which stands upon it This Town is wellbuilt and the Streets look fair having a great many Gentlemens Houses in them The Church is a noble Edifice in the Form of a Cross with the Steeple rising from the Middle but the Maintenance of the Minister is mean and pitiful The Inhabitants are rich and carry on a good Trade in most sort of Commodities but principally in making Salt and Cheese the latter exceeding all that is made in the County as the Soil this Way is esteemed the best and as 'tis said was called by King  Edward  I the  Vale Royal    Thus having made my Circuit round the County I shall go from hence South to  Whitchurch  in  Shropshire  But I must first note two things of  Cheshire  That there is no Part of  England  where there are equal Numbers of Gentry of such antient and noble Extraction Mr  Camden  is very particular in their Names and Descents to whom therefore I must refer That it is a County  Palatine  and has been so for many Ages and its Government is distinct from any other and very particular it is administred by a  Chamberlain  a  Judge Special  who is call'd  Chief Justice  of  Chester  two  Barons  of the  Exchequer  three  Sergeants at Law  a  Sheriff  an  Attorney  an  Escheator  and all proper and usual subordinate Officers and the Jurisdiction of all these Offices is kept up and preserv'd very strictly only we are to note that the  Judge Special  as he is call'd tries only civil Causes not criminal which are left to the ordinary Judges of  England  who go the Circuits here as in other Places  Whitchurch  is a pleasant large and populous Town and has a very good Church in which is the famous Monument of the great  Talbot  first E of  Shrewsbury    who was call'd in his Time the  English  ACHILLES and who was so renown'd in the Wars of  France  that no Man in that Kingdom dared to encounter him singlehanded He had ingraven on one Side of his Sword  Sum Talboti  and on the Reverse  Pro vincere inimicos meos  His Epitaph is as follows in capital Letters  ORATE PRO ANIMA PRAENOBILIS DOMINI DOMINI IOHANNIS TALBOTT QUONDAM COMITIS SALOPIAE DOMINI TALBOTT DOMINI FURNIVALL DOMINI VERDON DOMINI STRANGE DE BLACKMERE ET MARESCHALLI FRANCIAE QUI OBIIT IN BELLO APVD BVRDEWS VII IVLII MCCCCLIII  This Town has a good Market and a great many Gentry near it whereof some are  Romancatholicks  They tell us that this Town when King  Charles  I remov'd his Standard from  Nottingham  to  Shrewsbury  raised a whole Regiment for his Service  From hence we turn'd South and passing by  Wem  the Title given by King  James  II to his Lord Chancellor  Jefferies  thence we came to  Elsmere  which gives Title of Baron to the Duke of  Bridgwater  and is famous for a great Lake or Mere which gives the Town its Name and which the People pretend has in some Places no Bottom This Place is remarkable for good Fish  And further on West on the Confines of  Denbighshire  stands  Oswestry  a Bailiwick Markettown famous formerly for the Sale of  Welsh  Cottons and Flanels but now only for the last It is inclosed with a Wall and a Ditch and fortified with a Castle and has a good Church without the Gate covered with  Lead From hence we came the same Night to  Shrewsbury    Shrewsbury  is supposed to have been built out of the Ruins of the antient  Uriconium  In the Reign of  William  the Conqueror  Roger  Earl of  Montgomery  built a Castle here on the North Side and a stately Abbey some Ruins of which are still to be seen It is a beautiful large pleasant populous and rich Town full of Gentry and yet full of Trade too for here likewise is a great Manufacture as well of Flanel as also of white Broadcloth which inriches all the Country round it  The  Severn  in part surrounds this Town just as the  Thames  does the  Isle of Dogs  so that it makes the Form of an Horseshoe Over it are two fine Stone Bridges upon one of which is built a very noble Gate and over the Arch of the Gate the Statue of the great  Llewellin  the Idol of the  Welsh  and their last Prince of  Wales    This is really a Town of Mirth and Gallantry something like  Bury  in  Suffolk  or  Durham  in the North but much bigger than either of them or indeed than both together  Over the Markethouse is kept a kind of Hall for the Manufactures which are sold here weekly in very great Quantities they speak all  English  in the Town but on a Marketday you would think you were in  Wales    Here is the greatest Market the greatest Plenty of good Provisions and the cheapest that is to be met with in all the Western Part of  England  The  Severn  supplies them here with excellent Salmon but 'tis also brought in great Plenty from the  Dee  which is not far off and abounds with a very good Kind and is generally larger than in the  Severn  As an Example of the Cheapness of Provisions we paid here in a publick Inn but a Groat a Night for Hay and Sixpence a Peck for Oats for our Horses which is  cheaper than we found it in the cheapest Part of the North of  England  all our other Provisions were in Proportion and there is no doubt but the Cheapness of Provisions joined to the Pleasantness and Healthiness of the Place draws a great many Families hither who love to live within the Compass of their Estates  Mr  Camden  calls it a City and 'tis indeed equal to several good Cities in  England  and superior to some Near this Place was fought the bloody Battle between  Henry Hotspur  and  Henry  IV King of  England  in which the former was kill'd and all his Army overthrown and the Place is called  Battlefield  to this Day  Here are Five Churches Two of them with lofty Spires St  Chad  's and St  Mary  's are said to be antiently collegiate There are abundance of antient Monuments in them all which I have not room to mention  This Town will for ever be famous for the Reception it gave to King  Charles  I who after setting up his Standard at  Nottingham  and finding no Encouragement there remov'd to  Shrewsbury  being invited by the Gentry of the Town and Country round where he was receiv'd with such a general Affection and hearty Zeal that his Majesty recover'd himself from the Discouragement of his first Step at  Nottingham  and raised and compleated a strong Army in less Time than could be imagin'd insomuch that to the Surprize of the Parliament and indeed of all the World he was in the Field before them and advanced upon them so fast that he met them Twothirds onward of his Way to  London  and gave them Battle at  Edgehill  near  Banbury    But the Fate of the War turning afterwards against the King the Weight of it fell heavy upon this Town and almost ruin'd it  But they are now fully recover'd and it is one of the most flourishing Towns in  England  The Walls and Gates are yet standing but useless and the old Castle is gone to Ruin as is the Case of almost all the old Castles in  England    It should not be forgotten that notwithstanding the Healthiness of the Place here broke out first that unaccountable Plague call'd  The Sweating Sickness Anno  which spread itself thro' the whole Kingdom and afterwards into several foreign Nations  Here is a good Freeschool the most considerable in this Part of  England  built and endow'd by Q  Elizabeth  with a very sufficient Maintenance for a Chief or HeadMaster and Three UnderMasters or Ushers The Buildings are very spacious and particularly the Library which has a great many Books in it The Schoolmasters have also very handsome Houses to dwell in so that the whole has the Face of a College  There was a fine School here before erected by the Town'speople and maintain'd several Years by their Contribution But the Queen took the Matter into her own Hands and built the whole Fabrick new from the Ground endowing it liberally out of her own Royal Bounty  Here I was shew'd a very visible and remarkable Appearance of the great antient Road or Way call'd  Watlingstreet  which comes from  London  to this Town and goes on from hence to the utmost Coast of  Wales  Remains of a Stone Bridge are to be seen in the Bottom of the River when the Water is low This Road is raised a good Height above the Soil and so strait that upon an Eminence you may see it Ten or Fifteen Miles before you and as much behind over many Hilltops answering one the other as a Vista of Trees  We lodg'd at an Inn called  Iveseybank  on the Borders between  Staffordshire  and  Shropshire  About  a Mile off in a large Wood stands  Boscobelhouse  or  WhiteLadies  as some call it where the  Pendrils  lived who preserved King  Charles  II after  Worcester  Battle and famous for the Royal Oak The Granddaughter of that  William Pendril  still liv'd in the House when I was there The Floor of the Garret which is a Popish Chapel formerly a Nunnery in Possession of the Family of  Cooksey  being matted prevents any Suspicion of a little Cavity with a Trapdoor over the Staircase where the King was hid His Bed was artfully plac'd behind some Wainscot that shut up very close A Descendant of the  Cookseys  still keeps the Gloves and Garters which his Majesty left behind him  The said Chapel is still standing and has some painted Saints upon the Wall at one End  A Bowshot from the House just by a Horsetrack passing thro' the Wood stood the Royal Oak into which the King and Col  Carlos  climbed by means of the Henroost Ladder when they thought it no longer safe to stay in the House the Family reaching them Victuals with the Nuthook It happened as the People related it to us that whilst the King and Colonel were in the Tree a Party of the Enemy's Horse sent to search the House came whistling and talking along this Road and when they were just under the Tree an Owl flew out of a neighbouring Tree and hover'd along the Ground as if her Wings were broken which the Soldiers merrily pursued  The Tree is now inclos'd within a Brick Wall the Inside whereof is cover'd with Laurel of which we may say as  Ovid  did of that of the  Augustan  Palace  Mediamque tuebere quercum  For the Oak is in the Middle almost cut away by Travellers whose Curiosity leads them to see it Close by the Side grows a young thriving Plant from one of its Acorns  After the Restoration the King reviewing the Place no doubt with very different Emotions to what he had when he was in it gather'd some of the Acorns and set them in  St James's Park  or Garden and us'd to water them himself If we may judge of the Value the King put upon his Preservation and Royal Person it was worth  l per Annum  and one should think a King if worth any thing worth that for so much he gave to  Pendril  and it now remains in the Family Over the Door of the Inclosure is this Inscription cut in Marble  Felicissimam arborem quam in asylum potentissimi regis  Caroli II  Deus O M per quem reges regnant hic crescere voluit tam in perpetuam rei tantae memoriam quam specimen firmae in reges fidei muro cinctam posteris commendant  Basilius    Jana Fitzherbert  Quercus amica Jovi  That is  Basil  and  Jane Fitzherbert  recommend to Posterity this most fortunate Tree which the Allgacious and Almighty God by whom Kings reign ordained here to grow to be the Asylum of the most potent Prince King  Charles  II and have begirt it with a Wall as well in perpetual Remembrance of so great an Event as a Testimony of their firm Allegiance to Kings  The Oak belov'd by  Jove    Ten Miles Southeast of  Shrewsbury  stands  Great Wenlock  an antient Borough and good Markettown The noted  Wrekenhill  stands higher up North of it between the  Watlingstreet  and the  Severn  and within a Mile of  Wroxeter  the famous  Roman  Station It ascends gradually from a pleasant level Ground strikes out a pretty great Length and is well adorn'd with Trees 'Tis the highest  Ground in all the County and gives a fine Prospect all around it  Following  the Watling street  North we came to a small Markettown call'd  Wellington  of very little Note and still keeping  the Street  we arrived at  Newport  on the Borders of  Staffordshire  a little Markettown where is one of the noblest Foundations for a School in the whole Kingdom endowed by one  Adams  an Haberdasher of  London  to the Value of  l  The School is Feet long wide and the same in Height a Library a House for both the Master and Usher  l  a Year to the first and  l  to the other and a Garden to each House of an Acre and Two Acres for the Boys to play in Near it he has likewise built an Almshouse and gave  l  towards building the Townhouse Over the Schooldoor is this Distich  Scripsisti haeredem patriam tibi quae dedit ortum  Scriberis ergo tuae jure pater patriae  That is  Thy Country is thy Heir and therefore we  Justly esteem thy Country's Parent Thee  Between this Town and  Drayton  a small Markettown higher up Northward and likewise on the Borders of  Staffordshire  is  Bloreheath  famous for a Battle fought between the House of  York  and that of  Lancaster  wherein  Nevil  Earl of  Salisbury  for the former with Men only beat Lord  Audley  with Men after a most bloody Engagement  Entering  Staffordshire  we quitted the said  Streetway  a little to the left to see  Stafford  the Countytown and the most considerable except  Litchfield  in the County In the Way we pass'd thro' a small but antient Town call'd  Penkrige  vulgarly  Pankrage  probably the  Penn  erucium  of the  Romans    where happen'd to be a Fair We were surprised to see the prodigious Number of the finest and most beautiful Horses that can anywhere be seen brought hither from  Yorkshire  the Bishoprick of  Durham  and all the Horsebreeding Counties in  England  we were told there were not less than an hundred Jockeys or Horsekopers as they call them there from  London  to buy Horses for Sale Also an incredible Number of Gentlemen attended with their Grooms to buy Hunters and good Road Horses In a Word I believe I may mark it for the greatest HorseFair in the World for Horses of Value and especially those we call SaddleHorses tho' there were great Numbers of fine large StoneHorses for Coach and Draught too  From hence we came in Two Hours easy Riding to  Stafford  on the River  Sow  'Tis an antient Town and gives Name to the County but we thought to have found in it something more worth going so much out of the Way for It is however neat and wellbuilt and pleasantly seated in low Grounds and is lately much increased and grown rich by the Clothingtrade It is governed by a Mayor and other inferior Officers consists of Two Parishes and has a good Freeschool 'Tis said this Town retains the antient Custom of  Borough English  which is that the youngest Sons inherit the Lands of their Fathers within the Town Here is likewise a fine square Marketplace where stands the ShireHall and the Streets are well paved  We tarry'd here a few Days in order to visit the Towns lying on each Side of it with more Attention and Convenience  Eccleshall  lies Northwest of  Stafford  and is a pretty Markettown noted for Pedlerywares and a little Markettown call'd  Stone  lies upon the  Trent    Line  stands still further North  Trent  'Tis govern  d by a  Mayor Two Justices Two Bailiffs and Commoncouncil and holds Pleas under  s  The Streets are large broad and pav'd but the Houses are low and generally thatch'd the Clothingtrade flourishes here and the Town is surrounded with Coalpits Here are the Ruins of an old Castle The Coals here are cut out in Slices and shine with all the various Colours of a Peacock's Tail and therefore are call'd  PeacockCoals    Dr  Plot  as an Instance of the Growth of Stones mentions that near this Place was found a Stone with a Man's Skull Teeth and all inclosed in it And here is an excellent Device for the Taming of Shrews they put a Bridle into the Scold's Mouth which deprives her of the Power of Speech by which she is led about the Town and expos'd to publick Shame till she promises Amendment  Betley  a little Markettown lies West of  Newcastle  upon the Borders of  Cheshire    Breewood  is a pretty Markettown lying Southwest of  Stafford  And due South stands  Wolverhampton  a very antient Town situate on an Hill which is wellbuilt pav'd and inhabited Here the Trade of Lockmaking is carry'd on to great Perfection In its Church are several old Monuments and a Brass Statue of Sir  Richard Leveson  who engag'd the  Spaniards  under Sir  Francis Drake  The Pulpit is very old and of Stone and in the Churchyard is a very old Stone Cross From the Hill on which the Town is situated run Four weak Springs of different Qualities which is the only Water they have to supply this large and populous Town  Walsal  East of  Wolverhampton  is a good pleasant Corporatetown governed by a Mayor and situate on the Top of an Hill This Place is famous for Ironmines and Ironworks such as Spurs Bridlebits Stirrups Buckles  c  in which there is a considerable Trade carried on  Upon the Extremity of the County South just on the Borders of  Worcestershire  is situate upon a high Mountain the famous antient Castle of  Dudley  a Building of great Extent with Trenches about it cut out of a Rock and hath a high Tower upon it on the Southside It was built by  Dodo  a  Saxon  in Great Part of it is in Ruins and the rest is converted into a noble Seat where the Lord  Dudley  and  Ward  resides The Castle overtops all the Trees that surround it and has a most extensive Prospect over Five Shires and into part of  Wales  In the Hall of this Castle is a Table all of one intire Plank which before it was fitted up there was Yards long and Yard in Breadth but being too long for the Hall Yards and Inches of it was cut off and made a Table for the Hall of a neighbouring Gentleman What a prodigious Oak must this have been that had a Length of Yards and a Diameter of one Yard from one End to the other  The Town of  Dudley  lies near it but in  Worcestershire  and is only remarkable for being in a different County from the Castle  The People in this County have been more particularly famous than any other for good Footmanship and there have been and still are among them some of the fleetest Runners in  England  which must be owing to their exercising themselves to it from their Childhood for running Footraces seems to be the general Sport or Diversion of the Country  Near  Stafford  we saw  Ingestre  where the late  Walter Chetwynd    Esq  built or rather rebuilt a very fine Church at his own Charge and where the late Lord  Chetwynd  has with a Profusion of Expence laid out the finest Park and Gardens that are in this Part of  England    I am now at the utmost Extent of my proposed Limits for this Circuit for  Ingestre  Parks reach to  the very Banks of the  Trent  So I turn'd to the Right and intending for  Litchfield  in the Way we saw  Beaudesert  a famous old Seat said to be built by  Hugh Lupus  Earl of  Chester  The Name indeed intimates it to be of  Norman  or  French  Original at present it is in the noble Family of  Paget  Earl of  Uxbridge  who is styled Baron of  Beaudesert  The Park is very fine and its Situation exceeding pleasant but the House is antient In the Park is a famous Piece of Antiquity  viz  a large Camp or Fortification surrounded with a double Trench very large and deep  From hence 'tis about four or five Miles to the City of  Litchfield  the principal next to  Chester  of all the Northwest Part of  England  nor indeed is there any other but this and  Coventry  in the whole Road from  London  to  Carlisle  which is on the Edge of  Scotland    At  Rugely  which is an handsome wellbuilt Town finely situated near the  Trent  we came into the great  Lancashire  and  Cheshire  Road or the Northwest Road from  London  which passing through this City from  Warringtonbridge  in  Cheshire  falls into the  Watlingstreet  mention'd before about Three Miles Southeast from the Town and crosses another antient Causeway or Road call'd  Icknildstreet  about a Mile out of the City so that  Litchfield  lies as it were at the joining of all those great Roads But instead of going directly to  Litchfield  we struck out of the Road and went Northeast to  Bromley  a pretty Markettown and from thence East to  Tutbury  on the Skirts of  Derbyshire  It has a small Markettown with a Castle in it  Some Miles Southward stands  Burton upon Trent  where the Clothingtrade is carried on with great Advantage It is famous for its noble Bridge over the  Trent  consisting of Arches and of the Length  of Yards It is built of Freestone cut and squared  From hence we returned Southwest to  Litchfield  which is a fine neat wellbuilt and pretty large City It rose from the Ruins of the  Roman Etocetum  a Mile off now called  Chesterfieldwall  from some Reliques of its Fortifications There is a kind of slow sluggish Water which runs or rather glides heavily thro' it and so on for Four or Five Miles farther into the  Trent  but takes a swifter Motion as soon as it is out of the Town This Water parts the City into Two one Part is call'd the Town and the other the Close in the first is the Marketplace a fine School and a very handsome Hospital well endow'd This Part is much the largest and most populous but the other is the fairest has the best Buildings in it and among the rest the Cathedral Church one of the finest and most beautiful in  England    There are Two fine Causeways which join the City and the Close with Sluices to let the Water pass but those were cut thro' in the Time of the late intestine Wars in  England  and the Close which is wall'd about and was then fortify'd for the King was very strong and stood out several Attacks against  Cromwell  's Men and was not at last taken without great Loss of Blood on both Sides being gallantly defended and at last taken by Storm  There are in the Close besides the Houses of the Clergy Residentiaries a great many very wellbuilt and wellinhabited Houses which made  Litchfield  a Place of good Company above all the Towns in this or the neighbouring Counties of  Warwickshire  or  Derbyshire    The See is very antient and was once Archiepiscopal made so by King  Offa  and  Eadulph  the Archbishop was Metropolitan of all the Kingdom of the  Mercians  and  EastAngles  but it did not hold  it then it suffer'd another Diminution by having the See of  Chester  taken away which was once Part of this  They told us here a long Story of St  Chad  formerly Bishop of this Church and how he liv'd an Eremitical Life here by the Spring near  Stow  Church in a little Hovel or Cell But the Bishops since that Time fare better and make shift with a very fine Palace in the Close and the Residentiaries live in Proportion to them  They have another Legendary Story also at  Litchfield  namely that a thousand poor People being instructed in the Christian Faith by the Care of  Offa  King of the  Mercians  were all martyr'd here in one Field by the  Pagans  and that in the Field where they were so murder'd King  Oswy  of  Northumberland  caused a great Church to be built and from thence the City bears for its Device an open Field with mangled Carcasses lying dispers'd about in it as if murder'd and left unburied  The Church for the Elegancy and Regularity of the Building may be esteemed one of the most complete in  England  The Westend is richly decorated with the Statues of all the Kings who reigned in  Jerusalem  from  David  to the Captivity But it is too flat and wants Projection or as Architects call it  Relief  to give it Boldness The Two Towers are much too low for their Breadth and look very heavy for want of Windows especially where the Bells hang The circular Staircases projecting octagonally at one Angle only of each without any of the other Three Angles answering is a great Irregularity But the Spires above them are carried up in an exceeding beautiful Taste much beyond any other  Gothick  Spires that I have seen The middle Tower and Spire of this Church are much higher than those at the Westend and are equally beautiful  The Spire designed for the Middle of  WestminsterAbbey  is an Imitation of the middle Spire of this Church  The great Window over the middle Door is very large and its Pediment finely adorn'd a large Cross finishing the Top of it  The Imagery and carv'd Work on the Front as above suffer'd much in the late unhappy Times and they told us the Cross over the West Window was frequently shot at by the rude Soldiers but that they could not shoot it down  The Saints of those Days also intirely ruin'd all the Ornaments of the Inside with the Brass Inscriptions Tombs  c  It is built in the midst of a Bog for Security and held out some fierce Attacks for King  Charles  I and what the Outside suffer'd has been very well repair'd since the Restoration as well by the famous Bishop  Hacket  as by the Bounty of several noble and generous Benefactors  The  Monasticon  makes Mention of a Shrine given here for the Holy St  Chad  or St  Cedda  which cost  l  but I conceive that to smell as much of the Legend as the Miracles of St  Chad  himself since such a Gift at that Time must be equal to Two Millions of our Money  Antient Camps are found in the Neighbourhood of  Litchfield    From  Litchfield  we came to  Tamworth  a fine pleasant trading Town eminent for good Ale and good Company of the middling Sort and also for a fine Charity of the famous Bookseller Mr  Guy  who built and endow'd the noble Hospital in  Southwark  called by his Name The Town stands on the River  Tame  which runs through it and divides it into Two Parts one Part whereof is in this County and the other in  Warwickshire  It is a Bailiwick Town and a Place of good Account tho' it has been much more considerable Here was antiently a Palace of  the  Mercian  Kings and there is still remaining a square Trench call'd the King's Dyke This Town was given by the Conqueror to the  Marmyons  who built the Castle here and were hereditary Champions of  England  from whom that Office descended to the  Dymokes  of  Lincolnshire    From  Tamworth  we came to  SuttonColefield  a little Town situated in an excellent Air and among pleasant Woods tho' but in a barren Soil and then we came into the great Road again at  Coleshill  in  Warwickshire  a small but very handsome Markettown from whence we came to  Coventry  the Sister City to  Litchfield  and join'd in the Title of See which was for some little Time seated here but afterwards return'd to  Litchfield    Coventry  is a City of large Extent and populous and drives a very great Trade the Manufacture of Tammies is their chief Imploy and next to that weaving of Ribbons of the meanest kind chiefly black The Buildings are very old and in some Places very much decayed the Timberbuilt Houses project forwards into the Street towards one another insomuch that in the narrow Streets they almost touch at the Top a Method of Building formerly much practised in  London    The Tale of the Lady  Godiva  who rode naked thro' the HighStreet of this City to purchase its Exemption from oppressive Taxes is held for so certain a Truth that they will not have it question'd upon any Account whatsoever and in Memory of it the Inhabitants make a Procession yearly with a naked Figure of a Woman riding on Horseback thro' the City and the Picture of the poor Fellow who peep'd out of the Window to see her is still kept up looking out of a Garret in the HighStreet of the City but Mr  Camden  says positively nobody look'd at her at all Two Parliaments have been held in this City both remarkably denominated one  in the th of King  Henry  IV called  Parliamentum Indoctorum  the other in the th of King  Henry  VI called  Parliamentum Diabolicum  because of the Attainder pass'd in it against the House of  York  and its Partisans  At the Restoration of King  Charles  II the Walls and Towers of the City were demolish'd by that Prince's Command and only the Gates of it left standing by which the Beauty and Strength of the rest may be guess'd at  This City is a County incorporate of itself and has a great many Towns within its Liberties holds Pleas and is govern'd by a Mayor Aldermen and Subofficers but it had only Two Parish Churches that of the  Holy Trinity  and the Church of  St Michael  which were unable to hold half the Inhabitants till the Year when an Act passed for making the Church of  Bablack  in  Coventry  a Parish Church and for appointing a District or Parish thereto and for enabling the Master and Usher of the Free Grammarschool within the said City to be the Rector and Lecturer of the said Parish Church for all time to come This is called in the Act the Parish Church of St  John the Baptist  in the City of  Coventry  Besides these Three Churches and Parishes it has Four Steeples and the Cross is notedly one of its greatest Ornaments The Roads are kept well pav'd to it for a Mile round Here is a good Freeschool founded by  John Hales    Esq  by the Name of the School of King  Henry  VIII the Master of which is to be for the future the Minister of the new Parish Church as I have mentioned It has a good Library and there is also an Hospital for the Poor But here is no Cathedral as some have falsly said neither is the great Church so called either Collegiate or Conventual but only a Monastery or Priory  Yet this City contended a great while for thi  Honour but could not carry it In King  Henry  VIII's Time the Priory being dissolv'd the Church which they would have call'd a Cathedral was reduc'd to a private Parish Church and continues so to this Day 'tis also an Archdeaconry and the Bishop is styled Bishop of  Litchfield  and  Coventry    The Spire of the great Church is however very beautiful and Yards high There is another good Church in the same Yard the Cross a fine  Gothick  Work Feet high and in Niches are the Statues of several of the  English  Kings At the Southend of the Town stands a tall Spire by itself being what is left of the  Grey Friers  Conventual Church The Townhouse is worth seeing the Windows of it are painted Glass representing some of the old Kings Earls  c  who have been Benefactors to the Town  And a Copy of  Latin  Verses are there to be read in Praise of their Royal Benefactors in which are named the  Edwards  the  Henries  the Black Prince Queen  Elizabeth  the Duke of  Northumberland  and the great Earl of  Leicester    From  Coventry  we could by no means pass the Town of  Warwick  the Distance too being but about Six Miles and a very pleasant Way on the Banks of the River  Avon  'Tis famous for being the Residence of the great  Guy  Earl of  Warwick  of whom Tradition has deliver'd down to us so many hyperbolical Accounts that it is hardly possible to distinguish his real Actions from what are fabulous He flourished in the Reign of  Athelstane  and decided the Fate of the Kingdom by Compact in single Combat with  Colbrond  the  Dane  a Man of gigantick Stature whom he slew and afterwards led a Hermit's Life till his Death They shew us here his Castle his Helmet his Sword and tell abundance of things of  him which have some Appearance of History tho' not much Authority to support them So I leave that Part to the curious Searchers into Antiquity who may consult Mr  Camden Rous Dugdale  and other Antiquaries on that Subject who tell us the Castle was built before our Saviour's Time and has been a Place of great Consideration ever since  As to  Warwick  it is really a fine Town pleasantly situated on the Bank of the  Avon  over which is a large and stately Bridge the  Avon  being now grown a pretty large River  Warwick  has suffer'd much from all Quarters It was once destroy'd by the  Picts  and  Scots  after which the famous  Caractacus  who at the Head of the  Silures  oppos'd the  Romans  so long rebuilt it erecting there also a Palace for himself Then the  Romans  under  Ostorius  and after them the  Saxons  greatly damaged it and lastly the ravaging  Danes  ruined it  Tho' it was a Corporation by Prescription yet it took a Charter from  Philip  and  Mary  and since from  James  I and is now governed by a Bailiff and Burgesses It has a handsome Stonebuilt Markethouse upheld by Pillars and here is a good Freeschool and a wellendow'd Hospital for decayed Gentlemen Tho' it has been always accounted a handsome wellbuilt Town yet the Face of it is now quite alter'd and improv'd for having been almost wholly reduc'd to a Heap of Rubbish by a terrible Fire which happen'd the Fifth Day of  September  by the mere Accident of a Spark being blown from a Stick as it was carried cross a Lane to the Damage of  l  it was rebuilt by Act of Parliament and that in so noble and beautiful a manner that few Towns in  England  make so fine an Appearance  The Church and lofty Tower is newbuilt except the Eastend which is old and very good Work There are many fine Brass Monuments of the Earls of  Warwick  and others also one of the Earl of  Essex  Queen  Elizabeth  's unhappy Favourite and many Chapels and Confessionaries In the Chapterhouse on the Northside is a Tomb of the Lord  Brook  The Castle stands upon the River  Avon  on a solid Rock from whose Bowels that and the whole Town may be said to have been dug The Terrace of the Castle like that of  Windsor  overlooks a beautiful Country and sees the  Avon  running at the Foot of the Precipice from above Feet perpendicular Height for the solid Rock from the River on which it stands it Feet high but on the Northside it is even with the Town The Building is old but has been often repair'd and beautify'd and 'tis now a very agreeable Structure both within and without The Apartments are very nicely contrived and the Communication of the remotest Parts of the Building one with another is so well preserv'd by Galleries and by the great Hall which is very magnificent that one finds no Irregularity in the whole Building notwithstanding its antient Plan as it was a Castle built for Strength rather than a Palace to dwell in for Pleasure  A Stone Bridge with a Dozen Arches is at the Castle across is a Stonework Dam where the Water falls over it as a Cascade under the Castle Wall It is fenc'd with a deep Mound and strong embattled double Walls and lofty Towers On one Side the Area is a very high Mount There are good Apartments and Lodgings next the River the Residence of the Lord  Brook  The Priory on the Northeast of the Town overlooks a pleasant woody Vale There are a great many curious original Pictures in the Castle by  Vandyke  and other good Hands of Kings Queens and other noble Personages both  English  and Foreign  A Mile out of Town on the Side of a Hill is a pretty retired Cell called  Guycliff  In an old Chapel is  Guy  's Statue Eight Feet high The  Fence of the Court is intire Rock in which are cut Stables and Outhouses They shew'd us the rough Cave where they say the famous  Guy  dy'd an Hermit  While I was station'd as I may say at  Warwick  I took a Turn about the Country to view such Places of Note as lay something out of my intended Rout And first passing a Rivulet I came to the antient  Tripontium  plac'd in a pleasant little Valley the Sides of which are pretty steep The Road on the opposite Hill looks perfectly like a Perspectivescene at the Theatre This is a  Roman  Station rightly plac'd at  Dovebridge  upon the  Avon  running by  Rugby  to  Warwick  The Stream here divides into two with a Bridge over each Upon one is a short Inscription in Stone shewing the three Counties which repair it  Near this Place at  LegersAshby  in  Northamptonshire  has been an old Town as they say destroy'd by the  Danes Catesby  who hatch'd the Powderplot own'd the Town  We went on to  Daventry  a considerable Markettown govern'd by a Mayor Aldermen Steward and Freemen It lies on the great Road to  Chester  and is consequently a great Thoroughfare and well furnish'd with good Inns for it subsists chiefly by the great Concourse of Travellers that pass that way It lies also on the old  Watlingstreet  Way The Road was turn'd to pass through the Town and runs on to  Dunsmoreheath  where it crosses the  Fosse  and one Branch goes on to  Coventry  and the other joins the  Fosse  and goes on to a Place call'd  Highcross  of which further anon where it falls into the old  Watlingstreet  and both meet again near  Litchfield    It is a most pleasant Curiosity to observe the Course of these old famous Highways the  Ikenild  Way the  Watlingstreet  and the  Fosse  in which one sees so lively a Representatation of the antient  British  Roman  and  Saxon  Governments that one cannot help recalling those Times to the Imagination and though I am confin'd to such narrow Limits in this Work yet a Circuit or Tour thro'  England  would be very imperfect if I should take no Notice of these Ways seeing in tracing them we necessarily come to the principal Towns either that are or have been in every County and likewise in mentioning their Remains we give some Account of them as in their present State which falls directly in with my Design  From  Daventry  we went a little out of the Road to see a great Camp call'd  Burrowhill  upon the North End of an Eminence cover'd over with Fern and and Goss Here used to be kept a Horserace They say this was a  Danish  Camp and every thing hereabouts is attributed to the  Danes  because of the neighbouring  Daventry  which they suppose to be built by them The Road hereabouts too being overgrown with Daneweed they fansy it sprung from the Blood of the  Danes  slain in Battle and that if upon a certain Day in the Year you cut it it bleeds Originally it seems to have been  Roman  but perhaps newmodell'd by the  Danes    In  Norton  Town Road a  Cornu Ammonis  lies neglected too big to bring away  At  Weedon  is shewn the Scite of King  Wolfhere  's Palace the  Saxon  Kings of this Province residing here The Pastures call'd  The Ashes  are the  Roman  Camp St  Werberg  Daughter of King  Wolfhere  and Abbess to the Nunnery in this Place had here a Chapel Abundance of very fine Stone and many  Roman  Coins have been dug up  Weedon  now contains two Parishes and has been a Markettown  Towcester  is a considerable Town between two Rivulets which encompass it almost round  Old Stretford  stands on the opposite Side of the  Owse  to  StonyStratford  in the Fields thereabouts are found many  Roman  Coins  A little North of the  Horseshoeinn  stood Queen  Eleanor  's Cross which was pull'd down in the Civil Wars  To the West of  Stretford  stands  Whaddonhall  upon very high Ground affording a most beautiful Prospect This Manor formerly belong'd to the Lords  Grey  one of whom a Knight of the Garter is buried in the Church Here is the original Picture of Dr  Willis  the Progenitor of the present Possessor with many of his MSS Letters Consultations Lectures and other Works unpublish'd The Poets  Spencer  and the Duke of  Bucks  honour'd this Place with their Residence Still higher stands  Stukely  The Church is very intire tho' built before the Conquest in the plain antient manner  I now come to  Northampton  the handsomest Town in all this Part of  England  but here as at  Warwick  the Beauty of it is owing to its Disaster for it was so effectually burnt down that very few Houses were left standing and altho' the Fire began in the Daytime the Flame spread itself with such Fury and Speed that they tell us a Townsman being two Miles off upon a Hill on the Southside of the Town saw the Fire at one End of it just as it began and before he could reach the Town with all the Speed he could the other End was in Flames also 'Tis now finely rebuilt with Brick and Stone and the Streets made spacious and wide It has four Churches two Hospitals and a Charityschool well endow'd The Marketplace is square and spacious the Assizehouse is built after the  Corinthian  Order  Allhallows  Church is a pretty Edifice with a Cupola and a noble Portico before it of lofty  Ionick  Columns Upon the Balustrade is a Statue of King  Charles  II It is situate on the River  Nyne  over which there are two handsome Bridges and is walled in and on the West side are the Remains of an old Castle upon an Eminence  'Tis govern'd by a Mayor two Bailiffs a Recorder  c AllSaints  Church beforemention'd stands in a Centre where four large spacious Streets terminate The publick Buildings are esteem'd the finest that can be seen in any Countytown in  England  being all newbuilt But that Writer took very little Notice of  Northampton  or rather had never seen it who told us of a Cathedral a Chapterhouse and a Cloyster  The great Inn called the  George  at the Corner of the HighStreet looks more like a Palace than an Inn and cost above  l  building and so generous was the Owner that as we were told when he had built it he gave it to the Poor of the Town  This is counted the Centre of all the HorseMarkets and HorseFairs in  England  there being here no less than four Fairs in a Year And indeed  Northampton  is reckoned the Navel of  England  Here they buy Horses of all Sorts as well for the Saddle as for the Coach and Cart and hither  ll the Jockeys from  London  resort to purchase Horses  Near  Northampton  is the antient Royal House of  Holmeby  which was formerly in great Esteem and by its Situation is capable of being made a truly Royal Palace But the melancholy Reflection of the Imprisonment of King  Charles  I in this House and his being violently taken hence again by the Rebels has cast a kind of Disgrace upon the Place so that it has been forsaken The House and Estate was purchas'd by the Duchess of  Marlborough  and became Part of the Jointure which was settled on the Marchioness of  Blandford  It is at present possessed by a Farmer who has pull'd down Part of the Outhouses and converted the remaining Part into Barns Stables  c  A little way off of  Northampton  is  Naseby  where the bloody and fatal Battle was fought between the  Royalists and Parliamentarians upon a fine Plain where at present stands a Windmill and on it are the Marks of several great Holes where the Slain were buried and near this is  Guildsborough  so nam'd from a  Roman  Camp of a square Form and deep Ditch called  The Burrows    The Town of  Towcester  is of large Extent and very populous and having but one Parish Church which is two Miles distant from the Hamlet of  Althorpe  and  Foxcoate  in which there was a Chapel of  ase but officiated in only once a Month by the Vicar of  Towcester  though 'tis computed there are Souls in the said Hamlet who in the Wintertime cannot attend Divine Service at  Towcester  and several Benefactions having been given in case the said Hamlet should be erected into a Parish For all these Reasons an Act passed Sess for making the Chapel in the Hamlet of  Althorpe  and  Foxc  te  a Parish Church and for appointing a District or Parish thereto and according to the Condition of one of the Benefactions enabling the Master of the Free Grammarschool within the said Hamlet to be Vicar of the new Parish Church  The Seat of the Earl of  Pomfret  near  Towcester  is a stately Building and stands pleasantly amidst good Plantations of Wood Vista's and fine Prospects In the grand View to the back Front beyond the Garden is a large and long Canal Several curious Pictures are in the House But what inhances the Glory of this Seat is the vast Number of  Greek  and  Roman  Marbles Statues Busto's Basreliefs Urns Altars  c  Part of the invaluable Collection of the great Earl of  Arundel  and which are worthy of a Journey through half the Globe to behold The Hall is a fine lofty Room and the great Stairs are painted in Fresco by Sir  James Thornhill    Towcester  is a pretty Town of  Roman  Antiquity through which in a strait Line runs the  Watlingstreet    The Inhabitants of all Ages are here imploy'd in a silken Manufacture and Lacemaking The Town consists of one long Street and is almost intirely incompass'd with Water  The House late the Earl of  Sunderland  's at  Althorpe  now belonging to the Hon  John Spencer    Esq  Brother to his Grace the present Duke of  Marlborough  who is Earl of  Sunderland  has within these few Years changed its Face to much Advantage This antient Seat was rebuilt with great Improvement by  Robert  Earl of  Sunderland  Grandfather to the present Duke of  Marlborough  and is particularly noted for a magnificent Gallery furnish'd with a large Collection of curious Paintings by the best Hands  The Park is laid out and planted after the Manner of that at  Greenwich  and was design'd by  Le Notre  the same Person who planted St  James  's Park and  Cassioberry  as also several other Parks and Gardens in  England    There is a noble Piece of Water here on which is lately built a fine Vessel completely equipp'd as his Grace the Duke of  Bedford  has also at his Seat at  WoburnAbbey  There is likewise on this Water a fine  Venetian  Gondola Canoes  c  But this Water is situated too near the House and occasions so great a Damp that some of the Pictures in the Gallery are mildew'd thereby  At a convenient Distance from the House is lately built a handsome Square of Offices and near these is a large KitchenGarden finely walled and planted in which is a handsome Building for the Residence of the Gardener which is a Model of an  Italian  Villa  From hence we went North towards  Harborough  and in the Way in the Midst of deep dismal Roads the dirtiest and worst in all that Part of the Country we saw  Boughton  the noble Seat of the Duke of  Montagu  a House built by the first Duke very  much after the Model of the Palace of  Versailles  the treble Wings projecting and expanded forming a Court or Space wider and wider in proper Stades answerable to the Wings the Body of the House closing the whole View  The Hall is a very noble Room on the Ceiling is a Convocation of the Gods admirably painted as are many Suites of Rooms Staircases Galleries  c  beside the great Number of Portraits and other curious Pictures The Gardens contain Acres adorn'd with Statues Flowerpots Urns of Marble and Metal many very large Basons with Variety of Fountains playing Aviaries Reservoirs Fishponds Canals Wildernesses Terraces  c  The Cascade is very fine and a whole River running thro' the Length of the Gardens is diversify'd most agreeably to complete its Beauty  The Park is walled round with Brick and so finely planted with Trees and in such an excellent Order that I saw nothing more beautiful no not in  Italy  itself except that the Walks of Trees were not Orange and Lemon and Citron as it is in  Naples  and the  Abruzzo  and other Southern Parts of  Italy    A Mile off is  Geddington  where in a Trivium stands one of the Stone Crosses built by King  Edward  I in Memory of his Queen  Eleanor  These are said to be the Places where the Corps of that Princess rested and Crosses erected  viz Lincoln Newark Leicester Geddington Northampton StonyStratford Dunstable St Albans Waltham Cheapside Charingcross    On  Willoughby  Side of the Road is an Hillock call'd  Crosshill  where the Countrypeople observe an anniversary Festival  Willoughby  Brook plays in delightful Meanders along a Valley between Cornfields with a moderate Water unless raised by Rains Here several brass and silver Coins have been found and some of Gold The People have a Notion of  great Riches being hid underground and there is a vulgar Report that under one  Balk  or  Mere  that is Division between the ploughed Fields there is as much Money as would purchase the whole Lordship but they dare not dig they pretend for fear of Spirits Mosaic Pavements Coins Pothooks Fireshovels  c  have been also found  In  Willoughby  Town is an handsome Cross of one Stone five Yards long The Parliament Soldiers had ty'd Ropes about it to pull it down but the Vicar quench'd their Zeal with some strong Beer after having harangued them concerning its Innocence  At  Cossington  near the River  Wrek  is a vast Barrow Feet long broad high or near it very handsomely work'd up on the Sides and very steep It is call'd  Shipleyhill  from a great Captain of that Name who they say was here buried On the Top are several oblong doubled Trenches cut in the Turf where the Lads and Lasses of the adjacent Villages meet on  Eastermonday  to recreate themselves with Cakes and Ale  At  Erdborough  is a strong  Roman  Camp Feet long of a delightful Prospect Near it is a petrifying Spring  But I must not omit as I had like to have done the Town of  Wellingborough  in the County of  Northampton    It was a large wellbuilt and wellinhabited Town with a fine Church and Freeschool A dreadful Fire which happen'd here in  July  has made the Town still more beautiful tho' the Occasion was too melancholy to be wish'd for It began at a Dyer's House in the Town about two in the Afternoon and in the Space of Six Hours consumed near Houses besides Outhouses Barns Stables  c  amounting in the Whole to upwards of mostly in the South and East Parts of the Town The Wind being high and but little Water to be had  the Fire was so fierce and violent that it seem'd to break out at twenty Places at once and the Inhabitants were in such Confusion that but few of them had Time to save any Goods and many only the Cloaths on their Backs As it happen'd chiefly among the Trading Men and Farmers the Loss upon them was very heavy But it was a good deal alleviated by the signal Charity of the neighbouring Gentlemen and others which saved many of the poor Sufferers from perishing for Want  In the Month of  March  following this dreadful Fire another happen'd at  Findon  two Miles from  Wellingborough  which consumed Houses  From  Boughton  we went on to  Harborough  a good Markettown and great Thoroughfare intending to go forward to  Leicester  but Curiosity turn'd us West a little to see an old Town call'd  Lutterworth  famous for being the Birthplace of  John Wickliff  the first Preacher of the Reformation in  England  whose Disciples were afterwards called  Lollards    The Church was lately beautify'd and pav'd with a costly Pavement of chequer'd Stone and the Pews are new and every thing in it both in Church and Chancel except the Pulpit of thick OakPlanks sixsquare which is preserv'd on account of its being  Wickliff  's Pulpit  Being thus got a little out of our Way we turn'd West into the  Watlingstreet  Way at  Highcross  where the Foss crosses it and which I suppose occasion'd the Name leaving  Rugby  in  Warwickshire  a small Town noted only for a great Number of Butchers on the Southwest of us At this Cross we seem'd to be in the Centre and highest Ground of  England  for from hence Rivers run every way The  Fosse  went across the Backside of our Inn and so towards  Bath  Here are divers  Roman  Antiquities  its antient Appellation was  Benonis  The late Earl of  Denbigh  and the Gentlemen in the Neighbourhood erected here a Cross of an handsome Design but of mouldering Stone thro' the Deceit of the Architect It consists of four  Dorick  Columns regarding the four Roads with a gilded Globe and Cross attop upon a Sundial On two Sides between the four  Tuscan  Pillars which compose a sort of Pedestal are these Inscriptions  Vicinarum provinciarum Vervicensis scilicet Leicestrensis ornamenta proceres patriciique auspiciis illustrissimi Basilii comitis de Denbigh hanc columnam statuendam curaverunt in gratam pariter perpetuam memoriam Jani tandem a serenissima Anna clausi A D  MDCCXII  Thus translated  The Noblemen and Gentry Ornaments of the neighbouring Counties of  Warwick  and  Leicester  at the Instances of the Right Honourable  Basil  Earl of  Denbigh  have caused this Pillar to be erected in grateful as well as perpetual Remembrance of Peace at length restored by her Majesty Queen  Anne  in the Year of our Lord MDCCXII  The Inscription on the other Side runs thus  Si veterum Romanorum vestigia quaeras hic cernas viator Hic enim celeberrimae illorum viae militares sese mutuo secantes ad extremos usque Britanniae limites pr  currunt hic stativa sua habuerunt Vennones ad primum abhinc lapidem castra sua ad Stratam ad Fossam tumulum Claudius quidam cohortis praefectus habuisse videtur  Which may be thus rendered  If Traveller you search for the Footsteps of the antient  Romans  here you may behold them For  here their most celebrated military Ways crossing one another extend to the utmost Boundaries of  Britain  Here the  Vennones  kept their Quarters and at the Distance of one Mile from hence  Claudius  a certain Commander of a Cohort seems to have had a Camp towards the  The  Watlingstreet  simply call'd  The Street  by way of Eminence  Street  and towards the  Fosse  a Tomb  The  Watlingstreet  measuring from  Chester  thro'  London  and  Dover  makes a strait Line with  Rome  Which seems to have been so contriv'd by the great Founders that in travelling upon it they might have the Satisfaction of reflecting that they were going upon the Line which led to the Capital of the Empire  To proceed we kept the Streetway till we came into the  Leicester  Road which we followed East to  Hinkley  a Markettown situate on a Hill very pleasantly This Town is noted for a large handsome Church and a high SpireSteeple all of Stone in which is a Chime of excellent Bells  From hence we turn'd Northwest and came to  NunEaton  an ordinary manufacturing Town on the River  Anker  and then Northward to  Atherston  and so made a kind of serpentizing Tour of it along the Borders of the two Counties of  Warwick  and  Leicester  sometimes in one and sometimes in the other  Atherston  is a Markettown famous for a great CheeseFair on the th of  September  from whence the CheeseFactors carry the vast Quantities of Cheese they buy to  Sturbridge  Fair which begins about the same Time but holds much longer and here 'tis sold again for the Supply of the Counties of  Essex Suffolk  and  Norfolk    A little Northwest of  Atherston  stands  Polesworth  formerly a Markettown but since the Dissolution of a famous Nunnery which was there the Market was discontinued  From  Atherston  we turn'd East again into  Leicestershire  to see  Bosworthfield  famous for the great Battle which put an End to the Reign of  Richard  III and to the long and bloody Contention between the  Red Rose  and the  White  or the two Royal Houses of  York  and  Lancaster  which as Fame tells us had cost the Lives of Princes Earls and Dukes Noblemen Knights and Gentlemen and of the common People We view'd the Spot of Ground where the Battle was fought and at the Town they shew'd us several Pieces of Swords Heads of Lances Barbs of Arrows Pieces of PoleAxes and suchlike Instruments of Death which they said were found by the Country People in the several Grounds near the Place of Battle as they had occasion to dig or trench or plough up the Ground  Within three Miles of this Place is an antient Markettown of the same Name lying on a Hill in a very healthy and pleasant Air The Soil all round it is fruitful both for Tillage and Pasture  Hence I pass'd directly North to  Ashby de la Zouch  on the Skirts of  Derbyshire  a very pleasant Town lying between two Parks It consists but of one Street in which stands a pretty Stone Cross the Church is large and handsome and 'tis famous for four good HorseFairs in the Year  We then pass'd Southeast into  Leicestershire  The Earl of  Stamford  has a good old Huntingseat on this Side of the Country call'd  Bradgate  and a fine Park at  Grooby  but they were too much out of our Way so we came on thro' a fine Forest to  Leicester    Leicester  is an antient large and populous Town containing five Parishes 'tis the Capital of the County  of that Name and stands on the River  Soar  which rises not far from  Highcross  just mention'd It is a Borough and Corporation Town whereof the chief Magistrate is a Mayor who is assisted by a Recorder Aldermen and Commoncouncil Here are three Markets weekly well supply'd with Provisions A considerable Manufacture is carry'd on here and in several of the Markettowns around for weaving of Stockens by Frames and one would scarce think it possible so small an Article of Trade could imploy such Multitudes of People as it does for the whole County seems to be busy'd in it as also  Nottingham  and  Derby  of which hereafter  The County of  Leicester  is in part also taken up in Country Business more particularly in breeding and feeding Cattle Most of the Gentlemen are Grasiers and in some Places the Grasiers are so rich that they grow Gentlemen 'tis not an uncommon thing for Grasiers here to rent Farms from  l  to  l  a Year  The Sheep bred in this County and  Lincolnshire  which joins to it are without Comparison the largest and bear not only the greatest Weight of Flesh on their Bones but also the greatest Fleeces of Wool on their Backs of any Sheep in  England  and hence it is that these Counties becomes vast Magazines of Wool for the rest of the Nation Nor is the Wool less fine because of the great Quantity but as 'tis the longest  Staple  as the Clothiers call it so it is the finest Wool in the whole Island some few Places excepted such as  Leominster  in  Herefordshire  the South Downs in  Sussex  and such little Places where the Quantity is small and insignificant compar'd to this Part of the Country for the Sheepbreeding Country reaches from the River  Anker  on the Border of  Warwickshire  to the  Humber  at the farthest End of  Lincolnshire  which is near Miles in Length and from the Bank of  Trent  in  Lincolnshire  and  Leicestershire  to the Bank of  Ouse  bordering on  Bucks Bedford Cambridge  and  Huntingdon  Shires above Miles in Breadth  These are the Funds of Sheep which furnish the City of  London  with their large Mutton in such prodigious Quantities There are indeed a few Sheep of a large Breed which are brought up from  Romney Marsh  and the adjoining low Grounds in  Kent  and  Sussex  but they are few and indeed scarce worth naming compar'd to what are produc'd in these Counties  The Horses bred or rather fed here are the largest in  England  being generally the great black Coach and Drayhorses of which so great a Number are continually sent up to  London  that one would think so little a Spot as this of  Leicestershire  could not possibly produce so many But the adjoining Counties of  Northampton  and  Bedford  have of late come into the same Business The chief Supply however is from this County from whence the other Counties rather buy them and feed them up as Jockeys and Chapmen than breed them up from their Beginning  In the Southwest Part of the Country rise four considerable Secondrate Rivers which run every one a directly contrary Course in a most remarkable Manner  The  Avon  which runs by  Rugby  and goes away to  Warwick  Southwest  Of this River the Poet elegantly sings  Yet rolling  Avon  still maintains its Stream  Swell'd with the Glories of the  Roman  Name  Strange Pow'r of Fate  Unshaken  Moles must waste  While Things that ever  move  for ever  last  The  Soar  which runs by  Leicester  and goes away to the  Trent  Northwest  The  Anker  which runs by  NunEaton  and goes away to  Atherston  North and so on to  Tamworth  West  The  Welland  which runs by  Harborough  and goes away to  Stamford  Northeast  I ought not to omit observing that as the Town of  Leicester  was formerly very strong and well fortify'd being advantageously situated for that Purpose the River covering it half way about so it was again fortify'd in the late unhappy Wars and being garison'd by the Parliament Forces was assaulted by the Royalists who after an obstinate Defence took it Sword in Hand which occasion'd a terrible Slaughter They preserve here a most remarkable Piece of Antiquity being a Piece of  Mosaick  Work at the Bottom of a Cellar 'tis the Story of  Acteon  and his being kill'd by his own Hounds wrought as a Pavement in a most exquisite Manner the Stones are only of two Colours White and Brown and very small  The Castle here before it was dismantled was a prodigious Building It was the Court of the great  Henry  Duke of  Lancaster  who added to it Acres of Ground which he inclos'd with a very strong Wall of square Stone Feet high and called it his  Novum opus  vulgarly now the  Newark  where the best Houses in or near  Leicester  are and do still continue extraparochial The Hall and Kitchen of this Place remain still intire as Testimonies of the Grandeur of the Whole the former being so lofty and spacious that the Courts of Justice which in Assizetime are held there are at such a Distance as to give no Disturbance to one another There are several Gateways to enter this Palace and that which faces the East has an Arch that is deemed a curious Piece of Architecture over which in the Tower is kept the Magazine for the Militia of the County  Beneath this Castle was a very fair Collegiate Hospital in the Church whereof  Henry  Earl of  Lancaster  and  Henry  his Son the first Duke of it were bury'd the Hospital was built by the Duke in his old Age and appropriated for the Maintenance of poor People in which also he placed a Dean and twelve Canons Prebendaries with as many Vicars and other Ministers and ten able Women to serve and assist the Poor and Weak This with Divine Service therein doth in some measure still subsist by certain Stipends paid out of the Duchy of  Lancaster  Another Hospital built by Sir  William Wigston  in the Reign of King  Henry  VIII is in a very flourishing Condition there  Leicester  is the  Ratae Coritanorum  of the  Romans  The Trace of the  Roman  Wall is discoverable without Difficulty especially in the Gardens about  Senvygate  with a Ditch which is very visible This was repair'd by  Edelfleda  a noble  Saxon  Lady in the Year The old Work call'd  Jewrywall  is composed of Ragstone and  Roman  Brick  Not far off is a Place call'd  Holybones  where abundance of Bones of Oxen have been dug up which were the Remains of the  Roman  Sacrifices  At  Leicester  many  Roman  Coins are found a Pot full of them was dug up at the Entrance into  Whitefriers  There are also many great Foundations At St  Mary de Pree  's Abbey a Body was dug up supposed to be Cardinal  Wolsey  's  Since its Dissolution it has been made a Dwellinghouse which has nothing left but the naked Walls and the Spot of the Abbey is turned into a Garden The only thing worth seeing in it is a pleasant Terracewalk supported by an embattled Wall with Lunets hanging over the River and shaded with Trees  In the Time of the  Saxons St Margaret  's Church was an episcopal See and was very fine Here say some King  Richard  III was buried  Half a Mile Southward from  Leicester  upon the Edge of the Meadows is a long Ditch call'd  Rawdikes  on the Banks of which according to Tradition King  Charles  I stood to behold the Storm of the Town That Prince lay at the Vicaragehouse at  Elston    Southeast of  Leicester  lies  Billesden  a Markettown of no Note and further South still is  Hallaton  another Town noted for its Poverty in the midst of a rich Soil  The  Fosseway  leads from hence through the Northwest Part of this County but entering  Nottinghamshire  it inclines Northeast through the Vale of  Belvoir  or as it is commonly call'd of  Bever  to  Newark  In all this long Tract we pass through a rich and fertile Country having in our Coast Northeastward the noble River  Trent  for twenty Miles together often in our View  But some Miles North of  Leicester  the River  Wrek  which comes from the Northeast and the  Stour  which runs Northwest form a kind of Y the  Stour  from  Leicester  Southward making the Tail In the Course lastmentioned we passed through  Montsorrel  and  Loughborough  both Markettowns lying on the  Fosse  which runs nearly parallel with the  Stour  and makes one Side of the Y The first is situate under a great Eminence and has a good Stone Bridge over the  Stour  and the other is seated among rich Meadowground and is a fine agreeable Town And on the  Wrek  which makes the other Side of the Y stand  Melton Mowbray  a large wellbuilt considerable Markettown situate in a fertile Soil almost surrounded with a little River call'd the  Eye  over which it has two fine Bridges and also  Waltham on the Would    i e  on the Downs which is but a mean Markettown  Belvoircastle  standing within  Lincolnshire  but on the Edge of  Leicestershire  is a truly noble Situation  tho' on a very high Precipice 'tis the antient Seat of the Dukes of  Rutland  a Family risen by just Degrees to an immense Height both of Honour and Wealth I shall mention the House again in my Return out of  Lincolnshire    Bingham  in  Nottinghamshire  lying in our Way to  Newark  we pass'd through it It is but a small Markettown but is noted for a Parsonage of great Value  At  Newark  one can hardly see without Regret the Ruins of that famous Castle which through all the civil War in  England  kept a strong Garison for the King to the last and so cut off the greatest Pass into the North that is in the whole Kingdom nor was it ever taken 'till the King press'd by the Calamity of his Affairs put himself into the Hands of the  Scots  Army which lay before it and then commanded the Governor to deliver it up after which it was demolish'd that the great Road might lie open and free and it remains in Rubbish to this Day  The Castle was built here by  Alexander  Bishop of  Lincoln  in the Reign of King  Stephen  and the Town took its Name from that New Work  This Town was certainly rais'd from the neighbouring  Roman  Cities and has been wall'd about with their Remains The Northern Gate is composed of Stones seemingly of a  Roman  Cut and perhaps they had a Town here for many Antiquities are found about it Here are two fine Stone Crosses A Gentleman digging to plant some Tree by the  Fosse  Road Side discover'd four Urns in a strait Line and at equal Distances in one of which was a brass  Lar  or HousholdGod an Inch and half long but much consum'd by Rust  Newark  is a very handsome wellbuilt Town situate on the  Trent  under the Government of a Mayor and Aldermen The Marketplace is a  noble Square and the Church is large and spacious with a curious Spire which were not  Grantham  so near might pass for the finest and highest in all this Part of  England  The  Trent  divides itself here and makes an Island and the Bridges lead just to the Foot of the Castle Wall so that while this Place was in the Hands of any Party as I have before hinted there was no Travelling but by their Leave but all the Travelling into the North at that Time was by  Nottingham  Bridge  I am Sir yours c  The END of the SECOND
