 A SERMON PREACHED BEFORE THE Honourable Trustees For Establishing the Colony of  GEORGIA  in AMERICA AND THE Associates of the late Rev Dr BRAY AT THEIR ANNIVERSARY MEETING  March  IN THE Parish Church of St MARGARET WESTMINSTER  By  THOMAS FRANCKLIN  M A Fellow of  Trinity College  CAMBRIDGE  Publish'd at the Desire of the  Trustees  and  Associates  LONDON  Printed for R FRANCKLIN in  Russelstreet CoventGarden  MDCCL  GAL vi ix  Let us not be weary in welldoing for in due Season we shall reap if we faint not  AS the chief Purport and Design of the holy Apostle thoughout his Epistle to the  Galatians  was to exhort his Fellowlabourers in the Vineyard of  Christ  to a Continuance in welldoing to a steady Zeal and Perseverance in the great and important Business assign'd to their Care he takes Occasion in the Conclusion of it to put them in Mind of that grand Point on which their Success must in a great Measure depend to enforce the Necessity of a firm and unalterable Resolution and at the same Time to intimate to them the Advantages which wou'd naturally flow from such a Conduct  Let us not  says he  be weary in welldoing for in due Season we shall reap if we faint not  St  Paul  who was no Stranger to human Nature and all its Infirmities who knew how Men are for the most Part guided by their Hopes and Fears who knew how arduous a Task they had engaged in who probably knew also that they had been persecuted and oppress'd and were perhaps greatly dispirited and cast down endeavours to comfort and support them by a Promise of better Success and a strong Assurance of future Reward  we shall reap  says he  in due Season if we faint not  As the Mind of Man is ever fluctuating and inconstant fond of Novelty and impatient of Confinement as good Intents and Dispositions come upon us as it were but by Starts and Sallies and even in the best of us are seldom of long Duration no Caution can be more necessary than that given in the Text nor any stronger Motive to induce us to a Compliance with it than that which is there annex'd  It is with great Truth observed of all human Pleasures that the Satisfaction lies more in the Pursuit than in the Enjoyment of them The Sport is in the Chace and not the Game and thus it is in most of our Actions Whilst we have Novelty to delight us we feel neither Fatigue nor Satiety but when we have got up the Hill and view'd the whole Prospect our Eyes begin to wander after fresh Objects Desire grows languid and something else is  wanting to revive and set it at Work again How many noble and excellent Designs calculated to promote the Welfare of Society have been thrown aside merely through Listlessness and want of Perseverance It is much easier to begin than to continue in any good and praiseworthy Undertaking Nothing doth in Reality so much destroy the Credit of Morality as Indolence and Wavering nothing doth so much promote and honour it as Steadiness and Resolution But I know not how it is Vice and Folly have gain'd over Industry to their Party and all the Endeavours of Reason and Religion to render Virtue habitual are ineffectual How soon do Men faint in the Race of true Glory how indefatigable are they in the Pursuit of false how seldom weary of doing ill how languid in Actions of Goodness or Beneficence The  Feet of the malicious  and revengeful are slow to serve the wretched but  swift to shed Blood  Evil Doers are resolute active vigilant while the Followers of Good want perpetual Monitors to awaken and stimulate them There is always a  Lion in the Path  to obstruct them Every Obstacle alarms every Disappointment checks every Danger throws them into Doubt Diffidence and Despair How disgraceful is it to the Cause of Truth that the Advocates for Falsehood should so far exceed them in Zeal and Alacrity and that the Resolution and Firmness which would  throw so great a Lustre on Virtue and Religion should be listed in the Service of Vice and Debauchery Shall we never be persuaded to make that which is our Interest and Duty our Pleasure also and our Happiness Shall not all those who are already engaged resolve to continue in welldoing Let us rest assured we shall meet with a Recompence of Reward that  we shall  certainly  reap if we faint not  Let this then inspire us with fresh Vigour and reanimate us in the noble Struggle for Victory  Doubtless the best and most effectual Method of carrying on great and laudable Undertakings is by the Union and Cement of Society by various Lines all tending to one great Center held together by Charity the Bond of all Virtues Nothing can bestow truer Satisfaction on a benevolent Mind than to reflect on the many pious and useful Designs which have of late Years been promoted by collective P  dies of Men amongst us and greater things we tr  st may yet be done Few indeed in these our Day  are the Wise and Good and yet small and inconsiderable as is their Number were they once heartily to unite in the Cause of Piety and Virtue  Righteousness and Peace might once more kiss each other  and the Triumph over Vice and Irreligion be an easy and a glorious Conquest  To prepare the Way for this Triumph we are here on this Day assembled to exhort one another in the Continuance of welldoing to return our hearty and unfeigned Thanks to God for the good Success we have already met with and to call down a Blessing on our Endeavours an annual Solemnity establish'd by and very consonant with the Piety and Goodness of Men engaged in so noble and useful an Undertaking a Solemnity which it were to be wish'd might be observed by all who shall at any Time enter into Pursuits of the like Nature  The Foundation of Colonies is perhaps of all Charities the most noble and extensive as it promotes both public Welfare and private Utility and whilst it brings Honour and Plenty to the whole Body secures at the same Time the Peace Safety and Happiness of the Individual it is not narrow and circumscribed but embraces the whole Range of social Duties and takes in our Duty to God to our Country and to our Kind  What the Psalmist says of Children may I think with great Propriety be applied to these Establishments  They are like the Arrows in the Hand of the Giant happy is  that King  who hath his Quiver full of them  they give Delight to his Friends and Terror to his Enemies and serve like burnish'd  Armour to the Warrior both to adorn and to defend  Such as promote and encourage these glorious Undertakings are true  Christians  far better  Christians  than all the modern Pretenders to Inspiration and Apostleship which have sprung up amongst us These Deeds and these Men will be remember'd when the Zeal of Fools and the Bigotry of Enthusiasts shall be forgotten These are the true Patriots and Lovers of their Country who are thus anxious for her Glory thus active for her Interest  who send forth her Fame unto all Lands and her Words unto the Ends of the World  Amongst these  true Christians  and true Patriots the Establishers of  Georgia  claim our highest Veneration Esteem and Gratitude a Colony which was for a long Time cherish'd and encouraged with most amazing Warmth and Alacrity but though the Legislature doth continue to encourage it by constant Supplies and tho' those Supplies are fairly and justly appropriated by the Trustees to the Uses for which they are granted yet whether it be that public Charity hath since emptied itself into other Channels whether as I before observed the Love of Novelty hath diverted it whether a false Notion may have prevailed that it doth not stand in Need of any farther Assistance to which ever Cause we must attribute it certain it is it  doth not at present so much engross the public Care and Concern as it once did or as it deserves  It is to be hoped we are not grown  weary in welldoing  It has suffered from us and should be comforted it has merited from and should be rewarded by us  On it's Trade and Commerce on it's Ports and Havens the Wealth and Safety of a Nation situated as ours is must principally depend How useful  Georgia  hath already been in all these Respects how much more so it may still be render'd hath already been made sufficiently evident  Undeniable it is and must be that every Argument which hath been at any Time alledged in Favour of this Colony will at this Time recur to us with double Force whether we consider it in a civil or in a religious Light  When we reflect on the miserable State of Servitude and Dependence in which so many amongst us are involved the Penury of some the Afflictions of others and at the same Time call to Mind that there is a Haven of Rest open to them a Place where they may be assured of Maintenance and Support where those Talents and Accomplishments which might perhaps here lie undiscover'd or undistinguish'd would be highly valued and esteem'd when we consider that it is thus in the Power of Men to exchange Want and Sorrow for  Ease and Affluence Infamy for Reputation and Slavery for Freedom is it not Matter of Astonishment they should yet prefer Misery to Happiness and be in love with Ruin Poverty and Destruction But there are Thousands amongst us of the low and illiterate especially who had rather beg and starve here than flourish any where else Wretches who talk with Fear and Trembling of the Misery of quitting Friends and Home when at the same Time it may be they have neither Home nor Friends to leave  Prejudices against Places Things or Persons without Reason or Judgment to countenance them are among the most pernicious Weaknesses of our Nature they shew a foolish cowardly Diffidence of ourselves a blameable not to say an impious distrust of our Creator as if his Bounty could not supply our Wants in every Climate his right Hand guide and defend us in every Situation and Circumstance of Life  But the Idle who are here and will not go over have another Reason also and that is that the Idle who were there before did not like it and if the Dissolute and Slothful have left the Province as many of them have so much the better the Idle in a  Colony  like Cowards in an Army are but a dead Weight and an Incumbrance the Business is much better carried on without  them If the Members be rotten and corrupt it is better they should be sever'd from the Body lest they infect and mortify it  Such as remain there will in all Probability be more industrious and serviceable their Fidelity and Perseverance stand in a stronger Point of Light and seem in a more particular Manner to demand your Gratitude towards them  But let us consider  Georgia  in a religious Light Consider it as a Shelter from the Tyranny of Bigots and Enthusiasts and as a Door of Knowlege to the unenlighten'd  Barbarian  as well in Regard to those who fly from a false Religion as those who are ignorant of the true Thanks be to God we are not persecuted we are under no Fear of Axes Faggots and an Inquisition and all our easy Task is to  love Mercy  and  walk humbly with our God  If we do  love Mercy  then here we may shew it if we ourselves would  walk humbly with our God  let us give others an Opportunity of doing so too Persecution hath already driven many thither who deserved a better Fate It is remarked to the Honour of the  Saltzburghers  that they live together in the utmost Harmony and Happiness an amiable Copy of the first Ages of the World in  godly Love and mutual Charity one towards another  in that Simplicity of Life and Manners so rarely to be met with in any Age so very seldom  in our own This is furely a State which Kings might envy them They have Reason to bless the Hand which persecuted them and to look on their Enemies who drove them to such an Asylum as their best Friends and Benefactors  But what shall we say to the great Advantages which may arise from spreading the Gospeldoctrine among the neighbouring  Indians  Can there be an Employment worthier a good Man an Employment capable of imparting more Pleasure and Satisfaction to a right Mind than that of cultivating and improving the human Soul to soften and refine the Manners to tame by gentle Methods the Wildness of the Savage and humanize him into a social and benevolent Being to be Instruments in the Hands of God of saving many Souls from Death to be the Means of propagating our holy Religion among those who  have no Knowlege of her Laws  that we may all become  one Flock under one Shepherd  this is surely a most noble and most desirable Employment To this Purpose some are set apart and to this every one as far as in him lies will it is hoped gladly contribute and if they are rightly taught and instructed by us if we  sow unto them spiritual Things we shall reap their temporal Things  they will think no Labour too great no Toil too irksome to reward those who have thus open'd their Minds and brought them from the  Darkness of Paganism and Idolatry to the Knowlege of God and of his Son Jesus Christ  Surely if there were no other Inducement this would be sufficient to prevent our growing weary The Industry of  Rome  in making Proselytes has long been a Reproach to us their Warmth and Resolution make our cold Remissness still more inexcusable  It is too common among the Potentates of the Earth to establish Colonies by Force and Violence to send out Men with Orders to seize on the first convenient Spot and take Possession of it after putting to Death all the wretched Inhabitants This we know has been done but  Georgia  was not thus establish'd no Property was invaded no Blood spilt we did not ravage or destroy for it the same Methods which were made Use of in the Acquisition were also follow'd when we were settled in it and it was originally design'd that there should be no such Thing as Slavery in  Georgia  To this End a general Equality was proposed and acquiesced in every Man's Estate was limited and no one suffer'd by Means of exorbitant Power or greater Extent of Possessions to lord it over or insult his Fellowlabourers and Brothers of the Community  It was not therefore without great Concern that the  Trustees  found themselves under the Necessity  of introducing Negroslaves into the  Colony  but in this Particular as in all others they have at the same Time acted with the utmost Prudence and Humanity Such Regulations are already made as will greatly tend to promote the Glory of God and the Good of our Country Care has been taken to check the Insolence of Power to prevent all severe Treatment all Acts of Violence or Oppression that if these unhappy Beings must eat the Bread of Slavery they shall at least eat it in Peace and Quiet that their Chains may not gall them that their  Yoke may be easy and their Burthen light  and that  their Masters shall  as St  Paul  says  give unto their Servants that which is just and equal knowing that they also have a Master in Heaven  To treat our Fellowcreatures those who partake of the same Nature with us Sons of one common Lord and Father as Aliens and Illegitimate to take Advantage of any casual Superiority either of bodily or mental Powers to triumph over and insult them is surely unworthy of us as Men and a Disgrace to us as  Christians  Whilst on the other Hand toenlarge and refine their Souls to call them from a State of Anarchy and Confusion to Order and Harmony to the Benefits of mutual Converse and all the protected Joys of Society and above all to make them Partakers with us of  the joyful Hope of another and better World This is an Ambition worthy of us this has been your Ambition may it be crowned with Success  The Negroes in  Georgia  by your late Orders will be made useful not dangerous Subjects Servants but not Slaves dependent but not miserable Beings and it is hoped an Example so truly noble and Praiseworthy will be followed by the rest of our  Colonies  that they also will act with Humanity and Tenderness to all those who are in Subjection under them that if we call them in to give us their Labour we shall not grudge them in Return Knowlege and Instruction that if they are forced to live among  Christians  Care will be taken that they may themselves in Time become so that if we use their Bodies for our Support and Happiness their Souls may be refreshed and that for their Service here to us we may bestow on them by our Instructions the glorious Opportunity of securing to themselves eternal Happiness hereafter  Let us not  then  be weary in welldoing  There is doubtless now more Encouragement for all that are willing and ready to go there than there ever yet could be The Way is become smooth and passable and every Obstacle removed which could alarm the Timid or terrify the Bold the Country rendered more healthful and more fertile  Friends ready to embrace and assist all who will visit them  Whatever Disappointment the  Colony  may have met with whatever Discouragements may have prejudiced it those to whose Care it was committed are intirely Blameless The  honourable Trustees  have acted always with Integrity and Uprightness with the utmost Care and Assiduity and have done all that Men could to support and encourage this good Work and have the Testimony withal of a good Conscience to inform them that in this as in all other Things when they have done what  they can  they have done what  they ought  But after all national Undertakings a Nation must support To the Public therefore we must appeal for Succour if we stand in need of it  Now that  God  as the  Psalmist  says  has made Peace within our Borders and filled us with the Flower of Wheat  now that  the Plougher plougheth in hope  now that the Harvest is ready to be gathered in now let the Sun of Beneficence shine forth upon it We have  sowed in Tears  but we shall  reap in Joy  We have as the Apostle says  been troubled on every side  Though perplexed we need not be in Despair We have been  persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroy'd  We may say with the  Children of Dan we have seen the Land and behold it is very good be not  slothful therefore to go and poss  unto a Place that is secure wh  of any Thing that is in the Earth  Georgia  need not now be appren  frequent Inroads of her  Spanish  Enemies  with redoubled Ardour and Industry pur  Work The Mulberrytree will flourish unde  Hand and the Vine yield her Fruits of Increa  and there shall be  no noise and complaining in her Streets  Nothing but a supply of able Hands is wanting to establish a Manufacture there which would be of the highest Service to  Great Britain  as the Produce is affirmed to be of at least equal Value and Goodness with that of any other Country Why should we be obliged to any of them or pay an exorbitant Price for what we may so easily draw from ourselves unless we have indeed more Riches than we know what to do with which I fear at present is not the Case  Let us not then faint  for in due Season  we shall reap  Look upon the People now there I beseech you as young and tender Plants whom ye took from a Soil to them barren and desart and transplanted to a fairer and more fertile Spot Let them not after all your Toil for want of Moisture and Nourishment at last wither and decay Let us not like Prodigals and Spendthrifts lay the Foundation only of so noble and magnificent a  goodly Edifice and then  it for others to inhabit or  ourage our Industry but let it not  miss or lull us into a fatal Security  Lot because we may not stand so much in  of  Georgia  as a Barrier neglect it as a Pro  but rather in Peace be ready for War raise proper Forts and Bulwarks and while the Waves are still and the Sky serene prepare against a Storm  Let us hope that no Jealousy or Animosity of the  neighbouring Colonies  will hurt us but rather trust they will by kind Offices repay that Succour which they have received from this and in Return for the Support and Defence which  Georgia  has afforded them assist and patronize her To her their own Safety and Success has been greatly owing Let us hope they will not be ungrateful  Put not away therefore your Confidence God my Brethren will doubtless raise up Friends to this as he doth to every great and good Work All that are Friends to  England  to Liberty and to Virtue are our Friends and  Georgia  can have no Enemies but the Enemies of public Spirit the Foes of Religion and of Mankind May her Manufactures and her Subjects increase may her own  Works  as the wise Man says  praise her in the Gate  May  this truly great and glorious Undertaking  Day with fresh Encouragement may  Suggestions  it no Coldness or  obstruct its Succ  May this  infant  such it still is prove a pious an obedient  useful Offspring and  England  be always  what it always hath been a kind a tender  an indulgent Parent May those to whose Car  is so greatly indebted be thanked for their Bene  and reap such Reward of th  ir Integrity R  ghtness and truly Christian Zeal then  hey d  serve the Praise of all good Men here the Recompence of a gracious and merciful God hereafter  May not only our own Nation but all our Friends reap the Advantage of it May the whole World be benefitted by the Progress of our mo  holy Religion which the Establishment of  Colony  will we trust greatly promote Ma  blessed Spirit of that pious Man now with  whose Associates ye are look down with Plea  on your Endeavours to render his glorious Design effectual  that the Earth may be full of the Knowlege of the Lord  that the Religion of  Christ  may be as extensive as was his Goodness as is and ev  will be his Beneficence  Thee lastly then O gracious and Almighty God the Source of all Happiness the only Giver of go  d  ee let us humbly address and beg  our Labours grant us O Lord thy  Support thy Arm  thy right  guide and direct us  Satisfy us with thy  and that soon give Peace and Joy and  these our Days Comfort us again after the  that thou hast plagued us and for the Years
