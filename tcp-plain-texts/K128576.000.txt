 TO THE NOBLEMEN GENTLEMEN AND Proprietors of Lands in Scotland and Inhabitants at large  SCOTLAND as a part of the united kingdoms altho' having a right to the same protection from Government with its sister kingdom  England  yet labours under some hardships and even imposed by Act of Parliament which the people of  England  know nothing about And these are Burrow duties known by the name of  imposts  on  Malt Liquors  which have of late years spread themselves as a plague over the face of this country They began first in the capital of the kingdom in the year an aera when few classes of men in this country knew their rights and privileges as subjects or if they had been as well understood as at present were unacquainted with the mode of application to parliament all of which circumstances contributed to the Bill in fa∣vours of the town of  Edinburgh  passing without op∣position imposing a duty of  two pennies Scots  on the pint of all  malt liquors  brewed tap'd or vended with∣in  the privileges of said city From which not only the Burrows and towns of consequence but every petty town have taken the hint and have succes∣sively applied to Parliament for similar Acts and is now become almost an universal tax on this coun∣try  viz  the towns of  Edinburgh Glasgow Dundee Dunbar Kelso Arbroath Dalkeith Prestonpans Boness Paisley Portglasgow Greenock  c and there is great reason to believe that private gentle∣men who have the smallest villages situated on na∣vigable rivers and who are not yet arrived at such a degree of consequence as to have a magistrate of any kind allured by the surprising revenue which this tax raises intend applying to Parliament for grants of the same nature and Parliament by no opposition hav∣ing ever been made have overlooked them as un∣connected either with the revenue the landed in∣terest or the welfare of the people in general but which are connected with all these three to a degree of more consequence than is in general understood or attended to  It is the universal complaint that the  malt liquors  of  Scotland  particularly  porter  and  pale malt liquors  are not equal in quality to that brewed in  London  and the other towns in  England  but it ceases to be a matter of any wonder when the Public are informed that the  malt liquors  of  Scotland  is loaded with  per cent  of the King's excise in  impost  payable to royal borrows and other smaller towns  The trifling opinion which the country entertains of  two pennies Scots  and mankind in general of the fractions of a penny has made this oppressive tax pass unnoticed not only by parliament but by the landed interest of this country both of whom ought to have set themselves in opposition to so partial and oppressive a burthen on this part of the kingdom Trifling as  two pennies Scots  may appear when taken by the pint it is no less than s sterling on every gallons which is of the whole value of  malt liquor  at s  per  gallon but burthensome and oppressive as this must appear to every considerate person it is enormous when considered as a tax added to the ex∣cise which is so heavy already that when Lord North in the year laid  per cent  on the amount of the customs and excise out of compassion to the laborious part of the nation who are the consumers of  malt liquors  he exempted the brewery in both kingdoms and in his subsequent taxes he has still  paid such an attention to the brewery no doubt from a consciousness of its not being able to bear more that he has all along exempted it and even in the additional taxes on the  malt  he provided a drawback of d  per  barrel on all  malt liquor  above the de∣nomination of  small beer  and d  per  barrel on this last species in lieu of the additional duty on the  malt  and altho' this drawback is not an exact equivalent for the additional duty on the  malt  yet it is plain he meant it to be so according to the best of his judg∣ment and the information he had  For every ⅔ Gallons Scots of all strong ale which is equal to a barrel of Gallons Winchester measure the neat Excise  L    ½  For every ⅔ Gallons Scots of small Beer Do      ¼     L    ¼    For the above two barrels of  malt liquor  which is ⅓ gallons the brewer in  Scotland  pays s d⅓ of  im∣post  which every body will find that will take the trouble of calculating is upon s d the amount of the excise on a barrel of  porter  and a barrel of  small beer  no less than within the meerest trifle of  per cent  upon the amount of the duty taken com∣plexly and on  small beer  is no less than the exact double duty What would the Noblemen and Gen∣tlemen  and Inhabitants of  Scotland  say were Govern∣ment to lay a double tax or even  per cent  on the  malt liquor  of Scotland more than in England The very mention of it must strike every person of any consideration with astonishment how any species of manufacture could support such a load of taxes especially when it is considered that the price of no kind of  malt liquor  has been raised in Scotland not∣withstanding of this enormous local tax The fact is that at the time the  impost  was imposed the brewers found themselves in possession of a pretty good trade from the very low price of materials at that time and having no denomination of money equivolent to  two pennies  Scots the amount of the tax and not being allowed by the law to add it to the price of the pint or gallon without exposing themselves to be charged the next highest duty  viz strong ale  were under the necessity in order to indemnify themselves of taking the value of the tax which is one ninth out of the quality of the liquor  Every body will see what a debasement of the li∣quor would ensue by taking the ninth part of malt out of the quality to this debasement of the liquor must be attributed the decrease of the brewing busi∣ness  in Scotland which is evidently demonstrated by the decrease of the malt tax as any body may be in∣formed of by appyling to the Excise Office at Edin∣burgh This debasement of the liquor does not operate in a common and ordinary proportion on the interest of the country but in a threefold proportion It is not only the loss of part of the consumption of the barley to the landed interest and to the farmer but also part of the revenue of the malt tax to Go∣vernment besides this debasement of the  malt liquor  makes at the most moderate calculation less con∣sumption of the liquor that is brewed and de∣crease of quantity of malt is =¼ nearly being only part less so that it is plain this tax does not operate to the prejudice of the revenue as but as ¼ decrease on the revenue of  malt  likewise not as but as ¼ decrease of barley to the prejudice of the landed interest  This tax in proportion as it decreases the revenue of the  malt  tax it decreases the revenue of the ex∣cise on the ale in the proportion of one ninth less con∣sumed than would have been if this tax had not taken place so that it affects government in no less a pro∣portion than or ⅓ loss on the revenue of excise in Scotland  The author might have availed himself of Mr Arnot's is history of Edinburgh  page  for the in∣contestible evidence of the above facts who had full access to the records of the city wherein he shows that in the year at or after the time that the town obtained an act extending the impost to the parishes of St  Cuthbert  's  Canongate South  and  North Leiths  that the revenue of the impost paid to the town of  Edinburgh  was no less a sum annually in the year    L                                      During the period betwixt  first act the town of Edinburgh procured for levying an impost which was confined to the city alone the impost did not exceed  l  annually because as soon as the act took place the greatest part of the brewers either removed out of the town or settled in the invirons of the city which included the above parishes The a∣mount of this noble income of  l    s  shews in the most forcible manner the great extent and flourishing state of the brewing business at said period For at d every gallons equal to an English barrel of    Winchester  gallons it is barrels and in the year a period not seven years ago the num∣ber of barrels brewed and consequently that paid revenue to government for the town of  Edinburgh  takes the charge of the impost from the gaugers re∣turn was no more than barrels so that there is an annual decrease comparing these two periods to∣gether of barrels and suppposing them all  two penny ale  and at the old duty of s  per  barrel is no less a sum than an annual loss to Government of  l  s on the excise only for the presumption is that the revenue on the brewery would not have fallen short of the above quantity had the  impost act  not taken place as the nation instead of a retrograde motion toward  ension has been advancing since that period  viz  the year in a rapid progress to wealth and opulence and therefore no other good cause can be assigned for the decrease of the revenue on this article but the debasement of the liquor which took place in consequence thereof On the same principle the  malt duty  has likewise fallen short in proportion for barrels the amount of the quantity brewed in the year in the city of  Edin∣burgh  allowing six bushels  Winchester  measure to e∣very ¼ barrels or gallons of  two penny  will take  bushels which at ½  per  bushel the duty exigible till the year amounts to  l    s  In that year the impost revenue of the town of Edin∣burgh had fallen to barrels only which at the above calculation  viz  six bushels to every ¼ barrels produces bushels at ½ is     Bushels  l      Malt made in Edinburgh in  at ½        Ditto    ditto                   By the above calculation there is lost annually on the  ale duty  l      On the  malt duty  annually as above        Lost to the country on the reve        This enormous sum is not all the loss that the country has sustained by this absurd tax for the landed in∣terest has lost the consumption of bolls of barley at  s per  boll a very moderate medium price is the immense sum annually of  l      Lost annually  l      If the principle of these calculations is founded on right reason and common sense this country has lost betwixt and the present period years the enormous sum of  l    Few instances perhaps have occurred that shews in a more forcible light the dangerous tendency of ad∣mitting the most trifling tax to be levied on a com∣mon necessary of life This estimation the author hopes will be thought very moderate when it is considered that additional duties have been laid on both  malt  and  ale  and the price of materials have been annually advancing during the above period all of which shews that the author's supposition of less consumption of ale in consequence of the impost tax taking place in this country from which all these calculations  taken  Are too too well founded  more especially when it is considered that the above enor∣mous sum has been lost to the country on the con∣sumption of Edinburgh alone exclusive of all the other parts of Scotland  The author hopes what he has said will meet the attention of the Noblemen and Gentlemen Lords of Council and Session Barons of Exchequer and Commissioners of Customs and Excise as likewise the worthy Manufacturers and useful Mechanic and  Labourer who are also interested that this oppressive tax should be abolished in Scotland to put them on a footing with their brethren manufacturers and la∣bourers in England as also householders of all de∣nominations whose interest it is to have as in Eng∣land a nourishing sound and wholesome malt liquor  The  impost acts  have the effect of a monoply against the inhabitants of every town where it is established in loading with an additional tax one of the com∣modities of life and prevents people at a distance from relieving them by serving them better and cheaper than their own brewers either can or choose to do it being the interest of every community to open the most free communication for all sorts of provisions and therefore it is their interest to op∣pose all such Acts  In short it is the interest of the community at large and of the inhabitants of towns in particular to guard against magistrates introducing by act of par∣liament and without their own consent any species of taxation and carefully watching over any bill in its progress through the House of Commons and the author of this address takes the liberty to advise the inhabitants of corporated towns in all cases where magistrates propose getting new acts of parliament  to chuse a committee of the most worthy and re∣spectful of their number unconnected with the council to watch over the steps the magistrates and council take in such a piece of business and that they would always employ a council at law to take care of their interest in the House of Commons the ex∣pence of which would be a mere trifle But of all the ranks of men in the community he would advise the brewers in Scotland at large to be upon their guard when any revenue laws are applied for more especially those whose avowed purpose is to subject them alone to a tax exclusive of the rest of the inha∣bitants as all impost taxes on malt liquor aretaxes to the prejudice of the revenue the landed interest and the ruin of a respectable rank of citizens who are subjected  partial local and unequal tax which their brethren the brewers of England know no∣thing about  It has been said and is still averred by the abettors of this tax that it is the inhabitants that pay the tax and not the brewers and as this doctrine is industri∣ously propagated among the inhabitants of the diffe∣rent towns the author begs the reader's indulgence until he explodes this magisterial doctrine calculated  to mislead the well meaning citizen who would spurn the idea of contributing by his consent to load his neighbour and fellowcitizen with a burthensome and oppressive tax of which he himself bears no part It is well known that twopenny ale at the Union of the two kingdoms was sold at twopence the Scots pint the brewer had then the malt  per Cent  cheaper than at present and yet every body knows that the twopenny ale all over Scotland is sold at the same price at this very moment If this is the fact the author begs the favour that the advocates for this impost tax will say where the impost which is ⅙ of a penny is added to the price But however trifling it appears on the pint it is ⅓ of a penny on the gal∣lon and on a barrel of  chester mea∣sure or twelve Scots gallons is d which is the exact duty of excise on small beer and consequently  small beer in Scotland  pays exactly double duty of what it is charged with in England It is in this way say the trifling denomination of the tax that the iniquity and oppression of it has escaped the notice of the legislature and all good citizens And unless the inhabitants at large pay the tax where is the equity of charging a few individuals as much as all the in∣habitants besides for the ornamenting of any town  whatever And what is more extraordinary per∣haps those very people who pay this oppressive tax do not reside within the precincts of the town as is the case in many places having an impost In short every view you take of this tax it is fraught with absurdity  It is much to the honour of this country at the present period that a spirit of patriotism prevails among the Noblemen and Gentlemen to promote the manufactures of their own country which if followed out with steadiness and perseverance will raise this country to a degree of opulence unknown to former ages It is therefore from them we are to expect  pport in opposition to all our oppressions and as there never was at any period a Prime Minister who seemed to be more the friend of the manufacturer or lower class of the people we have every reason to expect that he will oppose attempts that are prejudicial to them in any shape provided the representatives in parliament from Scotland show a truly spirited zeal for the public welfare It is to them we have to look for redress and as they are mostly men of patriotic principles we cannot entertain a doubt but they will be the  guardians of our interest The author in the firm persuasion that the Legislature and Public at large will unite in redressing the evil complained of  REMAINS Their most obedient humble servant JOHN CUNNINGHAM Sen  r    BREWER GREENOCK
