 A DESCRIPTIVE ACCOUNT OF THE ISLANDS LATELY DISCOVERED IN THE SOUTHSEAS  Giving a full Detail of the present State of the Inhabitants their Government Religion Language Manners Customs c c c from the first Discovery to the present Time  Carefully collected digested and systematically arranged By the Reverend DR JOHN TRUSLER From MENDANA DE QUIROS SCHOUTEN TASMAN DALRYMPLE BOUGANVILLE BYRON CARTERET WALLIS HAWKESWORTH PARKINSON FOURNEAUX FORSTER COOK and others  With some Account of the Country of CAMCHATCA A late Discovery of the RUSSIANS  LONDON PRINTED FOR THE AUTHOR AND SOLD BY R BALDWIN PATERNOSTERROW  THE PREFACE  THE several voyages that have been made into the South Seas have been undertaken with the patronage of different states in order to find out whether there is a southern continent from a supposition that such a one existed In hopes of effecting this the following steps have been taken  In Ferdinand Magalhaens a Portuguese commanding five Spanish ships left Seville discovered the straits that bear his name and through them sailed into the Southern Ocean His ship was the only one out of the five that returned to Spain by the Cape of Good Hope  In September Sir Francis Drake an Englishman sailed from Plymouth with five ships and returned thither with one only in November  In July Sir Thomas Cavendish an Englishman left Plymouth with three ships and returned in September These last two voyages were productive of no discoveries  In July Oliver Van Noort a Dutchman sailed from Rotterdam with four ships sailed along the western coasts of America from whence by the Ladrones the Moluccas and the Cape of Good Hope he returned in August with one ship without making any discoveries  In August George Spilberg a Dutchman sailed from Zealand with six ships and returned by the Ladrones and Moluccas with two ships only in July without any discovery  In June James Le Maire and William Cornelius Schouten sailed from the Texel with two ships doubled Cape Horn discovered several islands in the South  Seas and returned in two years and ten days Le Maire died in the voyage  In James L'Hermite a Dutchman with eleven ships sailed into the Southern Ocean by Cape Horn and made no discoveries he died on the passage and hardly any of the ships but his own returned by Batavia in July  In one Cowley an Englishman sailed from Virginia doubled Cape Horn and returned to England by the Cape of Good Hope in October without making any discoveries  In William Dampier an Englishman sailed round the world and returned in  Edward Cooke an Englishman made the voyage in and  In August Woodes Rogers an Englishman left Bristol doubled Cape Horn attacked the Spanish coast up to California and arrived in the Downs by the Cape of Good Hope in October  Ten years after Roggewein a Dutchman left the Texel with three ships sailed round Cape Horn discovered several islands in the South Seas and returned July  In Admiral Anson made a voyage also round the world  In June Commodore Byron sailed from the Downs and doubling Cape Horn returned by the Cape of Good Hope in May after having made some discoveries  In July Captain Wallis sailed from England with two ships doubled Cape Horn and returned by the Cape of Good Hope in May with tolerable success  M De Bouganville a Frenchman sailed from Brest in doubled Cape Horn and returned by the Cape of Good Hope to St Maloes in with some discoveries  In August Captain Cooke made the same voyage with further discoveries and returned by Batavia in July  In June Captain Cook made the voyage a second time with still greater success and returned in July And  In July Captain Cook sailed from Plymouth a third time upon the same errand  The Southern Ocean has also been explored by different people who did not make a regular voyage round the globe viz by one Paulmier de Gonneville a Frenchman in and by Alfonzo de Salazar a Spaniard in by Alvaro de Saavedra in by Hurtado and Hernando in by Gaëtan in by Mendoca and Mendana in by Mendana in by De Quiros a Spaniard in by Tasman a Dutchman in and others who all made some discoveries but who have all failed in what they wished to finda Southern Continent so that none now is supposed to exist for Captain Cook in his last voyage sailed into as high southern latitude as ° and met with nothing but islands of ice that interrupted his passage and obliged him to steer  northward again But it still remains for future navigators to continue discoveries in the vast Pacific Ocean for none of the voyagers already mentioned sailed further north than ° S latitude so that almost across the whole ocean from the continent of America to New Britain the space between ° S to near ° N latitude remains still to be explored The Russians indeed have discovered some land in this part of the world in high northern latitude to the east of Chinese Tartary called Kamschatka or Camchatca of which some account is given at the end of this work but whether or not there is any land between that and ° S of the line is yet to be determined  There are many islands even in the Southern Seas that are not noticed in this work but they are such as were merely discovered in passage or barely touched at of course no account has been or could be given of them but their situation will be seen in the chart  In order to reduce this work into one volume that it might be within the reach of every one's pocket the author has studied to avoid all sorts of digression if therefore it is barren of reflections and observations he begs it may be considered that his plan was conciseness and to preserve this he has been under some necessity of foregoing any great attention to the beauty of the language The pages swell with narrative and narrative only Facts are what the reader will look for and in these he will be abundantly gratified As to reflections and observations upon what he is made acquainted with his own reason will suggest them  A DESCRIPTIVE ACCOUNT OF THE PRINCIPAL ISLANDS IN THE SOUTH SEAS  THE southern hemisphere having never till now been explored and affording us as it were a new world it cannot but be highly agreeable to the public to have a descriptive account of it It is true we may pick out such an account from the journals of the several voyages that have been made into that part of the world but it lies so diffused amidst  a heap of matter useless to the general reader as to be tedious uninstructive and unentertaining Besides the accounts there given being blended with metereological observations on the weather temperature of climate and variation of the compass soundings and bearings necessary only to a navigator the pages are so exceedingly voluminous as to be swelled to many quarto volumes It has been the business therefore of the compiler of the present narrative to digest and range the matter there found so as to give some regular account of each island from its first discovery to the present time and to shew the state of the inhabitants c as it fell under the observations of those who have there touched And he has endeavoured to describe every thing so particularly as to render drawings of them unnecessary  It being immaterial which island is first treated of we will begin with that which is most known the island of OTaheitee as it is called by the natives or King George the Third's Island as it was afterwards named by Captain Wallis  OTAHEITEE OR GEORGE THE THIRD's ISLAND  THIS island was probably first discovered by Pedro Fernandez de Quiros a Spaniard who sailed from Lima in Peru on Dec and made this land on the th of February following he called it La Sagittaria He continued here but two days leaving it the th of the same month It was next met with by Captain Wallis on the th of June who called it George the Third's Island and continued there about a month On the d of April M de Bouganville who made this voyage by order of the King of France arrived at the eastern part of this island and left it on the th Captain Cook was the next person that visited it coming to anchor here April He went round the whole island in a boat and continued here three months He made a second trip to this place and reached it August the th  and left it September the st following returned April left it again May the th following and is now upon his passage to the same place a fourth time It lies in ° ′ south latitude and ° west longitude and its S E bearing at about two leagues distance resembles a high pyramidical rock It consists as it were of two circular peninsulas one near as large again as the other joined by a small neck of land and one of these peninsulas is called by the natives  Opoureonu  or  OTaheitee nue  that is Great OTaheitee and is about nineteen miles across the other  Tiarrabo  or  OTaheitee ete  that is Lesser OTaheitee and is about eight miles across the neck of land that joins them is about two miles over and the whole island in length is about thirty miles and in circuit about one hundred and twenty  Face of the Country  THE island in general is surrounded by a reef of coral rocks which forms many excellent bays and harbours with plenty of room and depth of water sufficient for the largest ships The face of the land except the sea coasts is far from level it rises in hills quite to the middle of the island and there forms  mountains visible at twenty leagues distance so high that the island of Huaheine to the west may be seen in a clear day though at the distance of forty leagues the only low land is between the sea and the bottom of the hills which is of various breadths in different parts but no where more than about a mile and a half so that each of the peninsula's may be compared to a high crowned hat as it lies with its brim flat upon a table The soil except at the very summit of the hills is rich and productive being watered with a number of rivulets and cloathed with variety of fruittrees of fine thick foliage and lofty growth with shrubberries every where of odoriferous flowers The trees stand so thick that the country seems one continued wood and in some places even the tops of the hills though in general bare being burnt up with the sun are not wholly fruitless They are rocky but woody on the sides and covered with fern on the tops and the vallies covered with herbage From the black rocks of Bisaltes and the appearance every where of burnt clay and stone there is very good reason to suppose that the island has undergone a variety of changes by subterraneous firesbut at present it wears the most beautiful appearance and seems to be a universal garden  The flat lands bordering on the sea and some few of the vallies are the only parts where the inhabitants dwell The houses are built without order scattered up and down about fifty yards from each other in the shade of fruittrees and each house has a little plantation of plantaintrees from which they make their cloth The communications from place to place are by public paths judiciously formed and carefully kept The number of inhabitants cannot be ascertained with any degree of certainty but from what could be collected from the natives and the number of their war canoes the whole island cannot contain less than two hundred thousand inhabitants the strongest proof of its fertility and the richness of the spot  Productions  THE chief productions of this island are the breadfruit Bananas or plantains of thirteen different sorts cocoanuts yams the curassol or custardapple a tree that produces fruit something like the pineapple plenty of sugarcanes a species of wild indigo a very fine red and yellow substance for dying ginger and turmeric and many more which serve for food and other purposes but they have no European fruit vegetables  or grain of any kind The breadtree grows to near forty feet in height and its leaves are large and palmated of a deep green colour on the upper side and paler on the under and bears male and female flowers which shoot out single at the bottom of each leaf the male flower drops off and the female produces the fruit which when full grown is as big as a man's head weighs three or four pounds and is on the outside much like a rough melon It bears fruit a great part of the year some fit to pluck at different seasons It is generally gathered before it is ripe and the following is the method of preparing it for use Having scraped off the rind they cut it into quarters lay it between leaves and bake it for two or three hours it then appears inviting like a wellbaked loaf and tastes as if made of flower It will not keep many days but they have a method of preserving it for several months They build canoes of the wood of this tree and make a kind of cloth of the bark  The cocoanut when half ripe yields rather more then a pint of delicious liquor the milk and the kernel is good to eat of the rind they make a variety of things as by soaking and beating it it will become a kind of thread and of the leaves they make bonnets and baskets  M De Bouganville when he was there in persuaded one of the chiefs to enclose a piece of ground for a garden had it dug sowed it with wheat barley oats rice maize onions and potherbs of all kinds and gave him to understand of what great use they would be to the inhabitants if they were properly attended to they did not thrive for Captain Cook in neither saw nor heard of any of their product In May Captain Cook sowed some melon seed and the seed of other plants but they did not come up this might indeed have been the fate of the seeds which M de Bouganville sowed Indeed no European seeds seem to succeed here but those of pumkins which the natives dislike M De Bouganville also left a cock and hen turkey and some ducks and drakes The turkeys it is supposed died as there were none in but it is presumed the ducks bred and encreased there being plenty of them at present in the island Captain Cook in August left a couple of goats male and female and on his return the April following he found that the she goat had two kids and was then with kid again that they looked fleck and well that their hair was as soft and fine as silk and that there was  great prospect of the island's being stocked with them They also put near twenty cats on shore  Animals  OF domestic animals they have only little hogs of the Chinese breed small dogs and fowls like ours The dogs are very different from those we are acquainted with being a heavy sluggish animal of little more sensibility then sheep Of wild animals they have only ducks turtledoves of a beautiful green large pigeons of a deep blue colour cuckoos kingfishers herons c and paroquets beautifully red and green They have also some few turtles As to quadrupeds they have no other than rats which abound here nor have they any frogs toads serpents or other venemous animals not even a troublesome insect the plague of other tropical countries except a few ants and of these but few  Climate  THE climate is a healthy one and as to its heat Reaumur's thermometer continued between ° and ° in April and Farenheit's about ° and ° in August  Persons  THE inhabitants of the island are a stout wellmade people tall strong stately and fine shaped the men are fit models to paint a Hercules or a Mars from and are generally from five feet seven to six feet high and some even taller the women are remarkably handsome and beautifully made those of distinction rather taller than the English those of an inferior class rather below us in height This may possibly proceed from their early commerce with men Their natural complexion is a clear  brunette  their features do not differ from those of the Europeans except that their noses are rather flat being purposely flattened in their infancy their skin is delicately soft and smooth their eyes are black sparkling and full of expression and sometimes melting with softness though they have no crimson in their cheeks they are delicately clear their teeth are beautifully white and regular which continue so to old age and their breath without the least degree of taint and it is apprehended that were they less exposed to the sun and air they would be as white as ourselves Nay the skins of some few were seen of a dead white  like the nose of a white horse These had white hair eyebrows and eyelashes red and weak eyes skins scurfy and covered with a sort of down and were shortsighted but it was supposed they became so by disease  Their hair in general is black which they cut short round their ears but some few have brown hair and others red and flaxen though in children it is mostly flaxen whereas the original natives of Asia Africa and America have universally black hair they oil it with cocoanut oil in which they infuse a root that gives it the smell of roses and though they have no combs they dress it neatly The men wear their beards in many shapes plucking out great part of them but all in general have whiskers which they keep clean and neat and permit to grow so as to flow about the shoulders or else they tie it in a bunch upon the crown of their heads Both men and women take great pains to take out by the roots every hair that grows in the armpits and seem astonished that we are not delicate enough to do the same For want of combs they are too apt to be lousy which the children and common people pick out and eat the only instance in which they are not cleanly but those who could procure combs from any  of Captain Cook's people shewed their abhorrence of this filthiness by combing their heads till they had totally extirpated these disagreeable attendants indeed cleanliness is their chief characteristic Both men and women regularly bathe themselves in running water thrice a day as soon as they rise at noon and before they go to rest They wash their mouths at every meal and not only their mouths but their hands and this five or six times in the course of the meal and they keep their clothes without either spot or stain  Dress  THE people in general both men and women are frequently seen without any other covering than a sash or mantle round their waist but the principal people have an additional garment they wrap themselves gracefully in a piece of cloth containing many yards which hangs down as low as the knees Some of the women wear a piece of cloth with a hole in the middle through which they put their head so that it hangs down before and behind below the knees over this they throw a fine white cloth like a mantle which is wound several times over the body in elegant turns below the breast forming a kind  of tunic one turn sometimes falling gracefully across the shoulders and they know how to hang this mantle over them so as to give themselves an air of elegance and coquetry The inferior sort of people are known by a less quantity of cloth about them Girls under four years of age go quite naked and boys till they are six or seven The women of distinction in the evening uncover themselves to the waist and the men though they shall have about their middle as much cloth as would cover nine or ten persons will frequently leave the rest of the body quite naked this cloth is made like paper of macerated bark spread out and beaten together On their heads they occasionally wear a little bonnet made of matting or cocoanut leaves to defend their faces from the sun and the women sometimes wear small turbans and sometimes plait their hair in threads and wind it round their heads so thick as to produce a very good effect In this they occasionally stick flowers and feathers by way of ornament Both men and women wear earrings in one ear made of shell berries or small pearls They likewise let their finger nails grow except that of the middle finger on  the right hand and seem to pride themselves in it  When De Quiros first discovered this island in the men were quite naked and the women covered only from the waist downwards with a garment made of the palmtree he indeed saw one man who seemed to be a chief who had on his head a kind of coronet made of small black feathers so fine and soft that they resembled silk and behind hung down a bunch of red hair somewhat curled as low as the middle of his back by which we learn that a century and a half will make some alterations in the customs of the natives of the South Seas as well as in Europeans  It is a universal custom with these people both men and women to mark their loins and breech and back part of their thighs with black or blue lines in a variety of forms which they call  Tattowing  They stain themselves in this manner by puncturing or pricking the skin till it just bleeds with a sharp instrument something like a comb and then rubbing upon the part a grease made of soot and oil which continues through life such as are marked with deep blue punctures have the parts rubbed with  the juice of a plant that gives that colour They do not mark their children till they are about thirteen years old and though it is a painful operation and several days before the part is healed they bear it Stoically and with great resolution considering it as the highest ornament They are very lavish of this decoration especially on the breech and take pride in shewing it when they grow up either as marks of distinction or proofs of their fortitude in undergoing the operation  Food  THEIR diet is chiefly vegetables such as breadfruit cocoanuts plantains yams a particular kind of apple which the country affords and other fruits yet they occasionally eat pork poultry dogsflesh and fish Their dogs are fed wholly on vegetables and when killed young and well dressed are very little inferior to lamb The sea furnishes them with a variety of fish and their rivers yields them small mullet Small fish are eaten raw and for want of salt they dip their meat as they eat it into sea water They are very expert at catching fish which they do both by nets and lines their hooks being made of mother of pearl and they have a method of intoxicating  fish by the juice of one of their plants so as to catch them with the hands  It seems to be handed down among them by tradition that in early ages there was upon this island a race of cannibals or meneaters who were a very sturdy strong people but this race has been a long time extinct In the lesser peninsula there is scarce any breadfruit and the people seem wholly to live upon nuts not unlike a chesnut  Their manner of dressing their food is very singular having procured fire by making a groove in one stick and rubbing another in that groove in the same manner as carpenters whet their chissels till the small dust kindles they dig a hole in the ground about six inches deep and eight or nine feet in circuit this done they pave the bottom with pebbles and make a fire in it they then sweep off the ashes and lay their food upon it first covering it with plantain leaves and then heaping over it the hot embersHere it lies till it is sufficiently baked and when taken out it is tender juicy and full of gravy Their chief drink is water but they sometimes drink the juice of the cocoanut They have an intoxicating juice which they press out from the root of a plant  but it is seldom made use of but by the chiefs and by these not often for drunkenness to them is abominable their method of procuring this juice is disgusting and an exception to their natural cleanliness The root is chewed by several persons till it is soft and pulpy it is then spit out into a vessel and diluted with water and strained and in this state it is drank  When they sit down to meat it is on the ground in the manner of the Persians with a large quantity of leaves spread by way of a cloth Their provision is brought in baskets with two cocoanut shells one containing salt water the other fresh No one presumes to eat till he has washed his hands and mouth which he does often in the course of the meal They carve their meat with shells cutting from them and feed themselves with their fingers and will eat an immoderate quantity enough to fill five or six Europeans but what is remarkable they always eat alone not from want of sociableness but from a notion that it is right so to do If a family are to dine each will have his separate provision and they will fit themselves down at three or four yards distance from each other and turn their faces different  ways and not a word shall be heard through the whole meal  Habitations  THE huts of these people consist merely of a roof supported on three rows of pillars one at each side and one in the middle and thatched with the leaves of the palmtree their houses are formed like our hayricks with their roofs sloping both ways the eaves of the roof about three or four feet from the ground they have seldom any walls but are open at the sides and ends some few are enclosed with reeds having only a hole to enter in at which can be shut up with a board but these are the habitations of the principal people Within they are very neatly bedded with a kind of straw or hay on which they lay mats to sleep on resting their head on a block or fourlegged stool by way of pillow When dark they burn a kind of candle made of the kernels of an oily nut many of which they stick upon a small piece of stick like a skewer one over another when the first is burnt down the one below it takes fire and so to the bottom They seldom sit up longer than an hour after it is dark and when  they have any strangers with them they burn a light the whole night probably as the whole family sleep together that nothing improper may pass Their huts are enclosed by a low reed fence and some of them are surrounded with little plantations They are principally used indeed for sleeping in for unless the weather is bad they take their meals upon the ground without or under the shelter of a neighbouring tree The mantle that clothes them in the day covers them at night and the whole family sleeps upon the same floor without the least partition The master of the mansion and his wife in the middle next to them those who are married along side of those the single women and at a little distance from these the single men The servants sleep without unless it rains in this case they just creep beneath the roof  It should seem strange that a whole family should thus sleep together in common but when it is considered that the people of this island have not the least idea of indelicacy but gratify every passion publicly without any sense of impropriety the wonder will cease  Amusements  AFTER meals and during the heat of the day elderly persons of the better sort lie down to sleep indeed eating and sleeping is their general way of passing time for they have little to do but to procure themselves food and are a very indolent people so indolent as sometimes not to feed themselves If they plant a few trees in the course of their lives it is all that is expected from them They are not however without the more sprightly amusements such as music dancing wrestling swimming and diving which they do wonderfully both men women and children of six years old throwing a lance and shooting with a bow In throwing the lance their ambition is to hit a mark at about twenty yards distance and in using the bow he is the best archer that conveys the arrow farthest and as their arrows are not feathered they will often send them two hundred and eighty yards When they draw the bow they kneel and drop it as soon as the arrow is delivered  Their musical instruments are flutes only and drums the flutes are made of the bamboocane about twelve inches long with two holes only which they stop with the first finger of the  left hand and the middle one of the right Thus they have only four notes and of these they seem to have but one tune and what is more remarkable they sound this instrument in the manner of our German flute by blowing through their nostrils  The drum is cylindrical and formed of a hollow block of wood solid at one end and covered with the skin of a shark at the other These they beat with their hands and can tune them they have a contrivance also to tune the flute which they do by the ear with great exactness  To the sound of these instruments they sometimes sing and sometimes dance Their songs are in couplets and frequently extemporaneous and from their repeating them seem to be metre though without rhime At other times they dance and their way of dancing is not less singular than their music for they twist and writhe their bodies into many extravagant and wanton postures spread their legs and set their arms akimbo and at the same time distort their faces in a manner which no European can imitate Much of the cleverness of the dances seems to consist in the indelicacy of their attitudes which exceeds all description  Wrestling is also a public diversion and is exhibited before the chief and principal people of the island The following is a description of one When the spectators are seated round upon the ground and a ring thus formed the wrestlers are introduced consisting of eight or ten men stripped all to the sash that surrounds the waist These pace slowly round the area and by striking their left arm with the right hand give the general challenge particular challenges are afterwards given and each wrestler singles out his competitor but the contest instead of being kept up by skill seems merely a contest of strength each trying to throw the other by catching hold of the thigh the cloth the hair or any other part When the fall is given the victor receives a plaudit from the oldest persons present and the conquest is crowned by three huzzas Two only wrestle at a time and when the contest of these are over other two begin  They have also dramatic entertainments a kind of regular interlude performed by men and women divided into three or four acts These dramatic interludes are called by the islanders  Heava  and they consist of dancing and comedy and last near two hours the subject matter  of them is of a temporary nature such as invasions representations of women in labour and the birth of the child c c performed by men and the child also by a man and the dialogue is generally extemporaneous but from their singular contortions and oddity of their actions they are sometimes very laughable Sometimes the musicians will travel from one part of the island to the other and entertain the inhabitants at their several houses for which they are generally rewarded with such things as they may want and which the giver has to spare  Manufactures  THE principal manufacture of this island is cloth of which they have three sorts made of the bark of three different trees one better than the other though manufactured in the same way by soaking it in water and afterwards beating it out and it spreads very fast under the beater This done it is bleached and often dyed red or yellow with the juices of particular plants The cloth thus made is thin cool and soft but like paper is easily torn they have a way however of mending it by pasting pieces over the  fracture They also make matts by way of summer covering  They are likewise very ready in making baskets and wickerwork which they do very expeditiously They will make baskets of the cocoanut leaves in a few minutes and also bonnets to shade their faces from the sun not such bonnets as cover the head but merely a shade over the eyes which they tie round the head  Of the bark of another tree they make ropes and lines from the size of a packthread to that of an inch in diameter Of these they form their fishingnets and tackle and of the fibres of the cocoanut they make thread The fishhooks as I said before are made of mother of pearl and they make a kind of harpoon of cane pointing them with hard wood for they have no metal of any sort  Tools  THEIR tools in general are made with shells and stone and with these they will erect houses build canoes and after their manner carve images They make an adze with stone a chisel of human bone a rasp of coral and coral sand serves them as a file or polisher  Boats  THEIR canoes are of two kinds one for short trips called  Ivahah  and the other for longer voyages called a  Pahie  The first are of various sizes and used for various purposes fighting fishing and travelling their sides are perpendicular and their bottoms flat and they are of different breadths but not proportionable to their length which is from seventytwo feet to ten Those of ten feet long are about twelve inches wide and those of seventytwo feet in length are about twentythree inches in width  The fighting canoe is the longest the head and stern are raised in a semicircular form with a carved image on the top seventeen or eighteen feet above the sides of the boat which are seldom more than about thirty inches in height Two of these canoes are always fastened together at the distance of three feet by strong poles lashed to the sides Upon these in the forepart is erected a stage about eleven or twelve feet long like the quarter deck of a ship and rather wider than the canoes supported by pillars about six feet high On these stages stand the warriors and from hence they throw their lances their bows and arrows being  used only for diversion They also make use of slings Below these stages which sometimes cover the whole canoe sit the rowers sixteen or seventeen in number who paddle on with oars resembling a baker's peel and the spare men who when any are wounded on the platform above exchange places with them The fishing canoe is from ten to forty feet in length and sometimes carries a sail and the travelling canoes are always used in pairs and have generally a small house six or seven feet square built on a stage in the forepart of them and sometimes only an awning for in fine weather they go a pleasuring in these boats a number together and make a good appearance At these times the vessels are decorated with streamers and the people on board are dressed those who row and steer are dressed in white those who sit upon the awning and under it in white and red and two men mounted on the prow of each canoe in red only  The  Pahie  or canoe for longer voyages is bow sided and made with a keel at bottom they are from thirty to sixty feet in length but very narrow scarce two feet wide These are sometimes used double and are furnished with stages for fighting or other purposes  Some of these have one mast and some two and have sails of matting pointed at top square at bottom and curved at the side resembling what is called a shoulder of mutton sail These vessels have been out at sea for eighteen or twenty days together and might be longer if they could stow sufficient provisions When not in use they are drawn upon land and are carefully kept under a covering of thatch open only at the ends  When De Quiros touched here in the sails appeared to be  latine  made of palms and the seams joined with thongs composed of the same wood  When out at sea the Indians steer by the sun in the day time and the stars in the night every one of which they know by name and when and where they will appear They also can with some degree of certainty foretell the weather and from which quarter the wind will blow the ensuing day They tell you that the milky way is always curved but not in the same direction and that the wind will blow the next day from that quarter opposite the concave part of it  Division of Time c  THEY divide the year by the moon which they call  Malama  and measure the day by the sun They count by their fingers and measure distances by the time they pass them  Language  THEIR language is soft and harmonious and abounds with vowels like the Spanish and Italian which they can readily pronounce but they find a difficulty in pronouncing English The following list of words will give some idea of it  Aree  a chief  To aree  a secondary chief  Taowaa  a priest  Midee  a child  Tane  a husband  Huaheine  a wife  Eupea  a net  Mahanna  the sun  Mama  light  Timahah  heavy  Eho mai  come to me  Paraow mai  speak to me  Parahei  sit down  Ainao  take care  Mamoa  hold your tongue  Wa hoèe  what is it  Tai poe etee noòw  Pray give me a little bread  Diseases  WHERE food is simple and there is little debauchery there can be but few disorders the principal diseases of this island are cutaneous eruptions erisipelas ulcers and a kind of leprosy Those afflicted with the last seclude themselves from society and live in a small house alone Physicians they have none They run to the priest for cure who generally makes use only of a charm and incantation This ceremony is performed till the patient recovers or dies If he recovers they attribute it to the priest if he dies to the incurableness of the disorder In dangerous cases the nearest relations assemble in the sick man's house and continue nursing and watching him by turns till he dies or is out of danger Bleeding is used in this island but this is done by a priest in the  Sagittal  vein on the head the operation being performed with a sharp wooden instrument when a sufficient quantity of blood is taken away they tie the head round with a bandage which closes the orifice  Their commerce with Europeans have unfortunately entailed upon them the venereal disease It is supposed to have been communicated  by M De Bouganville's people for when Captain Wallis left it the disorder was not known there and when Captain Cook was there in it had made great ravage throughout the island but it is believed that they have found out a specific to cure it for it is not so general as it was  Disposal of the Dead  THERE are two kinds of deposit for the dead in this island one called a  Tupapow  which is little less than a shed under which the flesh is suffered to putrefy and the other called a  Morai  a kind of enclosure with pyramidical erections of stone where the bones are afterwards interred and the chief ambition of these people seems to be in the magnificence of their  Morai  As soon as any one dies the house of the deceased is crowded with relations Such as are nearest of kin and are truly affected by the loss are silent the rest are clamorous at one moment with lamentations and the next with laughing and vociferous talking for true grief always ties the tongue Thus is the remainder of the day and succeeding night spent and in the morning the body is wrapt in a cloth and  conveyed on a bier to the sea side attended by a priest there it is set down upon the beach close to the water and the priest prays and throws the water with his hands towards the body but not to touch it This ceremony is continued long enough till a house is built and a small spot of ground near it railed in Within the rails posts are set up to support the bier under a shed or covering erected for the purpose where the body is left covered with the cloth to putrefy  The body being thus deposited the women assemble and are conducted to the door of the house just mentioned by the nearest relation who wounds herself in the crown of her head by pricking it with the tooth of a shark till it bleeds plentifully this blood is taken upon a cloth and thrown under the bier every woman present follows her example and the ceremony continues two or three days The tears likewise that are shed at these funeral rites are wiped upon pieces of cloth and appropriated to the same use and some of the young folks cut off their hair and offer it as oblations on a presumption that the soul of the deceased is hovering round the body and observant of the love and fidelity of the mourners  When the women have performed their part the men begin Every relation in turn beginning with him who is the nearest of kin assumes the office of chief mourner he dresses himself in a fantastic dress such a one as in England would convey the idea which nurses affix to a ghost or goblin Captain Cook has presented one to the British Museum and Dr Forster another to the University of Oxford it consists of drapery shells and feathers and covers the whole body even the face At the death of a man the women wear this dress and at the death of a woman the men The chief mourner at the head of the rest who are naked to the waist and their bodies smeared with charcoal and water as low as the shoulders marches in procession to a great distance round the corpse and as he carries in his hand a long stick the end of which is set with shark's teeth and affects a kind of phrenzy occasioned by grief the people fly before him lest he should strike and wound them with it which he certainly would were they within his reach  These processions are not dropped till near the expiration of five months when the remains of the dead body are taken down and the bones scraped washed and buried within or without  a  Morai  or place of worship according to the distinction of the deceased  Even after this the priest continues for some time to pray for the departed and is well rewarded by the surviving relations who as their grief for the person deceased is supposed to wear out still visit the grave more or less and make occasional offerings upon the altars such as food and bunches of feathers  They go into mourning likewise and call it  Ceva  Their mourning consists of a veil over the face and a certain headdress of feathers When mourners go abroad they are preceded by slaves who beat castenets before them dolefully giving notice of their approach to every one who clears the way for them but as most good customs are abused this is no less so for clearing the way and wearing a veil gives the married women an opportunity to intrigue who frequently profit by the occasion The whole nation mourns on the death of a sovereign and mourning for a father is continued a length of time Women mourn for their husbands but this compliment is not returned them  Religion  LITTLE can be said of their religion with any certainty as none of the Europeans who have been there were sufficiently acquainted with their language indeed like the Chinese they have a different language to express their religious mysteries by from what is spoken in general The only thing rightly understood is that when the moon in their eyes wears a peculiar appearance they say it is in a state of war and at this time they have human sacrifices The person to be offered up as the victim is generally a bad man one who by his evil actions becomes obnoxious to society but as the person thus to suffer is fixed upon by the chief priest it often happens that individuals fall a sacrifice to the resentment of this man who no doubt has oratory sufficient to represent him as a villain When the people assemble upon any solemn occasion the priest enters the  Morai  alone and after staying there a considerable time he comes out and tells the multitude that he has seen and conversed with the supreme Being that he expects a human sacrifice that such a one present is the man and the poor wretch is  immediately beaten to death At other times they sacrifice hogs dogs and fowls  It appears that these people conceive that every thing in nature does and did proceed from procreation That the supreme Deity by conjunction with a rock brought forth the year that the year by a connection with the Father of all gave birth to the months and these by a further procreation among themselves the days The stars plants c they suppose to have obtained their existence somewhat in the same way Their ridiculous and futile imagination leads them to believe that there are certain inferior divinities whom they call  Eatuas  two of whom first inhabited the earth and were the progenitors of the first man brought forth in the shape of a ball but moulded into the present form by his mother that instinct led this first man to beget children upon his mother which children were females only so that it was many generations before he could get a son which at last he did out of one of his sisters and thus peopled the earth  Their inferior divinities of which they have a great number are supposed to be male and female The men pay their adoration to the males and the women to the females and there  are  Morais  or places of worship appropriated to both where priests officiate but these priests are men Their deities are rather such as we understand by genii of which they have good and bad and they suppose that a good or evil genius presides over each important action of their lives deciding its determinations whether it be successful or not In cases of sickness they seem to rely wholly upon these genii and neglect any application for cure but to the prayers of the priests and thus shew themselves strong predestinarians  They so far believe the immortality of the soul as to suppose that there are two separate states of existence hereafter which they conceive not to be places of rewards and punishments but merely receptacles for the different classes of men they have no conception that their actions here below can influence their future state and therefore as their view of immortality tends not to regulate their earthly conduct their religion must be disinterested and their adoration rise from an humble sense of their own insignificance when compared to the perfection of their divinities  The priesthood here is hereditary priests are generally chosen from some family of distinction  and have the highest authority inferior only to the chief They have a superior knowledge in religious mysteries but that knowledge consists in naming and classing their deities and preserving traditions They know a little more of astronomy and navigation indeed and to them only is appropriated the office of  tattowing  or puncturing the skin and circumcision which with them is a slitting only of the  prepuce  and adopted merely from motives of cleanliness  Marriage is celebrated with some few ceremonies but seems to be nothing more than the mutual contract of man and woman which is continued or dissolved as the parties shall agree the priest having nothing to do with them  The  Morai  is not only a place of burial but also as I said before a place of worship and to this place the Indian comes with the greatest humility and reverence with slow steps and a dejected eye inspired with a sense of his own inferiority and the exalted excellence of the Divinity he is going to adore and in this act disgraces the generality of Christians Nay they never pass a  Morai  but they uncover their shoulders as a mark of awful respect The floor of this place within is paved without an  altar or two resembling tables about seven feet high are raised pretty near the  Morai  and both within the walls and without are a number of small wooden statues uncouthly carved upon the top of a piece of wood which they stick into the ground They do not worship these images for they are by no means idolaters This and the neighbouring islands hold particular birds indeed in veneration some a heron others a kingfisher something in the same manner as we do the robin or the swallow but they pay not the least adoration to them  When a worshipper enters the  Morai  or approaches the altar to make his offering he strips himself naked to the waist and all his looks and actions declare an awful reverence for the place  Government  THOUGH the natives of OTaheitee live under no regular form of government yet a kind of feudal system subsists among them Each of the peninsulas has an  Earee Rahie  or sovereign and each district of which there are fortythree in the two peninsulas has an  Earee  or chief and these divide the lands within their territories among their vassals The island formerly  was under the command of one sovereign the kings of Lesser OTaheitee being sprung from those of the Greater the two sovereigns at present are nearly related and that of the former seems as it were a tributary to the latter Each chief keeps a kind of court and has a number of officers and it is observable that he seldom gives his decision in any case without the advice of council If an offence was given at any time to the people by the Europeans that visited them the matter was to be adjusted with the chief before a reconciliation could be brought about The male child of a chief as well as of the sovereign as soon as born succeeds to the title of its father and dispossesses the parent of all his honours except that of the management of the estate c and of conducting and carrying on the business till the boy is of age  In case of an attack every district furnishes its proportion of fighting men and the sovereign commands the whole Their weapons are slings pikes and clubs when they fight it is with great obstinacy and they give no quarter but often kill their prisoners men women and children and carry off their jawbones as trophies in like manner as the Indians of North America  do the scalps If a dispute at any time arises between two chiefs it is settled among themselves Captain Cook was once present at a naval review and found it consisted of upwards of three hundred large canoes completely equipped and manned with near eight thousand men the chiefs and all those on the fighting platforms were habited in their war accoutrements which consisted of a great quantity of cloth turbans breastplates and unwieldy helmets The canoes were dressed with flags and streamers This fleet was designed to attack a neighbouring island that had thrown off its independency on OTaheitee Some of the troops at Captain Cook's request went through their exercise on shore Two parties first began with clubs the blows of the clubs were aimed at the legs and head those at the legs were evaded by jumping and those at the head by stooping or leaping aside when they proceeded to use their spears or darts they parried the push or dart by fixing the point of a spear in the ground before them and directing the other end of it as they foresaw the aim was made  There is no such thing as money among them the fruit of the trees are in common to all the commerce of the seas is no way restrained  and there seems to be few things that can be taken by violence or fraud In a state therefore where there is but little opposition of interest every passion being so readily gratified there cannot be many crimes of course a regular distribution of justice will be unnecessary It is true there are thefts here but as none among these people can be much injured or benefited by such thefts they are not restrained by any public law but the punishment of the criminal rests with the injured person They do not seem disposed to rob one another but they made no scruple of stealing from the Europeans whenever they had an opportunity even the chiefs would stoop to purloin a nail or a piece of glass bottle but when it is considered that an Indian among iron and glass is in the same state of temptation with the poorest European among unlocked boxes of jewels and gold it is not to be wondered at To rate the virtue of these people properly we must take a view of their moral system which is ever to conform to what they think right If they have any notions of right and wrong they must proceed from the mere dictates of nature for lessons they have none on this head and as theft among themselves is attended but  with little disadvantage to the injured person they think very little of it In this light they considered nails and other things to Captain Cook and his people and thought no wrong in making free with what they presumed the persons they took them from could not miss Adultery is sometimes heard of in this island and if the parties are caught in the act the man perhaps is instantly slain by the injured husband if he is the strongest of the two and the wife escapes with a beating It seldom happens that the chiefs interfere Murder indeed is sometimes punished with death and the criminal in this case is hanged  The distinction of rank preserved in this island does not materially affect the happiness of the people In a country where scarce a second garment is necessary where every one can gather fruit from the first tree he meets or is at liberty to take some in any house which he enters where the necessaries of life can be easily obtained there can be but little envy but little repining The upper class of people it is true enjoy some dainties which the lower class probably cannot get at this may hurt an individual but cannot affect a nation at large The distinction between the greatest and the  lowest man in OTaheitee is not more than between a manufacturer in England and his workman A chief has the command of life and death over his servants and slaves but he very seldom exercises it and notwithstanding this is more beloved than feared a proof of the mildness of their government He alone has power to plant the Babylonian willow before his house for by bending down the branches of this tree and planting them in the ground they will shoot afresh thus the shade may be extended to any distance and in any direction Under these shady arches the chiefs regale whose servants are known by wearing sashes high up under the arms which others wear only round their middle When a chief approaches or passes it is customary for all to uncover their shoulders as a compliment but this is all the meanest man in the island addresses his sovereign as freely as he would an equal and can see him whenever he pleases for not depraved by the empty notions of European greatness the king will often amuse himself with his subjects and at times will paddle in his own canoe  Character and Customs  AFTER what has been said of these people it cannot be supposed that chastity here is in much repute Their natural simplicity is so great that the very conjugal rites are performed in public a whole family or houshold resting at night in one room In more northern climates girls and unmarried women are supposed to be ignorant of the business of the marriagebed but here it seems to be the very reverse Among their dances where eight or ten young single women can be got together they have one which consists of such wanton and lascivious gesticulations accompanied by obscene discourse that one is led to think that such gestures and expressions must be taught them at the earliest age but they are no sooner married than they leave off this foolish practice Some of the principal women of the island introduced themselves to Captain Cook and his officers by several times taking up all their garments round them quite to the waist and as where there is no idea of indelicacy with respect to actions there can be none in words their language is grossly obscene and as freely spoken by the women as the men  The women in general are very lively in their conversation and very chatty and they have vivacity and understanding often to be witty and to play upon words  To give the reader a still better idea of their want of decency and to convince him that it does not arise from depravity of sentiment but from an innate simplicity authorized by custom I need only mention that when Captain Cook was there in the year and then on a visit to the queen of the island she entertained him with an exhibition of a very singular kind and among the spectators were many women of distinction A young man of uncommon stature was directed by her to perform the rites of Venus with a little girl about twelve years old which was done without the least sense of impropriety on either side and though the girl seemed to want no instructions in the office her Majesty vouchsafed to assist at the ceremony  But though the unmarried are so little reserved they no sooner take a partner for life than they are as choice of their favours as before they are free of them and if we consider the simplicity both of their education and dress we cannot justly charge them with the crime of  unbounded licentiousness There are some women of the better sort and some few even of the lower class that are in this respect very reserved all I would infer is that freedoms of the kind I mentioned are not considered here as crimes of such a nature as to preclude them from society and as a further proof of it it need only be told that a very respectable chief offered his wife to Captain Cook in exchange for a few red feathers and she by the orders of her husband took some pains by a studied display of her charms though artfully concealed to captivate him But to shew that they are delicate in their notions notwithstanding this freedom of conduct and that it is not every man with whom they will assort take the following little anecdote When Captain Cook was there in he had on board his vessel a weak scorbutic man with one eye who soon after his arrival gaining a little strength and spirits upon a vegetable diet paid his addresses to a pleasing OTaheitean girl lighted a candle and conducted her from the deck to his birth below but she no sooner looked in his face and found that he had lost an eye than she refused to continue with him led him upon deck again introduced him to a oneeyed girl  at that time there and gave him to understand that she was a more suitable partner for him for that for her part she would not take up with a blind lover  But as in every country there are some more dissolute than others so is it in OTaheitee there is a society formed here of a great number of the principal people of the island of both sexes called an  Arreoy  where to indulge their passions and keep up their flame by a pleasing variety every woman is common to every man and where in order to stimulate desire frequent meetings are held among them at which time the men wrestle and the women dance and endeavour by the most wanton gestures to incite those amorous passions that probably could not be kept alive any other way and the passion once raised is immediately gratified This custom may possibly be consonant with their peculiar notions but the sequel is horrid Should any of these women prove pregant which does not often happen the poor infant is smothered as soon as born that it may be no interruption to those diabolical pleasures of the father and mother who if the child is preserved are immediately excluded the society and the members of this association instead of being  ashamed of the connection pride themselves in it and boast of it as a privilege  But as the natives of this island have the general character of being gentle generous tender and affectionate which cannot be reconciled with the murder of their own children there may be other reasons than unbounded licentiousness to countenance this society and as all the men who are members of it are warriors such an association may be political as it obviates the attachments of both wife and child Besides such a society might be instituted to prevent multiplying the chiefs of the island who perhaps once were pettytyrants especially as a child brought forth in wedlock is a chief as soon as born and the members of this association were generally chiefs and are now persons of the first distinction This society may thus have been instituted in sound policy and the respect it is held in in the island seems to favour the notion but as all institutions in course of time are liable to abuse it may be the case here for the members seem to meet merely to indulge a voluptuous disposition They feast on the choicest dainties and that to excess they make a free use of the intoxicating plant they are amused with music  and lascivious dancing and a train of sensual pleasures surrounds them But at the same time they are friendly and hospitable to each other in the highest degree and to soften the crime of murder on the part of the mother it is but justice to observe that they never give up their children but at the entreaties and persuasions of the rest and where entreaties will not prevail force is employed and the murder is committed in secret  Polygamy is not allowed among them except among the principal people of the island Love being the reigning passion a number of wives is the highest luxury The women pay a blind submission to their husbands and though an exception is now and then to be found to the general rule they would sooner die than be guilty of conjugal infidelity and so little is jealousy known among them that when a woman yields to the importunities of a stranger it is generally by the husband's persuasion  As the reader probably will wish to know the reception the first European vessel met with at this island I will relate what happened to Captain Wallis in June for till this time no European ship had touched there except that of De Quiros in and he continued there not  more than two days besides it being more than a century and a half ago the visit of Captain Wallis may be considered as the first which the natives of this island ever received from a civilized people  When Captain Wallis's ship brought up close under the land which the depth of water enabled him to do he was soon surrounded by some hundreds of canoes with several persons in each When they came within pistol shot they gazed and seemed to hold a council how to act at last they paddled round the vessel exhibiting signals of friendship and one of them made a speech Soon after this some few came on board but one of them being butted by a goat then on deck and on turnign round seeing the goat rise on his legs they all jumped over the sides of the vessel in the greatest fright but soon swam round her and returned on board again and the crew had enough to do to prevent their stealing sundry things that lay in their way one of them snatched off a goldlaced hat from an officer's head leaped overboard and swam off with it Upon the Captain's sending out a boat to sound the depth of water the Indians to prevent their coming on shore threw stones into her and wounded some  of the men which made an officer in the boat fire his musquet loaded with buckshot at the Indian who threw the first stone and wounded him on the shoulder This was an alarm sufficientit brought together three or four hundred canoes with upwards of two thousand men armed with slings and stones of two pounds weight who attacked the ship and hurt some of the crew but they were soon quieted and dispersed by firing a few great guns at them with the loss only of a few Indians they prepared for a second attack but found it in vain in short they became so afraid of a gun that was a musquet pointed at them thousands would fly before it like a flock of sheep Indeed so great was their dread that when a party of Indians once attempted to attack an officer then strolling about on shore by himself he put them all to flight by presenting his toothpick case at them which they conceived to be a little gun After this the ship's boats went peaceably to shore and upon signals of friendship made on both sides a trade was opened with the islanders which improved every day The things they valued most were nails and hatchets they having no such thing as iron among them and the rates of trafficking were a spike for a  small pig a smaller for a fowl a hatchet for a hog and a middlingsized nail for twenty cocoanuts or breadfruit Nay they trafficked with the ships crew for the personal favours of their daughters and sisters whom fathers and brothers brought down to the seaside on purpose a nail was generally the price of these favours but to shew that they were not insensible of the superiority of charms in one female more than another the size of the nail demanded rose always in proportion to the beauty of the lady but no nails were current at OTaheitee under the size of a fortypenny  When the ship had been there about three weeks the Captain was introduced to a woman of distinction among them She invited him to her house and taking hold of his hand made all her attendants of which there were a great number both male and female kiss itWhen any of the natives meet a friend whom they have not seen for some time they affect to cry for joy but no such ceremonial passed here they kissed the Captain's hand This lady's house was merely a roof thatched with palm leaves like other habitations in the island but covering a spot of ground three hundred and twentyseven feet long and fortytwo feet in  breadth it was raised upon three rows of pillars thirtynine on each side and fourteen in the middle The ridge of the house within was thirty feet high and the sides of it to the eaves of the thatch twelve feet high As Captain Wallis and his party entered she beckoned four girls by waving her hand downwards that being the method there and ordered them to take off the Captain's shoes and stockings and then directed the girls to rub and chafe their feet between their hands This is considered at OTaheitee and is in reality the greatest refreshment When the young women had continued this for about half an hour they dressed their legs again and by the order of their mistress brought some bales of cloth of their own manufacturing to clothe them in the fashion of the country but they declined it This done the Queen presented them with a sow big with pig and conducted them to the shore where the boats lay and what is remarkable at every little dirty place they passed she took the Captain up in her arms and lifted him over with as little difficulty as we would lift a child During this visit one of the gentlemen took off his wig to wipe his head having walked till he was warm which so astonished  the Indians that they could not have been more so had his limbs been screwed to his body and he had unscrewed them one after another  As a general character of these people let it suffice to say that they are hospitable unambitious and far from revengeful They probably are not so sincere in their professions of friendship as from appearances might be expected for they weep upon every little occasion and seem to have tears at will like children they cry for trifles and like children too their sorrows are soon forgotten but when we reflect that they have never been taught either to disguise or suppress their passions and are not accustomed to thought which alone only can recall the past and anticipate the future it is no wonder that their sorrows should be transient they are affected only with the occurrence of the passing minute and yet they are of a benevolent disposition Their life resembles in a great measure what poets call the  Golden Age  for they are happy in their simplicity and innocence and if the frequent visits of Europeans do not corrupt their manners may continue so to the end of time Though they have no trade they have plenty of amusements and employments manufacturing of  their dress is an agreeable employ to the women and building houses and canoes with making of tools and arms sufficient occupation for the men Most of their days are spent in a country where nature has been lavish of her gifts where the temperature of the air is warm but continually refreshed by wholesome breezes where the atmosphere is constantly clear and serene and where the climate and fruits of the land contribute to the strength the pleasure and elegance of the natives In short their tempers are unruffled by violent passions they live a life of ease equanimity and content and are situated in a delightful country free from care and happy in their ignorance resembling the paradise of Mahomet where the appetites are gratified without ever being cloyed  When M De Bouganville was at OTaheitee he met with a native of that island about thirty years of age very desirous of accompanying him to France and his countrymen seemed to approve the step He happened however to be a stupid fellow and in two years stay at Paris could never get to speak or even pronounce the language possibly from some impediment in his speech yet still he would go  out into the streets by himself and was well acquainted with the town He frequently made a purchase and seldom paid more for it than its value The principal exhibition that pleased him was the opera and particularly the dancing he constantly went there by himself paid for his admission and his favourite place was in the seats behind the boxes Among the great number desirous of seeing him he knew how to distinguish those who were most civil and his grateful heart never forgot them The Duchess of Choiseul appropriated a sum of money for the purpose of conveying a variety of tools to OTaheitee and the ministry sent him in March to the Isle of France that he might be thence conveyed home but he never lived to reach his native isle for having caught the smallpox it proved fatal to him M De Bouganville allotted one thousand five hundred pounds being a third part of his fortune towards equipping the ship for that purpose  THE SOCIETY ISLES  CONSISTING of six Huaheine Ulietea Otaha Bolabola Tubai and Maurua are situated between the latitude of ° ′ and ° ′ and between the longitude W from Greenwich ° ′ and ° Ulietea and Otaha lie within two miles of each other and are inclosed in one reef of coral rock which forms many excellent harbours  Bolabola lies N W and by W from Otaha and about four leagues distant surrounded by several little islands together about eight leagues in circuit and the chief of this island has lately conquered and now governs the isles of Ulietea and Otaha and also Maurua which lies fifteen leagues to the westward so that these conquered isles are governed by a Viceroy and many of the conquered natives have retired to Huaheine and OTaheitee There is  very little difference in any of these islands respecting the customs manners c c of the inhabitants I shall therefore speak only of Huaheine and Ulietea and that but little In landing at these several islands the ships crews met with no resistance but a friendly and peaceful welcome How these islands came under the dominion of the sovereign of Bolabola is thus related by a native  Some years since the Chiefs of OTaheitee and other neighbouring isles banished such as were guilty of thefts and other crimes not deserving death to that of Bolabola which till then was uninhabited In course of time the numbers increased so much that the produce of the island was not sufficient for their support Being men of desperate fortunes they built canoes turned pirates and made such of their neighbours as fell in their way their prisoners seizing their property One of the worst of these banished men became their chief and encreasing every year in power and property by such depredations he invaded Otaha and took it he afterwards conquered Ulietea and other islands and they from that time became a part of his dominions  HUAHEINE OR HUAHENE  IS situated in south latitude ° ′ and ° ′ west longitude It lies thirtyone leagues N W of OTaheitee and is about seven leagues round The face of it is hilly and uneven and it has on the west a safe and commodious harbour It was first discovered by Captain Cook on the th of July  Huaheine is divided by a deep inlet into two peninsulas joined by an istmus which is overflowed at high water Its hills are not so lofty as those at OTaheitee but like the hills of that island they seem to be the remains of a volcano the top of one has the appearance of a crater and a kind of lava is very conspicuous on one of its sides  The face of the country is similar to that of OTaheitee but in a less scale though it is considerably more picturesque the sides of the hills being here cultivated owing to a scarcity of level ground From the principal bay the islands of Ulietea Otaha and Bolabola may be seen the last appears like a conical hill forked at the top  The natives speak the same language wear the same habits and are the same as the OTaiheteans except that they are not so darkcoloured The women in general are as handsome and both women and men rather stouter larger made and less timid but if any thing they are more indolent and lazy  The productions likewise of this island are the same as those of the lastmentioned but are about a month forwarder in their growth They have here indeed mulberrytrees which are not to be met with at OTaheitee Of the cocoanuts the inhabitants make a food by scraping them and mixing them with yams and eating it so as to resemble a kind of oily hastypudding There are a great quantity of ducks curlews and snipes and here are some insects and scorpions and the same animals which are found at OTaheitee Notwithstanding the stupidity of the dogs they are in high favour with the women who are so ridiculously fond of them that they will suckle the puppies at their breasts The dogs in general of these islands are of various sizes from that of a lapdog to the size of a large spaniel The head is broad and pointed at the nose the eyes are small the ears upright  the hair lank and hard and the colour mostly brown and white and they seldom bark but often howl and seem to have an aversion to strangers Their method of killing them for food both here and at OTaheitee is by stifling them either by stopping their fundament with grass and holding their nose and mouth between their hands till they die or by laying them on their backs and pressing their throats with a stick till they are choaked  The amusements and customs of this island are also the same with those of the lastmentioned They have their  Heava  or dramatic entertainments and also their  Arreoy  or licentious society but parents do not here suffer their daughters to follow their own inclinations A reciprocal changing of names is here a friendly ceremony and when they accept a present as they do at OTaheitee they lift it always above their heads  Huaheine is governed also by chiefs related to those at OTaheitee and the religious notions of this place and indeed of all the neighbouring isles is much the same as that which has been there described excepting that each island as a separate theogony calling their deities by different names They believe every man to have  a distinct being within him who acts according to the impression of the senses This being they suppose to be immortal and after the death of the person they inhabit to take possession of and lodge in the wooden images that decorate their  Morai  or places of burial They conceive both sun and moon to be inhabited by its respective divinity and so far pay them adoration as they suppose them to have an influence on things below Their good or evil genii are addressed in proportion to the good or ill they do the good are supplicated by prayers and the evil are revered by hissings  In a word it would be unjust to their general character if I did not say that notwithstanding their errors and customs inconsistent with European nations they possess the most exalted sentiments sentiments that do honour to mankind and though various characters are found among all nations for one villain in these isles there are fifty to be found in a civilized country They are friendly and hospitable without seeming to know it and leave their virtues to be recorded by strangers who visit them  When Captain Fourneaux was at this island in he at the request of a young man at  that time there brought him away to shew him to the people of England as M de Bouganville did a native of OTaheitee to Paris This man's name is Omai a native of Ulietea he is of the middling class of people and had some property there but was plundered of it by the inhabitants of Bolabola He is far from being a specimen of the natives of these islands they being in general much fairer much handsomer and much better made He is a man however of quick parts honest principles and a good understanding He continued two years in England under the patronage of Lord Sandwich Dr Solander and Mr Banks While here he was introduced into the best company conducted to every splendid entertainment and frequently was led to court and taken uncommon notice of by his Majesty He fell in with that elegance and ease natural to the polite people of the age and adopted the manners and amusements of those with whom he associated As a proof of his understanding he soon became a proficient in the game of chess No one here attempted to improve his understanding or his moral character the only pains taken was to lead him into a round of fashionable enjoyments and feast  his eyes with daily wonders During his stay here he was inoculated for the smallpox and when Captain Cook sailed for OTaheitee again in July Omai voluntarily went with him though with manifest regret at leaving England He carried with him a great variety of dresses and other ornaments a portable handorgan a puppetshow a coat of mail a suit of armour and an electrical machine which he was taught to use Though at years of maturity his judgmentw as still in its infant state and like children he coveted every thing he saw he did not carry with him any instruments of real use in life but a variety of domestic animals male and female were put on board as a present from Captain Cook to the inhabitants of OTaheitee and the other South Sea islands  ORAIETEA OR ULIETEA  LIES S W and by W about seven or eight leagues from Huaheine It was first discovered by Captain Cook in July and is about three times as large as Huaheine has much broader plains and much higher hills the soil at the top of which is a kind of stone marle  on the sides may be seen a few slints and small pieces of spongy stone lava another confirmation that volcanos must formerly have existed here  It is governed by a viceroy deputed by the sovereign of Bolabola who conquered it and is neither so populous nor so rich in produce as OTaheitee or Huaheine  Their  Morais  here are different from those of OTaheitee They consist only of an area about twenty yards square enclosed with four walls about eight feet high made with coral stones At one side many planks are set up an end carved from top to bottom and in this island and at Huaheine they make use of a machine resembling the ark of old which they call the House of God and remove it from place to place by poles like those of a sedan chair It is frequently seen near a  Morai  Shagreen both here and at Huaheine is met with in plenty there is some at OTaheitee but it is scarce  The manner of the principal peoples receiving a visit of ceremony here is also differend from what has been mentioned elsewhere which is being seated within their habitations  at the end of a long mat and the party introduced by four or five old women weeping and as it were bitterly lamenting and cutting their heads with instruments made of the teeth of a shark till the blood runs plentifully down their faces and shoulders before the visitor enters these women embrace him and thus frequently besmear him with their blood This ceremony ended they go and wash themselves and immediately appear as chearful as any of the company  The dances and dramatic entertainments in this island also are very singular in one house where Dr Solander and Mr Banks paid a visit by order of the master a man with a large cylindrical piece of wickerwork upon his head about four feet long and eight inches in diameter faced with feathers placed perpendicularly and edged round with sharks teeth began to dance In dancing he often twisted his head in such a manner that the top of the headdress described a large circle and was frequently striking the bystanders which never failed to produce a laugh at the expence of the person so struck  Among the comic dances was one in which the performers who were all men were divided  into two parties distinguished from each other by the colour of their dress One was white and the other brown The brown party represented a master and his servants and the white a parcel of robbers the first had a basket of provisions given into their care by their master and the dance of the white consisted of several expedients to steal it After a length of time the brown party set their basket down on the ground in the midst of them and leaning upon it went to sleep the others taking advantage of this opportunity lifted them up and went off with it soon after this the sleepers awoke missed their basket but without regarding the loss proceeded to dancing The dramatic action of this dance would have stood the test of criticism and persons of taste must have admired the simplicity unity and chasteness of the whole  EASTER ISLE OR DAVIS LAND  IS situated in ° ′ ″ S latitude and ° ′ ″ W longitude from Greenwich it is of a triangular form about four leagues long on the S E side three leagues and a half on the N W side and about two leagues and a half on the N E side It has a hilly and stony surface and the hills are high enough to be seen at fifteen or sixteen leagues distance This is supposed to be the land seen by Captain Davis in but the discovery is attributed to Roggewein the Dutchman in April who called it  Easter Island  it being EasterDay when he first saw it It is called by the natives  Waihu  It was afterwards visited by some Spaniards in and by Captain Cook in March It lies about six hundred leagues W of the coast of Peru  Face of the Island c  BUT the honour of discovering this island is not worth contending for it affording neither anchorage fuel good water or any convenience for shipping The whole country is barren and ruinous without wood and strewed with volcanic cinders in many places it is stripped of its soil to the very rock which seems to contain an iron ore It is more than probable that this island was produced by a volcano and destroyed by its fire There are however several plantations of potatoes plantains and sugarcanes but every thing is obliged to be raised by the dint of labour Their plantations are prettily laid out by line and fenced in with stone They plant their bananas in holes one foot deep in order to collect the rain without which contrivance they would not grow in this parched country The grass which naturally springs among the stones in uncultivated spots is carefully pulled up and spread as a manure over the whole plantation or perhaps to preserve it from the scorching sun  Productions  THE chief produce of the isle is potatoes nuts plantains sugarcanes yams and some few gourds Their potatoes are sweet as carrots and of a goldyellow colour the Indians use them instead of bread The plantains are very delicious and the sugarcanes sweeter than those at OTaheitee indeed the juices of every vegetable seem concentrated by the dryness of the soil There is here a particular shrub called by the natives  Torromedo  not much unlike the common vetch but the pod in its size and shape resembles that of a tamarind The wood is reddish and pretty hard and heavy but very crooked small and short not exceeding six or seven feet in height The seeds have a disagreeable bitter taste and the natives seem to think them poisonous They have in this island also the OTaheitean clothplant but it does not thrive well in short the different species of plants do not exceed twenty  Animals  THE only animals seen here were cocks and hens of the European kind well tasted but small and rats which they use as food Land birds there are scarcely  any and sea birds but few and these are men of war tropic and eggbirds noddies tern c but what is still worse the coast seems not to abound with fish  Persons  THE number of inhabitants seems not to exceed six or seven hundred and above two thirds of these are men This disproportion can no otherways be accounted for but by the womens concealing themselves This might be the case or it might not for very few children were seen and the behaviour and conduct of those women who made their appearance gave it to be understood that they could well dispense with a plurality of husbands In colour features and language the natives here bear so great an affinity to those of the more Western Isles that they must have had the same origin but how the people should spread themselves throughout the whole South Sea which is not less than one quarter of the globe is truly astonishing The inhabitants of Easter Island are of a middle stature but slender with thin features their muscles are hard and rigid influenced as must be supposed by the heat and sterility of the country They are lively strong well made and swift of foot  Their looks are mild pleasing modest and submissive Their complexion in general is a chesnut brown but some few are darker and some are quite white and the bodies of the men are very hairy Their beards are black and strong and they wear them clipped short The noses both of men and women are not very broad but rather flat between the eyes their lips though not so thick as those of the negro are strong and their hair is black and curling Their eyes are dark brown and rather small and the whites of them not so clear as in other islands of the South Seas The women wear their hair long and sometimes tie it up on the crown of the head but the men never suffer theirs to grow more than three inches in length Both men and women are remarkable for the great length of their ears They pierce the flaps of them and stretch the holes by wearing a leaf in them rolled up tight like a scroll till they become two or three inches long and reach the shoulder They sometimes turn this slit over the upper part of the ear and it then looks as if the flap was cut off  From the Dutch relation of Roggewein's voyage we are taught to believe that the savages  of this island were in twice as tall and as thick as the largest European that the men measured in general twelve feet in height and the women from ten to eleven But this relation cannot be true as Captain Cook met with none exceeding six feet high  They  tattow  or puncture the skin here as they do at OTaheitee and mark themselves from head to foot face and all in various figures nearly alike but in different directions as fancy leads The women are not punctured so much as the men but they paint their whole faces with a reddish brown over which they lay the bright orange of the turmeric root or ornament them with streaks of white  Dress  THE scorching heat of the sun obliges them to cover their heads which they do with a round fillet decorated with feathers and a straw bonnet something like a Scotch one Others wear large bushy caps of brown gull feathers little less than the wig of an English judge  The womens cloathing consists of a piece or two of red and white quilted cloth about six feet by four or a mat One piece wrapped round the loins and another thrown over the  shoulders but the men go almost naked except a slip of cloth between the legs both ends of which are fastened to a belt round the waist Both sexes wear on the breast suspended by the neck a flat piece of bone shaped like a laurel leaf and occasionally necklaces and earrings made of shells by way of amulet or charm  Habitations  THE construction of their huts declares the poverty and wretchedness of the people They resemble a canoe lying upon the ground with the keel upwards are about fifty or sixty feet long and are built in the following manner The foundations are laid with stone by paving the ground in two curve lines converging at the extremities to each other the distance from line to line in the middle is about six feet and at the ends not more than a foot In every stone of this line or foundation is made a hole into which they fix a stake six feet high in the middle and diminishing proportionably to two feet at the ends these stakes are drawn together and fastened at the top and the whole is covered with matting of sugarcane leaves to the ground On one  side is left an opening eighteen or twenty inches high by way of entrance covered with a kind of porch so that to get in they are obliged to creep upon the hands and knees In these huts they only sleep and that on the bare ground Some have sheds made with piles of stone and some seem to live in caverns cut in the rocks but as no admittance could be obtained into these nothing can be said about them  Utensils  THEY do not appear to have any utensils except gourds Roggewein in talked of their having earthen pots but no such thing was seen in They dress their victuals in the OTaheitean fashion with hot stones in an oven or hole in the ground and roast their plantains under fires of straw or dried grass  Manufactures c  THEY make a kind of cloth here of the bark of the paper mulberry as they do at OTaheitee which they quilt with thread to strengthen it and paint yellow with turmeric When completed it is soft to the touch like silk and  they make baskets bonnets c of matting very neat  Their working tools are very mean and few made of stone bone or shells but yet they are very ingenious at carving and shew a taste for the arts They carve human figures about eighteen inches long with great neatness and proportion and polish them very highly  In several places on the coasts of this island are a number of gigantic stone statues some erected in groups in platforms of masonry and others single fixed only in the earth They resemble a human figure to the waist are thirty feet high more than eight feet across the shoulders and seemed to be formed each of one single stone The workmanship is rude and the eyes nose and mouth scarce marked on an illshaped head but the ears quite long in the present fashion of the country On the heads of these statues are placed huge round cylinders of stone five feet in height and five in diameter set upright They seem to have been erected over the graves of some chiefs in former days not being the workmanship of the present inhabitants but preserved now as monuments of antiquity How these stones were thus raised  one upon another is as little to be guessed at as the manner in which those at Stonehenge were erected The islanders do not pay any adoration to them but hold them in a kind of veneration and will not suffer any one to tread upon the platforms They probably may have some tradition concerning them but as the Europeans who visited the island did not continue long enough to learn the language nothing could be collected with any certainty except only that they were the burial places of some former chiefs  They call the statues by the following names  KoTomoaï KoTomoèeree KoHòooo Morahèena Oomarèeva Weenâboo Weenapè  Arms  THE offensive weapons of the people of Easter Isle are short wooden clubs spears made of crooked sticks about six feet long pointed with pieces of flint and a kind of short battleaxe  Canoes  THEIR canoes are wretched about eighteen or twenty feet long and very narrow the head and stern are raised a little and carved and fitted with outriggers  they will not carry above four persons and are not to be navigated to any distance They are patched up with pieces of wood two or three feet long and four or five inches wide and are worked with paddles made up also with several pieces of wood In one of these canoes seen by Captain Cook was a board six or eight feet long fourteen inches broad at one end and eight at the other This is mentioned as at that time there did not appear to be a tree upon the island that would have yielded a board of half that size  Religion and Government  VERY little can be said of the religion of these savages except that they are not idolators and as little can be said of their government whether or not they have one or more chiefs among them When Roggewein was there they appeared and spoke without distinction the government was obviously patriarchial the most aged had plumes of feathers on their heads and a staff in their hands and it was observable that in each house or family the oldest persons governed and gave the orders When Captain Cook was there there seemed to be but little subordination  among them The plantations on the island are evidently private property but though he frequently saw these plantations plundered no penalty or punishment was the consequence of the crime  Language  THERE seems as I said before to be an affinity between the language of Easter Isle and that of OTaheitee though what is spoken at the latter was not understood at the former The natives indeed of Easter Island called the numbers by the same names as they do at OTaheitee and some other of their words are also similar  Eeya  implies a bone at OTaheitee whereas at Easter Island and New Zealand a bone is called  Eeka  The word friend at the Society Isles is expressed by  Hòa  at the Friendly Isles by  Wòa  and at Easter Isle by  Heeo  So that the language of Easter Island seems to be a dialect of the OTaheitean  Character c  ALTHOUGH these islanders have weapons of offence they are cowardly and timorous they stand in great awe of a musquet and probably from the ravage that was made among them by Roggewein and his people who without any provocations wantonly fired upon the natives and killed a great number of them but they are harmless and friendly have a natural mildness fellowfeeling and goodnature in their disposition which prompt them to treat their visitors kindly and as hospitably as their wretched country will admit They are frugal livers and good swimmers  Their ideas of decency are of course very different from those of nations accustomed to cloathing The women are neither reserved nor chaste but would sit down with the European seamen and undressing themselves would by smiles and lascivious gestures entice them to familiarities and both men and women notwithstanding their friendliness are exceedingly addicted to pilfering  Whether it be owing to filthiness or cleanliness I cannot take upon me to say but I  will not quit this people without observing that they have many wells on the island which are generally dirty for the natives never go to drink but they wash themselves all over as soon as they have done and let ever so many be together the first leaps right into the middle of the hole drinks and washes himself without the least ceremony after which another takes his place and does the same  THE MARQUESAS  WERE discovered by Alvara Mendana a Spaniard in and obtained from him the general name they now bear La Marquesas de Mendoça in honour of the Marquis of Cannete Viceroy of Peru as did the different isles their respective names The Marquesas are five in number La Magdalena St Pedro La Dominica Santa Christina and Hood's Island which last was a discovery of Captain Cook's in April Mendana having only seen the first four They occupy one degree in latitude and near half a degree in longitude Hood's Island is to the north of the rest and lies in ° ′ S latitude and ° W longitude and about five leagues and a half distant from the east point of  LA DOMINICA OR HEEVAROA  AS it is called by the natives which is the largest of all the isles being six leagues in length from east to west Its breadth is unequal but it is about fifteen or sixteen leagues round It is full of rugged hills rising in ridges directly from the seas these ridges are disjoined by deep vallies cloathed with wood as are the sides of some of the hills the aspect is however barren but it is nevertheless inhabited and as Santa Christina lies within a league of it an account of this island may be gathered from what is said of that Its latitude is ° ′ ″ S Four leagues and a half to the S from the east end of this island lies  ST PEDRO OR ONATEYO  AS it is called by the natives but whether inhabited or not is uncertain as it was never touched at it is about three leagues round  and lies high but nature has not been very bountiful to it  SANTA CHRISTINA OR WAITAHOO  AS it is called by the natives lies under the same parallel three or four leagues more to the W It is nine miles long in the direction of N and S about eight leagues round and about a league distant to the southward of La Dominica A narrow ridge of hills of considerable height extends the whole length of the island and there are other ridges with an equal ascent rising from the sea and joining the main ridge These are disjoined by deep narrow vallies extremely fertile clothed with fruit and other trees and watered by fine streams of excellent water The soil is a rich mould covering rocks containing volcanic productions which shew that this island like the Society Isles has had burning mountains  Productions  THE trees plants and other productions are nearly the same as at OTaheitee and the Society Isles  hogs fowls rats plantains yams cocoas sugarcanes and breadfruit  Inhabitants  THE islanders collectively are tawny but without exception the finest race of people in this sea for fine shape and regular features they surpass every one though the affinity of their language behaviour manners form dress provisions and canoes to those of OTaheitee shews that they are of the same nation and only differ from them in a few respects The men are beautifully  tattowed  or punctured from head to foot which gives them a dark colour the women but little young men and children not at all but are as fair as some Europeans The men in general are tall about six feet high Their teeth are not so good as those of the inhabitants of OTaheitee nor are their eyes so full and lively but their countenances are pleasing open and full of vivacity their hair like Europeans is of many colours except red The men wear their beards long and in different modes some part it and tie it in two bunches under the chin others plait it some wear it long and others quite short The features of the women are like those of  OTaheitee but what is most remarkable a deformed or illproportioned person is seldom if ever seen among them all are tall strong active and beautifully made  Dress  THEIR cloathing is the same as at OTaheitee and made of the same materials The men indeed in general go naked except a slip of cloth passed round the waist and between the legs The dress of the women is a piece of cloth wrapped round the waist like a petticoat hanging down below the middle of the leg and a loose mantle or tunic thrown over the shoulders Their chief headdress is a broad fillet neatly made of the fibres of the cocoanut husk in the front of which is fixed a mother of pearl shell cut round about the size of a saucer in the middle of which is another smaller of tortoiseshell pierced in a sort of fret work in the centre of which last is another piece of mother of pearl about the size of half a crown and in the centre of that a second piece of perforated tortoiseshell the size of a shilling so that the whole resembles the rose of a lady's slipper besides this ornament before some have them on each side but in smaller pieces and in  each of these roses are stuck a variety of tail feathers of the cock or tropic bird which when the fillet is tied upon the head stand upright and have a good effect They wear round the neck a necklace made of light wood on the upper edge of which are gummed on a row of red peas resembling beads They also wear round the legs and arms bunches of human hair or short feathers fastened to a string upon each ear they occasionally fix an oval piece of flat wood about three inches long so as to cover it which they paint white Their chiefs wear a kind of gorget made of wood studded with scarlet beans hanging from the neck upon the breast In very hot weather many make use of large fans to cool themselves made of stiff matting painted white Some also carry large feathered leaves by way of umbrella  Food  THE only material difference between the inhabitants of the Marquesas and those of the Society Isles is in the point of cleanliness the latter are the cleanest people under the sun they bathe two or three times a day and wash their hands and face before and after every meal The former bathe and wash but not so often nor are they  so nice in preparing their meals Their chief food is breadfruit which they roast when sufficiently done they mix it with water in a dirty wooden trough which at other times they feed their hogs from This mixture they scoop out with their hands and make of it a kind of fermented paste Their diet is principally vegetables though they occasionally eat hogs fowls and fish of which they catch great quantities They have no other drink than water for cocoanuts here are very scarce they have also the pepper root of which they make an intoxicating draught and which like the other islanders they present to strangers as a mark of friendship But if they are less cleanly than the OTaheiteans in their meals they are far more so in their evacuations Like the cats they hide their ordure which at OTaheitee is dropped and left exposed in every pathway  Habitations  THEIR houses are in the vallies and on the sides of the hills near their plantations They are built twenty or thirty together and form two sides of a square one north and south the other east and west with the parts adjoining wellpaved the  rest like an open place encompassed with thick trees Each house is erected on an elevated platform of stones it is built with bamboo canes closely connected together five or six feet high above which the roof rises to a ridge at the top consisting of small sticks and thatched with the leaves of the breadtree the platform on which it stands is generally about sixteen feet long and ten broad and erecting it on such a basis seems to intimate that the island at certain seasons is liable to be flooded They raise several of these platforms near their houses to sit on and regale The pavement within the house is covered with mats to sleep on The fronts of some houses are wholly open and a low doorway is cut in others  When Mendana was there in he took notice of a house at some distance from the town surrounded with palisades which he called an  Oracle  Captain Cook thinks he saw something of the same nature Mendana describes the house as containing some illcarved wooden figures and an altar on which was offered up a hog and some eatables his soldiers pulled it down notwithstanding the Indians opposed it intimating that they respected both the house and figures  Arms  THEIR weapons are clubs and spears resembling those of OTaheitee but rather neater They have also slings with which they throw stones with great velocity and to a great distance but not with a good aim In times of danger they beat an alarm with drums of the same kind with those of the Society Isles  Canoes  THEIR canoes are likewise very similar to those of OTaheitee but not so large They are from sixteen to twenty feet long and about fifteen inches broad The head and stern are made of two solid pieces of wood The head has a flat piece projecting horizontally from the body of the boat and on the end of this piece is coarsely carved a human face The stern rises or curves a little but irregularly and ends in a point They are worked on by short paddles sharp pointed and with a knob at the upper end made of a very hard wood Some have a sort of triangular latine sail made of matting with one of the angles downwards  Government and Character  NOTHING can be said with any certainty of their government They seem to consider themselves as one family of which the eldest born is the chief As they have not arrived at that degree of civilization visible at OTaheitee distinction of rank does not take place among them and their constitution has no regular form Accordingly no honours are paid to their chief all his preeminence consists in his dress The great sources of OTaheitean luxury the variety and great quantity of food and cloth do not exist at the Marquesas nor are the means of subsistence so easily attained this keeps the people upon a level but they have a competence they are active and healthy and have nothing to restrain them from following the dictates of nature Like those of the other South Sea Isles they are addicted to pilfering and the women almost as little reserved being extremely liberal of their favours to the Europeans that visited them They are in general a courteous friendly people and though one or two fatally felt the resentment of the English when they attempted  to pilfer they soon forgot the injury and buried their animosity in oblivion  LA MAGDALENA  LIES nearly in ° ′ S latitude and ° ′ W longitude It was only seen by Captain Cook in but was touched at by Mendana in It is from the account of his voyage therefore that the following particulars are collected  The island is about six leagues in circuit and lies ten leagues N by W from St Pedro It has high steep cliffs to the sea is mountainous with vallies where the Indians dwell and is very populous When he drew near the shore above four hundred of the natives in seventy vessels put off to the ship some swam and others were on floats They seemed to invite the Spaniards on shore They brought with them cocoanuts and plantains Above forty ventured on board and notwithstanding they were presented with a variety of things they could not help pilfering and being unwilling to retire when the captain desired it a great gun was fired in order to frighten them On  hearing this they all jumped overboard swam to their canoes and put themselves upon their defence A shell was sounded by way of alarm and a volley of stones from slings was immediately sent into the ship and others threatened with their lances but five or six being killed by musquet balls they soon held out boughs as signals of peace and all again was quiet  The inhabitants of La Magdalena are white and of a gentle disposition large stoutlimbed and so well shaped as greatly to exceed the Spaniards they have beautiful teeth eyes and mouths delicate fine hands and feet long fingers flowing hair which they tie and plait and amongst them some of the most beautiful boys ever seen all of them naked and without the least covering and many of them were very ruddy they are of European stature and they  tattow  or puncture their bodies and faces with the figures of fish and other forms  Indeed there is reason to believe that the natives of the Marquesas are all of one and the same tribe and converse and trade together What then has been said of St Christina will hold good with respect to the rest  THE FRIENDLY ISLES  ARE about sixteen days sail W from the Society Isles they lie between ° ′ and ° ′ S latitude and ° and ° ′ W longitude from Greenwich and consist of Amsterdam or  Tongatabu  Middleburg or  Eaoowe  Rotterdam or  Anamocka  the Isle of Handsome People Cocos Traitors Horne and some lesser isles adjacent They received their name of Friendly from the firm alliance that subsists among the inhabitants and from the friendly reception Captain Cook c received there in for even the first discovers met with in general a peaceful welcome  MIDDLEBURG AND AMSTERDAM  MIDDLEBURG or as it is called by the natives  Eaoowe  is about ten leagues in circumference and may be seen at the distance of  twelve leagues it lies in ° ′ S latitude and ° ′ W longitude and was first discovered and named by Captain Abel Tasman a Dutchman in January  Face of the Country  THE borders of this isle at the bottom of the hills consist of plantations of bananas and groves of cocoanut trees but the inner parts are but little cultivated though the soil is of a nature to admit of it The hills are not higher than those of the Isle of Wight and in many places decorated with clumps of trees Glades are frequently met with covered with thick grass and winding paths beautiful by nature leading to every part  Amsterdam or as it is called by the natives  Tongatabu  was also discovered by and received its name from Captain Tasman in January it lies in ° ′ S latitude and ° W longitude is to the northward of Middleburg and about five leagues from it it is something in the form of an Isoceles triangle the longest sides of which are seven leagues long the shortest about four its direction is nearly E S E and W N W It lies low not exceeding in any place eighty  feet above the level of the water Both this and Middleburg are protected from the encroachments of the sea by reefs of coral rocks and they have some snug harbours but there is a scarcity of fresh water in these islands  The Isle of Amsterdam is every where planted with breadfruit cocoanut trees plantains sugarcane a fruit resembling a nectarine and most of those that are the produce of the Society Isles with some few that were not met with there and Captain Cook in October left the inhabitants an assortment of European seeds The high state of cultivation this island is in must have cost the natives immense labour but they are amply rewarded by the great produce of which every one seems to partake  Persons  THE natives both male and female are in size like Europeans their complexion a uniform lightish copper their hair in general black They are wellshaped and elegantly formed have a regular set of features mild and pleasing fine eyes and good teeth their faces are somewhat different from the inhabitants of OTaheitee  being not so round their noses not so flat and their lips not so thick  The hands and arms of the women are full as delicate as those of the natives of OTaheitee but like them their feet and legs are large in proportion to the body The men puncture their skin here likewise upon the thighs breech and hips but the women do not the only marks of this kind on them are about the arms and fingers and this very sparingly  Dress  THE dress both of men and women consists of a piece of cloth or matting tied round the waist so as to hang below the knees the upper part of the body being generally naked This seems to be the dress of the women only when Tasman was there in for the men at that time went quite naked except a small covering over their private parts The men frequently wear a string round their necks by which a shell of mother of pearl hangs down on the breast and the women loose necklaces made of shell fishteeth and seeds intermixed The women also wear on their fingers neat tortoiseshell rings and both men and women through the bottom of their ears cylindrical pieces about the size of a small quill  Both sexes wear their hair short and most of them comb it upwards the boys seldom have more than a lock on the crown of their heads and a little on each side and the men shave their faces with shells a deviation from what was customary in when they wore whiskers and let part of their beard grow so as to be about three or four fingers in breadth and about a quarter of an inch in length  They have a custom here also of powdering their hair with powder of different colours some with white made of a kind of lime which burns the hair others with blue and others with orange colour made of turmeric  Habitations  HERE are no towns or villages the chief part of the houses are built in enclosed plantations where convenience is more studied than order They are similar to those of OTaheitee except that the floor is a little raised and covered with thick matting of delicate texture and beautiful colours They are also inclosed on the windward side with matting and have within a moveable screen made of wickerwork to part off their bedplaces The roof is formed with a number of spars and round sticks and covered with matting made of banana leaves Their furniture  consists only of a few wooden platters cocoanut shells small square cups made of banana leaves curiously folded and some neat wooden stools on four legs to rest the head on at night by way of pillow when their clothing serves them for a covering A few pipkins and other earthen vessels were seen by Captain Cook in but he believed them to be the remains of what were presented to the natives by Captain Tasman in  Language  THE language of these islands is nearly the same with that of OTaheitee and the Society Isles the difference not being greater than that between the northern and western dialects of England it is not however so harmonious being more replete with consonants  Animals  THEIR domestic animals are hogs only and fowls Hogs like those of other isles in this sea but the fowls were remarkably large and fine flavoured equal if not superior to European poultry They have no rats here nor any quadrupeds except lizards Captain Cook left a dog and bitch there in The land birds are pidgeons  doves parrots parroquets owls blue baldcoots large bats that measure from three to four feet between the extremities of the wings when expanded and a great variety of uncommon small birds  Manufactures c  THEY make the same kind of cloth here as they do at OTaheitee though not of so many sorts nor any near so fine but they have a way of sizing it so as to keep out the rain They dye it of various tints by dyes made from vegetables black brown purple yellow and red They make also matting of fine texture which occasionally serves for cloathing and some of stronger texture for flooring and to serve as sails Of their matting they make a variety of baskets and some also from the twisted fibres of the cocoanut which they stud with beads formed from shells and bones They have the neatest ornamental combs ever seen consisting of a number of little flat sticks about five inches long firmly and elegantly connected together by cocoanut fibres and a variety of fishingtackle Their working tools are made of stone bone shell c as at the other islands and when we see the work performed by them  we hardly know which to admire most the ingenuity or the patience of the workman  Arms  THE clubs of these islanders wear a variety of forms and are in general so heavy as not to be managed with one hand and they are prettily carved and polished They have also spears and sharppointed sticks some of which are barbed and bows and arrows of a singular construction The bow is six feet long about the size of one's little finger and when slack forms a curve the convex part has a groove in it that holds the string in drawing the bow instead of pulling it so as to encrease the natural curvature they draw it the reverse way so that the spring to recover its former position gives greater velocity to the arrow and the recoil never hurts the arm of the bowman It is probable that they are often at war with their neighbours from the great quantity of arms in their possession  Boats  THEIR canoes in point of neatness and workmanship exceed every thing of the kind met with in the South Seas They are constructed of several planks sewed together so neatly that the joints on the outside  are scarcely to be seen Some of their canoes are double and some single the single ones are from twenty to thirty feet long about twenty inches wide in the middle terminating at each end in a point At the ends are a kind of deck about ten feet long so that the canoe is open in the middle and they frequently decorate their decks with rows of white shells Some of them have sails and some are worked on with paddles The double canoes are formed of two fastened together by strong beams and a boarded platform is raised upon staunchions over them They are so contrived that they can be sunk under water quite to the platform without being in any danger of filling nor can they sink while they hold together They are in general sixty or seventy feet long and four or five broad They have one mast in the middle and one sail made of matting Their rope is exactly like ours and some of it four or five inches thick On this platform is built a little shed to shelter the crew from the weather and they carry on it a moveable firehearth to dress their provisions which is a wooden trough filled with stones the whole canoe thus constructed is as well finished and well polished as our best cabinetwork in England  Amusements c  IT is not sufficiently known how these people amuse themselves at their leisure hours all that can be said on this head is that they frequently sing in parts and accompany the song with a snapping of their singers Their voices are sweet and mellow and they sing in time and tune much superior to the natives of the Society Isles They have a large bambo flute with eight stops which they sound like a German flute but by the nostrils and they have a musical instrument formed of eight or ten reeds of different lengths joined together resembling the ancient Doric pipe which they sound by the breath sliding the instrument to and fro along the lips They have also a drum formed of a piece of hollow wood on the sides of which they beat with sticks and produce a noise something like that which may be produced from an empty cask  They are great swimmers and divers and the women further amuse themselves at times by slinging five or six balls continually into the air and catching them alternately and frequently they dance and their dances are of the dramatic kind  Diseases  A leprous disorder seems to be general here and to acquire a great degree of virulence but let their ulcers be ever so bad they appear to disregard them To cure this or some other disorder they blister upon the cheekbones for these marks are so universal that most of the islanders must have been sorely afflicted with disease at one time or other  Religion  VERY little is known of their religion all that can be said of it is that they do not seem to be idolaters nor like the people of OTaheitee to hold any particular birds in veneration but to worship a supreme invisible Being The religious notions of a people are indeed the last things a stranger becomes acquainted with who is with them but a few days owing to an imperfect knowledge of their language besides as I mentioned before the terms in which the natives of the South Seas express their religious mysteries are different from such as are in general use of course it is difficult to get at them  As their burying places or places of worship are different from any thing yet mentioned I  will describe one They are generally erected upon a green mount raised by hand sixteen or eighteen feet above the level of the common ground which mount is of an oblong figure and enclosed by a stone wall about three feet high From this wall the mount rises gradually and is turfed on the top of it stands the house of worship similar in figure to the mount on which it stands about twenty feet long and sixteen broad and has a gravel walk round it in the front are two stone steps leading to the top of the wall the house is built like their dwellinghouses only it is enclosed with strong matting within the floor is gravelled the middle part eight feet in length is raised about six inches above it and paved with pebbles and this generally is the grave of some respectable person a carved image or two stuck up upon poles decorate the walls  These buildings are called  Afiatouca  and they are generally seen where two roads cross each other At particular times the priest addresses himself to these buildings in certain set speeches and prayers but of what kind I cannot say  Government  FROM what could be collected from the natives the government is much like that of OTaheitee that is under certain chiefs subordinate to a sovereign All the land at Amsterdam Island appears to be private property but there are here a class of people who are slaves and have no property at all  Customs  ONE hundred and thirty years do not seem to have made any change in the customs and manners of this people What Captain Tasman observed in Captain Cook observed in The mode of saluting each other is by touching or meeting noses though such as wish to express a greater regard will embrace each other and kiss the hands and the sign of peace to strangers is the display of white flags and a still greater testimony of friendship is a reciprocal exchange of names Whatever they are pleased to accept they immediately raise to their heads and this grateful acceptance is taught them from their childhood The intoxicating juice from the pepperroot of which they are very choice they offer to strangers as a mark of civility  But the most singular custom among them is the cutting off one or both of their little fingers which they do on the death of a parent or near relation Many of the islanders carry about with them pidgeons perched on crooked sticks these possibly may be marks or badges of honour for at Horne Island they are carried by persons of distinction in the presence of a chief in the same manner as falcons formerly were carried by the nobility in Europe  General character c  THE general character of the natives is that they are friendly brave and courteous The women are mostly modest and reserved particularly the married ones but as in all countries there are some of easy virtue so are there in these islands women who will invite your embraces by immodest words and gestures The women in general are the merriest creatures in life they will if we seem pleased with it chatter by one's side without any invitation and without considering whether they are understood or not But these as well as the men have a strong propensity to pilfering They are far more industrious here then at OTaheitee and this accounts for the regularity of their  plantations and their nice division of property Though their political constitution does not appear favourable to liberty and easiness of mind yet they preserve a happiness of temper The climate is very good between the extremes of heat and cold and individuals are seldom seen to be sick or lame they feel no wants which they are unable to gratify and joy and contentment are painted in every face  ROTTERDAM ISLAND  OR as the natives call it  Anamocka  lies about a day's sail to the N E of Amsterdam with which the natives have an intercourse it is in ° ′ S latitude and ° ′ W longitude from Greenwich and has a variety of small isles in its neighbourhood It was first discovered by Captain Abel Tasman in January and received its name from him he met with a friendly welcome and continued there about two days and it was not visited again by any European till Captain Cook touched there in June  About eleven or twelve leagues N N W half W from Rotterdam lie two islands both of which are inhabited but not very fertile they are called  Amattafoa  and  Oghao  the former is about fifteen miles round the latter not so much Amattafoa is a volcano and has a crater  Anamocka  is in the form of a triangle about three or four miles long on each side and the greatest part of its surface is covered by a saltwater lake It consists of a coral rock covered with mould which is exceedingly fertile and abounds with fine groves  The productions canoes inhabitants dress customs and language are exactly similar with those at Amsterdam and they seem to have plenty of waterhens and quantities of shaddock which is a delicious fruit With respect to their religion and government nothing can be particularly said of it but as there is a coincidence of customs and manners among these islanders and their neighbours it is natural to suppose that they imitate them also in their religious and constitutional policy though they have no burying places upon the island  The natives seem to be here more afflicted with the leprosy than their neighbours This  disorder breaks out in the face more than in any other part of the body so as to destroy the nose and indeed the whole face which is sometimes one continued putrid ulcer They heal simple wounds with the pulp of the sugarcane  The houses here are different from any thing before mentioned they are an oblong square about thirty feet long eight feet wide and they are built about nine feet in height and their walls and sides are about four feet high and made of reeds fixed up not perpendicularly but converging from the eaves of the roof to the bottom The roof is ridged at the top so that a section of the whole would resemble a pentagon It is thatched and the roof spreads a good way beyond the sloping walls In one of the long sides there is an opening like a window which is the only entrance into it Within are stored quantities of yams which is probably the chief support of the natives On these they sleep covered only with a little matting they rest their heads on narrow stools as do the OTaheiteans In the day time they lie under sheds the floors of which are covered with mats They have a variety of large wooden dishes and bowls and  some earthen pots which seem to have been long in use and may be the manufacture of some neighbouring isle  Captain Cook met with a very good reception from the inhabitants and was no sooner landed than an old woman presented a beautiful girl to him and gave him to understand that she was at his service indeed a number of women put off to the ship and tendered themselves to the sailors for the same purpose  The natives who are happy enough to call the rich plantations in this island their own are hospitable and brave but as they were in so are they nowvery much addicted to pilfering The healthy climate and excellent productions seem to gratify them in all their wants their general turn is to be active and industrious but their behaviour to strangers is rather polite than cordial  ISLA DE LA GENTE HERMOSA OR ISLAND OF HANDSOME PEOPLE  LIES about eighteen or nineteen days sail N W by W of OTaheitee in ° S latitude and ° E longitude from London Its direction is N and S and it is about eighteen miles round It was first discovered by De Quiros who touched there in March and tells us that notwithstanding the natives of this island are exposed to the rigour of the sun the air and cold reason enough for burning up their skins till they are as black as negroes yet they are extremely white and beautiful particularly the women and being graceful in their persons and modest in their carriage would if cloathed in an European dress eclipse the ladies in his country They are naked covered only from the waist downwards with neat wellmade white mats composed of the palm throwing over their shoulders occasionally a mantle of the same kind Though a barbarous people they seem in general well disposed and De Quiros however  did not meet with a very friendly reception Some of the ship's people in search of fresh water were opposed by ten or twelve of the Indians who attacked them with missile darts having sharp burnt points and large black clubs but the men with their swords and targets alone soon overcame them As a proof of their bravery however it must be told that a naked savage armed only with a club fought more than twenty wellarmed soldiers and stood against them and though fatigued and overpowered with numbers and spent with the loss of blood he dropped dead biting the earth with revengeful agonies Their signs of peace are carrying burning torches in their hands made with sticks dipped in a kind of rosin  The houses here are thatched stand together in clusters and resemble towns and their canoes are made of a tree hollowed out and are extremely fleet  As De Quiros made but a very short stay here and it has not been visited since by any European no farther account of the island can be given except what he collected from a native of an isle called Taumaco in the neighbourhood whom he brought with him as far as Acapulco on his return This island is  reckoned one thousand two hundred and fifty leagues distant from Mexico and is in ° S latitude and about ° E longitude from London From this Indian he learnt that there are islands called Chicayana not farther than about four days sail from Taumaco whose inhabitants have long loose hair that they puncture themselves as he was in the face arms and breast that there are also white people on that island with long red hair and that they are also mulattoes with curled hair that at Taumaco there are many stones impregnated with silver and plenty of oysters in which they find large white pearls as big as a small plumb and that such are to be found at all the islands in that neighbourhood that they called the devil  Terua  and that without being seen he frequently talked to the people from a piece of wood particularly at night that he would sometimes touch their cheeks and breast with something very cold that he had often felt it himself and that before De Quiros was at Taumaco the devil had told several that a number of strangers were coming to kill them  He said very little of the constitution of the island except that they hanged people for murder  COCOS AND TRAITOR's ISLES  ARE situated in ° ′ S latitude and ° ′ W longitude from Greenwich and were first discovered by Schouten in and afterwards visited by Wallis in July They are about a league distant from each other  Cocos or Boseawen's Isle as it was called by Captain Wallis in honour of Admiral Boscawen is a high mountain in appearance like a sugar loaf it is in ° ′ S latitude and ° W longitude it is nearly circular and three miles over It was called Cocos Isle by Schouten from its being full of cocoanut trees  When Schouten approached the land a number of canoes put off from shore with cocoanuts and yams and when they were pretty near the ship the Indians jumped into the water with their provisions in their hands for they are excellent swimmers and coming up the ship's side exchanged them for nails and strings of beads As the ship's boat was going on shore the natives of Traitor's Isle in canoes surrounded  it and endeavoured to take it being armed with staves of hard wood pointed and burnt at the end on which the sailors in defence of themselves fired amongst them two or three times but without effect This they laughed at but on their leader's being killed at another fire they dispersed  Traitor's Isle as it was called by Schouten from the reception he met with or Keppel's Isle as it was afterwards named by Wallis in compliment to Admiral Keppel lies in ° ′ S and longitude ° ′ W is three miles and a half long and two miles broad and is much less elevated from the sea than Cocos  The natives of Traitor's Isle are a poor people little better than savages without a chief or conductor They were cloathed when Schouten was there all round with rushes having strings about their necks to which hung the shell of a snail or mother of pearl When Wallis was at Traitor's Isle in the inhabitants were clothed in matting and were without the first joint of their little fingers Those of Cocos are a handsome robust wellmade people of large stature Some wear their hair short some curled some long and  others tied in tresses of various kinds The flaps of their ears are slit and hang down almost as low as their shoulders they wear whiskers and a little beard under the chin the rest being all shaven and their bodies are marked or  tattowed  in like manner as the islanders of OTaheitee  In a chief put off from the shore in a canoe covered with a mat in form of a tent and accompanied with a number of people in thirtyfive canoes as they approached Schouten's ship the chief cried out three times with a loud voice and at the fourth all his company joined in the cry He presented the captain with a paper dress and a fine mat and he was entertained and received presents in his turn These people certainly had no idea of property attempting to steal every thing they could lay their hands upon nay they tried to draw out the nails from the ship's side with their teeth and some swam under the keel and attempted to draw the nails from thence but being fired at they desisted The next day however they put off from shore to the number of one thousand with hogs bananas fowls and cocoanuts of which they have plenty under a pretence of trading and  the chief or  Latou  as he is there called in a double canoe giving a signal they all shouted and at that instant threw a volley of stones on board the ship and the chief was absurd enough to suppose that he could run down the ship by sailing against it with his canoe he made the ridiculous attempt and beat the head of his canoe to pieces this exasperated the Indians and they reanimated their attack but on a discharge of some musquets and a few great guns they were soon put to flight and with very little slaughter  The canoes of these islanders are made of one piece of red wood flat before and pointed behind they dart along very fast in them steering them and putting them on with two oars astern They have other canoes that carry a sail in the middle of which is generally drawn a grey and red cock and a large piece of wood on the larboard side with which they keep the vessel upright on this wood is a fishgig a kind of prong to strike fish always ready for use  It is worthy of a remark on the islands in these seas that though no kind of metal was found in them yet the inhabitants in general as soon as they got a piece of iron began to sharpen  it which they never attempted to do with either brass or copper  HORNE OR HOORN  LIES in ° ′ S latitude and ° E longitude from Greenwich and was discovered also in by Captain William Schouten who sailed from Holland It is computed to lie leagues W of Peru When Schouten's ship was near the land the natives put off from the shore in canoes as did the people at Cocos and Traitor's Isle and when on board attempted to steal every thing in their way on being opposed they became unruly but a shot or two soon quieted these as it did the others After this they brought branches of trees and white flags as symbols of peace and invited the ship's company on shore which when hostages were exchanged on both sides was complied with  The hostages sent from on shore were apparently men of distinction and accompanied to the vessel by two young men their sons as handsome genteel and well made as one would wish to see with fine open countenances  good hair and good eyes The purser who went as hostage from the ship was received by the chief of the island whom they called the  Herico  with great ceremony and humility bowing himself and laying prostrate before him for near half an hour A man of distinction near the chief threw himself down also weeping like a child and with the greatest abaisance took the purser's foot and laid it upon his own neck When more of the ship's company went on shore the chief and his son the viceroy took off their crowns and put them on the sailors heads these crowns were made of long white feathers tipped with others red and green those of the paroquet The Indians of distinction round the chief carried each a pigeon perched on a little stick These pigeons are white above to the wings the rest black except on the belly where the feathers are reddish They have a fish here resembling a bat on account of the largeness of the head and body smallness of the tail and great extent of a pair of fins which resemble wings the skin of this fish is spotted like a sparrowhawk  The men of this island are tall large well made and strong bodied they are fast runners  expert swimmers and good divers Their complexion is a yellow brown and they take great pleasure in dressing their hair which is black Some tie it others frize it and others curl it some let it grow down to the waist and tie it in five or six tails and others dress it right an end standing up like hog's bristles ten or eleven inches long but they do not suffer the beard to grow  The women are very much deformed both in face and body and are short Their breasts are long and hang down to their bellies like leather bags of course they are very ugly and at the same time they are very immodest performing the rites of Venus in the presence of every one only under a mat Both men and women go naked except a piece of covering between their legs and the women rub their heads and cheeks with something red  Their land produces spontaneously a great variety of fruits such as cocoas bananas yams c for they know nothing of cultivation and at low water the women catch fish which is eaten raw They have also some hogs which they cook wretchedly  They seem to have very little notion of merchandize and no great appearance of religion though when the chief came on board the ship he fell on his face and said something like a prayer but there is a kind of subordination to superiors among them for one of them having stolen a sword from on board the ship on a complaint to the chief the sword was returned and the man that stole it bastinadoed and given to understand by his king that if he did so again he should lose his head  The houses or huts of the natives are erected along the shore as thick as they can stand They are built with leaves of trees in form of a haycock about twentyfive feet round and ten or twelve feet high with a door so low that they are obliged to stoop to get in They have no furniture within except a fishgig or staff and in some a wooden club which seems to be all the weapon they have and a little dry grass like hay to sleep on  The canoes of this island are made with much skill and have an outrigger neither the head nor the stern is raised but there is a kind of deck over each of them and in the middle of these is a row of wooden pegs  with heads like nails covered with fine white shells The sail is triangular composed of several matts two of its sides are bent to two sticks one of which supports it up along the mat the other answers the purpose of a boom  The natives are upon the whole a lively people and seemed to enjoy dancing with the sailors and some of Captain Schouten's people found a number of young girls dancing before the chief by moonlight quite naked to the sound of an instrument made in form of a pump I must not forget to mention that they have a wonderful way of climbing a rock or tree expeditiously by winding a band round the feet  While the Europeans were there the chief of a neighbouring isle came to visit the chief of Horne and Captain Schouten was present at the meeting which he thus describes When the two chiefs approached each other they threw themselves prostrate on the ground as in an act of adoration and clapped their hands they then rose up and seated themselves on the ground under a shed upon two mats then a number of the natives more than three hundred who brought with them round their waists a quantity of a green plant called by  them  Kava  chewed it and spit it out into a great trough when they had thus prepared a sufficient quantity of this masticated herb they poured water on it and mixed it and squeezed it together straining it with tow and gave it to their chiefs to drink they next served up plenty of roasted yams and sixteen hogs quite bloody out of which they had only taken the guts without washing them and put a few hot stones in the bellies to roast them within this with burning the bristles a little is what they call cooking the dishes were carried on the heads of the attendants who kneeled down and thus placed them before the chief nine hundred people were assembled on this occasion and when the chiefs had dined they fell to upon the remainder  THE NEW HEBRIDES  CONSIST of the following islands Tierra del Espiritu Santo Isle of St Bartholomew Mallicolo Sandwich Isle Erromango Tanna Apee Ambrym Whitsuntide Isle Aurora Isle Isle of Lepers and some few smaller Isles in their neighbourhood They are about eighteen days sail from the Friendly Isles and lie between ° ′ and ° ′ S latitude and ° ′ and ° ′ E longitude from Greenwich They received their name from Captain Cook in from the Hebrides of Great Britain those being the westermost isles on our coast  TIERRA DEL ESPIRITU SANTO  WAS first discovered by De Quiros in it lies in ° ′ S latitude and ° ′ E longitude from Greenwich It is the westermost and lies farthest north of all the Hebrides is the largest of the whole and is twentytwo leagues long in the direction of N N W half W and S S E half E twelve broad and sixty round The land to the W is very mountainous the hills frequently rising immediately from the sea Every part of it except the cliffs and beeches is covered with trees and plantations and every valley watered with a stream It has a remarkable fine bay on the north side called by De Quiros St Philip and St Jago it being St Philip's and St James's day when he entered it It has almost twenty leagues of sea shore is eight leagues at the mouth and is unfathomable  In this bay is a fine anchoring place from two to forty fathoms called Vera Cruz and capacious enough to hold one thousand ships with clear soundings  The island is exceedingly fertile and produces spontaneously cocoanuts potatoes yams oranges limes almonds nutmegs sweet basil c An uncommonly luxuriant vegetation was every where seen  With respect to animals as De Quiros's people were only once on shore and Captain Cook merely sailed round the island it cannot be said with any certainty that they abound with cattle De Quiros believes they had plenty but a great number of hogs were seen also honeybees fowls doves parrots partridges swallows and a variety of small birds and Captain Cook when he was there met with a booby  The natives are taller stouter and better shaped than those of Mallicolo to which I must refer the reader and of the same colour with the Mallicolese Their hair like theirs also is black short and frizzled some were observed to have it long tied up on the crown of the head and ornamented with feathers They go naked except two long slips of matting five inches broad hanging down before and behind from the waist to the knees and fastened round the middle by a girdle Some  wear bracelets and necklaces of shells and others wear a white shell tied on the forehead  They seem to speak a language similar to that at Anamocka for they understood many of the terms of that island and their houses are thatched and low  Their canoes have triangular sails but are very indifferently made like those of Mallicolo and they have outriggers  When De Quiros touched there some of his people went on shore and endeavoured to make peace with the Indians but one among them apparently a chief making a line on the ground with a bow gave a sign that they should not pass it but this not being complied with the barbarians let fly a volley of arrows which was returned by a volley of balls that killed some particularly the chief and dispersed the rest Twentyfive soldiers soon after getting up the side of a mountain in quest of provisions heard the noise of drums made of hollow wood and some shoutings of the natives and were attacked as before but they again repulsed them in the same manner Thus it appears that they had bows and arrows in but in when Captain Cook was there  they seemed to have no other weapons than darts and fishgigs  MALLICOLO  IS the next in size being eighteen leagues long in the direction of N W and S E Its greatest breadth which is at the S E end is eight leagues the other end is about six leagues broad and in the middle it is near a league wide It was first touched at by Captain Cook in July though it was heard of by De Quiros in and seen by Bouganville in On the N E side it has a good harbour now called Port Sandwich which lies in ° ′ ″ S latitude and ° ′ ″ E longitude  Productions  ITS mountains are very high and abound with forests The soil is rich and fertile and its productions are luxuriant and in great variety There are plenty of cocoanuts breadfruit sugarcanes yams turmeric and oranges Hogs and common poultry are their domestic animals but the natives had no dogs till Captain  Cook left them two puppies male and female they possibly may have other animals but as the ship continued there but one day this point cannot be ascertained They have however a variety of small birds and upon the coast is caught a poisonous fish called a  Red Seabream  which if eaten in any quantity will prove fatal  The island has all the appearance of being very populous and the inhabitants seem dispersed over the whole extent of the country  Climate  THE climate of Mallicolo and the adjacent isles is very warm Farenheit's thermometer in July was between ° and °  Persons and Dress  THE people are the most ugly and illproportioned of any met with in the South Seas they are very darkcoloured and of a slender and diminutive size with long heads flat faces and monkeycountenances which they paint black yet they are sprightly and are quick of comprehension Their lips and lower part of their faces are nothing like the Guinea negroes but their noses are exactly similar and  the substance of their hair the same woolly black or brown short and curly Their beards are short strong crisp and bushy their foreheads are flat and probably depressed so in their infancy and what adds to their ugliness is a cord about as thick as one's finger which they accustom themselves to tie so tight round the belly that it would prove fatal to those who were not accustomed to it from their childhood They seem almost to be cut in two with it the cord being lost as it were in the flesh The men go quite naked except a piece of cloth or leaf in which they wrap their private parts and tie up the end to the cord round their waist so that this covering rather displays than conceals what they pretend to hide They wear bracelets on the upper part of the arm made with thread and shells four or five inches broad these they put on when young and never take off so that part of the arm is considerably smaller than the other And by way of further ornament they bore the septum of their noses that part that divides the nostrils and wear a piece of white stone in it curved and about an inch and an half long which hangs out at each nostril They wear also round the right wrist hogs tusks bent circular  and round the left a round piece of wood to ward of the string of the bow and on their breast hangs a shell suspended by a string round their necks Some wear tortoiseshell earrings and others rings of shells  The women are not less ugly than the men for they paint their heads and faces red and yellow and also their shoulders over which some wear a kind of petticoat others a bag in which they carry their children made of a kind of cloth Fullgrown women wear short pieces of cloth or matting round their waists reaching nearly to their knees others have only a string round their middle with a wisp of straw between the legs and girls as do the boys go quite naked Wearing of ornaments seems to be the privilege only of the men  Weapons  THEIR weapons are clubs and spears made of a hard wood and bows and arrows Their bows are about four feet long made of a dark brown stick like mahogany split through the middle are strong elastic and nicely polished and their arrows a kind of reed pointed with hard wood or bone dipped in poison which they keep in a fort of quiver made of leaves the points of  these arrows are jagged to prevent their being readily drawn out of the wounds Their clubs are highly polished and they sling them round their shoulders by a thick rope made of grass  Language  THE people of Mallicolo seem to be quite a different nation from those of the Friendly or Society Isles and speak a different language It contains a number of consonants but yet is not difficult to pronounce The most singular articulation is that of the  Brrr Mambrrùm  and  Bonombrrooài  are proper names They can pronounce most English words with ease Admiration they express by hissing  Habitations  THEIR dwellings are small wretched hovels so low that they can hardly stand upright in them and consist merely of a roof resting on a few posts and thatched with palm leaves Some few are enclosed with boards and the entrance is by a square hole at one end  Canoes  THEIR canoes are like those of the neighbouring isles  Amusements  THEY seem to be a chearful people and pass away great part of their time in music and dancing Their instruments without doubt are very simple for none were seen but drums and pipes which are readily made Their drums serve also to sound an alarm in cases of danger  Custom and Character  NOTHING can be said either of their religion or government and the only customs observed were the signs of amity such as presenting green boughs and sprinkling water upon the head with the hand something like the people of New Guinea The women here are timid and seem to be treated with very little respect Both men and women coveted almost every thing they saw but never repined at a refusal or attempted to pilfer They are expert swimmers chearful good humoured and chatty and seem very friendly disposed have quick parts and appear only to want an ambitious individual or two to spur them on to a higher state of civilization  When Captain Cook landed here he met with a friendly reception but while he lay at  anchor a number of the natives put off in their canoes and one more forward than the rest on being refused by him admittance into the ship pointed his bow and arrow at him and received as a reward a charge of small shot in his face It staggered him but did not make him drop his bow till he was fired at a second time This declaration of war put them on their defence but the firing a cannonball over their heads among the trees frightened and dispersed them all  ST BARTHOLOMEW ISLE  LIES between the S end of Tierra del Espiritu Santo and the N end of Mallicolo distant from Mallicolo about eight miles its latitude is S ° ′ and longitude E ° ′ It is about six or seven leagues in circumference and was named Saint Bartholomew by Captain Cook it being on that day he discovered it  THE ISLE OF LEPERS  LIES between Espiritu Santo and Aurora Island eight leagues from the former and three from the latter in latitude ° ′ S and ° ′ E longitude It is in form like an egg very high land and about twenty leagues round It was first discovered by M De Bouganville in and from him received its name from its leprous inhabitants  Some of the ship's crew went on shore and were approached by a numerous troop of islanders armed with bows and arrows and stones ready to cast They began hostilities but a discharge or two from the musquetry soon quieted them  These islanders are of two colours black and mulattoes they have thick lips and their hair is woolly which they powder with turmeric and give it a yellow cast but they do not wear a beard They are short ugly illmade and in general infected with leprosy They wear an ornament in their noses like the Mallicolese and the same kind of bracelets and necklaces The men go naked scarcely covering  their nudities The women are not less disagreeable than the men and wear bandages on their backs by which they carry their children On their cloth they paint many pretty designs with a fine crimson  Their arms are bows and arrows and clubs of hard wood like those at Mallicolo stones they also use as weapons of offence but they cast them without slings They have also sabres of hard wood Their canoes are like those of their neighbours  The whole island is covered with trees the soil is very light and of no great depth There are many paths through the woods and places enclosed three feet high with reed fences Their huts are low and could not be entered but by creeping They have here productions in common with their neighbours and a particular species of figs  WHITSUNTIDE ISLE AURORA AMBRYM APEE AND SANDWICH ISLES  LIE all nearly under the same meridian of ° ′ E extending from the latitude  of ° ′ ″ to ° ′ ″ and are all inhabited  WHITSUNTIDE ISLE  IS one league and an half to the S of Aurora is eleven leagues long and about three broad lying N and S it was first discovered by M De Bouganville on Whitsunday and from him received its name The land is very high and covered with trees except where there are plantations which are numerous  AURORA ISLE  LIES N by W and S by E and is also eleven leagues long and from two to two and a half broad it lies high and has a hilly surface covered with wood except where the natives dwell It enjoys the most luxuriant vegetation that can be conceived numberless climbers winding up the trees forming beautiful festoons This island owes its discovery and name also to Bouganville in  AMBRYM  IS about seven leagues in length in S latitude ° ′ and E longitude ° ′ and has a volcano on it but very rich and fertile  APEE  IS distant from Ambrym about five leagues and not less than twenty leagues round its longest direction is about eight leagues N W and S E It is very high land richly diversified with woods and lawns These last two are the discovery of Captain Cook in  SANDWICH ISLE  WAS also discovered by him at the same time and so called in compliment to Lord Sandwich This isle is ten leagues long in the direction of N W by W and S E by E twentytwo leagues S S E half E from Mallicolo  and is twentyfive leagues round It exhibits a delightful view the hills gently sloping to the sea and spotted with woods and lawns  ERROMANGO  LIES eighteen leagues from Sandwich Isle in S latitude ° ′ and ° ′ E longitude and is about twentyfive leagues in circuit It was discovered by Captain Cook When he drew near the coast the natives in great numbers flocked to the sea side and made signals of invitation accordingly he went ashore and was received apparently in a very friendly manner but on their wishing him to draw the ship's boat upon dry land and his refusing it they made an attempt to drag it by force which obliged him to give orders to his men to fire this dispersed them with the loss only of three or four of their number They were armed with bows and arrows darts and stones which they every now and then came out of ambush and cast so as to wound one or two of the ship's company but on the  great guns being fired from the ship they dispersed and all was quiet  These islanders seem to be of a different race from those of Mallicolo and speak a different language They are a middlesized people with good shapes and tolerable features very black and they paint their faces some with black and others with red pigment Their hair is curly crisp and woolly The women are ugly and wear a sort of petticoat made of the leaves of some plant but the men like those of Mallicolo have only a belt round the waist and their privities enclosed in a wrapper They live in thatched huts and lay out their plantations by line but they have no canoes  TANNA  IS the last of these isles to the southward it lies six leagues S of Erromango about eight leagues long in the direction S E by S and N W by N and about three or four leagues broad its latitude is ° ′ and longitude ° ′ E It was discovered by Captain Cook in  Face of the Country  UPON this island there are many ponds of stagnant water where the natives plant great quantities of eddoes The cocoapalms form spacious groves full of different shrubberies affording a fragrant and refreshing smell Several sorts of blossoms embellish the tufted foliage and the most beautiful bindweeds wind like ivy to the tops of the tallest trees and adorn them with wreathes of blue and purple flowers There is a hot spring in this island coming out of a rock close to the edge of the sea whose degree of heat is such that the finger cannot be held in it longer than a single second A thermometer that stood at ° on board the ship plunged in this spring rose to ° in the space of five minutes and in another place to ½° Some small shellfish thrown into it were boiled in two or three minutes so that it is but little colder than boiling water A piece of silver after laying in the water above half an hour came out perfectly bright and untarnished and salt of tartar had no visible effect upon it As the sea retires from the spring the water acquires a greater degree of heat These springs for there are several in  the same neighbourhood are heated by a volcano in the island at the end of a secondary range of hills a proof that such burnings are not confined to the highest mountains The volcano is on the lowest hill in the range of a conical form with a crater in the middle A column of heavy smoke rises from time to time accompanied with a deep rumbling noise like thunder filling the whole air with smoaky particles and ashes and ejecting cinders to the extent of five or six miles Sometimes it emits flames and sometimes hurls to a great distance large masses of rock as big as the hulk of a ship's longboat But this volcano and its productions seem to contribute greatly to the luxuriance of the vegetation for the verdure in August the winter of these regions was astonishingly rich and beautiful The thermometer which stood at ° on board the ship rose to ° close to the volcano and being plunged into the earth for half a minute reached to ° On the sides of the mountains are several fissures in the earth from whence issue steam and smoke that keep pace with the volcano  Productions  THE productions of this island are breadfruit plantains cocoanuts a fruit like a nectarine yams so large as to weigh half a hundred weight a sort of potatoes sugarcane wild figs a fruit resembling an orange nutmegs nuts c and a variety of East Indian plants never observed in the more easterly islands  Animals  THE only quadrupeds here seen are hogs and rats the last of which being injurious to the sugarcane are caught by digging holes four or five feet deep among the canes into which they fall Their birds are the common cock and hen owls pigeons of different sorts wild doves ducks rails flycatchers creepers bats paroquets beautifully black red and yellow and a variety of small birds of fine plumage such as are unknown to the naturalist Their fish are turtle sharks dolphins garfish pikes mullet mackerell c and an amphibious fish about two inches long resembling a lizard the fins to the breast answer the purpose of feet and their eyes are placed in the summit of the head that they may see their enemies when out of water They can  leap the length of a yard with great ease They have no idea of catching fish with hooks or nets but kill them with a kind of harpoon or fishgig or shoot them with arrows as they rise to the surface of the water Their insects are musquetoes crickets c  Persons  THE islanders are of the middle size rather slender than otherwise but much stronger and better made than the Mallicolese but have none of that beautiful form which the natives of OTaheitee are so remarkable for Their features are large the nose broad but the eyes full and agreeable Most of them have good features and open countenances and a manly goodnatured air Their hair is black but sometimes brown or yellowish at the tips it is in general thick bushy and frizzled and preserves a degree of wooliness but like the hair of Europeans it grows grey as they advance in years The colour of their bodies is a dark brown with a blackish hue and like the negroes their skin is extremely soft to the touch  The women are no beauties but handsome enough for the men considering the use that is made of them for they are put to all the servile  labour such as carrying loads c It is no uncommon thing to see a woman carrying a large bundle or a child upon her back and another under her arm with a fellow strutting before her with nothing but a club or spear or some such thing Indeed the women are not held in any estimation among them for they are obliged to obey implicitly They are all illfavoured and of smaller stature than the men Such as have borne children have lost every female grace but girls about fourteen years of age have small agreeable features round full bosoms delicate arms and their whole form is slender Both men and women have a swelling in their upper eyelids so as not to be able to see without leaning their heads back this is supposed to be owing to their constantly huddling over a smoaky fire but it possibly may be propagated from parent to child as children five or six years old are troubled with the same complaint  Dress  THE men go quite naked except wearing a string round their bodies but not so tight as to cut their bellies like the Mallicolese like them also they tie up their privities to this string having first wound them about with leaves Boys of six years old do the same of course this covering is not made  use of so much from motives of decency as those of convenience Their manner of dressing their hair is very singular They cut it to about four inches in length and then collect as much of it together as will form a  queue  about the the size of a pigeons quill and wind it round with a narrow ribband made of bindweed leaving a small tuft at the end they do this with all the hair upon their heads so as to form many hundred  queues  which stand upright diverging every way like the quills on the back of a porcupine Some few will let their hair grow from five to eight inches in length in this case it hangs about their ears as if their heads had been dipped in water and looks like a number of small strings hanging down from the crown of their heads Those who have woolly hair do not  queue  it in this manner but tie it in a bunch on the crown with a leaf The womens hair is cropped and so is the boys till they arrive at manhood Most of them carry a stick in their hair about nine inches long with which they at times disturb the vermin that there abound This stick at meals also serves them for a fork They let their beards grow and some few twist them into a tail but chiefly they are suffered to remain in their natural form  The women are likewise naked except a shaggy petticoat made of grasses and leaves which they wear almost as low as their knees but which they encrease in length as they advance in life till it reaches their feet When they carry their children or a load upon their backs it is in a kind of matsatchel thrown over the shoulders The women surround their heads with a plantain leaf or piece of matting by way of cap and the men frequently deck their hair with a reed in which is stuck some owl or cock feathers  Both men and women wear amulets necklaces earrings and bracelets made of shells tortoiseshell c and also nose jewels made of white alabaster like the Mallicolese A number of rings linked together like a chain is sometimes worn hanging round from ear to ear as low as the breast They mix up a paint with cocoanut oil red ochre white lime and something like black lead and lay it on their faces in lines two or three inches broad covering often one half the face they also paint their breasts and shoulders with the same and by way of further ornament they raise scars in form of flowers upon their upper arms and bellies by cutting  the flesh with a shell and applying a particular plant to the wound  Food  THEIR poultry and hogs supply them at times with animal food and they occasionally catch fish and birds which are reckoned dainties but they chiefly live on vegetables which is much varied by their different modes of cooking Yams and bananas they either roast or boil they stew figleaves and they bake a kind of pudding of banana paste and eddoes with a mixture of the cocoanut and leaf but they have no vessels in which water can be boiled As to liquor they have none but water and the juice of the cocoanut  Mr Foster when there had reason to believe that the natives of this isle are cannibals for though he saw no appearance of it they took some pains to make him understand by signs how they killed a man cut him up separated his flesh from his bones and eat it when they had done but from what he could collect he apprehends that they eat human flesh through violence of resentment only and never slay for the purpose any but those whom they take in war  Language  THEY speak here two languages one peculiar to Tanna and one spoken at the island of Irronan seven or eight leagues to the east of Tanna and which is exactly the same with that spoken at the Friendly Ifles It is therefore probable that Irronan was peopled from the Friendly Isles and that by a long intercourse between Irronan and Tanna the natives of Tanna have acquired the language of Irronan In the common language of Tanna there are some words that have a near affinity to that of Mallicolo and others to the Malay but in general they are wholly unlike each other and related to no other tongue There is a strong aspiration and a guttural sound in many words at Tanna which are however very sonorous and full of vowels and therefore easily pronounced The following are proper names at Tanna  Pawyangom Oombyégan Fannòkko  and  Yogàî Areeke  implies a chief  Koùvosh  a successor to the crown  Markom  he is killed and  Erramange  it is a man  Habitations  THEIR huts need no other description than by comparing them to the roof of a thatched house in England forming a ridge at the top taken off the  walls and laid upon the ground with the ends open the height of the ridge from the ground is from eight to ten feet high and the width within about the same but the length from thirty to forty feet The roof is covered with palmleaves and the floor within with dry grass and here and there a mat composed of cocoanut leaves On hearths within they make fires and the whole inside of the roof is thus lined with smoke These hovels are within a small enclosure made with reeds or sticks about eighteen inches high one part of which is left low enough to step over  Utensils c  THEIR utensils are very few a matsatchel which they throw over their shoulders to carry their children in on their back baskets of matting to carry fruits and of wicker to carry chickens and the stick with which they scratch their heads and convey the meat into their mouths these with some wooden bowls are all the domestic conveniencies they have They make a coarse cloth of the bark of a tree and their hatchets are made of stone with a wooden handle  Amusements  THEY seem to be fond of music and to have a taste for singing their tunes are simple but harmonious and run through a considerable compass of notes and have in general a serious turn that adds a softness to them They excell in this the people of OTaheitee and those of Tongatabu The words of their songs compose a kind of verse and flow very currently from the tongue They have a musical instrument consisting of eight reeds regularly decreasing in size and forming an octave and in times of danger they sound conchs and raise an alarm by blowing with great force into their hands  Religion  WHAT their religion is it is impossible to say for though Captain Cook spent a fortnight at this island he could not collect any thing with certainty about that or any of their rites except that circumcision was practised among them In a particular part of the isle he heard every morning at day break a slow solemn song or dirge sung which lasted more than a quarter of an hour it seemed to be a religious act and gave reason to suppose that some place of worship was concealed  in a neighbouring grove and the constant endeavours of the natives to keep strangers from the place confirms the supposition But these songs might possibly be addressed to the corpse of some friend whom they had deposited within one of their huts for their roofs serve to cover the dead as well as the living  Government  THEIR government it is believed is in a very imperfect state every village or family appears to be independant and to unite only with their neighbours in times of invasion They have individuals among them to whom they give the title of  Areekee  or chief but who seem not to have sufficient authority to order any one up into a tree to gather any fruit These  Areekees  however are distinguished by wearing a broad red and white chequered belt round their bodies instead of a string The aged or the strong seem to have the greatest influence among them  Arms  THE natives in Tanna are either engaged in constant feuds among themselves or in frequent wars with their neighbours for they are continually armed  They are soon provoked and when so are governed by no other law than force and endeavour to extirpate their enemies with an uncommon degree of rage Their arms are clubs spears or darts bows and arrows and stones The clubs are of three or four sorts from three to five feet long with these they parry or ward off the darts of their enemies much in the same manner as they do at OTaheitee Some of their clubs have a lateral blade like a farrier's fleam some have great knobs upon them some have two sharp edges and others are cylindrical and they are all highly polished and kept oiled But they seem to rely most upon their darts which are pointed with three bearded edges in throwing them they make use of a piece of a plaited cord about five or six inches long with an eye at one end and a knot at the other They fix the eye on the forefinger of the right hand and the other is hitched round the dart just above the hand then taking the dart between the thumb and forefinger they cast it from the string to the distance of ten or twelve yards with such force and accuracy that they will hit a mark four inches in diameter and force it through a board two inches thick They shoot their arrows  with the same accuracy and force but being fearful of breaking their bows they never convey them more than eight or ten yards to do any execution Their arrows are made of reeds pointed with hard wood and bearded and are near four feet long Those for killing birds have three or four points and their bows are strong and elastic They learn this art of casting a dart and shooting an arrow with force and accuracy very early they will throw the missile weapon sixty or seventy yards but then they are not so sure of their mark and it is remarkable that whether they mean to throw it sixty yards or six they always give it the same velocity The stones they use are generally branches of coral rocks from eight to fourteen inches long and from an inch to an inch and a half in diameter and they cast them with a sling Every man carries a club besides some of the missile weapons  Canoes  THE form of their canoes is that of the Friendly Isles made out of one hollow piece of timber with a plank or two fixed at each side but the workmanship is much inferior They have outriggers to them all and some of them will contain twenty  persons The sails are low triangular mats the broadest side of which is uppermost and the sharp angle below and their oars are ill shaped and clumsy  Customs c  FRIENDSHIP is made in this island as in some others I have mentioned by a reciprocal exchange of names and whether it is owing to some superstitious notions or a fancied idea of cleanliness cannot be said but when any thing was presented to them by the Europeans they refused to touch it but desired it might be laid down and then they took it up in a leaf When any thing new strikes their attention they cry out  Heebou  and this whether they admire or dislike the different tones and manner of using the words marking the affection of the mind When they use this exclamation they always snap their fingers  As resolute and insulting as these people may be for their customary challenge and indeed it is the same with all nations of the South Seas is to turn their posteriors to their enemy and slap them with their hands I say as insulting and resolute as they may be they were always struck with a panic at the noise of the  great guns when any of them were fired from the ship for when the balls whistled over their heads and that at a very considerable distance from the vessel they began to think they could not be safe even at the farthest part of the island This not only kept them civil but made them honest for till they were dispersed by the cannon they made a variety of attempts to steal the ship's buoy  Character c  TANNA thus well supplied by nature and happy in the mild influence of a tropical climate contains a race of men much inferior in point of civilization to the natives of the Society and Friendly Isles who live nearly in the same parallel but more to the eastward As the plantations bear but a small proportion to the forests we cannot suppose the island to contain above twenty thousand people The richness of the soil rather retards the cultivation than encourages it as a very wild production is propagated with such luxuriance that to root them out will be the labour of ages The people seem to live dispersed in small villages not more than about twenty houses together They are remarkably honest compared with the people of the other  South Sea Islands for exclusive of an attempt to steal the ship's buoy there was not an instance of their wishing to pilfer At OTaheitee they are already obliged to suspend their goods to the roofs of their houses to keep them out of the reach of thieves but here they are safe on every bush They are at the same time friendly hospitable and civil they soon grew familiar with their European visitors and when they found them to be harmless and to have no hostile intentions they laid aside their distrust admitted them to their shady recesses sat down with them in their domestic circles with that harmony that becomes the members of one great family and cheerfully shared with them the produce of their little plantations They are implacable only to their enemies Far from any degree of depravity but from an excess of hospitality did they point out their girls to their new acquaintance with indications not in the least equivocal but these females with an innate modesty and a natural timidity general through the women at Tanna ran from the civility their native friends designed to confer on them and seemed much shocked at their indelicacy Their knowledge seems to be much confined and their skill in geography appeared  not to extend beyond the horizon Iron was of no value to them a bit of cloth made at OTaheitee was most coveted and for a little tortoiseshell or a few shells of mother of pearl they would barter the most valuable of their property they seem however to be in an improvable state and as many iron instruments were left among them it is not doubted but they will soon find out its uses and its value  QUEEN CHARLOTTE's ISLANDS  IN general are the discovery of Captain Carteret in and consist of Egmont's Isle or New Guernsey Howe's Island or New Jersey Egecombe's Isle or New Sark Ourry's Isle or New Alderney Swallow's Island Carteret's Island Simpson's Isle Gower's Isle and some smaller ones They are situated between ° ′ and ° ′ S latitude and ° ′ and ° ′ E longitude from London  EGMONT's ISLE OR NEW GUERNSEY  AS it was called by Captain Carteret or Santa Cruz as it was before named by Mendana who first discovered it in lies in ° S latitude and ° E longitude ninety leagues N N W of Espirito Santo about  nine hundred E of Manilla and one thousand eighthundred and fifty W of Lima and is from ninety to about a hundred leagues in circuit having many harbours it is quite covered with woods to the tops of the highest hills of which there are many no place being free from trees but where the Indians have cleared them away for their plantations There is a fine open bay in the north side of the western part of this island four leagues and a half in circuit its mouth half a league formed by an isle to the westward four leagues in circumference this isle was called by Mendana  La Guerta i e  The Garden from its beauty and fertility it was called by Captain Carteret Trevanion's Isle and was observed by him to be exceedingly populous  When Mendana came near the shore in he met with a very unwelcome reception for the natives put off from the land and let fly a volley of arrows at the ship which fortunately did no mischief the soldiers on board were accordingly ordered to fire one Indian was killed many wounded and they all fled The next morning however a chief with a train of the natives ventured on board exchanged names with the Captain as a mark of friendship and  was so well pleased with his reception and entertainment that he and his people came to and fro for four days One day however the same chief attended with fifty canoes the men in which having concealed their arms came along the ship's side but a soldier taking up a musquet so displeased him that he instantly returned to his party who rowed ashore and founded an alarm and on the boat's crew going on shore the next day for water they were attacked by the Indians and war was commenced forty soldiers by order of the Captain landed upon the island on purpose to chastise them a party of the Indians flew before them and took shelter in some houses which the soldiers burnt about their ears Six islanders lost their lives in this affair and seven of the soldiers were wounded with arrows  A party of the ship's company going ashore in another part of the island was attacked by five hundred natives casting vollies of arrows darts and stones they fought very loosely jumping about while they perceived no mischief from the fire arms but when they saw two or three killed and more wounded they fled Mendana's design was to settle a colony here having carried out a number of married people for that purpose but his project was  entirely defeated for notwithstanding he stayed here two months and eight days they could neither conquer nor bring about a reconciliation with the Indians the soldiers having malevolently killed the chief that first came off to them and notwithstanding the murderers by the Captain's orders were beheaded to satisfy the Indians nothing would effect it and to add to the misfortune sickness took place among the ship's company and carried off Mendana several of his officers and many of his people  Captain Carteret's attempt to be upon good terms with the islanders in was equally fruitless for on the master and some of the men's going ashore a skirmish ensued between them and the Indians who followed them breast high into the water as they were putting off in the boat and in this attack the master and three seamen lost their lives The Indians here are well disciplined and shoot their arrows in regular platoons His attempt to land on Trevanion's Isle was to as little purpose for as soon as the natives saw the boat leave the ship they sent off several armed canoes to attack her they returned however secure from a flight of arrows sent after them having killed  one Indian and mortally wounded another by a volley of their small arms On some of the great guns being fired from the ship with grape shot they thought proper to retire leaving the wounded Indian in a canoe by himself behind This Indian was brought on board and found to be shot through the head and to have one of his arms broken but as the surgeon deemed him past recovery he was put into his canoe again and notwithstanding his condition he paddled away to shore From this unwelcome reception which both the Spaniards and the English met with no very particular account of this island and its inhabitants can be given All that can be said is as follows  Productions  THE productions as far as could be known are of the animal kind hogs fowls ringdoves turtledoves partridges geese grey and white herons swallows and other birds no insects but a kind of black lizard Of the vegetable kind plantains sugarcanes two or three kinds of breadfruit beetle two kinds of good almonds Spanish pumpkins chesnuts and nuts cocoanuts large pineapples with kernels in them and apples resembling pearmains sago sweet  basil and a variety of herbs Ginger grows here spontaneously and the ground is covered with a plant called  Chiquilite  from which they make indigo Their grounds fields and gardens are very well laid out and the soil is black fat and loose They have curious snailshells and some pearls of value  Persons and Dress  THE natives of the isle are black but not so black as negroes and their hair is woolly They are well featured and of a common stature are nimble vigorous and active and seem almost as well qualified to live in the water as upon land for they are in and out of their canoes every minute When Carteret was there they were quite naked and unadorned but Mendana describes them in as colouring their hair some white some red and some with other colours tinging their teeth red half shaving their heads staining their bodies with a black dye marking their faces and bodies with streaks binding their arms round with many turns of black rattans covering their private parts with a kind of soft cloth ornamenting their necks with necklaces of small beads of bone ebony and fishes  teeth hanging round their bodies many plates of pearl shell and occasionally wearing in their heads and noses feathers of different colours the women with handkerchiefs and cloaks  Habitations  THEIR towns consist of about twenty houses each they are built round and of plank and thatched with palmleaves every house has two stories to which they go up by hand ladders each story is enclosed breast high the part above being left open to give light and air Their houses are surrounded by a wall of loose stones open at the entrance instead of a gate and the sides and floors within are lined with fine matting There is in each town a large house probably a temple and another long house apparently belonging to the community in which are hung bundles of arrows in great quantity ready for use and also a well or two curiously made with steps to go down and covered with plank Some of their towns are surrounded with a breastwork of stone resembling a fortification and gives reason to suppose that the natives are often troubled with civil wars and close to the sea are some fishing weirs fenced with stone The island  must be very populous for the towns swarm like beehives  Food  THE sea yields them many kinds of fish which they artfully take by various methods they have a kind of net made of twine pieces of wood serve them for floats and stones for leads The different productions of the island are eaten in turn and they make a biscuit of the breadfruit which they dry by the fire or the sun A food called  Brete  known and much used in the East Indies is eaten here it is a leaf in the shape of a heart about the size of a man's hand having the smell taste and colour of a clove they chew this leaf spit out the first spittle and swallow the rest It is reckoned wholesome and a good strengthener of the stomach and gums and from the trunk of a tree they distill by wounding it a sweetscented liquor much resembling the oil of Beto  Amusements  THE only diversion observed among them was dancing A great number will get together and with a wisp of grass in their hands stroaking each other  dance round in a ring to the sound of little drums or castenets  Manufactures  BESIDES their fishingtackle already mentioned and their weapons they make ropes of oziers and cordage of rattans bags and pockets of palm and curious and large mats for sails They weave also in small looms a kind of cloth which serves the women for covering  Arms  THEIR hostile weapons are bows and arrows darts with three rows of barbs a kind of wooden sword and stones the bows are six feet five inches long and their arrows four feet four inches pointed with flint and with these missile weapons they do execution at a considerable distance One of the arrows went through the boat's washboard and wounded a man in the thigh  Canoes  THEIR canoes for daily use are small and of rude workmanship being nothing more than part of the trunk of a tree hollowed out with an outrigger but no sails some of these are double like those at OTaheitee They will carry a dozen men  though three or four will manage them with astonishing dexterity some were seen with awnings over them But the canoes with which they go to distant parts are large and beautiful these are formed with the keel somewhat flat with head and stern all of one piece The well is in the middle where they bale out the water and step the main mast They fix stages upon some that project beyond the sides of the canoe so that the hull serves only as a support These stages will hold thirty men or more with their provisions Each canoe has one sail made of matting broad and long above and narrow below They are very swift and good to work to windward  Character  THE military courage of these people seems to be the effect of habit they are bold even to rashness and have a perseverance not common among undisciplined savages  Volcano  ABOUT ten leagues to the north of Egmont's Isle is an island of stupendous height and a conical figure the top of which is shaped like a funnel it is about three or four leagues round it is steep to the  shore quite bare and in one part of it is a volcano that vomits out fire and smoke with a thundering noise it is however inhabited at one end  CARTERET's ISLE  THE other islands of which Queen Charlotte's Isles consist were only seen at a distance and named by Carteret he had reason to believe them however to be all inhabited As he passed the island that bears his name which is about six leagues long and lies in ° ′ S latitude and ° ′ E longitude he met with some of the inhabitants fishing He sent out a boat and seized one of the canoes which was large enough to carry eight or ten men was very neatly built with planks well jointed ornamented with shellwork and figures rudely painted and the seams were covered with something like black putty but of better consistence The people were armed with bows arrows and spears pointed with flint as at Egmont Isle They seemed to be the same kind of people as the natives of that island and were quite naked Carteret's Island is about two days sail from Egmont Isle  NEW CALEDONIA  IS the discovery of Captain Cook in September and excepting New Zealand is perhaps the largest island in the South Pacific Ocean extending from the latitude of ° ′ to ° ′ S and from the longitude of ° ′ to ° ′ E Its direction is nearly NW half W and SE half E and it is about eightyseven leagues long Its breadth does not any where exceed ten leagues Captain Cook coasted the north side of the island but the south side is as yet unexplored It lies about twelve degrees or two hundred and forty leagues distant from New Holland  Face of the Country c  IT is a country full of hills and vallies of various extent both for height and depth From these hills spring great numbers of little rivulets which fertilize the plains and supply the wants of the inhabitants The tops of most of the hills seem to be barren though  some few are covered with trees as are all the plains and vallies From the hills the flat lands which lie along the shore appear to great advantage the winding streams that meander through them the plantations the little straggling villages and the pleasing variety of wood so chequer the scene as to render it delightful notwithstanding this the thin stratum of poor vegetable soil that covers the plains the numberless swamps on the sea side and the dry parched earth every where ill repay the husbandman's toils The natives are indefatigable in their cultivation or the land would not satisfy their wants They drain the morasses and manure their plantations with broken shells and corals The mountains and other high spots are for the most part incapable of being cultivated consisting chiefly of rocks many of which are full of mundicks The little soil upon them is scorched with the sun and affords little but a few scattered trees and a quantity of dry grasses two or three feet high and this to a people who have no cattle is of very little use The general way of recruiting land in the South Seas is by letting it lie useless for several years and burning the weeds and grass upon it annually  Product  THE productions of this island are figs sugarcanes plantains taro or eddy root by some called yams cocoanut and breadfruit the last two scarce and many East Indian plants The taro plantations are watered by artificial streams continually supplied by the main channel at the foot of the mountains They have two ways of planting this root some in square or oblong patches sunk below the level of the ground by which means they can let as much water in upon them as is necessary others in ridges three or four feet broad and two and a half high On the top of these ridges is a narrow gutter through which is conveyed a rill of water that moistens the whole ridge Among their trees are the mangrove and the caputitree which last is large and black at the root having long narrow leaves like willows of a pale dead green colour bearing flowers and a bark perfectly white soft and loose which often conceals within it beetles ants spiders lizards and scorpions and frequently bursts off from the wood In the East Indies they caulk their ships with the bark of this tree and the natives of the Moluccas make the oil of caputi from the leaves which are extremely fragrant  and aromatic Here is also a new species of the passionflower which is the more extraordinary as no kind of this flower has been supposed to grow wild in any part of the world except America  Animals  THEY have no quadrupeds in this island of any kind but a variety of the feathered tribe large tame fowls with bright plumage ducks a sort of small crow tinged with blue a beautiful species of parrot turtledoves flycatchers a kind of hawk boobies man of war tropic birds and others unknown to Europe Turtles and fish in plenty particularly a poisonous fish something like a sunfish with a large long ugly head and which brings on an extraordinary numbness and giddiness in those who eat it They have also as mentioned before beetles ants spiders lizards scorpions c and a flattailed watersnake Captain Cook left with them an OTaheitean dog and bitch  Inhabitants  NATURE having been less bountiful to New Caledonia than to other tropical islands in the South Seas the inhabitants are not very numerous Captain  Cook computes the number to be about fifty thousand which on a sea coast of near two hundred leagues is but small They are of a dark brown colour like that of mahogany and nearly the same with the people of Tanna but they have better features more agreeable countenances and are a much stouter race some few measuring six feet four inches in height Some indeed have thick lips flat noses and full cheeks and as they besmear their faces with black pigment they look like negroes All are in general well proportioned but many of the men have swelled and ulcerated legs and arms apparently occasioned by leprosy and also a swelling of the scrotum  The stature of the women is middlesized some are tall and their whole form is very stout and rather clumsy Their features are coarse but express goodnature the forehead high and the nose broad and flat at the root and eyes small the cheekbones prominent and the cheeks plump Their hair like that of the men is black strong and frizzled and in many woolly both men and women keep it cut short so that their heads resemble those of negroes and as it must be supposed frequently to want scratching they have an excellent instrument  for this purpose a kind of comb made of sticks of hard wood from seven to ten inches long and about the thickness of knitting needles about twenty of these are fastened together at one end parallel to each other and about the tenth of an inch asunder These combs they wear constantly in their hair on one side of their heads They cut their hair with a piece of mineral sharped like a flint Some few indeed of the men wear it long and tye it up on the crown of the head others suffer only a large lock to grow on each side which they tie up in clubs  Dress  THE men go quite naked except a wrapper over their privities which they fasten up to their girdle as they do at Mallicolo or up to the neck by a string and ornament that string with small round beads of a pale green nephritic stone This wrapper is made of soft bark or leaves and though it is contrived to conceal what all nations wish to hide it has altogether a very indecent appearance and every male looks like a walking figure of the Roman gardengod They wear on their heads black cylindrical caps made of stiff coarse matting open at top very much  like a hussar's cap The chiefs ornament theirs with feathers They stretch the flaps of their ears to a great length cut out the whole cartilage or gristle as at Easter Island and hang great numbers of tortoiseshell rings in them as they do at Tanna  The dress of the women gives them a thick squat shape and consists of a petticoat resembling fringe about eight inches long just dropping below the waist it is made of filaments or small cords laid thick over one another and fastened to a long string that is wound several times round the body The outward filaments of this fringe they dye black the under ones are of a pale yellow By way of ornament they fix on one side of the petticoat a few pearl oystershells Both sexes wear tortoiseshell earrings necklaces and bracelets above the elbow The women  tattow  or puncture themselves a little in the face generally in three black strait lines from the under lip downwards to the chin and they carry their infants on their backs in a kind of satchel  Habitations  MOST of their houses are circular something like a beehive and full as close and warm very much  like those at Cocos and Horne Island the entrance is by a square hole just large enough to admit a man upon his hands and knees The side walls are about four feet and a half high but the roof is lofty and peaked at the top above which is a stick generally ornamented with carving and shells The frame of this building consists of a number of poles fixed into the ground drawn together and tied at the top and connected to each other by twigs in the manner of hurdles This is covered with matting from top to bottom and the roof thatched with straw Within a kind of large table is made upon posts for convenience the floor is spread with dry grass to sleep on and here and there mats for the principal people Some of these houses have two floors one above the other but they have no light but what comes through the entrance In most are two fireplaces and commonly a fire burning and as there is no vent for the smoke but by the door the whole hut is continually smoaky and hot  Utensils  THEY have no great variety of houshold utensils Each family has an earthen pot that will hold four or five  gallons clumsily shaped with a large belly and made of a reddish clay but perfectly covered both within and without with soot In these they bake and cook their victuals on hearths in the open air raising the pot from the fire or embers by three pointed stones fixed into the ground and rising five or six inches from it by way of trivet The pot when on the fire is not set upon its bottom but laid inclined on one side  Food  THEY subsist chiefly on roots and fish and the bark of a tree which they roast and are for ever chewing and which has a sweetish insipid taste This tree grows in the West Indies In barren seasons they have recourse to fernroots and as to drink water is their only liquor Their fish they catch with nets made of the filaments of the plantaintree twisted and with fishgigs with which they lie in wait upon the reefs in shoal water and strike the fish as they may chance to come in their way  Tools  IT is needless to mention their working tools they being made of the same materials and much in the same manner  as at the other islands The instrument with which they stir up the soil is indeed different it being a long curved and sharppointed bill like the bill of a bird fixed upon a handle They use this also occasionally as a weapon of defence Their axes likewise are somewhat different being made of a crooked piece of wood forming a great knob with a short handle not exceeding six inches in length the knob is hollowed out and a black cutting stone is wedged into the cavity They carry loads on their back upon boards slung round the shoulders  Arms  THE people of New Caledonia are well provided with weapons of offence of course they must sometimes have wars among themselves or with their neighbours These weapons are clubs spears darts and slings for casting stones Their clubs are about two feet and a half long and of different forms some like a scythe others like a mattock some have a head like a hawk and others have knobs at the end but they are all neatly made and well polished Their darts and spears are ornamented with carved work but their slings are perfectly simple being no other than a  slender round cord no thicker than packthread with a tassel at one end a loop at the other and in the middle The stones they throw are of a soft soaprock rubbed into the form of an egg These exactly fit the loop in the middle of the sling and are kept in a pocket of matting tied round the waist for the purpose They cast their darts also with a short string knotted at one end and looped at the other as they do at Tanna called by seamen a Becket and are very dextrous in throwing them Their spears are fifteen or twenty feet long blackened over and have a prominence near the middle carved so as to resemble something like a human face  Canoes  THEIR canoes are in some sort like those of the Friendly Isles but heavy and clumsy They are as it were double consisting of two hulls made out of two large trees hollowed out the gunnel raised about two inches high and closed at each end with a kind of bulk head of the same height The two hulls are secured to each other about three feet asunder by several cross spars which project about a foot over each side on these spars is laid a deck or heavy platform on which  they have a firehearth and generally a fire burning and they carry a pot to dress their victuals in The space between the two hulls is laid with plank They are navigated with one or two latteen sails composed of matting the ropes are made of the filaments of the plantaintree twisted into cords of the thickness of a finger and three or four more such cords marled together serve them for shrouds When they cannot sail they row them on by paddles or sculls and for this purpose there are holes in the boarded deck through which they put the sculls which are so long that when the blade is in the water the handle is four or five feet above the deck The person who works it stands behind it and with both his hands sculls the vessel forward The canoe is about thirty feet in length the deck or platform about twentyfour and ten in breadth  Religion and Government  CAPTAIN Cook having been at New Caledonia but eight days little can be said of their religion Nothing was observed that could be construed into a religious act nor was a single custom remarked that had the least colour of superstition When a person dies they commit  his body to the earth and bury it Their graves are enclosed with sticks about three feet high the earth is raised a little over them and generally decorated with spears darts paddles c stuck right up in the ground about them  As little can be said of their government It is supposed that the country is divided into many districts and that each district has a chief Perhaps each family forms a little kingdom of its own which is directed by its patriarch as must be the case in all infant states The women here are kept in the highest subordination not so much esteemed by the men as those at Tanna and seem to be the only persons who are employed in any laborious business  Language  THEIR language if we except the word  Areekee i e  Chief and one or two more has no affinity with any of the various languages of the South Sea islands It seems to be uncultivated and their pronunciation is indistinct Though they have but few harsh consonants they have a frequent return of gutturals and a nasal sound unknown but to the English  Character c  THESE people are strictly honest and not the least addicted to pilfering they are good swimmers and fond of singing and dancing The only musical instrument observed among them was a whistle made of a polished piece of brown wood about two inches long shaped like a bell though apparently solid with a rope fixed at the small end Two holes were made in it near the base and another near the insertion of the rope all which had some communication with each other and by blowing in the uppermost a shrill sound like whistling was formed at the other The inhabitants in general may be deemed a friendly inoffensive people they gave Captain Cook and his shipmates a very welcome and peaceable reception addressing him first in a short set speech and then inviting him ashore but they are indolent and destitute of curiosity the greater part of them did not move from their seats when the Europeans passed them for the first time they are remarkably grave speak always in a serious tone and laughter seems to be a stranger among them perhaps their plantations lying remote from each other are the means of preventing that  familiar intercourse which would gradually give life to the pleasures of society The women are kept as I said before in the greatest subjection they seem fearful of offending the men by a look or a gesture Their insensible husbands seldom deign to look upon them and continue in a kind of phlegmatic indolence whilst the women sometimes indulge that social chearfulness which is the distinguishing ornament of the sex Considering these cruel oppressions of the sex seen in a variety of countries may we not admire the wisdom of the Creator who has planted that attachment in the female breast which stands the test of every outrage and patiently ties them to their tyrants To the honour likewise of the women of New Caledonia as well as those of Tanna it must be said that they are far more chaste than those of the more Eastern Isles they would frequently divert themselves with the European seamen seemingly listen to their proposals beckon them aside among the bushes and with an air of coquetry laugh at them for their pains There was not a single instance of their ever having condescended to permit any indecent familiarity from an European during their whole stay  NEW ZEALAND  CONSISTS of two large islands divided by a streight four or five leagues broad and lying nearly north and south of each other between ° ′ and ° ′ W longitude and ° ′ and ° ′ S latitude and about two thousand miles distant from OTaheitee The northern island is called by the natives  Eaheinomauwe  and that to the south  T'avai Poenammeo  The figure and extent of these islands will appear in the chart They are much the size of each other and together are as large as the island of Great Britain having many small islands about them They were first discovered by Abel Jansen Tasman a Dutchman on the thirteenth of December He coasted the Eastern part from latitude ° to ° and entered the streight which divides the two islands but meeting with a disagreeable reception from the natives as soon as he dropped his anchor he thought proper to weigh it again without landing He called the country Staaten Land  in compliment to the States General but it is now known by the name of New Zealand He supposed the land to be a continent but Captain Cook in and traversed the whole coast and discovered it to be two islands having a number of fine bays and anchoring places  Captain Cook was six months coasting New Zealand having made the land October and not leaving it till March He paid it a second visit in October and a third in October and it was touched at by M De Marion a Frenchman in  Face of the Country  T'AVAI POENAMMOO  is in general a barren country and a ridge of mountains towering in many places above the clouds extends nearly the whole length of the island the tops of which being for ever covered with snow more rude or desolate prospect from the sea cannot be conceived for as far inland as the eye can reach nothing but the summits of rocks appear which stand so close together that instead of vallies being between them there are nothing but fissures Further to the north the mountains are more inland and the sea coast consists of  woody hills and vallies and large plains covered with trees  Eaheinomauwe  is much more fertile it is mountainous indeed but the mountains are clothed with trees and every valley is watered with a rivulet The soil in the vales is light and sandy and the productions of Europe would flourish here with luxuriance A vast quantity of pummice stone lies all along the shore which indicates that there is a volcano in this island and that there is iron is evident from the quantities of iron sand brought down to the sea coast by every rivulet There is a mountain here as high as the Peak of Teneriffe whose summit soars far above the clouds but what is more remarkable there are many arched rocks in different places truly grand and romantic one foot of whose arches stands upon the island the other in the sea and whose arches are large enough to admit a small vessel beneath them One of these arched rocks standing inland has a river running under it  Climate  THE spring begins here with the month of November the winters are milder than those in England and the summer though more equally warm is not hotter  so that was this country settled by Europeans they might soon be richly furnished not only with the necessaries but the luxuries of life  Productions  T'AVAI POENAMMOO  is but thinly inhabited and chiefly by wanderers from one part to another but  Eaheinomauwe  is in many places highly cultivated and they save their offal for manure In their plantations the ground is as well tilled and the mould as smooth as in our gardens and every root has its small hillock ranged by lines in a regular quincunx and every thing planted with the nicest care and attention for where the person that sows is to eat the produce and where there is little else to eat it is natural to expect they should excell in tillage Their plantations are of different extent from one acre to ten here they grow sweet potatoes cocoas gourds and yams They have excellent celery and a kind of cresses with abundance of farinaceous fernroot which serves them for bread Gourds are cultivated for the fruit which furnishes them with vessels for various purposes They have a sort of long pepper very much the taste of mace and near four  hundred species of plants never yet described by any botanist  But among the vegetable productions of these islands the trees claim no small consideration Here are forests of great extent crowded with trees the straightest cleanest and largest ever seen They are rather too hard and heavy for masts but if they could be lightened by tapping as it is probable they might they would make the finest masts for shipping in the world they are not unlike the pitchpine There are some with a scarlet flower well adapted to the millwright There are many other sorts of trees one like the maple yielding a whitish gum and another giving a deep yellow substance fit for dyeing They have plenty of mangrove trees and a kind of tree that grows so large and lofty that they will measure at sixteen inches above the ground full nineteen feet in girth and ninety feet strait as an arrow from the root to the first branches many of them will yield three hundred and fiftysix feet of solid timber exclusive of the branches It bears a narrow leaf like the juniper is generally found in low land and has a darkcoloured appearance The natives make their canoes of this tree There is also a cabbage  tree here the stem not thicker than a man's leg but from ten to twenty feet high They are of the same genus with the cocoanut tree the cabbage is the bud each tree producing but one and that at the crown where the leaves spring out and are enclosed in the stem cutting off the cabbage destroys the tree This vegetable is not only wholesome but exceedingly palatable Great quantities of supplejack are found in the woods and of exceeding great length  But among all the trees and shrubs of which there are many bearing beautiful flowers and highly aromatic there is not one that produces fruit but there is a plant worth them all serving the natives instead of hemp and flax Of this plant there are two species one bearing a deep red flower the other a yellow The leaves of both resemble flags but the blossoms are not so large and their clusters are more in number They make all their clothes of the leaves of this plant and also all their strings and cordage which are at once glossy elastic and so strong that nothing made of hemp can equal them From the same by another process they draw out long slender strong fibres white as snow and shining as silk of these they  make their better cloth and by slitting the leaves in proper breaths and tying them together they make their fishingnets This plant seems to grow best in boggy grounds there is every reason to believe that it would thrive well in England and could we transport it here it would be a great acquisition  Captain Cook when there ordered some land to be dug up in which he sowed a variety of European seeds and on his return they ear following he found almost all the radishes and turneps shot into seed the cabbages and carrots very fine and abundance of onions and parsley in good order a proof that the winter was mild but the peas and beans were almost lost seemingly destroyed by the rats and no potatoes could be found probably extirpated by the natives  Animals  THERE are no four footed animals in this country but dogs and rats the latter are scarce but there are plenty of the former they are tame and live with the inhabitants who breed them merely for food Their dogs are of a sulky disposition are small and ugly with rough long hair pricked ears much like the shepherd's cur their colours are different some  are spotted some black and others white They feed as their masters do on fish and vegetables Three or four of Captain Cook's people saw a quadruped when they where out upon the hunt but as no two of them gave the same description of it it is impossible to say what it was probably as no other of the same kind was seen either before or after they might have mistaken something else for it However they all agreed that it was about the size of a cat with short legs and a mouse colour One said it had a bushy tail and was most like a jackall of any animal he knew Captain Cook left them some hogs and geese  Though quadrupeds are scarce there are birds in endless variety exquisitely beautiful and such as are unknown to Europeans hawks owls quails something like our parrots woodpidgeons and numberless small singing birds infinitely superior in wild melody to any yet heard and what is most remarkable the birds like our nightingales begin to sing at midnight and continue their song till sunrise and are silent all the day Their parrots are of two sorts one small and green the other very large of a greyish green with a reddish breast Among the small birds they have three very singular ones one with two wattles under its beak as  large as those of a small dunghill cock it is larger than an English blackbird with a short and thick bill its feathers are of a dark lead colour and its wattles of a dull yellow or orange The second is of a fine mazarine blue except its neck which is a beautiful silver grey and a few white feathers on the pinion joint of the wing Under its throat hang two little tufts of curled snowwhite feathers It has a sweet note and its flesh is delicious The third may be called a fantail of which there are several sorts but the most remarkable has a body scarcely bigger than a large filbert yet it spreads a tail of beautiful feathers three quarters of a semicircle of near five inches deep  Of the aquatic order they have ducks waterhens shags curlieus geese and gannets resembling ours and a variety of seabirds albatrosses sheerwaters pintados penguins c and a species between bird and fish whose feathers differ little from scales and whose wings serve only for diving  Of ducks there are five different kinds the largest are the size of Muscovy ducks beautifully feathered and darkly variegated with a large white spot on each wing The second sort are about the size of an English duck its  feathers are brown tipped with a yellowish white with bright green feathers in its wings and bright yellow eyes The third sort is a bluishgrey whistling duck about the size of a widgeon with a cartilaginous or gristly bill for they live upon worms which they suck out of the mud The fourth sort is something larger than a teal and all black except the drake which has some white feathers in his wings The last sort is rather less than a teal its colours are a shining greenish black above a dark sooty grey below a purple cast on the head a lead coloured bill and feet a white bar in the lesser quill feathers and a golden eye  A few butterflies beetles and fleshflies like ours with some musquitos and sandflies make up their whole list of insects and with the last two they abound The sting of the sandfly is exceedingly painful and when the part stung grows warm causes an intolerable itching which if scratched brings on a violent swelling attended with great pain and some fever  Of fish they have no scarcity every creek swarms with them mackerel of many kinds bream mullet skate stingray flounders eels congers lobsters crayfish clams cockles muscles and fine oysters and they have some  whales and plenty of seals They catch their fish with cylindrical nets which they bait and lower down into the water drawing them up gently and when at the surface taking them out with a jerk  Inhabitants  THE number of inhabitants bears no proportion to the extent of country  Tavai Poenammoo  is as I said before very thinly peopled consisting chiefly of wanderers but  Eahienomauwe  is better populated though the western side of this island is quite a desert and the interior parts being so mountainous scarce any place is inhabited but the sea coasts which on an extent of four hundred leagues is supposed to contain only about one hundred thousand people  Persons  THE stature of the men in general is equal to the largest European tall but lean yet exceedingly strong fleshy and well made and they are exceedingly active and vigorous with an uncommon adroitness in every thing they do but most of their legs are slender and bandy with large knees owing to the little exercise they take and their continually sitting crosslegged in confined canoes  Their complexion is a clear mahogany brown though they are rather darker in the southern island Their hair is black and curling and their teeth extremely regular and white They have good faces like Europeans dark eyes lips rather thick and aquiline noses Their voice is rough they talk loud and in general are more rude and unpolished than the natives of OTaheitee  The women are plain and have no great female delicacy but their voices are remarkably soft and harmonious and by this they are chiefly distinguished the dress of both sexes being nearly the same They have like the women of other countries a cheerfulness superior to the men and a greater flow of animal spirits Some of them have uncommon long breasts They seem to be proud of their sex and expect to have every thing they wish from strangers merely because they are women  They  tattow  themselves here as they do at OTaheitee and call it  amoco  different tribes have different ways of marking themselves some cover themselves so much on the breech and thighs with spiral lines that they seem as if they had on black striped breeches and as they add something every new year to the ornaments of  the last those who are advanced in life are almost covered from head to foot They have scarcely a stain except on the lips which all seem to concur in rendering black Many indent their skins so as to resemble carving which they do by cutting it with shells The women are  tattowed  only on the breasts necks and bellies but then they besmear their faces and bodies with red oker and oil which seldom dries and thus render themselves filthy and nasty for whoever touches them partakes of their colouring Servants among the men do the same but these use chiefly dry oker and some carry it with them and as constantly renew the colour as it rubs or wears off  Dress  THE general dress of the men of this country is merely a wrapper round the body kept from falling below the waist by two slips over the shoulders fastened before and behind with bone bodkins It is made of flagleaves and resembles a shaggy doormat Some men on particular occasions wear another piece of this matting round the waist which reaches almost to the ground They tie the prepuce of the penis with a string over the glands and fasten this string to a girdle  round the body The glands indeed seem to be the only part they wish to conceal for they will often throw off every thing without scruple but this string and girdle which whenever they were requested to untie they did with reluctance and confusion Some wear shoulderknots made of the skin of the neck of a large seafowl with the feathers on slit into two pieces lengthways and some wear a piece of shaggy matting round their shoulders by way of cloak which has all the appearance of a straw thatch The dress of the chiefs and principal people consists of a cloth jacket ornamented with stripes of dogskin in different parts or tufts of red feathers and cloaks trimmed with dogsfur of different colours and often lined with the same This cloak is a square piece two corners of which are tied on the breast the other part hangs down to the calf of the leg and a belt of matted grass confines it round the waist  The women wear a petticoat and cloak of the same rough matting perfume them with some fragrant plant and beneath the petticoat before wear a bunch of aromatic leaves hanging from a girdle between the legs They wear their hair cropped short or flowing about their shoulders ornamenting it with leaves but the men tie  theirs up in a bunch on the crown of the head decorate that bunch with feathers and stick a comb behind it Their beards they wear cut short Both men and women grease their hair and frequently wear upon the crown of their heads a large bunch of black feathers tied up round so as to raise their head twice its natural height and almost to cover it  Both sexes wear a variety of ornaments earrings necklaces and anclets Both men and women bore their ears and stretch the holes till they will admit a finger in these they wear cloth feathers bones of large birds and sometimes pieces of wood stuck through them The women frequently stuff in the white down of the albatross stained with ruddle or oker which spreads before and behind as large as one's fist and though singular has a very good effect Sometimes they hang to their ears by strings chizels or bodkins made of talc and often the nails or teeth of their deceased relations bracelets and anclets are made of birds bones shells or any other substance they can drill a hole through The men sometimes wear round the neck suspended by a string a piece of green transparent tale or whalebone shaped like a laurel leaf and with the rude figure of a man carved upon it  and sometimes through the septum or gristle that divides the nostrils a long feather projecting on each side over the cheeks and some wear a fillet of feathers round their heads  Food  THE chief food on which this people live is fish and vegetables Dogs flesh is very scarce The birds they eat are generally penguins albatrosses and a few others which serve them as delicates They roast their birds by hanging them to a small stick inclined to the fire one end of which is stuck into the ground and bake them by putting them into a hole in the ground with hot stones as they do at OTaheitee They frequently dry their fish in order to preserve them and smoke their eels As a substitute for bread they eat fernroots very similar to ours which they thus prepare after scorching them over the fire they beat them with a stick till the bark and dry outside fall off what remains is a soft substance rather clammy and sweet mixed with stringy fibrous parts which after having chewed they spit out They are great eaters will take in pieces six times as large as we can do and will drink near a quart at one draught  Water is their only liquor and having nothing that will intoxicate they are in this respect the happiest persons in the world but on the other hand should their plantations fail or an unfavourable season happen and they accidently not be provided with a sufficient dry stock the distress to such as inhabit the interior parts of the country must be dreadful This will in some measure account for the fear these people live in of each other for the care they take to fortify their villages and for the horrid custom of eating those whom they kill in battle The head is the only part they do not eat They suck the brains and frequently convert the skull to domestic purposes such as to hold water c The way they dispatch their prisoners is by knocking them down with their pattapattoos and then ripping them up  Habitations  THE towns or  hippahs  of these people are all fortified Many are built upon eminences near the sea and secured on the land side by a bank and ditch and a high paling within the ditch and some have outworks Their houses are built on a rising ground under a tuft of trees but are little better than dogkennels seldom more  than eighteen or twenty feet long eight or ten broad and five or six high and consist only of a roof the pole that runs from one end to the other forms the ridge to the ground The framing consists of slender sticks tightly put together and is covered with dry grass There is a door at one end just high enough to admit a person on his hands and knees near the door is a square hole for the double purpose of giving light and letting out the smoke The roof projects beyond the end walls about two feet so as to form a porch in which there are benches for the family to sit on That part of the floor where the fireplace is which is generally at the end in the middle between the two sides is inclosed in a hollow square by partitions either of wood or stone and in the midst the fire is made The floor within along the sides is bedded thick with straw and on this the family in bad weather sleep at other times they sleep abroad in the open air having no other shelter but a few shrubs the women and children are ranged innermost the men lie in a half circle round them and they set up their arms against the trees close by them  Furniture c  THEIR furniture and utensils are very few One chest commonly contains the whole except the baskets that hold their provisions the gourds that serve them as water cups and the hammers with which they bruise their fernroot  Amusements c  THEIR chief amusements are singing and dancing Whilst one sings in a rough manner others will dance and make their gestures conform to the roughness or uncouthness of the song they will roll their eyes loll out their tongues alternately extend their arms work themselves up into a kind of frenzy and joining with the last chorus of the song stamp their feet in a violent and frantic manner Greyheaded old men will often take part in their dances and assume every antic posture imaginable Women when they dance tie on before them an apron made of their closewrought cloth ornamented with red feathers dogskin and earshells but they throw off as do the men their shaggy cloaks They sing sometimes particularly the women with a degree of taste uncommon among savages their voices are mellow and soft and have a pleasing and tender effect  Their songs are frequently in parts sung by many voices and in proportionate thirds Their tunes are generally dirgelike slow and solemn resembling the chaunt which a popish priest uses at mass containing many tones and semitones and they accompany their songs which seem to have great simplicity and to be a kind of metre without rhyme with some corresponding expressions of countenance Their music is far superior to that of the Society and Friendly Isles and if any nation of the South Sea comes in competition with them it is only that of Tanna  They have three sounding instruments but they can scarcely be called musical ones One is a trumpet made of a shell which gives a noise not unlike that which our boys make with a cow's horn This shell is generally mounted with wood prettily carved and pierced at the point where the mouth is applied The second is a straight wooden tube about four feet long five inches in diameter through its whole length except at the mouth where it is reduced to two with this instrument they always sound the same note and it makes a very uncouth kind of braying The third is a small wooden pipe resembling a child's ninepin but much smaller and yields a noise something like a peawhistle  They are sensible that these instruments are not musical for they never attempt to sing to them or to produce with them any tones that bear the least resemblance to a tune  The only toy observed among the children was a top shaped like those in England and which was spun by whipping it  Manufactures  TWO or three sorts of cloth are made in these islands the shaggy sort mentioned before resembling a thrummed doormat one as coarse as our coarsest canvas though ten times as strong and another as glossy as silk The shaggy sort is made of flagleaves split into three or four slips and interwoven when dry leaving a number of ends hanging to it on the outside eight or nine inches long and the glossy sort is formed by many threads lying very close one way and a few crossing them the other but these are about half an inch asunder somewhat like the round pieces of cane matting that are by some persons placed under the dishes upon table to save the cloth This stuff is prepared so as to shine like silk and is often striped It is made in a frame of the size of the cloth about five feet long and four broad across which the long  threads that lie close together or warp are strained and the cross threads or woof are worked in by hand To this last kind of cloth they work borders of different colours and various patterns in stitches like an girl's sampler and with a degree of neatness and elegance which considering they have no such thing as a needle is surprizing this is always the work of the women though it is chiefly worn by the men They have the clothplant here as well at OTaheitee and they make cloth of it but being scarce no larger pieces are made than sufficient to hang in their ears by way of ornament  They have a particular and singular taste for carving they attempt not to imitate any thing in nature but confine themselves to a volute or spiral which they vary many ways single double and triple and with as much regularity as if done from mathematical draughts They thus ornament their boats paddles arms tools and almost every thing they make though they have very awkward tools to do it with  Their fishing nets must not be here forgotten These they make of a kind of grass very strong in it's nature and their principal nets are so large that they seem to be the joint work  and joint property of a whole town they are generally about five fathom deep and from three to four hundred fathom long they make also a circular net extended by two or three hoops seven or eight feet in diameter which they bait at the bottom and leave open at the top In using it it is let down so as to lie on the ground and when a sufficient quantity of fish is supposed to be collected over it they draw it up by a gentle and even motion so that the fish are scarce sensible of being lifted up in it till they bring it very near the surface of the water and then take it out by a sudden jerk They very seldom angle for fish but when they do their fishhooks are made of bone  Nothing else worth mentioning on this head was seen among them but baskets of various kinds and dimensions very neatly made of wickerwork for carrying and holding their provisions c  Tools  THEIR tools are not many but answer the purposes for which they are designed They have adzes axes and chissels The chissel serves equally for an auger they having no contrivance to bore holes Having no metal their axes and adzes are made  of a hard black stone and their chizzels of human bone or pieces of jasper chipped from a block like gunflints They have a variety of small tools of jasper for finishing their neat work which when grown blunt are thrown away having no method of sharpening them  Considering the instrument with which they till their land it is astonishing to think how much work can be done in a little time This instrument which serves them both for plough and spade is nothing more than a long narrow stake cut to an edge at one end about three inches broad with a short piece fixed transversely at a little distance above it for the convenience of the foot to press it down With this they will turn up pieces of seven or eight acres and with great expedition the soil being light and sandy  Tillage weaving and the other arts of peace seem to be practised in the northern parts of this country but the arts of war flourish through the whole  Arms c  THEIR declarations of hostilities are always accompanied with a warsong and dance in which the women  often join during this exultation they stamp their feet violently hideously writhe their bodies roll their eyes thrust out their tongues fetch loud and deep sighs and distort their faces in the most horrid manner and when they begin the attack it is by shouting and brandishing their weapons  Upon a wish of Captain Cook's to see their method of attack and defence one young man mounted a fighting stage which is a platform raised from the ground and surrounded with a ditch of which they have many large ones on the sides of hills and another went into the ditch both he that was to defend the place and he that was to attack it sung the warsong and danced in the frightful manner I have described working themselves up into a degree of mechanical rage this done they attacked each other with uncommon fury They first pierce with a lance and then proceed to knock their enemy on the head with a short club  The perpetual hostilities in which these people live owing to there being so little land in a state of cultivation have made every village a fort and they seem to have studied more the instruments of war than those of peace Had they any kind of order or military discipline  among them they would be much more formidable in arms than they are for no quarter is given to the enemy  They have no missile weapon but the lance which is fourteen or fifteen feet long pointed at both ends and barbed and sometimes headed with bone these are grasped by the middle and thrown by the hand They make use of darts or shorter lances at times and also of stones but have no contrivance like the bow to convey their darts nor any such thing as a sling Their other weapons are battleaxes a staff about five feet long broad at one end like an oar and pointed at the other and the  patoopatoo  which is generally made of green talc well polished about a foot long and thick enough to weigh four or five pounds it is made like a pointed battledore with a short handle and sharp edges well contrived for close fighting as it would split the thickest scull at a single blow Through the handle of this weapon is a string which is twisted round the hand when used The principal people consider this instrument as a military ornament and constantly wear it sticking in their girdles Their engagements whether in boats or on shore are generally hand to hand the slaughter of  course must be dreadful as a second blow from their weapons is unnecessary if the first takes place  The chiefs carry about them a staff of distinction generally the rib of a whale white as snow ornamented round the top with carving dogskin and feathers like our sheriffs halberts but sometimes this staff is merely a stick about six feet long adorned in the same manner and inlaid with a shell resembling mother of pearl  Canoes  THE ingenuity of these people appears in nothing more than their canoes they are of different sizes narrow and long and resemble very much the New England whaleboat Some of the larger sort seem to be built chiefly for war and will contain from forty to near a hundred armed men being near seventy feet long though not more than five feet broad and about three feet and a half in depth The sides are made strait of three entire planks one above another which reach from end to end and are sewed together by a string made of the flaxplant and caulked with the woolly substance of the reedmace The sides being strait and the bottom sharp they are in form of a wedge A considerable  number of thwarts or seats are laid from gunwale to gunwale in order to strengthen them and a profusion of carved ornaments decorate the head and stern which project beyond the body rising almost perpendicularly five or six feet above it are pierced through and through in spirals like fillagreework and are adorned with streamers hanging from them The gunwales of their best boats are also carved in a grotesque taste and ornamented with tufts of white feathers placed upon a black ground  These boats are worked on by eighteen or twenty small light paddles about six feet long neatly made having an oval blade pointed at the bottom and gradually losing its oval form in the handle and the Indians have such an adroitness and manual dexterity in using these paddles that thirty of them together will keep time so exactly that one would think the rowers were actuated by one common soul Sails of matting fixed upright between two poles are sometimes made use of but they can make no way with these except right before the wind They frequently sing when rowing and beat time with their paddles  Language  THE language of New Zealand and OTaheitee is radically the same the difference being merely provincial or a different dialect but guttural That of the northern part and southern parts of New Zealand differ only in the pronunciation  The following list will shew the affinity  ENGLISH  NEW ZEALAND  OTAHEITEE  A  Chief  Eareete  Earee  A  Man  Taata  Taata  A  Woman  Whahine  Ivahine  The  Ear  Terringa  Terrea  The  Mouth  Hangoutou  Outou  The  Belly  Ateraboo  Oboo  and numbers of the words and terms in both islands are exactly the same a convincing proof that New Zealand must originally have been peopled from OTaheitee though at near two thousand miles distance nay they have a tradition among them that corroborates the assertion for they say that their ancestors in a very remote period came from another country  Religion c  LITTLE can be said of their religion except that they worship a supreme Being believe in subordinate deities and give nearly the same account of the origin of the world c as they do at OTaheitee  They make offerings of provisions occasionally to the inferior gods but what other homage they pay could not be learned as no place of worship was seen in the island nor any religious ceremonies They seem to pay a degree of veneration to a species of creeper which they call  atuee  or the bird of the divinity but they never expressed the least wish to preserve the life of this bird in preference to any other  What they do with their dead I cannot take upon me to say in the northern parts they told their European visitors that they buried them in the ground and in the southern parts that they threw them into the sea with a stone fastened to them to sink them No such a thing as a grave was seen in the island nor any monument except in one place where a cross was erected ornamented with feathers This was designed to perpetuate the memory of some  friend or relation but the particulars could not be learned as they make a mystery of these matters  The only ceremony observed at the death of a kinsman was that of scarifying the body of the survivors Women at the decease of their husbands and men at that of their nearest relations cut their arms thighs and faces with sharp shells in a very dreadful manner and it is a considerable time before the wounds are healed  Government  THE inhabitants of the southern isle  T'avai Poenammoo  live a wandering life and seem to be under no regular kind of government the head of each tribe indeed is respected and on some occasions commands obedience but those of  Eahienomauwe  acknowledge a sovereign under whom are several subordinate chiefs to whom great respect is paid and by whom justice is is probably administered and it was learned that they possessed their authority by inheritance  Customs  THE small societies in the southern island have several things in common particularly their fine clothes and fishingnets Their fine clothes are preserved in a place by themselves in the middle of their towns and part of their nets are found in almost every house for when they go out to fish they collect these parts and join them together  The women here seem to be held in less estimation than in the other South Sea islands they carrying at New Zealand all the burdens and doing all the drudgery Dr Forster was an eye witness of the ferocity of the natives with respect to the women A boy about six or seven years old demanded a piece of boiled penguin which his mother held in her hands but she not immediately complying he took up a large stone and threw it at her Incensed at this the woman ran to punish him but she had scarce given him a blow before her husband fell upon her beat her in an unmerciful manner dashed her against the ground and was very near killing her Ill treatment of the weaker sex is carried here to excess and contrary to every principle of morality boys are taught from their  infancy to hold their mothers in contempt It is the employment of the men to till the ground catch birds make nets and go out to fish and that of the women to dig up fern roots collect lobsters and other shellfish near the beach cook and weave their cloth nay the women it is supposed sometimes go out to war for many were seen carrying spears  These people have but few customs among them but what are common to the other South Sea islands addressing a stranger in a formal speech or oration while they present a green branch or a white bird's skin and then putting on their own coat upon him is a signal and ceremonial of amity waving the hand and crying out  Horomai  is a token of friendship and putting noses together is their mode of salutation They never take a present till they have given one and when they are pleased upon any occasion they cry  ai  and cluck like a hen  Character  THE disposition of this people seems to be mild and gentle they treat each other with great attention and affection but are implacable towards their enemies to whom they give no quarter It may at first appear strange that where conquest  is attended with little advantage there should be frequent wars but if we consider that selfpreservation is the first law of nature that the principal food of the islanders is fish and that this is only to be caught upon the sea coasts and in sufficient quantities at certain times only and of course that the inland tribes without a constant lookout to preserve this food must be in frequent danger of perishing by famine I say when this is considered we may readily account not only for their fortifying their little towns but for the horrid custom of eating their prisoners of war for when a man is pressed by hunger to take up arms every natural feeling is lost and every sentiment that would otherwise restrain him from allaying it with the body of his adversary is absorbed If this account of the origin of feeding on human flesh be admitted as plausible the reason of its continuance will readily be seen for when the practice has been begun by hunger it will naturally be kept alive by revenge for among those who are accustomed to eat the dead death must have lost much of its horror and where it has lost much of its horror there will not be a great repugnance to kill especially when a  desire to destroy is whetted by an implacable revenge  Though the New Zealanders are more irrascible than the other South Sea islanders in general they are however less immodest having some idea of indecency They are as decent and reserved in their actions as the politest persons in Europe The women are not impregnable indeed but their terms and manner of compliance do them honour When an overture is made to any young woman the party is given to understand that the consent of friends is necessary that a suitable present must be made that the consenting female must be treated with good manners and delicacy that no unbecoming liberties must be taken and that the daylight must not be a witness of what passes between them An agreement thus made is considered by them as innocent as a marriage ceremonial in England many of the women are however as great coquets as the most fashionable ladies in Europe and the young ones are exceedingly skittish  The young unmarried women would not have been very liberal of their favours to the European seamen had it not been often by the compulsion of their fathers and brothers  who bartered their virtue for iron tools The idea of female chastity in New Zealand is very different from ours for a girl may favour a number of lovers without any stigma upon her character but if she marries conjugal fidelity is exacted from her with the utmost rigour  But if the New Zealanders are more modest than the natives of OTaheitee they are less cleanly for the climate being colder they do not so often bathe This however might be dispensed with if they did not render themselves filthy by the oil with which they grease their hair the better kind of people use it fresh but the lower class anoint their heads with rancid oil which makes them smell like a Hottentot and add to this notwithstanding they have combs both of bone and wood most of them are intolerably lousy nay the vermin that infest their heads may be often seen crawling upon their cloaths and so lost are they to cleanliness that they will occasionally crack them between their teeth and eat them  The chief of diseases taking their rise from intemperance and want of exercise both of which are unknown to these islanders it is no matter of wonder that they enjoy perfect and uninterrupted health Among hundreds of every  age not an eruption nor any mark of one was seen upon their skin nor any bodily complaint Their wounds heal naturally of themselves without any topical application and among a great number of very old men they were all observed to be chearful and none of them decrepid  While they considered the Europeans as their enemies and as coming to make an advantage of them they did not scruple to plunder them as opportunity served and to descend to little acts of unfairness and dishonesty they would receive the price of what they offered to sale and when done pack up the purchase and purchase money with great composure and march off with it as lawful plunder but when they began to be acquainted with their visitors they wished to establish a mutual confidence and never presumed to pilfer any thing  As the reader may probably wish to know the reception the first Europeans met with who touched at New Zealand the following will gratify him  When Captain Tasman touched at  Eahienomauwe  in they would not suffer him nor any of his people to go ashore but attacked the ship's boat and murdered three of his men  This led him to call the bay where he anchored  Murderers Bay  But as they have no tradition of any European vessel paying them a visit before that of Captain Cook in October his may be considered as the first As soon as he cast anchor he accompanied with a party put off for the shore and landed in sight of a number of people assembled on the beach leaving four boys with the cockswain to take care of the boat As soon as they landed the people ran away but when he had got to some distance from the sea side four armed men rushed forward to seize the boat which was prevented by the boys putting off from the shore and the cockswain's firing a musquet and killing one of those who attacked him When this man fell the other three stood motionless for some time almost petrified with astonishment presently after recovering their surprize they dragged the dead body away with them and left Captain Cook and his party an opportunity to return But the next day taking with him a native of the Society Isles whom he brought with him and who was understood by the New Zealanders the nature of his visit was explained and a friendly intercourse took place between them but not till three or four were  killed by musquetballs for attempting to plunder the ship Three boys being taken by force on board the vessel they had no other expectation than to be instantly put to death but when they found themselves treated with generosity and kindness their joy was beyond expression They continued on board till the next day and being sent on shore dressed and decorated with bracelets and necklaces they represented to the natives the kind treatment they had received from the Europeans and thus established a peace between them They met also with some opposition in landing at other parts of the island and a native or two fell in the dispute but matters were soon settled and an amicable intercourse succeeded for those who are strangers to firearms must naturally dread the very thought of them It was so here and when the islanders found themselves not safe from a discharge of the cannon even at great distances they gave up all attempts at opposition  I must not omit to mention however a dreadful affair that happened to Captain Furneaux's people when in Charlotte Sound in December A midshipman with nine of the boat's crew being sent on shore to gather greens were  taken and put to death and eaten by the savages It was afterwards learnt that on one of the natives stealing a seaman's jacket the midshipman gave orders to fire at them Thus war commenced between them and when they had fired away all their ammunition they fell a sacrifice to the resentment of their enemies  Monsieur Dufresne Marion who had the command of two ships from France and who put into a bay in distress at the northern island of New Zealand in was with twentyeight of his men murdered by the natives Having lost his masts he was obliged to search the woods of this country for new ones and though he had lived upon the best terms with the islanders for thirtythree days he with his men were surprized and cut off But notwithstanding these two transactions the New Zealanders must be acquitted of either treachery or cruel malevolence for it is greatly to be suspected that some umbrage was taken at something done by the strangers and that the affair was revenged with that passionate fury which hurries on a savage to excess  As there is something very uncommon in part of this business I will close the account of New Zealand with the relation The carpenters were  encamped in the woods under the protection of a M Crozet with a small party for the purpose of making new masts c Upon the news therefore of Captain Marion and his men being cut off a corporal and four marines were dispatched to M Crozet to acquaint him with his danger while several boats waited to receive him M Crozet immediately disposed every thing as well as he could to effect a retreat but soon found himself in sight of a prodigious crowd of the natives led on by several chiefs He directed the four marines to be ready to fire at such persons as he should point out if necessity required it and then ordered all his party to strike their tents and retire with their tools to the boats while he advanced up to one of the chiefs This man told him that M Marion was killed by another chief whom he named At this M Crozet stuck a stake into the ground just before the feet of the chief and bid him advance no farther The boldness of the action startled the savage which being observed by M Crozet he insisted on his commanding the croud to sit down which was accordingly complied with He now walked up and down before the natives till all his men were in the boat his soldiers were ordered to follow and  himself was the last who embarked Scarce was the boat put off from the shore but the savages began their song of defiance and threw stones at him however by the exertion of his people he got safe on board This however did not intimidate M Crozet for finding himself under a necessity of procuring new masts he landed again with a party attacked one of their fortifications and cut a breach in it an armed chief instantly stepped into it and was shot dead another stepped on the dead body and occupied his place he likewise fell a victim to M Crozet's heroism and in like manner fell eight chiefs who successively defended and bravely fell upon this post of honour The rest seeing their leaders dead fled and many were pursued and killed In short after this enterprize M Crozet completed the repairs of his ship without interruption and prosecuted his voyage after a stay of sixtyfour days  SALOMON ISLANDS  NOW known by the name of Nova Britannia consist of New Britain New Ireland New Hanover and a number of smaller islands They lie in the neighbourhood of New Guinea in about ° W longitude and ° S latitude about two thousand five hundred leagues W from America were first discovered by Mendana in and by him called Salomon and afterwards New Britain by Dampier in  As these islands were merely coasted little can be said of the country or the inhabitants New Ireland is ninetyfive leagues long twenty broad and above two hundred in circuit and the face of that island as well as New Britain and their neighbouring isles is mountainous beautifully romantic picturesque and well cloathed with trees of enormous growth The heat of the climate may be known by Farenheit's thermometer which stood at ° and ° through the whole month of July New Ireland  and New Hanover received their names from Captain Carteret who touched there in  These islands are supposed to be very populous from the many thousands that appeared on the sea coast and are fertile in provisions and cattle The inhabitants are black and woolly headed like negroes but have not the thick lip and flat nose They go naked except covering their privities with a piece of mat and wearing bracelets and anclets of shells their ears are generally long and they bore them to carry earings their teeth are red from chewing  betel  and they powder their hair and beards abundantly with a white powder They occasionally wear plumes upon their heads large round white plates of shells hanging to their necks and rings through the cartilages of their noses and if we may judge of the people by their miserable dwellings they must stand low even in the scale of savage life Their food is cocoanuts and roots though they occasionally eat human flesh they adore snakes toads and such things are a people who live in small communities have frequent wars among themselves and make slaves of their prisoners  The tide at New Ireland ebbs and flows once in four and twenty hours and rises at the spring between eight and nine feet  The soil of these islands is light and their productions are cocoanuts in plenty betel the areca the fine Indian reed mangleapples various species of the palm aloe canes bamboos rattans with many trees shrubs and plants unknown to Europeans There are also the nutmeg and pepper tree but no esculent vegetable of any kind The thatch palm was also seen there and the cabbage tree the fruit of which is a white crisp juicy substance somewhat like a chesnut when eaten raw and when boiled superior to the best parship Among the trees is one bearing a plumb with a pleasant tartish taste not unlike a Jamaica plumb  Of the animal kind there are dogs wild boars and tigercats turtles serpents snakes scorpions centipedes and a number of insects of a singular sort One of these is three or four inches long covered over with a kind of armour with six legs projecting points on the sides and a very long tail another about three inches long belonging to the Mantis genus almost every part of its body is of such a texture that it appears like a leaf even when we are closely  examining it each of its wings is one half of a leaf which when closed together seem one entire leaf the under side of its body wears the appearance also of a leaf but of a more dead colour than the upper one the creature has two antennae and six legs the upper joints of which are also similar to parts of leaves  Of birds there are great variety European poultry large pigeons of great beauty their plumage greengold their neck and belly of a greyish white with a little crest upon their heads Another large crested pigeon near as big as a turkey of azure plumage called a Crowned Bird in the Moluccas which has a plaintive note like the cries of men and another kind whose cry resembles so well the barking of a dog that every one who hears it for the first time must be deceived by it There are likewise turtledoves and widow birds larger than those of the Brasils  Fish also abound upon the coasts in large quantities which the natives take with nets They are not without some rock oysters and very large cockles so large as to spread five feet between point and point of the shell  Their canoes are very long and very narrow with an outrigger some of them reach to  ninety feet in length and yet are formed of a single tree The head and stern are very much raised to shelter the people within from arrows which is done by turning either end of the boat towards the enemy Their canoes are decorated with carved work and paddled on by thirty or forty rowers  The offensive weapons of these people are lances bows and arrows slings and long sticks and poles like the quarterstaff They have also shields to defend themselves These offensive and defensive weapons their dextrous management of them and their boldness in attacking is a convincing proof that they are almost constantly at war  These islands being not a great way from New Holland the customs and manners of the natives must be in many respects similar I shall proceed therefore to treat of the latter being that of which we are best informed for though M De Bouganville anchored at New Britain in he was not long enough there to be much acquainted with the people  NEW HOLLAND  IS an island of larger extent than any other in the known world The eastern coast of it first discovered by Captain Cook in and called by him New South Wales takes up twentyseven degrees of latitude being near two thousand miles long so that its square surface must be much more than equal to all Europe The northern western and southern coasts were discovered by the Spaniards early in the seventeenth century but the eastern coast had not been seen by any before Captain Cook The northeast part is but five leagues from New Guinea and the southeast part known by the name of Van Dieman's Land discovered by Abel Tasman in not above eighteen days sail from the southern island of New Zealand  Face of the Country  SOUTH of ° or ° the land in general is low and level more to the northward  it is hilly but not mountainous It is rather barren than otherwise but still the rising grounds are diversified with wood and lawn and the plains covered with herbage in many places The trees are tall strait and without underwood and standing at such distances that the land between them will admit of cultivation never less than forty feet asunder The soil of the hills is hard dry and strong yet productive of trees and coarse grass high but thin that of the plains and vallies is in some places sandy in some clayey and in others rocky yet wears the appearance of fertility  Productions  OF timbertrees there are but two sorts the largest is the gum tree which grows all over the island it yields a deep red gum and the wood is heavy hard and dark coloured like the  lignum vitae  with narrow leaves like those of the willow The other grows tall and upright resembling the pine something like the live oak of America The wood also of this tree is hard and heavy Besides these there are trees having a soft bark easily peeled off the same that is used for caulking of ships in the East Indies  There are palms also of three different sorts one whose leaves are plaited like a fan the cabbages of which are small but exceedingly sweet another like the West India cabbage tree with large pinnated leaves like the cocoanut producing large fruit and a third about ten feet high with smaller pinnated leaves bearing no cabbage but abundance of nuts about the size of chesnuts They have among other trees one that bears a fruit in colour and size not unlike a cherry whose juice indeed has no great flavour but an agreeable tartness The borders or banks of the bays of which there are many are covered with mangroves and the island abounds with a number of small trees and flowering shrubs unknown to Europeans There is one tree which produces a sort of fig but very poor another that bears a plumb flat on the sides like a dried medlar and a third that bears a kind of purple apple in taste something like a damascene  There are also a great variety of plants unknown to us but very few of the esculent kind except a sort of bean growing on a stalk that creeps along the ground a kind of parsley and porcelain two species of yams one shaped like a parsnip the other round and a plant  called Coccos the leaves of which are little inferior to spinnage I must not forget to mention here that the ground is almost every where covered with a grass whose seeds in the month of May are very troublesome to the walker they are sharp and bearded backwards so that when they stick in one's cloaths which they do at every step they are worked forwards by means of the beard till they reach the flesh and prick it  Animals  OF quadrupeds there are several that we are unacquainted with but as they could not be caught no description can be given of them They seem to be of the wolf polecat and weazel kind There are goats but no tame animals except dogs They have the opossum a creature with a membranous bag near the stomach in which it conceals and carries its young when apprehensive of danger They have also a remarkable animal about the size of a sheep called a Kanguroo some of which will weigh upwards of eighty pounds and are not bad eating resembling the flesh of a hare but better flavoured Its body is formed like a goose largest behind and growing taper to the head which resembles that  of a fawn it has lips and ears which it throws back like a hare's on the upper jaw it has six large teeth on the under one only two its neck is short and small near to which are the fore feet which have five toes each with nails like a cat The fore legs are kept close to the breast and seem like those of a mole to be used only for digging they are small and not more than eight inches long having no knee joint but the hind legs have the customary joints of animals and are twentytwo inches in length It has a tail tapering to the end as long as its whole body which it carries like a greyhound and the whole animal is covered with a short fur of a dark mouse or grey colour It sets up on its hinder legs like a hare in her form and does not run like other quadrupeds but leaps like a hare or deer  Of birds there are great variety of exquisite beauty Loriquets fine large black cockatoos with scarlet and orangecoloured feathers in their tails and some white spots on each wing and also between the beak and ear These fly in flocks of scores together They have also the goatsucker or churnowl the beeeaters large bats a small bird with wattles of a deep orange red another with wattles of a fine ultramarine  colour with black beak and legs an owl having the iris of its eyes gold colour and the pupil of them dark blue a large black and white gull with a bright yellow beak on the gibbous part of which is a scarlet spot the corners of its mouth and irides of its eyes a bright scarlet and its legs and feet a greenish yellow a black bird with a bright red beak yellow at the point the iris of its eyes scarlet and the feet and legs a pale yellow and many other curious small birds unknown to Europeans They have likewise quails and crows resembling ours a species of bustard beautiful grey pigeons with red beaks and reddish brown crests two sorts of doves two sorts of paroquets pied hawks black and white kites and eagles  Of the aquatic kind herons whistling ducks that perch and roost on trees wild geese curlieus a bird like a pelican larger than a swan and other sorts of waterfowl  Of the tribe of insects they have green caterpillars in great numbers which range themselves on the mangrove leaves side by side twenty or thirty together and whose hair on their bodies sting like a nettle butterflies in such quantities that for the space of three or  four acres the air is often so crowded with them that millions may be seen flying in every direction while every branch and twig in the neighbourhood is covered ants also of different kinds some white and others black the black ants will perforate the twigs of the gumtree work out the pith and occupy the pipe that contained it yet the parts in which these insects form a lodgment and in which they swarm in amazing numbers bear leaves and flowers and appear to flourish as much as those that are sound Upon the branches of these trees the ants will often make nests of clay as big as a bushel There are ants as green as a leaf that live upon trees where they build their nests of various sizes from that of a man's fist to the size of his head These nests are curiously formed by bending down several of the leaves which are as broad as one's hand and gluing the points of them together so as to form a purse the glue used upon this occasion is an animal viscus which nature has provided them with Thousands will unite their strength to bend down a leaf which they do by their weight while others employ the gluten to prevent its return If disturbed they will throw themselves  upon their enemy and sting him like a bee  Of fish they have sting rays rock and pearl oysters in such quantities that a pearl fishery might be there established to great advantage muscles and other shell fish cockles some of which are as much as two men can move and contain twenty pounds of good meat crabs of two kinds one adorned with the finest hue equal to the ultramarine with which all its claws and every joint is deeply tinged and the under part white and so exquisitely polished that in colour and brightness it resembles the white of old china the other kind is marked more sparingly with the ultramarine but its back is beautifully spotted with brown They have also plenty of turtles and watersnakes like land ones except that their tails are broad and flat which serve them for fins but among all the fish seen at the island none is more remarkable than one that jumps it is about the size of a minnow and has two very strong breast fins by which it leaps as nimbly as a frog it seems not to prefer water more than land for it will frequently leave the water and pursue its way on dry ground  Of other reptiles they have alligators serpents venomous and harmless and lizards  Inhabitants  IN proportion to the extent of land the number of inhabitants appears to be small for though Captain Cook was upwards of three months upon the coast and it is natural to have expected numbers should have flocked to the seaside in order to view what must seem to them a wooden world yet he never saw so many as thirty collected together nor when they formed a resolution to oppose the Captain's landing could they muster more than fourteen or fifteen fighting men neither do they appear to live in societies but like other animals to be scattered about along the coast and in the woods Nor indeed was a spot of ground seen in a state of cultivation in any part of the island a further proof of the thinness of the inhabitants for where the sea does not contribute to feed the inhabitants the country must be desolate  The complexion of these people is what is commonly called a Chocolate Colour though they are so uniformly covered with dirt that it is difficult to say what their true colour is Their features are far from disagreeable their noses  not being flat nor their lips thick their teeth are white and even and their hair though they singe it short is naturally long and black and generally straight with a slight curl at bottom They some way or other keep their hair free from lice though they seldom comb it for it is in general matted and greasy but without oil or grease  The beards of the men are of the same colour with their hair and also bushy and thick it never being suffered to grow long Their stature is of the middle size but slender and their bones so small that a common hand may span their ancles and their arms above their elbows and in general they are cleanlimbed and remarkably vigorous active and nimble Their countenances are not without expression and their voices are remarkably soft and effeminate  Both sexes go quite naked without the least sense of indecency but still they are not without their ornaments the principal of which is a bone five or six inches long and as thick as a man's finger which they thrust through the septum of their noses it reaches quite across the face and so effectually stops up the nostrils that the wearer when he speaks snuffles so as scarce to be understood and is obliged to keep  his mouth constantly open in order to breathe freely The sailors in humour called it their Spritsailyard They wear also necklaces made of shells bracelets of small cord round the upper part of their arms and a string of human hair plaited tied round the waist and some were seen with large gorgets of shells hanging on the breast and a few women with feathers in their heads stuck on with gum They paint themselves red and white and dust their faces with a white powder The red is generally laid on in broad patches upon the breast and shoulders and the white in streaks one round their thighs two below their knees one like a sash over their shoulders and another across their foreheads They have holes also in their ears but no ornaments were seen in them On their bodies were noticed large scars in irregular lines apparently made by some blunt instrument probably as memorials of grief for the dead  Habitations  LIKE quadrupeds they seem as was said before not to live in societies but to wander about in the woods and a farther reason to confirm this assertion is that in an extent of near two thousand miles upon  the coast nothing like a town or village was to be seen Their huts are merely sheds to sleep in scarce big enough for a man to sit under and hardly large enough to cover his whole length They are made with sticks about an inch diameter in the form of an oven open at one end by sticking the two ends in the ground and covering them with pieces of bark or palm leaves They frequently make fires in these houses and as they seldom wash or clean themselves they thus become smokedried Under these sheds they sleep with their heads and knees together so that in this position one hut will hold three or four persons  The only furniture they have is an oblong vessel made of bark contrived by tying up the two ends with a withy to carry water and a small bag knit like a cabbagenet which the men carry on their backs by a string round their heads for the purpose of conveying from place to place the little treasure they possess generally only a lump or two of paint a piece of resin some lines and fishing hooks the bracelets c which they continually wear and a few points of darts  Food  EXCEPT the fruits and vegetables of the country they eat little but fish now and then indeed they kill the Kanguroo and occasionally a bird or turtle Though they have no vessel to boil water in they do not seem to eat animal food raw they broil it and bake it with hot stones in an oven in the same manner they do at OTaheitee They were constantly observed chewing a leaf but of what quality it was could not be learned all that can be said is that it had no visible effect upon the teeth or lips  Having no nets they catch fish only by striking it with a fishgig or by hooks and lines except such as they find in the hollows of the rocks and shoals when the water ebbs Their hooks are very neatly made and some of them are exceedingly small Their lines are from half an inch to the fineness of a hair and are made of some vegetable substance  Birds they catch when at roost and animals they kill with their lances when they pass by a tree in the branches of which they conceal themselves for the purpose  Their method of procuring fire and spreading it is worth remarking To produce it they take two pieces of soft dry wood one a round  stick of about eight or nine inches long the other piece flat one end of the round piece they shape into an obtuse point and make a hole in the flat piece In this hole they twirl the end of the stick between their hands as we do a chocolate mill pressing it down in the hole till it fires By this method they get fire in less than two minutes and from the smallest spark they increase it with astonishing speed They will wrap up a spark in a little dry grass which by moving will be fanned into a flame Thus a man will run on for miles and without any visible fire in his hands will at every fifty or a hundred yards stoop down and leave fire behind him  One of their methods of annoying their European visitors whom they considered as enemies was by setting fire to the high grass in the neighbourhood of the place where the tents were fixed which being dry as stubble burnt with amazing force and did incredible mischief  Arms  THEIR weapons are spears and lances of different kinds some with four prongs pointed with bone and barbed the points of which are covered with a hard resin which gives them a polish and facilitates their entrance into what they strike others  have only one point with the shaft made of a light jointed cane from eight to fourteen feet long others are barbed all the way up the shaft They are very dextrous in throwing them and will convey them forcibly with the hand ten or twenty yards but if they wish to convey them further they make use of a throwingstick which is a plain smooth piece of hard wood highly polished about two inches broad half an inch thick and three feet long with a small knob or nook at one end and a cross piece about three or four inches long at the other In the shaft of the lance near the point is made a hollow to receive the knob of the throwingstick from which it easily slips on being impelled forward To throw it they lay the lance along upon this instrument and hold it over the shoulder and after shaking throw both the stick and lance with all their force but the stick being stopped by the cross piece which comes against the the shoulder with a jerk the lance flies forward with incredible swiftness and with such good aim that the thrower is more sure of his mark at fifty yards distance than a musqueteer is of his ball They have also bows and arrows and an oblong shield three feet long and eighteen inches broad made of bark and a wooden  sword resembling a scymitar Some of their weapons had a chizzel fixed at their ends but of what substance they were framed could not be learned  Canoes  THE canoes of New Holland are as wretched as their houses To the southward they are made of one piece of bark about twelve feet long tied up at the ends and spread open in the middle by two sticks In shallow water they push them on by a pole and in deep water by paddles two of which they use at a time More to the northward they are made of the trunk of a tree fourteen feet long hollowed out by fire They are in general very narrow and furnished with an outrigger to prevent their oversetting They never carry more than four people  Tools  The only tools seen among them were an adze made of stone wedges of the same wooden mallets and a few shells and pieces of coral For polishing they make use of the rough leaves of a wild fig which answers the purpose of shavegrass With such wretched tools it is astonishing that they can perform any kind of work but there are few difficulties  that perseverance will not overcome and that will not give way to the patience and good contrivance of a workman  Language  SOME idea of their language may be collected from the following list of words They articulate plainly though in speaking they make a great motion with their lips When they mean to shew a disapprobation they utter their words vociferously and when they would manifest an approbation they cry  hee  with a loud flexion of voice in a high and shrill tone They say  tut tut  many times together to express astonishment and often whistle when surprized  The  Head  Wageegee  Hair  Morye  Eyes  Meül  Eyebrows  Garbar  Nose  Bonjoo  Breast  Coyor  Hands  Mangal  A  Dog  Cotta  A  Turtle  Putai  A  Butterfly  Walboolbool  A  Canoe  Carbanda

no idea of traffick nor could any be given them for all the signs made to them describing a return for things presented to them were fruitless they did not seem to understand them This indifference with respect to buying kept them honest they never attempted to purloin any thing but if refused what they wished for they attempted to take it by force They seemed to set no value upon any thing that was given them for like playthings given to children they pleased only while they were new Nor do they seem to have any curiosity for though walking on the sea shore in sight of the ship a wonderful machine they had never seen before  of numbers that trudged along scarce one cast an eye towards it  They introduce strangers into company by their names as they do in England  Whether they are brave or not cannot truly be ascertained they made some little opposition on the crew's landing but they were soon intimidated by the fire arms as a few pieces fired with small shot presently dispersed them and after the first contest they would never come near enough to parley so that the Europeans could by no means form the least connection with them How it happens that there are so few inhabitants is not easy to devise whether they are destroyed by each other in contests for food whether swept off by famine or their increase prevented by any particular cause cannot be at present determined That they have wars amongst them is evident by their weapons but what gives rise to these wars or what is the consequence of them cannot be ascertained the few facts that could be picked up we here give our reader and he must be left to reason for himself  CAMCHATCA OR KAMSCHATKA  IS that great peninsula which makes the boundary of Asia to the north east and stretches from north to south about ° ′ The beginning of this peninsula is at the rivers Pustaia and Anapho lying in ° ′ N latitude At these places the isthmus is so narrow that in fair weather the sea may be seen on both sides from the hills in the middle The figure of the peninsula is somewhat eliptical being broader towards the middle and growing narrower towards both ends The country north of the isthmus is called Zenosse and is under the government of Anadir  Camchatca was long known to the geographers of former times but it never could be  delineated till the last two expeditions of the Russians to that part of the world  The southern part of the peninsula is called Lopatha and lies in ° ′ N latitude the difference of longitude from Petersburgh is found to be at Ochotskoy ° ′ E  Face of the Country  CAMCHATCA is plentifully furnished with rivers but so small that none except one is navigable This will carry vessels two hundred versts upwards from its mouth  Productions  UPON the banks of the navigable river is found plenty of roots and berries which in some measure supply the want of corn Near the head of this river both summer and winter corn would grow as well as in other places of the same latitude the soil being deep and rich for though the snow falls in very great quantities yet it thaws early enough and the spring is not so wet nor have they such damps there as in many other places Several trials of summercorn have been made in which both barley and oats have succeeded but it cannot be expected that they should sow any great quantities as for  want of horses they are obliged to plough their land with men  As to vegetables the most succulent plants produce only leaves and stalks cabbage and lettuce never come to perfection and peas continue in blossom till late in the harvest without yielding so much as a pod but succulent roots such as turneps and radishes thrive very well The grass runs up near six feet high especially near the rivers and lakes and grows so fast that it is sometimes mowed three times in a summer The cattle therefore are large and fat and give plenty of milk all the year for the grass continues full of juice even to the beginning of winter and this juice being condensed by the cold prevents the grass from turning hard during that season so that there is feed all the winter Places where the grass thus grows are never so much covered with snow as the bogs and swamps and on this account it is difficult to pass over them in winter There is plenty of wood in this country not only for building houses but even for shipbuilding  Inhabitants  THE natives of Camchatca are as wild as the country itself Some of them have no fixed habitations but wander from place to place with their herds of rein deer others have settled dwellings and reside upon the banks of the rivers and the sea shores  They are divided into three nations the Camchatcans the Koreki and Kuriles The Camchatcans live upon the south side of the peninsula the Koreki inhabit the northern parts and round the eastern ocean almost to Anadir and the Kuriles inhabit the islands in the eastern sea reaching as far as those of Japan  They are of small stature swarthy have black hair broad faces sharp noses with the eyes falling in eyebrows small and thin hanging bellies and slender legs and arms They are notorious cowards great boasters and are remarkable for their slavishness to people who use them hardly and for their obstinacy and contempt of those who treat them with gentleness  Dress  THEIR cloaths are chiefly made of skins of deer dogs several sea and land animals and even the skins of birds those of different animals being frequently joined in the same garment Their upper garment is made after two fashions sometimes cutting the skirts all of an equal length and sometimes leaving them long behind in form of a train with wide sleeves long enough to reach down below the knee and a hood or caul behind which in bad weather they put over their heads below their caps the opening above is merely large enough to let their heads pass and round this opening they sew the skins of dogs feet with which they cover their faces in cold stormy weather Round their skirts and sleeves they put a border of white dog's skin and upon their backs they sew the small shreds of skins of different colours They commonly wear two coats the under coat with the hair side inwards the other side being dyed with alder and the upper with the hair outwards For the upper garment they choose black white or speckled skins the hair of which is most esteemed for the beauty of its colours  Men and women without distinction wear the abovementioned garments their dress only differing in their under cloathing and in the covering of their feet and legs The women have an under garment which they commonly wear at home consisting of a breeches and waistcoat sewed together The breeches are wide like those of the Dutch skippers and tie below the knee the waistcoat is wide above and drawn round with a string Their summer habits are made of dressed skins without hair their winter ones of deer or stone ram skins with the hair on The undress or household habit of the men is a girdle of leather with a bag before and a leather apron to cover them behind these girdles are sewed with hair of different colours They used frequently to go a hunting and fishing during the summer in this dress but the fashion being now changed they wear linen shirts which they buy of the Russians  The covering of their feet and legs is made of skins of different sorts In the summer time during the rains they wear the skins of seals with the hair outwards but the most common covering is the skin of the legs of the rein deer and sometimes of the legs of other beasts the  shaggiest they can find to preserve them against the cold But the buskins which both the Cossacs and Camchatcans use in their finest dress are made in the following manner The sole is a white sealskin the upper part of fine white leather and the hind quarters of white dogskin what comes round the legs is of dressed leather or dyed sealskin the upper parts are embroidered These buskins are looked upon so extraordinary that if a batchelor wears them he is immediately concluded to be dressed for courting  They wear the same sort of caps as the people of Jakutski In summer they tie about their heads a kind of hat made of birch bark and the Kuriles in hot weather wear caps of platted grass but at present round the Russ settlements the fashion is changed the women wearing shifts ruffles waistcoats caps and ribbands The women do all their work in mittins Formerly they never washed their faces but now they use both red and white paint Rotten wood serves them for white paint and a seaplant for red which they boil in seal's fat and rub their cheeks with till they are very red They dress most in winter especially when they either receive or pay visits  The common cloaths for a Camchatcan and his family will not cost him less than a hundred rubles so dear is every article of dress The Kuriles are better able to buy good cloaths than the Camchatcans for they can purchase for one seabeaver as much as the Camchatcans can for twenty foxes and one beaver costs the Kuriles no more trouble in catching him than five foxes do the Camchatcans for he must be a good hunter who takes more than ten foxes in the winter and a Kurili thinks himself unlucky if he does not catch three beavers in the season besides the numbers that are cast on shore by storms  Food  THE Camchatcans divide their fish into six parts the sides and tail are hung up to dry the back and thinner part of the belly are prepared apart and generally dried over the fire the head is laid to sour in pits and is then eaten like salt fish and is much esteemed though it stinks intolerably the ribs and flesh upon them are hung up and dried and then pounded for use the larger bones are dried and given to the dogs  Their second favorite food is  caviar  or the roes of fish which they prepare three different  ways They dry the roe whole in the air or take it out of the skin which envelopes it and spreading it upon a bed of grass dry it before the fire or make rolls of it with the leaves of grass which they also dry They never take a journey or go a hunting without dry caviar and if a Camchatcan has a pound of this he can subsist without any other provision a great while for every birch and alder tree furnishes him with bark which with his dried caviar makes him an agreeable meal but they cannot eat either separately for the caviar sticks to the teeth like glue and it is almost impossible to swallow the bark by itself chew it ever so long There is still a fourth method which both the Camchatcans and Koreki use in preparing their caviar the first having covered the bottom of a pit with grass throw the fresh roes into it and leave them till they are sour the Koreki tie theirs in bags and leave them to sour this is esteemed their most delicate dish  There is a third sort of diet called by the Chamchatcans  Chupriki  which is thus prepared In their huts over the fireplace they make a bridge of stakes on which they lay a heap of fish which remains there till the hut becomes as warm as a bagnio If there is no great thickness  of fish one fire serves to dress it but sometimes they are obliged to make two three or more fires Fish dressed in this manner is half roasted and half smoaked but has a very agreeable taste and may be reckoned the best of all the Camchatcan cookery for the whole juice and fat is prepared with a gradual heat and kept in by the skin from which they may when done enough be easily separated and as soon as it is thus dressed they take out the guts and spread the body upon a mat to dry this they afterwards break small and putting into bags carry it with them for provision  They have another dish much esteemed which they call  Huigul  it is fish laid to grow sour in pits and though the smell of it is intolerable yet the Camchatcans esteem it a perfume This fish sometimes rots so much in the pits that it cannot be taken out but with ladles in this case indeed they give it to their dogs  As for the flesh of land and the larger seaanimals they boil it in their troughs with several different herbs and roots the broth they drink out of ladles and bowls and the meat they take out upon boards and eat in their hands  There is a principal dish at all their feasts called  Selaga  made by pounding all sorts of roots and berries together with the addition of caviar and whale's and seal's fat  Before the conquest by the Russians they seldom drank any thing but plain water except when they made merry at which time they drank water which had stood some time upon mushrooms Now they drink spirits as fast as the Russians After dinner they drink water and at night set a vessel of water by the bedside with the addition of snow or ice to keep it cool and always drink it up before morning In the winter time they amuse themselves frequently by throwing handfuls of snow into their mouths and the bridegrooms who work with the fathers of their future brides find it their hardest task to provide snow for the family in summer time for they must bring it from the highest hills be the weather what it will or they never would be forgiven  Habitations  UNDER the name of  Ostrog  is understood every habitation consisting of one or more huts all surrounded by an earthen wall or palisadoe  Their huts are built in the following manner They dig a hole in the earth about five feet deep the breadth and length proportioned to the number of people designed to live in it In the middle of this hole they set up four thick wooden pillars over these they lay balks upon which they form the roof or cieling leaving in the middle a square opening which serves them for a window and chimney this done they cover the building with grass and earth so that it resembles a round hillock without but within it is an oblong square with the fireplace in one of the long sides between the pillars round the walls of their huts they make benches upon which each of the family lies separately but on that side opposite the fire there are no benches being left for their kitchen furniture In these huts where there are no benches there are balks laid upon the floor and covered with mats They adorn the walls within with grass mats  These huts are entered by ladders commonly placed near the firehearth so that when they are heating their huts the steps of the ladder become so hot and the smoke so thick that it is almost impossible for a stranger to go up or down without being burnt or stifled to death  yet the natives find no difficulty in it and though they can only fix their toes on the steps of the ladder they mount like squirrels nor do the women hesitate to go through this smoke with the children upon their shoulders though there is another opening through which the women are allowed to pass but if any  man  should pretend to do the same he would be laughed at The Camchatcans live in these huts all the winter after which they go into others which they call  Balagans  These serve them not only to live in during the summer but also for magazines The balagans are built in the following manner Nine pillars about two sathom long or more are fixed in the ground and bound together with balks laid over them which they cover with rods and over all lay grass fastening spars and a round sharp roof at top which they cover with bramble and thatch with grass They fasten the lower ends or the spars to the balks with ropes and thongs and have a door on each side one directly opposite to the other They make use of the same kind of huts to keep their fish c till winter comes on when they can more easily remove it and this without any guard only taking away the ladders If these buildings were  not so high the wild beasts would undoubtedly plunder them for notwithstanding all their precaution the bears sometimes climb up and force their way into their magazines especially in harvest time when fish and berries begin to grow scarce  The southern Camchatcans commonly build their villages in thick woods and other places which are naturally strong not less than twenty versts from the sea and their summer habitations are near the mouths of the rivers but those who live upon the Penchinska sea and the eastern ocean build their villages very near the shore They look upon that river near which their village is situated as the inheritance of their tribe  Furniture Utensils c  BEFORE the arrival of the Russians the Camchatcans used stones and bones instead of metals out of which they made their hatchets spears arrows needles and lances Hatchets were made of the bones of whales and rein deer and sometimes of agate and flint they were shaped like a wedge and fastened to crooked handles With these they hollowed out their canoes bowls dishes and troughs which  with cans of birchbark constituted the whole of their furniture but with so much expence of trouble and time that a canoe would be three years in making and a large bowl one year On this account a large canoe or trough was in as great estimation among them as a vessel of the most precious metal and finest workmanship is with us and the village in possession of such a canoe or trough valued itself extremely upon it In these bowls they dress their victuals and heat their broth by throwing redhot stones into it  Their knives were made of a greenish mountain crystal sharp pointed and shaped like a lancet which was stuck into a wooden handle Of such crystals were likewise made their arrows spears and lancets with which they still continue to let blood Needles they formed of the bones of sables with which they not only sewed their cloaths together but made also very curious embroidery  To procure fire they use a board of dry wood with round holes in its sides and a small round stick this they rub in a hole till it takes fire making use of dry grass beaten soft by way of tinder These instruments are held in such esteem by the Camchatcans that they are  never without them and they value them more than our steels and flints they are however exceedingly fond of other iron instruments such as hatchets knives or needles nay at the first arrival of the Russians a piece of broken iron was looked upon as a great present and even now they receive it with thankfulness finding use for the least fragment either to point their arrows or make darts which they do by hammering it out cold between two stones As some of them delight in war the Russian merchants are forbidden to sell them any warlike instruments but they are ingenious enough to make spears and arrows out of the iron pots and kettles which they buy and they are so dextrous when the eye of a needle breaks as to make a new one which they will repeat until nothing remains but the point  Boats  THE Camchatcans make their boats of poplar wood but the Kuriles not having any wood of their own make use of what is thrown on shore by the sea and is supposed to come from the coasts of Japan China or America The northern inhabitants of Camchatca the settled Koreki and Chukorskoi for want of proper timber and plank  make their boats of the skins of sea animals They sew the pieces together with whales beards and caulk them with moss or nettles beaten small  These boats hold two persons one of which sits in the prow and the other in the stern They push them against the stream with poles which is attended with great trouble when the current is strong they can scarely advance two feet in ten minutes notwithstanding which they will carry these boats full loaded twenty versts and when the stream is not very strong even thirty or forty versts  The larger boats carry thirty or forty pood When the goods are not very heavy they lay them upon a float or bridge resting upon two boats joined together They use this method of conveying their provisions down the stream and also to and from the islands  Employments c  IN summer time the men are employed in catching drying and carrying fish to their houses in preparing bones and sour fish to feed their dogs the women in cleaning the fish and spreading it out to dry sometimes they go a fishing with their husbands When fishing season is over  they gather in the herbs roots and berries both for food and medicine  In harvest men catch the fish that appear at that time and kill fowl such as geese ducks swans and the like teach their dogs to draw carriages and prepare wood for their sledges and other uses The women at this time are busy in pulling up nettles of which they make their thread watering breaking and peeling them and laying the hemp of them up in their balagans  In winter the men hunt for sables and foxes weave fishingnets make sledges fetch wood and bring home the provisions which they had prepared in the summer and could not bring home in harvest The women at this time are principally employed in spreading threads for nets  In spring when the rivers begin to thaw and the fish which there wintered go towards the sea the men are busied in catching them and the amphibious animals that at this time frequent the bays The people on the eastern shore catch the seabeaver All the women go into the fields where they gather wild garlick and other young herbs which they use not only in a scarcity of other provision which often happens  at this season of the year but likewise out of luxury for so fond are they of every thing that is green that during the whole spring they are seldom without having some of it in their mouths and though they always bring home a great bundle of greens it seldom lasts them above a day  Besides the abovementioned employments the men are obliged to build their huts and balagans to heat their huts dress victuals feed their dogs flay the animals whose skins are used in cloathing and provide all household and warlike instruments The women are the only taylors and shoemakers for they dress the skins make the cloaths shoes and stockings it is even a disgrace for the men to do any thing of that sort so that they looked upon the Russians who came here first in a very ridiculous light when they saw them use the needle or the awl The women are likewise employed in dying skins in conjuration and curing the sick  Their method of preparing and dying skins sewing and joining them is as follows Skins which they use for cloaths such as those of the deer seal dog and beaver they prepare in the following manner First they wet and spread  them out scrape of all the pieces of fat or veins that remain after flaying with stones fixed in pieces of wood then rubbing it over with fresh or sour caviar they roll it up and tread it with their feet till the hide begins to stink they again scrape and clean it and continue this till the skin is soft and clean Such skins as they want to prepare without the hair they use at first in the same manner as above then hang them in the smoke for a week and afterwards soak them in warm water to take the hair off at last rubbing them with caviar by frequent treading and scraping them with stones they make them clean and soft  They dye the deer and dog skins which they use for cloathing with alder bark cut and rubbed very small Seal skins they dye in a more curious manner Having first cleaned off the hair they make a bag of the skins and turning the hair side outwards they pour into it a strong decoction of alder bark after it has lain thus some time they hang it upon a tree and beat it with a stick This operation they repeat till the colour is gone quite through the skin then they rip it open and stretching it out dry it in the air at last they rub it till it becomes soft and fit for use Such skins are not unlike  dressed goat skins They call them  Mendari  and are worth about three shillings each The hair of the seals with which they ornament their cloaths and shoes is dyed with the juice of the red wortleberry boiled with alder bark allum and lac lunae which makes a very bright colour They used to sew their cloaths and shoes with needles made of bone and instead of thread they made use of the fibres of the deer split to the size or thinness required  They make glue of the dried skins of fishes and particularly of the whaleskin A piece of this they wrap up in birch bark and lay it for a little while in warm ashes when it becomes fit for use  Method of Travelling c  THE dogs of Camchatca differ very little from our common housedogs they are of a middling size and of various colours though there seem to be more white black and grey than of any other In travelling they make use of those that are castrated and generally yoke four to a sledge  They drive and direct their dogs with a crooked stick about four feet long which they sometimes  adorn with differentcoloured thongs this is looked upon as a great piece of finery They drive their sledges sitting on the right side with their feet hanging down for it would be considered as a disgrace to a man to sit down in the bottom of the sledge or to have a person to drive him no one doing this but the women  It is very difficult to travel in these sledges for unless a man keeps the exactest balance he is liable every moment from their height and narrowness to be overturned in a rugged road this would be very dangerous as the dogs never stop till they come to some house or are entangled by something on the road especially in going down steep hills when they run with all their force and are scarcely to be kept in for which reason in descending any great declivity they unyoke all the dogs except one and lead them gently down They likewise walk up hill for it is as much as the dogs can do to draw up the empty sledges After a deep snow before it has been hardened by a frost there is no travelling with dogs until a road be made which is done by a man's going before with snowshoes whom they call  Brodovshika  These snowshoes are made of two thin boards separated in the middle bound together at the ends and with the forepart bent a little upwards The  Brodovshika  having one upon each foot leaves the dogs and sledge and going on clears the road for some way then returning leads forward the dogs and sledge so far as the road is made a method which he must continue till he comes to some dwellinghouse This is very laborious and it happens so often that no driver ever sets out without his snowshoes  When a storm of drivensnow surprizes them they are obliged with all haste to seek the shelter of some wood and stay there as long as the tempest lasts which sometimes is a whole week If they are a large company they dig a place for themselves under the snow and cover the entry with wood or brambles Sometimes they hide themselves in caves or holes in the earth wrapping themselves up in their furs and when thus covered they move and turn themselves with the greatest caution least they should throw off the snow for under that they lie as warm as in their common huts they only require a breathing place but their cloaths must not be  tight or hard girt about them for then the cold is unsufferable  Another danger attending travellers is that in the severest frost several rivers are not quite frozen over and as the roads for the most part lie close upon the rivers the banks being very steep scarce a year passes without many being drowned A disagreeable circumstance also to those who travel in these parts is their sometimes being obliged to pass through coppices where they run the risk of having their eyes scratched out or their limbs broken for the dogs always run most violently in the worst roads and to free themselves very often overturn their driver  The best travelling is in the month of March or April when the snow is become hard or frozen a little at top however there is still this inconvenience attending it that sometimes travellers are obliged to lodge two or three nights in desart places and it is difficult to prevail upon the Camchatcans to make a fire either for warming themselves or dressing their victuals as they and their dogs eat dried fish and find themselves so warm wrapped up in their furs that they want none nay all the people of this climate bear cold so well that they sleep  in the open air as sound as others in a warm bed and awake next morning perfectly refreshed and alert This seems to be so natural to all here that some of them have been seen to lie down with their backs uncovered against a fire and notwithstanding the fire has been burnt out long before morning they continued to sleep on very comfortably and without any inconvenience  Manner of War  THOUGH before the Russian conquest the Camchatcans did not seem to have had any ambition of encreasing their power or enlarging their territories yet they had such frequent quarrels among themselves that seldom a year passed without one village or other being entirely ruined The design of their wars was to make prisoners in order to employ them if males in their hardest labour or if females to make wives or concubines of them and sometimes the neighbouring villages went to war for quarrels that happened among the children or for neglecting to invite each other to their entertainments  Their wars are carried on more by stratagem than bravery for they are such cowards that  they will not openly attack any one unless forced by necessity this is the more extraordinary as no people seem to despise life more than they do selfmurder being here very frequent Their manner of attacking is this In the night time they steal into the enemy's village and surprize them which may easily be done as they keep no watch thus a small party may destroy a large village as they have nothing more to do than to secure the mouth of a hut and suffer no body to come out which one only can do at a time whoever therefore first attempts to escape is knocked down or obliged to submit to be bound  The male prisoners which they take especially if they are men of any consequence are treated with all manner of barbarity such as hewing them to pieces tearing out their bowels when alive and hanging them up by the feet This has been the fate of several Russian Cossacs during the disturbances of Camchatca and their barbarities are exercised with great show of triumph and rejoicing  The private differences among themselves were very useful to the Cossacs in their conquest of the nation for when the natives saw the latter attacking one village they were so  far from assisting their countrymen that they rejoiced at their destruction not considering that the same was to be their fate next  In their wars with the Cossacs they destroyed more by stratagem than by arms for when the Cossacs came to any village to demand its tribute they were received with all marks of friendship and not only the tribute was paid but likewise great presents were made them Thus the natives having lulled them into a state of security they either cut their throats in the night time or set fire to their huts and burnt them with all the Cossacs which were within By such stratagems seventy people were destroyed in two places which considering the small number of Cossacs that were there was a very considerable loss nay it has sometimes happened that when they had no opportunity of immediately destroying the Cossacs they have for two years quietly paid the tribute waiting till they could find an opportunity of doing it But now the Cossacs are more upon their guard and are particularly afraid of extraordinary caresses and always expect some bad intention when the women in the night time retire from their huts When the Camchatcans pretend to have dreamed of dead  people or go to distant villages there is reason to dread a general insurrection  When this happens they kill all the Cossacs which fall in their way and even the Camchatcans who will not join in the rebellion As soon as they hear that troops are coming against them instead of going to oppose their enemies they retire to some high place which they fortify as strongly as they can and building huts there wait till they are attacked when they bravely defend themselves with their bows and arrows and every other method they can think of but if they observe that the enemy is likely to make themselves masters of the fortress they first cut the throats of their wives and children and afterwards either throw themselves down the precipice or with their arms rush in upon their enemies that they may not die unrevenged this they call 'Making a bed for themselves' In the year the rebels threw themselves from a very high hill upon which they were fortified into the sea after murdering all their women and children except a girl whom they missed in their hurry Notwithstanding this resoluteness from the time that Camchatca was subdued there have been but  two rebellions which could properly be called so  Their arms are bows and arrows spears and a coat of mail their quivers are made of the wood of the larchtree glued round with birchbark their bowstrings of the blood vessels of the whale and their arrows are commonly about four feet long pointed with flintstones or bone and though they are but indifferent yet they are very dangerous being all poisoned so that a person wounded by them generally dies in twentyfour hours unless the poison be sucked out which is the only remedy known Their spears are likewise pointed with flint or bone Their coats of mail are made of mats or of the skins of seals or seahorses which they cut into thongs and plait together They wear them on the left side tying them with thongs upon the right behind is fixed a high board to defend their heads and another before to guard the breast  It is remarkable when they march two never go abreast but follow one another in the same path which by use becomes very deep and narrow so that it is almost impossible for one that is not used to it to walk therein for these  Camchatcans always set one foot straight before the other in walking  Trade  THEIR trade is almost entirely confined to procuring the immediate necessaries and conveniencies of life They sell the Koreki sables fox and white dog skins dried mushrooms and the like in exchange for cloaths made of deerskins and other hides Their domestic trade consists in dogs boats dishes troughs nets hemp yarn and provisions and this kind of barter is carried on under a great show of friendship for when one wants any thing that another has he goes freely to visit him and without any ceremony makes known his wants although perhaps he never had any acquaintance with him before the host is obliged to behave according to the custom of the country and gives his guest what he has occasion for but he may afterwards return the visit and must be received in the same manner  Government Laws c  BEFORE the Russian conquest they lived in perfect freedom having no chief being subject to no law nor paying any taxes  the old men or those who were remarkable for their bravery bearing the principal authority in their villages though none had right to command or inflict punishment  If any one kills another he is to be killed by the relations of the person slain They burn the hands of those who are frequently caught in theft but for the first offence the thief must restore what he hath stolen and live alone in solitude without expecting any assistance from others They never have any disputes about their land or their huts every one having land and water more than sufficient for his wants  But in every Ostrog or large village now by order of her Imperial Majesty is appointed a chief who is sole judge in all causes except those of life and death  They think themselves however the happiest people in the world and look upon the Russians who are settled among them with contempt But this notion begins to change for the old people who are confirmed in their customs drop off and the young ones being converted to Christianity adopt the customs of the Russians and despise the barbarity and superstition of their ancestors  Religion c  THE Camchatcans like other barbarous nations have no notions of a Deity but what are absurd ridiculous and shocking to a humanised mind They call their God  Kutchu  but they pay him no religious worship and the only use they make of his name is to divert themselves with it they relate such scandalous stories of him as one would be ashamed to repeat Amongst other things they reproach him with having made so many steep hills so many small and rapid rivers so much rain and so many storms and in all the troubles that happen to them upbraid and blaspheme him They however celebrate always three days in the month of November hence called the Month of Purification after their summer or harvest labour is over they look upon it as a sin to do any work or make any visits before these holidays the breach of which they never suffer to pass without expiation From hence we may see that the ancestors of these people were accustomed to offer up the firstfruits of their summer labours to God and at the same time make merry with one another Their ceremonies in the  celebration of their holidays are extremely silly and consist of many ridiculous antics  They place a pillar upon a large wide plain which they bind round with rags Whenever they pass this pillar they throw a piece of fish or some other victuals to it and near it they never gather any berries or kill any beasts or birds This offering they think preserves their lives which otherwise would be shortened however they offer nothing which can be of use to themselves but only the fins and tails of fish or such things as they would be obliged to throw away In this all the people of Asia agree offering only such things as are useless to themselves Besides these pillars several other places are reckoned sacred such as burning and smoaking mountains hot springs and some particular woods which they imagine are inhabited by devils The world they believe is eternal and the soul immortal and that it shall be again joined to the body and live eternally subject to fatigues and troubles as in this present life with this difference only that they shall have greater plenty of all the necessaries of life even the very smallest animal they imagine will rise again and dwell under the earth They think the earth is flat and that under it  there is a firmament like ours and under that firmament another earth in which when we have summer they have winter and when we have winter they have summer With regard to future rewards and punishments they believe that in the other world the rich will be poor and the poor rich  Their notions of vice and virtue are equally extravagant They believe every thing lawful that procures them the satisfaction of their wishes and passions and think that only to be sin from which they apprehend danger or ruin so that they neither reckon murder selfmurder adultery oppression nor the like any wickedness on the contrary they look upon it to be a mortal sin to save any one that is drowning because according to their notions whoever saves him will be soon drowned himself They account it likewise a sin to bathe in or drink hot water or to go up to the burning mountains They have besides these innumerable absurd customs such as scraping the snow from their feet with a knife or whetting their hatchets upon the road This may however be said that they are not the only people who have ridiculous superstitions  Besides the abovementioned gods they pay a religious regard to several animals from which they apprehend danger They offer fire at the holes of sables and foxes when fishing they intreat the whales or seahorses not to overturn their boats and in hunting beseech the bears and wolves not to hurt them  They fill almost every place in Heaven and earth with different spirits and offer them sacrifices upon every occasion Some carry little idols about them or have them placed in their dwellings but with regard to God they not only neglect to worship him but in case of troubles and misfortunes they curse and blaspheme him  Every old woman is looked upon as a witch and an interpreter of dreams and there are persons who pretend to conjure In their conjurations they whisper upon the fins of fish and some other things by which means they think they cure diseases divert misfortunes and foretel futurity They are in general great observers of dreams which they relate to one another as soon as they awake in the morning judging from thence of their future good or bad fortune and some of these dreams have their interpretation fixed and settled Besides this  they pretend to chiromancy and to foretel a man's good or bad fortune by the lines of his hand but the rules which they follow are kept a great secret  All this ignorance and superstition however will soon be rooted out from amongst them chapels of worship being built in almost every village and schools erected to which the Camchatcans send their children with great pleasure  Courtships Marriages c  WHEN a Camchatcan resolves to marry he looks about for a bride in some of the neighbouring villages seldom in his own and when he finds one to his mind he discovers his inclination to the parents desiring that he may have the liberty of serving them for some time this permission he easily obtains and during his service he shews an uncommon zeal to satisfy them in whatever he does The time of his service expired he desires liberty to seize his bride and if he has happened to please the parents his bride and her relations his request is presently granted but if they disapprove of it they dismiss him with some small reward for his services It sometimes happens  that these bridegrooms without discovering any thing of their intention engage themselves in service in some distant village and though every one suspects their design yet no notice is taken of it till they declare it  When a bridegroom obtains the liberty of seizing his bride he seeks every opportunity of finding her alone or in the company of but a few people for during this time all the women in the village are obliged to protect her besides she has two or three different coats and is so swathed round with fishnets and straps that she has scarce more motion than a statue If the bridegroom happens to find her alone or with few in company he throws himself upon her and begins to tear off her cloaths for to strip the bride naked constitutes the ceremony of marriage This is not always an easy task for though she herself makes little resistance and indeed she can make but little yet if there happen to be many women near they all fall upon the bridegroom without mercy beating and dragging him by the hair scratching his face and using every other method they can think of to prevent him from accomplishing his design If the bridegroom is so happy as to obtain his wish he immediately runs from  her and the bride as a proof of her being conquered calls him back with a soft and tender voice and thus the marriage is concluded This victory is seldom obtained at once but some times the contest lasts a whole year and after every attempt the bridegroom is obliged to take some time to recover strength and to cure the wounds he has received There is an instance of one who after having persevered for seven years instead of obtaining his bride was rendered quite a cripple the women having used him very barbarously  As soon as the ceremony is over he is at liberty next night to go to her bed and the day following carries her off to his own village After some time the bride and the bridegroom return to the bride's relations where the marriage feast is celebrated in the following manner of which the writer of this account was an eye witness in  The bridegroom his friends and wife visited the fatherinlaw in three boats All the women were in the boats and the men being naked pushed them along with poles About one hundered paces from the village to which they were going they landed began to sing and used conjurations with tow fastened upon a rod muttering  something over a dried fish's head which they wrapped in the tow and gave to an old woman to hold The conjuration being over they put upon the bride a coat of sheep's skin and tied four images about her thus loaded she had some difficulty to move They then returned to their boats and came up to the village where they landed a second time at this landingplace a boy of the village met them and taking the bride by the hand led her along all the women following  When the bride came to the hut they tied a strap round her by which she was let down the stairs the old woman who carried the fish's head going before her This head she laid down at the foot of the stairs where it was trodden upon by the bride and bridegroom and all the people present and then thrown into the fire  All the strangers took their places having first stripped the bride of superfluous ornaments The bridegroom heated the hut and dressed the victuals which they had brought with them and entertained the inhabitants of the village The next day the master of the hut entertained the strangers with great abundance who on the third day departed the bride and bridegroom only remained to work some time with their  father The superfluous part of the bride's dress which was taken from her was distributed among the relations who were obliged to return her presents of far greater value  These ceremonies only relate to a first marriage for in the marriage of a widow the man and woman's agreement is sufficient but he must not take her to himself before her fins are taken away This can only be done by some stranger lying with her once but as this taking off of sin was looked upon by the Camchatcans as very dishonourable for the man it was formerly difficult to find one to undertake it so that the poor widows were at a great loss before the Russians came amongst them since which they have been in no great want of strangers to take away their sins  Marriage is forbidden only between father and daughter mother and son a soninlaw may marry his motherinlaw and a fatherinlaw his daughterinlaw and first cousins marry frequently Their divorce is very easy consisting only in a man's separating beds from his wife In such cases the man immediately marries again and the woman accepts of another husband without any further ceremony  A Camchatcan hath two or three wives with whom he sleeps by turns Sometimes he keeps them all in one hut and sometimes in different huts With every maid that he marries he is obliged to go through the abovementioned ceremonies Though these people are fond of women yet they are not so jealous as the Koreki In their marriages they do not seem to regard the marks of virginity Nor are the women more jealous for two or three wives live with one husband in all harmony even though he should also keep several concubines  Birth of Children c  IN general these people are not fruitful for it does not appear that any one man has had ten children by the same woman Their women as they say have commonly very easy births for in a quarter of an hour afterwards they will appear abroad about their ordinary business and without any change of countenance They have no professed midwives and for the most part the mother or nearest relation performs the office  Women who desire to have children eat spiders for that purpose To prevent conception they use several herbs and different conjurations  Some of them are such unnatural wretches as to destroy their children when they are born or throw them alive to the dogs When a woman bears twins one of them at least must be destroyed and so must a child born in very stormy weather though the last can be avoided by some conjurations After the birth the women to recover their strength eat fish broth made with an herb which they call  hale  and in a few days return to their ordinary diet  Diseases and Remedies  THE principal diseases in Camchatca are the scurvy boils palsy cancer jaundice and the venereal distemper These diseases they think are inflicted upon them by the spirits that inhabit some particular groves if ignorantly they happen to out down any of them Their chief remedies consist in charms and conjurations but at the same time they do not neglect the use of herbs and roots For the scurvy they use a certain herb which they rub upon their gums as also the leaves of the cranberry and blackberry The Russians cure themselves with decoctions of the tops of cedar and by eating wild garlic  Boils are a most dangerous disease in Camchatca causing the death of numbers The palsy cancer and French disease are supposed to be incurable the last they say was not heard of before the arrival of the Russians There is likewise another distemper which they call the  sushutch  which is a sort of scab that surrounds the whole body under the ribs like a girdle When this does not come to suppurate and fall off it is mortal and they say every one must have this once in his lifetime as we have the smallpox  When they are bitten by a dog or wolf they lay the bruised leaves of the ulmaria upon the wound drinking at the same time a decoction of them this decoction they also administer in the bellyach and scurvy The leaves and stalks bruised they use in burns The decoction of this herb mixed with fish they use also in the toothach holding it warm in their mouths and laying a piece of the root upon the affected tooth They use a species of gentian in the scurvy and almost against every disorder  In the jaundice they have a medicine which they consider as infallible They take the roots of the iris sylvestris and after cleaning them beat them in warm water and use the juice  which they squeeze out as a clyster continuing it for two days two or three times a day this produces a purging and generally gives great relief After some time if the cure is not completed they repeat it They neither use lancets nor cuppingglasses but with a pair of wooden pincers draw up the skin and pierce it with an instrument of crystal made on purpose letting out as much blood as they want  In pains of the back they rub the part affected before the fire with a root of the cicuta being careful not to touch the loins which they say would produce spasms In pains of the joints they place upon the part a little pyramid made of a fungus which grows upon the birchtrees and set the top of it on fire letting it burn till it comes to the skin which then cracks and leaves a wound that yields a great quantity of matter This wound they cure with the ashes of the fungus but give themselves no trouble at all about it The root of the anemonides or ranunculus is made use of to hurt or poison their enemies and they likewise poison their arrows with it  Burials  INSTEAD of burying or laying the dead bodies in some hole the Camchatcans  bind a strap round the neck of the corpse draw it out and leave it near the hut to be devoured by their dogs for those say they who are eaten by dogs will drive with fine dogs in the other world and by leaving them near the hut they suppose that the evil spirits whom they imagine to have been the occasion of their death seeing the dead body may be satisfied with the mischief they have done However they frequently remove to some other place when any one has died in the hut leaving the corpse behind them in it  They throw away all the cloaths of the deceased not because they imagine they shall have occasion for them in the other world but because they believe that whoever wears the cloaths of one that is dead will certainly come to an untimely end  After the burial of the dead they use the following purification going to the wood they cut some rods of which they make a ring and creeping through it twice they carry it to the wood and throw it towards the west Those who dragged out the body are obliged to catch two birds of one sort or other one of which they burn and eat the other with the whole family The purification is performed on the same  day for before this they dare not enter any other hut nor will any one else enter their's In commemoration of the dead the whole family dine upon a fish the fins of which they burn in the fire  Language  THE Camchatcans have this particular custom that they endeavour to give every thing a name in their language which may express the property of it but if they do not understand the thing quite well themselves they then take a name from some foreign language which perhaps has no relation to the thing itself as for example they call a priest  Bogbog  because probably they hear him use the word bogbog God Bread they call  Brightatin Augsh  that is Russian root and thus the several other words to which their language is a stranger  It appears likely that the Camchatcans lived formerly in Mungalia beyond the river Amur and made one people with the Mungals which is farther confirmed by the following observations such as the Camchatcans having several words common to the Mungal Chinese language as their terminations in  ong ing oang chin cha ching ksi ksung  it would  be still a greater proof if we could shew scveral words and sentences the same in both languages  Character Customs c  THE Camchatcans are remarkable for their cowardice boasting and slavishness to people who use them hard and for their obstinacy and contempt of those who treat them with gentleness  They are also very far from being a cleanly people their manner of living is slovenly to the last degree they never wash their hands nor face nor cut their nails they eat out of the same dish with the dogs which they never wash they never comb their heads but both men and women plait their hair in two locks binding the ends with small ropes When any hair starts out they sew it with threads to make it lie close by this means they have such a quantity of lice that they can scrape them off by handfuls and they are nasty enough even to eat them Those that have not natural hair sufficient wear false locks sometimes as much as weigh ten pounds which makes their heads look like a haycock  They place their chief happiness in idleness and satisfying their natural lust and appetites which incline them to singing dancing and relating of love stories and think it more eligible to die than to lead a disagreeable life which opinion frequently leads them to selfmurder This was so common after the conquest that the Russians had great difficulty to put a stop to it They have no notion of riches fame or honour therefore covetousness ambition and pride are unknown among them On the other hand they are careless cruel and lustful these vices occasion frequent quarrels and wars among them sometimes with their neighbours not from a desire of encreasing their power but from some other causes such as the carrying off their provisions or rather their girls which is frequently practised as the most summary method of procuring a wife  When any man seeks the friendship of another he invites him to his hut and for his entertainment dresses as much of his best victuals as might serve ten people As soon as the stranger comes into the hut which is made hot for his reception both he and the host strip  themselves naked then great plenty of victuals is set before the guest and whilst he is eating the host throws water upon redhot stones until he makes the hut insupportably hot The stranger endeavours all he can to bear this excessive heat and to eat up all the victuals whilst the host is still endeavouring to oblige him to complain of the heat and beg to be excused from eating all up It is reckoned a dishonour to the host and a mark of niggardliness if he should not be able to accomplish this He himself eats nothing during the whole time and is allowed to go out of the hut but the stranger is not suffered to stir until he acknowledges himself overcome At these feasts they over eat themselves to such a degree that for three days they cannot bear the sight of victuals and are scarce able to move  When the stranger is gorged and can no longer endure the heat he purchases his dismission with presents of dogs cloaths or whatever else is agreeable to his host This however is no injury but a proof of friendship for he expects in turn to use his friend in the same manner  In their banquets they treat their friends much in the same way except that they do not torment them with heat nor expect any presents When they entertain with the fat of seals or whales they cut it out in slices and the host kneeling before his company with one of these slices in one hand and a knife in the other thrusts the fat into their mouths crying in a surly tone  Ta na  and with his knife cuts off all that hangs out of their mouths after they are crammed as full as they can hold Whoever wants any thing from another may generally obtain it upon these occasions for it is reckoned dishonourable for the guest to refuse his generous host any thing  It is very diverting to see them attempt to count above ten for having reckoned the fingers of both hands they clasp them together which signifies ten then they begin with their toes and count to twenty after which they are quite confounded and cry  Metcha  that is 'Where shall I take more' They reckon ten months in the year some of which are longer and some shorter for they do not divide them by the changes of the moon but by the order of particular occurrences that happen in those regions they commonly divide our year into  two so that winter is one year and summer another the summer year begins in May the winter in November  They do not distinguish the days by any particular appellation nor form them into weeks or months nor yet know how many days are in the month or year They mark their epochs by some remarkable thing or other such as the Arrival of the Russians the Great Rebellion or the First Expedition to Camchatca  They are ignorant of the causes of eclipses but when they happen they carry fire out of their huts and pray the luminary eclipsed to shine as formerly They know only three constellations the Great Bear the Pleiades and the three stars in Orion and give names only to the principal winds  Such was the general state of these people when the Russians first came among them but now by the care of the Empress Elizabeth missionaries are appointed to civilize them and teach them the Christian faith In a clergyman was sent by the synod with assistants and every thing necessary for the purpose and for building a church which has been attended with such success that many of them are baptised and all as was said before send their  children very readily to the schools opened in many places for their instruction so that in a few years we may hope to see the Christian faith planted in all these northern countries  THE INDEX  A  AMBRYM ISLE Page  APEE ibid  AURORA  C  CAMCHATCA  Face of the Country  Productions ibid  Inhabitants  Dress  Food  Habitations
