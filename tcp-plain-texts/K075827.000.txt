 OSRIC  THE LION  A  ROMANCE  London  PRINTED IN THE YEAR MDCCXCVII  OSRICTHE LION  A ROMANCE  SWIFT roll the Rhine's billows and water the plains  Where Falkenstein Castle's majestic remains  Their mosscover'd turrets still rear  Oft loves the gaunt wolf midst the ruins to prowl  What Time from the battlements pours the lone owl  Her plaints in the passenger's ear  No longer resound through the vaults of yon hall  The song of the minstrel and mirth of the ball  Those pleasures for ever are fled  There now dwells the bat with her lightshunning brood  There ravens and vultures now clamour for food  And all is dark silent and dread  Ha Dost thou not see by the Moon's trembling light  Directing his steps where advances a Knight  His eye big with vengeance and fate  'Tis Osricthe Lion his Nephew who leads  And swift up the crackling old staircase proceeds  Gains the hall and quick closes the gate  Now round him young Carloman casting his eyes  Surveys the sad scene with dismay and surprize  And fear steals the rose from his cheeks  His spirits forsake him his courage is flown  The hand of Sir Osric he clasps in his own  And while his voice falters he speaks  "Dear Uncle" he murmurs "why linger we here  'Tis late and these chambers are damp and are drear  Keen blows through the ruins the blast  Oh let us away and our journey pursue  Fair Blumenberg's Castle will rise on our view  Soon as Falkenstein Forest is past  "Why roll thus your eyeballs Why glare they so wild  Oh chide not my weakness nor frown that a child  Should view these apartments with dread  For know that full oft have I heard from my Nurse  There still on this Castle has rested a curse  Since innocent blood here was shed  "She said too bad spirits and ghosts all in white  Here use to resort at the dead time of night  Nor vanish till breaking of day  And still at their coming is heard the deep tone  Of a bellloud and awfulHark hark 'twas a groan  Good Uncle oh let us away"  "Peace serpent" thus Osricthe Lion replies  While rage and malignity gloom in his eyes  "Thy journey and life here must close  Thy Castle's proud turrets no more shalt thou see  No more betwixt Blumenberg's Lordship and me  Shalt thou stand and my greatness oppose  "My Brother lies breathless on Palestine's plains  And though once remov'd to his noble domains  My right can no rival deny  Then stripling prepare on my dagger to bleed  No succour is near and thy fate is decreed  Commend thee to Jesus and die"  Thus saying he seizes the boy by the arm  Whose grief rends the vaulted hall's roof while alarm  His heart of all fortitude robs  His limbs sink beneath him distracted with fears  He falls at his Uncle's feet bathes them with tears  And"Spare me Oh spare me" he sobs  But ah 'tis in vain that he strives to appease  The miscreant in vain does he cling round his knees  And sue in soft accents for life  Unmov'd by his sorrowunmov'd by his pray'r  Fierce Osric has twisted his hand in his hair  And aims at his bosom a knife  But e'er the steel blushes with blood strange to tell  Selfstruck does the tongue of the hollowton'd bell  The presence of midnight declare  And while with amazement his hair bristles high  Hears Osric a voice loud and terrible cry  In sounds heart appalling"Forbear"  Straight curses and shrieks thro' the chambers resound  With hellish mirth mingled the walls shake around  The groaning roof threatens to fall  Loud bellows the thunder blue lightnings still flash  The casements they clatter chains rattle doors clash  And flames spread their waves through the hall  The clamour increases the portals expand  O'er the pavement's black marble now rushes a band  Of daemons all dropping with gore  In visage so grim and so monstrous in height  That Carloman screams as they burst on his sight  And sinks without sense on the floor  Not so his fell Uncle he sees that the throng  Impels loudly shrieking a female along  And well the sad spectre he knows  The daemons with curses her steps onward urge  Her shoulders with whips form'd of serpents they scourge  And fast from her wounds the blood flows  "Oh welcome" she cry'd and her voice spoke despair  Oh welcome Sir Osric the torments to share  Of which thou hast made me the prey  Twelve years have I languish'd thy coming to see  Ulrilda who perish'd dishonour'd by thee  Now calls thee to anguish away  My ruin compleated thy love became hate  Thy hand gave the draught which consign'd me to Fate  Nor thought I death lurk'd in the bowl  Unfit for the grave stain'd with guilt swell'd with pride  Unblest unabsolv'd unrepenting I dy'd  And daemons straight seiz'd on my soul  "Thou com'st and with transport I feel my breast swell  Full long I have suffer'd the torments of hell  And now shall its pleasures be mine  See see how the fiends are athirst for thy blood  Twelve years has my panting heart furnish'd their food  Come wretch let them feast upon thine"  She said and the daemons their prey flock'd around  They dash'd him with horrible yell on the ground  And blood down his limbs trickl'd fast  His eyes from their sockets with fury they tore  They fed on his entrails all reeking with gore  And his heart was Ulrilda's repast  But now the grey cock told the coming of day  The fiends with their victim straight vanish'd away  And Carloman's heart throbb'd again  With terror recalling the deeds of the night  He rose and from Falkenstein speeding his flight  Soon reach'd his paternal domain  Since then all with horror the ruins behold  No shepherd though stray'd be a lamb from his fold  No mother though lost be her child  The fugitive dares in these chambers to seek  Where fiends nightly revel and guilty ghosts shriek  In accents most fearful and wild  Oh shun them ye pilgrims tho' late be the hour  Tho' loud howl the tempest and fast fall the show'r  From Falkenstein Castle be gone  There still their said banquet Hell's denizens share  There Osricthe Lion still raves in despair  Breathe a prayer for his soul and pass on
