 DR GOLDSMITH's ROMAN HISTORY ABRIDGED by HIMSELF For the USE of SCHOOLS  LONDON Printed for S BAKER and G LEIGH in YorkStreet T DAVIES in RusselStreet CoventGarden and L DAVIS in Holborn MDCCLXXII  ADVERTISEMENT  THE present Abridgement was suggested by the Heads of some of our principal Schools It was thought that the substance of the Roman History thrown into easy  narrative  would excite the curiosity of Youth much more agreeably than in the common dry mode of  Question and Answer  calculated to turn into  task  a species of instruction meant certainly for  entertainment  Lately Published  THE ROMAN HISTORY From the FOUNDATION of the CITY OF ROME To the DESTRUCTION of the WESTERN EMPIRE BY DR GOLDSMITH In TWO VOLUMES vo Price s  PREFACE To the OCTAVO EDITION of DR GOLDSMITH's ROMAN HISTORY  "THERE are some subjects on which a writer must decline all attempts to acquire fame satisfied with being obscurely useful After such a number of Roman Histories in all languages ancient and modern it would be but imposture to pretend new discoveries or to expect to offer any thing in a work of this kind which has not been often anticipated by others The facts which it relates have been an hundred times repeated and ever occurrence has been so variously considered that learning can scarely find a new anecdote or genius give novelty to the old  "I HOPE therefore for the reader's indulgence if in the following attempt it shall appear that my only aim was to supply a concise plain and unaffected narrative of the rise and decline of a well known empire I was contented to make such a book as could not fail of being serviceable though of all others the most unlikely to promote the reputation of the writer Instead therefore of pressing forward among the ambitious I only claim the merit of knowing my own strength and falling back among the hindmost ranks with conscious inferiority  "I AM not ignorant however that it would be no such difficult task to pursue the same arts by which many dull men every day acquire a reputation in history such might easily be attained by fixing on some obscure period to write upon where much seeming erudition might be displayed almost unknown because not worth remembering and many maxims in politics might be  advanced entirely new because altogether false But I have pursued a contrary method chusing the most noted periods in history and offering no remarks but such as I thought strictly true  "THE reasons of my choice were that we had no history of this splendid period in our language but what was either too voluminous for common use or too meanly written to please Catrou and Rouille's History in six volumes folio translated into our language by Bundy is entirely unsuited to the time and expence mankind usually chuse to bestow upon this subject Rollin and his continuator Crevier making above thirty volumes octavo seem to labour under the same imputation as likewise Hooke who has spent three quartos upon the republic alone the rest or his undertaking remaining unfinished  A fourth volume has been since published  There only therefore remained the History by Echard in five volumes octavo whose plan and mine  seemed to coincide and had his execution been equal to his design it had precluded the present undertaking But the truth is it is so poorly written the facts so crowded the narration so spiritless and the characters so indistinctly marked that the most ardent curiosity must cool in the perusal and the noblest transactions that ever warmed the human heart as described by him must cease to interest  "I HAVE endeavoured therefore in the present work or rather compilation to obviate the inconveniencies arising from the exuberance of the former as well as from the unpleasantness of the latter Too much time may be given even to laudable pursuits and there is none more apt than this to allure the student from more necessary branches of learning and if I may so express it entirely to engross his industry What is here offered therefore may be suffi  ient for all but such as make history the peculiar business of their  lives to such the most tedious narrative will seem but an abridgement as they measure the merits of a work rather by the quantity than the quality of its contents Others however who think more soberly will agree that in so extensive a field as that of the transactions of Rome more judgment may be shewn by selecting what is important than by adding what is obscure The history of this empire has been extended to six volumes folio and I aver that with very little learning it might be encreased to sixteen more but what would this be but to load the subject with unimportant facts and so to weaken the narration that like the empire it described it must necessarily sink beneath the weight of its own acquisitions  "BUT while I thus have endeavoured to avoid prolixity it was found no easy matter to prevent crowding the facts and to give every narrative its proper play In reality no art can contrive to avoid opposite defects he who indulges in  minute particularities will be often languid and he who studies conciseness will as frequently be dry and unentertaining As it was my aim to comprize as much as possible in the smallest compass it is feared the work will often be subject to the latter imputation but it was impossible to furnish the public with a cheap Roman history and at the same time to give all that warmth to the narrative all those colourings to the description which works of twenty times the bulk have room to exhibit I shall be fully satisfied therefore if it furnishes an interest sufficient to allure the reader to the end and this is a claim to which few abridgements can justly make pretensions  "To these objections there are some who may add that I have rejected many of the modern improvements in Roman history and that every character is left in full possession of that fame or infamy which it obtained from its cotemporaries or those who wrote immediately  after I acknowledge the charge for it appears now too late to rejudge the virtues or the vices of those men who were but very incompletely known even to their own historians The Romans perhaps upon many occasions formed wrong ideas of virtue but they were by no means so ignorant or abandoned in general as not to give their brightest characters the greatest share of their applause and I do not know whether it be fair to try pagan actions by the standard of Christian morality  "BUT whatever may be my execution of this work I have very little doubts about the success of the undertaking the subject is the noblest that ever employed human attention and instead of requiring a writer's aid wi  l even support him with its splendor The empire of the world rising from the meanest origin and growing great by a strict veneration for religion and an implicit confidence in its commanders continually changing the mode but seldom the spirit of  its government being a constitution in which the military power whether under the name of citizens or soldiers almost always prevailed adopting all the improvements of other nations with the most indefatigable industry and submitting to be taught by those whom it afterwards subdued this is a picture that must affect us however it be disposed these materials must have their value under the hand of the meanest workman"  THE HISTORY OF THE Commonwealth of Rome  CHAPTER I Of the original of the Romans  THE Romans were particularly desirous of being thought descended from the gods as if to hide the meanness of their real ancestry Aeneas the son of Venus and Anchises having escaped from the destruction of Troy after many adventures and dangers arrived in Italy AM where he was kindly received by Latinus king of the Latins who gave him his daughter Lavinia in marriage Turnus king of the Rutuli was the first who opposed Aeneas he having long made pretensions to Lavinia himself A war ensued in which the Trojan hero was victorious and Turnus slain In consequence of this  Aeneas built a city which was called Lavinium in honour of his wife and some time after engaging in another war against Mezentius one of the petty kings of the country he was vanquished in turn and died in battle after a reign of four years  Numitor the fifteenth king in a direct line from Aeneas who took possession of the kingdom in consequence of his father's will had a brother named Amulius to whom were left the treasures which had been brought from Troy As riches but too generally prevail against right Amu  ius made use of his wealth to supplant his brother and soon found means to possess himself of the kingdom Not content with the crime of usurpation he added that of murder also Numitor's sons first fell a sacrifice to his suspicions and to remove all apprehensions of being one day disturbed in is ill got power he caused Rhea Silvia his brother's only daughter to become a vestal virgin which office obliging her to perpetual celibacy made him less uneasy as to the claims of posterity  His precautions however were all frustrated in the event for Rhea Sylvia going to fetch water from a neighbouring grove was met and ravished by a man whom perhaps to palliate her offence she averred to be Mars the god of war From this congress she was brought to bed of two boys who were no sooner born than devoted by the usurper to destruction The mother was condemned to be buried alive the usual punishment for vestals who had violated their chastity and the twins were ordered to be flung into the river Tyber It happened at the time this rigorous sentence was put into execution that the river had more than usually overflowed its banks so that the place where the children were thrown being at a distance from the main cur  ent the water was too shallow to drown them In this situation therefore they continued without harm  and that no part of their preservation might want its wonders we are told that they were for some time suckled by a wolf until Faustulus the king's herdsman finding them thus ex  osed brought them home to Acca Laurentia his wife who brought them up as his own  Romulus and Remus the twins thus strangely preserved seemed early to discover abilities and desires above the meanness of their supposed original The shepherd's life began to displease them and from tending flocks or hunting wild beasts they soon turned their strength against the robbers round the country whom they often stript of their plunder to share it among their fellow shepherds In one of these excursions Remus was taken prisoner by Nu  tor's herdsman who brought him before the king  accused of being a plunderer Romulus how  er being informed by Faustulus of his real birth  not remiss in assembling a number of his fellow  who beset the usurper on all sides who dur  ng his amazement and distraction was taken and  while Numitor who had been deposed forty  ve  ts recognized his grandsons and was once  rest  ed to the throne  Numitor being thus in quiet possession of the  gdom his grandsons resolved to build a city upon  se hills where they had formerly lived as shep  er  Many of the neighbouring shepherds also t  such as were fond of change repaired to the in  led city and prepared to raise it In order to pro  ct in this undertaking with all possible solemnity  e two brothers were advised by the king to take  en from the slight of birds and that he whose  a  n should be most favourable should in all re  ects direct the other In compliance with this advice they both took their stations upon different h  s To Remus appeared six vultures to Romulus twice that number so that each party thought  itself victorious the one having the first omen the other the most complete This produced a contest which ended in a battle wherein Remus was slain and it is even said that he was killed by his brother who being provoked at his leaping contemptuously over the city wall struck him dead upon the spot  Romulus being now sole commander and eighteen years of age began the foundation of a city that was one day to give laws to the world It was called Rome after the name of the sounder and built upon the Palatine hill on which he had taken his successful omen A M ante c The city was at first almost square containing about a thousand houses It was near a mile in compass and commanded a small territory round it of about eight miles ever However small as it appears it was notwithstanding worse inhabited and the first method made use of to increase its numbers was the opening a sanctuary for all malefactors slaves and such as were desirous of novelty and these came in great multitudes and contributed to increase the number of our legislator's new subjects  CHAP II From the building of Rome to the death of Romulus  SCARCE was the city raised above its foundation when its rude inhabitants began to think of giving some form to their constifution Romulus by an act of great generosity left them at liberty to chuse whom they would for their king and they in gratitude concurred to elect their founder he was accordingly acknowledged as chief of their religion sovereign magistrate of Rome and general of the army Beside a guard to attend his person it was  agreed that he should be precede wherever he went by twelve men armed with axes tied up in a bundle of rods who were to serve as executioners of the law and to impress his new subjects with an idea of his authority  The senate which was to act as counsellors to the king was composed of an hundred of the principal citizens of Rome consisting of men whose age wisdom or valour gave them a natural authority over their fellowsubjects and the king named the first senator and appointed him to the government of the city whenever war required his own absence  The plebeians who composed the third part of the legislature assumed to themselves the power of authorizing those laws which were passed by the king or the senate All things relative to peace or war to the election of magistrates and even to the  sing a king were confirmed by suffrages in their assemblies  The first care of the newcreated king was to attend to the interests of religion but the precise form of their worship is unknown The greatest part of the religion of that age consisted in a firm reliance upon the credit of their soothsayers who pretended from observations on the flight of birds and the entrails of beasts to direct the present and to dive into futurity Romulus by an express law o  ended that no election should be made no enterprize undertaken without first consulting them  Wives were forbid upon any pretext whatsoever to separate from their husbands while on the contrary the husband was empowered to repudiate the wi  e and even in some cases to put her to death His laws between children and their parents were yet still more severe the father had entire power over his offspring both of fortune and life he could se  them or imprison them at any time of their lives or in any stations to which they were arrived  After his endeavours by laws to regulate his subjects he next gave orders to ascertain their numbers The whole amounted but to three thousand foot and about as many hundred horsemen capable of bearing arms These therefore were divided equally into three tribes and to each he assigned a different part of the city Each of these tribes were subdivided into ten curiae or companies consisting of an hundred men each with a centurion to command it a priest called curio to perform the sacrifices and two of the principle inhabitants called duumviri to distribute justice  By these wise regulations each day added strength to the new city multitudes flocked in from all the adjacent towns and it only seemed to want women to ascertain its duration In this exigence Romulus by the advice of the senate sent deputies among the Sabines his neighbours entreating their alliance and upon these terms offering to cement the most strict confederacy with them The Sabines who were then considered as the most warlike people of Italy rejected the proposal with disdain Romulus therefore proclaimed a feast in honour of Neptune throughout all the neighbouring villages and made the most magnificent preparations for it These feasts were generally preceded by sacrifices and ended in shews of wrestlers gladiators and chariotcourses The Sabines as he had expected were among the foremost who came to be spectators bringing their wives and daughters with them to share the pleasure of the sight In the mean time the games began and while the strangers were most intent upon the spectacle a number of the Roman youth rushed in among them with drawn swords seized the youngest and most beautiful women and carried them off by violence In vain the parents protested against this breach of hospitality in vain the virgins themselves at first opposed the attempts of their ravishers perseverance  and caresses obtained those favours which timidity at first denied so that the betrayers from being objects of aversion soon became the partners of their dearest affections  A bloody war ensued The cities of Cenina Antemna and Crustumium were the first who resolved to revenge the common cause which the Sabines seemed too dilatory in pursuing But all these by making separate inroads became a more easy conquest to Romulus who made the most merciful use of his victory instead of destroying their towns or lessening their numbers he only placed colonies of Romans in them to serve as a frontier to repress more distant invasions  Tatius king of Cures a Sabine city was the last although the most formidable who undertook to revenge the disgrace his country had suffered He entered the Roman territories at the head of twentyfive thousand men and not content with a superiority of forces he added stratagem also Tarpiea who was daughter to the commander of the Capitol  ne hill happened to fall into his hands as she went without the walls of the city to fetch water Upon her he prevailed by means of large promises to betray one of the gates to his army The reward she engaged for was what the soldiers wore on their arms by which she meant their bracelets They however either mistaking her meaning or willing to punish her persidy threw their bucklers upon her as they entered and crushed her to death The S  bine being thus possessed of the Capitoline after s  me time a general engagement ensued which w  s renewed for several days with almost equal suc  ss and neither could think of submitting it was  the valley between the Capitoline and Quirinal  that the last engagement was fought between  Romans and the Sabines The engagement was n  w become general and the slaughter prodigious  when the attention of both sides was suddenly turned from the scence of horror before them to another till at length the Sabine women who had been carried off by the Romans with their hair loose and their ornaments neglected flew in between the combatants regardless of their own danger and with loud outcries implored their husbands and their children to desist Upon this the combatants as if by mutual impulse let fall their weapons an accommodation ensued by which it was agreed that Romulus and Tatius should reign jointly in Rome with equal power and prerogative that an hundred Sabines should be admitted into the senate that the city should still retain its former name but that the citizens should be called Quirites after Cures the principal town of the Sabines and that both nations being thus united such of the Sabines as chose it should be admitted to live in and enjoy all the privileges of citizens in Rome Tatius was killed about five years after by the Lavinians for having protected some servants of his who had plundered them and slain their ambassadors so that by this accident Romulus once more saw himself sole monarch of Rome  Successes like these produced an equal share of pride in the conqueror From being contented with those limits which had been wisely assigned to his power he began to affect absolute sway and to govern those laws to which he had himself formerly professed implicit obedience The senate was particularly displeased at his conduct as they found themselves only used as instruments to ratify the rigour of his commands We are not told the precise manner which they employed to get rid of the tyrant some say that he was torn in pieces in the senatehouse others that he disappeared while reviewing his army certain it is that from the secrecy of the fact and the concealment of the body they took occasion  persuade the multitude that he  was taken up into heaven thus him whom they could not bear as a king they were contented to worship as a god Romulus reigned thirtyseven years and after his death had a temple built to him under the name of Quirinius  CHAP III From the death of Romulus to the death of Numa Pompilus the second king of Rome U C  UPON the death of Romulus the city seemed g  eatly divided in the choice of a successor The Sabines were for having a king chosen from their  but the Romans could not bear the thoughts of  ncing a stranger to the throne In this perplexity the senators undertook to supply the place of the king by taking the government each of them in  for five days and during that time enjoying  the honours and all the privileges of royalty This new form of government continued for a year  t the plebians who saw that this method of transf  ing power was only multiplying their masters  a  d upon altering that mode of government T  senate being thus driven to an election at length  upon Numa Pompilius a Sabine and their  was received with universal approbation by the  Pompilius who was now about forty had  eminent for his piety his justice mode  d exemplary life He was skilled in all  and p  ilosophy of the Sabines and liv  t C  es contented with a private  unambiti  us of higher honours It was not  without reluctance that he accepted the  wh  ch when he did it produced such joy  people seemed not so much to receive a king    No monarch could be more proper for them than Numa at a conjuncture when the government was composed of various petty states lately subdued and but ill united among each other they wanted a master who could by his laws and precepts soften their fierce dispositions and by his example induce them to a love of religion and every milder virtue  Numa's whole time therefore was spent in inspiring his subjects with a love of piety and a veneration for the gods He built many new temples instituted sacred offices and feasts and the sanctity of his life gave him credit enough to persuade his people that he had a particular correspondence with the goddess Egeria By her advice he built the temple of Janus which was to be shut in time of peace and open in war he ordained vestal virgins who being four in number had very great privileges allowed them  For the encouragement of agriculture he divided those lands which Romulus had gained in war among the poorer part of the people he regulated the kalendar and abolished the distinction between Romans and Sabines by dividing the people according to their several trades and compelling them to live together Thus having arrived at the age of fourscore years and having reigned fortythree in profound peace he died ordering his body to be buried in a stone coffin contrary to the custom of the times and his books of ceremonies which consisted of twelve in Latin and as many in Greek to be buried by his side in another  CHAP IV From the death of Numa to the death of Tullus Hostilius the third king of Rome U C  UPON the death of Numa the government once more devolved upon the senate and continued till the people elected Tullus Hostilius for their king which choice had also the concurrence of the other part of the constitution This monarch who was grandson to a noble Roman who had formerly signalized himself against the Sabines was every way unl  ke his predecessor being intirely devoted to war and more fond of enterprize than even the founder of the empire himself had been so that he only sought a pretext for leading his forces into the field  The Albans were the first people who gave him an opportunity of indulging his favourite inclinations The forces of these two states met about five miles from R  me prepared to decide the fate of their respective  ngdoms for almost every battle in these times was  isive The two armies were for some time drawn o  t in array awaiting the signal to begin both chiding  length of that dreadful suspense when an unexpected proposal from the Alban general put a  the onset Stepping in between both armies  ffered the Romans a choice of deciding the dispute by single combat adding that the side whose  mpion was overcome should submit to the con  e  r A proposal like this suited the impetuous  per of the Roman King and was embraced with  his subjects each of which hoped that he  should be chosen to fight the cause of his  ntry The  e were at that time three twin brothers in each army those of the Romans were called  and those of the Albans Curiatii all six remarkable  for their courage strength and activity and to these it was resolved to commit the management of the combat At length the champions met in combat together and each totally regardless of his own safety only sought the destruction of his opponent The spectators in horrid silence trembled at every blow and wished to share the danger till fortune seemed to decide the glory of the field Victory that had hitherto been doubtful appeared to declare against the Romans they beheld two of their champions lying dead upon the plain and the three Curiatii who were wounded slowly endeavouring to pursue the survivor who seemed by flight to beg for mercy Soon however they perceived that his flight was only pretended in order to separate his antagonists whom he was unable to oppose united for quickly after stopping his course and turning upon him who followed most closely behind he laid him dead at his feet▪ the second brother who came on to assist him who was fallen only shared the same fate and now there remained but the last Curiatius to conquer who fatigued and quite disabled with his wounds slowly came up to offer an easy victory He was killed almost unresisting while the conqueror exclaiming offered him as a victim to the superiority of the Romans whom now the Albany army consented to obey  But none of the virtues of that age were without alloy the very hand that in the morning was exerted to save his country was before night embrued in the blood of a sister For returning triumphant from the f  eld it raised his indignation to behold her bathed in tears and lamenting the loss of her lover one of the Curiatii to whom she was betrothed This provoked him beyond the power of sufferance so that he flew her in a rage This action greatly displeased the senate and drew on the condemnation  of the magistrates but he was pardoned by making his appeal to the people  Hostilius died after a reign of thirtytwo years some say by lightning others with more probability by treason  CHAP V From the death of Tullus Hostilius to the death of Ancus Martius the fourth king of Rome U C  AFTER an interregnum as in the former case Ancus Martius the grandson of Numa was elected king by the people and the choice afterwards was confirmed by the senate As this monarch was a lineal descendant from Numa so he seemed to make him the great object of his imitation He instituted the sacred ceremonies which were to precede a declaration of war he took every occasion to advise his subjects to return to the arts of agriculture and to lay aside the less useful stratagems of war  These institutions and precepts were considered by the neighbouring powers rather as marks of cowardice than of wisdom The Latins therefore began to make incursions upon his territories but their success was equal to their justice Ancus conquered the Latins destroyed their cities removed their inhabitants to Rome and encreased his territories by the addition of part of theirs He quelled also an insurrection of the Veii the Fidenates and the Vols  and over the Sabines he obtained a second triumph  But his victories over the enemy were by no means comparable to his works at home in raising temples f  tifying the city making a prison for malefactors and building a sea port at the mouth of the Tiber  called Ostia by which he secured to his subjects the trade of that river and that of the salt pits adjacent Thus having enriched his subjects and beautified the city he died after a reign of twentyfour years  CHAP VI From the death of Ancus Martius to the death of Tarquinius Priscus the fifth king of Rome U C  LUCIUS Tarquinius Priscus whose original name was Lucumon and who was appointed guardian to the sons of the late king took the surname of Tarquinius from the city of Tarquinia from whence he last came His father was a merchant of Corinth who had acquired considerable wealth by trade and had settled in Italy upon account of some troubles at home His son Lucumon who inherited his fortune married a woman of family in the city of Tarquinia and as his birth profession and country were contemptible to the nobles of the place by his wife's persuasions he came to settle at Rome where merit only made distinction On his way thither say the historians as he approached the city gate an eagle stooping from above took off his hat and flying round his chariot for some time with much noise put it on again This his wife Tanaquil who it seems was skilled in augury interpreted as a presage that he should one day wear the crown and perhaps it was this which first fired his ambition to pursue it  Ancus being dead and the kingdom as usual devolving upon the senate Tarquin used all his power and arts to set aside the children of the late king and to get himself elected in their stead For this purpose upon the day appointed for election he contrived to have them sent out of the city and in  a set speech to the people in which he urged his friendship for them the fortune he had spent among them and his knowledge of their government he offered himself for their king As there was nothing in this harangue that could be contested it had the desired effect and the people with one consent elected him as their sovereign  A kingdom thus got by intrigue was notwithstanding governed with equity In the beginning of his reign in order to recompence his friends he added an hundred members more to the senate which made them in all three hundred  But his peaceful endeavours were soon interrupted by the inroads of his restless neighbours particularly the Latins over whom he triumphed and whom he forced to beg a peace He then turned his arms against the Sabines who had risen once more and had passed over the river Tyber but Tarquin attacking them with vigour routed their army so that many who escaped the sword were drowned in attempting to cross over while their bodies and armour floating down to Rome brought news of the victory even before the messengers could arrive that were sent with the tidings These conquests were follower by several advantages over the Latins from whom he took many towns though without gaining any decisive victory  Tarquin having thus forced his enemies into submission was resolved not to let his subjects corrupt in indolence but undertook and perfected several public works for the convenience and embellishment of the city  In his time also the augurs came into a great increase of reputation and he found it his interest to promote the superstition of the peple as this was in fact but to increase their obedience Tanaquil his wife was a great pretender to this art but Accius Naevius was the most celebrated adept of the kind that was  ever known in Rome Upon a certain occasion Tarquin being resolved to try the augur's skill asked him whether what he was then pondering in his mind could be effected Naevius having examined his auguries bold affirmed that it might "Why then" cries the king with an insulting smile "I had thoughts of cutting this whetstone with a razor" "Cut boldly" replied the augur and the king cut it through accordingly Thence forward nothing was undertaken in Rome without consulting the augurs and obtaining their advice and approbation  Tarquin was not content with a kingdom without also the ensigns of royalty in imitation of the Lydian kings he assumed a crown of gold an ivory throne a sceptre with an eagle on the top and robes of purple It was perhaps the splendor of these royalties that first raised the envy of the late king's sons who had now for above thirtyseven years quietly submitted to his government His design also of adopting Servius Tullius his soninlaw for his successor might have contributed to inflame their resentment Whatever was the cause of their tardy vengeance they resolved to destroy him and at last found means to effect their purpose by hiring two ruffians who demanding to speak with the king pretending that they came for justice struck him dead in his palace with the blow of an ax The lictors however who waited upon the person of the king seized the murderers who were attempting to escape they were put to death but the sons of Ancus who were the instigators found safety by flight  Thus fell Lucius Tarquinius surnamed Priscus to distinguish him from one of his successors of the same name aged fiftysix years of which he had reigned thirtyeight  CHAP VII From the death of Tarquinius Priscus to the death of Servius Tullius the sixth king of Rome U C  THE report of the murder of Tarquin filled  his subjects with complaint and indignation while the citizens ran from every quarter to the palace to learn the truth of the account or to take vengeance on the assassins In this tumult Tanaquil widow of the late king considering the danger she must incur in case the conspirators should succeed to the crown and desirous of having her soninlaw for his successor with great art dissembled her sorrow as well as the king's death She assured the people from one of the windows of the palace that he was not killed but stunned by the blow that he would shortly recover and that in the mean time he had deputed his power to Servius Tullius his soninlaw Servius accordingly as it had been agreed upon between them issued from the palace adorned with the ensigns of royalty and preceded by his lictors and went to dispatch some affairs that related to the public safety still pretending that he took all his instructions from the king This scene of dissimulation continued for some days till he had made his party good among the nobles when the death of Tarquin being publicly ascertained Servius came to the crown solely at the senate's appointment and without attempting to gain the suffrages of the people  Se  vius was the son of a bondwoman who had been taken at the sacking of a town belonging to the Latins and was born whilst his mother was a slave While yet an infant in his cradle a lambent flame  is said to have played round his head which Tanaquil converted into an omen of his future greatness  Upon being acknowledged as king the chief object of his reign was to increase the power of the senate by depressing that of the people The populace who were unable to see into his designs conferred upon him a full power of settling the taxes as he should think proper And accordingly as he insisted that they should pay their taxes by centuries he commanded that they should give their votes in all public transactions by centuries also In former deliberations each citizen gave his suffrage singly and the numbers of the poor always carried it against the power of the rich but by the regulations of Servius the senate was made to consist of a greater number of centuries than all the other classes put together and thus entirely outweighed them in every contention  In order to ascertain the encrease or decay of his subjects and their fortunes he instituted another regulation which he called a lustrum By this all the citizens were to assemble in the Campus Martius in complete armour and in their respective classes once in five years and there to give an exact account of their families and fortune  Having thus enjoyed a long reign spent in settling the domestic policy of the state and also not inat+tentive to foreign concerns he conceived reasonable hopes of concluding it with tranquility and ease He had even thoughts of laying down his power and having formed the kingdom into a republic to retire into obscurity but so generous a design was frustrated ere it could be put into execution  In the beginning of his reign to secure his throne by every precaution he had married his two daughters to the two grandsons of Tarquin and as he knew that the women were of opposite dispositions as well as their intended husb  nds be resolved to cross their tempers by giving them to him of a contrary  turn of temper her that was meek and gentle to him that was bold and furious her that was ungovernable and proud to him that was remarkable for a contrary character by this he supposed that each would correct the failings of the other and that the mixture would be productive only of concord The event however proved otherwise Lucius his haughty son inlaw soon grew displeased with the meekness of his consort and placed his whole affections upon Tullia his brother's wife who answered his passion with sympathetic ardour As their wishes were ungovernable they soon resolved to break through every restraint that offered to prevent their union both undertook to murder their consorts which they effected and were accordingly soon after married together A first crime ever produces a second from the destruction of their consorts they proceeded to conspiring that of the king They began by raising factions againct him alledging his illegal title to the crown and Lucius by claiming it as his own as heir to Tarquin At length when he found the senate ripe for seconding his views he entered the senatehouse adorned with all the ensigns of royalty and placing himself upon the throne began to harangue them upon the obscurity of the king's birth and the injustice of his title While he was yet speaking Servius entered attended by a few followers and seeing his throne thus rudely invaded offered to push the usurper from his seat but Tarquin being in the vigour of youth threw the old man down the steps which led to the throne and some of his adherents being instructed for that purpose followed the king as he was feebly attempting to get to the palace and dispatched him by the way throwing his body all mangled and bleeding as a public spectacle into the street In the mean time Tullia burning with impatience for the event was  informed of what her husband had done and resolving to be among the first who should salute him as monarch ordered her chariot to the senatehouse But as her charioteer approached the place where the old king her father's body lay exposed and bloody the man all amazed at the inhuman spectacle and not willing to trample upon it with his horses offered to turn another way this only served to encrease the fierceness of her anger she threw the footstool at his head and ordered him to drive over the dead body without hesitation  This was the end of Servius Tullius a prince of eminent justice and moderation after an useful and prosperous reign of fortyfour years  CHAP VIII From the death of Servius Tullius to the banishment of Tarquinius Superbus the seventh and last king of Rome U C  LUCIUS Tarquinius afterwards called Superbus or the Proud having placed himself upon the throne in consequence of this violent attempt was resolved to support his dignity with the same violence with which it was acquired Regardless of the senate or the people's approbation he seemed to claim the crown by an hereditary right and refused the late king's body burial under pretence of his being an usurper All the good part of mankind however looked upon his accession with detestation and horror and this act of inefficient cruelty only served to confirm their hatred Conscious of this he ordered all such as be suspected to have been attached to Servius to be put to death and fearing the natural consequences of his tyranny he encreased the guard round his person  His chief policy seems to have been to keep the people always employed either in wars or public works by which means he diverted their attention from his unlawful method of coming to the crown He first marched against the Sabines who refused to pay him obedience and soon reduced them to submission He next began a war with the Volsci which continued for some ages after The city of the Gabii gave him much more trouble for having attempted with some loss to besiege it he was obliged to direct his efforts by stratagem contrary to the usual practice of the Romans He caused his son Sextus to counterfeit desertion upon pretence of barbarous usa  e and to seek refuge among the inhabitants of the place There by artful complaints and studied lamentations he so prevailed upon the pity of the people as to be chosen their governor and soon after general of their army At first in every engagement he appeared successful till at length finding himself entirely possessed of the confidence of the state he sent a trusty messenger to his father for instructions Parquin made no other answer than by taking the messenger into the garden where he cut down before him the tallest poppies Sextus readily understood the meaning of this reply and one by one found means to destroy or remove the principal men of the city still taking care to confiscate their effects among the people The charms of this dividend kept the giddy populace blind to their approaching ruin till they found themselves at last without counsellors or head and in the end fell under the power of Tarquin without even striking a blow After this he made a league with the Aequi and renewed that with the Etrurians  But while he was engaged in wars abroad he took care not to suffer the people to continue in idleness at home He undertook to build the capitol the foundation of which had been laid in a former reign  and an extraordinary event contributed to hasten the execution of his design A woman in strange attire made her appearance at Rome and came to the king offering to sell nine books which she said were of her own composing Not knowing the abilities of the seller or that she was in fact one of the celebrated sybils whose prophecies were never found to fail Tarquin refused to buy them Upon this she departed and burning three of her books returned again demanding the same price for the six remaining Being once more despised as an impostor she again departed and burning three more she returned with those remaining still asking the same price as at first Tarquin surprised at the inconsistency of her behaviour consulted the augurs to advise him what to do These much blamed him for not buying the nine and commanded him to buy the three remaining at whatsoever price they were to be had The woman says the historian after thus selling and delivering the three prophetic volumes and advising him to have a special attention to what they contained vanished from before him and was never seen after Upon this he chose proper persons to keep them who though but two at first were afterwards encreased to fifteen under the name of quindecemviri They were put into a stone chest and a vault in the newlydesigned building was thought the properest place to lodge them in safety The people having been now for four years together employed in building the capitol began at last to wish for something new to engage them wherefore Tarquin to satisfy their wishes proclaimed war against the Rutuli upon a frivolous pretence of their having entertained some malefactors whom he had banished and invested their chief city Ardea which lay about sixteen miles from Rome While the army was encamped before this place the king's son Sextus with Collatinus a noble Roman and  some others sat in a tent drinking together the discourse happening to turn upon the beauty and virtue of their wives each man praising his own Collatinus offered to decide the dispute by putting it to an immediate trial whose wife should be found possessed of the greatest beauty and most sedulously employed at that very hour Being heated with wine the proposal was relished by the whole company and taking horse without delay they posted to Rome tho' the night was already pretty far advanced There they found Lucretia the wife of Collatinus not like the other women of her age spending the time in ease and luxury but spinning in the midst of her maids and chearfully portioning out their tasks Her modest beauty and the easy reception she gave her husband and his friends so charmed them all that they unanimously gave her the preference and Sextus was so much inflamed that nothing but enjoyment could satisfy his passion  For that purpose he went from the camp to visit her privately a few days after and received the same kind reception which he had met with before As his intentions were not suspected Lucretia sate with him at supper and ordered a chamber to be got ready for him in the house Midnight was the time in which this ruffian thought it safest to put his designs in execution Having found means to convey himself into her chamber he approached her bedside with a drawn sword and rudely laying his hand upon her bosom threatened her with instant death if she offered to resist his passion Lucretia affrighted out of her sleep and seeing death so near was yet inexorable to his desire till being told that if she would not yield he would first kill her and then laying his own slave also lead by her side he would report that he had found and killed them both in the act of adultery The terror of infamy atchieved what that of death could not obtain she consented  to his desire and the next morning he returned to the camp exulting in his brutal victory In the mean time Lucretia detesting the light and resolving not to pardon herself for the crime of another sent for her husband Collatinus and for Spurius her father to come to her as an indelible disgrace had befallen the family These instantly obeyed the summons bringing with them Valerius a kinsman of her father's and Junius Brutus a reputed idiot whose father Tarquin had murthered and who had accidentally met the messenger by the way Their arrival only served to encrease Lucretia's poignant anguish they found her in a state of stedfast desperation and vainly attempted to give her relief  No said she never shall I find any thing worth living for in this life after having lost my honour You see my Collatinus a polluted wretch before you one whose person has been the spoil of another but whose affections were never estranged from you Sextus under the pretended veil of friendship has this night forced from me that treasure which death only can restore but if you have the hearts of men remember to avenge my cause and let posterity know that she who has lost her virtue hath only death for her best consolation  So saying she drew a poignard from beneath her robe▪ and instantly plunging it into her bosom expired without a groan The whole company remained for some time fixed in sorrow pity and indignation Spurius and Collatinus at length gave a vent to their grief in tears but Brutus drawing the poignard reeking from Lucretia's wound and lifting it up towards Heaven "Be witness ye Gods" he cried  that from this moment I proclaim myself the avenger of the chaste Lucretia's cause from this moment I profess myself the enemy of Tarquin and his lustful house from henceforth this life while life continues shall be employed in opposition to tyranny and for  the happiness and freedom of my much loved country  A new amazement seized the hearers to find him whom they had hitherto considered as an ideot now appearing in his real character the friend of justice and of Rome He told them that tears and lamentations were unmanly when vengeance called so loud and delivering the poignard to the rest imposed the same oath upon them which he himself had just taken  Junius Brutus was the son of Marcus Junius a noble Roman who was married to the daughter of Tarquinius Priscus and for that reason through a motive of jealousy was put to death by Tarquin the Proud This Junius Brutus had received an excellent education from his father and had from nature strong sense and an inflexible attachment to virtue but perceiving that Tarquin had privily murdered his father and his eldest brother he counterfeited himself a fool in order to escape the same danger and thence obtained the surname of Brutus Tarquin thinking his folly real despised the man and having possessed himself of his estate kept him as an ideot in his house merely with a view of making sport for his children  Brutus however only waited this opportunity to avenge the cause of his family Wherefore ordering Lucretia's dead body to be brought out to view and exposed in the public forum he enflamed the ardour of the citizens by a display of the horrid trans  tion He obtained a decree of the senate that Tarquin and his family should be for ever banished from Rome and that it should be capital for any to plead for or attempt his future return Thus this monarch who had now reigned twentyfive years being expelled his kingdom went to take refuge with his family at Cira a little city of Etruria In the mean time the Roman army made a truce with the  enemy and Brutus was proclaimed deliverer of the people  CHAP IX From the banishment of Tarquin to the appointment of the first dictator U C  THE regal power being overthrown a form of government nominally republican was substituted in its room The senate however reserved by far the greatest share of the authority to themselves and decorated their own body with all the spoils of deposed monarchy The centuries of the people chose from among the senators instead of a king two annual magistrates whom they called consuls with power equal to that of the regal and with the same privileges and the same ensigns of authority  Brutus the deliverer of his country and Collatinus the husband of Lucretia were chosen first consuls in Rome  But this new republic however which seemed so grateful to the people had like to have been destroyed in its very commencement A party was formed in Rome in favour of Tarquin Some young men of the principal families in the state who had been educated about the king and had shared in all the luxuries and pleasures of the court undertook to reestablish monarchy This party secretly encrease every day and what may create our surprize the sons of Brutus himself and the Aquilii the nephews of Collatinus were among the number Tarquin who was informed of these intrigues in his favour sent ambassadors from Etruria to Rome under a pretence of reclaiming the crown but in reality with a design to give spirit to his faction But the whole  conspiracy was discovered by a slave who had accidentally hid himself in the room where the conspirators used to assemble Few situations could have been more terribly affecting than that of Brutus a father placed as a judge upon the life and death of his own children impelled by justice to condemn and by nature to spare them The young men accused pleaded nothing for themselves but with conscious guilt awaited their sentence in silence and agony The other judges who were present felt all the pangs of nature Collatinus wept and Valerius could not repress his sentiments of pity Brutus alone seemed to have lost all the softness of humanity and with a stern countenance and a tone of voice that marked his gloomy resolution demanded of his sons if they could make any defence to the crimes with which they had been charged This demand he made three several times but receiving no answer he at length turned himself to the executioner "Now" cried he "it is your part to perform the rest" Thus saying he again resumed hi  s  at with an air of determined majesty nor  uld all the sentiments of paternal pity nor all the in p  ing looks of the people nor yet the compl  n  of the young men who were preparing for  alter the tenor of his resolution The ex  t  ners having stripped them naked and then w  ped them with rods presently after beheaded them Brutus all the time beholding the cruel spec  le with a steady look and unaltered countenance w  the multitude gazed on with all the sensations  pl  y te  o  and admiration  A  Tarquin's hopes of an insurrection in the city  vour being thus overthrown he was now re  d to force himself upon his former throne by so  n assistance and to that end prevailed upon the Vei  ns to assist him and with a considerable army advanced towards Rome  U C  The consuls were not remiss in preparations to oppose him Valerius commanded the foot and Brutus being appointed to head the cavalry went out to meet him on the Roman borders Aruns the son of Tarquin who commanded the cavalry for his father seeing Brutus at a distance was resolved by one great attempt to decide the fate of the day before the engaging of the armies wherefore spurring on his horse he made towards him with ungovernable fury Brutus who perceived his approach singled out from the ranks to meet him and both met with such rage that eager only to assail and thoughtless of defending they both fell dead upon the field together A bloody battle ensued with equal slaughter on both sides but the Romans remaining in possession of the field of battle claimed the victory in consequence Valerius returned in triumph to Rome  In the mean time Tarquin no way intimidated by his misfortunes prevailed upon Porsenna one of the kings of Etruria to espouse his cause and in person undertake his quarrel This prince equally noted for courage and conduct marched directly to Rome with a numerous army and laid siege to the city while the terror of his name and his arms filled all ranks of people with dismay The siege was carried on with vigour a furious attack was made upon the place the two consuls opposed in vain and were carried off wounded from the field while the Romans flying in great consternation were pursued by the enemy to the bridge over which both victors and vanquished were about to enter the city in the confusion All now appeared lost and over when Horatius Cocles who had been placed there as centinel to defend it opposed himself to the torrent of the enemy and assisted only by two more for some time sustained the whole fury of the assault till the bridge was broken down behind him when he  found the communication thus cut off plunging with his arms into the torrent of the Tyber he swam back victorious to his fellowsoldiers and was received with just applause  Still however Porsenna was determined upon taking the city and though five hundred of his men were slain in a sally of the Romans he reduced it to the greatest straights and turning the siege into a blockade resolved to take it by famine The distress of the besieged soon began to be insufferable and all things seemed to threaten a speedy surrender when another act of fierce bravery still superior to that which had saved the city before again procured its safety and freedom  Mutius a youth of undaunted courage was resolved to rid his country of an enemy that so sorely continued to oppress it and for this purpose disguised in the habit of an Etrurian peasant entered the camp of the enemy resolving to die or to kill the king With this resolution he made up to the place where Porsenna was paying his troops with a secretary by his side but mistaking the latter for the king he stabbed him to the heart and was immediately apprehended and brought back into the royal presence Upon Porsenna's demanding who he was and the cause of so heinous an action Mutius without reserve informed him of his country and his design and at the same time thrusting his right hand into a fire that was burning upon an altar before him "You see" cried he  how little I regard the severest punishment your cruelty can inflict upon me A Roman knows not only how to act but to suffer I am not the only person you have to fear three hundred Roman youth  ke me have conspired your destruction there  e prepare for their attempts  Porsenna a  at to much intrepidity had too noble a mind  knowledge merit though found in an enemy  he therefore ordered him to be safely conducted back to Rome and offered the besieged conditions of peace These were readily accepted on their side being neither h  d nor disgraceful except that twenty hostages were demanded ten young men and as many virgins of the be  t families in Rome But even in this instance also as if the gentler sex were resolved to be sharers in the desperate valour of the times Clelia one of the hostages escaping from her guards and pointing out the way to the rest of her female companions swam over the Tyber o  horseback amidst showers of darts from the enemy and presented herself to the consul This magistrate fearing the consequences of detaining her had her sent back upon which Porsenna not to be outdone in generosity not only gave her liberty but permitted her to chuse such of the hostages of the opposite sex as she should think fit to attend her On her part she with all the modesty of a Roman virgin chose only such as were under fourteen alledging that their tender age was least capable of sustaining the rigours of slavery  Tarquin by means of his son inlaw Manilius once more stirred up the Latins to espouse his interest and took the most conveniant opportunity when the plebeians were at variance with the senators concerning the payment of their debts These refused to go to war unless their debts were remitted upon their return so that the consuls finding their authority insufficient offered the people to elect a temporary magistrate who should have absolute power not only over all ranks of state but even over the laws themselves To this the plebeians reader cons  nts willing to give up their own power for  e  of abridging that of t  e  r  periors In consequence of th  s I  giv  the first Dictator of Rome for so  of  ce called being nominated to it by his colleague in the consu  sh    Thus the people who could not bear to hear the name of king even mentioned readily submitted to a magistrate possessed of much greater power so much do the names of things mislead us and so little is any form of government irksome to people when it concides with their prejudices  CHAP X From the creation of the first dictator to the election of the tribunes of the people UC  LARGIUS being now created dictator entered upon his office surrounded with his lictors and all the ensigns of ancient royalty and seated upon a throne in the midst of the people ordered the l  vi  s to be made in the manner of the kings of Rome The populace looked with terror upon a magistrate whom they had invested with uncontroulable power and peaceably went each to range himself under his respective standard Thus going forth to oppose the enemy he returned with his army and before his six months were exp  red laid down the dictatorship with the rep  tation of having exercised it with blameless lenity  But though for this time the people submitted to be led forth yet they were resolved at last to f  ee themselves from the yoke of their severe masters any though they could not get their complaints re  ss  yet they determined to fly from those whom they could not move to compassion The complaints t  of  e continuing they resolved to quit a city  ga  e them no shelter and to form a new esta  s  ment without its limits They therefore un  the conduct of a plebeian named Sicinius Bellu  ▪  e  red to a mountain from thence called the  on the banks of the river Anio within a  inte  miles f  om Home  the news of this defection the city was  with tumult and consternation those who  wished well to the army made all the attempts they could to scale the walls in order to join it The senate was not less agitated than the rest some were for violent measures and repelling force by force others were of opinion that gentler arts were to be used and that even a victory over such enemies would be worse than a defeat At length therefore it was resolved to send a messenger entreating the army to return home and declare their grievances promising at the same time an oblivion of all that had passed  This message not succeeding Menenius Agrippa one of the wisest and best of the senators was of opinion that the people were to be complied with  It was resolved therefore to enter into a treaty with the people and to make them such offers as should induce them to return Ten commissioners were accordingly deputed at the head of whom were Largius and Valerius who had been dictators and Menenius Agrippa equally loved by the senate and the people The dignity and the popularity of these ambassadors procured them a very respectable reception among the soldiers and a long conference began between them Largius and Valerius employed all their oratory on the one hand while Sicinius and Lucius Junius who were the spokesmen of the soldiery aggravated their distresses with all that masculine eloquence which is the child of nature The conference had now continued for a long time when Menenius Agrippa who had been originally a plebeian himself a shrewd man and who consequently knew what kind of eloquence was most likely to please the people addressed them with that celebrated fable which is so finely told us by Livy "In times of old when every part of the body could think for itself and each had a separate will of its own they all with common consent resolved to revolt against the belly they knew no reason they said why they should toil from morning till night in  its service while the belly in the mean time lay at its ease in the midst of them all and indolently grew fat upon their labours accordingly one and all they agreed to befriend it no more The feet vowed they would carry it no longer the hands vowed they would feed it no longer and the teeth averred they would not chew a morsel of meat though it were placed between them Thus resolved they all for some time shewed their spirit and kept their word but soon they found that instead of mortifying the belly by these means they only undid themselves they languished for a while and perceived when too late that it was owing to the belly that they had strength to work or courage to mutiny"  This fable the application of which is obvious had an instantaneous effect upon the people They unanimously cried out that Agrippa should lead them back to Rome and were making preparations to follow him when Lucius Junius beforementioned withheld them alledging that though they were gratefully to acknowledge the kind offers of the senate yet they had no safeguard for the future against their resentment that therefore it was necessary for the security of the people to have certain officers created annually from among themselves who should have power to give such of them as should be injured redress and plead the cause of the community  The people who are ever of opinion with the last speaker highly applauded this proposal which yet the commissioners had not power to comply with they therefore sent to Rome to take the instructions of the senate who worried with divisions among themselves and harrassed by complaints from without were resolved to have peace at whatsoever price it should be obtained accordingly as if with one  ce they consented to the creation of their new  lvers who were called  Tribunes of the People  Appius alone protesting with vehemence against the measure  The tribunes of the people were at first five in number though afterwards their body was encreased by five more They were always annually elected by the people and almost always from their body They at first had their seats placed before the doors of the senatehouse and being called in they were to examine every decree annulling it by the word  veto I forbid it  or confirming it by signing the letter  T  which gave it its validity This new office being thus instituted Sicinius Bellutus Lucius Junius Caius Licinius Albinus and Icilius Ruga were the first tribunes chosen by the suffrages of the people The senate also made an edict confirming the abolition of debts and now all things being adjusted both on the one side and the other the people after having sacrificed to the Gods of the mountain returned back once more in triumph to Rome  CHAP XI From the creation of the tribunes to the appointment of the decemviri U C  DURING the late separation all tillage had been entirely neglected and a famine was the consequence the ensuing season The senate did all that lay in their power to remedy the distress but the people pinched with want and willing to throw the blame on any but themselves ascribed the whole of their distress to the avarice of the patricians who having purchased all the corn as was alledged intended to indemnify themselves for the abolition of debts by selling it out to great advantage But abundance soon after appeased them for a time A large fleet of ships laden with corn from Sicily a  great part of which was a present from Gelon the king of that country to the Romans and the rest purchased by the senate with the public money raised their spirits once more  But Coriolanus incurred their resentment by insisting that it should not be distributed till the grievances of the senate were removed For this the tribunes summoned him to a trial before the people  When the appointed day was come all persons were filled with the greatest expectations and a vast concourse from the adjacent country assembled and filled up the Forum Coriolanus upon this presented himself before the people with a degree of intrepidity that merited better fortune His graceful person his persuasive eloquence the cries of those whom he had saved from the enemy inclined the auditors to relent But being unable to answer what was alledged against him to the satisfaction of the people and utterly confounded with a new charge of having embezzled the plunder of Antium the tribunes immediately took the votes and Coriolanus was condemned to perpetual ex  le  This sentence against their bravest defender struck the whole body of the senate with sorrow consternation and regret Coriolanus alone in the midst of the tumult seemed an unconcerned spectator He returned home followed by the lamentations of hundreds of the most respectable senators and citizens of Rome to take a lasting leave of his wife his children and his mother Veturia Thus recommending his little children to their care and all to the care of Heaven he left the city without followers or fortune to take refuge with Tullus Attius a man of great power among the Volscians who took him under his protection and espoused his quarrel  The first thing to be done was to induce the Volsci to break the league which had been made with Rome and for this purpose Tullus sent many  of his citizens thither in order to see some games at that time celebrating but in the mean time gave the senate private information that the strangers had dangerous intentions of burning the city This had the desired effect the senate issued an order that all strangers whoever they were should depart from Rome before sunset This order Tullus represented to his countrymen as an infraction of the treaty and procured an embassy to Rome complaining of the breach and redemanding all the territories belonging to the Volscians of which they had been violently dispossessed declaring war in case of a refusal but this message was treated by the senate with contempt  War being thus declared on both sides Coriolanus and Tullus were made generals of the Volscians and accordingly invaded the Roman territories ravaging and laying waste all such lands as belonged to the plebeians but letting those of the senators remain untouched In the mean time the levies went on but slowly at Rome the two consuls who were reelected by the people seemed but little skilled in war and even feared to encounter a general whom they knew to be their superior in the field The allies also shewed their fears and slowly b  ought in their succours so that Coriolanus continued to take their towns one after the other Fortune followed him in every expedition and he was now so famous for his victories that the Volsci left their towns desenceless to follow him into the field The v  ry soldiers of his colleague's army came over to him and would acknowledge no other general Thus find  g himself unopposed in the field and at the head of  me us army he at length invested the city of Rome itself fully resolved to besiege it It was then that the senate and the people unanimously agreed to send deputies to him with proposals of restoration in cas  he should draw off his army Coriolanus received  their proposals at the head of his principal officers and with the sternness of a general that was to give the law refused their offers  Another embassy was now sent forth conjuring him not to exact from his native city aught but what became Romans to grant Coriolanus however naturally inflexible and severe still persisted in his former demands and granted them but three days in which to finish their deliberations In this exigence all that was left was another deputation still more solemn than either of the former composed of the pontiffs the priests and the augurs These cloathed in their habits of ceremony and with a grave and mournful deportment issued from the city and entered the camp of the conqueror but all in vain they found him severe and inflexible as before  When the people saw them return ineffectually they began to give up the commonwealth as lost Their temples were filled with old men with women and children who prostrate at their altars put up their ardent prayers for the preservation of their country Nothing was to be heard but anguish and lamentation nothing to be seen but scenes of affright and distress At length it was suggested to them that what could not be effected by the intercession of the senate or the adjuration of the priests might be brought about by the tears of his wife or the commands of his mother This deputation seemed to be relished by all and even the senate itself gave it the sanction of their authority Veturia the mother of Coriolanus at first made some hesitation to undertake so pious a work knowing the inflexible temper of her son and fearing only to shew his disobedience in a new point of light by rejecting the commands of a parent however she at last undertook the embassy and set forward from the city accompanied by many of the principal matrons of Rome with  Volumnia his wife and his two children Coriolanus who at a distance discovered this mournful train of females was resolved to give them a denial and called his officers round him to be witnesses of his resolution but when told that his mother and his wife were among the number he instantly came down from his tribunal to meet and embrace them At first the women's tears and embraces took away the power of words and the rough soldier himself hard as he was could not refrain from sharing in their distress Coriolanus now seemed much agitated by contending passions while his mother who saw him moved seconded her words by the most persuasive eloquence her tears his wife and children hung round him entreating for protection and pity while the fair train her companions added their lamentations and deplored their own and their country's distress Coriolanus for a moment was silent feeling the strong conflict between honour and inclination at length as if rouzed from his dream he flew to take up his mother who had fallen at his feet crying out  O my mother thou hast saved Rome but lost thy son  He accordingly gave orders to draw off the army pretending to the officers that the city was too strong to be taken Tullus who had long envied his glory was not remiss in aggravating the lenity of his conduct to his countrymen Upon their return Coriolanus was slain in an insurrection of the people and afterwards honourably buried with late and ineffectual repentance  Great and many were the public rejoicings at Rome upon the retreat of the Volscian army but they were clouded soon after by the intrigues of Spurius Cassius who wanting to make himself despotic by means of the people was found guilty of a number of crimes all tending towards altering the constitution and was thrown headlong from the Tarpeian  rock by those very people whose interests he had endeavoured to extend  The year following the two consuls of the former year Manlius and Fabius were cited by the tribunes to appear before the people The Agrarian law which had been proposed some time before for equally dividing the lands of the commonwealth among the people was the object invariably pursued and they were accused of having made unjustifiable delays in putting it off  It seems the Agrarian law was a grant the senate could not think of giving up to the people The consuls therefore made many delays and excuses till at length they were once more obliged to have recourse to a dictator and they fixed upon Quintus Cincinnatus a man who had for some time given up all views of ambition and retired to his little farm where the deputies of the senate found him holding the plow and dressed in the mean attire of a labouring husbandman He appeared but little elevated with the addresses of ceremony and the pompous habits they brought him and upon declaring to him the senate's pleasure he testified rather a concern that his aid should be wanted he naturally preferred the charms of a country retirement to the fatiguing splendors of office and only said to his wife as they were leading him away  I fear my Attillia that for this year our little fields must remain unsown  Thus taking a tender leave he departed for the city where both parties were strongly enflamed against each other However he was resolved to side with neither but by a strict attention to the interests of his country instead of gaining the confidence of faction to seize the esteem of all Thus by threats and welltimed submission he prevailed upon the tribunes to put off their law for a time and carried himself so as to be a terror to the multitude whenever they refused to enlist and  their greatest encourager whenever their submission deserved it Thus having restored that tranquility to the people which he so much loved himself he again gave up the splendors of ambition to enjoy it with a greater relish in his little farm  U C  Cincinnatus was not long retired from his office when a fresh exigence of the state once more required his assistance the Aequi and the Volsci who though still worsted still were for renewing the war made new inroads into the territories of Rome Minutius one of the consuls who succeeded Cincinnatus was sent to oppose them but being naturally timid and rather more afraid or being conquered than desirous of victory his army was driven into a defile between two mountains from which except through the enemy there was no egress This however the Aequi had the precaution to fortify by which the Roman army was so hemmed in on every side that nothing remained but submission to the enemy famine or immediate death Some knights who found means of getting away privately through the enemy's camp were the first that brought the account of this disaster to Rome Nothing could exceed the consternation of all ranks of people when informed of it the senate at first thought of the other consul but not having sufficient experience of his abilities they unanimously turned their eyes upon Cincinnatus and resolved to make him dictator Cincinnatus the only person on whom Rome could now place her whole dependence was found as before by the messengers of the senate labouring in his little field with chearful industry He was at first astonished at the ensigns of unbounded power with which the deputies came to invest him but still more at the approach of the principal of the senate who came out to meet him A dignity so unlooked for however had no effect upon the simplicity or the integrity of his manners  and being now possessed of absolute power and called upon to nominate his master of the horse he chose a poor man named Tarquitius one who like himself despised riches when they led to dishonour Thus the saving a great nation was devolved upon an husbandman taken from the plough and an obscure centinel found among the dregs of the army Upon entering the city the dictator put on a serene look and entreated all those who were able to bear arms to repair before sunset to the Campus Martius the place where the levies were made with necessary arms and provisions for five days He put himself at the head of these and marching all night with great expedition he arrived before day within sight of the enemy Upon his approach he ordered his soldiers to raise a loud shout to apprize the consul's army of the relief that was at hand The Aequi were not a little amazed when they saw themselves between two enemies but still more when they perceived Cincinnatus making the strongest entrenchments beyond them to prevent their escape and enclosing them as they had enclosed the consul To prevent this a furious combat ensued but the Aequi being attacked on both sides and unable to resist or fly begged a cessation of arms They offered the dictator his own terms he take them their lives but obliged them in token of servitude to pass under the yoke which was two spears set upright and another across in the form of  callows beneath which the vanquished were to march Their captains and generals he made prisoners of war being reserved to adorn his triumph As for the plunder of the enemies camp that he has entirely up to his own soldiers without reserving any part for himself or permitting those of the deli  ered army to have a share Thus having rescued  Roman army from inevitable destruction having  stated a powerful enemy having taken and fortified  their city and still more having refused an  part of the spoil he resigned his dictatorship afte  having enjoyed it but fourteen days The senate would have enriched him but he declined thei  proffers chusing to retire once more to his farm and his cottage content with temperance and fame  But this repose from foreign invasion did not lesse  the tumults of the city within The clamours fo  the Agrarian law still continued and still mor  fiercely when Siccius Dentatus a plebeian advanced in years but of an admirable person and mi+litary deportment came forward to enumerate his hardships and his merits This old soldier made no scruple of extolling the various atchievements of hi  youth but indeed his merits supported ostentation▪ He had served his country in the wars forty years he had been an officer thirty first a centurion and then a tribune he had fought one hundred and twenty battles in which by the force of his single arm he had saved a multitude of lives he had gained fourteen civic three mural and eight golden crowns besides eightythree chains sixty bracelets eighteen gilt spears and twentythree horsetrappings whereof nine were for killing the enemy in single combat moreover he had received fortyfive wounds all before and none behind These were his honours yet notwithstanding all this he had never received any share of those lands which were won from the enemy but continued to draw on a life of poverty and contempt while others were possest of those very territories which his valour had won without any merit to deserve them or ever having contributed to the conquest A case of so much hardship had a strong effect upon the multitude they unanimously demanded that the law might be passed and that such merit should not go unrewarded It was in vain that some of the senators rose up to speak against it their voices were  drowned by the cries of the people When reason therefore could no longer be heard passion as usual succeeded and the young patricians running furiously into the throng broke the balloting urns and dispersed the multitude that offered to oppose them For this they were some time after fined by the tribunes but their resolution nevertheless for the present put off the Agrarian law  CHAP XII From the creation of the Decemviri to the extinction of that office U C  THE commonwealth of Rome had now for near sixty years been fluctuating between the contending orders that composed it till at length each side as if weary were willing to respire a while from the mutual exertions of their claims The citizens now therefore of every rank began to complain of the arbitrary decisions of their magistrates and wished to be guided by a written body of laws which being known might prevent wrongs as well as punish them In this both the senate and the people concurred as hoping that such laws would put an end to the commotions that so long had harrassed the state It was thereupon agreed that ambassadors should be sent to the Greek cities in Italy and to Athens to bring home such laws from thence as by experience had been found most equitable and useful For this purpose three senators Posthumius Sulpicius and Manlius were fixed upon and gallies ass  gned to convoy them agreeable to the majesty of the R  man people While they were upon this c  mmission abroad a dreadful plague depopulated the city at Rome and supplied the interval of their  o  n  with other anxiety than that of wishes for  their return In about a year the plague ceased an  the ambassadors returned bringing home a body o  laws collected from the most civilized states of Greece and Italy which being afterwards formed into ten tables and two more being added made that celebrated code called the laws of the Twelve Tables many fragments of which remain to this day  The ambassadors were no sooner returned than the tribunes required that a body of men should be chosen to digest their new laws into proper form and to give weight to the execution of them After long debates whether this choice should not be partly made from the people as well as the patricians it was at last agreed that ten of the principal senators should be elected whose power continuing for a year should be equal to that of kings and consuls and that without any appeal The persons chosen were Appius and Genutius who had been elected consuls for the ensuing year Posthumius Sulpicius and Manlius the three ambassadors Sextus and Romulus former consuls with Julius Veturius and Horatius senators of the first consideration Thus the whole constitution of the state at once took a new form and a dreadful experiment was going to be tried of governing one nation by laws formed from the manners and customs of another  The decemviri being now invested with absolute power agreed to take the reins of government by turns and that each should dispense justice for a day  These magistrates for the first year wrought with extreme application and their work being finished it was expected that they would be contented to give up their offices but having known the charms of power they were now unwilling to resign it they therefore pretended that some laws were yet wanting to complete their design and entreated the senate for a continuance of their offices to which that body assented  But they soon threw off the mask of moderation and regardless either of the approbation of the senate or the people resolved to continue themselves against all order in the decemvirate A conduct so notorious produced discontents and these were as sure to produce fresh acts of tyranny The city was become almost a desert with respect to all who had any thing to lose and the decemvirs rapacity was then only discontinued when they wanted fresh objects to exercise it upon In this state of slavery proscription and mutual distrust not one citizen was found to strike for his country's freedom these tyrants continued to rule without control being constantly guarded not with their lictors alone but a numerous c  owd of dependents clients and even patricians whom their vices had confederated round them  In this gloomy situation of the state the Aequi and Volsci those constant enemies of the Romans undertook their incursions resolved to profit by the intestine divisions of the people and advanced within about ten miles of Rome  But the decemviri being put in possession of all the military as well as of the civil power divided their army into three parts whereof one continued with Appius in the city to keep it in awe the other two were commanded by his colleagues and were led one against the Aequi and the other against the Sabines The Roman soldiers had now got into a method of punishing the generals whom they disliked by suffering themselves to be vanquished in the field They put it in practice upon this occasion and shamefully abandoned their camp upon the approach of the enemy Never was the news of a victory more joyfully received at Rome than the tidings of this defeat the generals as is always the case were blamed for the treachery of their men some demanded that they should be deposed others cried out for a dictator to lead the troops to conquest but among  the rest old Siccius Dentatus the tribune spoke his sentiments with his usual openness and treating the generals with contempt shewed all the faults of their discipline in the camp and their conduct in the field Appius in the mean time was not remiss in observing the disposition of the people Dentatus in particular was marked out for vengeance and under pretence of doing him particular honour he was appointed legate and put at the head of the supplies which were sent from Rome to reinforce the army The office of legate was held sacred among the Romans as in it were united the authority of a general with the reverence due to the priesthood Dentatus no way suspecting his design went to the camp with alacrity where he was received with all the external marks of respect But the generals soon found means of indulging their desire of revenge He was appointed at the head of an hundred men to go and examine a more commodious place for encampment as he had very candidly assured the commanders that their present situation was wrong The soldiers however who were given as his attendants were assassins wretches who had  ong been ministers of the vengeance of the decemviri and who now engaged to murder him though with all those apprehensions which his reputation as he was called the Ro+man Achilles might be supposed to inspire With these designs they led him fr  m the way into the below bosom of a retired mountain where they began to set upon him from behind Dentatus now too late perceived the treachery of the decemviri and was resolved to fell his life as dearly as he could he therefore put his back to a rock and defended himself against those who pressed most closely Though now grown old he had  i  l the remains of his former valour and killed no less than fifteen of the assailants and wounded thirty with his own hand The assassins now therefore terrified at his amazing  bravery showered in their javelins upon him at a distance all which he received in his shield with undaunted resolution The combat though so unequal in numbers was managed for some time with doubtful success till at length his assailants bethought themselves of ascending the rock against which he stood and thus poured down stones upon him from above This succeeded the old soldier fell beneath their united efforts after having shewn by his death that he owed it to his fortitude and not his fortune that he had come off so many times victorious The decemviri pretended to join in the general sorrow for so brave a man and decreed him a funeral with the first military honours but the greatness of their apparent distress compared with their known hatred only rendered them still more detestable to the people  But a transaction still more attrocious  han the former served to inspire the citizens with a resolution to break a  l measures of obedience and at last to restore freedom Appius who still remained at Rome fitting one day on his tribunal to dispense justice saw a maiden of exquisite beauty and aged about fifteen passing to one of the public schools attended by a matron her n  rse The charms of this damsel heightened by all the innocence of virgin modesty caught his attention and fired his heart The day following as she pa  t he found her still more beautiful than bef  re and his breast still more enflamed He now  e  e  re resolved to obtain the gratification of his passion  hatever should be the consequence and  nd means to inform himself of the virgin's name and family Her name was Virginia She was the daughter of Virginius a centurion then with the army in the field and had been contracted to Icilius for  erly a tribune of the people who had agreed to marry her at the end of the present campaign Appius at first resolved to break this match and to espouse  her himself but the laws of the Twelve Tables had forbidden the patricians to intermarry with the plebeians and he could not infringe these as he was the enactor of them Nothing therefore remained but a criminal enjoyment which as he was long used to the indulgence of his passions he resolved to obtain After having vainly tried to corrupt the fidelity of her nurse he had recourse to another expedient still more guilty He pitched upon one Claudius who had long been the minister of his pleasures to assert the beautiful maid was his slave and to refer the cause to his tribunal for decision Claudius behaved exactly according to his instructions for entering into the school where Virginia was playing among her female companions he seized upon her as his property and was going to drag her away by force but was prevented by the people drawn together by her cries At length after the first heat of opposition was over he led the weeping virgin to the tribunal of Appius and there plausibly exposed his pretensions He asserted that she was born in his house of a female slave who sold her to the wife of Virginius who had been barren That he had several credible evidences to prove the truth of what he said but that until they could come together it was but reasonable the slave should be delivered into his custody being her proper master Appius seemed to be struck with the justice of his claims he observed that if the reputed father himself were present he might indeed be willing to delay the delivery of the maiden for some time but that it was not lawful for him in the present case to detain her from her lawful master He therefore adjudged her to Claudius as his slave to be kept by him till Virginius should be able to prove his paternity This sentence was received with loud clamours and reproaches by the multitude the women in particular came round the innocent Virginia as  if willing to protect her from the judge's fury while Icilius her lover boldly opposed the decree and obliged Claudius to take refuge under the tribunal of the decemvir All things now threatened an open insurrection when Appius fearing the event thought proper to suspend his judgment till the arrival of Virginius who was then about a eleven miles from Rome with the army The day following was fixed for the trial and in the mean time Appius sent letters to the generals to confine Virginius as his arrival in town might only serve to kindle sedition among the people These letters however were intercepted by the centurion's friends who sent him  a  il and relation of the design laid against the li  y and the honour of his only daughter Virgi  upon this pretending the death of a near relation got permission to leave the camp and flew to Rome inspired with indignation and revenge Accordingly the next day he appeared before the tribun  to the astonishment of Appius leading his weeping daughter by the hand both habited in the deepe  t mourning Claudius the accuser was also there and began by making his demand Virginius next spoke in turn he represented that his wife had many children that she had been seen pregnant by numbers that if he had intentions of adopting a suppositious child he would have fixed upon a boy rather than a girl that it was notorious to all that  wife had herself suckled her own child and that it was surprizing such a claim should be now revived after a fifteen years discontinuance While the father spoke this with a stern air Virginia stood trembling by and with looks of persuasive innocence added weight to all his remonstrances The people seemed entirely satisfied of the hardship of his  ase till Appius fearing what he said might have dangerous effects upon the multitude interrupted him under a pretence of being sufficiently instructed in the  merits of the cause "Yes" says he  my conscience obliges me to declare that I myself am a witness to the truth of the deposition of Claudius Most of this assembly know that I was left guardian to this youth and I was very early apprized that he had a right to this young woman but the affairs of the public and the dissensions of the people then prevented my doing him justice However it is not now too late and by the power vested in me for the public good I adjudge Virginia to be the property of Claudius the plaintiff Go therefore lictors disperse the multitude and make room for a master to repossess himself of his slave  The lictors in obedience to his command soon drove off the throng that pressed round the tribunal and now they seized upon Virginia and were delivering her up into the hands of Claudius when Virginius who found that all was over seemed to acquiesce in the sentence He therefore mildly entreated Appius to be permitted to take a last farewell of one whom he had long considered as his child and so satisfied he would return to his duty with fresh alacrity With this the decemvir complied but upon condition that their endearments should pass in his presence Virginius with the most poignant anguish took his almost expiring daughter in his arms for a while supported her head upon his breast and wiped away the tears that rolled down her lovely visage and happening to be near the shops that surrounded the Forum he snatched up a knife that lay on the shambles and addressing his daughter "My dearest lost child" cried he  this this alone can preserve your honour and your freedom  So saying he buried the weapon in he  breast and then holding it up reeking with th  blood of his daughter "Appius" he cried  by this blood of innocence I devote thy head to th  infernal gods  Thus saying with the blood  knife in his hand and threatening destruction to whomsoever should oppose him he ran through the city wildly calling upon the people to strike for freedom and from thence went to the camp in order to spread a like flame through the army  He no sooner arrived at the camp followed by a number of his friends but he informed the army of all that was done still holding the bloody knife in his hand He asked their pardon and the pardon of the gods for having committed so rash an action but ascribed it all to the dreadful necessity of the times The army already predisposed immediately with shouts echoed their approbation and decamping left their generals behind to take their station once more upon mount Aventine whither they had retired about forty years before The other army which had been to oppose the Sabines seemed to feel a like resentment and came over in large parties to join them  Appius in the mean time did all he could to quell the disturbances in the city but finding the tumult incapable of controul and perceiving that his mortal enemies Valerius and Horatius were the most active in opposition at first attempted to find safety by slight nevertheless being encour  ed by Oppius who was one of his colleagues he ventured to assemble the senate and urged the punishment of all deserters The senate however were far from giving him the relief he sought for they foresaw the dangers and miseries that threatened the state in case of opposing the incensed army they therefore dispatched messengers to them offering to restore their former mode of government To this proposal all the people joyfully assented and the army gladly obeying now returned to the city if not with the ensigns at least with the pleasure of a triumphant entry Appius and Oppius one of his colleagues both died by their own hands in prison  The other eight decemvirs went into voluntary exile and Claudius the pretended master of Virginia was driven out after them  In the mean time these intestine tumults produced weakness within the state and confidence in the enemy abroad The wars with the Aequi and Volsci still continued and as each year some trifling advantages were obtained over the Romans they at last advanced so far as to make their incursions to the very walls of Rome  U C  But no  the courage only of the Romans seemed diminished by these contests but their other virtues also particularly their justice About this time the inhabitants of two neighbouring cities Ardea an  Aricia had a contest between themselves about som  lands that had long been claimed by both A  length being unable to agree they referred it to th  senate and the people of Rome The senate had ye  some o  the principles of primitive justice remaining and refused to determine the dispute But the peo+ple readily undertook the decision and one Scapti+us an old man declaring that these very lands o  right belonged to Rome they immediately vote themse  ves to be the legal possessors and sent hom  the former litigants thoroughly convinced of thei  own folly and of the Roman injustice  The tribunes now grew more turbulent they pro+posed two laws one to permit plebeians to intermar+ry with patricians and the other to permit them t  be admitted to the consulship also The senators re+ceived these proposals with indignation and seeme  resolved to undergo the utmost extremities rathe  than submit to enact them However finding the resistance only encrease the commotions of the state they at last consented to pass the law concernin  marriages hoping that this concession would satisf  the people But they were to be appeased but for  very short times for returning to their old custom  refusing to enlist upon the approach of an enemy the consuls were forced to hold a private conference with the chief of the senate where after many debates Claudius proposed an expedient as the most probable means of satisfying the people in the present conjuncture This was to create six or eight governors in the room of consuls whereof one half at least should be patricians This project which was in fact granting what the people demanded pleased the whole meeting and it was agreed that at the next public meeting of the senate the consuls should contrary to their usual custom begin by asking the opinion of the youngest senator Upon assembling the senate one of the tribunes accused them of holding secret meetings and managing dangerous designs against the people The consuls on the other hand averred their innocence and to demonstrate their sincerity gave any of the younger members of the house leave to propound their opinions These remaining silent such of the older senators as were known to be popular began by observing that the people ought to be indulged in their request that none so well deserved power as those who were most instrumental in gaining it and that the city could not be free until all were reduced to perfect equality Claudius spoke next and broke out into bitter invectives against the people asserting that it was his opinion that the law should not pass This produced some disturbance among the plebeians at length Genutius proposed as had been preconcerted that six governors should be annually chosen with consular authority three from the senate and three from the people and that when the time of their magistracy should be expired then it would be seen whether they would have the same office continued or whether the consulship should be established upon its former  ooting This project was eagerly embraced by the people yet so sickle were the multitude that  though many of the plebeians stood the choice wholly fell upon the patricians who offered themselves as candidates  U C  These new magistrates were called Military Tribunes they were at first but three afterwards they were encreased to four and at length to six They had the power and ensigns of consuls yet that power being divided among a number each singly was of less authority The first that were chosen only continued in office about three months the augurs having found something amiss in the ceremonies of their election  The military tribunes being deposed the consuls once more came into office and in order to lighten the weight of business which they were obliged to sustain a new office was erected namely that of Censors to be chosen every fifth year Their business was to take an estimate of the number and estates of the people and to distribute them into their proper classes to inspect into the lives and manners of their fellowcitizens to degrade senators for misconduct to dismount knights and to turn down plebeians from their tribes into an inferior in case of misdemeanor The two first censors were Papirius and Sempronius both patricians and from this order they continued to be elected for near an hundred years  This new creation served to restore peace for some time among the orders and a triumph gained over the Volscians by Geganius the consul added to the universal satisfaction that reigned among the people  This calm however was but of short continuance  U C  for some time after a famine pressing hard upon the poor the usual complaints against the rich were renewed and these as before proving ineffectual produced new seditions The consuls were accused of neglect in not having laid in proper quantities of corn they however disregarded the murmurs of the populace content with  exerting all their care in attempts to supply the pressing necessities But though they did all that could be expected from active magistrates in providing and distributing provisions to the poor yet Spurius Maelius a rich knight who had purchased up all the corn of Tuscany by far outshone them in liberality This demagogue enflamed with a secret desire of becoming powerful by the contentions in the state distributed corn in great quantities among the poorer sort each day till his house became the asylum of all such as wished to exchange a life of labour for one of lazy dependence When he had thus gained a sufficient number of partizans he procured large quantities of arms to be brought into his house by night and formed a conspiracy by which he was to obtain the command while some of the tribunes whom he had found means to corrupt were to act under him in seizing upon the liberties of his country Minucius soon discovered the plot and informing the senate thereof they immediately formed a resolution of creating a dictator who should have the power of quelling the conspiracy without appealing to the people Cincinnatus who was now eighty years old was chosen once more to rescue his country from impending danger He began by summoning Maelius to appear who refused to obey He next sent Ahala the master of his horse to force him who meeting him in the Forum and pressing Maelius to follow him to the dictator's tribunal upon his refusal Ahala killed him upon the spot The dictator applauded the resolution of his officer and commanded the conspirator's goods to be sold and his house to be demolished distributing his stores among the people  The tribunes of the people were much enraged at the death of Maelius and in order to punish the senate at the next election instead of consuls insisted  upon restoring their military tribunes With this  U C  the senate were obliged to comply The next year however the govern+ment returned to its ancient channel and consul were chosen  The Veians had long been the rivals of Rome▪ they had ever taken the opportunity of its internal distresses to ravage its territories and had even threatened its ambassadors sent to complain of these injuries with outrage It seemed now therefore determined that the city of Veii whatever it should cost was to fall and the Romans accordingly sate regularly down before it prepared for a long and painful resistance The strength of the place may be inferred from the continuance of the siege which lasted for ten years during which time the army continued encamped round it lying in winter under tents made of the skins of beasts and in summer driving on the operations of the attack Various was the success and many were the commanders that directed the siege sometimes all the besiegers works were destroyed and many of their men cut off by sallies from the town sometimes they were annoyed by an army of Veians who attempted to bring assistance from without A siege so bloody seemed to threaten depopulation to Rome itself by draining its forces continually away so that a law was obliged to be made for all the bachelors to marry the widows of the soldiers who were slain In order so carry it on with greater vigour Furius Camillus was created dictator and to him was entrusted the sole power of managing the long protracted war Camillus who without intrigue or any sollicitation had raised himself to the first eminence in the state had been made one of the censors some time before and was considered as the head of that office he was afterwards made a military tribune  and had in this post gained several advantages over the enemy It was his great courage and abilities in the above offices that made him thought most worthy to serve his country on this pressing occasion Upon his appointment numbers of the people flocked to his standard confident of success under so experienced a commander Conscious however that he was unable to take the city by storm he secretly wrought a mine into it with vast labour which opened into the midst of the citadel Certain thus of success and finding the city incapable of relief he sent to the senate desiring that all who chose to share in the plunder of Veii should immediately repair to the army Then giving his men directions how to enter at the breach the city was instantly filled with his legions to the amazement and consternation of the besieged who but a moment before had rested in perfect security Thus like a second Troy was the city of Veii taken after a ten years siege and with its spoils enriched the conquerors while Camillus himself transported with the honour of having subdued the rival of his native  triumphed after the manner of the kings of Rome having his chariot drawn by four milkwhite horses a distinction which did not fail to disgust the majority of the spectators as they considered those as sacred and more proper for doing honour to their g  i  then their generals  His usual good fortune attended Camillus in another expedition against the Falisci he routed their army and besieged their capital city Falerii which  reatened a long and vigorous resistance The re  uction of this little place would have been scarce w  rth mentioning in this scanty page were it not for an action of the Roman general that has done him more credit with posterity than all his other triumphs  ed A schoolmaster who had the care of the  ren belonging to the principal men in the city  having found means to decoy them into the Roman camp offered to put them into the hands of Camillus as the surest means of inducing the citizens to a speedy surrender The general was struck with the treachery of a wretch whose duty it was to protect innocence and not to betray it he for some time regarded the traitor with a stern air but at last finding words "Execrable villain" cried the noble Roman  offer thy abominable proposals to creatures like thyself and not to me what though we be the enemies of your city yet there are natural ties that bind all mankind which should never be broken there are duties required from us in war as well as in peace we fight not against an age of innocence but against men men who have used us ill indeed but yet whose crimes are virtues when compared to thine Against such base arts let it be my duty to use only Roman arts the arts of valour and of arms  So saying he immediately ordered him to be stript his hands tied behind him and in that ignominious manner to be whipped into the town by his own scholars This generous behaviour in Camillus effected more than his arms could do the magistrates of the town immediately submitted to the senate leaving to Camillus the conditions of their surrender who only fined them a sum of money to satisfy his army and received them under the protection and into the alliance of Rome  Notwithstanding the veneration which the virtues of Camillus had excited abroad they seemed but little adapted to bring over the respect of the turbulent tribunes at home as they raised some fresh accusation against him every day To the charge of being an opposer of their intended migration from Rome to Veii they added that of his having concealed a part of the plunder of that city particularly two brazen gates for his own use and appointed him a day on  which to appear before the people Camillus finding the multitude exasperated against him upon many accounts detesting their ingratitude resolved not to await the ignominy of a trial but embracing his wife and children prepared to depart from Rome He had already passed as far as one of the gates unattended on his way and unlamented There he could suppress his indignation no longer but turning his face to the Capitol and lifting up his hands to Heaven entreated all the Gods that his country might one day be sensible of their injustice and ingratitude and so saying he past forward to take refuge at Ardea a town at a little distance from Rome where he afterwards learned that he had been fined fifteen hundred asses by the tribunes at home  The tribunes were not a little pleased with their triumph over this great man but they soon had reason to repent their injustice and to wish for the assistance of one who alone was able to protect their country from ruin For now a more terrible and redoubtable enemy began to make its appearance than the Romans had ever yet encountered The Gauls a barbarous nation had about two centuries before made an irruption from beyond the Alps and settled in the northern parts of Italy They had been invited over by the deliciousness of the wines and the softness of the climate Wherever they came they dispossest the original inhabitants as they were men of superior courage extraordinary stature fierce in aspect barbarous in their manners and prone to emigration A body of these wild from their original habitations were now besieging Clusium a city of Etruria under the conduct of Brennus their king The inhabitants of Clusium frightened at their numbers and still more at their savage appearance entreated the assistance or at least the mediation of the Romans The senate who had long made it a maxim never to refuse succour to the  distressed were willing previously to send ambassadors to the Gauls to dissuade them from their enterprize and to shew the injustice of the irruption Accordingly three young senators were chosen out of the family of the Fabii to manage the commission who seemed more fitted for the field than the cabinet Brennus received them with a degree of complaisance that argued but little of the barbarian and desiring to know the business of their embassy was answered according to their instructions that it was not customary in Italy to make war but on just grounds of provocation and that they desired to know what offence the citizens of Clusium had given to the king of the Gauls To this Brennus sternly replied that the rights of valiant men lay in their swords that the Romans themselves had no right to the many cities they had conquered and that he had particular reasons of resentment against the people of Clusium as they refused to part with those lands which they had neither hands to till nor inhabitants to occupy The Roman ambassadors who were but little used to bear the language of a conqueror for a while dissembled their resentment at this haughty reply but upon entering the besieged city instead of acting as ambassadors and forgetful of their sacred characters headed the citizens in a sally against the besiegers In this combat Fabius Ambustus killed a Gaul with his own hand but was discovered while he was dispoiling him of his armour A conduct so unjust and unbecoming excited the resentment of Brennus who having made his complaint by an herald to the senate and finding no redress immediately broke up the siege and marched away with his conquering army directly to Rome  The countries through which the Gauls passed in their rapid progress gave up all hopes of safety upon their approach being terrified at their vast numbers the fierceness of their natures and their dreadful preparation  for war But the rage and impetuosity of this wild people were directed only against Rome They went on without doing the least injury in their march still breathing vengeance only against the Romans and a terrible engagement soon after ensued in which the Romans were defeated near the river Allia with the loss of near forty thousand men  Rome thus deprived of all succour prepared for every extremity The inhabitants endeavoured to hide themselves in some of the neighbouring towns or resolved to await the conqueror's fury and end their lives with the ruin of their native city But more particularly the ancient senators and priests struck with a religious enthusiasm on this occasion resolved to devote their lives to atone for the crimes of the people and habited in their robes of ceremony placed themselves in the Forum on their ivory chairs The Gauls in the mean time were giving a loose to their triumph in sharing and enjoying the plunder of the enemies camp Had they immediately marched to Rome upon gaining the victory the Capitol itself had been taken but they continued two days feasting upon the field of battle and with barbarous pleasure exulting amidst their slaughtered enemies On the third day after the victory the easiness of which much amazed the Gauls Brennus appeared with all his forces before the city He was at first much surprised to find the gates wide open to receive him and the walls defenceless so that he began to impute the unguarded situation of the place to a stratagem of the Romans After proper precaucautions he entered the city and marching into the Forum there beheld the ancient senators sitting in their order observing a profound silence unmoved and undaunted The splendid habits the majestic gravity and the venerable looks of these old men who had all in their time borne the highest offices of  the state awed the barbarous enemy into reverence▪ they took them to be the tutelar deities of the place and began to offer blind adoration till one more forward than the rest put forth his hand to stroak the beard of Papyruis an insult the noble Roman could not endure but lifting up his ivory scepter struck the savage to the ground This seemed as a signal for general slaughter Papyrius fell first and all the rest shared his fate without mercy or distinction Thus the fierce invaders pursued their slaughter for three days successively sparing neither sex nor age and then setting fire to the city burnt every house to the ground  UC  All the hopes of Rome were now placed in the Capitol every thing without that fortress was but an extensive scene of misery desolation and despair Brennus first summoned it with threats to surrender but in vain he then resolved to besiege it in form and hemmed it round with his army Nevertheless the Romans repelled his attempts with great bravery despair had supplied them with that perseverance and vigour which they seemed to want when in prosperity  In the mean white Brennus carried on the siege with extreme ardour He hoped in time to starve the garrison into a capitulation but they sensible of his intent although they were in actual want caus+ed several loaves to be thrown into his camp to convince him of the futility of such expectations His hopes sailing in this were soon after revived when some of his soldiers came to inform him that they had discovered some foot steps which led up to the rock and by which they supposed the Capitol might be surprised Accordingly a chosen body of his men were ordered by night upon this dangerous service which they with great labour and difficulty almost effected they were now got upon the very wall the Roman centinel was fast asleep their dogs  within gave no signal and all promised an instant victory when the garrison was awaked by the gabbling of some sacred geese that had been kept in the temple of Juno The besieged soon perceived the imminence of their danger and each snatched the weapon he could instantly find ran to oppose the assailants Manlius a patrician of acknowledged bravery was the first who exerted all his strength and inspired courage by his example He boldly mounted the rampart and at one effort threw two Gauls headlong down the precipice others soon came to his assistance and the walls were cleared of the enemy in a space of time shorter than that employed in the recital  From this time forward the hopes of the barbarians began to decline and Brennus wished for an opportunity of raising the siege with credit His soldiers had often conferences with the besieged while upon duty and the proposals for an accommodation were wished for by the common men before the chiefs thought of a congress At length the commanders on both sides came to an agreement that the Gauls should immediately quit the city and territories of Rome upon being paid a thousand pounds weight of gold This agreement being confirmed by oath on either side the gold was brought forth but upon weighing the Gauls attempted fraudulently to kick the beam of which the Romans complaining Brennus insultingly cast his sword and belt into the scale crying out that the only portion of the vanquished was to suffer By this reply the Romans saw that they were at the victor's mercy and knew it was in vain to expostulate against any conditions he should be pleased to impose But in this very juncture and while they were thus debating upon the payment it was told them that Camillus their old general was at the head of a large army hastening to their relief and entering  the gates of Rome Camillus actually appeared soon after and entering the place of controversy with the air of one who was resolved not to suffer imposition demanded the cause of the contest of which being informed he ordered the gold to be taken and carried back to the Capitol "For it has ever been" cried he  the manner with us Romans to ransom our country not with gold but with iron it is I only that am to make peace as being the dictator of Rome and my sword alone shall purchase it  Upon this a battle ensued in which the Gauls were entirely routed and such a slaughter followed that the Roman territories were soon cleared of their formidable invaders Thus was Rome by the bravery of Camillus cleared of its foes  The city being one continued heap of ruins except the Capitol and the greatest number of its former inhabitants having gone to take refuge in Veii the tribunes of the peop  e urged for the removal of the poor remains of Rome to Veii where they might have houses to shelter and walls to defend them On this occasion Camillus attempted to appease them with all the arts of persuasion observing that it was unworthy of them both as Romans and as men to desert the venerable seats of their ancestors where they had been encouraged by repeated marks of divine approbation to remove to and inhabit a city which they had conquered and which wanted even the good fortune of defending itself By these and such like remonstrances he prevailed upon the people to go contentedly to work and Rome soon began to rise from its ashes  We have already seen the bravery of Manlius in defending the Capitol and saving the last remains of Rome For this the people were by no means ungrateful having built him an house near the place where his valour was so conspicuous and having appointed him a public fund for his support But he  aspired at being not only equal to Camillus but to be sovereign of Rome With this view he laboured to ingratiate himself with the populace paid their debts and railed at the patricians whom he called their oppressors The senate was not ignorant of his discourses or his designs and created Cornelius Cossus dictator with a view to curb the ambition of Manlius The dictator soon finished an expedition against the Volscians by a victory and upon his return called Manlius to an account for his conduct Manlius however was too much the darling of the populace to be affected by the power of Cossus who was obliged to lay down his office and Manlius was carried from confinement in triumph through the city This success only served to enflame his ambition He now began to talk of a division of the lands among the people insinuated that there should be no distinctions in the state and to give weight to his discourses always appeared at the head of a large body of the dregs of the people whom his largesses had made his followers The city being thus filled with sedition and clamour the senate had recourse to another expedient and to oppose the power of Camillus to that of the demagogue Camillus accordingly being made one of the military tribunes appointed Manlius a day to answer for his life The place in which he was tried was near the Capitol where when he was accused of sedition and of aspiring at sovereignty he only turned his eyes and pointing thither put them in mind of what he had there done for his country The multitude whose compassion or whose justice seldom springs from rational motives refused to condemn him while he pleaded in sight of the Capitol but when he was brought from thence to the Peteline grove and where the Capitol was no longer to be seen they condemned him to be thrown headlong from the Tarpeian rock Thus the place which had been the  theatre of his glory became that of his punishment and infamy His house in which his conspiracies had been secretly carried on was ordered to be razed to the ground and his family were forbidden ever after to assume the name of Manlius  In this manner therefore the Romans went gradually forward with a mixture of turbulence and superstition within their walls and successful enterprizes without With what an implicit obedience they submitted to their pontiffs we have already seen in many instances and how far they might be impelled even to encounter death itself at their command will evidently appear from the behaviour of Curtius about this time  UC  who upon the opening of a gulph in the Forum which the augurs affirmed would never close up till the most precious things in Rome were thrown into it this heroic man leaped with his horse and armour boldly into the midst saying that nothing was more truly valuable than patriotism and military virtue The gulph say the historians closed immediately upon this and Curtius was never seen after  CHAP XIII From the wars of the Samnites and the wars with Pyrrhus to the beginning of the first Punic war when the Romans first went out of Italy  THE Romans having now triumphed over the Sabines the Etrurians the Latins the Hernici the Aequi and the Volscians began to look for greater conquests They accordingly turned their arms against the Samnites a people about an hundred miles east from the city descended from the Sabines and inhabiting a large tract of southern Italy which at this day makes a considerable part of the  kingdom of Naples Valerius Corvus and Cornelius were the two consuls to whose care it first sell to manage this dreadful contention between the rival states  Valerius was one of the greatest commanders of his time he was surnamed Corvus from a strange circumstance of being assisted by a crow in a single combat in which he fought and killed a Gaul of a gigantic stature To his colleague's care it was consigned to lead an army to Samnium the enemies capital while Corvus was sent to relieve Capua the capital of the Campanians Never was captain more fitted for command than he To an habit naturally robust and athletic he jointed the gentlest manners he was the fiercest and yet the most goodnatured man in the army and while the meanest centinel was his companion no man kept them more strictly to their duty but what completes his character he constantly endeavoured to preserve his dignities by the same arts by which he gained them Such soldiers as the Romans then were hardened by their late adversity and led on by such a general were unconquerable The Samnites were the bravest men they ever yet encountered and the contention between the two nations was managed on both sides with the most determined resolution But the fortune of Rome prevailed the Samnites at length fled averring that they were not able to withstand the fierce looks and the firedarting eyes of the Romans The other consul however was not at first so fortunate for having unwarily led his army into a de  he was in danger of being cut off had not Decius a tribune of the army possessed himself of an  which commanded the enemy so that the Samnites being attacked on either side were defeated with great slaughter not less than thirty thousand of them being left dead upon the field of battle  Sometime after this victory the soldiers who were  at Capua mutinying forced Quintius an  old and eminent soldier who was then residing in the country to be their leader and conducted by their rage more than their general came within eight miles of the city So terrible an enemy almost at the gates not a little alarmed the senate who immediately created Valerius Corvus dictator and sent him forth with another army to oppose them The two armies were now drawn up against each other while fathers and sons beheld themselves prepared to engage in opposite causes Any other general but Corvus would perhaps have brought this civil war to an extremity but he knowing his influence among the soldiery instead of going forward to meet the mutineers in an hostile manner went with the most cordial friendship to embrace and expostulate with his old acquaintances His conduct had the desired effect Quintius as their speaker only desired to have their defection from their duty forgiven and as for himself as he was innocent of their conspiracy he had no reason to sollicit pardon for his offences Thus this defection which at first threatened such dangers to Rome was repaired by the prudence and moderation of a general whose ambition it was to be gentle to his friends and formidable only to his enemies  A war between the Romans and the Latins follow+ed soon after but as their habits arms and language were the same the most exact discipline was necessary to prevent confusion in the engagement Orders therefore were issued by Manlius the consul that no soldier should leave his ranks upon whatever provocation and that he should be certainly put to death who should offer to do otherwise With these injunctions both armies were drawn out in array and ready to begin when Metius the general of the enemies cavalry pushed forward from his lines and challenged any knight in the Roman army to single combat For some time there was  general pause no soldier offering to disobey his orders till Titus Manlius the consul's own son burning with shame to see the whole body of the Romans intimidated boldly singled out against his adversary The soldiers on both sides for a while suspended the general engagement to be spectators of this fierce encounter The two champions drove their horses against each other with great violence Metius wounded his adversary's horse in the neck but Manlius with better fortune killed that of Metius The Latin being thus fallen to the ground for a while attempted to support himself upon his shield but the Roman followed his blows with so much force that he laid him dead as he was endeavouring to rise and then despoiling him of his armour returned in triumph to the consul his father's tent where he was preparing and giving orders relative to the engagement Howsoever he might have been applauded by his fellowsoldiers being as yet doubtful of the reception he should find from his father he came with hesitation to lay the enemy's spoils at his feet and with a modest air insinuated that what he did was entirely from a spirit of hereditary virtue But he was soon dreadfully made sensible of his error when his father turning away ordered him to be led publicly forth before the army There being brought forward the consul with a stern countenance and yet with tears spoke as follows  Titus Manlius as thou hast regarded neither the dignity of the consulship nor the commands of thy father as thou hast destroyed military discipline and set a pattern of disobedience by thy example thou has reduced me to the deplorable extremity of sacrificing my son or my country But let us not hesitate in this dreadful alternative a thousand lives were well lost in such a cause nor do I think that thou thyself wilt refuse to die when thy country is to reap the advantage of thy sufferings Go  lictor bind him and let his death be our future example  The whole army was struck with horror at this unnatural mandate fear for a while kept them in suspense but when they saw their young champion's head struck off and his blood streaming upon the ground they could no longer contain their execrations and their groans His dead body was carried forth without the camp and being adorned with the spoils of the vanquished enemy was buried with all the pomp of military distress  In the mean time the battle joined with mutual fury and as the two armies had often sought under the same leaders they combated with all the animosity of a civil war The Latins chiefly depended on their bodily strength the Romans on their invincible courage and conduct Forces so nearly matched seemed only to require the protection of their deities to turn the scale of victory and in fact the augurs had foretold that whatever part of the Roman army should be distrest the commander of that part should devote himself for his country and die as a sacrifice to the immortal gods Manlius commanded the right wing and Decius led on the left Both sides fought for some time with doubtful success as their courage was equal but after a time the left wing of the Roman army began to give ground It was then that Decius who commanded there resolved to devote himself for his country and to offer his own life as an atonement to save his army Thus determined he called out to Manlius with a loud voice and demanded his instructions as he was the chief pontiff how to devote himself and the form of the words he should use By his directions therefore being cloathed in a long robe his head covered and his arms stretched forward standing upon a javelin he devoted himself to the celestial and infernal gods for the safety of Rome Then arming himself and  mounting on horseback he drove furiously into the midst of the enemies carrying terror and consternation wherever he came till he fell covered with wounds In the mean time the Roman army considered his devouting himself in this manner as an assurance of success nor was the superstition of the Latins less powerfully influenced by his resolution a total rout began to ensue the Romans pressed them on every side and so great was the carnage that scarce a fourth part of the enemy survived the defeat This was the last battle of any consequence that the Latins had with the Romans they were forced to beg a peace upon hard conditions and two years after their strongest city Paedum being taken they were brought under an entire submission to the Roman power  UC  A signal disgrace which the Romans sustained about this time in their contest with the Samnites made a pause in their usual good fortune and turned the scale for a while in the enemies favour The senate having denied the Samnites peace Pontius their general was resolved to gain by stratagem what he had frequently lost by force Accordingly leading his army into a defile called Claudium and taking possession of all its outlets he sent ten of his soldiers habited like shepherds with directions to  ow themselves in the way the Romans were to march Exactly to his wishes the Roman consul met them and taking them for what they appeared  anded the route the Samnite army had taken they with seeming indifference replied that they were gone to Luceria a town in Apulia and were then actually besieging it The Roman general not suspecting the stratagem that was laid against him marched directly by the shortest road which lay through the defiles to relieve the city and was not undeceived till he saw his army surrounded and blocked up on every side Pontius thus having the  Romans entirely in his power first obliged the army to pass under the yoke having been previously stript of all but their garments he then stipulated that they should wholly quit the territories of the Samnites and that they should continued to live upon terms of former confederacy The Romans were constrained to submit to this ignominious treaty and marched into Capua disarmed halfnaked and burning with a desire of retrieving their lost honour When the army arrived at Rome the whole city was most surprisingly afflicted at their shameful return nothing but grief and resentment was to be seen and the whole city was put into mourning  But this was a transitory calamity the state had suffered a diminution of its glory but not of its power The war was carried on as usual for many years the power of the Samnites declining every day while that of the Romans gathered fresh confidence from every victory Under the conduct of Papyrius Cursor who was at different times consul and dictator repeated triumphs were gained Fabius Maximus also had his share in the glory of conquering them and Decius the son of that Decius whom we saw devoting himself for his country about forty years before followed the example of his noble father and rushing into the midst of the enemy saved the lives of his countrymen with the loss of his own  The Samnites being us driven to the most extreme distress as they were unable to defend themselves they were obliged to call in the assistance of a foreign power and have recourse to Pyrrhus king of Epirus to save them from impending ruin Pyrrhus a king of great courage ambition and power had always kept the example of Alexander his great predecessor before his eyes promised to come to their assistance and in the mean time dispatched over a body of three thousand men under the command  of Cineus an experienced soldier and a scholar of the great orator Demosthenes Nor did he himself remain long behind but soon after put to sea with three thousand horse twenty thousand foot and twenty elephants in which the commanders of that time began to place very great confidence However only a small part of these great preparations arrived in Italy with him for many of his ships were dispersed and some were totally lost in a tempest Upon his arrival at Tarentum his first care was to reform the people he came to succour for observing a  dissolution of manners in this luxurious city and that the inhabitants were rather occupied with the pleasures of bathing feasting and dancing than the care of preparing for war he gave orders to have all their places of public entertainment shut up and that they should be restrained in a  l such amusements as rendered soldiers unfit for battle In the  an time the Romans did til  that prudence could suggest to oppose so formidable an enemy and the  L  vinus was sent with a numerous army to  his progress Pyrrhus though his whole  was not yet arrived drew out to meet him  p  eviously sent an ambassador desiring to be  ermit  d to mediate between the Romans and the  ple of T  rentum To this Laevinus returned for  that he neither esteemed him as a mediator  him as an enemy and then leading the  bassador through the Roman camp desired him to  diligently what he saw and to report the re  to his master In consequence of this both  pproaching pitched their tents in sight of  upon the opposite banks of the river  Pyrrhus was always extremely careful in di  the situation of his own camp and in observing  of the enemy It was there that walking a  ng the banks of the river and surveying the Roman method of encamping he was heard to observe  That these barbarians seemed to be no way barbarous and he should too soon find their actions equal to their resolution  In the mean time ordering a body of men along the banks of the river be placed them in readiness to oppose the Romans in case they should attempt to ford it before his whole army was brought together Things turned out according to his expectations the consul with an impetuosity that marked his inexperience gave orders for passing the river where it was fordable and the advancedguard having attempted to oppose him in vain was obliged to retire to the main body of the army Pyrrhus being apprised of the enemies attempt at first hoped to cut off their cavalry before they could be reinforced by the foot that were not as yet got over and led on in person a chosen body of horse against them The Roman legions having with much difficulty advanced across the river the engagement became general the Greeks fought with a consciousness of their former fame and the Romans with a desire of gaining fresh glory mankind had never before seen two such differently disciplined armies opposed to each other nor is it to this day determined whether the Greek phalanx o  the Roman legion were preferable The combat was long in suspense the Romans had seven times repulsed the enemy and were as often driven back themselves but at length while the success seemed doubtful Pyrrhus sent his elephants into the midst of the engagement and these turned the scale of victory in his favour The Romans who had never before seen creatures of such magnitude were terrified not only with their intrepid fierceness but the castles that were built upon their backs filled with armed men It was then that Pyrrhus saw the day was his own and sending in his Thessalian cavalry to charge the enemy in disorder the rout became general A dreadful slaughter of the Romans ensued  fifteen thousand men being killed on the spot and eighteen hundred taken prisoners Nor were the conquerors in a much better state than the vanquished Pyrrhus himself being wounded and thirteen thousand of his forces slain Night coming on put an end to the slaughter on both sides and Pyrrhus was heard to cry out That one such victory more would ruin his whole army The next day as he walked to view the field of battle he could not help regarding with admiration the bodies of the Romans which were slain upon seeing them all with their wounds before their countenances even in death marked with noble resolution and a sternness that awed him into respect he was heard to cry out in the true spirit of a military adventurer  O with with what ease could I conquer the world had I the Romans for soldiers or had they me for their king  Pyrrhus after this victory was still unwilling to drive them to an extremity and considered that it was best treating with an humbled enemy he resolved therefore to send his friend Cineas the orator to negociate a peace of whom he often asserted that he had won more towns by the eloquence of Cineas  han by his own arms Cineas with all his art  ound the Romans incapable of being seduced either by bribery private or public persuasion  Being frustrated therefore in his expectations he  eturned to his master extolling both the virtues and  he grandeur of the Romans The senate he said  ppeared a reverend assembly of demigods and the  y a temple for their reception Of this Prryhus  oon after became sensible by an embassy from Rome concerning the ransom and exchange of prisoners At the head of this venerable deputation was Fabri  ius an ancient senator who had long been a pat  ern to his countrymen of the most extreme poverty  oined to the most chearful content Pyrrhus received  this celebrated old man with great kindness and willing to try how far fame had been just in his favour offered him rich presents which however the Roman refused The day after he was desirous of examining the equality of his temper and ordered one of his elephants to be placed behind the tapestry which upon a signal given raised its trunk above the ambassador's head at the same time using other arts to intimidate him But Fabricius with a countenance no way changing smiled upon the king observing that he looked with an equal eye on the terrors of this day as he had upon the allurement  of the preceding Pyrrhus pleased to find so much virtue in one he had considered as a barbarian wa  willing to grant him the only favour which he knew could make him happy he released the Roman prisoners entrusting them to Fabricius alone upo  his promise that in case the senate were determine  to continue the war he might reclaim them when ever he thought proper  U C  By this time the Roman army was reco+vered from its late defeat and Sulpicius an  Decius the consuls for the following yea  were placed at its head The panic which had for+merly seized it from the elephants now began a  wear off and both armies met near the city  sc  +lum both pretty nearly equal in numbers bein  about forty thousand strong and here again after long and obstinate fight the Grecian disciplin  prevailed The Romans being pressed on eve  s  de particularly by the elephants were obliged  retire to their camp leaving six thousand men dea  upon the field of battle But the enemy had no gre  reason to boast of their triumph as they had fo  thousand slain so that Pyrrbus replied to one of  soldiers who was congratulating him upon his vi  +tory  One such triumph more and I shall be u  +done  This battle finished the campaign the next season began with equal vigour on both sides Pyrrhus having received new succours from home While the two armies were approaching and yet but at a small distance from each other a letter was brought to old Fabricius the Roman general from the king's physician importing that for a proper reward he would take him off by poison and thus rid the Romans of a powerful enemy and a dangerous war Fabricius felt all the honest indignation at this base proposal that was consistent with his former character he communicated it to his colleague and instantly gave it as his opinion that Pyrrhus should be informed of the treachery that was plotted against him Accordingly letters were dispatched for that purpose informing Pyrrhus of the affair and alledging the unfortunate choice of his friends and enemies That he had trusted and promoted murderers while he carried his resentment against the generous and the brave Pyrrhus now began to find that th  se bold barbarians were by degrees schooled into refinement and would not suffer him to be their superior even in generosity he received the message with as much amazement at their candour as indignation at his physician's treachery  Admirable Fabricius  cried he  it would be as easy to turn the sun from its course as thee from the paths of honour  Then making the proper enquiry amongst his servants and having discovered the treason he ordered his physician to be executed However not to be outdone in magnanimity he immediately sent to Rome all his prisoners without ransom and again desired to negotiate a peace The Romans on the other hand refused him peace but upon the same conditions they had offered before  So that after an interval of two years Pyrrhus having encreased his army by new levies sent one  part of his army to oppose the march of Lentulus the Roman consul while he himself went to attack Curius Dentatus the other in command before his colleague could come up His principal aim was to suprise the enemy by night but unfortunately passing through woods and his lights failing him his men lost their way so that at the approach of morning he saw himself in sight of the Roman camp with the enemy drawn out ready to receive him The vanguard of both armies soon met in which the Romans had the advantage Soon after a general engagement ensuing Pyrrhus finding the balance of the victory turning still against him had once more recourse to his elephants These however the Romans were then too well acquainted with to feel any vain terrors from and having found that fire was the most effectual means to repel them they caused a number of balls to be made composed of flax and rosin which were thrown against them as they approached the ranks The elephants thus rendered furious by the flame and as boldly opposed by the soldiers could no longer be brought on but ran back upon their own army bearing down the ranks and filling all places with terror and confusion Thus victory at length declared in favour of Rome Pyrrhus in vain attempted to stop the flight and slaughter of his troops he lost not only twentythree thousand of his best soldiers but his camp was also taken This served as a new lesson to the Romans who were ever open to improvement they had formerly pitched their tents without order but by this new capture they were taught to measure out their ground and fortify the whole with a trench so that many of their succeeding victories are to be ascribed to their improved method of encamping  Pyrrhus thus finding all hopes fruitless he resolved to leave Italy where he found only desperate  enemies and faithless allies accordingly calling together the Tarentines he informed them that he had received assurances from Greece of speedy assistance and desiring them to wait the event with tranquillity the night following embarked his troops and returned undisturbed into his native kingdom with the remains of his shattered forces leaving a garrison in Tarentum merely to save appearances and in this manner ended the war with Pyr  hus after six years continuance  As for the poor luxurious Tarentines who were the original promoters of this war they soon began to find a worse enemy in the garrison that was left for their defence than in the Romans who attacked them from without The hatred between them and Milo who commanded their citadel for Pyrrhus was become so great that nothing but the fear of their old inveterate enemies the Romans could equal it In this distress they applied to the Carthaginians who with a large fleet came and blocked up the port of Tarentum so that this unfortunate people once famous through Italy for their refinements and pleasures now saw themselves contended for by three different armies without the choice of a conqueror At length however the Romans found means to bring over the garrison to their interest after which they easily became masters of the city and demolished its walls granting the inhabitants liberty and protection  CHAP XIV From the beginning of the first Punic war to the beginning of the second when the Romans began to grow powerful by sea U C  THE Romans having destroyed all rival pretensions at home began to pant after foreign conquests The Carthaginians were at that time in possession of the greatest part of Sicily and like the Romans only wanted an opportunity of embroiling the natives in order to become masters of the whole island This opportunity at length offered Hiero king of Syracuse one of the states of that island which was as yet unconquered entreated their aid against the Mamertines a little people of the same country and they sent him supplies both by sea and land The Mamertines on the other hand to shield off impending ruin put themselves under the protection of Rome The Romans not thinking the Mamer  worthy of the name of allies instead of pro  ding to assist them boldly declared war against Carthage alledging as a reason the assistance which Carthage had lately sent to the southern parts of Italy against the Romans In this manner a war was declared between these two powerful states both grown too great to continue patient spectators of each others encrease  Carthage a colony of the Phoenicians was built on the coast of Africa near the place where Tunis now stands about an hundred and thirtyseven years before the foundation of Rome As it had been long growing into power so it had extended its dominions all along the coasts But its chief strength lay in its fleets and commerce thus circumstanced  these two great powers began what is called the first Punic war The Carthaginians possessed of gold and silver which might be exhausted the Romans famous for perseverance patriotism and poverty which seemed to gather strength by every defeat  But there seemed to be an insurmountable obstacle to the ambitious views of Rome as they had no fleet or at least what deserved that title while the Carthaginians had the entire command at sea and kept all the maritime towns under obedience In such a situation any people but the Romans would have rested contented under disadvantages which nature seemed to have imposed but nothing could conqueror or intimidate them They began to apply themselves to maritime affairs and though without shipwrights to build or seamen to navigate a fleet they resolved to surmount every obstacle with inflexible perseverance A Carthaginian vessel happened to be in a storm driven ashore and this was sufficient to serve as a model The consul Duillius was the first who ventured to sea with his new constructed armament and though far inferior to the enemy in the management of his fleet yet he gained the first naval victory the Carthaginians losing fifty o  their ships and the undisturbed sovereignty of the sea which they valued more  But the conquest of Sicily was only to be obtaintained by humbling the power of Carthage at home For this reason the senate resolved to carry the war i  Africa itself and accordingly they sent Regulus and Manlius with a fleet a three hundred sail to make the invasion Regulus was reckoned the most consummate warrior that Rome could then produce and a professed example of frugal severity His patriotism was still greater than his temperance all the private passions seemed extinguished in him or they were all swallowed up in one great ruling affection  the love of his country The two generals set  a  with their fleet which was the greatest that had ever yet left an Italian port carrying an hundred and forty thousand men They were met by the Carthaginians with a fleet as powerful and men better used to the sea While the fight continued rather between the ships than the men at a distance the Carthaginians seemed successful but when the Romans came to grapple with them the difference between a mercenary army and one that fought for fame was apparent The resolution of the Romans was crowned with success the enemies fleet were dispersed and fiftyfour of their vessels taken The consequence of this victory was an immediate descent upon the coasts of Africa and the capture of the city Clupea together with twenty thousand men who were made prisoners of war  The senate being informed of these great successes and applied to for fresh instructions commanded Manlius back to Italy in order to superintend the Sicilian war and directed that Regulus should continue in Africa to prosecute his victories there  A battle ensued in which Carthage was once more defeated and some of its best troops were cut off This fresh victory contributed to throw them into the utmost despair more than eighty of their towns submitted to the Romans In this distress the Carthaginians destitute of generals at home were obliged to send to Lacedemon offering the command of their armies to Xantippus a general of great expe  ience who undertook to conduct them  This general began by giving the magistrates proper instructions for levying their men he assured them that their armies were hitherto overthrown not by the strength of the enemy but by the ignorance of their own generals he therefore only required a ready obedience to his orders and assured them of an easy victory The whole city seemed  once more revived from despondence by the exhortations of a single stranger and soon from hope grew into confidence This was the spirit the Grecian general wished to excite in them so that when he saw them thus ripe for the engagement he joyfully took the field The Lacedemonian made the most skilful disposition of his forces he placed his cavalry in the wings he disposed the elephants at proper intervals behind the line of the heavyarmed infantry and bringing up the lightarmed troops before he ordered them to retire through the line of infantry after they had discharged their weapons At length both armies engaging after a long and obstinate resistance the Romans were overthrown with dreadful slaughter the greatest part of their army being destroyed and Regulus himself taken prisoner Several other distresses of the Romans followed soon after this They lost their whole fleet in a storm and Agrigentum their principal town in Sicily was taken by Karthalo the Carthaginian general They undertook to build a new fleet which also shared the fate of the former the mariners as yet unacquainted with the Mediterranean shores drove it upon quicksands and soon after the greatest part perished in a storm  Mean time the Carthaginians being thus successful were desirous of a new treaty for peace hoping to have better terms than those insisted upon by Regulus For this purpose they supposed that he whom they had now for four years kept in a dungeon confined and chained would be a proper solicitor It was expected that being wearied with imprisonment and bondage he would gladly endeavour to p  de his countrymen to a discontinuance of the war  ich only prolonged his captivity He was accordingly sent with their ambassadors to Rome but with a  mise previously exacted from him to return  of being unsuccessful He was even  given to understand that his life depended upon the success of his negociation  When this old general together with the ambassadors of Carthage approached Rome numbers of his friends came out to meet and congratulate his return Their acclamations resounded through the city but Regulus refused with settled melancholy to enter the gates It was in vain that he was entreated on every side to visit once more his little dwelling and share in that joy which his return had inspired He persisted in saying that he was now but a slave belonging to the Carthaginians and unfit to partake in the liberal honours of his country The senate assembling without the walls as usual to give audience to the ambassadors Regulus opened his commission as he had been directed by the Carthaginian council and their ambassadors seconded his proposals The senate were by this time themselves weary of a war which had been protracted above eight years and were no way disinclinable to a peace It only remained for Regulus himself to give his opinion who when it came to his turn to speak to the surprize of all the world gave his voice for continuing the war So unexpected an advice not a little disturbed the senate they pitied as well as admired a man who had used such eloquence against his private interest and could  conclude upon a measure which was to terminate in his ruin But he soon relieved their embarrasment by breaking off the treaty and by rising in order to return to his bonds and confinement It was in vain that the senate and all his dearest friends entreated his stay he still repressed their solicitations Marcia his wife with her little children filled the city with her lamentations and vainly entreated to be permitted to see him he still obstinately persisted in keeping his promise and though sufficiently apprised of the tortures that awaited his return without embracing his  family or taking leave of his friends he departed with the ambassadors for Carthage  Nothing could equal the fury and the disappointment of the Carthaginians when they were informed by their ambassadors that Regulus instead of hastening a peace had given his opinion for continuing the war They accordingly prepared to punish his conduct with the most studied tortures First his eyelids were cut off and then he was remanded to prison He was after some days again brought out and exposed with his face opposite the burning sun At last when malice was fatigued with studying all the arts of torture he was put into a barrel stuck full of nails that pointed inwards and in this painful position he continued till he died  Both sides now took up arms with more than former animosity At length the Roman perseverance was crowned with success one victory followed on the back of another Fabius Buteo the consul once more shewed them the way to naval victory by defeating a large squadron of the enemies ships but Lutatius Catulus gained a victory still more complete in which the power of Carthage seemed totally destroyed at sea by the loss of an hundred and twenty ships according to the smallest computation This loss brought the Carthaginians to sue for peace which Rome thought proper to grant but still inflexible in its demands exacted the same conditions which Regulus had formerly offered at the gates of Carthage These were that they should lay down a thousand talents of silver to defray the charge of the war and should pay two thousand two hundred more in ten years time that they should quit Sicily with all such islands as they possessed near it that they should never make war against the allies of Rome or come with any vessels of war within the Roman dominions and lastly that all their prisoners and deserters should  be delivered up without ransom To these hard conditions  U C  the Carthaginians now exhausted readily subscribed and thus ended the first Punic war which had lasted twentyfour years and in some measure had drained both nations of every resource to begin another  CHAP XV From the end of the first Punic war to the end of the second  THE war being ended between the Carthaginians and Romans a profound peace ensued and in about six years after the temple of Janus was shut for the second time since the foundation of the city The Romans being thus in friendship with all nations had an opportunity of turning to the arts of peace they now began to have a relish for poetry the first liberal art which rises in every civilized nation and the first also that decays Hitherto they had been entertained only with the rude drolleries of their lowest buffoons they had sports called Fescennini in which a few debauched actors made their own parts while raillery and smut supplied the place of humour To these a composition of a higher kind succeeded which they called satire which was a kind of dramatic poem in which the characters of the great were particularly pointed out and made an object of derision to the vulgar After these came tragedy and comedy which were borrowed from the Greeks and indeed the first dramatic poet of Rome whose name was Livius Andronicus was by birth a Grecian  U C  The instant these finer kinds of composition appeared this great people rejected their former impurities with disdain From thenceforward they laboured upon the Grecian  model and though they were never able to rival their masters in dramatic composition they soon surpassed them in many of the more soothing kinds of poetry Elegiac pastoral and didactic compositions began to assume new beauties in the Roman language and satire not that rude kind of dialogue already mentioned but a nobler sort invented by Lucilius was all their own  While they were thus admitting the arts of peace they were not unmindful of making fresh preparations for war all intervals of ease seemed rather to give fresh vigour for new designs than to relax their former intrepidity The Illyrians were the first people upon whom they tried their strength after some continuance of peace That nation    which had long plundered the merchants of the Mediterranean with impunity happened to make depredations upon some of the trading subjects of Rome this being complained of to Teuta the queen of the country she instead of granting redress ordered the ambassador that was sent to demand restitution to be murdered A war ensued in which the Romans were victorious most of the Illyric towns were surrendered to the consuls and a peace at last concluded by which the greatest part of the country was ceded to Rome a yearly tribute was exacted for the rest and a prohibition added that the Illyrians should not sail beyond the river Lissus with more than two barks and those unarmed  The Gauls were the next people that incurred the displeasure of the Romans Supposing a time of peace when the armies were disbanded a proper season for new irruptions this barbarous people invited fresh forces from beyond the Alps and entering Etruria wasted all with fire and sword till they came within about three days journey of Rome A pr  etor and a consul were sent to oppose them who now instructed in the improved arts of war were  enabled to surround the Gauls who still retained their primaeval barbarity It was in vain that those hardy troops who had nothing but their courage to protect them formed two fronts to oppose their adversaries their naked bodies and undisciplined forces were unable to withstand the shock of an enemy completely armed and skilled in military evolutions A miserable slaughter ensued in which forty thousand were killed and ten thousand taken prisoners This victory was followed by another gained over them by Marcellus in which he killed Viridomarus their king with his own hand and gained the third royal spoils that were yet obtained at Rome These conquests forced them to beg a peace the conditions of which served greatly to enlarge the empire Thus the Romans went on with success they had now totally recovered their former losses and only wanted an enemy worthy of their arms to begin a new war  The Carthaginians had only made a peace because they were no longer able to continue the war They therefore took the earliest opportunity of breaking the treaty they besieged Saguntum a city of Spain which had been in alliance with Rome and though desired to desist prosecuted their operations with vigour Ambassadors were sent in consequence from Rome to Carthage complaining of the infraction of their articles and requiring that Hannibal the Carthaginian general who had advised this measure should be delivered up which being refused both sides prepared for a second Punic war  The Carthaginians trusted the management of it on their side to Hannibal the son of Amilcar This extraordinary man had been made the sworn foe of Rome almost from his infancy for while yet very young his father brought him before the altar and obliged him to take an oath that he never would be in friendship with the Romans nor desist from opposing  their power until he or they should be no more On his first appearance in the field he reconciled in his own person the most just method of commanding with the most perfect obedience to his superiors Thus he was equally beloved by his generals and the troops he was appointed to lead He was possessed of the greatest courage in opposing danger and the greatest presence of mind in retiring from it No fatigue was able to subdue his body nor any misfortune to break his spirit equally patient of heat and cold he only took sustenance to content nature and not to delight his appetite He was the best horseman and the swiftest runner of his time This great general who is considered as the most skilful of antiquity having overrun all Spain and levied a large army of various languages and nations be resolved to carry the war into Italy itself as the Romans had before carried it into the dominions of Carthage For this purpose leaving Hanno with a sufficient force to guard his conquests in Spain he crossed the Pyrenean mountains into Gaul with an army of fifty thousand foot and nine thousand horse He quickly traversed that country which was then wild and extensive and filled with nations that were his declared enemies In vain its forests and rivers appeared to intimidate him in vain the Rhone with its rapid current and its banks covered with enemies or the Dura branched out into numberless channels opposed his way he passed them all with perseverance and in ten days arrived at the foot of the Alps over which he was to explore a new passage into Italy It was in the midst of winter when this astonishing project was undertaken The season ended new horrors to a scene that nature had already crowded with objects of dismay The prodigious height and tremendous steepness of the mountains c  ped with snow the people barbarous and fierce dressed in skins with long and shaggy hair presented  a pictured that impressed the beholders with astonishment and terror But nothing was capable of subduing the courage of the Carthaginian general for at the end of fifteen days spent in crossing the Alps he found himself in the plains of Italy with about half his army remaining the rest having died of the cold or being cut off by the natives  As soon as it was known at Rome that Hannibal at the head of an immense army was crossing the Alps in order to invade their dominions the senate sent Scipo to oppose him who was obliged to retreat with considerable loss In the mean time Hannibal being thus victorious took the most prudent precautions to encrease his army giving orders always to spare the possessions of the Gauls while his depredations were permitted upon those of Rome and this so pleased that simple people that they declared for him in great numbers and flocked to his standard with alacrity  The second battle was fought upon the banks of the river Trebia The Carthaginian general being apprised of the Roman impetuosity of which he always availed himself in almost every engagement had sent off a body of a thousand horse each with a foot soldier behind across the river to ravage the enemies country and provoke them to engage The Romans quickly routed this force who seeming to be defeated took the river and were as eagerly pursued by Sempronius the consul It was not however till his army was got upon the opposite bank that he perceived himself half conquered already his men being fatigued with wading up to their armpits and quite benumbed by the intense coldness of the water A total rout ensued twentysix thousand of the Romans were either killed by the enemy or drowned in attempting to repass the river A body of ten thousand men were all that survived who finding themselves enclosed on every  side broke desperately through the enemies ranks and fought retreating till they sound shelter in the city of Placentia  The Third defeat the Romans sustained was at the lake of Thrasimene near to which was a chain of mountains and between these and the lake a narrow passage lending to a valley that was embosomed in hills It was upon these hills that Hannibal disposed his best troops and it was into this valley that Flaminius the Roman general led his men to attack him A disposition every way so favourable for the Carthaginians was also assisted by accident for a mist rising from the lake kept the Romans from seeing their enemies while the army upon the mountains being above its influence saw the whole disposition of their opponents The fortune of the day was such as might be expected from the conduct of the two generals the Roman army was broken and slaughtered almost before they could perceive the enemy that destroyed them About fifteen thousand Romans together with Flaminius himself fell in the valley and six thousand more were obliged to yield themselves prisoners of war  Upon the news of this defeat at Rome after the general consternation was allayed the senate upon mature deliberation resolved to elect a commander with absolute authority in whom they might repose their last and greatest expectations Their choice fell upon Fabius Maximus a man of great courage but with a happy mixture of caution He was apprised that the only way to humble the Carthaginians at such a distance from home was rather by harrassing them than by fighting For this purpose he always encamped upon the highest grounds inaccessible to the enemies cavalry Whenever they moved he moved watched their motions straightened their quarters and cut off their provisions  By these arts Fabius had actually at one time enclosed Hannibal among mountains where it was impossible to winter and yet from which it was almost impracticable to extricate his army without eminent danger In this exigence nothing but one of those stratagems of war which fall to the lot of great abilities only to invent could save him he ordered a number of small fagots and lighted torches to be tied to the horns of two thousand oxen that he had in his camp and that they should be driven towards the enemy These tossing their heads and running up the sides of the mountains seemed to fill the whole neighbouring forest with fire while the centinels that were placed to guard approaches of the mountain seeing such a number of flames advancing towards their posts sled in consternation supposing the whole body of the enemy was in arms to overwhelm them By this stratagem Hannibal drew off his army and escaped through the defiles that led beneath the hills though with considerable damage to his rear  Soon after Fabius was obliged to lay down his office his time being expired and Terentius Varro was chosen by the majority to succeed to the command This Terentius Varro was a man sprung from the dregs of the people with nothing but his confidence and riches to recommend him With him was joined Aemilius Paulus of a disposition entirely opposite experienced in the field cautious in action and impressed with a thorough contempt for the abilities of his plebeian colleague  The Romans finding themselves enabled to bring a competent force into the field being almost ninety thousand strong now again resolved to meet Hannibal who was at this time encamped near the village of Cannae with a wind that for a certain season blows still one way in his rear which raising great clouds  of dust from the parched plains behind he knew must greatly distress an approaching enemy In this situation he waited the coming up of the Romans with an army of forty thousand foot and half that number of cavalry The two consuls soon appeared to his wish dividing their forces into two parts and agreeing to take the command every day by turns On the first day of their arrival it falling to the lot of Aemilius to command he was entirely averse to engaging The next day however it being come to Varro's turn to command he without asking his colleague's concurrence gave the signal for battle and pa  ing the river Ausidus that lay between both armies put his forces in array The battle began with the lightarmed infantry the horse engaged s  n after and the Roman cavalry being unable to stand against those of Numidia the legions came up to reinforce them It was then that the confl  ct became general the Roman soldiers for a long time endeavoured but in vain to penetrate the centre where the Gauls and Spaniards fought which Hannibal observing ordered part of those troops to give  y and to permit the Romans to embosom themselves within a chosen body of his Africans whom he had placed on their wing so as to surround them upon that a terrible slaughter began to ensue of the Romans fatigued with repeated attacks from the Africans who were fresh and vigorous At last the  became general in every part of the Roman army the boastings of Varro were now no longer heard while Aemilius who had been terribly wounded by a slinger in the very beginning of the engagement still feebly led on his body of horse  nd did all that could be done to make head against  e enemy however being unable to sit on horseback he was forced to dismount It was in this deplorable condition of things that one Lentulus a t  bune of the army as he was flying on horseback  from the enemy which at some distance pursued him met Aemilius sitting upon a stone covered over with blood and wounds and waiting for the coming up of the pursuers▪ "Aemilius" cried the generous tribune  you at least are guiltless of this day's slaughter take my horse and fly  I thank thee Lentulus  cried the dying consul  all is over my part is chosen go I command thee and tell the senate from me to fortify Rome against the approach of the conqueror Tell Fabius also that Aemilius while living ever remembered his advice and now dying approves it  While he was yet speaking the enemy approached and Lentulus before he was out view saw the consul expire feebly fighting in the midst of hundreds In this battle the Romans lost fifty thousand men and so many knights that it is said Hannibal sent three bushels of go  rings to Carthage which those of this order had worn on their fingers  When the first consternation was abated after this dreadful blow at Rome the senate came to a general resolution to create a dictator in order to give strength to their government A short time after Varro arrived having left behind him the wretched remains of his army and as he had been the principal cause of the late calamity it was natural to suppose that the senate would severely reprimand the rashness of his conduct But far otherwise The Romans went out in multitudes to meet him and the senate returned him thanks that he had not despaired of the safety of Rome Fabius who was considered as the shield of Rome and Marcellus as the sword were appointed to lead the armies and though Hannibal once more offered them peace they refused it but upon condition that he should quit ItalyTerms similar to those they had formerly insisted upon from Pyrihus  In the mean time Hannibal either finding the impossibility of marching directly to Rome or willing to give his forces rest after such a mighty victory led them to Capua where he resolved to winter This city had long been considered as the nurse of luxury and the corrupter of all military virtue here therefore a new scene of pleasure opened to his barbarian troops and they at once gave themselves up to the intoxication till from being hardy veterans they became infirm rioters  Hitherto we have found this great man successful but now we are to reverse the picture and survey him struggling with accumulated misfortunes and at last sinking beneath them  His first loss was at the siege of Nola where Marcellus the praetor made a successful sally He some time after attempted to raise the siege of Capua and attacked the Romans in their trenches but he was repulsed with considerable loss He then made a feint of going to besiege Rome but finding a superior army ready to receive him he was obliged to retire For some years after he fought with various success Marcellus his opponent  U C  sometimes gaining and sometimes losing the advantage but coming to no decisive engagement  The senate of Carthage at length came to a resolution of sending his brother Asdrubal to his assistance with a body of forces drawn out of Spain Asdrubal's march being made known to the consuls Livius and Nero they went against him with great expedition and surrounding him in a place into which he was led by the treachery of his guides they cut his whole army to pieces Hannibal had long expected these succours with impatience and the very night on which he had been assured of his brother's arrival Nero ordered Asdrubal's head to be  cut off and thrown into his brother's camp The Carthaginian general now therefore began to perceive the approaches of the downfall of Carthage  and could not help with a sigh observing to those about him that fortune seemed fatigued with granting her favours  In the mean time fortune seemed to favour the Roman arms in other parts Marcellus took the city of Syracuse in Sicily which was defended by the machines and the fires of Archimedes the mathematician  The inhabitants were put to the sword and mong the rest Archimedes himself who was found meditating in his study by a Roman soldier Marcellus the general was not a little grieved at his death A passion for letters at that time began to prevail among the higher ranks of people at Rome He therefore ordered his body to be honourably buried and a ton b  o be erected to his memory which his own works have long survived  As to their fortunes in Spain though for a while they appeared doubtful two of the Scipios being slain and Claudius Nero the governor of the province appearing much an undermatch for the cunning of the Carthaginian general yet they soon recovered their complexion under the conduct of Scipio Africanus who sued for the office of proconsul to that kingdom at a time when every one else was willing to decline it Scipio who was now but twentyfour years old had all the qualifications requisite for forming a great general and a good man  e united the greatest courage with the greatest tenderness superior to Hannibal in the arts of peace and almost his equal in those of war His father had been killed in Spain so that he seemed to have an hereditary claim to attack that country He therefore appeared irresistible obtaining many great victories  yet subduing still more by his generosity mildness and benevolent disposition than by the force of his arms  It was shortly after that he returned with an army from the conquest of Spain and was made consul at the age of twentynine It was at first supposed he intended meeting Hannibal in Italy and that he would attempt driving him from thence but he had already formed a wiser plan which was to carry the war into Africa and while the Carthaginians kept an army near Rome to make them tremble for their own capital  Scipio was not long in Africa without employment for in a short time Hanno opposed him but he was defeated and slain Syphax the usurper of Numidia led up a large army against him The Roman general for a time declined sighting till finding an opportunity he set fire  n the enemy's tents and attacking them in the midst of the confusion killed forty thousand men and took six thousand prisoners  The Carthaginians now beginning to be terrified at their repeated defeats and the fame of Scipio's successes determined to recall Hannibal their great champion out of Italy in order to oppose the Romans at home Deputies were accordingly dispatched with a positive command for him to return and oppose the Roman general who at that time threatened Carthage with a siege Nothing could exceed the regret and disappointment of Hannibal upon receiving this order However he obeyed the orders of his infatuated country with the same submission that the meanest soldier would have done and took leave of Italy with tears in his eyes after having kept possession of the most beautiful parts of it for above fifteen years  Upon his arrival at Leptis in Africa from whence he marched to Adrumetum he at last approached  Zama a city within five days journey of Carthage Scipio in the mean time led his army to meet him joined by Massinissa with six thousand horse and to shew his rival in the field how little he feared his approach sent back the spies which were sent to explore his camp having previously shewn them the whole with directions to inform Hannibal of what they had seen The Carthaginian general conscious of his inferiority endeavoured to discontinue the war by negociation and desired a meeting with Scipio to confer upon terms of peace to which the Roman general assented But after a long conference both sides parting dissatisfied they returned to their camps to prepare for deciding the controversy by the sword Never was a more memorable battle fought whether we regard the generals the armies the two states that contended or the empire that was in dispute The disposition Hannibal made of his men is said by the skilful in the art of war to be superior to any even of his former arrangements The battle began with the elephants on the side of the Carthaginians which being terrified at the cries of the Romans and wounded by the slingers and archers turned upon their drivers and caused much confusion in both wings of their army in which the cavalry was placed Being thus deprived of the assistance of the horse in which their greatest strength consisted the heavy infantry joined on both sides but the Romans being stronger of body the Carthaginians were obliged to give ground In the mean time Massinissa who had been in pursuit of their cavalry returning and attacking them in the rear completed their defeat A total rout ensued twenty thousand men were killed in the battle or the pursuit and as many were taken prisoners Hannibal who had done all that a great general and an undaunted soldier could perform fled with a small body of horse to Adrume  um  fortune seeming to delight in confounding his ability his valour and experience  This victory brought on a peace The Carthaginians by Hannibal's advice offered conditions to the Romans which they dictated not as rivals but as sovereigns By this treaty the Carthaginians were obliged to quit Spain and all the islands in the Mediterranean sea They were bound to pay ten thousand talents in fifty years to give hostages for the delivery of their ships and their elephants to restore Massinissa all the territories that had been taken from him and not to make war in Africa but by  he permission of the Romans Thus ended the second Punic war seventeen years after it had begun  CHAP XVI From the end of the second Punic war to the end of the third which terminated in the destruction of Carthage  WHILE the Romans were engaged with Hannibal they carried on also a vigorous war against Philip king of Macedonia not a little incited thereto by the prayers of the Athenians who from once controlling the power of Persia were now unable to defend themselves The Rhodians with Attalus king of Pergamus also entered into the confederacy against Philip He was more than once defeated by Galba the consul who was sent against him He attempted to besiege Athens but the Romans obliged him to raise the siege He attempted to take possession of the streights of Thermopylae but was driven from them by Quintus Flaminius with great slaughter He attempted to take refuge in Thessaly where he was again defeated with considerable loss  and obliged to beg a peace upon condition of paying a thousand talents half down and the other half in the space of ten years The peace with Philip gave the Romans an opportunity of shewing their generosity by restoring liberty to Greece  Antiochus king of Syria was next brought to submit to the Roman arms after some embassies on the one side and the other a war was declared against him five years after the conclusion of the Macedonian war  After various mistakes and misconduct he attempted to obtain a peace by offering to quit all his places in Europe and such in Asia as professed alliance to Rome But it was now too late Scipio perceiving his own superiority was resolved to avail himself of it Antiochus thus driven into resistance for some time retreated before the enemy till being pressed hard near the city of Magnesia he was forced to draw out his men to the number of seventy thousand foot and twelve thousand horse Scipio opposed him with forces as much inferior in number as they were superior in courage and discipline Antiochus therefore was in a short time entirely defeated his own chariots armed with scythes being driven back upon his men contributed much to his overthrow Being thus reduced to the last extremity he was glad to procure peace of the Romans upon their own terms which were to pay fifteen thousand talents towards the expences of the war to quit all his possessions in Europe and like wise all in Asia on that side Mount Taurus to give twenty hostages as pledges of his fidelity and to deliver up Hannibal the inveterate enemy o  Rome  In the mean time Hannibal whose destructio  was one of the articles of this extorted treaty en+deavoured to avoid the threatened ruin This con+summate general had been long a wanderer and a  exile from his ungrateful country He had taken refuge at the court of Antiochus who at first gave him a sincere welcome and made him admiral of his fleet in which station he shewed his usual skill in stratagem But he soon sunk in the Syrian's esteem for having advised schemes which that monarch had neither genius to understand nor talents to execute Sure therefore to find no safety or protection he departed by stealth and after wandering for a time among petty states who had neither power nor generosity to protect him he took refuge at the court of Prusias king of Bithynia In the mean time the Romans with a vindictive spirit utterly unworthy of them sent Aemilius one of their most celebrated generals to demand him of this king who fearing the resentment of Rome and willing to conciliate their friendship by this breach of hospitality ordered a guard to be placed upon Hannibal with an intent to deliver him up The poor old general thus implacably persecuted from one country to another and finding all methods of safety cut off determined to die he therefore desired one of his followers to bring him poison which he had ready for this exigence and drinking it he expired as he had lived with intrepid bravery  A second Macedonian war was soon after proclaimed against Perseus the son of Philip  U C  whom we have already seen obliged to beg peace of the Romans Perseus in order to secure the crown had contrived to murder his brother Demetrius and upon the death of his father pleased with the hopes of imaginary triumphs made war against Rome During the course of this war which continued about three years many opportunities were offered him of cutting off the Roman army but being perfectly ignorant how to take advantage of their rashness he spent the time in empty  overtures for a peace At length Aemilius gave him a decisive overthrow near the river Enipeus He attempted to procure safety by flying into Crete but being abandoned by all he was obliged to surrender himself and to grace the splendid triumph of the Roman general  About this time Massinissa the Numidian having made some incursions into a territory claimed by the Carthaginians they attempted to repel the invasion This brought on a war between that monarch and them while the Romans who pretended to consider this conduct of theirs as an infraction of the treaty sent to make a complaint The ambassadors who were employed upon this occasion finding the city very rich and flourishing from the long interval of peace which it had now enjoyed for near fifty years either from motives of avarice to possess its plunder or from fear of its growing greatness insisted much on the necessity of a war which was soon after proclaimed and the consuls set out with a thorough resolution utterly to demolish Carthage  The wretched Carthaginians finding that the conquerors would not desist from making demands while they had any thing left to supply attempted to soften the victors by submission but they received orders to leave their city which was to be levelled with the ground This severe command they received with all the concern and distress of a despairing people they implored for a respite from such an hard sentence they used tears and lamentations▪ but finding the consuls inexorable they departed with a gloomy resolution prepared to suffer the utmost extremities and to fight to the last for their sea  of empire  Those vessels therefore of gold and silver which their luxury had taken such pride in were convert+ed into arms The women parted also with thei  ornaments and even cut off their hair to be converted  into strings for the bowmen Asdrubal who had been lately condemned for opposing the Romans was now taken from prison to head their army and such preparations were made that when the consuls came before the city which they expected to find an easy conquest they met with such resistance as quite dispirited their forces and shook their resolution Several engagements were fought before the walls with disadvantage to the assailants so that the siege would have been discontinued had not Scipio Aemilianus the adopted son of Africanus who was now appointed to command it used as much skill to save his forces after a defeat as to inspire them with fresh hopes of victory But all his arts would have failed had he not found means to seduce Pharneas the master of the Carthaginian horse who came over to his side The unhappy townsmen soon saw the enemy make nearer approaches the wall which led to the haven was quickly demolished soon after the Forum itself was taken which offered the conquerors a deplorable spectacle of houses nodding to the fall heaps of men lying dead hundreds of the wounded struggling to emerge from the carnage around them and deploring their own and their country's ruin The citadel soon after surrendered at discretion All now but the temple was subdued and that was defended by deserters from the Roman army and those who had been most forward to undertake the war These however expecting no mercy and finding their condition desperate set fire to the building and voluntarily perished in the flames This was the end of one of the most renowned cities in the world both for arts opulence and extent of dominion it had rivalled Rome for above an hundred years and at one time was thought to have the superiority  This conquest over Carthage was soon followed by many over other states Corinth one of the noblest  cities of Greece in the same year sustained the same fate being entered by Mummius the consul and levelled to the ground Scipio also having laid siege to Numantia the strongest city in Spain the wretched inhabitants to avoid falling into the hands of the enemy fired the city over their own heads and all to a man expired in the flames Thus Spain became a province belonging to Rome and was governed thenceforward by two annual praetors  CHAP XVII From the destruction of Carthage to the end of the sedition of the Gracchi U C  THE Romans now being left without a rival the triumphs and the spoils of Asia brought in a taste for splendid expence and these produced avarice and inverted ambition The two Gracchi were the first who saw this strange corruption among the great and resolved to repress it by renewing the Licinian law which had enacted that no person in the state should possess above five hundred acres of land Tiberius Gracchus the elder of the two was a person very considerable both for the advantages of his body and the qualities of his mind Very different from Scipio of whom he was the grandson he seemed more ambitious of power than desirous of glory his compassion for the oppressed was equal to his animosity against the oppressors but unhappily his passions rather than his reason operated even in his pursuits of virtue and these always drove him beyond the line of duty This was the disposition of the elder Gracchus who found the lower part of the people ready to second all his proposals This law though at first carried on with proper moderation greatly disgusted the rich who  endeavoured to persuade the people that the proposer only aimed at disturbing the government and putting all things into confusion But Gracchus who was a man of the greatest eloquence of his time easily wiped off these impressions from the minds of the people already irritated with their wrongs and at length the law was passed  The death of Attalus king of Pergamus furnished Tiberius Gracchus with a new opportunity of gratifying the meaner part of the people at the expence of the great This king had by his last will left the Romans his heirs and it was now proposed that the money so left should be divided among the poor in order to furnish them with proper utensils for cultivating the lands which became theirs by the late law of partition This caused still greater disturbances than before the senate assembled upon this occasion in order to consult the most proper methods of securing these riches to themselves which they now valued above the safety of the commonwealth they had numerous dependents who were willing to give up liberty for plenty and ease these therefore were commanded to be in readiness to intimidate the people who expected no such opposition and who were now attending to the harrangues of Tiberius Gracchus in the Capitol Here as a  lamour was raised by the clients of the great on one side and by the favourers of the law on the other Tiberius found his speech intirely interrupted and begged in vain to be attended to till at last raising his hand to his head to intimate that his life was in danger the partizans of the senate gave out that he wanted a diadem In consequence of this an universal uproar spread itself through all ranks of people the corrupt part of the senate were of opinion that the consul should defend the commonwealth by force of arms but this prudent magistrate declining such violence Scipio Nasica kinsman to Gracchus  immediately rose up and preparing himself for the contest desired that all who would defend the dignity and the authority of the laws should follow him▪ Upon this attended by a large body of senators and clients armed with clubs he went directly to the Capitol striking down all who ventured to resist Tiberius perceiving by the tumult that his life was sought for endeavoured to fly and throwing aside his robe to expedite his escape attempted to g  through the throng but happening to fall over a person already on the ground Saturnius one of his colleagues in the tribuneship who was of the opposite faction struck him dead with a piece of a seat  and not less than three hundred of his hearers shared the same fate being killed in the tumult Nor did the vengeance of the senate rest here but extended to numbers of those who seemed to espouse his cause  many of them were put to death many were banished and nothing was omitted to inspire the people with an abhorrence of his pretended crimes  Caius Gracchus the brother of him who was slain was but twentyone upon the death of Tiberius and as he was too young to be much dreaded by the great so he was at first unwilling to incur their resentment by aims beyond his reach he therefore lived in retirement unseen and almost forgotten But while he thus seemed desirous of avoiding popularity h  was employing his solitude in the study of eloquence which was the readiest means to obtain it at length when he thought himself qualified to serve his country he offered himself candidate for the quaestorship to the army in Sardinia which he readily obtained▪ His valour affability and temperance in this office was remarked by all The king of Numidia sending a present of corn to the Romans ordered his ambassadors to say that it was entirely as a tribute to the virtues of Caius Gracchus This the senate treated with scorn and ordered the ambassadors to be dismissed  with contempt as ignorant barbarians which so enflamed the resentment of young Gracchus that he immediately came from the army to complain of the indignity thrown upon his reputation and to offer himself for the tribuneship of the people It was then that the great found in this youth who had been hitherto neglected upon account of his age a more formidable antagonist than even his brother had been Notwithstanding the warmest opposition from the senate he was declared tribune by a very large majority and he now prepared to run the same career which his brother had gone before him  His first effort was to have Popilius one of the most inveterate of his brother's enemies cited before the people who rather than stand the event of a trial chose to go into voluntary banishment He next procured an edict granting the freedom of the city to the inhabitants of Latium and soon after to all the people on that side the Alps He afterwards fixed the price of corn to a moderate standard and procured a monthly distribution of it among the people He then proceeded to an inspection into the late corruptions of the senate in which the whole body being convicted of bribery extortion and the safe of offices for at that time a total degeneracy seemed to have taken place a law was made transferring the power of judging corrupt magistrates from the senate to the knights which made a great alteration in the constitution  Gracchus by these means being grown not only very popular but very powerful in the state was become an object at which the senate aimed all their resentment But he soon found the populace a faithless and unsteady support they began to withdraw all their confidence from him and to place it upon Drusus a man insidiously set up against him by the senate It was in vain that he revived the Licinian  law in their favour and called up several of the inhabitants of the different towns of Italy to his support the senate ordered them all to depart Rome and even sent one stranger to prison whom Gracchus had invited to live with him and honoured with his table and friendship To this indignity was shortly after added a disgrace of a more fatal tendency for standing for the tribuneship a third time he was rejected it being supposed that the officers whose duty it was to make the return were bribed to reject him though fairly chosen  It was now seen that the fate of Gracchus was resolved on Opimius the consul was not contented with the protection of all the senate and the knights with a numerous retinue of slaves and clients but ordered a body of Candians that were mercenaries in the Roman service to follow and attend him Thus guarded and conscious of the superiority of his forces he insulted Gracchus wherever he met him doing all in his power to produce a quarrel in which he might have a pretence of dispatching his enemy in the fray Gracchus avoided all recrimination and as if apprised of the consul's designs would not even wear any kind of arms for his defence His friend Flaccus however a zealous tribune was not so remiss but resolved to oppose party against party and for this purpose brought up several countrymen to Rome who came under pretence of desiring employment When the day for determining the controversy was arrived the two parties early in the morning attended at the Capitol where while the consul was sacrificing according to custom one of the lictors taking up the entrails of the beast that was slain in order to remove them could not forbear crying out to Fulvius and his party  You ye factious citizens make way for honest men  This insult so provoked the party to whom it was addressed that they instantly fell upon him and pierced him to death  with the instruments they used in writing which they then happened to have in their hands This murder caused a great disturbance in the assembly but particularly Gracchus who saw the consequences that were likely to ensue reprimanded his party for giving his enemies such advantage over him but now prepared to lead his followers to Mount Aventine It was there he learned that proclamation had been made by the consuls that whoever should bring either his head or that of Flaccus should receive its weight in gold as a reward It was to no purpose that he sent the youngest son of Flaccus who was yet a child with proposals for an accommodation The senate and the consuls who were sensible of their superiority rejected all his offers and resolved to punish his offence with nothing less than death and they offered pardon also to all who should leave him immediately This produced the desired effect the people fell from him by degrees and left him with very inferior forces In the mean time Opimius the consul who thirsted for slaughter leading his forces up to Mount Aventine fell in among the crowd with ungovernable fury a terrible slaughter of the scarce resisting multitude ensued and not less than three thousand citizens were slain upon the spot Flaccus attempted to find shelter in a ruinous cottage but being discovered was slain with his eldest son Gracchus at first retired to the temple of Diana where he was resolved to die by his own hand but was prevented by two of his faithful friends and followers Pomponius and Lucinius who forced him to seek safety by slight From thence he made the best of his way to cross a bridge that led from the city still attended by his two generous friends and a Grecian slave whose name was Philocrates But his pursuers still pressed upon him from behind and when come to the foot of the bridge he was obliged to turn and face the enemy His two friends were  soon slain defending him against the crowd and he was forced to take refuge with his slave in a grove beyond the Tyber which had long been dedicated to the Furies Here finding himself surrounded on every side and no way left of escaping he prevailed upon his slave to kill him who immediately after killed himself and fell down dead upon the both of his beloved master The pursuers soon coming up cut off the head of Gracchus and placed it for a while as a trophy upon a spear Soon after one Septimuleius carrying it home there first having secretly taken out the brain he filled it with lead in order to make it weigh heavier and thus received of the consul seventeen pounds of gold as his recompence  Thus died Caius Gracchus about ten years after his brother Tiberius and six after he began to be active in the commonwealth He is usually impeached by historians as guilty of sedition but from what we see of his character the disturbance of public tranquility was rather owing to his opposers than to him so that instead of calling the tumults of that time the sedition of the Gracchi we should rather call them the sedition of the senate against the Gracchi since the efforts of the latter were made in vindication of a law to which the senate had assented and as the designs of the former were supported by an extraneous armed power from the country that had never before meddled in the business of the legislation and whose introduction gave a most irrecoverable blow to the constitution Whether the Gracchi were actuated by motives of ambition or of patriotism in the promulgation of these laws it is impossible to determine but certain it is from what appears that all justice was on their side and all injury on that of the senate In fact this body was now quite changed from that venerable assembly which we have seen overthrowing Pyrrhus and Hannibal  as much by their virtues as their arms They were now only to be distinguished from the rest of the people by their superior luxuries and ruled the commonwealth by the weight of that authority which is gained from riches and a number of mercenary dependencies All the venal and the base were attached to them from motives of selfinterest and they who still ventured to be independent were borne down and entirely lost in the infamous majority In short the empire at this period came under the government of an hateful aristocracy the tribunes who were formerly accounted protectors of the people becoming rich themselves and having no longer opposite interests from those of the senate concurred in their oppressions since as has been said it was not now the struggle between patricians and plebeians who only nominally differed but between the rich and the poor The lower orders of the state being by these means reduced to a degree of hopeless subjection instead of looking after liberty only sought for a leader while the rich with all the suspicion of tyrants terrified at the slightest appearance of opposition entrusted men with uncontroulable power from whom they had not strength to withdraw it when the danger was over Thus both parts of the state concurred in giving up their freedom the fears of the senate first made the dictator and the hatred of the people kept him in his office Nothing can be more dreadful to a thinking mind than the government of Rome from this period till it found refuge under the protection of Augustus  CHAP XVIII From the sedition of Gracchus to the perpetual dic+tatorship of Sylla which was the first step toward the ruin of the commonwealth of Rome  WHILE the Romans were in this state of de+plorable corruption at home they nevertheless wer  very successful in their transactions with regard t  foreign powers  Jugurtha was grandson to the famous Massinissa who sided against Hannibal with Rome He wa  educated with the two young princes who were lef  to inherit the kingdom and being superior in abili+ties to both and greatly in favour with the people he murdered Hiempsal the eldest son and attempted the same by Adherbal the younger who made hi  escape and fled to the Romans for succour Where upon Jugurtha being sensible how much avarie  and injustice had crept into the senate sent his am+bassadors with large presents to Rome who so suc+cessfully prevailed that the senate decreed him hal  the kingdom which he had thus acquired by murde  and usurpation and sent ten commissioners to divide it between him and Adherbal The commissioners of whom Opimius the murderer of Gracchus was one willing to follow the example which the senate had set them were also bribed to bestow the mos  rich and populous part of the kingdom upon the usurper who for all that resolved to possess himself of the whole But willing to give a colour to his ambition he only made in the beginning incursions upon his colleague's territories in order to provoke reprisals which he knew how to convert into seeming aggression in case it came before the senate This failing he resolved to throw off the mask  and besieging Adherbal in Cirta his capital he at length got him into his power and murdered him The people of Rome who had still some generosity remaining unanimously complained of this treachery and procured a decree that Jugurtha should be summoned in person before them to give an account of all such as had accepted bribes Jugurtha made no great difficulty in throwing himself upon the clemency of Rome but giving the people no satisfaction he had orders to depart the city and in the mean time Albanus the consul was sent with an army to follow him who giving up the direction of the army to Aulus his brother a person every way unqualified for the command the Romans were compelled to hazard a battle upon disadvantageous terms and the whole army to avoid being cut to pieces was obliged to pass under the yoke  In this condition Metellus the succeeding consul found affairs upon his arrival in Numidia officers without confidence an army without discipline and an enemy ever watchful and intriguing However by his great attention to business and by an integrity that shuddered at corruption he soon began to retrieve the affairs of Rome and the credit of the army In the space of two years Jugurtha was overthrown in several battles forced out of his own dominions and constrained to beg a peace Thus all things promised Metellus an easy and certain victory but he was frustrated in his expectations by the intrigues of Caius Marius his lieutenant who came in to reap that harvest of glory which the other's industry had sown Caius Marius was born in a village near Arpinium of poor parents who gained their living by their labour As he had been bred up in a participation of their toils his manners were as rude as his countenance was frightful He was a man of extraordinary stature incomparable  strength and undaunted bravery When Metellus as has been said was obliged to sollicit at Rome for a continuance of his command Marius whose ambition knew no bounds was resolved to obtain it for himself and thus gain all the glory of putting an end to the war To that end he privately inveighed against Metellus by his emissaries at Rome and having excited a spirit of discontent against him he had leave granted him to go to Rome to stand for the consulship himself which he obtained contrary to the expectation and interest of the nobles  Marius being thus invested with the supreme power of managing the war shewed himself every way fit for the commission His vigilance was equal to his valour and he quickly made himself master of the cities which Jugurtha had yet remaining in Numidia This unfortunate prince finding himself unable to make opposition singly was obliged to have recourse for assistance to Bocchus king of Mauritania to whose daughter he was married A battle soon after ensued in which the Numidians surprised the Roman camp by night and gained a temporary advantage However it was but of short continuance for Marius soon after overthrew them in two signal engagements in one of which not less than ninety thousand of the African army were slain Bocchu  now finding the Romans too powerful to be resisted did not think it expedient to hazard his own crown▪ to protect that of his ally he therefore determined to make peace upon whatever conditions he might obtain it and accordingly sent to Rome imploring protection The senate received the ambassador with their usual haughtiness and without comply+ing with their request granted the suppliant no  their friendship but their pardon Notwithstand+ing after some time he was given to understand that the delivering up of Jugurtha to the Romans  would in some measure conciliate their favour and soften their resentment At first the pride of Bocchus struggled against such a proposal but a few interviews with Sylla who was quaestor to Marius reconciled him to this treacherous measure At length therefore Jugurtha was given up being drawn into an ambuscade by the specious pretences of his ally who deluded him by desiring a conference and being made a prisoner he was carried by Marius to Rome loaded with chains a deplorable instance of blasted ambition He did not long survive his overthrow being condemned by the senate to be starved to death in prison a short time after he had adorned the triumph of the conqueror  Marius by this and two succeeding victories over the Gauls having become very formidable to distant nations in war became soon after much more dangerous to his fellowcitizens in peace  The strength which he had given the popular party every day grew more conspicuous and the Italians being frustrated in their aims of gaining the freedom of Rome by the intrigues of the senate they resolved upon obtaining by force what was refused them as a favour This gave rise to the Social war in which most of the states of Italy entered into a confederacy against Rome in order to obtain a redress of this and all the rest of their grievances  After a lapse of two years this war having continued to rage with doubtful success the senate began to reflect that whether conquered or conquerors the power of the Romans was in danger of being totally destroyed In order therefore to soften their compliance by degrees they began by giving the freedom of the city to such of the Italian states as had not revolted They then offered it to such as would soonest lay down their arms This unexpected  bounty had the desired effect the allies with mutual distrust offered each a separate treaty the senate took them one by one into favour but gave the freedom of the city in such a manner that being empowered to vote not until all the other tribes had given their suffrages they had very little weight in the constitution In this manner they were made free all but the Samnites and Lucanians who seemed excluded from the general compromise as if to leave Sylla who commanded against them the glory of putting an end to the war this he performed with great conduct storming their camps overthrowing them in several battles and obliging them to submit to such terms as the senate were pleased to impose  This destructive war being concluded which as Paterculus says consumed above three hundred thousand of the flower of Italy the senate now began to think of turning their arms against Mithridates the most powerful and warlike monarch of the East  For this expedition Marius had long been preparing but Sylla who now began to make a figure in the commonwealth had interest enough to get Marius set aside and himself appointed to the expedition Marius however tried all his arts with the people to get this appointment reversed and at length procured a law to be enacted that the command of the army appointed to oppose Mithridates was to be transferred from Sylla to Marius  In consequence of this Marius immediately sent down officers from Rome to take command in his name But instead of obeying their orders they fell upon and slew the officers and then entreated Sylla that he would lead them directly to take signal vengeance upon all his enemies at Rome  Accordingly his soldiers entered the city sword in hand as a place taken by storm Marius and Sulpicius at the head of a tumultuary body of their  partizans attempted to oppose their entrance and the citizens themselves who feared the sackage of the place threw down stones and tyles from the tops of the houses upon the intruders So unequal a conflict lasted longer than could have been expected at length Marius and his party were obliged to seek safety by flight after having vainly offered liberty to all the slaves who would assist them in this emergency  Sylla now finding himself master of the city began by modelling the laws so as to favour his outrages While Marius driven out of Rome and declared a public enemy at the age of seventy was obliged to save himself unattended and on foot from the numerous pursuits of those who sought his life After having wandered for some time in this deplorable condition he found every day his dangers encrease and his pursuers making nearer advances In this distress he was obliged to conceal himself in the marshes of Minturnum where he spent the night up to his chin in a quagmire At break of day he left this dismal place and made towards the sea side in hopes of finding a ship to facilitate his escape but being known and discovered by some of the inhabitants he was conducted to a neighbouring town with an halter round his neck without cloaths and covered over with mud was sent to prison The governor of the place willing to conform to the orders of the senate soon after sent a Cimbrian slave to dispatch him but the barbarian no sooner entered the dungeon for this purpose but he stopt short intimidated by the dreadful visage and awful voice of the fallen general who sternly demanded if he had the presumption to kill Caius Marius The slave unable to reply threw down his sword and rushing back from the prison cried out that he found it impossible to kill him The governor considering the fear of the slave as an omen in the unhappy exile's  favour gave him once more his freedom and commending him to his fortune provided him with a ship to convey him from Italy He from thence made the best of his way to the island of Aenaria and sailing onward was forced by a tempest on the coast of Sicily There a Roman quaestor who happened to be at the same place resolved to seize him by which he lost sixteen of his crew who were killed in their endeavours to cover his retreat to the ship He afterwards landed in Africa near Carthage and went in a melancholy manner to place himself amongst the ruins of that desolated place He soon however had orders from the praetor who governed there to retire Marius who remembered his having once served this very man when in necessity could not suppress his sorrow at finding ingratitude in every quarter of the would and preparing to obey desired the messenger to tell his master that he had seen Marius sitting among the ruins of Carthage intimating the greatness of his own fall by the desolation that was found him He then embarked once more and not knowing where to land without encountering an enemy spent the winter at sea expecting every hour the return of a messenger from his son whom he had sent to sollicit protection from an African prince whose name was Mand  astal After long expectation instead of the messenger his son himself arrived having escaped from the inhospitable court of that monarch where he had been kept not as a friend but a prisoner and had returned just time enough to prevent his father from sharing the same fate It was in this situation that they were informed that Cinna one of their party who had remained at Rome had restored their affairs and headed a large army of the Italian states in his cause  Nor was it long before they joined their forces and presented themselves at the gates of Rome Sylla  was at that time absent in his command against Mi  hridates wh  e Cinna marched into the city accompanied by his guards but Marius stopped and refused to enter alledging that having been banished by a public decree it was necessary to have another to authorize his return It was thus that he desired to give his meditated cruelties the appearance of justice and while he was about to destroy thousands to pretend an implicit veneration for the laws In pursuance of his desire an assembly of the people being called they began to reverse his banishment but they had scarce gone through three of the tribes when incapable of containing his desire of revenge he entered the city at the head of his guards and massacred all that had ever been obnoxious to him without remorse or pity Several who sought to propitiate the tyrant's rage were murdered by his command in his presence many even of those who had never offended him were put to death and at last even his own officers never approached him but with error Having in this manner punished his enemies be next abrogated all the laws which were made by his rival and then made himself consul with Cinna Thus gratified in his two favourite passions vengeance and ambition having once saved his country and now deluged it with blood at last as if willing to crown the pile of slaughter which he had made with his own body he died the month after aged seventy not without suspicion of having hastened his  ad  In the mean time these accounts were brought to Sylla who was sent against Mithridates and who was performing many signal services against him but conc  uding a peace with that monarch he resolved to return home to take revenge of his enemies at Rome  In the mean time nothing could intimidate Cinna from making preparations to repel his opponent Being  joined by Carbo who was now elected in the room of Valerius who had been slain together with young Marius who inherited all the abilities and the ambition of his father he determined to send over part of the forces he had raised into Dalmatia to oppose Sylla before he entired Italy Some troops were accordingly embarked but these being dispersed by a storm the rest that had not yet put to sea absolutely refused to go Upon this Cinna quite furious at their disobedience rushed forward to persade them to their duty In the mean time one of the most mutinous of the soldiers being struck by an officer returned the blow and was apprehended for his crime This illtimed severity produced a tumult and a mutiny through the whole army and while Cinna did all he could to prevent or appease it he was run through the body by one of the crowd  Scipio the consul who commanded against Sylla was soon after allured by proposals for coming to a treaty but a suspension of arms being agreed upon Sylla's soldiers went into the opposite camp displaying those riches which they had acquired in their expeditions and offering to participate with their fellowcitizens in case they changed their party Accordingly the whole army declared unanimously for Sylla and Scipio scarce knew that he was forsaken and deposed till he was informed of it by a party of the enemy who entering his tent made him and his son their prisoners  In this manner both factions exasperated to the highest degree and expecting no mercy on either part gave vent to their fury in several engagements The forces on the side of young Marius who now succeeded his father in command were the mos  numerous but those of Sylla better united and mor  under subordination Carbo who commanded an army for Marius in the field sent eight legions to  Praeneste to relieve his colleague but they were met by Pompey afterwards surnamed the Great in a defile who slew many of them and dispersed the rest Carbo joined by Urbanus soon after engaged Meteilus but was overcome with the loss of ten thousand men slain and six thousand taken prisoners In consequence of this defeat Urbanus killed himself and Carbo sled to Africa where after wandering a long time he was at last delivered up to Pompey who to please Sylla ordered him to be beheaded Sylla now become undisputed master of his country entered Rome at the head of his army Happy had he supported in peace the glory which he had acquired in war or had he ceased to live when he ceased to conquer  Eight thousand men who had escaped the general carnage offered themselves to the conqueror he ordered them to be put into the Villa Publica a large house in the Campus Martius and at the same time convoked the senate there he spoke with great  tency and in a manner no way discomposed of his own exploits and in the mean time gave pri  te directions that all those wretches whom he had confined should be slain The senate amazed at the ho  id outcries of the sufferers at first thought  the city was given up to plunder but Sylla  an unembarrassed air informed them that it was only some criminals who were punished by his order and that they needed not to make themselves un  asy about their fate The day after he proscribed forty senators and sixteen hundred knights and after  intermission of two days forty senators more  infinite number of the richest citizens of Rome  H  next resolved to invest himself with the dictatorship and that for a perpetuity and thus uniting all cl  as well as military power in his own person  he was conscious he might thence give an air of justice to every oppression  In this manner he continued to govern with capricious tyranny none daring to resist his power until contrary to the expectations of all mankind he laid down the dictatorship having held it not quite three years  After this he retired into the country in order to enjoy the pleasures of tranquility and social happiness but he did not long survive his abdication he died of that disease which is called the morbus pedicularis a loathsome and mortifying object and capable of shewing the futility of human ambition  CHAP XIX From the Perpetual Dictatorship of Sylla to the Triumvirate of Caesar Pompey and Crassus U C  UPON death of Sylla the jealousies of Pompey and Crassus the two most powerful men in the empire began to excite fresh dissensions Pompey was the most beloved general and Crassus was the richest man in Rome  The first opportunity that was afforded of discovering their mutual jealousy was upon the disbanding their troops with which they had conquered Neither chose to begin so that the most fatal consequences threatened from their dissension but at length Crassus stifling his resentment laid down his command and the other followed his example immediately after The next trial between them was who should be foremost in obtaining the favour of the people Crassus entertained the populace at a thousand different tables distributed corn to the families of the poor and fed the greatest part of the  citizens for near three months Pompey on the other hand laboured to abrogate the laws made against the people's authority by Sylla he restored the power of judging to the knights which had been formerly granted them by Gracchus and gave back to the tribunes of the people all their former privileges It was thus that each gave his private aims a public appearance so that what was in reality ambition in both took with one the name of liberality with the other that of freedom  An expedition in which Pompey cleared the Mediterranean which was infested by pirates having added greatly to his reputation the tribunes of the people hoped it would be easier to advance their favourite still higher wherefore Manilius one of the number preferred a law that all the armies of the empire with the government of all Asia together with the management of the war which was renewed against Mithridates should be committed to him alone The law passed with little opposition and the decree was confirmed by all the tribes of the people  Being thus appointed to the command of that important war he immediately departed for Asia having made the proper preparations towards forwarding the campaign Mithridates had been obliged by Lucullus to take refuge in Lesser Armenia and thither that general was preparing to follow him when his whole army abandoned him so that it remained for Pompey to terminate the war which he effected with great ease and expedition adding a large extent of dominion to the Roman empire and returning to Rome in triumph at the head of his conquering army  But all the victories of Pompey rather served to heighten the glory than to encrease the power of Rome  ey only made it a more glaring object of ambition and exposed its liberties to greater danger  Those liberties indeed seemed devoted to ruin on every side for even while he was pursuing his conquest abroad Rome was at the verge of ruin from a con+spiracy at home This conspiracy was projected an  carried on by Sergius Catiline a patrician by birth who resolved to build his own power on the downfa  of his country He was singularly formed both b  art and nature to conduct a conspiracy he was pos+sessed of courage equal to the most desperate at+tempts and eloquence to give a colour to his ambi+tion ruined in his fortunes profligate in his man+ners and vigilant in pursuing his aims he was in+satiable after wealth only with a view to lavish it o  his guilty pleasures  Catiline having contracted many debts by th  looseness of such an illspent life was resolved to ex+tricate himself from them by any means however un+lawful  Accordingly he assembled about thirty of hi  debauched associates and informed them of his aims his hopes and his settled plan of operations It was re+solved among them that a general insurrection shoul  be raised throughout Italy the different parts of whic  were assigned to the different leaders Rome was t  be fired in several place at once and Catiline a  the head of an army rai  d in Etruria was in the ge+neral confusion to p  sess himself of the city an  massacre all the senators Lentulus one of his pro+fligate assistants who had been praetor or judge i  the city w  to preside in their general councils Cethegus a  n who sacrificed the possession o  great present  to the hopes of gratifying his re+venge  gainst  was to direct the massacr  thr  ugh the city  aesius was to conduct thos  who fired it But the vigilance of Cicero being  chief obstacle to the  signs Catiline was very de+sirous to see him taken  before he left Rome upo  which two knights of the company undertook to  him the next morning in his bed in an early visit in pretence of business But the meeting was no sooner over than Cicero had information of all that  assed in it for by the intrigues of a woman named Fulvia he had gained over Curius her lover and one of the conspirators to send him a punctual account of all their deliberations Having taken proper precautions to guard himself against the designs of his morning visitors who were punctual to the  ppointment he next took care to provide for the de  ence of the city and assembling the senate consulted what was best to be done in this time of danger The first step taken was to offer considerable rewards for farther discoveries and then to prepare for the defence of the state Catiline to shew how well he could dissemble or justify any crime went boldly to the senate declaring his innocence but when confronted by the eloquence of Cicero he hastily withdrew declaring aloud that since he was denied a vindication of himself and driven headlong by his enemies he would extinguish the flame which was raised about him in universal ruin Accordingly after a short conference with Lentulus and Cethegus he left Rome by night with a small re  inue to make the best of his way towards Etruria where Manilius one of the conspirators was raising in army to support him  In the mean time Cicero took proper precautions to secure all those of the conspiracy who remained in Rome Lentulus Cethegus Caesius and several others were put in confinement and soon after by the command of the senate being delivered over to the executioners were strangled in prison  While his associates were put to death in the city Catiline had raised an army of twelve thousand men of which a fourth part only was completely armed the rest being furnished with what chance afforded darts lances and clubs He refused at first to enlist  slaves who flocked to him in great numbers▪ trusting to the proper strength of the conspiracy but upon the approach of the consul who was sen  against him and upon the arrival of the news tha  his confederates were put to death in Rome the face of his affairs were entirely altered His first attempt therefore was by long marches to make his escape over the Appennines into Gaul but in this his hope were disappointed all the passes being strictly guard+ed by an army under Metellus superior to his own Being thus hemmed in on every side and seeing al  things desperate with nothing left him but either t  die or conquer he resolved to make one vigour+ous effort against that army which pursued him An+tonius the consul being himself sick the command devolved upon his lieutenant Petreius who after  fierce and bloody action in which he lost a consi+derable part of his best troops put Catiline's force to the rout and destroyed his whole army whic  fought desperately to the last man  The extinction of this conspiracy seemed only  leave an open theatre for the ambition of the gre  men of the state to display itself in Pompey w  now returned in triumph from conquering the Ea  as he had before been victorious in Europe an  Africa  Crassus as we have already observed was th  richest man in Rome and next to him possessed o  the greatest authority his party in the senate wa  even stronger than that of Pompey his rival and th  envy raised against him was less He and Pompe  had been long disunited by an opposition of interest and of characters however it was from a continu+ance of their mutual jealousies that the state was  some measure to expect its future safety It was  this situation of things that Julius Caesar who ha  lately gone praetor into Spain and had returned wit  great riches and glory resolved to convert their m  +tual  jealousy to his own advantage This celebrated man was nephew to Marius by the female line and descended from one of the most illustrious families in Rome he had already mounted by the regular gradations of office having been quaestor aedile grand pontiff and praetor in Spain Being descended from popular ancestors he warmly espoused the side of the people and shortly after the death of Sylla procured those whom he had banished to be recalled He had all along declared for the populace against the senate and by this became their most favourite magistrate This consummate statesman began first by offering his services to Pompey promising him his aid in having all his acts passed notwithstanding the senate's opposition Pompey pleased at the acquisition of a person of so much merit readily granted him his confidence and protection He next applied to Crassus who from former connexions was disposed to become still more nearly his friend at length finding neither averse to an union of interests he took an opportunity of bringing them together and remonstrating to them the advantage as well as the necessity of a reconciliation he had art enough to persuade them to forget former animosities A combination was thus formed by which they three agreed that nothing should be done in the commonwealth but what received their mutual concurrence and approbation This was called the First Triumvirate by which we find the constitution weakened by a new interest that had not hitherto taken place in the government very different from that either of the senate or the people and yet dependent on both  CHAP XX From the beginning of the first Triumvirate to the death of Pompey U C  THE first thing Caesar did upon being taken into the triumvirate was to avail himself of the interest of his confederates to obtain the consulship The senate had still some small influence left and though they were obliged to concur in chusing him yet they gave him for a colleague on Bibulus who they supposed would be a check upon his power but the opposition was too strong for even superior abilities to resist it so that Bibulus after a slight attempt in favour of the senate remained inactive Caesar began his schemes for empire by ingratiating himself with the people he procured a law for dividing certain lands in Campania among such of the poor citizens as had at least three children This proposal was just enough in itself and only criminal from the views of the proposer  Having thus strengthened himself at home he next deliberated with his confederates about sharing the foreign provinces of the empire between them The partition was soon made Pompey chose Spain for his own part for being fatigued with conquest and satiated with military fame he was willing to take his pleasures at Rome Crassus chose Syria for his part of the empire which province as it had hitherto enriched the generals who had subdued it would he hoped gratify him in this his most favourite pursuit To Caesar was left the provinces o  Gaul composed of many fierce and powerful nations most of them unsubdued and the rest only professing a nominal subjection Wherefore as i  was rather appointing him to conquer than command▪  this government was granted him for five years as if by its continuance to compensate for its danger  It would be impossible in this narrow compass to enumerate all the battles Caesar fought and the states he subdued in his expeditions into Gaul and Britain which continued eight years The Helvetians were the first that were brought into subjection with the loss of near two hundred thousand men those who remained after the carnage were sent by Caesar in safety to the forests from whence they had issued The Germans with Ariovistus at their head were next cut off to the number of eighty thousand their monarch himself narrowly escaping in a little boat across the Rhine The Belgae were cut off with such great slaughter that marshes and deep rivers were rendered passable from the heaps of s  ain The Nervians who were the most warlike of those barbarous nations made head for a short time and fell upon the Romans with such fury that their army was in danger of being utterly routed but Caesar himself hastily catching up a buckler rushed through his army into the midst of the enemy by which means he so turned the fate of the day that the barbarians were all cut off to a man The Celtic Gauls who were powerful at sea were next brought under subjection After them the Suevi the Menapii and all the nations from the Mediterranean to the British sea From thence stimulated by the desire of conquest he crossed over into Britain upon pretence that the natives had furnished his enemies with continual supplies Upon approaching the shores he found them covered with men to oppose his landing and his forces were in danger of being driven back till the standard bearer of the tenth legion boldly leaped ashore and being well assisted by Caesar the natives were put to flight The Britons being terrified at Caesar's power sent to desire  a peace which was granted them and some hostage delivered A storm however soon after destroyin  great part of his fleet they resolved to take advan+tage of the disaster and marched against him with  powerful army But what could a naked undisci+plined army do against forces that had been exercise under the greatest generals and hardened by th  conquests of the greatest part of the world Bein  overthrown they were obliged once more to sue fo  peace which Caesar granted them and then return+ed to the continent Thus in less than nine year  he conquered together with Britain all that coun+try which extends from the Mediterranean to th  German sea  While Caesar was thus encreasing his reputatio  and riches abroad Pompey who remained all th  time in Rome steadily cooperated with his ambi+tion and advanced his interests while he vainly su  +posed he was forwarding his own By his mean  Caesar was continued five years longer in Gual n  was he roused from his lethargy till the same  that great commander's valour riches and humani+ty began secretly to give him pain and to mak  him suppose they began to eclipse his own for  being more recent they were more talked of H  now therefore began to do all in his power to di+minish Caesar's reputation obliging the magistrat  not to publish any letters they received from him till he had diminished the credit of them by spread+ing disadvantageous reports one or two accident also helped to widen the separation namely the death of Julia Pompey's wife who had not a litt  contributed to improve the harmony that subsisted be+tween them and the destruction of Crassus who had conducted the war against the Parthians with so little prudence that he suffered the enemy  o get the advantage of him in almost every skirmish▪ and incapable of extricating himself from the dif+ficulties  in which he was involved he fell a sacrifice to his own rashness being killed bravely defending himself to the last  Caesar who now began to be sensible of the jealousies of Pompey took occasion to solicit for the consulship together with a prolongation of his government in Gaul desirous of trying whether Pompey would thwart or promote his pretensions In this Pompey seemed to be quite inactive but at the same time privately employed two of his creatures who alledged in the senate that the laws did not permit a person that was absent to offer himself as a candidate for that high office Pompey's view in this was to allure Caesar from his government in order to stand for the consulship in person Caesar however perceiving his artifice chose to remain in his province convinced that while he headed such an army as was now devoted to his interests he could at any time give laws as well as magistrates to the state  The senate which were now devoted to Pompey because he had for some time attempted to defend them from the encroachments of the people ordered two legions which were in Caesar's army belonging to Pompey home as it was pretended to oppose the Parthians but in reality to diminish Caesar's power Caesar easily saw their motive but as his plans were not yet ready for execution he sent them home in pursuance of the orders of the senate having previously attached the officers to him with benefits and the soldiers with a bounty The next step the senate took was to recall Caesar from his government as his time was now very near expiring  ut Curio his friend in the senate proposed that Caesar should not leave his army till Pompey had set him the example This for a while perplexed Pompey however during the debate one of the senate declaring that Caesar was past the Alps and  marching with his whole army directly toward Rome the consul immediately quitting the senate went with his colleague forth from the city to an house where Pompey at that time resided He there presented him with a sword commanding him to march against Caesar and fight in defence of the commonwealth Pompey declared he was ready to obey but with an air of pretended moderation added that it was only in case more gentle expedients could not be employed  Caesar who was instructed in all that passed by his partizans at Rome though he was still in Gaul was willing to give his aims all the appearance of justice He agreed to lay down his employment when Pompey should do the same But the senate rejected all his propositions blindly confident of their own power and relying on the assurances of Pompey Caesar still unwilling to come to an open rupture with the state at last was content to ask the government of Illyria with two legions but this also was refused him Now therefore finding all hopes of an accommodation fruitless and conscious if not of the goodness of his cause at least of the goodness of his troops he began to draw them down towards the confines of Italy and passing the Alps with his third legion stopt at Ravenna a city of Cisalpine Gaul from whence he once more wrote a letter to the consuls declaring that he was ready to resign all command in case Pompey did so too On the other hand the senate decreed that Caesar should lay down his government and disband his forces within a limited time and if he refused obedience that he should be declared an enemy to the commonwealth  Caesar however seemed no way disturbed at these violent proceedings the night before his intended expedition into Italy he sat down to table chearfully conversing with his friends on subjects of literature  and philosophy and apparently disengaged from every ambitious concern After some time rising up he desired the company to make themselves chearful in his absence and that he would be with them in a moment in the mean time having ordered his chariot to be prepared he immediately set out attended by a few friends for Arminium a city upon the confines of Italy whither he had dispatched a part of his army the morning before This journey by night which was very satiguing he performed with great diligence sometimes walking and sometimes on horseback till at the break of day he came up with his army which consisted of about five thousand men near the Rubicon a little river which seperates Italy from Gaul and which terminated the limits of his command The Romans had ever been taught to consider this river as the sacred boundary of their domestic empire Caesar therefore when he advanced at the head of his army to the side of the river stopt short upon the bank as if imprest with terror at the greatness of his enterprize He pondered for some time in fixed melancholy looking upon the river and debating with himself whether he should venture in "If I pass this river" says he to one of his generals who stood by him  what miseries shall I bring upon my country and if now I stop short I am undone  Thus saying and resuming all his former alacrity he plunged in crying out that the die was cast and all was now over his soldiers followed him with equal promptitude and quickly arriving at Arminium made themselves masters of the place without any resistance  This unexpected enterprize excited the utmost terrors in Rome every one imagining that Caesar was leading his army to lay the city in ruins At one  me were to be seen the citizens flying into the country for safety and the inhabitants of the country coming up to seek for shelter in Rome In  this universal confusion Pompey felt all that repentance and selfcondemnation which must necessarily arise from the remembrance of having advanced his rival to his present pitch of power wherever he appeared many of his former friends were ready to tax him with his supineness and sarcastically to reproach his illgrounded presumption "Where is now" cried Favonius a ridiculous senator of his party  the army that is to rise at your command Let us see if it will appear by stamping  Cato reminded him of the many warnings he had given him which however as he was continually boding nothing but calamities Pompey might very justly he excused from attending to But being at length wearied with these reproaches which were offered under colour of advice he did all that lay in his power to encourage and confirm his followers he told them that they should not want an army for that he would be their leader he confest indeed that he had all along mistaken Caesar's aims judging of them only from what they ought to be however if his f  iends were still inspired with the love of freedom they might yet enjoy it in whatever place their necessities should happen to conduct them He let them know that their affairs were in a very promising situation that his two lieutenants were at the head of a very considerable army in Spain composed of veteran troops that had made the conquest of the East besides these there were infinite resources both in Asia and Africa together with the succours they were sure to expect from all the kingdoms that were in alliance with Rome This speech served in some measure to revive the hopes of the confederacy The greatest part of the senate his own private friends and dependents together with all those who expected to make their fortunes in his cause agreed to follow him Being in no capacity to resist Caesar a  Rome he resolved to lead his forces to Capua where  he commanded the two legions that served under Caesar in Gaul  Caesar in the mean time after having vainly attempted to bring Pompey to an accommodation resolved to pursue him into Capua before he could collect his forces Accordingly he marched on to take possession of the cities that lay between him and his rival not regarding Rome which he knew would full of course to the conqueror  Corfinium was the first city that attempted to stop the rapidity of his march It was defended by Domitius who had been appointed by the senate to succeed him in Gaul and was garrisoned by twenty cohorts which were levied in the countries adjacent Caesar however quickly invested it and though Domitius sent frequently to Pompey exhorting him to come and raise the siege he was at last obliged to endeavour to escape privately His intentions happ  ned to be divulged the garrison were resolved to consult their own safety by delivering him up to the besiegers Caesar readily accepted their offers but kept his men from immediately entering into the town After some time Lentulus the consul who was one of the besieged came out to implore forgiveness for himself and the rest of his confederates putting Caesar in mind of their ancient friendship and acknowledging the many favours he had received at his hands To this Caesar who would not wait the conclusion of his speech generously replied that he came into Italy not to injure the liberties of Rome and its citizens but to restore them This humane reply being quickly carried into the city the senators and the knights with their children and some officers of the garrison came out to claim the conqueror's protection who just glancing at their ingratitude gave them their liberty with permission to go wheresoever they should think proper But while he dismissed the leaders he upon this as upon  all other occasions took care to attach the common soldiers to his own interest sensible that he might stand in need of an army but that while he lived his army could never stand in need of a commander  Pompey who was unable to continue in Rome having intelligence of what passed upon this occasion immediately retreated to Brundusium where he resolved to stand a siege to retard the enemy until the forces of the empire should be united to oppose him His aim in this succeeded to his wish and after having employed Caesar for some time in a fruitless siege he privately passed his forces over to Dyracchium where the consul had levied a body of forces for his assistance However though he made good his escape he was compelled to leave the whole kingdom of Italy at the mercy of his rival without either a town or an army that had strength to oppose his prog  ess  Caesar finding he could not follow Pompey for want of shipping went back to Rome to take possession of the public treasures which his opponent by a most unaccountable oversight had neglected taking with him However upon his coming up to the door of the treasury Metellus the tribune who guarded it refused to let him pass but Caesar with more than usual emotion laying his hand upon his sword threatened to strike him dead  And know young man  cried he  that it is easier to do this than to say it  This menace had its effect Metellus retired and Caesar took out of the treasury to the amount of three thousand pound weight of gold besides an immense quantity of silver  Having thus provided for continuing the war he departed from Rome resolved to subdue Pompey's lieutenants Afranius and Petreius who had been long in Spain at the head of a veteran army composed of the choicest legions of the empire who had  been ever victorious under all its commanders Caesar however who knew the abilities of its two present generals jocosely said as he was preparing to go thither that he went to fight an army without a general and upon conquering it would return to fight a general without an army  The first conflict which he had with Afranius and Petreius was rather unfavourable It was sought near the city of Herda and both sides claimed the honour of the victory But by various stratagems he reduced them at last to such extremity of hunger and drought that they were obliged to yield at discretion Clemency was his favourite virtue he dismissed them all with the kindest professions and sent them home to Rome loaden with shame and obligations to publish his virtues and confirm the affections of his adherents Thus in the space of about forty days he became master of all Spain and returned again victorious to Rome The citizens upon this occasion received him with fresh demonstrations of joy and created him dictator and consul but the first of these offices he laid down after he had held it but eleven days  While Caesar was thus employed Pompey was equally active in making preparations in Epirus and Greece to oppose him All the monarchs of the East had declared in his favour and sent very large supplies He was master of nine effective Italian legions and had a fleet of five hundred large ships under the conduct of Bibulus an active and experienced commander Added to these he was supplied with large sums of money and all the necessaries for an army from the tributary provinces round him He had attacked Anthony and Dolabella who commanded for Caesar in that part of the empire with such success that the former was obliged to fly and the latter was taken prisoner Crowds of the most distinguished citizens and nobles from Rome came  every day to join him He had at one time above two hundred senators in his camp among whom were Cicero and Cato whose approbation of his cause was equivalent to an army  Notwithstanding these preparations Caesar shipped off five of his twelve legions at Brundusium and weighing anchor fortunately steered through th  midst of his enemies timing it so well that he mad  his passage in one day Still however convince  that the proper time for making proposals for a peac  was after gaining an advantage he sent one Rufus  whom he had taken prisoner to effect an accom+modation with Pompey offering to refer all to th  senate and people of Rome but Pompey once mor  rejected the overture holding the people of Rome to  much in Caesar's interests to be relied on  Pompey had been raising supplies in Macedon  when first informed of Caesar's landing upon the coas  of Epirus he now therefore resolved immediately  march to Dyracchium in order to cover that place fro  Caesar's attempts as all his ammunition and prov  +sions were deposited there The first place that bot  armies came in sight of each other was on the oppo+site banks of the river Apsus and as both were com+manded by the two greatest generals then in the worl  the one renowned for his conquest of the East th  other celebrated for his victories over the Weste  parts of the empire a battle was eagerly desired  the soldiers on either side But neither general wa  willing to hazard it upon this occa  on Pompey could not rely upon his new levies and Caesar would no  venture an engagement till he was joined by the rest of his forces  Caesar had now waited some time with extreme impatience for the coming up of the remainder of his army and even ventured out alone in an open fisher boat to hasten its arrival but he was driven back by a storm However his disappointment was  soon relieved by an information of the landing of the troops he had long expected at Appolionia from whence they were approaching under the conduct of Anthony and Calenus to join him he therefore decamped in order to meet them and prevent Pompey with his army from engaging them on their march as he lay on that side of the river where the succours had been obliged to come on shore  Pompey being compelled to retreat led his forces to Asparagus nigh Dyracchium where he was sure of being supplied with every thing necessary for his army by the numerous fleets which he employed along the coasts of Epirus there he pitched his cam upon a tongue of land as mariners express it that jutted into the sea where also was a small shelter for ships where few winds could annoy them in this place being most advantageously situated he immediately began to entrench his camp which Caesar perceiving and finding that he was not likely soon to quit so advantageous a post began to entrench also behind him And as all beyond Pompey's camp towards the land side was hilly and steep he built redoubts upon the hills stretching round from shore to shore and then caused lines of communication to be drawn from hill to hill by which he blocked up the camp of the enemy He hoped by this blockade to force his opponent to a battle which he ardently desired and which the other with equal industry declined Thus both sides continued for some time employed in designs and stratagems the one to annoy and the other to defend Caesar's men daily carried on their works to straiten the enemy those of Pompey did the same to enlarge themselves having the advantage of numbers and severely galled the enemy by their slingers and  ers Caesar however was indefatigable he caused blinds or man  elets to be made of skins of  c  s to cover his men while at work he cut off all  the water that supplied the enemy's camp and forage from the horses so that there remained no more subsistence for them But Pompey at last resolved to break through his lines and gain some other part of the country more convenient for encampment Accordingly having informed himself of the condition of Caesar's fortifications from some deserters who came over to him he ordered his light infantry and archers on board his ships with directions to attack Caesar's entrenchments by sea where they were least defended This was done with such effect that though Caesar and his officers used their utmost endeavours to hinder Pompey's designs yet by means of reiterated attempts he at last effected his purpose of extricating his army from his former camp and of encamping in another place by the sea where he had the conveniency of forage and shipping also Caesar being thus frustrated in his views of blocking up the enemy and perceiving the loss he had sustained resolved at last to force Pompey to a battle though upon disadvantageous terms The engagement began by attempting to cut off a legion which was posted in a wood and this brought on a general battle The conflict was for some time carried on with great ardour and with equal fortune but Caesar's army being intangled in the entrenchments of the old camps lately abandoned began to fall into disorder upon which Pompey pressing his advantage they at last fled with great precipitation Great numbers perished in the trenches and on the banks of the river or were pressed to death by their fellows Pompey pursued his successes to the very camp of Caesar but either surprised with the suddenness of his victory or fearful of an ambuscade he withdrew his troops into his own camp and thus lost an opportunity of securing his victory  After this defeat which was by no means decisive Caesar marched▪ with all his forces united into  one body directly to Gomphi a town in the province of Thessaly But the news of his defeat at Dyracchium had reached this place before him the inhabitants therefore who had before promised him obedience now changed their minds and with a degree of baseness equal to their imprudence shut their gates against him Caesar was not to be injured with impunity wherefore having represented to his soldiers the great advantage of forcing a place so very rich he ordered the machines for scaling to be got ready and causing an assault to be made proceeded with such vigour  hat notwithstanding the great height of the walls the town was taken in a few hours time Caesar left it to be plundered and without delaying his march went forward to Metropolis another town of the same province which yielded at his approach By this means he soon became possessed of all Thessaly except Larissa which was garrisoned by Scipio with his legion who commanded for Pompey During this interval Pompey's officers continually soliciting their commander to come to a battle and incessantly teasing him with importunities to engage he at length resolved to renounce his own judgment in compliance with those about him and to give up all schemes of prudence for those dictated by avarice and passion Wherefore advancing into Thessaly within a few days after the taking of Gomphi he drew down upon the plains of Pharsalia where he was joined by Scipio his lieutenant with the troops under his command There he wa  ed the coming up of Caesar resolved upon engaging and upon deciding the fate of the kingdoms at a single battle  Caesar had employed all his art for some time in founding the in  inations of his men and finding his array once more resolute and vigorous he caused them to advance towards the plains of Pharsalia where Pompey  was now encamped and prepared to oppose him  The approach of these two great armies composed of the best and bravest troops in the world togethe  with the greatness of the prize for which they contended filled all minds with anxiety though with different expectations Pompey's army being mos  numerous turned all their thoughts to the enjoyment of the victory Caesar's with better aims considered only the means of obtaining it Pompey'  army depended upon their numbers and their man  generals Caesar's upon their own discipline and the conduct of their single commander Pompey'  partizans hoped much from the justice of thei  cause Caesar's alledged the frequent proposals which they had made for peace without effect Thus the views hopes and motives of both seemed different but their hatred and ambition were the same Caesar who was ever foremost in offering battle led out hi  army in array to meet the enemy but Pompey  either suspecting his troops or dreading the event  kept his advantageous situation for some time he drew indeed sometimes out of his camp but al+ways kept himself under his trenches at the foot o  the hill near which he was posted Caesar being unwilling to attack him at a disadvantage resolved t  decamp the next day hoping to harrass out his anta+gonist who was not a match for him in sustainin  the fatigues of duty Accordingly the order fo  marching was given and the tents struck when word was brought him that Pompey's army ha  quitted their entrenchments and had advanced far+ther into the plain than usual so that he might en+gage them at less disadvantage whereupon he caused his troops that were upon their march to halt and with a countenance of joy informed them that the happy time was at last come which they had so long  wished for and which was to crown their glory and  erminate their fatigues Upon this he drew up his  oops in order and advanced towards the place of  attle His forces did not amount to above half those  f Pompey the army of the one amounting to above  ortyfive thousand foot and seven thousand horse  hat of the other not exceeding twentytwo thousand  ot and about a thousand horse This dispropor  on particularly in the cavalry had filled Caesar  ith apprehensions wherefore he had some days be  re picked out the strongest and nimblest of his foot  ldiers and accustomed them to fight between the  nks of his cavalry By their assistance his thou  nd horse was a match for Pompey's seven thousand  d had actually got the better in a skirmish that hap  ned between them some days before  Pompey on the other hand had strong expecta  ons of success he boasted that he could put Caesar's  gions to flight without striking a single blow  esuming that as soon as the armies formed his ca  ry on which he placed his greatest expectations  ould outflank and surround the enemy Labienus  mmended this scheme of Pompey alledging also  at the present troops of which Caesar's army was  mposed were but the shadow of those old legions  at had fought in Britain and Gaul that all the ve  ans were worn out and had been replaced by new  ies made in a hurry in Cisalpine Gaul To  crease the confidence of the army still more he  ok an oath which the rest followed him in never  return to the camp but with victory In this dis  sition and under these advantageous circumstances  mpey led his troops to battle  Pompey's order of battle was good and well judg  In the centre and on the two flanks he placed  his veterans and distributed his newraised troops  tween the wings and the main body The Syrian  gions were placed in the centre under the command  of Scipio the Spaniards on whom he greatl  relied were put on the right under Domitius Aeno+barbus and on the left were stationed the two le+gions which Caesar had restored in the beginning o  the war led on by Pompey himself because from thence he intended to make the attack which was t  gain the day and for the same reason he had ther  assembled all his horse slingers and archers of whic  his right wing had no need being covered by th  river Enipeus Caesar likewise divided his army in+to three bodies under three commanders Domitiu  Calvinus being placed in the centre and Mark An+thony on the left while he himself led on the righ  wing which was to oppose the left commanded by Pompey It is remarkable enough that Pompe  chose to put himself at the head of these troops which were disciplined and instructed by Caesar an incon+testible proof how much he valued them above any o  the rest of his army Caesar on the contrary placed himself at the head of his tenth legion that had owed all its merit and fame to his own training As he observed the enemy's numerous cavalry to be all drawn to one spot he guessed at Pompey's intention  to obviate which he made a draught of six cohort  from his rear line and forming them into a separate body concealed them behind his right wing with instructions not to throw their javelins on the approach of Pompey's horse as was customary but to keep them in their hands and push them directly in the faces and the eyes of the horsemen who being composed of the younger part of the Roman nobility valued themselves much upon their beauty and dreaded a scar in the face more than a wound in the body He lastly placed the little cavalry he had s  as to cover the right of the tenth legion ordering his third line not to march till they had received the signal from him  As the armies approached the two generals went from rank to rank encouraging their men warming their hopes and lessening their apprehensions Pompey represented to his men that the glorious occasion which they had long besought him to grant was now before him "and indeed" cried he  what advantages could you wish over an enemy that you are not now possessed of Your numbers your vigour a late victory all assure a speedy and an easy conquest of those harrassed and broken troops composed of men worn out with age and imprest with the terrors of a recent defeat but there is still a stronger bulwark for our protection than the superiority of our strength the justice of our cause You are engaged in the defence of liberty and of your country you are supported by its laws and followed by its magistrates you have the world spectators of your conduct and wishing you success on the contrary he whom you oppose is a robber and oppressor of his country and almost already sunk with the consciousness of his crimes as well as the bad success of his arms Shew then on this occasion all that ardour and detestation of tyranny that should animate Romans and do justice to mankind  Caesar on his side went among his men with that steady serenity for which he was so much admired in the midst of danger He insisted on nothing so strongly to his soldiers as his frequent and unsuccessful endeavours for peace He talked with terror of the blood he was going to shed and pleaded only the necessity that urged him to it He deplored the many brave men that were to fall on both sides and the wounds of his country whoever should be victorious His soldiers answered his speech with looks of ardour and impatience which observing he gave the signal to begin The word on Pompey's side was Hercules the invincible that on Caesar's Venus the victorious There was only  so much space between both armies as to give root  for fighting wherefore Pompey ordered his men  receive the first shock without moving out of the  places expecting the enemies ranks to be put int  disorder by their motion Caesar's soldiers were no  rushing on with their usual impetuosity when per+ceiving the enemy motionless they all stopt shor  as if by general consent and halted in the midst o  their career A terrible pause ensued in which bot  armies continued to gaze upon each other with mu+tual terror and dreadful serenity at length Caesar  men having taken breath ran furiously upon the ene+my first discharging their javelins and then drawin  their swords The same method was observed b  Pompey's troops who as vigorously sustained the a  +tack His cavalry also were ordered to charge at th  very onset which with the multitude of archers an  flingers soon obliged Caesar's men to give ground  whereupon Caesar immediately ordered the six co+horts that were placed as a reinforcement to ad+vance with orders to strike at the enemies face  This had its desired effect the cavalry that we  but just now sure of victory received an immedia  check the unusal method of sighting pursued by th  cohorts their aiming entirely at the visages of th  assailants and the horrible disfiguring wounds the  made all contributed to intimidate them so muc  that instead of defending their persons their on  endeavour was to save their faces A total rout es+sued of their whole body which fled in great diso  +der to the neighbouring mountains while the arche  and slingers who were thus abandoned were o  to pieces Caesar now commanded the cohorts  pursue their success and advancing charged Pom+pey's troops upon the flank this charge the enem  withstood for some time with great bravery till  brought up his third line which had not yet enga  +ed Pompey's infantry being thus doubly attack  in front by fresh troops and in rear by the victorious cohorts could no longer resist but fled to their camp The flight began among the strangers though Pompey's right wing still valiantly maintained their ground Caesar however being convinced that the victory was certain with his usual clemency cried cut to pursue the strangers but to spare the Romans upon which they all laid down their arms and received quarter The greatest slaughter was among the auxiliaries who fled on all quarters but principally went for safety to the camp The battle had now lasted from the break of day till noon the weather being extremely hot nevertheless the conquerors did not remit their ardour being encouraged by the example of their general who thought his victory not complete till he was master of the enemy's camp Accordingly marching on foot at their head he called upon them to follow and strike the decisive blow The cohorts which were left to defend the camp for some time made a formidable resistance particularly a great number of Thracians and other barbarians who were appointed for its defence but nothing could resist the ardour of Caesar's victorious army they were at last driven from their trenches and all fled to the mountains not far off Caesar seeing the field and camp strewed with his fallen countrymen was strongly affected at so melancholy a prospect and could not help crying out to one that  ood near him "They would have it so" Upon entering the enemies camp every object presented fresh instances of the blind presumption and madness of his adversaries on all sides were to be seen  ents adorned with ivy and branches of myrtle couches covered with purple and sideboards loaded with plate Every thing gave proofs of the highest luxury and seemed rather the preparatives for a banquet the rejoicings for a victory than the dispositions for a battle A camp so richly furnished  might have been able to engage the attention of any troops but Caesar's there was still something to be done and he would not permit them to pursue any other object than their enemies till they were entirely subdued A considerable body of these having retired to the adjacent mountains he prevailed on his soldiers to join him in the pursuit in order to oblige these to surrender He began by inclosing them with a line drawn at the foot of the mountain but they quickly abandoned a post which was not tenable for want of water and endeavoured to reach the city of Larissa Caesar led a part of his army by a shorter way and intercepted their retreat drawing up in order of battle between them and the city However these unhappy fugitives once more found protection from a mountain at the foot of which a rivulet ran which supplied them with water Now night approaching Caesar's men were almost spent and ready to faint with their incessant toil since morning yet still he prevailed upon them once more to renew their labours and to cut off the rivulet that supplied the defendants The sugitives thus deprived of all hopes of succour or subsistence sent deputies to the conqueror offering to surrender at discretion During this interval of negociation a few senators that were among them took the advantage of the night to escape and the rest next morning gave up their arms and experienced the conqueror's clemency In fact he addressed them with great gentleness and forbade his soldiers to offer them any violence or to take any thing from them Thus Caesar by his conduct gained the most complete victory that had ever been obtained and by his great clemency after the battle seemed to have deserved it His loss amounted to but two hundred men that of Pompey to fifteen thousand as well Romans as auxiliaries twentyfour thousand men surrendered themselves prisoners of war and the greatest part of  these entered into Caesar's army and were incorporated with the rest of his forces As to the senators and Roman knights who fell into his hands he generously gave them liberty to retire wherever they thought proper and as for the letters which Pompey had received from several persons who wished to be thought neutral he burnt them all without reading them as Pompey had done upon a former occasion Thus having performed all the duties of a general and a statesman he sent for the legions which had paled the night in the camp to relieve those which had accompanied him in the pursuit and arrived the same day at Larissa  As for Pompey who had formerly shewn such instances of courage and conduct when he saw his cavalry routed on which he had placed his sole dependence he absolutely loft his reason Instead of thinking how to remedy this disorder by rallying such troops as sled or by opposing fresh troops to stop the progress of the conquerors being totally amazed by this first blow he returned to the camp and in his tent waited the issue of an event which it was his duty to direct not to follow there he remained for some moments without speaking till being told that the camp was attacked "What" says he  are we pursued to our very entrenchments  and immediately quitting his armour for a habit more suited to his circumstances he fled away on horseback to Larissa from whence perceiving he was not pursued he slackened his pace g  ing way to all the agonizing reflections which his  eplo  a  situation must naturally suggest In this melancholy manner he passed along the vale of Tempe and pursuing the course of the river Peneus at last arrived at a fisherman's hut in which he passed the night From thence he went on board a little b  k▪ and keeping along the seashore he dise  ed a s  ip of some burthen which seemed preparing  to sail in which he embarked the master of the vessel still paying him the homage which was due to this former station From the mouth of the river Poneus he sailed to Amphipolis where finding his affairs desperate he s  eered to Lesbos to take in his wife Cornelia whom he had left there at a distance from the dangers and hurry of the war She who had long flattered herself with the hopes of victory felt the reverse of her fortune in an agony of distress she was desired by the messenger whose tears more than words proclaimed the greatness of her misfortunes to hasten if she expected to see Pompey with but one ship and even that not his own her grief which before was violent became then insupportable she fainted away and lay a considerable time without any signs of life At length recovering herself and reflecting it was now no time for vain lamentations she ran quite through the city to the seaside Pompey embraced her without speaking a word and for some time supported her in his arms in silent despair  Having taken in Cornelia he now continued his course steering to the southeast and stopping no longer than was necessary to take in provisions at the ports that occurred in his passage He was at last prevailed upon to apply to Ptolemy king of Egypt to whose father Pompey had been a considerable benefactor Ptolemy who was as yet a minor had not the government in his own hands but he and his kingdom were under the direction of Photinus an eunuch and Theodotus a master of the art of speaking These advised that Pompey should be invited on shore and there slain and accordingly Achillas the commander of the forces and Septimius by birth a Roman and who had formerly been a centurion in Pompey's army were appointed to carry their opinions into execution Being attended by three or four more they went into a little  bark and rowed off from land towards Pompey's ship that lay about a mile from the shore Pompey after having taken leave of Cornelia who wept at his departure and having repeated two verses of Sophocles signifying that he who trusts his freedom to a tyrant from that moment becomes a slave gave his hand to Achillas and stept into the bark with only two attendants of his own They had now rowed from the ship a good way and as during that time they all kept a profound silence Pompey willing to begin the discourse accosted Septimius whose face he recollected "Methinks friend" cried he "you and I were once fellowsoldiers together" Septimius gave only a nod with his head without uttering a word or instancing the least civility Pompey therefore took out a paper on which he had minuted a speech he intended to make to the king and began reading it In this manner they approached the shore and Cornelia whose concern had never suffered her to lose sight of her husband began to conceive hope when she perceived the people on the strand crowding down along the coasts as if willing to receive him but her hopes were soon destroyed for that instant as Pompey rose supporting himself upon his freedman's arm Septimius stabbed him in the back and was instantly seconded by Achillas Pompey perceiving his death inevitable only disposed himself to meet it with decency and covering his face with his robe without speaking a word with a sigh resigned himself to his fate At this horrid sight Cornelia shrieked so loud as to be heard to the shore but the danger she herself was in did not allow the mariners time to look on they immediately set sail and the wind proving favourable fortunately they escaped the pursuit of the Egyptian gallies In the mean time Pompey's murderers having cut off his head caused it to be embalmed the better to preserve its features designing  it for a present to Caesar The body was thrown naked on the strand and exposed to the view of all those whose curiosity led them that way However his faithful freedman Philip still kept near it and when the crowd was dispersed he washed it in the sea and looking round for materials to burn it he perceived the wrecks of a fishingboat of which he composed a pile While he was thus piously employed he was accosted by an old Roman soldier who had served under Pompey in his youth  Who art thou  said he  that art making these humble preparations for Pompey's funeral  Philip having answered that he was one of his freedmen "Alas" replied the soldier  permit me to share in this honour also among all the miseries of my exile it will be my last sad comfort that I have been able to assist at the funeral of my old commander and touch the body of the bravest general that ever Rome produced  After this they both joined in giving the corpse the last rites and collecting his ashes buried them under a little rising earth scraped together with their hands over which was afterwards placed the following inscription  He whose merits deserve a temple can now scar  find a tomb  CHAP XXI From the destruction of the Commonwealth to the establishment of the first emperor Augustus U C  CAESAR has been much celebrated for his fortune and yet his abilities seem equal to his highest success He possessed many shining qualities without the intermixture of any defect but that of ambition His talents were such as would have rendered him victorious at the head of any army he commanded  and he would have governed in any republic that had given him birth Having now gained a most complete victory his success only seemed to increase his activity and inspire him with fresh resolution to face new dangers He resolved therefore to pursue his last advantage and follow Pompey to whatever country he should retire convinced that during his life he might gain new triumphs but could never enjoy security  Accordingly losing no time he set sail for Egypt and arrived at Alexandria with about four thousand men a very inconsiderable force to keep such a powerful kingdom under subjection Upon his landing the first accounts he received were of Pompey's miserable end and soon after one of the murderers came with his head and ring as a most grateful present to the conqueror But Caesar had too much humanity to be pleased with such an horrid spectacle he turned away from it with disgust and after a short pause gave vent to his pity in a flood of tears He shortly after ordered a magnificent tomb to be built to his memory on the spot where he was murdered and a temple near the place to Nemesis who was the goddess that punished those that were cruel to men in adversity  It should seem that the Egyptians by this time had same hopes of breaking off all alliance with the Romans which they considered as in fact it was but aspecious subjection They first began to take offence at Caesar's carrying the ensigns of Roman power before him as he entered the city Photinus the eunuch also treated him with great disrespect and even attempted his life Caesar however concealed his resentment till he had a force sufficient to punish his treachery and sending privately for the legions which had been formerly enrolled for Pompey's service as being the nearest to Egypt he in the mean time pretended to repose an entire confidence  in the king's minister making great entertainments and assisting at the conferences of the philosophers who were in great numbers at Alexandria However he soon changed his manner when he found himself in no danger from the minister's attempts and declared that as being Roman consul it was his duty to settle the succession of the Egyptian crown  There were at that time two pretenders to the crown of Egypt Ptolemy the acknowledged king and the celebrated Cleopatra his sister to whom by the custom of the country he also was married and who by his father's will shared jointly in the succession Not being contented with a bare participation of power Cleopatra aimed at governing alone but being opposed in her views by the Roman senate who confirmed her brother's title to the crown she was banished into Syria with Arsinoe her younger sister Caesar gave her new hopes of aspiring to the kingdom and sent to both her and her brother to plead their cause before him Photinus the young king's guardian disdained accepting this proposal and backed his refusal by sending an army of twenty thousand men to besiege him in Alexandria Caesar bravely repulsed the enemy for some time but finding the city of too great extent to be defended by so small an army as he then commanded he retired to the palace which commanded the harbour where he purposed to make his stand Achillas who commanded the Egyptians attacked him there with great vigour and still aimed at making himself master of the fleet that lay before the palace Caesar however too well knew the importance of those ships in the hands of an enemy and therefore burnt them all in spite of every effort to prevent him He next possest himself of the isle of Pharos which was the key to the Alexandrian port by which he was enabled to receive the supplies sent him from all sides  and in this situation he determined to withstand the united force of all the Egyptians  In the mean time Cleopatra having heard of the present turn in her favour resolved to depend rather on Caesar's favour for gaining the government than her own forces But no arts as she justly conceived were so likely to influence Caesar as the charms of her person which though not faultless were yet extremely seducing She was now in the bloom of youth and every feature borrowed grace from the lively turn of her temper To the most enchanting address she joined the most harmonious voice With all these accomplishments she possessed a great share of the learning of the times and could give audience to the ambassadors of seven different nations without an interpreter The difficulty was how to get at Caesar as her enemies were in possession of all the avenues that led to the palace For this purpose she went on board a small vessel and in the evening landed near the palace where being wrapt up in a coverlet she was carried by one Aspolodorus into the very chamber of Cresar Her address at first pleased him her wit and understanding still fanned the flame but her caresses which were carried beyond the bounds of innocence intirely brought him over to second her claims  While Cleopatra was thus employed in forwarding her own views her sister Arsinoe was also strenuously engaged in the camp in pursuing a separate interest She had found means by the assistance of one Ganymede her confident to make a large division in the Egyptian army in her favour and soon after by one of those sudden revolutions which are common in barbarian camps to this day she caused Achillas to be murdered and Ganymede to take the command in his stead and to carry on the siege with greater vigour than before Ganymede's principal  effort was by letting in the sea upon those canals which supplied the palace with fresh water but this inconvenience Caesar remedied by digging a great number of wells His next endeavour was to prevent the junction of Caesar  s twentyfourth legion which he twice attempted in vain He soon after made himself master of a bridge which joined the isle of Pharos to the continent from which post Caesar was resolved to dislodge him In the heat of the action some mariners partly through curiosity and partly ambition came and joined the combatants but being seized with a panic instantly fled and spread a general terror through the army All Caesar's endeavours to rally his forces were in vain the confusion was past remedy and numbers were drowned or put to the sword in attempting to escape Now therefore seeing the irremediable disorder of his troops he retired to a ship in order to get  the palace that was just opposite however he was no sooner on board than great crowds entered at the same time with him upon which apprehensive of the ship's sinking he jumped into the sea and swam two hundred paces to the fleet that lay before the palace all the time holding his own Commentaries in his left hand above water and his coat of mail in his teeth  The Alexandrians finding their efforts to take the palace ineffectual endeavoured at least to get their king out of Caesar's power as he had seized upon his person in the beginning of their disputes For this purpose they made use of their customary arts of dissimulation professing the utmost desire of peace and only wanting the presence of their lawful prince to give a sanction to the treaty Caesar who was sensible of their perfidy nevertheless concealed his suspicions and gave them their king as he was under no apprehensions from the abilities of a boy Ptolemy  however the instant he was set at liberty instead of promoting the peace made every effort to give vigour to his hostilities  In this manner Caesar was hemmed in for some time by this artful and insiduous enemy with all manner of difficulties against him but he was at last re  eved from this mortifying situation by Mithridates Pergamenus one of his most faithful partizans who came with an army to his assistance This general collecting a numerous army in Syria marched into Egypt took the city of Pelusium repulsed the Egyptian army with loss and at last joining with Caesar attacked their camp with a great slaughter of the Egyptians Ptolemy himself attempting to escape on board a vessel that was failing down the river was drowned by the ship's sinking and Caesar thus became master of all Egypt without any farther opposition He therefore appointed Cleopatra with her younger brother who was then but an infant as joint governors according to the intent of their father's will and drove out Arsinoe with Ganymede into banishment  Having thus given away kingdoms he now for a while seemed to relax from the usual activity of his consult captivated with the charms of Cleopatra Instead of quitting Egypt to go and quell the remains of Pompey's party he there abandoned himself to his pleasures passing whole nights in feasting and all the excuses of highwrought luxury with the young queen He even resolved to attend her up the Nile into Aethiopia but the brave veterans who had long followed his fortune boldly reprehended his conduct and refused to be partners in so infamous an expedition Thus at length rouzed from his lethargy he resolved to prefer the call of ambition to that of love and to leave Cleopatra by whom he had a son who was afterwards named Caesario in order to oppose  Pharnces the king of Bosphorus who had made some inroads upon the dominions of Rome  This prince who was the son of the great Mithridates being ambitious of recovering his father's dominions seized upon Armenia and Colchis and overcame Domitius who had been sent against him Upon Caesar's march to oppose him Pharnaces who was as much terrified at the name of the general as at the strength of his army laboured by all the arts of negociation to avert the impending danger Caesar exasperated at his crimes and ingratitude a  first dissembled with the ambassadors and using all expedition fell upon the enemy unexpectedly and in a few hours obtained a speedy and complete victory Pharnaces attempting to take refuge in his capital was slain by one of his own commanders A just punishment for his former parricide But Caesar conquered him with so much ease that in writing to a friend at Rome he exprest the rapidity of his victory in three words  "Veni vidi vici"  man so accustomed to conquest thought a slight battle scarce worth a longer letter  Caesar having settled affairs in this part of the empire as well as time would permit embarked for Italy where he arrived sooner than his enemies could expect but not before his affairs there absolutely required his presence He had been during his absence created consul for five years dictator for one year and tribune of the people for life But Anthony who in the mean time governed in Rome for him had filled the city with riot and debaucher  and many commotions ensued which nothing but the arrival of Caesar so opportunely could appeased However by his moderation and humanity he soon restored tranquility to the city scarce making any distinction between those of his own and the opposite party Having by gentle means restored his authority  at home he prepared to march into Africa where Pompey's party had found time to rally under Scipio and Cato assisted by Juba king of Mauritania and with his usual diligence landed with a small party in Africa while the rest of his army followed him Scipio coming to a battle soon after received a complete and final overthrow with little or no loss on the side of the victor Juba and Petreius his general killed each other in despair Scipio attempting to escape by sea into Spain fell in among the enemy and was slain so that of all the generals of that undone party Cato was now the only one that remained  This extraordinary man whom no prosperity could fate nor no misfortune depress having retired into Africa after the battle of Pharsalia had led the wretched remains of that defeat through burning deserts and tracts infested with serpents of various malignity and was now in the city of Utica which he had been left to defend Still however in love with even the shew of Roman government he had formed the principal citizens into a senate and conceived a resolution of holding out the town But the enthusiasm for liberty subsiding among his followers he was resolved no longer to force men to be free who seemed naturally prone to slavery He now therefore desired some of his friends to save themselves  sea and bade others to rely upon Caesar's clemency observing that as to himself he was at  victorious After this supping chearfully among  is friends he retired to his apartment where he behaved with unusual tenderness to his son and to  his friends When he came into his bedchamber he laid himself down and took up Plato's  logue on the immortality of the soul and hav  ng read for some time happening to cast his eyes  the head of his bed he was much surprized not  had his sword there which had been taken away  by his son's order while they were at supper Upon this calling one of his domestics to know what was become of his sword and receiving no answer he resumed his studies but some time after called for his sword again When he had done reading and perceiving nobody obeyed him in bringing his sword he called his domestics one after the other and with a peremptory air demanded his sword once more His son came in soon after and with tears besought him in the most humble manner to change his resolution but receiving a stern reprimand he desisted from his persuasions His sword being at length brought him he seemed sati  fied and cried out "Now again I am m  ster of myself" He then took up the book again which he lead twice over and fell into a sound sleep Upon awaking he called to one of his freedmen to know if his friends were embarked or if any thing yet remained that could be done to serve them The freedmen assuring him that all was quiet he was then ordered again to leave the room and Cato was no sooner alone than he stabbed himself with his sword through the breast but not with that force he intended for the wound not dispatching him he fell upon his bed and at the same time overturned a table on which he had been drawing some geometrical figures At the noise he made in his fall his servants gave a shrick  and his son and friends immediately entered the room They found him westering in his blood and his bowels pushed out through the wound The physician who attended his family perceiving than his intestines were yet untouched was for replacing them but when Cato had recovered his senses and understood their intention to preserve his life he pushed the physician from him and with a fierce resolution tore out his bowels and  xpired  Upon the death of Cato the war in Africa being completed Caesar returned in triumph to Rome  and as if he had abridged all his former triumphs only to encrease the splendor of this the citizens were astonished at the magnificence of the procession and the number of the countries he had subdued It lasted four days the first was for Gaul the second for Egypt the third for his victories in Asia and the fourth for that over Juba in Africa His veteran soldiers all scarred with wounds and now laid up for life followed their triumphant general crowned with laurels and conducted him to the Capitol To every one of these he gave a sum equivalent to about an hundred and fifty pounds of our money double that sum to the centurions and four times as much to the superior officers The citizens also shared his bounty to every one of which he distributed ten bushels of corn ten pounds of oil and a sum of money equal to about two pounds sterling of ours He after this entertained the people at above twenty thousand tables treated them with the combat of gladiators and filled Rome with a concourse of spectators from every part of Italy  The people intoxicated with the allurements of pleasure thought their freedom too small a return for such benefits they seemed eager only to find out new modes of homage and unusual epithets of adulation for their great enslaver He was created by a new title  Magister Morum  or master of the morals of the people he received the title of emperor father of his country his person was declared sacred and in short upon him alone were devolved for life all the great dignities of the state It must be owned however that so much power could never have been entrusted to b  tter keeping He immediately began his empire by repressing vice and encouraging virtue He comm  tted the power of judicature to the senators and the knights alone and by many sumptuary laws  scandalous luxuries of the rich He  proposed rewards to all such as had many children and took the most prudent methods of repeopling the city that had been exhausted in the late commotions  Having thus restored prosperity once more to Rome he again found himself under a necessity of going into Spain to oppose an army which had been raised there under the two sons of Pompey and also Labicnus his former general He proceeded in this expedition with his usual celerity and arrived in Spain before the enemy thought him yet departed from Rome Cneius and Sextus Pompey's sons profiting by their unhappy father's example resolved as much as possible to protract the war so that the first operations of the two armies were spent in sieges and fruitless attempts to surprise each other▪ At length Caesar after taking many cities from the enemy and pursuing Pompey with unwearied perseverance at last compelled him to come to a battle upon the plains of Munda Pompey drew up his men by break of day upon the declivity of an hill with great exactness and order Caesar drew up his men likewise in the plain below and after advancing a little way from his trenches he ordered his men to make an halt expecting the enemy to come down from the hill This delay made Caesar's soldiers begin to murmur while Pompey's with full vigour poured down upon them and a dreadful conflict ensued The first shock was so dreadful that Caesar's men who had hitherto been used to conquer now began to waver Caesar was never in so much danger as now he threw himself several times into the very throng of battle "What" cried he  are you going to give up your general who is grown grey in fighting at your head to a parcel of boy  Upon this his tenth legion exerted themselves with more than former bravery and a party of horse being detached by Labienus from the camp in  pursuit of a body of Numidian cavalry Caesar cried aloud that they were flying This cry instantly spread itself through both armies exciting the one as much as it depressed the other Now therefore the tenth legion pressed forward and a total rout soon ensued Thirty thousand men were killed on Pompey's side amongst whom was Labienus whom Caesar ordered to be buried with the funeral honours of a general officer Cneius Pompey escaped with a few horsemen to the seaside but finding his passage intercepted by Caesar's lieutenant he was obliged to seek for a retreat in an obscure cavern He was quickly discovered by some of Caesar's troops who presently cut off his head and brought it to the conqueror His brother Sextus however concealed himself so well that he escaped all pursuit and afterwards became very noted and formidable from his piracies to the people of Rome  Caesar by this last blow subdued all his avowed enemies and the rest of his life was employed for the advantage of the state He adorned the city with magnificent buildings he rebuilt Carthage and Corinth sending colonies to both cities he undertook to level several mountains in Italy to drain the Pontine marshes near Rome and designed to cut through the isthmus of Peloponnesus Thus with a mind that could never remain inactive he pondered mighty projects and designs beyond the limits of the longest life but the greatest of all was his intended expedition against the Parthians by which he designed to revenge the death of Crassus who having penetrated too far into their country was overthrown himself taken prisoner and put to a cruel death by having molten gold poured down his throat as a punishment for his former avarice From thence Caesar intended to pass through Hyrcania and enter Scythia along the banks of the Caspian sea then to open himself a way through the  immeasurable forests of Germany into Gaul and so to return to Rome These were the aims of ambition the jealousy of a few individuals put an end to them all  Having been made perpetual dictator and received from the senate accumulated honours it began to be rumoured that he intended to make himself king and though in fact he was possessed of the power the people who had an utter aversion to the name  could not bea  his assuming the title Whether he really designed to assume that empty honour must now for ever remain a secret but certain it is that the unsuspecting openness of his conduct marked something like a confidence in the innocence of his intentions When informed by those about him of the jealousies of many persons who envied his power he was heard to say that he had rather die once by treason than to live continually in apprehension of it When advised by some to beware of Brutus in whom he had for some time reposed the greatest confidence he opened his breast all scarred with wounds saying  Can you think Brutus cares for such poor pillage as this  and being one night at supper as his friends disputed among themselves what death was easiest he replied that which was most sudden and least foreseen But to convince the world how little he had to apprehend from his enemies he disbanded his company of Spanish guards which facilitated the enterprize against his life  A deep conspiracy was therefore laid against him composed of no less than sixty senators They were still the more formidable as the generality of them were of his own party who having been raised above other citizens felt more strongly the weight of a single superior At the head of this conspiracy were Brutus whose life Caesar had spared after the battle of Pharsalia and Cassius who was pardoned  soon after both praetors for the present year Brutus made it his chief glory to have been descended from that Brutus who first gave liberty to Rome The passion for freedom seemed to have been transmitted with the blood of his ancestors down to him But though he detested tyranny yet he could not forbear loving the tyrant from whom he had received the most signal benefits  The conspirators to give a colour of justice to their proceedings remitted the execution of their design to the ides of March the day on which Caesar was to be offered the crown The augurs had foretold that this day would be fatal to him and the night preceding he heard his wise Calpurnia lamenting in her sleep and being awakened she confessed to him that she dreamt of his being assassinated in her arms These omens in some measure began to change his intentions of going to the senate as he had resolved that day but one of the conspirators coming in prevailed upon him to keep his resolution telling him of the reproach that would attend his  taying at home till his wife had lucky dreams and of the preparations that were made for his appearance As he went along to the senate a slave who hastened to him with information of the conspiracy attempted to come near him but could not for the crowd Arternidorus a Greek philosopher who had discovered the whole plot delivered him a memorial containing the heads of his information but Caesar gave it with other papers to one of his secretaries without reading as was usual in things of this nature Being at length entered the senatehouse where the conspirators were prepared to receive him he met one Spurina an augur who had foretold his danger to whom he said smiling  Well Spurina the ides of March are come  "Yes" replied the augur "but they are not yet over" As soon as he had taken his place the conspirators came  near him under pretence of saluting him and Cim+ber who was one of them approached in a sup+pliant posture pretending to sue for his brother pardon who had been banished by his order A  the conspirators seconded him with great earnestness and Cimber seeming to sue with still greater sub+mission took hold of the bottom of his robe holding him so as to prevent his rising This was the signa  agreed on Casca who was behind stabbed him though slightly in the shoulder Caesar instantly turn+ed round and with the steel of his tablet wounde  him in the arm However all the conspirators were now alarmed and inclosing him round he received a second stab from an unknown hand in the breast while Cassius wounded him in the face He still defended himself with great vigour rushing among them and throwing down such as opposed him till he saw Brutus among the conspirators who coming up struck his dagger into his thigh From that moment Caesar thought no more of defending himself but looking upon this conspirator cried out "And you too my son" Then covering his head and spreading his robe before him in order to fall with greater decency he sunk down at the base of Pompey's statue after receiving three and twenty wounds from hands which he vainly supposed he had disarmed by his benefits  U C  Caesar was killed in the fiftysixth year of his age and about fourteen years after he began the conquest of the world If we examine his history we shall be equally at a loss whether most to admire his great abilities or his wonderful fortune▪ To pretend to say that from the beginning he planned the subjection of his native country is doing no great credit to his wellknown penetration as a thousand obstacles lay in his way which fortune rather than conduct▪ was to surmount No man therefore of his sagacity would have begun a scheme in  which the chances of succeeding were so many against him it is most probable that like all very succesful men he only made the best of every occurrence and his ambition rising with his good fortune from at first being contented with humbler aims he at last began to think of governing the world when he found scarce any obstacle to oppose his designs Such is the disposition of man whose cravings after power are always most insatiable when he enjoys the greatest share  As soon as the conspirators had dispatched Caesar they all retired to the Capitol and guarded its acc  sses by a body of gladiators which Brutus had in pay  The friends of the late dictator now began to find that this was the time for coming into greater power than before and for satisfying their ambition under the veil of promoting justice Of this number was Antony whom we have already seen acting as a lieutenant under Caesar and governing Rome in his absence He was a man of moderate abilities and excessive vices ambitious of power only because it gave his pleasures a wider range to riot in but skilled in war to which he had been trained from his youth He was consul for this year and resolved with Lepidus who was fond of commotions like himself to seize this opportunity of gaining that power which Caesar had died for usurping Lepidus therefore took possession of the Forum with a band of soldiers at his devotion and Antony being consul was permitted to command them Their first step was to possess themselves of all Caesar's papers and money and the next to convene the senate Never had this august assembly been convened upon so delicate an occasion as it was to determine whether Caesar had been a legal magistrate or a tyrannical usuper and whether those who killed him merited rewards or punishments There were many of these who had  received all their promotions from Caesar and had acquired large fortunes in consequence of his appointments to vote him an usurper therefore would be to endanger their property and yet to vote him innocent might endanger the state In this dilemma they seemed willing to reconcile extremes wherefore they approved all the acts of Caesar and yet granted a general pardon to all the conspirators  This decree was very far from giving Anthony satisfaction as it granted security to a number of men who were the avowed enemies of tyranny and who would be foremost in opposing his schemes of restoring absolute power As therefore the senate had ratified all Caesar's acts without distinction he formed a scheme upon this of making him rule when dead as imperiously as he bad done when living Being as was said possessed of Caesar's books of accounts he so far gained upon his secretary as to make him insert whatever he thought proper By these means great sums of money which Caesar would never have bestowed were there distributed among the people and every man who had any seditious designs against the government was there sure of finding a gratuity Things being in this situation Antony demanded of the senate that Caesar's funeral obsequies should be performed which they could not decently forbid as they had never declared him a tyrant accordingly the body was brought forth into the Forum with the utmost solemnity and Antony who charged himself with these last duties of friendship began his operations upon the passions of the people by the prevailing motives of private interest He first read them Caesar's will in which he had left Octavius his sister's grandson his heir permitting him to take the name of Caesar and three parts of his private fortune and Brutus was to inherit in case of his death The Roman people were  left the gardens which he had on the other side of the Tyber and every citizen in particular was to receive three hundred sesterces and unfolding Caesar's bloody robe in sight of the multitude he took care they should observe the number of stabs in it then displayed an image which to them appeared the body of Caesar all covered with wounds They could no longer contain their indignation but unanimously cried out for revenge and ran with flaming brands from the pile to set fire to the conspirators houses In this rage of resentment meeting with one Cinna whom they mistook for another of the same name who was in the conspiracy they tore him in pieces The conspirators themselves however being well guarded repulsed the multitude with no great trouble but perceiving the rage of the people they thought it soon after safest to retire from the city  In the mean time Anthony who had excited this f  ame resolved to make the best of the occasion But  n obstacle to his ambition seemed to arise from a quarter on which he least expected it namely from Octavius Caesar after  ards called Augustus who was the grand nephew and adopted son of Caesar A third competitor also for power appeared in Lepidus a man of some authority and great riches at Rome At first the ambition of these once seemed to threaten fatal consequences to each other but uniting soon after in the common cause they resolved to revenge the death of Caesar and dividing all power among themselves formed what is called the second Triumvirate  The meeting of these three usurpers of their country's freedom was near Mutina upon a little island of the river Panarus Their mutual suspicions were the cause o  their meeting in a place where they could not fear any treachery for even in their union they could not divest themselves of mutual  dissidence Lepidus first entered and finding all things safe made the signal for the other two to approach They embraced each other upon their first meeting and Augustus began the conference by thanking Antony for his zeal in putting Decimus Brutus to death who being abandoned by his army was taken as he was designing to escape into Macedonia and beheaded by Antony's command They then entered upon the business that lay before them without any retrospection of the past Their conference lasted for three days and in this period they fixed a division of government and determined upon the fate of thousands The result of which was that the supreme authority should be lodged in their hands under the title of the Triumvirate for the space of five years that Antony should have Gaul Lepidus Spain and Augustus Africa and the Mediterranean islands As for Italy and the eastern provinces they were to remain in common until their general enemy was entirely subdued where among other articles of union it was agreed that all their enemies should be destroyed of which each presented a list In these were comprised not only the enemies but the friends of the Triumvirate since the partizans of the one were often found among the opposers of the other Thus Lepidus gave up his brother Paulus to the vengeance of his colleague Antony permitted the proscription of his uncle Lucius and Augustus delivered up the great Cicero who was assassinated shortly after by Antony's command  In the mean time Brutus and Cassius the principal of the conspirators against Caesar being compelled to quit Rome went into Greece where they persuaded the Roman students at Athens to declare in the cause of freedom then parting the forme  raised a powerful army in Macedonia and the adja+cent countries while the latter went into Syria  where he soon became master of twelve legions and reduced his opponent Dollabella to such streights as to kill himself Both armies soon after joining at Smyrna the fight of such a formidable force began to revive the declining spirits of the party and to reunite the two generals still more closely between whom there had been some time before a slight misunderstanding In short having quitted Italy like distressed exiles without having one single soldier or one town that owned their command they now found themselves at the head of a flourishing army furnished with all the necessaries for carrying to the war and in a condition to support a contest where the empire of the world depended on the event This success in raising levies was entirely owing to the justice moderation and great humanit  of Brutus who in every instance seemed stu  s of the happiness of his country and not his    It was in this flourishing state of their affairs that  tors had formed a resolution of going  Cleopatra who had made great preparations  their opponents However they were divert  from this purpose by an information that Augustus  Antony were now upon their march with forty  to oppose them Brutus therefore moved  their army pass over into Greece and Mace  ni  and there meet the enemy but Callius so far  is to have the Rhodians and Lycians first re  ed who had refused their usual contributions  exped  ion was immediately put in execution  extraor  nary contributions were raised by that  eans the Rhodians having scarce any thing lest them but their lives The Lycians suffered still more severely for having shut themselves up in the  or Nalithius they defended the place against  rutus with such fury that neither his arts nor entreaties could prevail upon them to surrender At  length the town being set on fire by their attempting to burn the works ot the Romans Brutus instead of laying hold on this opportunity to storm the place made every effort to preserve it entreating his soldiers to try all means of extinguishing the fire  but the desperate phrenzy of the citizens was not to be mollified Far from thinking themselves obliged to their generous enemy for the efforts which were made to save them they resolved to perish in the flames Wherefore instead of extinguishing they did all in their power to augment the fire by throwing in wood dry reeds and all kinds of fuel Nothing could exceed the distress of Brutus upon seeing the townsmen thus resolutely bent on destroying themselves▪ he rode about the fortifications stretching out his hands to the Nanthians and conjuring then to have pity on themselves and their city but insensi  le to his ex  ostulations they rushed into the flames with desperate obstinacy and the whole soon became an heap of undistinguishable ruin At this horrid spectacle Brutus melted into tears offering a reward to every soldier who should bring him a Lycian alive The number of those whom it was possible to save from their own fury amounted to no more than one hundred and fifty  Brutus and Callius met once more at Sardis where after the usual ceremonies were past between them they resolved to have private conference together They shut themselves up therefore in the first convenient house with express orders to their servants to give no admission Brutus began by reprimanding Cassius for having disposed of offices which should ever be the reward of merit and for having overtaxed the tributary states Cassius retorted the imputation of avarice with the more bitterness as he knew the chan  e to be groundless The debate grew warm till from loud speaking they burst into fears Their friends who were standing at the door  overheard the increasing vehemence of their voices and began to dread for the consequences till Favonius who valued himself upon a cynical boldness t  t knew no restraint entering the room with a j  st calmed their mutual animosity Cassius was ready enough to forego his anger being a man of great abilities but of uneven disposition not averse to pleasure in private company and upon the wh  le of morals not quite sincere But the conduct of Brutus was always perfectly steady An even gentl  ness a noble elevation of sentiments a strength of mind over which neither vice nor pleasure could have any influence an inflexible firmness in the def  ce of justice composed the character of that great m  n After their conference night coming on Cassius invited Brutus and his friends to an entertainment where freedom and chearfulness for a v  lle  ok place of political anxiety and softened the severity of wisdom Upon retiring home it was that Brutus as Plutarch tells the story saw a spectre in his tent He naturally slept but little and he had increased this state of watchfulness by habit and great sobriety He never allowed himself to sleep in the day time as was then common in Rome and only gave so much of the night to sleep as could barely renew the natural functions But especially now when opprest with such various cares he only gave a short time after his nightly repast to rest and waking about midnight generally read or studied still morning It was in the dead of the night when the whole camp was perfectly quiet that Brutus was thus employed in reading by a lamp that was just expiring On a sudden he thought he heard a noise as if some body entered and lookin  towards the door he perceived it open A gigantic figure with a frightful aspect stood before him and continued to gaze upon him with silent severity At last Brutus had courage to speak to it "Art thou a daemon or  a mortal man and why cornest thou to me" "Brutus" replied the phantom  I am thy evil genius thou shalt see me again at Philippi  "Well then" answered Brutus without being discomposed "we shall meet again" Upon which the phantom vanished and Brutus calling to his servants asked if they had seen any thing to which replying in the negative he again resumed his studies But as he was struck with so strange an occurrence he mentioned it the next day to Cassius who being an Epicurean ascribed it to the effect o  an imagination too much exercised by vigilance and anxiety Brutus appeared satisfied with this solution of his late terrors and as Antony and Augustus were now advanced into Macedonia he and his colleague passed over into Thrace and drew near to the city of Philippi where the forces of the triumviri were posted to receive them  All mankind now began to regard the approaching armies with terror and suspense The empire of the world depended upon the fate of a battle as from victory on the one side they had to expect freedom▪ but from the other a sovereign with absolute command Brutus was the only man who looked upon these great events before him with calmness and tr  nqu  lity Indifferent as to success and satisfied with having done his duty he said to one of his friends  If I gain the victory I shall restore liberty to my country if I lose it by dying I shall be delivered from slavery myself my condition is fixed and I run no hazards  The republican army consisted of fourscore thousand foot and twenty thousand horse The army of the triumviri amounted to an hundred thousand foot and thirteen thousand horse Thus complete on both sides they met and encamped near each other upon the plains of Philippi a city upon the confines of Thrace This city was situated upon a mountain towards the west  of which a plain stretched itself by a gentle declivity almost fifteen leagues to the banks of the river Saymon In this p  ain about two miles from the town were two little hills at about a mile distance from each other defended on one side by mountains on the other by a marsh which communicated with the sea It was upon these two hills that Brutus and C  ssius fixed their camys Brutus on the hill towards the north Cassius on that towards the south and in the intermediate space which separated them they cast up lines and a parapet from one hill to the other That they kept a firm communication between the two camps which mutually defended each other In this commodious situation they could act as they thought proper and give battle only when it was thought to their advantage to engage Behind them was the sea which furnished them with all kinds of provisions and at twelve miles distance the island of Thasos which served them for a general magazine The triumviri on the other hand were encamped on the plain below and were obliged to bring their provisions from fifteen leagues distance so that their scheme and interest was to bring on a battle as soon as they could This they offered several times drawing out their men from their camp and provoking the enemy to engage On the contrary these contented themselves with drawing up their troops at the head of their camps but without descending to the plain This resolution of postponing the battle was all that the republican army had for it and Cassius who was aware of his advantage resolved to harrass the enemy rather than engage them But Brutus began to suspect the fidelity of s  me of his officers so that he used all his instance to persuade Cassius to change his resolution "I am impatient" said he  to put an end to the  of mankind and in that I have hopes of succeeding whether I fall or conquer  His wishes  were soon gratified for Antony's soldiers having with great labour made a road through the marsh which lay to the left of Cassius's camp by that means opened a communication with the island of Thasos which lay behind him Both armies in attempting to possess themselves of this road resolved at length to come to a general engagement This however  contrary to the advice of Cassius who declared th  t  e was  ced as Pompey had formerly been to  of Rome to the hazard of a battle  morning the two generals gave the signal  en  aging and conferred together a little while before the battle began Cassius desired to kn  w n  w Brutus intended to act in case they were unsuccessful to which the other replied  That he had formerly in his writings condemned the death of Ca  o and maintained that avoiding calamities by suicide was an insolent attempt against Heaven that sent them but he had now altered his o  inions and having given up his life to his country he thought he had a right to his own way of ending it wherefore he was resolved to change a miserable being here for a better hereafter if fortune proved against him  Well said "my friend" cried Cassius embracing him  now we may venture to face the enemy for either we shall conquerors ourselves or we shall have no cause to fear those that are so  Augustus being sick the forces of the triumviri were commanded  one by Antony who began the engagement by a vigorous attack upon the lines of Cassius Brutus on the other side made a dreadful erruption on the prior of Augustus and drove forward with so much intrepidity that he broke them upon the very first  Upon this he penetrated as far as the camp and cutting in pieces those who were left for its defence his troops immediately began to plunder but in the mean time the lines of Cassius were forced  and his cavalry put to flight There was no effort that this unfortunate general did not use to make his infantry stand stopping those that fled and seizing himself the colours to rally them But his own valour alone was not sufficient to inspire his timorous army wherefore despairing of success he caused himself to be slain by one of his freedmen Brutus was soon informed of the defeat of Cassius and soon after of his death as he drew near the camp He seemed scarce able to restrain the excess of his grief for a man whom he called the last of the Romans  But his first care when he became the sole general was to assemble the disperst troops of Cassius and animate them with fresh hopes of victory As they had lost all they possest by the plundering of their camp he promised them two thousand denarii each man to make up their losses This once more inspired them with new ardour they admired the liberality of their general and with loud shouts proclaimed his former intrepidity Still however he had not confidence sufficient to face the adversary who off  ed him battle the ensuing day His aim was to starve his enemies who were in extreme war  provisions their fleet having been lately defe  d But his single opinion was overruled by  his army who now grew every day more confident of their strength and more arrogant to their n  w general He was therefore at last after inspi  of twenty days obliged to comply with their sollicitations to try the fate of the battle Both armies  ing  rawn out they remained a long while opposite to each other without offering to engage But it is  that he himself had lost much of his natur  d ardour by having seen a spectre the night preceding h  wever he encouraged his men us much as possible and gave the signal for another battle He had as usual the advantage where he commanded in person bearing down the enemy at the head of h  s infantry and supported by his cavalry  making a very great slaughter But the troops which had belonged to Cassius communicating their terror to the rest of the forces at last the whole army gave way Brutus surrounded by the most valiant of his officers fought for a long time with amazing valour The son of Cato fell fighting by his side as also the brother of Cassius so that at last he was obliged to yield to necessity and fled In the mean time the two triumviri now assured of victory expresly ordered by no means to suffer the general to escape for fear he should renew the war Thus the whole body of the enemy seemed chiefly intent on Brutus alone and his capture seemed inevitable In this deplorable exigence Lucilius his friend was resolved by his own death to effect his general's delivery Upon perceiving a body of Thracian horse closely pursuing Brutus and just upon the point of taking him he boldly threw himself in their way telling them that he was Brutus The Thracians overjoyed with so great a prize immediately dispatched some of their companions with the news of their success to the army Upon which the ardour of the pursuit now abating Antony marched out to meet his prisoner and to hasten his death or insult his misfortunes He was followed by a great number of officers and soldiers some silently deploring the fate of so virtuous a man others reproaching that mean desire of life for which he consented to undergo captivity Antony now seeing the Thracians approach began to prepare himself for the interview but the faithful Lucilius advancing with a chearful air "It is not Brutus" said he  that is taken fortune has not yet had the power of committing so great an outrage upon virtue As for my life it is well spent in preserving his honour take it for I have deceived you  Antony struck with so much fidelity pardoned him upon the spot and from that time forward loaded him with benefits and honoured him with his friendship  In the mean time Brutus with a small number of friends passed over a rivulet and night coming on set down under a rock which concealed him from the pursuit of the enemy After taking breath for a little time and casting his eyes up to Heaven he repeated a line from Euripides containing a wish to the Gods  that guilt should not pass in this life without punishment  To this he added another from the same poet  O Virtue thou empty name I have worshipped thee as a real good but thou art only the slave of Fortune  He then called to mind with great tenderness those whom he had  een perish in battle and sent out one Statilius to give him some information of those that remained but he never returned being killed by a party of the enemy's horse Brutus judging very rightly of his site now resolved to die likewise and spoke to  ose who stood round him to lend him their last sad  None of them however would render him to melancholy a service He therefore called  ne of his  laves to perform what he so ardently desired but Strato his tutor offered himself crying    that it should never be said that Brutus in in  last extremity stood in need of a slave for want of a friend  Thus saying and averting his head represented the sword's point to Brutus who threw himself upon it and immediately expired  From the moment of Brutus's death the triumviri began to act as sovereigns and to divide the Roman dominions between them as theirs by right of conquest However though there were apparently  ree who participated all power yet in fact only two were actually possest of it since Lopidus was at first admitted merely to curb the mutual jealousy of Antony and Augustus and was possest neither of interest in the army nor authority among the people Their fir  t care was to punish those whom they had formerly marked for vengeance Hortensius Drusus  and Quintilius Varus all men of the first rank in the commonwealth either killed themselves or were slain A senator and his son were ordered to cast lots for their lives but both refused it the father voluntarily gave himself up to the executioner and the son stabbed himself before his face Another begged to have the rites of burial after his death to which Augustus replied  that he should find a grave in the vultures that devoured him  But chiefly the people lamented to see the head of Brutus sent to Rome to be thrown at the foot of Caesar's statue His ashes however were sent to his wife Porcia Cato's daughter who following the example of her husband and father killed herself by swallowing burning coals It is observed that of all those who had a hand in the death of Caesar not one died a natural death  The power of the triumviri being thus established upon the ruin of the commonwealth they now began to think of enjoying that homage to which they had aspired Antony went into Greece to receive the flattery of that refined people and spent some time at Athens conversing among the philosophers and assisting at their disputes in person From thence he past over into Asia where all the monarchs of the East who acknowledged the Roman power came to pay him their obedience while the fairest princesses strove to gain his favour by the greatness of their presents or the allurements of their beauty In this manner he proceeded from kingdom to kingdom attended by a crowd of sovereigns exacting contributions distributing favours and giving away crowns with ca  ricious insolence He presented the kingdom of Canpadocia to Sysenes in prejudice of Ariarathes only because he found pleasure in the beauty of G  aphyra the mother of the former He settled Herod in the kingdom of Judea and supported him against every opposer But among all the sovereigns  of the East who shared his favours none had so large a part as Cleopatra the celebrated queen of Egypt  It happened that Serapion her governor in the island of Cyprus had formerly furnished some succours to the conspirators and it was thought proper that he should answer for his conduct on that occasion Accordingly having received orders from Antony to come and clear herself of this imputation of infidelity she readily complied equally conscious of the goodness of her cause and the power of her beauty She was now in her twentyseventh year and consequently had improved those allurements by art which in earlier age are seldom attended to Her address and wit were still further heightened and though there were some women in Rome that were her equals in beauty none could rival her in the charms of seducing conversation Antony was now in Tarsus a city of Cilicia when Cleopatra resolved to attend his court in person She sailed to meet him down the river Cydnus at the mouth of which the city stood with the most sumptuous pageantry Her galley was covered with gold the sails of purple large and floating in the wind The oars of silver kept time to the sound of flutes and cymbals She herself lay reclined on a couch spangled with stars of gold and with such ornaments as poets and painters had usually ascribed to Venus On each side were boys like Cupids who famed her by turns while the most beautiful nymphs drest like Noriads and Graces were placed at proper distances around her Upon the banks of the river were kept burning the most exquisite perfumes while an infinite number of people gazed upon the si  ht with a mixture of delight and admiration Antony was captivated with her beauty and leaving all his  usiness to satisfy his passion shortly after followed her into Egypt There he continued in  all that ease and softness to which his vicious heart was prone and which that luxurious people were able to supply  While he remained thus idle in Egypt Augustus who took upon him to lead back the veteran troops and settle them in Italy was assiduously employed in providing for their subsistence He had promised them lands at home as a recompence for their past services but they could not receive their new grants without turning out the former inhabitants In consequence of this multitudes or women with children in their arms whose tender years and innocence excited universal compassion daily filled the temples and the streets with their distresses Numbers of husbandmen and shepherds came to deprecate the conqueror's intention or to obtain an habitation in some other part of the world Among this number was Virgil the poet to whom mankind owe more obligations than to a thousand conquerors who in an humble manner begged permission to retain his patrimonial farm Virgil obtained his request but the rest of his countrymen of Mantua and Cremona were turned out without mercy  Italy and Rome now felt the most extreme miseries the insolent soldiers plundered at will while Sextus Pompey being master of the sea cut off all foreign communication and prevented the people's receiving their usual supplies of corn To these mischiefs were added the commencement of another civil war Pulvia the wife of Antony who had been left behind him at Rome had felt for some time a  l the rage of jealousy and resolved to try every method of bringing back her husband from the arms of Cleopatra She considered a breach with Augustus as the only probable means of rouzing him from his lethargy and accordingly with the assistance of Lucius her brother inlaw who was then consul and entirely devoted to her interest she  began to sow the seeds of dissension The pretext was that Antony should have a share in the distribution of lands as well as Augustus This produced negociations between them and Augustus offered to make the veterans themselves umpires in the dispute Lucius refused to acquiesce and being at the head of more than six legions mostly composed of such as were dispossest he resolved to compel Augustus to accept of whatever terms he should offer Thus a new war was excited between Augustus and Antony on at least the generals of the latter assumed the sanction of his name Augustus however was victorious Lucius was hemmed in between two armies and const  ained to retreat to Perusia a city of Etruria where he was closely besieged by the oppo  ite party He made many desperate sallies and Fulvia did all in her power to relieve him but without success He was at last therefore reduced to such extremity by famine that he came out in person and delivered himself up to the mercy of the conqueror Augustus received him very honouraly and generously pardoned him and all his followers  Antony having heard of his brother's overthrow and his wife's being compelled to leave Italy was resolved to oppose Augustus without delay He accordingly sailed at the head of a considerable fleet from Alexandria to Tyre and from thence to Cypius and Rhodes and had an interview with Fulvia  were at Athens He much blamed her for occasioning the late disorders testified the utmost contempt for her person and leaving her upon her ce  rbed at  ycion hastened into Italy to sight Augustus They both met at Brandusium and it was now thought that the flames of a civilwar were going to blaze out once more The forces of Antony were numerous but mostly new raised however he was assisted by Sextus Pompeius who in  these oppositions of interest was daily coming into power Augustus was at the head of those veterans who had always been irresistible but who seemed no way disposed to fight against Antony their former general A negociation was therefore proposed and by the activity of Cocceius a friend to both a reconciliation was effected All offences and affronts were mutually forgiven and to cement the union a marriage was concluded between Antony and Octavia the sister of Augustus A new division of the Roman empire was made between them Augustus was to have the command of the West Antony of the East while Lepidus was obliged to content himself with the provinces in Africa As for Sextus Pompeius he was permitted to retain all the islands he had already possest together with Peloponnesus he was also granted the privilege of demanding the consulship in his absence and of discharging that office by any of his friends It was likewi  e stipulated to leave the sea open and pay the people what corn was due out of Sicily Thus a gene  al peace was concluded to the great satisfaction of the people who now expected a cessation from all their calamities  This calm seemed to continue for sometime Antony led his forces against the Parthians over whom his lientenant Ventidius had gained some advantages Augustus drew the greatest part of his army into Gaul where there were some disturbances and Pompey went to secure his newly ceded province to his interest It was on this quarter that fresh motives were given for renewing the war Antony who was obliged by treaty to quit Peloponnesus refused to evacuate it till Pompey had satisfied him for such debts as were due to him from the inhabitants This Pompey would by no means comply with but immediately fitted out a new fleet and renewed his former enterprizes by cutting off such  corn and provisions as were consigned to Italy Thus the grievances of the poor were again renewed and the people began to complains that instead of three tyrants they were now oppressed by four  In this exigence Augustus who had long meditated the best means of diminishing the number re  ived to begin by getting rid of Pompey who kept  e state in continual alarms He was master of two fleets one which he had caused to be built at Ravenna and another which Menodorus who revolted from Pompey brought to his aid His first attempt was to invade Sicily but being overpowered in his passage by Pompey and afterwards shattered in a storm he was obliged to defer his designs to the ensuing year During this interval he was reinforced by a noble fleet of one hundred and twenty ships given him by Antony with which he resolved once more to invade Sicily on three several quarters But fortune seemed still determined to oppose him He was a second time disabled and shattered by a storm which so raised the vanity of Pompey that he began to style himself the son of Neptune However Augustus was not to be intimidated by any disgraces for having shortly resitted his navy and recruited his forces he gave the command of both to Agrippa his faithful friend and associate in war Agrippa proved himself worthy of the trust reposed in him he began his operations by a victory over Pompey and though he was shortly after worsted himself he soon after gave his adversary a complete and final overthrow Thus undone Pompey resolved to fly to Antony from whom he expected refuge as he had formerly obliged that triumvir  by giving protection to his mother However a gleam of hope offering he tried once more at the head of a small body of men to make himself independent and even surprised Anthony's lieutenants  who had been sent to accept of his submissions Nevertheless he was at last abandoned by his soldiers and delivered up to Titus Antony's lieutenant who shortly after caused him to be slain  The death of this general removed one very powerful obstacle to the ambition of Augustus and he resolved to take the easiest opportunity to get rid of the  of his associates  All  an  ther this was furnished by Lepidus that served as a sufficient pretext to Augustus for depriving him of his share in the triumvirate Being at the head of twentytwo legions with a strong body of cavalry he idly supposed that his present power was more than an equivalent to the popularity of Augustus He therefore resolved upon adding Sicily where he then was to his province pretending a right as having first invaded it Augustus sent to expostulate upon these proceedings But Lepidus fiercely re  lied  That he was determined to have his share in the administration and would no longer submit to let one alone possess all the authority  Augustus was previously informed of the disposition of Lepidus's soldiers for he had by his secret intrigues and largesses entirely attached them to himself Wherefore without further de  ay he with great boldness went alone to the camp of Lepidus and with no other assistance than his private bounties and the authority he had guined by his former victories he deposed his rival Lepidus was deprived of all his former authority and banished to Circa  um where he continued the rest of his life despised by his friends and to all a melancholy object or blasted ambition  Th  e remained now but one obstacle to his ambition which was Antony whom he resolved to rem  and for that purpose began to render his character as contemptible as he possibly could at Rome In fact Anthony's conduct did not a little contribute  to promote the endeavours of his ambitious partner He had marched against the Parthians with a prodigious army but was forced to return with the  the fourth part of his forces and all his bag  However Antony seemed quite regardless  tempt alive only to pleasure and totally dis  the business of the state he spent whole  nights in the company of Cleopatra who  every art to encrease his passion and vary  n  ertainments Few women have been so much  for the art of giving novelty to pleasure  ing trifles important still ingenious in fil    up the languid pauses of sensual delight with  new stroke of refinement she was at one time a  then a Bacchanal and sometimes an hunte  s She invented a society called The Inimitable  of the court who made the most sumptuous on  inments carried away the prize Not contented with sharing in her company all the delights which Egypt could afford Antony was resolved to enlarge his sphere of luxury by granting her many  kingdoms which belonged to the Roman e  pl  e He gave her all Phaenicia CeloSyria and Cyprus with a great part of Cilicia Arabia and judea aifts which he had no right to bestow but  ich he pretended to grant in imitation of Her  s This complication of vice and folly at last totally exasperated the Romans and Augustus willing to take the advantage of their resentment took  exaggerate all his defects At length when he found the people sufficiently irritated against him he resolved to send Octavia who was then at Rome  Antony as if with a view of reclaiming her husband but in fact to furnish a sufficient pretext of ca  ing war against him as he knew she would be di  mis  ed with contempt  Antony was now at the city of Leucoplis revelling with his insiduous paramour when he heard  that Octavia was at Athens upon her journey to visit him This was very unwelcome news as well to him as to Cleopatra who scaring the charms of her rival endeavoured to convince Antony of the strength of her passion by her s  ghs languishing looks and wellfeigned melancholy He frequently caught her in tears which she seemed as if willing to hide and often entreated her to tell him the cause which she seemed willing to suppress These artifices together with the ceaseless flattery and importunity of her creatures prevailed so much upon Antony's weakness that he commanded Octavia to return home without seeing her and still more to exasperate the people of Rome he resolved to repudiate her and take Cleopatra as his wife He accordingly assembled the people of Alexandria in the public theatre where was raised an alcove of silver under which were placed two thrones of gold one for himself and the other for Cleopatra There he seated himself drest like Bacchus while Cleopatra sat beside him cloathed in the ornaments and attributes of Isis the principal deity of the Egyptians On that occasion he declared her queen of all the countries which he had already bestowed upon her while he associated Caesario her son by Caesar as her partner in the government To the two children which he had by her himself he gave the title of king of kings with very extensive domanions and to crown his absurdities he next sent a minute account of his proceedings to the two consuls at Rome  In the mean time Augustus had now a sufficient pretext for declaring war and informed the senate of his intentions However he deferred the execution of his design for a while being then employed in quelling an insurrection of the Illyrians The following year was chiefly taken up in preparations against Antony who perceiving his design remonstrated to the senate that he had many causes of  complaint against his colleague who had seized upon Sicily without affording him a share alledging that he had also dispossest Lepidus and kept to himself the province he had commanded and that  and divided all Italy among his own soldiers leaving nothing to recompence those in Asia To this complaint Augustus was contented to make a sarcastic answer implying that it was absurd to complain of his distribution of a few tristing districts in Italy when Antony having conquered Parthia he might now reward his soldiers with cities and provinces This sarcasm provoked him to send his army without intermission into Europe to meet Augustus while he and Cleopatra followed to Samos in order to prepare for carrying on the war with vigour When arrived there it was ridiculous enough to behold the odd mixture of preparations for pleasure and for war On one side all the kings and princes from Egyp to the Euxine sea had orders to send him supplies both of men provisions and arms on the other side all the comedians dancers buffoons and musicians ot Greece were ordered to attend him  This delay at Samos and afterwards at Athens where he carried Cleopatra to receive new honours was extremely favourable to the arms of Augustus who was at first scarcely in a dispo  ition to oppose him had he gone into Italy but he soon found  to put himself in a condition for  rying on the  and shortly after declared it against him in  At length both sides found themselves in re  iness to begin the war and their armies were answerable to the empire they contended for The on  was followed by all the forces of the East the other drew a  l the strength of the West to support his pretensions Antony's force composed a body of an hundred thousand foot and twelve thousand horse while his fleet amounted to five hundred  ships of war The army of Augustus mustered but eighty thousand foot but equalled his adversary's in the number of cavalry his fleet was but half as numerous as Antony's however his ships were better built and manned with better soldiers  The great decisive engagement which was a naval one was fought near Actium a city of Epirus at the entrance of the gulph of Ambracia Antony ranged his ships before the mouth of the gulph and Augustus drew up his fleet in opposition Neither general assumed any sixt station to command in but went about from ship to ship wherever his presence was necessary In the mean time the two land armies on opposite sides of the gulph were drawn up only as spectators of the engagement and encouraged the fleets by their shouts to engage The battle began on both sides with great ardour and after a manner not practised upon former occasions The prows of their vessels were armed with brazen points and with these they drove furiously against each other They fought for some time with great fury nor was there any advantage on either side except a small appearance of disorder in the centre of Antony's fleet But all of a sudden Cleopatra determined the fortune of the day She was seen s  ying from the engagement attended by sixty sail struck perhaps with the terrors natural to her sex but what encreased the general amazement was to behold Antony himself following soon after leaving his fleet at the mercy of the conquerors and the army at land soon after followed their example  When Cleopatra fled Antony pursued her in a fiveoared galley and coming along side of her ship entered it without seeing or being seen by her She was in the stern and he went to the prow where he remained for some time silent holding his head between his hands In this manner he continued three whole days during which either  through indignation or shame he neither saw nor spoke to Cleopatra At last when they were arrived at the promontory of Tenarus the queen's female attendants reconciled them and every thing went on as before Still however he had the consolation to suppose his army continued faithful to him and accordingly dispatched orders to his lieutenant Canidius to conduct it into Asia However he was soon undeceived when he arrived in Africa where he was informed of their submission to his rival This account so transported him with rage that he was hardly prevented from killing himself but at length at the entreaty of his friends he returned to Alexandria Cleopatra however seemed to retain that fortitude in her misfortunes which had utterly abandoned her admirer Having amassed considerable riches by means of confiscations and other acts of violence she formed a very singular and unheard of project this was to convey her whole fleet over the isthmus of Suez into the Red Sea and thereby save herself in another region beyond the reach of Rome with all her treasures Some of  r vessels were actually transported thither pursuant to her orders but the Arabians having burnt them and Antony dissuading her from the design she  it for the more improbable scheme of defending Egypt against the conqueror She omitted nothing in her power to put this advice in practice and made all kinds of preparations for war at least  thereby to obtain better terms from Augustus In fact she had always loved Antony's fortunes rather than his person and if she could have fallen  any method of saving herself though even at its expence there is no doubt but she would have embraced it with gladness She even still had some  pes from the power of her charms though she was arrived almost at the age of forty and was desirous of trying upon Augustus those arts which had  been so successful with the greatest men of Rome▪ Thus in three embassies which were sent one after another from Antony to Augustus in Asia the queen had always her secret agents charged with particular proposals in her name Antony desired no more than that his life might be spared and to have the liberty of passing the remainder of his days in obscurity To those proposals Augustus made no reply Cleopatra sent him also public proposals in favour of her children but at the same time privately resigned him her crown with all the ensigns of royalty To the queen's public proposal no answer was given to her private offer he replied by giving her assurances of his favour in case she sent away Antony or put him to death These negociations were not so private but they came to the knowledge of Antony whose jealousy and rage every occurrence now contributed to heighten He built a small solitary house upon a mole in the sea and there shut himself up a prey to all those passions that are the tormentors of unsuccessful tyranny There he past his time shunning all commerce with mankind and professing to imitate Timon the manhater However his furious jealousy drove him even from this retreat into society for hearing that Cleopatra had many sec  conferences with one Thyrsus an emissary from Augustus he seized upon him and having ordered him to be cruelly scourged he sent him back to his patron At the same time he sent letters by him importing that he had chastized Thyrsus for insulting a man in misfortunes but withal he gave Augustus permission to avenge himself by scourging Hiparchus Antony's freedman in the same manner The revenge in this case would have been highly pleasing to Antony as Hiparchus h  left him to join the fortunes of his more successful rival  Meanwhile the operations of the war were carried vigorously forward and Egypt soon after became again the theatre of the contending armies of Rome Gallus the lieutenant of Augustus took Paretonium which opened the whole country to his incursions On the other side Antony who had still considerable forces by sea and land wanted to take that important place from the enemy He therefore marched towards it flattering himself that as soon as he should shew himself to the legions which he had once commanded the affection for their ancient general would revive  ed therefore and exhorted them to rem  former vows of fidelity Gallus how  dered all the trumpets to sound in order t  Antony from being heard so that he was ob  o retire  Augustus himself was in the mean time ad  ing with another army before Pelusium which  its strong situation might have retarded his progre  for some time But the governor of the city either wanting courage to defend it or previously instructed by Cleopatra to give it up permitted him to take possession of the place so that Augustus had now no obstacle in his way to Alexandria whither  e  a  ched with all expedition Antony upon his  ival s  llied out to oppose him fighting with great desperation and putting the enemy's cavalry to  ight This slight advantage once more revived his declining hopes and being naturally vain he reentered Alexandria in triumph Then going all armed as he was to the palace he embraced Cleopatra and presented her a soldier who had distinguished himself in the late engagement The queen rewarded him very magnificently presenting him with an head piece and breastplate of gold With these however the soldier went off the next night to the other army prudently resolving to secure his  riches by keeping on the strongest side Antony could not bear this defection without fresh indignation he resolved therefore to make a bold expiring effort by sea and land but previously offered to fight his adversary in single combat Augustus too well knew the inequality of their situations to comply with this forlorn offer he only therefore coolly replied that Antony had ways enough to die besides single combat  The day after he posted the few troops he had remaining upon a rising ground near the city from whence he sent order  to his gallies to engage the enemy There he waited to be a spectator of the combat and at first he had the stisfaction to see them advance in good order but his approbation was soon turned into rage when he saw his ships only saluting those of Augustus and both fleets uniting together and failing back into the harbour At the very same time his cavalry deserted him He tired however to lead on his infantry which were easily vanquished and he himself compelled to return into the town His anger was now ungovernable he could not help crying out aloud as he past that he was betrayed  y Cleopatra and delivered by her to those who for her sake alone were his enemies In these suspicions he was not deceived for it was by secret orders from the queen that the sleet had past over to the enemy  Cleopatra had for a long while dreaded the effects of Antony's jealousy and had some time befo  e prepared a method of obviating any sudden sallies it might produce Near the temple of Isis she had erected a building which was seemingly designed for a sepulchre Hither she removed all her treasure and most valuable effects covering them over with torches saggots and other combustible matter This sepulchre she designed to answer a double purpose as well to screen her from the sudden  resentments of Antony as to make Augustus believe that she would burn all her treasures in case he refused her proper terms of capitulation Here therefore she retired from Antony's present fury matting the gates which were fortified with bolts and bars of iron but in the mean time gave orders that a report should be spread of her death which news soon reached Antony and recalled all his former love and tenderness This poor wretch was now a being subject to the gust of every passion and e  ch of them in extreme He now lamented her death with the same violence he had but a few mi  t  before seemed to desire it "Wretched man"  he to himself  what is there now worth living for since all that could sooth or soften my  is departed O Cleopatra  continued he  got to his chamber  our separation does not  much afflict me as the disgrace I suffer in  ring a woman to instruct me in the ways of dying  He called one of his freedmen named  whom he had engaged by oath to kill him whenever fortune should drive him to this last res  ce Ero  being commanded to perform his pro  this faithful follower drew the sword as it go  ng to execute his orders but turning his face  ged it into his own bosom and died at his mas  Antony for a whi  e hung over his faith  servant and commending his fidelity took up  e sword with which stabbing himself in the belly  backward upon a little couch Though the war▪ was mortal yet the blood stopping he recove  d  spirits and earnestly conjured those who  me into the room to put an end to his life  led being seized with f  ight and h  r  He  herefore continued in this manner for  me time still crying out and writhing with p  in  informed by one of the queen's secretaries  mistress was still alive He then earnestly  desired to be carried to the place where she was They accordingly brought him to the gate of the sepulchre but Cleopatra who would not permit it to be opened appeared at the window and threw down cords with which with some difficulty they pulled him up They gently laid him on a couch▪ where she gave way to her sorrow tearing her cloaths beating her breast and kissing the wound of which he was dying Antony entreated her to moderate the transports of her grief asked for wine and exhorting her not to lament for his misfortunes but to congratulate him upon his former felicity to consider him as one who had lived the most powerful of men and at last died by the hand of a Roman Just as he had done speaking he expired and Proculus made his appearance by command of Augustus who had been informed of Antony's desperate conduct He was sent to try all means of getting Cleopatra into his power Augustus having a double motive for his solicitude on this occasion one to prevent her destroying the treasures she had taken with her into the tomb the other to preserve her person as an ornament to grace his triumph Cleopatra however was upon her guard and would not confer with Proculus except through the gate which was very well secured In the mean time Gallus one of Augustus's soldiers entered wi  h two more by the window at which Antony had been drawn up upon which Cleopatra perceiving what happened drew a poniard and attempted to stab herself but was prevented  Augustus was extremely pleased at finding her in his power he sent Epaphroditus to bring her to his palace and to watch her with the utmost circumspection He was likewise ordered to use her in every respect with that deference and submission which were due to her rank and to do every thing in his power to render her captivity agreeable She was  permitted to have the honour of granting Antony the  s of burial and furnished with every thing she desired that was becoming his dignity to receive or her love to offer Yet still she languished under her new confinement her excessive sorrow her many losses and the blows she had given her bosom produced a sever which she seemed willing to en  e  se She resolved to abstain from taking any  hment under the pretence of a regimen nece  sary for her disorder but Augustus being made appointed with the real motive by her physician  to threaten her with regard to her children in  she persisted  In the mean time Augustus made his entry into Alexandria taking care to mitigate the fears of the  by conversing fami  iarly as he went so  g with Areus a philosopher and a native of the place The citizens however trembled at his approach and when he placed himself upon the tribunal they prostrated themselves with their faces to the ground before him like criminals who waited the sentence of their execution Augustus presently ordered them to rise telling them that three mot  s induced him to pardon them His respect for Alexander who was the founder of their city his admiration of its beauty and his friendship for Arcus their fellowcitizen Two only of particular note were put to death upon this occasion Antony's elde  t son Antyllus and Caesario the son of Julius Caesar both betrayed into his hands by their respective tutors who themselves suffered for their p  i  y shortly after As for the rest of Cleopatra's children he treated them with great gentleness leaving them to the care of those who were intrusted with their education who had orders to provide them with every thing suitable to their birth As for h  when she was  ecovered from her late indi  position he came to visit her in person she received  him b  ing on a couch in a careless manner  and upon th  entering the apartment rose up to prostrate her  lf before him She was drest in nothing but a long robe Her misfortunes had given an air of severity to her features her hair was dishev  lled her voice trembling her complexion pale and her eyes red with w  ping Yet still her natural b  ty secured to  through the distresses th  t surrounded her and the graces of her motion and the alluring s  t  es  of her looks still bore ter    ny to the  or power of her charms Augustus raise  her with his usu  l complaisance and desiri  g her to it placed himself beside her Cleopatra had be  n prep  e  for this interview and made use of every method she coould think of to propitiate the conqueror She tried apologies entreaties and allurements to obtain his favour and soften his resentment She began by attempting to justify her conduct but when her art and skill failed against manifest proofs she turned her defence into supplications She talked of Caesar's humanity to those in distress she read some of his letters to her full of tenderness and enlarged upon the long intimacy that had past between them "But of what service" cried she  are now all his benefits to me Why could I not die with him Yet he still lives methinks I see him still before me he revives in you  Augustus was no stranger to this method of address but he remained firm against all attacks answering always with a cold indifference which obliged her to give her attempts a different turn▪ She now addrest his avarice presenting him with a  inv  ntory of her treasure and jewels This gave occasion to a very singular scene which shews that the little dec  rums of breeding were then by no means so carefully attended to as at present One of he  stewards having alledged that the inventory was de+fective and that she had secreted a part of her effects  she fell into a violent passion started from her couch and catching him by the hair gave him several blows on the face Augustus smiled at her indignation and lead  ng her to the couch desired her to be pacified To this she replied that she could not bear being insulted in the presence of one whom she so highly esteemed "And supposing" cried she  that I have secreted a few trifles am I to blame when they are reserved not for myself but for Livia and Octavia whom I hope to make my intercessors with you  This excuse which intimated a desire of living was not disagreeable to Augustus who politely assured her that she was at liberty to keep whatever she had reserved and that in every thing she should be indulged to the height of her expectations He then took leave and departed imagining he had reconciled her to life and to the indignity of being shewn in the intended triumph which he was preparing for his return to Rome but in this he was deceived Cleopatra all this time had kept a correspondence with Dolabella a young Roman of high birth in the camp of Augustus who perhaps from compassion or stronger motives was interested in her misfortunes by him she was secretly informed that Augustus determined to send her off in three days together with her children to Rome to grace his triumphant entry She now therefore determined upon dying she now threw herself upon Antony's coffin bewailed her captivity and renewed her protestations not to survive him Having bathed and ordered a sumptuous banquet  e  tti  ed herself in the most splendid manner She then feasted as usual and soon after ordered all but  er two at endants Charmion and Iras to leave the  oom Then having previously ordered an asp to  e secretly conveyed to her in a basket of fruit she  ent a letter to Augustus informing him of her fatal purpose and desiring to be buried in the same tomb  with Antony Augustus upon receiving the letter instantly dispatched messengers to stop her intentions but they arrived too late Upon entering the chamber they beheld Cleopatra lying dead upon a gilded couch arrayed in her royal robes Near her Iras one of her faithful attendants was stretched lifeless at the feet of her mistress and Charmion herself almost expiring was settling the diadem upon Cleopatra's head "Alas" cried one of the messengers "was this well done Charmion" "Yes" replied she  it is well done such a death becomes a glorious queen descended from a race of noble ancestors  On pronouncing these words she fell down and died with her much loved mistress  CHAP XXII From the beginning of the reign of Augustus to the death of Domitian the last of the twelve Caesars  BY the death of Antony Augustus was now be+come master of the Roman Empire He soon afte  returned to Rome in triumph where by sumptu+ous feasts and magnificent shows he began to ob  i+terate the impressions of his former cruelty and from thence forward resolved to secure by his cle+mency a throne the foundations of which were laid in blood He was now at the head of the most extensive empire that mankind had ever concurred i  obeying The former spirit of the Romans and those characteristic marks that distinguished them from others were totally lost The city was now inhabited by a concourse from all the countries o  the world and being consequently divested of a  +just patriotic principles perhaps a monarchy was th  best form of government that could be found to unite  its members However it is very remarkable that during these long contentions among themselves and these horrid devastations by civil war the state was daily growing more formidable and powerful and completed the destruction of all the kings who presumed to oppose it  His first care was to assure himself of the friends of Antony to which end he publicly reported that he had burnt all Antony's letters and papers without  ing convinced that while any thought themselves suspected they would be fearful of even offering him their friendship  As he had gained the kingdom by his army so  he resolved to govern it by the senate This  though greatly fallen from their ancient splen  ▪ he knew to be the best ordered and most capable  wisdom and justice To these therefore he  the chief power in the administration of his go  ment while he still kept the people and the army  to him by donatives and acts of favour By these means all the odium of justice fell upon the senate and all the popularity of pardon was solely his own Th  s restoring to the senate their ancient splendor and discountenancing all corruption he pretended to reserve to himself a very moderate share of authority which none could refuse him namely an a  o  ute power to compel all ranks of the state to do their duty This in fact was reserving absolute dom  nion in his own hands but the misguided p  ple began to look upon his moderation with astonishment they considered themselves as restored to their former freedom except in the capacity of promo  ing sedition and the senate supposed their power reestablished in all things but their tendency to injustice It was even said that the Romans by such a government lost nothing of the happiness that liberty could produce and were exempt from all the misfortunes it could occasion This observation  might have some truth under such a monarch as Augustus now appeared to be but they were taught to change their sentiments under his successors when they found themselves afflicted with all the punishments that tyranny could inflict or sedition make necessary  After having established this admirable order Augustus found himself agitated by different inclinations and considered a long time whether he should keep the empire or restore the people to their ancient liberty But he adopted the advice of Maecenas who desired him to continue in power and was afterwards swayed by him not only in this instance but on every other occasion By the instructions of that minister he became gentle affable and humane▪ By his advice it was that he encouraged men of learning and gave them much of his time and his friendship They in their turn relieved his most anxious hours and circulated his praise through the empire  Thus having given peace and happiness to the empire and being convinced of the attachment of all the orders of the state to his person he resolved upon impressing the people with an idea of his magnanimity also This was nothing less than making a s  w of resigning his authority wherefore having previ  usly instracted his creatures it the senate how to act he addressed them in a studied speech importing the difficulty of governing so extensive an empi  e a task which he said none but the immo  tal  were equal to He modestly urged his own inability though impellled by every motive to undertake it and then wi  h a degree of seeming generosity f  eely gave up all that power which as he observed his arms had gained and the senate had c  firmed This power he repeatedly offered to restore giving them to understand that the true spirit of the Romans was not lost in him This  speech operated upon the senate variously as they were more or less in the secret many believed the sincerity of his professions and therefore regarded his conduct as an act of unequalled heroism by any thing that had hitherto appeared in Rome others equal  y ignorant of his motives distrusted his designs Some there were who having greatly suffered during the late popular commotions were fearful of having them renewed but the majority who were entirely devoted to his interests and instructed by his ministers frequently attempted to interrupt him while speaking and received his proposal with pretended indignation These unanimously besought him not to resign the administration but upon his continuing to decline their request they in a manner compelled him to comply However that his person might be in greater security they immediately decreed the pay of his guard to be doubled On the other hand that he might seem to make some concessions on his side he permitted the senate to govern the weak internal provinces of the empire while the most powerful provinces and those that required the greatest armies for their defence were taken entirely under his own command Over these he assumed the government but for ten years leaving the people still in hopes of regaining their antient freedom but at the same time laying his measures so well that his government was renewed every ten years to his death  This shew of a resignation only served to confirm him in the empire and the hearts of the people New honours were heaped upon him He was then first called Augustus a name I have hitherto used as t  at by which he is best known in history A laurel was ordered to be planted at his gates His house was called the palace to distinguish it from that of ordinary citizens He was confirmed in the title of father of his country and his person declared sacred  and inviolable In short flattery seemed on the rack to find out new modes of pleasing him but though he despised the arts of the senate he permitted their homage well knowing that among mankind titles produce a respect which enforces authority  Upon entering into his tenth consulship the senate by oath approved of all his acts and set him wholly above the power of the laws They some time after offered to swear to not only all the laws he had made but such as he should make for the future It was then customary with fathers upon their deathbeds to command their children to carry oblations to the Capitol with this inscription that at the day of their deaths they left Augustus in health It was determined that no man should be put to death on such days as the emperor entered the city Upon a dearth of provisions the people in a body entreated him to accept of the dictatorship but though he undertook to be procurator of the provisions he would by no means accept of the title of dictator which had been abolished by a law made when Antony was consul  This accumulation of titles and employments did not in the least diminish his assiduity in filling the duties of each Several very wholesome edicts were passed by his command tending to suppress corruption in the senate and licentiousness in the people He ordained that none should exhibit a show of gladiators without orders from the senate and then no oftener than twice a year nor with more than a hundred and twenty at a time This law was extremely necessary at so corrupt a period of the empire when whole armies of these unfortunate men were brought at once upon the stage and compelled to fight often till half of them were slain It had been usual a  so with the knights and some women of the first distinction to exhibit themselves as dancers  upon the theatre he ordered that not only they but their children and grandchildren should be restrained from such exercises for the future He fined many that had refused to marry at a certain age and rewarded such as had many children He ordered that virgins should not be married till twelve years of age and permitted any person to kill an adulterer taken in the fact▪ He enacted that the senators should be always held in great reverence adding to their authority what he had taken from their power He made a law that no man should have the fre  m of the city without a previous examination  to his merit and character He appointed new  and limits to the manumission of slaves and  s himself very strict in the observance of them Wi  reg  rd to players of whom he was very fond  examined their  not allowing the  in their lives nor indecency in  actions Though he encouraged the athletic  yet he would not permit w  men to be present  t them holding it unb  ming the modesty of  to be spectators of these sports which were p  med by naked men In order to prevent brib  ry in suing for offices he took considerable sums of  from the candidates by way of pledge and if any indirect practices were proved against them they were obliged to forfeit  ll Slaves had been  dissallowed to conf  s  any thing against their own masters but he abolished the practice and first  the slave to another which altering the prop  y his examination became  These and many other laws al  tending to reform vice or  crimes gave the manners of the people an  her complexion so that the rough character of the Roman was now softened into that of the refined ci  n  his own example a good deal tended to humanize his fellow citizens for being placed above all  equality he had nothing to fear from condescensions wherefore he was familiar with all and suffered himself to be reprimanded with the most patient humility Though he was by the single authority of his station capable of condemning or acquitting whomsoever he thought proper yet he gave the laws their proper course and even sometimes pleaded for those he desired to protect Thus Primus the governe  of Macedonia having a day assigned him for having made war upon the O  isii a neighbouring state as he said by the command of Augustus the latter denied the charge Upon which the advocate for Primus desired to know with an insolent air what brought Augustus into court or who had sent for him To this the emperor submissively replied "the common health" an answer which greatly pleased the people Upon another occasion one of his veteran soldiers entreated his protection in a certain cause but Augustus taking little notice of his request desired him to apply to an advocate "Ah" replied the soldier  it was not by proxy that I served you at the battle of Actium  This reply pleased Augustus so much that he pleaded his cause in person and gained it for him He was extremely affable and returned the salutations of the meanest persons One day a person presented him a petition but with so much awe that Augustus was displeased with his meanness "What friend" cried he  you seem as if you were offering something to an elephane and not to a man be bolder  One day as he was sitting on the tribunal in judgment Maecenas perceiving by his temper that he was inclined to be severe attempted to speak to him but not being able to get up to the tribunal for the crowd he threw a paper into his lap on which was written "arise executioner" Augustus read it without any displeasure and immediately rising pardoned those whom he was disposed to condemn  But what most of all shewed a total alteration in his disposition was his treatment of Cornelius Cinna Pompey's grandson This nobleman had entered into a very dangerous conspiracy against him but the plot was discovered before it was ripe for execution Augustus for some time debated with himself how to act but at last his clemency prevailed▪ he therefore sent for those who were guilty and after reprimanding them dismissed them all But he was resolved to mortify Cinna by the greatness of  generosity for addressing him in particular  I have twice  says he  given you your life fi  st▪ as an enemy now as a conspirator I now give you the consulship let us therefore be friends for the future and let us only contend in  ewing whether my confidence or your fideli  y shall be victorious  This generosity which  emperor very happily timed had so good an eff  t▪ that from that instant all conspiracies ceased against him  In the practice of such virtues as these he passed  reign of above forty years in which the hap  nes  of the people seemed to conspire with his own  but that there were wars in the distant provinces  the empire during almost the whole reign but  we  e rather the quelling of insurrections than  of dominions for he had made it a  to carry on no operations in which ambition  not the safety of the state was concerned In  he seemed the first Roman who aimed at gain  g a character by the arts of peace alone and who  the affections of the soldiers without any  talents of his own Nevertheless the Rom  under his lieutenants were crowned  The Cantabrians in Spain who had  were more than once quelled by Tiberius  Agrippa his soninlaw and Aelius  Lama who followed them to their inaccessible mountains there blocked them up and compelled them by famine to surrender discretion The Germans also gave some uneasiness by their repeated incursions into the territories of Gaul but were repressed by Lollius The Rhetians were conquered by Drusus the brother of Tiberius The Bessi and Si  la  e barbarous nations▪ making an irruption into Thrace were overthrown by  governor of Pamph  li  who gained triumphal  onours The Dacians were r  pressed with m  e t  one des  t  the Armenians also were brought into  subjection by Caius his grandson The Getull  in Af  i  to  k up arms but were subdued  e could Cai  Cossus who thence received th  name of Getulious A dangerous war a  so  c  sed a against the Dalmatian and Par  w  o  ing acquired great strength by  e  ntin  nce of a long peace gathered an army  tw  hundred thousand foot and nine thousan  horse threatening Rome itself with destruction  L  vies were therefore made in Italy with th  most expedition  the veteran troops were recalle  m all parts and Augustus went to Arminiu  or the greater convenience of giving his dire  ons And indeed though personal valour was  no means his most shining ornament yet no man could give wiser orders upon every emergency or go with greater dispatch into all parts of his dominions than he This war continued near three years being principally managed by Tiberius and Germanicus the latter of whom gained great reputation against these fierce and barbarous multitudes Upon their reduction Bato their leader being summoned before the tribunal of Tiberius and being demanded how he could offer to revolt against the power of Rome the bold  arbarian replied  That the Romans and not he were  the aggressors since they had sent instead of dogs and shepherds to secure their flocks only wolves and bears to devour them  But the war which was most fatal to the Roman interests  U C  during this reign was that which was managed by Quintillius Varus This general invading the territories of the Germans was induced to follow the enemy among their forests and marshes with his army in separate bodies there he was attacked by night and entirely cut off with his whole  my These were the best and choicest legions of the whole empire either for valour discipline or experience The affliction from this defeat seemed to sink very deep upon the mind of Augustus He was often heard to cry out in a tone of anguish "Quintillius Varus restore me my legions" and some historians pretend to say that he never after recovered the former serenity of his temper  But he had some uneasinesses of a domestic nature in h  s own family that contributed to distress him  had married Livia the wife of Tiberius Nero by the consent of her husband at a time she was six m  nths gone with child This was an imperious  and conscious of being beloved she cont  d him ever after at her pleasure She had two sons by her former husband Tiberius the elder whom she greatly loved and Brutus who was be  n three months after she had been married to A  g  s and who was thought to be his own son The older  of these Tiberius whom he afterwards  pted and who succeeded him in the empire was  general but of a suspicious and o  te tem  r▪ s  that though he was serviceable to Augustus  reign wars yet he gave him but little quiet it  He was at la  t obliged to go into exile for  years to the island of I  l  des where he chief  spent his time in a retire  manner conversing w  th the Greeks and addicting himself to be nature  of which however he made afterwards but a bad use Drusus the other son of Livia died in his return from an expedition against the Germans leaving Augustus inconsolable for his loss But his greatest affliction was the conduct of his daughter Julia whom he had by Scri  onia his former wife This woman whom he married to his general Agrippa and after his death to Tiberius set no bounds to her lewdness Not contented with enjoying her pleasures she seemed also earnest in procuring the infamy of her prestitutions Augustus for a long time would not believe the accounts he daily heard of her conduct but at last could not help observing them He found she was arrived at that excess of wantonness and prodigality that she had her nocturnal appointments in the most public parts of the city the very court where her father presided not being exempt from her debaucheries He at first had thoughts of putting her to death but after some consideration he banished her to Pandataria forbidding her the use of wine and all such delicacies as could inflame her vicicus inclinations he ordered also that no persons should come near her without his own permission and sent her mother Scribonia with her to bear her company Afterwards whenever any attempted to intercede for Julia his answer was  that fire and water should sooner unite than he with her  When some persons one day were more than usually urgent with him in her favour he was driven to such an extremity of passion as to wish that they might have such a daughter However she had two sons by Agrippa named Caius and Lucius from w  om great expectations were formed but they died when scarcely arrived at man's estate Lucius about five years after his father at Marscilles and Caius two years after Augustus having now in a great measure survived all his cotemporaries at length in the seventyfourth  year of his age began to think of retiring from the  igues of state and in some measure of constitutin  Tiberius his soninlaw by Livia his succes  his usual employments He desired the se  to s  lute him no longer at the palace according  not to take it amiss if for the future he  converse with them as formerly  U C  that time Tiberius was joined in the  went of the provinces with him and  with almost the same authority However  gu  s could not entirely forsake the administra  of the state which habit had mixed with his  sections he still continued a watchful guardian at its interests and shewed himself to the last a  er of his people Finding it now therefore very inconvenient to come to the senate by reason of his age he desired to have twenty privycounsellors assigned him for a year and it was decreed that whatever measures were resolved upon by them together with the consuls they should have entirely the force of a law He seemed in some measure apprehensive of his approaching end for he made his will and delivered it to the vestal virgins He then solemnized the census or numbering the people whom he found to amount to four millions one hundred and thirtyseven thousand which shews Rome to be equal to four of the greatest cities of modern times While these ceremonies were per  ning by a mighty concourse of people in the Campus Martius it is said that an eagle slew round the emperor several times and directing its flight to  uring temple perched over the name of Agrippa which was by the augurs conceived to por  nd the death of the emperor Shortly after having accompanied Tiberius in his march into Illyria  Beneventum he was there taken ill of a  Returning therefore from thence he  to Nola near Capua and there finding himself  dangerously ill he sent for Tiberius with the rest of his most intimate friends and acquaintance A few hours before his death he ordered a lookingglass to be brought and his hair to be adjusted with more than usual care He then addressed his friends whom he beheld surrounding his bed and desired to know whether he had properly played his part in life▪ to which being answered in the affirmative he cried out with his last breath  then give me your applause  and thus in the seventysixth year of his age after reigning forty one he expired in the arms of Livia bidding her remember their marriage and farewell  The death of the emperor when known caused inexpressible grief throughout the whole Roman empire it was even supposed that his wife Livia had some hand in hastening it willing to procure the succession more speedily for her son However this be she took care for some time to keep it concealed having guarded all the passages to the palace sometimes giving out that he was recovered and pretending a relapse At length having settled the succession to her mind she published the empero  's death and at the same time the ado  tion of Tiberius to the empire The emperor's funeral was performed with great magnificence The senators being in their places Tiberius on whom the care was devolved began a consolatory oration to them but suddenly s  e  ped in the beginning of his speech as unable to restrain the violence of his sorrow and instead of continuing gave his notes to Drusus his son who read them to the senate After this one of t  ed to emperor's freedmen publicly read his will in the senate house wherein he made Tiberius and  is b  s and by that Livia was likewise  dopted into the Julian family and honoured with  e n  e of Augusta Besides his will▪ four other  iting of his were produced One in which he  had left instructions concerning his funeral another containing an enumeration of his several exploits a third comprising an account of the provinces forces and even  es of the empire and the fourth a sche  le of directions to Tiberius for governing the empire Among these it was found to be his opinion  t no man how great a favourite soever he might be should be entrusted with too much authority lest it should induce him to turn tyrant Another maxim w  that n  e should desire to enlarge the empire which was already preserved with difficulty Thus be  med studious of serving his country to the very l  st and the sorrow of the people seemed equal to his  siduity It was decreed that all the women should mourn for him a whole year Temples were  ted to him divine honours were allowed him and the Numerius Atticus a senator willing to convert the adulation of the times to his own benefit recei  d a large sum of money for swearing that he saw him ascending into heaven so that no doubt re  d among the people concerning his divinity  Such were the honours paid to Augustus whose power began in the slaughter and terminated in the happiness of his subjects so that it was said of him  that it had been good for mankind if he had never seen born or if he never had died  It is very probable that the cruelties exercised in his triumvir  te were suggested by his colleagues or perhaps he thought in the case of Caesar's death that revenge was virtue Certain it is that these severities were in some measure necessary to restore public tranquility for until the Roman spirit was entirely eradicated no monarchy could be secure He gave the government an air suited to the disposition of the times he indulged his subjects in the pride of seeing the appearance of a republic while he made them really happy in the effects of a most absolu  e monarchy  guided by the most consummate prudence In this last virtue he seems to have excelled most monarchs and indeed could we separate Octavius from Augustus he would be one of the most faultless princes in history  U C AD  Tiberius was fiftysix years old when he took upon him the government of the Roman empire He had long lived in a profound state of dissimulation under Augustus and was not yet hardy enough to shew himself in his real character In the beginning of his reign nothing appeared but prudence generosity and clemency But the successes of Germanicus his nephew over the Germans first brought his natural dispositions to light and discovered the malignity of his mind without disguise He soon therefore began to consult on the most specious means of humbling the popularity of Germanicus and removing this object of his suspicions For this purpose he dispatched Piso to Germanicus a person of a furious and headstrong temper and in every respect fit to execute those fatal purposes for which he was designed His instructions were to oppose Germanicus upon every occasion and to excite all the hatred against him which without suspicion he could and even to procure his death if an opportunity should offer This agent succeeded Germanicus died soon after and as it was universally believed by poison  Having now no object of jealousy to keep him in awe he began to pull off the mask entirely and appear more in his natural character than befo  e In the beginning of his cruelties he took into his confidence Sejanus a Roman knight who found out the method of gaining his confidence by the most refined degree of dissimulation being an overmatch for his master in his own arts It is not well known whether he was the adviser of all the cruelties that ensued  soon after but certain it is that from the beginning of his ministry Tiberius seemed to become more fatally suspicious  Sejanus began by using all his address to persuade Tiberius to retire to some agreeable retreat remote from Rome By this he expected many advantages since there could be no access to the emperor but by him The emperor either prevailed upon by his per  uasions or pursuing the natural turn of his tem  which led to indolence and debauchery in the twe  th year of his reign left Rome and went into C  p  ni  under pretence of dedicating temples to Jupiter and Augustus Still growing weary of places  mankind might follow him with their comp  nts and distresses he withdrew himself into that  delightful island of Caprea three miles from  continent and opposite Naples Buried in  he gave himself up to his abandon  quite regardless of the miseries of his    n fact it had been happy for mankind had he  up his suspicions when he declined the fat  g  s of reigning and resigned the will to do harm when he divested himself of the power of doing good Put from the time of his retreat he became  cruel and Sejanus always endeavoured to en  e his distrusts Secret spies and informers were  in all parts of the city who converted the most  rmless actions into subjects of offence  In c  nsequence of this Nero and Drusus the  Germanicus were declared enemies to  and afterwards starved to death in prison  Agrippina their mother was sent into banishment Sabinus Asinius Gallus and Syriacus were upon slight pretences condemned and execut  In this manner Sejanus proceeded removing  who stood between him and the empire and eve  encreasing in confidence with Tiberius and  power with the senate The number of his statue  exceeding even those of the emperor people swor  by his fortune in the same manner as they would have done had he been actually upon the throne and he was more dreaded than even the tyrant who actually enjoyed the empire But the rapidity of his rise seemed only preparatory to the greatness of his downfall All we know of his first disgrace with the emperor is that Satrius Secundus was the man who had the boldness to accuse him of treason and Antonia the mother of Germanicus seconded the accusation The senate who had long been jealous of his power and dreaded his cruelty immediately took this opportunity of going beyond the orders of Tiberius and instead of sentencing him to imprisonment they directed his execution As he was conducting to his fate the people loaded him with insult and execration He was pursued with sarcastic reproach  s his st  tues were instantly thrown down and he himself shortly after strangled by the executioner  His death only lighted up the emperor's rage for farther executions Plancina the wife of Piso Sextus  e  iu  Vescula  ius Atticus and Julius Marinus were executed by his command for being attached to Sejanus He began to grow weary of particular executions and gave orders that all the accused should be put to death together without farther examination The whole city was filled with slaughter and mourning When one Carnu  ius had killed himself to avoid the torture "Ah" cried Tiberius▪  h  w has that man been able to escape me  When a prisoner earnestly entreated that he would not deter his death "No" cried the tyrant  I am not sufficiently your friend to shorten your torments  In this manner he lived odious to all the world and troublesome to himself an enemy to the lives of  others and a tormentor of his own At length in the twentysecond year of his reign he began to feel the approaches of his dissolution and all his appetites totally to forsake him He now therefore found it was time to think of a successor and at length fixed upon Caligula willing perhaps by  enormity of Caligula's conduct with which he was well acquainted to cover the memory of his    Still however he seemed willing to avoid his  and strove by change of place to put off the inquietude of his own reflections He left his  vourite Island and went upon the continent and  last s  ed at the promontory of Misenum in a  use that formerly had belonged to Lucullus It  there that he fell into such faintings as all be  were fatal Caligula supposing him actually  caused himself to be acknowledged by the  soldiers and went forth from the empe  partment amidst the applauses of the multitude  all of a sudden he was informed that the em  wa

th  ugh a feigned solicitude for the fate of  Caligula seemed thunderstruck he pre  gloomy silence expecting nothing but  of the empire at which he had aspir  Ma  o however who was hardened in crime

 reign that Christ was crucified as if the universal depravity of mankind wanted no less a sacrifice than that of God himself to reclaim them Shortly after his death Pilate wrote to Tiberius an account of his passion resurrection and miracles upon which the emperor made a report of the whole to the senate desiring that Christ might be accounted God by the Romans But the senate being displeased that the proposal had not come first from themselves refused to allow of his apotheosis alledging an ancient law which gave them the superintendence in all matters of religion They even went so far as by an edict to command that all Christians should leave the city but Tiberius by another edict threatened death to all such as should accuse them by which means they continued unmolested during the rest of his reign  All the enormities of Caligula were concealed in the beginning of his reign But it had been happy for him and the empire had such a beginning been as stren  ously maintained In less than eight months all appe  r  nce of moderation and clemency vanished while  p  ssions unexampled avarice and capricious cruelty began to take their turn in his mi  Pride

might dispatch them at a blow  Such insupportable and capricious cruelties produced many secret conspiracies against him but these were for a while deferred upon account of his intended expedition against the Germans and Bri  s which he undertook in the third year of his  gn For this purpose  U C AD  he caused nu  s l  vies to be made in all parts of the empire and talked with so much resoluti  n that it was universally believed he  conquer all before him His march perfectly  edicated the inequality of his temper sometimes it was so rapid that the cohorts were obliged to leave  heir standards behind them at other times it was so  w that it more resembled a pompous procession than a military expedition In this disposition he would cause himself to be carried on eight men's  and ordered all the neighbouring cities  ve their streets well swept and watered to defend him from the dust However all these mighty p  e  ti  ns ended in nothing Instead of conquering britain he only gave refuge to one of its banishe  princes and this he described in his letter to the  as taking possession of the whole island In  of conquering Germany he only led his army  seash  re in Batavia There disposing his  and warlike machines with great solemnity  up his men in order o  battle he went  galley with which coasting alone he  his trumpets to sound and the signal to  as if for an engagement upon which his  having had previous orders immediately fell  to ga  hering the shells that lay upon the shore int  their holine  s terming them the spoils of the con+quered ocean worthy of

distributing money among them dismissed them with orders to be joyful and congratulated them upon their riches But that such exploits should not pass without a memorial he caused a lofty tower to be erected by the seaside and ordered the galleys in which he had put to sea to be conveyed to Rome in a great measure by land  Cassius Cherea tribune of the praetorian bands was the person who at last freed the world of this tyrant Besides the motives which he had in common with other men he had received repeated insults from Caligula who tock all occasions of turning him into ridicule and impeaching him of cowardice merely because he happened to have an effeminate voice Whenever Cherea came to demand the watchword from the emperor according to custom he always gave him either Venus Adonis or some such implying effeminacy and softness He therefore secretly imported his designs to several senators and knights whom he knew to have received personal injuries from Caligula among whom was Valerius Asiaticus whose wife the emperor had debauched Annius Vinicianus also was desirous of  g  ging in the first design that o  ere  Besides th  se were Cl  mens the pr  fect and Cal    ade

some baths not far distant from the  The last day of the games was more splendid tha  the rest and Caligula seemed more sprightly an  condescending than usual He took great amuse+ment in seeing the people scramble for the fruits an  other rarities thrown by his order among them▪ and seemed no way apprehensive of the plot formed for his destruction In the mean time the conspi+racy began to transpire and had he had any friends left it could not fail of being discovered A senator who was present asking one of his ac+quaintance if he had heard any thing new the othe  replying in the negative "then you must know" says he  that this day will be represented the death of a tyrant  The other immediately understood him but desired him to be more cautious how he divulged a secret of so much importance The conspirators waited a great part of the day with the most extreme anxiety and at one time Caligula seemed resolved to spend the whole day without any refreshment This unexpected delay entirely exasperated Chorea and had he not been restrained he would have gone and perpetrated his design in the midst of all the people Just at that instant while he was yet hesitating what he should do Asprenas one of the conspirators persuaded Caligula to go to the bath and take some slight refreshment in order to enjoy the rest of the entertainment with greater relish The emperor therefore rising up the conspirators used every precaution to keep off the throng and to surround him under pretence of greater assiduity And these upon his entering into a little vaulted gallery that led from the theatre to the bath resolved to dispatch him Cherea first struck him to the ground with his dagger crying out  Tyrant think upon this  Immediately after the other conspirators rushed in and while the emperor continued to resist crying out that he was not yet dead they dispatched him with thirty wounds  Such was the merited death of Caius Caligula in  he twenty ninth year of his age after a short reign of three years ten months and eight days It will be unnecessary to add any thing more to his character than what Seneca says of him namely that nature seemed to have brought him forth to shew what was possible to be produced from the greatest vice supported by the greatest authority  As soon as the death of Caligula was made public  U C AD  it produced the greatest conf  on in all parts of the city The conspirators who only aimed at destroying a  nt without attending to a successor had all c  ght safety by retiring to private places Some  happening to run about the palace discovered Claudius Caligula's uncle lurking in a secret  where he had hid himself through fear Of this personage who had hitherto been despised for his imbecility they resolved to make an emperor and accordingly carried him upon their shoulders to the  amp where they proclaimed him at a time he expected nothing but death and the senate confirmed their choice  Claudius was now fifty years old when he began to reign The complicated diseases of his infancy  in some measure affected all the faculties both  his body and mind He was continued in a state  pupilage much longer than was usual at that time  emed in every part of life incapable of con  ucting himself  I'le commencement of his reign as it was with  o  her bad emperors gave the most promi  ng  f an happy continuance He began by pass  act of oblivion for all former words and ac  ▪ and disannulled all the cruel edicts of Cali  He shewed himself more moderate than his  with regard to titles and honours He  all persons upon severe penalties to sacrifice  to him as they had done to Caligula He was a  +duous in hearing and examining complaints a  frequently administered justice in person temp  +ing by his mildness the severity of strict justice  To his solicitude for the internal advantages of t  state he added that of a watchful guardianship o  the provinces He restored Judea to Herod Agripp  which Caligula had taken from Herod Antipas  uncle the man who had put John the Baptist  death and who was banished by order of the prese  emperor Claudius also restored such princes their kingdoms as had been unjustly dispossess  by his predecessors but deprived the Lycia  and Rhodians of their liberty for having pr  +moted insurrections and crucified some citizens  Rome  He even undertook to gratify the people by foreig  conquest The Britons who had for near an hu  +dred years been left in sole possession of their ow  island began to seek the mediation of Rome to que  their intestine commotions The principal ma  who desired to subject his native country to the R  +man dominion was one Berious who by many a  +guments persuaded the emperor to make a desce  upon the island magnifying the advantages th  would attend the conquest of it In pursuance of h  advice therefore Plautius the praetor was ordere  to pass over into Gaul and make preparations fo  this great expedition At first indeed his soldie  seemed backward to embark declaring that the were unwilling to make war beyond the limits of th  world for so they judged Britain to be However they were at last persuaded to go and the Britons under the conduct of their king Cynobelinus wer  several times overthrown  AD  These successes soon after induced Clau+dius to go into Britain in person upo  pretence that the natives were still seditious and ha  not delivered up some Roman fugitives who had taken shelter among them However his expedition seemed rather calculated for shew than service the time he continued in Britain which was in all but sixteen days was more taken up in receiving homage than extending his conquests Great rejoicings were made upon his return to Rome the senate decreed him a splendid triumph triumphal arches were erected to his honour and annual games instituted to commemorate his victories In the mean time the war was vigorously prosecuted by Plautius and his lieutenant Vespasian who according to Suetonius fought thirty battles with the enemy and by that means reduced a part of the island into the form of a Roman province However this war broke out afresh under the government of Ostorius who succeeded Plautius  AD  The Brit  ne either despising him for want of experience or hoping to gain advantages over a person newly come to command rose up in arms and disclaimed the Roman power The Iceni the Cangi and the Brigantes made a powerful resistance though they were at length overcome but the Silures or inhabitants of South Wales under their king Carectacus were the most formidable opponents the Roman generals had ever yet encountered This brave barbarian not only made a gallant defence but often seemed to claim a doubtful victory He with great conduct removed the seat of war into the most inaccessible parts of the country and for nine years kept the Romans in continual alarm  This general however upon the approach of Os  ius finding himself obliged to come to a decisive engagement addressed his countrymen with calm re  ation telling them that this battle would either establish their liberty or confirm their servitude that they ought to remember the bravery of their ancestors by whose valour they were delivered  from taxes and tributes and that this was the time to shew themselves equal to their progenitors Nothing however that undisciplined valour could perform could avail against the conduct of the Roman legions After an obstinate fight the Britons were entirely routed the wife and daughter of Caractacus were taken prisoners and he himself seeking refuge from Curtismandua queen of the Brigantes was treacherously delivered up to the conquerors When he was brought to Rome nothing could exceed the curiosity of the people to behold a man who had for so many years braved the power of the empire On his part he testified no marks of base dejection but as he was led through the streets happening to observe the splendor of every object around him "Alas" cried he  how is it possible that people possessed of such magnificence at home could think of envying Caractacus an humble cottage in Britain  When he was brought before the emperor while the other captives sued for pity with the most abject lamentations Caractacus stood before the tribunal with an intrepid air and seemed rather w  lling to accept of pardon than meanly solicitous of suing for it "If" cried he towards the end of his speech  I had yielded immediately and without opposition neither my fortune would have been remarkable no your glory memorable you would have ceased to be victorious and I had been forgotten If now therefore you spare my life I shall continue a perpetual example of your clemency  Claudius had the generosity to pardon him and Ostorius was decreed a triumph which however he did not live to enjoy  Claudius gave in the beginning of his reign the highest hopes of an happy continuance but he soon began to lessen his care for the public and to commit to his favourites all the concerns of the empire This weak prince had from his infancy been in a state  of pupilage and now when called to govern he was unable to act but under the direction of others The chief of his instructors was his wife Messalin  whose name is almost become a common appellation for women of abandoned characters  By her was Claudius urged on to commit cruelties which he considered only as wholesome severities while her debaucheries became every day more notorious and her lewdness exceeded what had ever been seen in Rome Her crimes and enormities however being at length discovered she together with her paramour Caius Silius suffered that death they so justly deserved  Claudius took for his second wife Agrippina the daughter of his brother Germanicus a woman of a cruel and ambitious spirit whose whole aim being to procure the succession for Nero her son by a former marriage treated Claudius with such haughtiness that he was heard to declare when heated with wine that it was his fate to suffer the disorders of his wives and to be their executioner This expression sunk deep on her mind and engaged all her  cu  t  es to prevent the blow She therefore resolved not to defer a crime which she had meditated a long while before which was to poison him S  for some time however debated with herself in what manner she should administer the poison as she feared too strong a dose would discover her  or  and one too weak might fail of its effect At len  th she determined upon a poison of singular  to destroy his intellects and yet not suddenly to terminate his life As she had been long con  er  nt in this horrid practice she applied to a wom  n e  ded  ocusta notorious for assisting on such occ  sion  The poison was given the emperor among mashrooms a dish he was particularly fond of  ortly after having eaten he dropped down insen  but this caused no alarm as it was usual with  him to sit eating till he had  his faculties and was obliged to be  from the table However his co  tuti  eemed to overcome the effects of the  Agrippina resolved to make sure of his  therefore she directed a wretched physician who was her creature to  a

crucified with his head downwards which death he chose as being more dishonourable than that of his divine master  A conspiracy formed against Nero by Piso a man of great power and integrity which was prematurely discovered opened a new train of suspicions that destroyed many of the principal families in Rome The two most remarkable personages who fell on this occasion were Seneca the philosopher and Lucan the poet who was his nephew Nero either having real testimony against him or else hating him for his virtues sent a tribune to Seneca informing him that he was suspected as an accomplice The tribune found the philosopher at table with Paulina his wife and informing him of his business Seneca replied without any emotion that his welfare depended upon no man that he had never been accustomed to indulge the errors of the emperor and would not do it now When this answer was brought to Nero he demanded whether Seneca seemed afraid to die the tribune replying that he did not appear in the least terrified  Then go to him again  cried the emperor  and give him my orders to die  Accordingly he sent a centurion to Seneca signifying that it was the emperor's pleasure that he should die Seneca seemed no way discomposed and was not unminded of his constancy He endeavoured to console his w  for  is and exhort her to a life of  vering virtue that she seemed resolved on not surviving him and prest her request to die with him so earnestly that Seneca who had long looked upon death as a benefit at last gave his consent and the veins of both their arms were opened at the same  time As Seneca was old and much enfeebled by one austerities of his life the blood flowed but slowin  so that he caused the veins of his legs and thighs  be opened also His pains were long and violent but they were not capable of repressing his fortitude  his eloquence He dictated a discourse to two s  reta  ies which was read with great avidity after his death by the people but which has since perish  bl  in the wreck of time His agonies being now drawn out to a great length he at last demanded person from his physician but this also failed of its effect his body being already exhausted and in  p  le of exciting its operation He was from this  ed into a warm bath which only served to pro  ng his end at length therefore he was put into  y stove the vapour of which quickly dispatched  In the mean time his wife Paulina having m  n into a swoon with the loss of blood had her was bound up by her domestics and by this means  ived her husband for some years but by her con  ct during the rest of her life she seemed always thankful of her own love and his example  The death of Lucan was not less remarkable T  v  ns of his arms being opened after he had  great quantiy of blood perceiving his hands  l  gs already dead while the vital parts still con  warm and vigorous he called to mind a de  pt in his own poem of the Pharsalia of  dying in similar circumstances and expired  e he was repeating that beautiful passage  Nec sicut vulnere sanguis  cuit lentus Ruptis calit undique venis  Pars ultima trunci  in cetum vacuos vitalibus artus  mil  s qua pulmo jacet qua viscera s  rvent  unt  oi tata  lu Luctataque multum  parte vici vix omnia membra tulerunt  U C AD  The death of Petronius about this time is too remarkable to be past over in silence This person whom many modern historians suppose to be the author of a work of no great merit intituledSatyricon which is still remaining was an Epicurcan both in principle and practice In so luxurious a court as that of Nero he was particularly noted for his refinements in luxury He was accused of being privy to Piso's conspiracy and committed to prison Petronius could not endure the anxiety of suspense wherefore he resolved upon putting himself to death which he performed in a manner entirely similar to that in which he had lived He opened his veins and then closed them as he thought least painful with the utmost chearfulness and tranquility He conversed with his friends not upon maxims of philosophy or grave subjects but upon such topics as had amused his gayest revels He listened while they recited the lightest poems and by no action no word nor circumstance shewed the perplexity of a dying person Shortly after him Numicius Thermus was put to death as likewise Barea Scranus and P  tus Thrasea The destroying the two last Tacitus calls an attack upon virtue itself Thrasea died in the midst of his friends and philosophers conversing and reasoning on the nature of the soul His wife who was the daughter of the celebrated Arria was desirous of following her mother  s example but he dissuaded her from it The death of the valiant Corbulo who had gained Nero so many victories over the Part  i  f  lowed next Nor did the empress Poppea herself escape whom in a sit of anger he kicked when s  e was pregnant by which she miscarried and di  d At length human nature grew weary of bearing her persecutor and the whole world seemed to  ou  e as if by common consent to rid the earth of a monster  Sergius Galba who was at that time governor of Sp  in was remarkable for his wisdom in peace and his courage in war but as all talents under corrupt princes are dangerous he for some years had seemed willing to court obscurity giving himself up to an inactive life and avoiding all opportunity of signali  ing his valour  But willing to rid his country of a monster he accepted the invitation of Vindex to march with an army towards Rome The reputation of that general was such that from the moment be declared against Nero that tyrant considered himself as undone He received the account as he was at supper and instantly struck with terror overturned the table with his foot breaking two crystal vases of immense value He then fell into a swoon from which when he recovered he tore his cloaths and struck his head crying out  that he was utterly undone  He now therefore called for Locusta to furnish him with poison and thus prepared for the worst he retired to the Servelian gardens with a resolution of flying into Egypt Being prevented in  and the revolt becoming general he went in person from house to house but all the doors were that against him and none were found to answer his enquiries Being now reduced to a state of desperation he desired that one of his favourite gladiators might come and dispatch him but even in this re  t there was none found to obey "Alas" died he "have I neither friend nor enemy" And  nning desperately forth seemed resolved to  headlong into the Tiber But just then his  beginning to sail him he made a sudden  if willing to recollect his reason and asked  secret place where he might reassume his  and meet death with becoming fortitude  distress Phaon one of his freedmen offered  countryhouse▪ about at four miles distant  where he might for some time remain concealed Nero accepted his offer and half dressed as he was with his head covered and hiding his face with his handkerchief he mounted on horseback attended by four of his domestics of whom the wretched Sporus was one His journey though short was crowded with adventures An earthquake gave him the first alarm The lightning from Heaven next flashed in his face Round him he heard nothing but confused noises from the camp and the cries of the soldiers imprecating a thousand evils upon his head A passenger meeting him on the way cried "There go men in pursuit of Nero" Another asked him if there was any news of Nero in the city His horse taking flight at a dead body that lay rear the road he dropped his handkerchief and a soldier who was near addressed him by name He now therefore quitted his horse and forsaking the highway entered a thicket that led towards the back part of Phaon's house through which he crept making the best of his way among the reeds and brambles with which the place was overgrown During this interval the senate finding the praetorian guards had taken part with Galba declared him emperor and condemned Nero to die "more majorum" that is according to the rigour of the ancient laws When he was told of the resolution of the senate against him he asked the messenger what was meant by being punished according to the rigour of the ancient laws To this he was answered that the criminal was to be stripped naked his head was to be fixed in a pillory and in that posture he was to be scourged to death Nero was so terrified at this that he seized two poniards which he had brought with him and examining their points returned them to their sheaths pretending that the fatal moment was not yet arrived He then desired Sporus to begin the lamentations which were used at funerals  he next entreated that some of his attendants would di  to give him courage by his example and afterwards began to reproach his own cowardice crying out  Does this become Nero Is this trifling well timed No no let me be courageous  In fact he had no time to spare for the soldiers who had been  nt in pursuit of him were just then approaching the house wherefore hearing the sound of the horses feet he set a dagger to his throat with which by the assistance of Epaphroditus his freedman and secretary he gave himself a mortal wound However he was not yet quite dead when one of the centurions entering the room and pretending he came to his relief attempted to stop the blood with his cloak But Nero regarding him with a stern countenance said  It is now too late Is this your fidelity  Upon which with his eyes fixed and f  ightfully staring he expired even in death a ghastly spectacle of innoxious tyranny  He reigned thirteen years seven months and twentyeight days and died in the thirtysecond year of his age  Galba was seventytwo years old when he was declared emperor  U C AD  and was then in Spain with his legions However he soon found that his being raised to the throne was but an inlet to new disquietudes He seemed to have three objects in view To curb the insolence of the soldiers to punish those vices which had come to an enormous height in the last reign and to replenish the exhequer which had been quite drained by the prodigality of his predecessors However permitting himself to be governing by favourites he at one time shewed himself severe and frugal at another remiss and prodigal condemning some illustrious persons without any hearing and pardoning others though guilty In consequence  of this many seditions were kindled and several factions promoted in different parts of the empire but particularly in Germany  Galba being informed of these commotions was sensible that beside his age he was less re  pected for want of an heir He resolved therefore to put what he had in fo  erly de  gned in execution and to adopt some person whose virtues  deserve such advancement and perfect his declining age from danger His favourites underst  nding his determination instantly  ing him an heir of their own ch  ing s  th  t there arose a great contention among them  Otho made warm applica  ion for hims  f alledging the great services he had done the empe  r as being the first men of note who came to his  stance when he had declared against Nero However Galba being fully resolved to consult the public good alone rejected his suit and on a day appointed ordered Piso Lucinianus to attend him The character given by historians of Piso is that he was every way worth of the honour designed him He was no way related to Galba and had no other interest but merit to recommend him to his favour Taking this youth therefore by the hand in the presence of his friends he adopted him to succeed in the empire giving him the most wholesome less  ns for guiding his future conduct Piso's conduct shewed that he was highly deserving this distinction in all his deportment there appeared such modesty firmness and equality of mind as bespoke him rather capable of discharging than ambitious of obtaining his present dignity But the army and the senate did not seem equally disinterested upon this occasion they had been so long used to bribery and corruption that they could now bear no emperor who was not in a capacity of satisfying their avarice The adoption  therefore of Piso was but coldly received for his  were no recommendation in a nation of uni  s  l depravity  Otho who had long been a favourite of Galba  h  ping to be adopted his successor in the em  finding his hopes disappointed and still fur  stimulated by the immense load of debt which  contracted by his riotous way of living resolv  upon obtaining the empire by force since he could not by peaceable succession Having corrupt  the fidelity of the soldiers he stole secretly from the emperor while he was sacrificing and assemb  g the soldiers in a short speech urged the cruel  and the avarice of Galba Finding his in  received with universal shouts by the whole  he entirely threw off the mask and avowed his intentions of dethroning him The soldiers being ripe for sedition immediately seconded his views  Otho upon their shoulders immediately d  lared him emperor and to strike the citizens  te  ror carried him with their swords drawn i  the camp  after finding the emperor in some measure  by his adherents the soldiers rushed in up  trampling the crowds of people that then  the forum under foot Galba seeing them  seemed to recollect all his former fortit  and bending his head forward bid the as  strike it off if it were for the good of the  This was quickly performed and his head  set upon the point of a launce was presented to Otho who ordered it to be contemptuously car  ound the camp his body remaining unburied in t  eet    A D  till it was interred by one of his  He died in the seventy third year of his age after a short reign of seven months as illustrious by his own virtues as it was contaminated  by the vices of his favourites who shared in his downfall  Otho who was now elected emperor began his reign by a signal instance of clemency in pardoning Marius Celsus who had been highly favoured by Galba and not contented with barely forgiving he advanced him to the highest honours asserting that "fidelity deserved every reward"  In the mean time the legions in Lower Germany having been purchased by the large gifts and specious promises of Vitellius their general were at length induced to proclaim him emperor and regardless of the senate they declared that they had an equal right to appoint to that high station with the cohorts at Rome  Otho departed from Rome with all haste to give Vitellius battle The army of Vitellius which consisted of seventy thousand men was commanded by his generals Valens and Cecina he himself remaining in Gaul in order to bring up the rest of his forces Both sides hastened to meet each other with so much animosity and precipitation that three considerable battles were fought in the space of three days One near Placentia another near Cremona and a third at a place called Castor in all which Otho and the Romans had the advantage But these successes were but of shortlived continuance for Valens and Cecinia who had hitherto acted separately joining their forces and reinforcing their armies with fresh supplies resolved to come to a general engagement In this Otho's forces were totally overthrown and he killed himself shortly after having reigned three months and five days  A D  Vitellius was immediately after declared emperor by the senate and received the marks of distinction which were now accustomed to follow the appointments of the strongest side  Upon his arrival at Rome he entered the city not as a place he came to govern with justice but as a town that was become his own by the laws of conquest  Vitellius soon gave himself up to all kinds of luxury and profuseness but gluttony was his favourite vice so that he brought himself to an habit a  vomiting in order to be able to renew his meals a  pleasure His entertainments though seldom at  cost were prodigiously expensive he fre  ntly invited himself to the tables of his subjects  s  sting with one dining with another and  pping with a third all in the same day  By the continuance of such vices added to enor  cruelties he became not only a burden to  but odious to all mankind Thus having  insupportable to the inhabitants of Rome  of the east who had at first acquiesced  dominion began to revolt and short  unanimously resolved to make Vespasian    the preparations against him Vitellius  ried in sloth and luxury was resolved to  effort to defend the empire wherefore his  mmanders Valens and Cecinna were or  make all possible preparations to refill the  The first army that entered Italy with an  intention was under the command of An  ius Primus who was met by Cecinna near Cre  na A battle was expected to ensue but a negotiation taking place Cecinna was prevailed upon to  sides and declare for Vespasian His army however quickly repented of what they had done  imprisoning their general attacked Antonius though without a leader The engagement continued during the whole night and in the morning after a short repast both armies engaged a second time when the soldiers of Antonius saluting the  rising sun according to custom the Vitellians supposing that they had received new reinforcements betook themselves to flight with the lose of thirty thousand men  In the mean time Vitellius who was wallowing in all kinds of luxury and excess made offers to Vespasian of resigning the empire provided his life were spared and a sufficient revenue allotted for his support In order to enforce this request he issued from his palace in deep mourning with all his domestics weeping round him He then went to offer the sword of justice to Cecilius the consul which he refusing the abject emperor prepared to lay down the ensigns of empire in the temple of Concord but being interrupted by some who cried out that he himself was Concord he resolved upon so weak an encouragement  ll to maintain his power and immediately prepared for his defence  During this fluctuation of counsels one Sabinus who had advised Vitellius to resign perceiving his desperate situation resolved by a bold step to oblige Vespasian and accordingly seized upon the Capitol But he was premature in his attempt for the soldiers of Vitellius attacked him with great fury and prevailing by their numbers soon laid that beautiful building in ashes During this dreadful conflagration Vitellius was fea  ing in the palace of Tiberius and beholding all the horrors of the assault with great satisfaction Sabinus was taken prisoner and shortly after executed by the emperor's command Young Domitian his nephew who was afterwards emperor escaped by slight in the habit of a priest and all the rest who survived the fire were put to the sword  But Antonius Vespasian's commander being arrived before the walls of the city the forces of Vitellius resolved upon defending it to the utmost extremity It was attacked on three sides with  the utmost fury while the army within sallying upon the besiegers defended it with equal obstinacy The battle lasted a whole day till at last the besieged were driven into the city and a dreadful slaughter made of them in all the streets which they vainly attempted to defend  Vitellius was soon sound hidden in an obscure  n  r from whence he was taken by a party of the conquering soldiers Still however willing to add a few hours more to his miserable life he begged to be kept in prison till the arrival of Vespasian at Rome pretending that he had secrets of importance to discover But his intreaties were vain the soldiers binding his hands behind him and throwing an halter round his neck led him along half naked into the public forum upbraiding him as they proceeded with all those bitter reproaches their malice could suggest or his own cruelty might deserve At l  ngth being come to the place of punishment they killed him with many blows and then dragging the dead body through the streets with an hook they threw it with all possible ignominy into the river Tyb  r  Vespasian was now declared emperor  AD  by the unanimous consent both of the senate and the army and dignified with all those titles which now followed rather the power than the merit of those who were appointed to govern  Having continued some months at Alexandria in Egypt where it is said he cured a blind and a lime man by touching them he set out for Rome giving his son Titus the command of the army that was to lay siege to Jerusalem while he himself went forward and was met many miles from Rome by all the senate and near half the inhabitants who gave the sincerest testimonies of their joy in having an emperor of such great and experienced virtues Nor did he in the least disappoint their expectations  being equally assiduous in rewarding merit and pardoning his adversaries in reforming the manners of the citizens and setting them the best example in his own  In the mean time Titus carried on the war against the Jews with vigour This obstinate and infatuated people had long resolved to resist the Roman power vainly hoping to find protection from Heaven which their impieties had utterly offended Their own historian represents them as arrived at the highest pitch of iniquity while famines earthquakes and prodigies all conspired to forewarn their approaching ruin Nor was it sufficient that Heaven and earth seemed combined against them they had the most bitter dissensions among themselves and were split into two parties that robbed and destroyed each other with impunity still pillaging and at the same time boasting their zeal for the religion of their ancestors  At the head of one of those parties was an incendiary whose name was John This fanatic affected sovereign power and filled the whole city of Jerusalem and all the towns around with tumult and pillage In a short time a new faction arose headed by one Simon who gathering together multitudes of robbers and murderers who had fled to the mountains attacked many cities and towns and reduced all Idumea into his power Jerusalem at length became the theatre in which these two demagogues began to exercise their mutual animosity John was possessed of the temple while Simon was admitted into the city both equally enraged against each other while slaughter and devastation followed their pretensions Thus did a city formerly celebrated for peace and unity become the seat of tumult and confusion  It was in this miserable situation that Titus began his operations within about six furlongs of the  city of Jerusalem during the feast of the Passover when the place was filled with an infinite multitude of people who had come from all parts to celebrate that great solemnity The approach of the Romans produced a temporary reconciliation between the contending factions within the city so that they unanimously resolved to oppose the common enemy first and then decide their domestic quarrels at a more convenient season Their first f  lly which was made with much fury and resolution put the besiegers into great disorder and obliged them to abandon their camp and fly to the mountains However rallying immediately after the Jews were forced back into the city while Titus in person shewed surprising instances of valour and conduct  These advantages over the Romans only renewed in the besieged their desires of private revenge A tumult ensued in the temple in which several of both parties were slain and in this manner upon every remission from without the factions of John and Simon violently raged against each other within agreeing only in their resolution to defend the city against the Romans  The city was strongly fortified by three walls on every side except where it was fenced by deep val  es Titus began by battering down the outward well which after much fatigue and danger he effected all the time shewing the greatest clemency to the Jews and offering them repeated assurances of  Five days after the commencement of the siege Titus broke through the second wall and though driven back by the besieged he recovered  ground and made preparations for battering the third wall which was their last defence But first he sent Josephus their countryman into the city to exhort them to yield who using all his eloquence to persuade them was only reviled with scoffs and  reproaches The siege was now therefore carried on with greater vigour than before several batteries for engines were raised which were no sooner built than destroyed by the enemy At length it was resolved in council to surround the whole city with a trench and thus prevent all relief and succours from abroad This which was quickly executed seemed no way to intimidate the Jews Though famine and pestilence its necessary attendant began now to make the most horrid ravages among them yet this desperate people still resolved to hold out He now cut down all the woods within a considerable distance of the city and causing more batteries to be raised he at length battered down the wall and in five days entered the citadel by force The Jews however continued to deceive themselves with absurd and false expectations while many false prophets deluded the multitude declaring they should soon have assistance from God The heat of the battle was now therefore gathered round the inner wall of the temple while the defendants desperately combated from the top Titus was willing to save this beautiful structure but a soldier casting a brand into some adjacent buildings the fire communicated to the temple and notwithstanding the utmost endeavours on both sides the whole edifice was quickly consumed The fight of the temple in ruins effectually served to damp the ardour of the Jews They now began to perceive that Heaven had forsaken them while their cries and lamentations echoed from the adjacent mountains Even those who were almost expiring lifted up their dying eyes to bewail the loss of their temple which they valued more than life itself The most resolute however still endeavoured to defend the upper and stronger part of the city named Sion but Titus with his battering engines soon made himself entire master of the pl  John and Simon were taken from the  vaults where they had concealed themselves the former was condemned to perpetual imprisonment and the latter reserved to grace the conqueror's triumph The greatest part of the populace were put to the swo  d and the city was after a six month's siege entirely razed by the plough so that according to our S  viour's prophecy not one stone remained upon  The numbers who perished in this siege  to Josephus amounted to above a mil  of souls and the captives to almost an hundred    Upon the taking of Jerusalem his soldiers would have crowned Titus as conqueror but he modestly  the honour alledging that he was only an instrument in the hand of Heaven that manifestly declared its wrath against the Jews At Rome however all mens mouths were filled with the praises of the conqueror who had not only shewn himself an excellent general but a courageous combatant his return therefore in triumph which he  d with his father was marked with all the magnificence and joy that was in the power men to express All things that were esteemed valuable or beautiful among men were brought to adorn this great occasion Among the rich spoils were exposed vast quantities of gold taken out of the temple but the book of the Holy Law was not the least remarkable among the magnificent profusion This was the first time that ever Rome saw the father and the son triumph together A triumphal arch was erected upon this occasion on which were described all the  ete  ies of Titus over the Jews which remains almost entire to this very day Vespasian likewise  a temple to Peace wherein were deposited most of the Jewish spoils and having now calmed all commotions in every part of the empire he shut up t  temple of Janus which had been open about five or six years  Few emperors have received a better character from historians than Vespasian yet all his numerous acts of generosity and magnificence could not preserve his character from the imputation of rapacity and avarice He descended to some very unusual and dishonourable imposts even to the laying a tax upon urine When his son Titus remonstrated against the meanness of such a tax Vespasian taking a piece of money demanded if the smell offended him adding that this very money was produced by urine  Notwithstanding having reigned ten years loved by his subjects and deserving their affection he was surprised with an indisposition at Campania which from the beginning he declared would be fatal and perceiving his end approaching as he was just going to expire he cried out that an emperor ought to die standing wherefore raising himself upon his feet he expired in the hands of those that sustained him  AD  Titus being joyfully received as emperor began to reign with the practice of every virtue that became a sovereign and a man During the life of his father there had been many imputations against him both for cruelty lust and prodigality but upon his exaltation to the throne he seemed entirely to take leave of his former vices and became an example of the greatest moderation and humanity His first step towards gaining the affections of his subjects was his moderating his passions and bridling his strong inclinations He had long loved Berenice sister to Agrippa king of Judaea a woman of the greatest beauty and refined allurements But knowing that the connection with her was entirely disagreeable to the people of Rome he gained a victory over his affections and sent her away notwithstanding their mutual passion and the many arts she used to induce him to change his resolutions  He next discarded all those who had been the former ministers of his pleasures and forbore to countenance the companions of his looser recreations though he had formerly taken great pains in the selection This moderation added to his justice and generosity procured him the love of all good men and the appellation of the Delight of Mankind which all his actions seemed caculated to ensure  Titus took particular care to punish all informers false witnesses and promoters of dissension Those wretches who had their rise in the licentiousness and impunity of former reigns were now become so  merous that their crimes called loudly for punishment Of these therefore he daily made public examples condemning them to be scourged in the most public streets next to be dragged through the theatre and then to be banished into the uninhabited parts of the empire or sold as slaves His courtesy and readiness to do good have been celebrated even i  Christian writers his principal rule being never to send any petitioner dissatisfied away One night recollecting that he had done nothing beneficial to mankind the day preceding he cried out among his friends "I have lost a day" A sentence too re  ble not to be universally known  Learning that two noblemen had conspired against  he readily forgave them and the next day  them next himself in the theatre he put the  with which the gladiators fought into their  demanding their judgement and approbation  ther they were of sufficient length  t  is reign an eruption of mount Vesuvius did  damage overwhelming many towns  throwing its ashes into countries more than an  ndred miles distant Upon this memorable occa  Pl  ny the naturalist lost his life for being  p  lled by too eager a curiosity to observe the  eruption he was suffocated in the flames There happened also about this time a fire at Rome which continued three days and nights successively being followed by a plague in which ten thousand men were buried in a day The emperor however did all that lay in his power to repair the damages sustained by the public and with respect to the city declared that he would take the whole loss of that upon himself  These disasters were in some measure counterbalanced by the successes in Britain under Agricola This excellent general having been sent into that country towards the latter end of Vespasian's reign shewed himself equally expert in quelling the refractory and civi  izing th  se who had formerly submitted t  the Roman power The Old vices or inhabitants of North Wales were the first that were subdued H  th  made a descent upon Mona or the i  and of  which surrendered at discretion Ha  ing

the people  AD  as he appeared equally remarkable for his clemency libera  ty and justice  But he soon began to shew the natural deformity of h  s mind Instead of cultivating literature as  father and brother had done he neglected all  of study addicting himself wholly to meaner  suits particularly archery and gaming He was it very expert an archer that he would frequently  one of his slaves to

every day to encrease with the  f his reign His ungrateful treatment of  se  med the first symptom of his natural  D  mi  ian was alway  particularly f  nd  a mi  itary  eputation and therefore  jealous of it in others He had marched some time before into Gaul upon a pretended expedition against the Catti a people of Germany and without ever seeing the enemy resolved to have the honour of a triumph upon his return to Rome For that purpose he purchased a number of slaves whom he dressed in German habits and at the head of this miserable procession entered the city amidst the apparent acclamations and concealed contempt of all his subjects The successes therefore of Aricola in Britain affected him with an extreme degree of envy This admirable general pursued the advantages which he had already obtained He subdued the Caledonians and overcame Galgacus the British chief at the head of thirty thousand men and afterwards sending out a fleet to scour the coast first discovered Great Britain to be an island He likewise discovered and subdued the Orkneys and thus reduced the whole into a civilized province of the Roman empire When the account of these successes was brought to Domitian he received it with a seeming pleasure but real uneasiness He thought Agricola's rising reputation a tacit reproach upon his own inactivity and instead of attempting to emulate he resolved to suppress the merit of his services He ordered him therefore external marks of approbation and took care that triumphant ornaments statues and other honours should be decreed him but at the same time he removed him from his command under a pretence of appointing him to the government of Syria By these means Agricola surrendered up his province to Sal  stius Lucui  us but s  n found that Syria was otherwise disposed of Upon his return to Rome which was privately and by r  ght he was  tly received by the emperor and dying some time after in retirement it was supp  sed by  me that was his end was hastened by Domi  an's direction  Domitian soon after found the want of so experienced a commander in the many irruptions of the barbarous nations that surrounded the empire The Sarmatians in Europe joined with those of Asia made a formidable invasion at once destroying a whole legion and a general of the Romans The Dacians under the conduct of Decebalus their king made an irruption and overthrew the Romans in several engagements At last however the barbarians were repelled partly by force and partly by the assistance of money which only served to enable them to make future invasions with greater advantage But in whatever manner the enemy might ha  e been repelled Domitian was resolved not to  se the honours of a triumph He returned in great splendor to Rome and not contented with thus triumphing twice without a victory he resolved to take the surname of Germanicus for his conquests over a people with whom he never contended  In proportion as the ridicule encreased against him his pride seemed every day to demand greater hom  e He would permit his statues to be made only of g  d and silver he assumed to himself divine honours  ordered that all men should treat him with the  appellations which they gave to the divinity His c  uelty was not behind his arrogance he caused  of the most illustrious senators and others  put to death upon the most trifling pretences  ius Lama

in which he commended  Thrasea and Priscus two philosophers who opposed Vespasian's coming to throne  Lucius Antonius governor of Upper Germany knowing how much the emperor was detested at home resolved upon striking for the throne and accordingly assumed the ensigns of imperial dignity As he was at the head of a formidable army his success remained a long time doubtful but a sudden overflowing of the Rhine dividing his army he was set upon at that juncture by Normandus the emperor's general and totally routed The news of this victory we are told was brought to Rome by supernatural means on the same day that the battle was fought Domitian's severity was greatly encreased by this shortlived success In order to discover those who were accomplices with the adverse party he invented new tortures sometimes cutting off the hands at other times thrusting fire into the privities of those whom  e suspected of being his enemies During his severities he aggravated his guilt by hypocrisy never pronouncing sentence without a preamble full of gentleness and mercy The night before he crucified the comptroller of his houshold he treated him with the most seeming friendship and ordered him a dish of meat from his own table He carried A  tinus Clemens with him in his own latter the  had concluded upon his death He was par  ic  larly t  rrible to the senate and nobility the whole  of whom he frequently threatened to  et  rp  e ent  ly At one time he surrounded the senate  with his troops to the great consternation of the senators At another he resolved to  use him self with their terrors in a different manner Having invited them to a public entertainment he received them all very formally at the entrance of his palace and conducted them into a spaci  us ha  hung round with black and illuminated by a few melancholy lamps that diffused light only  sufficient to shew the horrors of the place All around were to be seen nothing but coffins with the names of each of the senators written upon them together with other objects of terror and instruments of execution While the company beheld all these preparations with silent agony several men having their bodies blackened each with a drawn sword in one hand and a flaming torch in the other entered the hall and danced round them After some time when the guests expected nothing less than the most instant death well knowing Domitian's capricious cruelty the doors were set open and one of the servants came to inform them that the emperor gave all the company leave to withdraw  These cruelties were rendered still more odious by his lust and avarice Frequently after presiding at an execution he would retire with the lewdest prostitutes and use the same baths which they did The last part of the tyrant's reign was more insupp  table than any of the preceding Nero exercised  cruelties without being a spectator but a principal part of the Roman miseries during his reign was to see and be seen to behold the stern air and fr  visage of the tyrant which he had armed against  hing by continued intemperance directing the t  tures and maliciously pleased with adding p  gnance to every agony  But a period was soon to be put to this monster's cruelties Among the number of those whom he at  e caressed and suspected was his wife Domitia w  m he had taken from Aelius Lama her former  It was the tyrant's method to put dnwn the names of all such as he intended to destroy in  tablets which he kept about him with great circumspection Domitia fortunately happening to g  t  sight of them was struck at finding her own name in the catalogue of those fated to destruction  She shewed the fatal list to Norbanus and Petronius praefects of the praetorian bands who found themselves set down as likewise to Stephanus the comptroller of the houshold who came into the conspiracy with alacrity They fixed upon the eighteenth day of September for the completion of their great attempt Upon preparing to go to the bath on the morning of that day Petronius his chamberlain came to inform him that Stephanus the comptroller of the houshold desired to speak to him upon an affair of the utmost importance The emperor having given orders that his attendants should retire Stephanus entered with his hand in a scarf which he had worn thus for some days the better to conceal a dagger as none were permitted to approach the emperor with arms He began by giving information of a pretended conspiracy and exhibited a paper in which the particulars were specified While Domitian was reading the contents with an eager curiosity Stephanus drew his dagger and struck him in the groin The wound not being mortal Domitian caught hold of the assassin and threw him upon the ground calling out for assistance But Parthenius with his freedman a gladiator and two subaltern officers now coming in they ran all furiously upon the emperor and dispatched him with seven wounds  It is almost incredible what some writers relate concerning Appollonious Tyaneus who was then at Ephenus This person whom some call a magician and some a philosopher but who more probably was nothing more than an impostor was just at the minute in which Domitian was stain lecturing in one of the public gardens of the city But stopping short all of a sudden he cried out  Courage Stephanus strike the tyrant  And then after a pause  Rejoice my friends the tyrant dies this  day this day do I say the very moment in which I kept silence he suffers for his crimes he dies  Many more prodigies were said to have portended his death but the fate of such a monster seemed to produce more preternatural disturbances and more predictions than it deserved The truth seems to be that a belief in omens and prodigies were again become prevalent the people were again relapsing into pristine barbarity a country of ignorance is ever the proper soil for an harvest of imposture  CHAP XXIII The five good Emperors of Rome A D  WHEN it was publicly known that Domitian was slain the senate began to load his memory with every reproach His statues were commanded to be taken down and a decree was made that all his inscriptions should be erased his name struck out of the registers of Fame and his funeral omitted The people who now took little part in the affairs of government looked on his death with indifference the soldiers alone whom he had  aded with favours and enriched by largesses sincerely regretted their benefactor  The senate therefore resolved to provide a successor before the army could have an opportunity of t  king the appointment upon themselves and Coc  ius Nerva was chosen to the empire the vary  y on watch the tyrant was slain He was of an illustrious family as most say by birth a Spaniard and above f  tyfive years old when he was called to the throne He was at that time the most remarkable man in  Rome for his virtues moderation and respect to the laws and he owed his exaltation to the blameless conduct of his former life  The people being long accustomed to tyranny they regarded Nerva's gentle reign with rapture and even gave his imbecility for his humanity was carried too far for justice the name of benevolence Upon coming to the throne he solemnly swore that no senator of Rome should be put to death by his command during his reign though they gave never so just a cause This oath he so religiously observed that when two senators had conspired his death he used no kind of severity against them but sending for them to let them see he was not ignorant of their designs he carried them with him to the public theatre there presenting each a dagger he desired them to strike as he was determined not to ward off the blow  During his short reign he made several good laws He particularly prohibited the castration of male children which had been likewise condemned by his predecessor but not wholly removed He put all those slaves to death who had during the last reign informed against their masters He permitted no statues to be erected in his honour and converted such of Domitian's as had been spared by the senate into money He sold many rich robes and much of the splendid furniture of the palace and retrenched several unreasonable expences at court At the same time he had so little regard for money that when one of his subjects found a large treasure and wrote to the emperor how to dispose of it he received for answer that he might use it but the finder still informing the emperor that it was a fortune too large for a private person Nerva admiring his honesty wrote him word that then he might abuse it  A life of such generosity and mildness was not however without its enemies Vigilius Rufus who had opposed him was not only pardoned but made his colleague in the consulship Calpurnius Crassus also with some others formed a conspiracy to destroy him but he rested satisfied with banishing those who were culpable though the senate were for inflicting more rigorous punishments But the most dangerous insurrection against his interests was from the praetorian bands who headed by Casparius Olianus insisted upon revenging the late emperor's death whose memory was still dear to them from his frequent liberalities Nerva whose kindness to good men rendered him more obnoxious to the vicious did all in his power to stop the progress of this insurrection he presented himself to the mutinous soldiers and opening his bosom desired them to strike there rather than be guility of so such injustice The soldiers however paid no regard to his remonstrances but seizing upon Petronius and Parthenius slew them in the most ignominious manner Not content with this they even compelled the emperor to approve of their sedition and to make a speech to the people in which he thanked the cohorts for their fidelity  So disagreeable a constraint upon the emperor's inclinations was in the end attended with the  happy effects as it caused the adoption of Tr  ian to succeed him For perceiving that i  the present turbulent disposition of the times he stood in need of an assistant in the empire  ing aside all his own relations he fixed upon Ulpius Trajan an utter stranger to his family who was then governor in Upper Germany as his succ  ssor And in about three months after having not himself into a violent passion with one Regulus  senator he was seized with a fever of which he  died after a short reign of one year four months and nine days  He was the first foreign emperor who reigned in Rome and justly reputed a prince of great generosity and moderation He is also celebrated for his wisdom though with less reason the greatest instance he gave of it during his reign being the choice of his successor  U C A D  Trajan's family was originally from Italy but he himself was born at Seville in Spain Upon being informed of the death of Nerva he prepared to return to Rome from Germany where he was governor and one of the first lectures he received upon his arrival was from Plutarch the philosopher who had the honour of being his master and is said to have written him a letter to the following purpose  Since your merits and not your importunities have advanced you to the empire permit me to congratulate your virtues and my own good fortune If your future government proves answerable to your former worth I shall be happy But if you become worse for power yours will be the danger and mine the ignominy of your conduct The errors of the pupil will be charged upon his instructor Seneca is reproached for the enormities of Nero and Socrates and Quintillian have not escaped censure for the misconduct of their respective scholars But you have it in your power to make me the most honoured of men by continuing what you are Continue the command of your passions and make virtue the scope of all your actions If you follow these instructions then will I glory in my having presumed to give them if you neglect what I offer then will this letter be my testimony that you have not erred through the council and authority of Plutarch  I have inserted  this letter whether genuine or not because it seems to me well written and a striking picture of this greatest philosopher's manner of addressing that best of princes  This good monarch's application to business his moderation to his enemies his modesty in exaltation his liberality to the deserving and his frugality in his own expences have all been the subject of panegyric among his cotemporaries and they continue to be the admiration of posterity  Upon giving the prefect of the praetorian bands the sword according to custom he made use of this remarkable expression  Take this sword and use it if I have merit for me if otherwise against me  After which he added that he who gave laws was first who was bound to observe them  The first war he was engaged in after his coming to the throne was with the Dacians who during the reign of Domitian had committed numberless ravages upon the provinces of the empire He therefore raised a powerful army and with great expedition marched into those barbarous countries where he was vigorously opposed by Decebalus the Dacian king who for a long time withstood his boldest efforts At length however this monarch being cnstrained to come to a general battle and no longer able to protract the war he was routed with great slaugther though not without great loss to the conqueror The Roman soldiers upon this occasion wanting linen to bind up their wounds the emperor tore his own robes to supply them This victory compelled the enemy to sue for peace which they obtained upon very disadvantageous terms their king coming into the Roman camp and acknowledging himself a vassal of the Roman empire  Upon Trajan's return after the usual triumphs and rejoicings upon such an occasion were over he was surprised with an account that the Dacians had renewed hostilities Decebalus their king was now therefore a second time adjudged an enemy to the Roman state and Trajan invaded his dominions with an army equal to that with which he had before subdued him But Decebalus now grown more cautious by his former defeat used every art to avoid coming to an engagement He also put various stratagems in practice to distress the enemy and at one time Trajan himself was in danger of being slain or taken He also took Longinus one of the Roman generals prisoner and threatened to kill him in case Trajan refused granting him terms of peace But the emperor replied that peace and war had not their dependence upon the safety of one subject only wherefore Longinus some time after destroyed himself by a voluntary death The sate of this general seemed to give new vigour to Trajan's operations In order to be better enabled to invade the enemy's territories at pleasure he undertook a most stupendous work which was no less than building a bridge across the Danube This amazing structure which was built over a deep broad and rapid river consisted of more than twentytwo arches an hundred and fifty feet high and an hundred and seventy broad the ruins of this structure which remain to this day shew modern architects how far they were surpassed by the ancients both in the greatness and the boldness of their designs Upon finishing this work Trajan continued the war with great vigour sharing with the meanest of his soldiers the fatigues of the campaign and continually encouraging them to their duty by his own example By these means notwithstanding the country was spacious and uncultivated and the inhabitants brave and hardy he  subdued the whole and added the kingdom of Dacia as a province to the Roman empire Decebalus made some attempts to escape but being surrounded on every side he at last slew himself and h  s head was sent immediately to Rome to certify his misfortune there These successes seemed to advance the empire to a greater degree of splendour that it had hitherto acquired Ambassadors were  n to come from the interior parts of India to con  tu  ate Trajan's success and bespeak his friendship At his return to Rome he entered the city in tri  ph and the rejoicings for his victories lasted for  e space of an hundred and twenty days  Having given peace and prosperity to the empire he continued his reign loved honoured and almost  ted by his subjects He adorned the city with pr  buildings he freed it from such men as lived at their vices he entertained persons of merit with t  e utmost familiarity and so little feared his enemies that he could scarcely be induced to suppose he  any  It had been happy for this great prince's memory if he had shewn equal clemency to all his subjects but about the ninth year of his reign he was persuaded to look upon the Christians with a susp  s eye  U C A D  and great numbers of them were put to death as well by popular tumults as by edicts and judicial proceedings However the persecution ceased after some time for  emperor having advice from Pliny the proconsul in Bithynia of the innocence and simplicity of  e Christians and of their inoffensive and moral way of living he suspended their punishments  During this emperor's reign there was a dreadful insurrection of the Jews in all parts of the empire Th  wretched people still infatuated and ever expecting some signal deliverance took the advantage  f Trajan's absence in the East in an expedition he  had undertaken against the Armenians and Parthians to massacre all the Greeks and Romans which they got into their power without reluctance or mercy This rebellion first began in Cyrene a Roman province in Africa from thence the flame extended to Egypt and next to the island of Cyprus These places they in a manner dispeopled with ungovernable fury Their barbarities were such that they eat the flesh of their enemies wore their skins sawed them asunder cast them to wild beasts made them kill each other and studied new torments by which to destroy them However these cruelties were of no long duration the governors of the respective provinces making head against their tumultuous fury soon treated them with a retaliation of cruelty and put them to death not as human beings but as outrageous pests to society As the Jews had practised their cruelties in Cyprus particularly a law was publicly enacted by which it was made capital for any Jew to set foot on the island  During these bloody transactions Trajan was prosecuting his successes in the East where he carried the Roman arms farther than they had ever been before but resolving to return once more to Rome he found himself too weak to proceed in his usual manner He therefore ordered himself to be carried on shipboard to the city of Salcucia where he died of the apoplexy  A D  having been attacked by that disorder once before in the sixtythird year of his age after a reign of nineteen years six months and fifteen days  Adrian who was nephew to Trajan was adopted to succeed in the empire and elected by all orders of the state though absent from Rome being then at Antioch as general of the forces in the East  Upon his election he began to pursue a course quite opposite to that of his predecessor taking every  method of declining war and promoting the arts of peace He was quite satisfied with preserving the ancient limits of the empire and seemed no way ambitious of extensive conquest  Adrian was one of the most remarkable of the Roman emperors for the variety of his endowments He was highly skilful in all the accomplishments both of body and mind He composed with great beauty both in prose and verse he pleaded at the bar and was one of the best orators of his time Nor were his moral virtues less than his accomplishments His moderation and clemency appeared by pardoning the injuries which he had received when he was yet but a private man One day meeting a person who had formerly been his most inveterate enemy "My good friend" cried he "you have escaped for I am made emperor" He was affable to his friends and gentle to persons of meaner stations he relieved their wants and visited them in sickness it being his constant maxim that he was an emperor not elected for his own good but for the benefit of mankind  These were his virtues which were contrasted by a strange mixture of vices or to say the truth he wanted strength of mind to preserve his general rectitude of character without deviation  He was scarce settled on the throne when several of the northern barbarians the Alani the Sarma  s and the Dacians began to make devastations o  the empire These hardy nations who now  und the way to conquer by issuing from their fo  ts and then retiring upon the approach of a superior force opposing them began to be truly formidable to Rome Adrian had thoughts of contracting the limits of the empire by giving up some of the most remote and least defensible provinces but in this he was overruled by his friends who wrongly imagined that an extensive frontier would intimidate  an invading enemy But though he complied with their remonstrances he broke down the bridge over the Danube which his predecessor had built sensible that the same passage which was open to him was equally convenient to the incursions of his barbarous neighbours  Having stayed a short time at Rome so as to see that all things were regulated and established for the safety of the public he prepared to visit and take a view of his whole empire It was one of his maxims that an emperor ought to imitate the sun which diffuses warmth and vigour over all parts of the earth He therefore took with him a splendid court and a considerable force and entered the province of Gaul where he numbered all the inhabitants From Gaul he went into Germany from thence to Holland and then passed over into Britain There reforming many abuses and reconciling the natives to the Romans for the better security of the southern parts of the kingdom he built a wall of wood and earth extending from the river Eden in Cumberland to the Tyne in Northumberland to prevent the incursions of the Picts and the other barbarous nations to the north From Britain returning through Gaul he directed his journey to Spain where he was received with great joy as being a native of that country There wintering in the city of Tarragona he called a meeting of the deputies from all the provinces and ordained many things for the benefit of the nation From Spain returning to Rome he continued there for some time in order to prepare for his journey into the east which was hastened by a new invasion of the Parthians His approach compelling the enemy to peace he pursued his travels without molestation Arriving in Asia Minor he turned out of his way to visit the famous city of Athens There making a considerable stay he was initiated into the Eleusinian mysteries which were accounted  the most sacred in the pagan mythology and took upon him the office of archon or chief magistrate of  place In this place also he remitted the severi  y of the Christian persecution at the representation  Granianus the proconsul of Asia who repres  ted the people of that persuasion as no way culp  He was even so far reconciled to them as to think of receiving Christ among the number of the  s After a winter's continuance at Athens he went over into Sicily and visited Aetna and the other curiosities of the place Returning from thence once more to Rome after a short stay he prepared s  ips and crossed over into Africa There he spent much time in regulating abuses and reforming the government in deciding controversies and erecting magnificent buildings Among the rest he ordered Carthage to be rebuilt calling it after his own name Adrianople Again returning to Rome where he stayed but a very little time he travelled a second time into Greece passed over into Asia Minor from thence went into Syria gave laws and instructions to all the neighbouring kings whom he  ited to come and consult with him he then ent  ed Palestine Arabia and Egypt where he caus  Pompey's tomb that had been long neglected  almost covered with sand to be renewed and  tified He also gave orders for the rebuilding  rusalem which was performed with great exp  ion by the assistance of the Jews who now be  to conceive hopes of being restored to their long  kingdom But these expectations only served to  gg  vate their calamities for being incensed at the p  ileges which were granted the pagan worship  s in their new city they fell upon the Romans  Christians that were dispersed throughout Judea  unmercifully put them all to the sword Adrian  at Athens when this dangerous insurrection beg  wherefore sending a powerful body of men under  the command of Julius Severus against them this general obtained many signal though bloody victories over the insurgents The war was concluded in two years by the demolition of above a thousand of their best towns and the destruction of near six hundred thousand men in battle  He then banished all those who remained out of Judea and by a public decree forbade any to come within view of their native soil This insurrection was soon after followed by a dangerous irruption of the barbarous nations to the northward of the empire who entering Media with great fury and passing through Armenia carried their devastations as far as Cappadocia Adrian preferring peace upon any terms to an unprofitable war bought them off by large sums of money so that they returned peaceably into their native wilds to enjoy their plunder and meditate fresh invasions  Having spent thirteen years in travelling through his dominions and reforming the abuses of the empire he at last resolved to return and end all his fati  ues at Rome Nothing could be more grateful to the people than his resolution of coming to reside for the rest of his days among them they received him with the  ude  t demonst  ations of joy an  though he n  w began to grow old and unweildly  e remitted not the least of his former assiduity and application to the  ublic welfare His  usement w  s in conversing with the most  men in every  rt and science frequently b  sting▪ that he thought no kind of knowledge inconsi  e or t  be neglected either in his private o  publi  Adrian was so f  nd of literary fame that  re t  d he wrote his own life and afte  it to his servants to publish under the    t whatever might have been his  at universal reputation he was in no part of his reign remiss in attending the  duties of his exalted station He ordered the knights and senators never to appear in public but in the pr  per habits of their orders He forbade masters to k  ll their slaves as had been before allowed but or  ned that they should be tried by the laws enacted against capital offences A law so just had he done  othing more deserved to have ensured his reputat  n with posterity and to have made him dear to  kind He still further extended the lenity of the  ws to those unhappy men who had been long  ught too mean for justice if a master was found k  led in his h  use he would not allow all his  to be put to the torture as formerly but  ly such as might have perceived or prevented the murder  In such employments he consumed the greatest part of his time but at last finding the duties of his station daily encreasing and his own strength prop  rtionally upon the decline he resolved upon adopting a successor Marcus Antoninus afterwards surnamed the Pious was the person he pitched upon but previously obliged him to adopt two others namely Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus all of whom afterwards succeeded in the empire  While he was thus careful in appointing a succes  his bodily infirmities became so insupportable  vehemently desired some of his attendants  dispatch him Antoninus however would  permit any of his domestics to be guilty  t an impiety but used all the arts in his  to reconcile the emperor to sustain life His  increasing every day he was frequently heard  "How miserable a thing it is to seek  and not to find it" In this deplorable exi  he resolved on going to B  iae where the  of his disease encreasing they affected his  erstanding Continuing for some time in those  lating circumstances he was at last resolved to  observe no regimen often saying that kings died merely by the multitude of their physicians This conduct served to hasten that death he seemed so ardently to desire and it was probably joy upon its approach which dictated the celebrated stanzas which are so well known and in repeating which he expired in the sixtysecond year of his age after a prosperous reign of twentyone years and eleven mon  hs  U C A D  Titus Antoninus his successor was born in the city of Nismes in Gaul His father was a nobleman of an ancient family that had enjoyed the highest honours of the state At the time of his succeeding to the throne he was above fifty years old and had passed through many of the most important offices of the state with great integrity and application His virtues in private life were no way impaired by exaltation as he shewed himself one of the most excellent princes for justice clemency and moderation His morals were so pure that he was usually compared to Numa and was surnamed the Pious both for his tenderness to his predecessor Adrian when dying and his particular attachment to the religion of his country  He was an eminent rewarder of learned men to whom he gave large pensions and great hon  urs d  awing them from all parts of the world Among the rest he sent for Apollonius the famous  ic p  ilosopher to interest his adopted son Marcus Aurelius whom he had previously married to his daughter Apollonius being arrived at Rome the empero  desired his attendance but the other arrogantly answered that it was the scholar's duty to wait upon the master and not the master's upon the scholar To this reply Antoninus only returned with a smile  That it was surprising how Apollonius who made no difficulty of coming from  Greece to Rome should think it so hard to walk from one part of Rome to another  and immediately sent Marcus Aurelius to him While the good emperor was thus employed in making mankind happy in directing their conduct by his own example or reproving their follies with the keenness of rebuke he was seized with a violent sever at Lo  am a pleasurehouse at some distance from Rome where finding himself sensibly decaying he ordere  his friends and principal officers to attend him In t  eir presence he confirmed the adoption of Marcus Aurelius without once naming Lucius Verus who had been joined by Adrian with him in the succession then commanding the golden statue of Fortune which was always in the chamber of the emperor to be removed to that of his successor he op  d in the seventyfifth year of his age after a pr  sperous reign of twenty two years and almost eight months  Marcus Aurelius though left sole successor to the throne  U C A D  took Lucius Venus as his associate and equal in governing the state Aurelius was the son of Annius Verus of an ancient and illustrious family which claimed its original from Numa Lucius Verus was the son of Commodus who had been adopted to Adrian but died before he succeeded to the t  rone Aurelius was as remarkable for his virtues and accomplishments as his partner in the empire was for his ungovernable passions and debauched  The one was an example of the greatest g  ness and wisdom the other of ignorance sloth  xtravagance  two emperors had been scarce settled on the  when the empire seemed attacked on every  from the barbarous nations by which it was sur  ed The Catti invaded Germany and Rhaetia  all with sire and sword but were after  some time repelled by Victorinus The Britains likewise revolted but were re  ressed by Califurnius But the Pa  thians under their king Vologesus made an irruption still more dreadful than either of the former destroying the Roman legions in Armenia then entering Syria and driving out the Roman governor and filling the whole country with terror and confusion In order to stop the progress of this barbarous irruption Verus himself went in person being accompanied by Aurelius part of the way  Verus upon entering Antioch give an indulgence to every appetite without attending to the fatigues of war rioting in excesses unknown even to the voluptuous Greeks leaving all the glory of the field to his lieutenants who were sent to repress the enemy These however sought with great success Statius Priscus took Artazata Martius put Vologesus to flight took Seleucia plundered and burnt Babylon and Ctesiphon and demolished the magnificent palace of the kings of Parthia In a course of four years during which the war continued the Romans entered far into the Parthian country and entirely subdued it but upon their return their army was wasted to less than half its former number by pestilence and famine However this was no impediment to the vanity of Verus who resolved to enjoy the honours of a triumph so hardly earned by others Wherefore having appointed a king over the Armenians and finding the Parthians entirely subdued he assumed the titles of Armonious and P  rthicus and then returned to Rome to partake of  triumph with Aurelius which was accordingly solem  zed wi  h great pomp and splendor  During the course of this expedition which continued  s  me years Aurelius was sedulously intent upon distributing justice and happiness to his subjects at home He first applied himself to the regulation  of public affairs and to the correcting such faults as he found in the laws and policy of the state In this endeavour he shewed a singular respect for the senate often permitting them to determine without appeal so that the commonwealth seemed in a manner once mere revived under his equitable administration Besides such was his application to business that he often employed ten days together up  n the same subject maturely considering it on  sides and seldom departing from the senatehouse  right coming on the assembly was dismissed by the consul But while thus gloriously occupied  was daily mortified with accounts of the enormi  o  his colleague being repeatedly assured of his  ity lewdness and extravagance However  himself ignorant of these excesses he judg  r  i  ge to be the best method of reclaiming him and therefore sent him his daughter Lucilla a wo  of great beauty whom Verus married at An  But even this was found ineffectual Lucilia  disposition very unlike her father and  of c  es  ing her husband's extravagancies  c  ntributed  o in  lame them Yet Au  cilus still  that upon the return of Verus to Rome his  would  him in a  e and that happiness  at length be restored to the state But  also he was disappointed His return  i  f  tal to the empire for his army carried  plague from Parthia and disleminated  into all the provinces through which it    thing could exceed the miserable state of the  rtly after the return of Verus In this  ture was represented an emperor unawed  ple or the calamities surrounding him giv  to unheard of debaucheries A raging pesti  spreading terror and desolation through all  parts of the western world earthquakes famines and inundations such as had never before happened the products of the earth throughout all Italy devoured by locusts all the barbarous nations surrounding the empire the Germans the Sarmatians the Quadi and Marcomanni taking advantage of its various calamities and making their irruptions even into Italy itself The priests doing all they could to put a stop to the miseries of the state by attempting to appease the gods vowing and offering numberless sacrifices celebrating all the sacred rites that had ever been known in Rome and exhibiting the solemnity called Lectisternia seven days together To crown the whole these enthusiasts not satisfied with the impending calamities making new by ascribing the distresses of the state to the impieties of the Christians alone so that a violent persecution was seen reigning in all parts of the empire in which Justin Martyr St Polycarp bishop of Smyrna and an infinite number of others suffered martyrdom  In this scene of universal tumult desolation and distress there was nothing lest but the virtues and the wisdom of one man alone to restore tranquility and bring back happiness to the empire Aurelius began his endeavours by marching against the Marcomanni and Quadi taking Verus with him who reluctantly lest the sensual delights of Rome for the fatigues of a camp They came up with the Marcommanni near the city of Aquileia and after a furious engagement routed their whole army then pursuing them across the Alps overcame them in several contests and at last entirely defeating them returned into Italy without any considerable less  U C A D    As the winter was for advanced Verus was determined upon going from Aquileia to Rome in which journey he was  seized with an apoplexy which put an end to his life being thirtynine years old having reigned in conjunction with Aurelius nine  Aurelius who had hitherto sustained the fatigues of governing not only an empire but his colleague being left to himself began to act with greater diligence and more vigour than ever  After having subdued the Marcommani a barbarous people that had made inroads upon the empire he returned to Rome where he began his usual endeavours to benefit mankind by a farther reformation of the internal policy of the state  But his good endeavours were soon interrupted by a renewal of the former wars In one of the eng  gements of which he is said to have been miracul  ly relieved when his army was perishing with thirst by the prayers of a christian legion which had been levied in his service For at that dreadful p  ture and just as the barbarians were ready to  upon them we are assured there f  ll such a  ver of rain as instantly refreshed the fainting  The soldiers were seen holding their mouths af  their helmets up to Heaven and receiving the water which came so wonderfully to their relief The  clouds also which served for their rescue at the s  e time discharged such a terrible storm of hail  mpanied with thunder against the enemy as  ished and confounded them By this un  o  the Romans recovering strength and con  once more turned upon their pu  and out th  in pieces  are the circumstances of an engagement ac  ledged by pagan a  wild as christi  n writers  with this difference that the  ascribe  to their own the former to the prayers of t  emperor However this be Aurelius seemed  sible of miraculous assistance that be imm    relaxed the persecution against the Christians  and wrote to the senate in favour of their religion  This good emperor having at a time detected one Avidius in a conspiracy against him and generously granting him his pardon some who were near his person took the liberty to blame his conduct telling him that Avidius would not have been so generous had he been conqueror to this the emperor replied in this sublime manner  I never served the g  ds so ill or reigned so irregularly as to fear Avidius could ever be conqueror  He usually called Phil  s  phy his mother in opp  sition to the Court which he considered as his stepmother He  so was frequently heard to s    that the people were happy whose philosoph  's were kin  s or whose kings were philosophers  He in fact was one of the most considerable men then in bring and though he had been born in the meanest station his merits as a  riter as his we  r  main to this day would have in  ed him imm  t  ty  Having  pr  sperity to his subjects and  to mankind  brought him that the  us of the North were  in  and  the empire He once  to expose his aged person  and made speedy pre  the  vent to the senate  to have money out of t  e public  He  spent three whole  by which they  having finished his l  t  res  amidst the  his subjects It was  to open his third campaign that he was  Vi  i  which stopped the progress of  however could  abate his desire of being beneficial to mankind his  for the youth and unpromising disposition of Commodus his son and successor seemed to give him great uneasiness wherefore he addressed his friends and the principal officers that were gathered round his bed telling them that as his son was now going to lose a father he hoped he should find many  ers in them As he was thus speaking he was s  t  d with a weakness which stopped his utterance and which brought him to his end the day following He died in the fiftyninth year of his age having reigned nineteen years and some days and it seemed as if the whole glory and prosperity of the Roman empire died with this greatest of the Roman emperors  CHAP XXIV From Commodus to the transferring the seat of the empire under Constantine from Rome to By  ntium U C A D  THE merits of Aurelius procured Commodus an easy accession to the throne He was acknowledged emperor first by the army then by the senate and p  ple and shortly after by all the provinces  His whole reign is but a tissue of wantonness and  cruelty and injustice rapacity and corruption There i  so strong a simi  itu  e between his  duct and that of Domition that a reader  be apt to imagine he was going ever the same    He went with his associate to taverns and brothels spent the day in feasting and the night in the most  minable luxuries having no less than three hun  ed females and as many males for detestable purposes He committed incest as Caligula did with  all his sisters He sometimes went about the markets in a frolic with small wares as a petty chapman sometimes he imitated a horsecourser and at other times drove his own chariot in a slave's habit while those he chiefly promoted resembled himself being the companions of his pleasures or the ministers of his cruelty  If any person desired to be revenged on an enemy by bargaining with Commodus for a sum of money he was permitted to destroy him in such manner as he thought proper He commanded a person to be cast to the wild beasts for reading the life of Caligula in Suetonius He ordered another to be thrown in a burning furnace for accidentally overheating his bath He would sometimes when he was in a good humour cut off men's noses under a pretence of shaving their beards and yet he was himself so jealous of all mankind that he was obliged to be his own barber  At length upon the feast of Janus resolving to fence naked before the people as a common gladiator three of his friends remonstrated to him upon the indecency of such a behaviour These were Laetius his general Electus his chamberlain and Marcia a concubine of whom he always appeared excessively fond Their advice was attended with no other of act than that of incoming him against them and inciting him to resolve upon their destruction It was his method like that of Domitian to set down the name of all such as he intended to put to death in a roll which he carefully kept by him However at this time happening to lay the roll on his bed while he was bathing in another room it was taken up by a little boy whom he passionately loved The child after playing with it for some time brought it to Marcia who was instantly alarmed at the contents She immediately discovered her terrors to Laetus and Electus who perceiving their dangerous  situation instantly resolved the tyrant's death After some deliberation it was agreed upon to dispatch him by poison but this not succeeding Marcia hastily introduced a young man called Narcissus and prevailed upon him to assist in strangling the tyrant Commodus died in the thirty first year of his age after an impious reign of twelve years and nine months  The secrecy and expedition with which Commodus was assassinated were such that few were at that time  U C A D  acquainted with the real circumstances of his death His body was wrapped up as a bale of useless furniture and carried through the guards most of whom were either drunk or asleep  Previous to the assassination the conspirators had fixed upon a successor Helvius Pertinax whose virtues and courage rendered him worthy of the most exalted station and who had passed through many changes of fortune was fixed upon to succeed him when therefore the conspirators repaired to his house to salute him emperor he considered their arrival as a command from the emperor Commodus for his death Upon Laetus entering his apartment Pertinax without any shew of fear cried out that for many days he had expected to end his life in that manner wondering that the emperor had deferred it to long However he was not a little surprised when informed of the real cause of their visit and being strongly urged to accept of the empire he at last complied with their offer  Bring carried to the camp Pertinax was proclaimed emperor and soon after the citizens and senate consented their joy at the election of their n  w sovereign being scarce equal to that for the death of their tyrant They then pronounced Commodus a parricide an enemy to the gods his country and all mankind and commanded that his corpse should rot upon a dunghill In the mean time they  saluted Pertinax as emperor and Caesar with numerous acclamations and chearfully took the oaths of obedience The provinces soon after followed the example of Rome so that he began his reign with universal satisfaction to the whole empire in the sixtyeight year of his age  Nothing could exceed the justice and wisdom of this monarch's reign the short time it continued But the praetorian soldiers where maners he had attempted to reform having been long corrupted by the indulgence and profusion of their former monarch began to hate him for the parsimony and discipline he had introduced among them They therefore resolved to dethrone him and accordingly in a tumu  tuous manner marched through the streets of Rome entered his palace without opposition where a Tungrian soldier struck him dead with a blow of his lance From the number of his adventures he was called the Tennisball of Fortune and certainly no man eve  experienced such a variety of situations with s  blameless a character He reigned but three months  U C A D  The soldiers having committed this outrage m  e proclamation that they would fell the emp  re to whoever would purchase it at the highe  price In consequence of this pr  c  amati  n two bidders were found namely Sulpi  an  Di  ius The former a consu  ar person prae  ect of the city and soninlaw to the late empe  or Pertinax  latter a consular person likewise a great lawyer and the wealthiest man in the city Su  pici  promises than treasure to bestow The offers of Didius who produced immense sums  f  money prevailed He was received into the camp and the soldiers instantly sw  re t  obey him as emperor  Upon being conducted to the senatehouse he addressed the few senators that were present in a very  laconic speech  Fathers you want an emperor and I am the fittest person you can chuse  The choice of the soldiers was confirmed by the senate and Didius was acknowledged emperor now in the fiftyseventh year of his age  It should seem by this weak monarch's conduct when seated on the throne that he thought the government of an empire rather a pleasure than a toil Instead of attempting to gain the hearts of his subjects he gave himself up to ease and inactivity utterly regardless of the duties of his station He was mild and gentle indeed neither injuring any nor expecting to be injured But that avarice by which he became opulent still followed him in his exaltation so that the very soldiers who elected him soon began to detest him for those qualities so very oppos  e to a military character The people also against whose consent he was chosen were not less his enemies Whenever he issued from his palace they openly poured forth their imprecations against him crying out that he was a thief and had stolen the empire Didius however in the true spirit of a trader patiently bore all their reproach sometimes beckoning to them with smiles to approach him and testifying his regard by every kind of submission  Soon after Severus an African by birth being proclaimed by his army began by promising to reve  ge the death of Pertinax  Didius upon being informed of his approach towards Rome obtained the consent of the senate to  him ambassadors▪ offering to make him a part  in the empire But Severus rejected this offer  ious of his own strength and of the weakness  the proposer The senate soon appeared of the  sentiments and perceiving the timidity and  of their present master abandoned him  Being called together as was formerly practised in the times of the commonwealth by the consuls they unanimously decreed that Didius should be deprived of the empire and that Severus should be proclaimed in his stead They commanded Didius to be slain and sent messengers for this purpose to the palace where they found him disarmed and dispatched him among a few friends that still adhered to his interest  Severus having overcome Niger and Albinus who were his competitors for the empire undertook next the reins of government uniting great vigour with the most refined policy yet his African cunning for he was a native of Africa was considered as a particular defect in him He is celebrated for his wit learning and prudence but equally blamed for perfidy and cruelty In short he seemed equally capable of the greatest acts of virtue and the most bloody severities  Upon his return to Rome he loaded his soldiers with rewards and honours giving them such privileges as strengthened his own power while they destroyed that of the state For the soldiers who had hitherto shewed the strongest inclinations to an abuse of power were now made arbiters of the fate of emperors  Being thus secure of his army he resolved to give way to his natural turn for conquest and to oppose his arms against the Parthians who were then invading the frontiers of the empire Having therefore previously given the government of domestic policy to one Plautian a particular favourite to who  e daughter he married his son Caracalla he set out for the cast and prosecuted the war with his usual expedition and success He forced submission from the king of Armenia destroyed several cities in Arabia  elix landed on the Parthian coasts took  and plundered the famous city of Ctesiphon marched back through Palestine and Egypt and at length returned to Rome in triumph  During this interval Plautian who was left to direct the affairs of Rome began to think of aspiring to the empire himself Upon the emperor's return he employed a tribune of the praetorian cohorts of which he was the commander to assassinate him as likewise his son Caracalla The tribune informed Severus of his favourite's treachery He at first received it as an improbable story and as the artifice of one who envied his favourite's fortune However he was at last persuaded to permit the tribune to conduct Plautian to the emperor's apartments to be a testimony against himself With this intent the tribune went and amused him with a pretended account of his killing the emperor and his son desiring him if he thought fit to see him dead to go with him to the palace As Plautian ardently desired their deaths he readily gave credit to his relation and following the tribune was conducted at midnight into the innermost recesses But what must have been his disappointment when instead of finding the emperor lying dead as he expected he beheld the room lighted up with torches and Severus surrounded by his friends prepared in array to receive him Being asked by the emperor with a stern countenance what had brought him there at that unseasonable time he was at first utterly confounded and not knowing what excuse to make he ingenuously confessed the whole intreating forgiveness for what he h  d intended The emperor seemed inclined to pardon but Caracalla his son who from the  rliest age shewed a disposition to cruelty with his sword ran him through the body  After this he spent a considerable time in visiting some cities in Italy permitting none of his officers  to sell places of trust or dignity and distributing justice with the strictest impartiality He then undertook an expedition into Britain where the Romans were in danger of being destroyed or compelled to fly the province Wherefore after appointing his two sons Caracalla and Geta joint successors in the empire and taking them with him he landed in Britain to the great terror of such as had drawn down his resentment Upon his progress into the country he left his son Geta in the southern part of the province which had continued in obedience and marched with his son Caracalla against the Caledonians In this expedition his army suffered prodigious hardships in pursuing the enemy they were obliged to hew their way through intricate forests to drain extensive marshes and form bridges over rapid rivers so that he lost fifty thousand men by fatigue and sickness However he supported all these inconveniencies with unrelenting bravery and prosecuted his successes with such vigour that he compelled the enemy to beg for peace which they obtained not without the surrender of a considerable part of their country It was there that for its better security he built that famous wall which still goes by his name extending from Solway Frith on the west to the German ocean on the east He did not long survive his successes here but died at York in the sixty sixth year of his age after an active though cruel reign of about eighteen years  U C A D  Caracalla and Geta his sons being acknowledged as emperors by the army began to shew a mutual hatred to each other even before their arriv  d at Rome But this opposition was of no long continuance for Caracalla being resolved to govern alone in  i  usly entered Geta's apartment and followed by ruffians s  w him in his mother's arms  Being thus emperor he went on to mark his course with blood Whatever was done by Domitian or Nero fell short of this monster's barbarities  His tyrannies at length excited the resentment of Macrinus the commander of the forces in Mesopotamia who employed one Martial a man of great strength and a centurion of the guards to dispatch him Accordingly as the emperor was riding out one day near a little city called Carrae he ha  pened to withdraw himself privately upon a natural occasion with only one page to hold his horse This was the opportunity Martial had so long and ardently desired wherefore running to him hastily as if he had been called he stabbed the emperor in the back so that he died immediately Having performed this hardy attempt he then unconcernedly returned to his troop but retiring by insensible degrees he end  voured to secure himself by flight But his companions soon missing him and the page giving information of what had been done he was pursued by the German horse and cut in pieces  During the reign of this execrable tyrant which c  ntinued six years the empire was every day de  ning the soldiers were entirely masters of every  tion and as there were vari  us armies in diffe  t parts so there were as many interests all opposite  n other  The soldiers without an emperor  U C A D  afte  a suspence of two days fixed upon Macrinus who took all possible methods  nceal his being privy to Caracalla's murder The senate confirmed their choice shortly after and  wise that of his son Diadumenus whom he took  a partner in the em  ire Macrinus was fifty  years old when he entered upon the governm  nt of the empire He was of obscure parentage s  e say by birth a Moor who by the mere rotation of office being made first praefect of the praetorian  bands was now by treason and accident called to fill the throne  He was opposed by the intrigues of Mosa and her grandson Heliogabalus and being conquered by some seditious legions of his own army ne  sted to Chalcedon where those who were sent in pursuit overtook and put him to death together with his son Diadumenus after a short reign of one year and two months  U C A D  The senate and citizens of Rome being obliged to submit to the appointment of the army as usual Heliogabalus ascended the throne at the age of fourteen His short life is but a tissue of effeminacy lust and extravagance He married in the small space of four years six wives and divorced them all He was so fond of the sex that he carried his mother with him to the senatehouse and demanded that she should always be present when matters of importance were debated He even went so far as to build a senatehouse for women with suitable orders habits and distinctions of which his mother was made president They met several times all their debates turning upon the fashions of the day and the different formalities to be used at giving and receiving visits To these fellies he added great cruelty and boundless prodigality so that he was heard to say that such dishes as were cheaply obtained were scarce worth eating It is even said he strove to foretel what was to happen by inspecting the entrails of young men sacrificed and that he chose the most beautiful youths throughout Italy to be slain for that horrid purpose  However his soldiers mutinying as was now usual with them they followed him to his palace pursuing him from apartment to apartment till at last he was found concealed in a privy Having dragged him from thence through the streets with  the most bitter invectives and having dispatched him they attempted once more to squeeze his pampered body into a privy but not easily effecting this they threw it into the Tyber with heavy weights that none might afterwards find or give it burial This was the ignominious death of Heliogabalus in the eighteenth year of his age after a detestable reign of four years  To him succeeded Alexander  U C A D  his cousingerman who without opposition being declared emperor the senate with their usual adulation were for conferring new titles upon him but he modestly declined them all To the most rigid justice he added the greatest humanity He loved the good and was a severe reprover of the lewd and infamous His accomplishments were equal to his virtues He was an excellent mathematician geometrician and musician he was equally skilful in painting and sculpture and in p  etry few of his time could equal him In short  were his talents and such the solidity of his ju  gment that though but sixteen years of age he was considered as a wise old man  About the thirteenth year of his reign the Upper Germans and other northern nations began to pour  wn immense swarms of people upon the more  thern parts of the empire They passed the Rhine  the Danube with such fury that all Italy was  wn into the most extreme consternation The e  peror ever ready to expose his person for the  of his people made what levies he could and w  nt in person to stem the torrent which he speedily e  ted It was in the course of his successes against t  e enemy that he was cut off by a mutiny among  own soldiers He died in the twentyninth year of his age after a prosperous reign of thirteen years and nine days  U C A D  The tumults occasioned by the death of Alexander being appeased Maximin who had been the chief promoter of the sedition was chosen emperor This extraordinary man whose character deserves particular attention was born of very obscure parentage being the son of a poor herdsman of Thrace In the beginning he followed his father's humble profession and only exercised his personal courage against the robbers who infested that part of the country in which he lived Soon after his ambition increasing he left his poor employment and enlisted in the Roman army where he soon became remarkable for his great strength discipline and courage This gigantic man was no less than eight feet and an half high he had a body and strength corresponding to his size being not less remarkable for the magnitude than the symmetry of his person His wife's bracelet usually served him for a thumb ring and his strength was so great that he was able to draw a carriage which two oxen could not move He could strike out a horse's teeth with a blow of his fist and break its thigh with a kick His diet was as extraordinary as the rest of his endowments he generally eat forty pounds weight of flesh every day and drank six gallons of wine without committing any debauch in either With a frame so athletic he was possessed of a mind undaunted in danger and neither fearing nor regarding any man The first time he was made known was to the emperor Severus who was then celebrating games on the birth day of his son Geta He overcame sixteen in running one after the other he then kept up with the emperor on horseback and having fatigued him in the course he was opposed to seven of the most active soldiers and overcame them with the greatest ease From that time he was particularly noticed and taken into the emperor's body guard and by  the usual gradations of preserment came to be chief commander equally remarkable for his simplicity discipline and virtue and upon coming to the empire he was found to be one of the greatest monsters of cruelty that ever disgraced power and fearful of nothing himself he seemed to sport with the terrors of all mankind  However his cruelties did not retard his military operations which were carried on with a spirit becoming a better monarch He overthrew the Germans in several battles wasted all their country with fire and sword for four hundred miles together and set a resolution of subduing all the northern nations as far as the ocean In these expeditions in order to attach the soldiers more firmly to him he encreased their pay and in every duty of the camp he himself took as much pains as the meanest centinel in his army shewing incredible courage and assiduity In every engagement wherever the conflict was hottest Maximin was always seen fighting there in person and destroying all before him for being bred a barbarian he considered it as his duty to combat as a common soldier while he commanded as a general  In the mean time his cruelties had so alienated the minds of his subjects that several conspiracies were secretly aimed against him None of them however succeeded till at last his own soldiers being long harrassed by famine and fatigue and hearing of revolts on every side resolved to terminate their calamities by the tyrant's death His great strength and his being always armed were at first the principal motives to deter any from assassinating him but at length having made his guards accomplices in their design they set upon him while he slept at noon in his tent and slew both him and his son whom he had made his partner in the empire without any opposition Thus died this most remarkable  man after an usurpation of about three years and in the sixty fifth year of his age His assiduity when in humble station and his cruelty when in power serve very well to evince that there are some men whose virtues are fitted for obscurity as there are others who only shew themselves great when placed in an exalted station  U C A D  The tyrant being dead and his body thrown to dogs and birds of prey Pupienus and Balbinus continued for some time emperors without opposition  But differing among themselves the praetorian soldiers who were the enemies of both set upon them in their palace at a time when their guards were amused with seeing the Capitoline games and dragging them from the palace towards the camp slew them both leaving their dead bodies in the streets as a dreadful instance of their sedition  U C A D  In the midst of this sedition as the mutineers were proceeding along they by accident met Gordian the grandson of him wh  was slain in Africa whom they declared emperor on the spot This prince was but sixteen years old when he began his reign but his virtues seemed to compensate for his want of experience His principal aims were to unite the opposing members of the government and to reconcile the soldiers and citizens to each other  The army however began as usual to murmur and their complaints were artfully fomented by Philip an Arabian who was praetorian praefect Things thus proceeding from bad to worse Philip was at first made equal in the command of the empire shortly after he was invested with the sole power and at length finding himself capable of perpetrating his long meditated cruelty Gordian was by his order slain in the twentysecond year of his age after a successful reign of near six years  Philip having thus murdered his benefactor  U C A D  was so fortunate as to be immediately acknowledged emperor by the army Upon his exaltation he associated his son a boy of six years of age as his partner in the empire and in order to secure his power at home made peace with the Persians and marched his army towards Rome However the army revolting in favour of Decius his general and setting violently upon him one of the centinels at a blow cut off his head or rather cleaved it asunder separating the under jaw from the upper He died in the fortyfifth year of his age after a reign of about five years Decius being universally acknowledged as his successor  The activity and wisdom of Decius seemed in some measure  UC A D  to stop the hastening decline of the Roman empire The senate seemed to think so highly of his merits that they voted him not inferior to Trajan and indeed he seemed in every instance to consult their dignity in particular and the welfare of all the inferior ranks of people  But no virtues could now prevent the approaching downfall of the state the obstinate disputes between the Pagans and the Christians within the empire and the unceasing irruptions of barbarous nations from without enfeebled it beyond the power of remedy He was killed in an ambuscade of the enemy in the fiftieth year of his age after a short reign of two years and six months  Gallus  UC A D  who had betrayed the Roman army had address enough to get himself declared emperor by that part of it which survived the defeat he was fortyfive years old when he began to reign and was descended from an honourable family in Rome He was the first who bought a dishonourable peace from the enemies of  the state agreeing to pay a considerable annual tribute to the Goths whom it was his duty to repress  He was regardless of every national calamity and lost to debauch and sensuality The pagans were allowed a power of persecuting the Christians through all parts of the state These calamities were succeeded by a pestilence from Heaven that seemed to have in general spread over every part of the earth and which continued raging for several years in an unheard of manner and all these by a civil war which followed shortly after between Gallus and his general Aemilianus who having gained a victory over the Goths was proclaimed emperor by his conquering army Gallus hearing this soon roused from the intoxications of pleasure and prepared to oppose his dangerous rival he with his son were slain by Aemilianus in a battle fought in Mesia His death was merited and his vices were such as to deserve the detestation of posterity He died in the fortyseventh year of his age after an unhappy reign of two years and four months in which the empire suffered inexpressible calamities  UC A D  The senate refused to acknowledge the claims of Aemilianus and an army that was stationed near the Alps chose Valerian their own commander to succeed to the throne who set about reforming the state with a spirit that seemed to mark a good mind and unabated vigour But reformation was then grown almost impracticable The Persians under their king Sapor invaded Syria and coming into Mesopotamia took the unfortunate Valerian prisoner as he was making preparations to oppose them Nothing can exceed the indignities as well as the cruelties which were practised upon this unhappy monarch thus fallen into the hands of his enemies Sapor we are told always used him as a footstool for mounting his horse he added the bitterness of ridicule to his insults  and usually observed that an attitude like that to which Valerian was reduced was the best statue that could be erected in honour of his victory This horrid life of insult and sufferance continued for seven years and was at length terminated by the cruel Persian's commanding his prisoner's eyes to be plucked out and afterwards causing him to be flead alive  Valerian being taken prisoner as hath been just mentioned Galienus his son  UC A D  promising to revenge the insult was chosen emperor being then about fortyone years old However he soon discovered that he sought rather the splendors than the toils of empire for after having overthrown Ingenuus a commander in Pannonia who had assumed the title of emperor he sate down as if fatigued with conquest and gave himself up to ease and luxury  It was at this time that no less than thirty pretenders were seen contending with each other for the dominion of the state and adding the calamities of civil war to the rest of the misfortunes of this devoted empire These are generally known in history by the name of the Thirty Tyrants  In this general calamity Galienus though at first seemingly insensible was at length obliged for his own private security to take the field and led an army to besiege the city of Milan which had been taken by one of the thirty usurping tyrants It was there he was slain by his own soldiers Martian one of his generals having conspired against him  Plavius Claudius being nominated to succeed  UC A D  he was joyfully accepted by all orders of the state and his title confirmed by the senate and the people We are not sufficiently assured of this emperor's lineage and country Some affirm that he was born in Dalmatia  and descended from an ancient family there others assert that he was a Trojan and others still that he was son to the emperor Gordian But whatever might have been his descent his merits were by no means doubtful He was a man of great valour and conduct having performed the most excellent services against the Goths who had long continued to make their irruptions into the empire but on his march against that barbarous people as he approached near the city Sirmium in Pannonia he was seized with a pestilential fever of which he died in a few days to the great regret of his subjects and the irreparable less of the Roman empire  UC A D  Upon the death of Claudius Aurelian was universally acknowledged by all the states of the empire and assumed the command with a greater share of power than his predecessors had enjoyed for some time before This active monarch was born of mean and obscure parentage in Dacia and was about fiftyfive years old at the time of his coming to the throne He had spent the early part of his life in the army and had risen through all the gradations of military duty He was of unshaken courage and amazing strength he in one single engagement killed forty of the enemy with his own hand and above nine hundred at several different times In short his valour and expedition were such that he was compared to Julius Caesar and in fact only wanted mildness and clemency to be every way his equal  Among the number of those who were compelled to submit to his power we may reckon the famous Zenobia queen of Palmy  a He subdued her country destroyed her city and took her prisoner Longinus the celebrated critic who was secretary to the queen was by Aurdian's order put to death Zenobid was reserved to grace his triumph and atte  nds allutted such hands and such an income  as served to maintain her in almost her former splendor  His severities at last were the cause of his destruction Menestheus his principal secretary having been threatened by him for some fault which he had committed formed a conspiracy against him and as the emperor passed with a small guard from Uraclea in Thrace towards Byzantium the conspirators set upon him at once and slew him with very small resistance He was slain in the sixtieth or as some say the sixtythird year of his age after a very active reign of almost five years  After some time the senate made choice of Tacitus a man of great merit  UC A D  and no way ambitious of the honours that were offered him being at that time seventyfive years old  A reign begun with much moderation and justice only wanted continuance to have made the empire happy but after enjoying the empire about six months he died of a fever in his march to oppose the Persians and Scythians who had invaded the eastern parts of the empire  During this short period the senate seemed to have a large share of authority and the historians of the times are one and all liberal of their praises to such emperors as were thus willing to divide their power  Upon the death of Tacitus the whole army as if by common consent cried out that Probus should be emperor He was forty four years old when he ascended the throne was born of noble parentage at Sirmium in Pannonia and bred up a soldier upon his youth He began early to distinguish himself for his discipline and valour being frequently the first man that in besieging towns scaled the walls or that burst into the enemy's camp He was equally remarkable for single combats and saving  the lives of many eminent citizens Nor were his activity and courage when elected to the empire less apparent than in his private station Every year now produced only new calamities to the empire and fresh irruptions on every side threatened universal desolation perhaps at this time no abilities except those of Probus were capable of opposing such united invasions  However in the end his own mutinous soldiers taking their opportunity as he was marching into Greece set upon and slew him after he had reigned six years and four months with general approbation  UC A D  Carus who was praetorian praefect to the deceased emperor was chosen by the army to succeed him and he to strengthen his authority united his two sons Carinus and Numerian with him in command the former of whom was as much sullied by his vices as the younger was remarkable for his virtues modesty and courage Carus was shortly after his exaltation struck dead by lightning in his tent with many others that were round him  Numerian the youngest son who accompanied his father in this expedition was inconsolable for his death and brought such a disorder upon his eyes with weeping that he was obliged to be carried along with the army shut up in a close litter The peculiarity of his situation after some time excited the ambition of Asper his fatherinlaw who supposed that he could now without any great danger aim at the empire himself He therefore hired a mercenary villain to murder the emperor in his litter and the better to conceal the fact gave out that he was still alive but unable to endure the light The offensiveness however of its smell at length discovered the treachery and excited an universal uproar throughout the whole army In the  midst this tumult Dioclesian one of the most noted commanders of his time was chosen emperor and with his own hand slew Asper having thus as it is said fulfilled a prophecy which had said that Dioclesian should be emperor after he had slain a Boar  Carinus the remaining son did not long survive his father and brother  Dioclesian was a person of mean birth  U C A D  being supposed to be according to some the son of a scrivener and of a slave according to others He received his name from Dioclea the town in which he was born being about forty years old when he was elected to the empire He owed his exaltation entirely to his merit having passed through all the gradations of office with sagacity courage and success  In his time the northern hive as it was called po  red down their swarms of barbarians upon the Roman empire Ever at war with the Romans they issued when the armies that were to repress their invasions were called away and upon their return they as suddenly withdrew into their cold barren and inaccessible retreats which only themselves could endure In this manner the Scythians Goths Sarmatians Alani Carsii and Quadi came down in incredible numbers while every defeat seemed but to encrease their strength and perseverance After gaining many victories over these and in the midst of his triumphs Dioclesian and Maximian his partner in the empire surprised the world by resigning their dignities on the same day and both retiring into private stations In this contented manner Dioclesian lived some time and at last died either by poison or madness but this is uncertain His re  gn which continued twenty years was active and useful and his authority which was tinctured  with severity was well adapted to the depraved state of morals at that time  UC A D  Upon the resignation of the two emperors the two Caesars whom they had before chosen were universally acknowledged as their successors namely Constantius Chlorus who was so called from the paleness of his complexion being virtuous valiant and merciful and Galerius who was brave but brutal incontinent and cruel As there was such a disparity in their tempers they readily agreed upon coming into full power to divide the empire Constantius being appointed to govern the western parts  Constantius died in Britain appointing Constantine his son as his successor Galerius was seized with a very extraordinary disorder in his privities which baffled all the skill of his physicians and carried him off after he had languished in torments for near the space of a year  UC A D  Constantine afterwards surnamed the Great had some competitors at first for the throne Among the rest was Maxentius who was at that time in possession of Rome and a stedfast assertor of paganism It was in Constantine's march against that usurper that we are assured he was converted to Christianity by a very extraordinary appearance One evening as we are told the army being upon it's march towards Rome Constantine was taken up with various considerations upon the fate of sublunary things and the dangers of his approaching expedition sensible of his own incapacity to succeed without divine assistance he employed his meditations upon the opinions that were chiefly agitated among mankind and sent up his ejaculations to Heaven to inspire him with wisdom to chuse the path to pursue It was then as the fun was declining that there suddenly appeared a pillar  of light in the heavens in the fashion of a cross with this inscription    In this overcome  So extraordinary an appearance did not fail to create astonishment both in the emperor and his whole army who considered it as their various dispositions led them to believe▪ Those who were attached to paganism prompted by their auruspices pronounced it to be a most inauspicious omen portending the most unfortunate events but it made a different impression on the emperor's mind who as the account goes was farther encouraged by visions the same night He therefore the day following caused a royal standard to be made like that which he had seen in the heavens and commanded it to be carried before him in his wars as an ensign of victory and celestial protection After this he consulted with several of the principal teachers of Christianity and made a public avowal of that sacred persuasion  Constantine having thus attached his soldiers to his interest who were mostly of the Christian persuasion lost no time in entering Italy with ninety thousand foot and eight thousand horse and soon advanced almost to the very gates of Rome Maxentius advanced from the city with an army of an hundred and seventy thousand foot and eighteen thousand horse The engagement was for some time fierce and bloody till his cavalry being routed victory declared upon the side of his opponent and he himself was drowned in his flight by the breaking down of a bridge as he attempted to cross the Tiber  Constantine in consequence of this victory entering the city disclaimed all praises which the senate and people were ready to offer ascribing his success to a superior power He even caused the cross which he was said to have seen in the heavens to be placed at the right of all his statues with this inscription  That under the influence of that victorious  cross Constantine had delivered the city from the yoke of tyrannical power and had restored the senate and people of Rome to their ancient authority  He afterwards ordained that no criminal should for the future suffer death by the cross which had formerly been the most usual way of punishing slaves convicted of capital offences Edicts were soon after issued declaring that the Christians should be eased from all their grievances and received into places of trust and authority  Things continued in this state for some time Constantine contributing what was in his power to the interest of religion and the revival of learning which had long been upon the decline and was almost wholly extinct in the empire But in the midst of these assiduities the peace of the empire was again disturbed by the preparations of Maximin who governed in the East and who desirous of a full par+ticipation of power marched against Licinius with a very numerous army In consequence of this step after many conflicts a general engagement ensued in which Maximin suffered a total defeat many of his troops were cut to pieces and those that survived submitted to the conqueror Having however escaped the general carnage he once more put himself at the head of another army resolving to try the fortune of the field but his death prevented the design As he died by a very extraordinary kind of madness the Christians of whom he was the declared enemy did not fail to ascribe his end to a judgment from Heaven but this was the age in which false judgments and false miracles made up the bulk of uninstructive history  Constantine and Licinius thus remaining undisputed possessors and partners in the empire▪ all things promised a peaceable continuance of friendship and power However it was soon found that the same ambition that aimed after a part would be content  with nothing less than the whole Pagan writers ascribe the rupture between these two potentates to Constantine while the Christians on the other hand impute it wholly to Licinius Both sides exerted all their power to make opposition and at the head of very formidable armies came to an engagement near Cybalis in Pannonia Constantine previous to the battle in the midst of his Christian bishops begged the assistance of Heaven while Licinius with equal zeal called upon the pagan priests to intercede with the gods in his savour The success was on the side of truth Constantine after an obstinate resistance became victorious took the enemy's camp and after some time compelled Licinius to sue for a truce which was agreed upon But this was of no long continuance for soon after the war breaking out afresh and the rivals coming once more to a general engagement it proved decisive Licinius was entirely defeated and pursued by Constantine into Nicomedia where he surrendered himself up to the victor having first obtained an oath that his life should be spared and that he should be permitted to pass the remainder of his days in retirement This however Constantine shortly after broke for either fearing his designs or finding him actually engaged in fresh conspiracies he commanded him to be put to death together with Martian his general who some time before had been created Caesar  Constantine being thus sole monarch of the empire resolved to establish Christianity on so sure a basis that no new revolutions should shake it He commanded that in all the provinces of the empire the orders of the bishops should be exactly obeyed He called also a general council of these in order to repress the heresies that had already crept into the church particularly that of Arius To this place repaired about three hundred and eighteen bishops  besides a multitude of presbyters and deacons together with the emperor himself who all except about seventeen concurred in condemning the tenets of Arius and this heresiarch with his associates was banished into a remote part of the empire  Having thus restored universal tranquility to the empire he was not able to ward off the calamities of a more domestic nature As the wretched histories of this period are entirely at variance with each other it is not easy to tell the motives which induced him to put his wife Fausta and his son Crispus to death The most plausible account is this Fausta the empress who was a woman of great beauty but of extravagant desires had long though secretly loved Crispus Constantine's son by a former wife She had tried every art to inspire this youth with a mutual passion and finding her more distant efforts ineffectual had even the confidence to make him an open confession of her desires This produced an explanation which was fatal to both Crispus received her addresses with detestation and she to be revenged accused him to the emperor Constantine fired at once with jealousy and rage ordered him to die without an hearing nor did his innocence appear till it was too late for redress The only reparation therefore that remained was the putting Fausta the wicked instrument of his former cruelty to  eath which was accordingly executed upon her together with some others who had been accomplices in her falsehood and treachery  But it is supposed that all the good he did was not equal to recompence the evil the empire sustained by his transferring the seat of it from Rome to Byzantium or Constantinople as it was afterwards called Whatever might have been the reasons which induced him to this undertaking whether it was because he was offended at some affronts he had received at  Rome or that he supposed Constantinople more in the centre of the empire or that he thought the eastern parts more required his presence experience has shewn that they were all weak and groundless The empire had long before been in a most declining state but this in a great measure gave precipitation to its downfall After this it never resumed its former splendor but like a flower transplanted into a foreign clime languished by degrees and at length sunk into nothing  His first design was to build a city which he might make the capital of the world and for this purpose he made choice of a situation at Chalcedon in Asia Minor but we are told that in laying out the ground plan an eagle caught up the line and slew with it over to Byzantium a city which lay upon the opposite side of the Bosphorus Here therefore it was thought expedient to fix the seat of empire and indeed nature seemed to have formed it with all the conveniencies and all the beauties which might induce power to make it the seat of residence It was situated on a plain that rose gently from the water it commanded that streight which unites the Mediterranean with the Euxine sea and was furnished with all the advantages which the most indulgent climate could bestow This city therefore  UC A D  he beautified with the most magnificent edifices he divided it into fourteen regions built a capitol an amphitheatre many churches and other public works and having thus rendered it equal to the magnificence of his idea he dedicated it in a very solemn manner to the God of martyrs and in about two years after repaired thither with his whole court  This removal produced no immediate alteration in the government of the empire the inhabitants of Rome though with reluctance submitted to the change nor was there for two or three years any  disturbance in the state until at length the Goths finding that the Romans had withdrawn all their garrisons along the Danube renewed their inroads and ravaged the country with unheard of cruelty Constantine however soon represt their incursions and so straitened them that near an hundred thousand of their number perished by cold and hunger  Another great error ascribed to him is the dividing the empire among his sons Constantine the emperor's eldest son commanded in Gaul and the western provinces Constantius his second governed Afric and Illyricum and Constans the youngest ruled in Italy This division of the empire still farther contributed to its downfa  l for the united strength of the state bring no longer brought to repress invasion the barbarians sought with superior numbers and conquered at last though often defeated Constantine was above sixty years old and had reigned above thirty when he  his health began to decline His disorder which  an a  e  encreasing he went to Nicome  i  ▪ wh  e finding himself without hopes of a recovery he caused himself to be baptized and having soon afte  eceived the sacrament he expired after a memorable and active reign of almost thirtytwo years  CHAP XXV Of the destruction of the ROMAN EMPIRE after the death of Constantine and the events which hastened its catastrophe  FROM from this dreary period the recovery of the empire was become desperate no wisdom could obviate its decadence no  oppose the evils  that surrounded it on every side Were we to enter into a detail concerning the characters of the princes of those times it should be rather of the conquerors not the conquered of those Gothic chiefs who led a more virtuous and more courageous people to the conquest of nations corrupted by vice and enervated by luxury  These barbarians were at first unknown to the Romans and for some time after had been only incommodious to them But they we now become formidable and arose in such numbers that the earth seemed to produce a new race of mankind to complete the empire's destruction They had been increasing in their hideous deserts amidst regions frightful with eternal snows and had long only waited the opportunity of coming down into a more favourable climate Against such an enemy no courage could avail nor abilities be successful a victory only cut off numbers without an habitation and a name soon to be succeeded by others equally desperate and obscure  The emperors who had to contend with this people were most of them furnished neither with courage nor conduct to oppose Their residence in Asia seemed to enervate their manners and produced a desire in them to be adored like the monarchs of the East Sunk in softness they shewed themselves with less frequency to the soldiers they became more indolent fonder of domestic pleasures and more abstracted from the empire Constantius who reigned thirtyeight years was weak timid and unsuccessful governed by his eunuchs and his wives and unfit to prop the falling empire Julian his successor surnamed the Apostate upon account of his relapsing into paganism was notwithstanding a very good and a very valiant prince He by his wisdom conduct and oeconomy  chased the barbarians that had taken fifty towns upon the Rhine out of their new settlements and his name was a terror to them during his reign which lasted but two years Jovian and Valentinian had virtue and strength sufficient to preserve the empire from immediately falling under its enemies No prince saw the necessity of restoring the ancient plan of the empire more than Valentinian the former emperors had drained away all the frontier garrisons merely to strengthen their own power at home but his whole life was employed in fortifying the banks of the Rhine making levies raising castles placing troops in proper stations and furnishing them with subsistence for their support but an event that no human prudence could foresee brought up a new enemy to assist in the universal destruction  That tract of land which lies between the Palus Maeotis the mountains of Caucasus and the Caspian sea was inhabited by a numerous savage people that went by the name of the Huns and Allanes Their soil was fertile and the inhabitants fond of robbery and plunder As they imagined it impracticable to cross the Palus Maeotis they were altogether unacquainted with the Romans so that they remained confined within the limits their ignorance had assigned them while other nations plundered with security It has been the opinion of some that the slime which was rolled down by the current of the Tanais had by degrees formed a kind of it crustation on the surface of the Cimmaerian Bosphorus over which these people are supposed to have passed Others relate that two young Sevthians being in full pursuit of an heifer the terrified creature swam over an arm of the sea and the youths immediately following her found themselves in a new world upon the opposite  shore Upon their return they did not fail to relate the wonders of the strange lands and countries which they had discovered Upon their information an innumerable body of Huns passed those streights and meeting first with the Goths made that people sly before them The Goths in consternation presented themselves on the banks of the Danube and with a suppliant air entreated the Romans to allow them a place of refuge This they easily obtained from Valens who assigned them several portions of land in Thrace but left them destitute of all needful supplies Stimulated therefore by hunger and resentment they soon after rose against their protectors and in a dreadful engagement which was fought near Adrianople they destroyed Valens himself and the greatest part of his army  It was in this manner the Roman armies grew weaker so that the emperors finding it difficult at last to raise levies in the provinces were obliged to hire one body of barbarians to oppose another This expedient had its use in circumstances of immediate danger but when that was over the Romans found it was as difficult to rid themselves of their new allies as of their former enemies Thus the empire was not ruined by any particular invasion but sunk gradually under the weight of several attacks made upon it on every side When the barbarians had wasted one province those who succeed  of the first spoilers proceeded on to another Their devastations were at first limited to Thrace My  ia and Pannonia but when these countries were ruined they destroyed Macedonia Thessaly and Greece and from thence they expatiated to Noricum The empire was in this manner continually shrinking and Italy at last became the frontier of its own dominion  The valour and conduct of Theodosius in some measure retarded the destruction that had begun in the time of Valens but upon his death the enemy became irresistible A large body of Goths had been called in to assist the regular forces of the empire under the command of Alaric their king but what was brought in to stop the universal decline proved the most mortal stab to its security This Gothic prince who is represented as brave impetuous and enterprizing perceiving the weakness of the state and how little Arcadius and Honorius the successors of Theodosius were able to secure it being instigated also still farther by the artifices of one Rufinus who had designs upon the throne himself this warlike prince I say putting himself at the head of his barbarous forces declared war against his employers and fought the armies of the empire for some years with various success However in proportion as his troops were cut off he received new supplies from his native forests and at length putting his mighty designs in execution passed the Alps and poured down like a torrent among the fruitful vallies of Italy This charming region had long been the seat of indolence and sensual delight its fields were now turned into gardens of pleasure that only served to enervate the possessors from having once been a nursery of military strength that furnished soldiers for the conquest of mankind The timid inhabitants therefore beheld with terror a dreadful enemy ravaging in the midst of their country while their wretched emperor Honorious who was then in Ravenna still only seemed resolved to keep up his dignity and to refuse any accommodation But the inhabitants of Rome felt the calamities of the times with double aggravation This great city that had long sate as mistress of the world now saw herself besieged  by an army of fierce and terrible barbarians and being crowded with inhabitants it was reduced by the extremities of pestilence and famine to a most deplorable situation In this extremity the senate dispatched their ambassadors to Alaric desiring him either to grant them peace upon reasonable terms or to give them leave to fight it with him in the open field To this message however the Gothic monarch only replied with a burst of laughter "that thick grass was easier cut than thin" implying that their troops when cooped up within the narrow compass of the city would be more easily overcome than when drawn out in order of battle When they came to debate about a peace he demanded all their riches and all their slaves When he was asked "what then he would leave them' he sternly replied "their lives" These were hard conditions for such a celebrated city to accept but compelled by the necessity of the times they raised an immense treasure both by taxation and stripping the heathen temples and thus at length bought off their fierce invader But this was but a temporary removal of the calamity for Alaric now finding that he might become master of Rome whenever he thought proper returned with his army a short time after pressed it more closely than he had done before and at last took it  UC A D  but whether by force or stratagem is not agreed among historians Thus that city which for ages had plundered the rest of the world and enriched herself with the spoils of mankind now felt in turn the sad reverse of fortune and suffered all that barbarity could inflict or patience endure The soldiers had free liberty to pillage all places except the Christian churches and in the midst of this horrible desolation so great was the reverence of these barbarians  for our holy religion that the pagan Romans found safety in applying to those of the Chri  ian persuasion for protection This dreadful devastation continued for three days and unspeakable were the precious monuments both of art and learning that sunk under the fury of the conquerors However there were still numberless traces of the city's former greatness so that this capture seemed rather a correction than a total overthrow  But the Gothic conquerors of the West though they had suffered Rome to survive its first capture now found how easy it was to become masters of it upon any other occasion The extent of its walls had in fact made it almost impracticable for the inhabitants to defend them and as it was situated in a plain it might be stormed without much difficulty Besides this no succours were to be expected from without for the number of the people was so extremely diminished that the emperors were obliged to retire to Ravenna a place so fortified by nature that they could be safe without the assistance of an army What Alaric therefore spared Gesneric king of the Vandals not long after contributed to destroy his merciless soldiers for fourteen days together ravaged with implacable fury in the midst of that venerable place Neither private dwellings nor public buildings neither sex nor age nor religion were the least protection against their lust or avarice  The capital of the empire being thus ransacked several times and Italy overrun by barbarous invaders under various denominations from the remotest skirts of Europe the western emperors for some time continued to hold the title without the power of royalty Honorius lived till he saw himself stripped of the greatest part of his dominions  his capital taken by the Goths the Huns seized of Pannonia the Alans Suevi and Vandals established in Spain and the Burgundians settled in Gaul where the Goths also fixed themselves at last After some time the inhabitants of Rome also being abandoned by their princes feebly attempted to take the supreme power into their own hands Armorica and Britain seeing themselves forsaken began to regulate themselves by their own laws Thus the power of the state was entirely broken and those who assumed the title of emperors only encountered certain destruction At length even the very name of emperor of the West expired upon the abdication of Augustulus and Odoacer general of the Heruli assumed the title of king of all Italy Such was the end of this great empire that had conquered mankind with its arms and instructed the world with its wisdom that had risen by temperance and that fell by luxury that had been established by a spirit of patriotism and that sunk into ruin when the empire was become so extensive that a Roman citizen was but an empty name Its final dissolution happened about five hundred and twentytwo years after the battle of Pharsalia an hundred and fortysix after the removal of the imperial seat to Constantinople and four hundred and seventysix after the nativity of our Saviour  FINIS
