 THE PADLOCK A COMIC OPERA As it is perform'd by HIS MAJESTY'S SERVANTS AT THE THEATREROYAL IN DRURYLANE  LONDON Printed for W GRIFFIN at GARRICK's Head in Catharine Street Strand Price s  ADVERTISEMENT  SHOULD any one be curious about the origin of this petty Drama they will find the story on which it is founded among the twelve Exemplary Novels written by the celebrated Author of Don Quixote under the title of The Jealous Husband Some little variation has been necessary in the groundwork in order to render it dramatic but the characters are untouched from the inimitable pencil of the first designer unless the dialogue with which the English writer supplies them has done them an injury The chief addition to the fable is the circumstance of the padlock and the four last lines of the opera sufficiently mark the place from whence that is taken  PERSONS  Don Diego  Mr Bannister  Leander  Mr Vernon  Leonora  Mrs Ar  e  Mungo  M  Di  Ursula  Mrs Dorman  SCENE SALAMANCA  THE PADLOCK  ACT I  SCENE I  A Garden belonging to  DON DEIGO's  House  DON DEIGO  enters musing followed by  URSULA  THOUGHTS to councilLet me see  Humto be or not to be  A husband is the question  A cuckhold must that follow  Say what men will  Wedlock's a pill  Bitter to swallow  And hard of digestion  But fear makes the danger seem double  Say Hymen what mischief can trouble  My peace should I venture to try you  My doors shall be lock'd  My windows be block'd  No male in my house  Not so much as a mouse  Then horns horns I defy you  Deig  Ursula  Urs  Here an't please your worship  Deig  Where is Leonora  Urs  In her chamber Sir  Deig  There is the key of it there the key of the best hall there the key of the door upon the first flight of stairs there the key of the door upon the second this double locks the hatch below and this the door that opens into the entry  Urs  I am acquainted with every ward of them  Deig  You know Ursula when I took Leonora from her father and mother she was to live in the house with me three months at the expiration of which time I entered into a bond of four thousand pistoles either to return her to them spotless with half that sum for a dowry or make her my true and lawful wife  Urs  And I warrant you they came secretly to enquire of me whether they might venture to trust your worship Lord said I I have lived with the gentleman nine years and three quarters come Lammas and never saw any thing uncivil by him in my life nor no more I ever did and to let your worship know if I had you would have mistaken your person for I bless Heaven tho' I'm poor I'm honest and would not live with any man alive that should want to handle me unlawfully  Deig  Ursula I do believe it and you are particularly happy that both your age and your person exempt you from any such temptation But be this as it will Leonora's parents after some little difficulty consented to comply with my proposal and being fully satisfied with their daughter's temper and conduct which I wanted to be acquainted with this day being the expiration of the term I am resolved to fulfil my bond by marrying her tomorrow  Urs  Heaven bless you together  Deig  During the time she has lived with me she has never been a moment out of my sight and now tell me Ursula what you have observed in her  Urs  All meekness and gentleness your worship and yet I warrant you shrewd and sensible egad when she pleases she can be as sharp as a needle  Deig  You have not been able to discover any particular attachments  Urs  Why Sir of late I have observed  Deig  Eh how what  Urs  That she has taken greatly to the young kitten  Deig  O is that all  Urs  Ay by my faith I don't think she is fond of any thing else  Deig  Of me Ursula  Urs  Ay ay of the kitten and your worship and her birds and going to mass I have taken notice of late that she is mighty fond of going to mass as your worship lets her early of a morning  Deig  Well I am now going to her parents to let them know my resolution I will not take her with me because having been used to confinement and it being the life I am determined she shall lead it will be only giving her a bad habit I shall return with the good folks to morrow morning in the mean time Ursula I confide in your attention and take care as you would merit my favour  Urs  I will indeed your worship nay if there is a widow gentlewoman in all Salamanca fitter to look after a young maiden  Deig  Go and send Leonora to me  Urs  I know the world Sir tho' I say't  I'm cautious and wise  And they who surprize  My prudence nodding  Must sit up late  Never fear Sir  Your safety's here Sir  Yes yes  I'll answer for Miss  Let me alone  I warrant my care  Shall weigh to a hair  As much as your own  SCENE II  DON DEIGO  and afterwards  LEONORA  with a Bird on her Finger which she holds in the other Hand by a String  Deig  I dreamt last night that I was going to church with Leonora to be married and that we were met on the road by a drove of oxenoxenI don't like oxen I wish it had been a flock of sheep  Leon  Say little foolish flutt'ring thing  Whither ah whither would you wing  Your airy flight  Stay here and sing  Your mistress to delight  No no no  Sweet Robin you shall not go  Where you wanton could you be  Half so happy as with me  Deig  Leonora  Leon  Here I am  Deig  Look me in the face and listen to me attentively  Leon  There  Deig  I am going this evening to your father and mother and I suppose you are not ignorant of the cause of my journey Are you willing to be my wife  Leon  I am willing to do whatever you and my father and mother please  Deig  But that's not the thing do you like me  Leon  Yes  Deig  What do you sigh for  Leon  I don't know  Deig  When you came hither you were taken from a mean little house ill situated and worse furnished you had no servants and were obliged with your mother to do the work yourself  Leon  Yes but when we had done I could look out at window or go a walking in the fields  Deig  Perhaps you dislike confinement  Leon  No I don't I'm sure  Deig  I say then I took you from that mean habitation and hard labour to a noble building and this fine garden where so far from being a slave you are absolute mistress and instead of wearing a mean stuff gown look at yourself I beseech you the dress you have on is fit for a princess  Leon  Its very fine indeed  Deig  Well Leonora you know in what manner you have been treated since you been my companion ask yourself again now whether you can be content to lead a life with me according to the specimen you have had  Leon  Specimen  Deig  Ay according to the manner I have treated youaccording  Leon  I'll do whatever you please  Deig  Then my dear give me a kiss  Leon  Good b'ye to you  Deig  Here Ursula  By some I am told  That I'm wrinkled and old  But I will not believe what they say  I feel my blood mounting  Like streams in a fountain  That merrily sparkle and play  For love I have will  And ability still  Odsbobs I can scarcely refrain  My diamond my pearl  Well be a good girl  Until I come to you again  SCENE III  LEONORA  HeighoI think I'm sickHe's very good to me to be sure and its my duty to love him because we ought not to be ungrateful but I wish I was not to marry him for all that tho' I am afraid to tell him so Fine feathers they say make fine birds but I am sure they don't make happy ones a sparrow is happier in the fields than a goldfinch in a cage There is something makes me mighty uneasy While he was talking to me I thought I never saw any thing look so ugly in my lifeO dear now why did I forget to ask leave to go to mass tomorrow I suppose because he's abroad Ursula won't take meI wish I had asked leave to go to mass  Was I a shepherd's maid to keep  On yonder plains a flock of sheep  Well pleas'd I'd watch the live long day  My ewes at feed my lambs at play  Or wou'd some bird that pity brings  But for a moment lend its wings  My parents then might rave and scold  My guardian strive my will to hold  Their words are harsh his walls are high  But spite of all away I'd fly  SCENE IV  Changes to a Street in Salamanca  LEANDER  enters with two Scholars all in their University Gowns  Leand  His name is Don Deigo there's his house like another monastery or rather prison his servants are an ancient duenna and a Negro slave    st Schol  And after having lived fifty years a batchelor this old fellow has pick'd up a young thing of sixteen whom he by chance saw in a balcony  Leand  Yes her parents are decay'd gentry that live about a mile or two from Salamanca here and he has made the most ridiculous agreement with them    d Schol  And you are in love with the girl  Leand  To desperation and I believe I am not indifferent to her for finding that her jealous guardian took her to the chapel of a neighbouring convent every morning before it was light I went there in the habit of a pilgrim planting myself as near her as I could I then varied my appearance continuing to do so from time to time till I was convinced she had sufficiently remarked and understood my meaning    st Schol  Well Leander I'll say that for you there is not a more industrious lad in the university of Salamanca when a wench is to be feritted    d Schol  But pr'ythee tell us now how did you get information  Leand  First from report which raised my curiosity and afterwards from the Negro I just now mentioned I observ'd that when the family was gone to bed he often came to air himself at yonder grate you know I am no bad chanter nor a very scurvy minstrel so taking a guittar clapping a black patch on my eye and a swathe upon one of my legs I soon scraped acquaintance with my friend Mungo He adores my songs and sarabands and taking me for a poor cripple often repays me with a share of his allowance which I accept to avoid suspicion    st Schol  And so  Leand  And so Sir he has told me all the secrets of his family and one worth knowing for he informed me last night that his master will this evening take a short journey into the country from whence he proposes not to return till tomorrow leaving his young wife that is to be behind him    d Schol  Zounds let's scale the wall  Leand  Fair and softly I will this instant go and put on my disguise watch for the Don's going out attack my Negro a fresh and try if by his means I cannot come into the house or at least get a sight of my charming angel    st Schol  Angel Is she then so handsome  Leand  It is time for us to withdraw come to my chambers and there you shall know all you can desire  Yes she is fair divinely fair  And softer than the balmy air  That vernal zephyr blows  Her cheeks transcend the rose's bloom  And sweeter is the rich perfume  Her balmy lips disclose  Fly swift O Love and in her ear  Whisper soft her lover's near  Full of doubt and full of fear  If my rashness should offend  Intercede  My pardon plead  Her angry brow unbend  SCENE V  Changes to the Outside of  DON DEIGO  's House

With the precautions I have taken I think I run no risk in quitting my house for a short time Leonora has never shewn the least inclination to deceive me besides my old woman is prudent and faithful she has all the keys and will not part with them from herself but supposesupposeby the rood and Saint Francis I will not leave it in her power to do mischief a woman's not having it in her power to deceive you is the best security for her fidelity and the only one a wise man will confide in fast bind fast find is an excellent proverb I'll e'en lock her up with the rest there is a hasp to the door and I have a padlock within which shall be my guarantee I will wait till the Negro returns with provisions which he is gone to purchase and clapping them all up together make my mind easy by having the key they are under in my pocket  SCENE VI  DON DEIGO MUNGO  with a Hamper of Provisions on his Back which he throws down and sits upon  Mung  Go get you down you damn hamper you carry me

Well as I live he's a pretty young fellow  Leand  You my sweet Ursula have known what it is to be in love and I warrant have had admirers often at your feet your eyes still retain fire enough to tell me that  Urs  They tell you no lie for to be sure when I was a young woman I was greatly sought after nay it was reported that a youth died for love of me one Joseph Perez a taylor by trade of the greyhound make  lank and if my memory fail me not his right shoulder about the breadth of my hand higher than his left but he was upright as an arrow and by all accounts one of the finest workmen at a buttonhole  Leand  But where is Leonora  Urs  Where is she By my troth I have shut her up in her chamber under three bolts and a double lock  Leand  And will you not bring us together  Urs  Who IHow can you ask me such a question Really Sir I take it extremely unkind  Leand  Well but you misapprehend  Urs  I told you just now that if you mentioned that to me again it would make me sick and so it has turn'd me upside down as it were  Leand  Indeed my best friend  Urs  Oh oh hold me or I shall fall Truly Sir you have a great deal to answer for to bring tears into my eyes at this time o'day I'm sure they are the first I have shed since my poor dear husband's death  Leand  Nay don't think of that now  Urs  For you must understand Sir to play a trick upon a grave discreet matronAnd yet after

 The old beldam grows amorous  Urs  Lord love you you're a welllooking young man  Leand  But Leonora  Lea  Ha ha ha but to pretend you were lame I never saw a finer leg in my life  Leand  Leonora  Urs

sing  Till we make a house ring  And tied in his garters old Massa may swing  SCENE III  LEANDER LEONORA URSULA  Leand  Oh charming Leonora how shall I express the rapture of my heart upon this occasion I almost doubt the kindness of that chance which has brought me thus happily to see to speak to you without restraint  Urs  Well but it must not be without restraint it can't be without restraint it can't by my faithnow you are going to make me sick again  Leon  La Ursula I durst to say the gentleman does'nt want to do me any harmDo you Sir I'm sure I would not hurt a hair of his head nor no body's else for the lucre of the whole world  Urs  Come Sir where is your lute You shall see me dance a saraband or if you'd rather have a song or the child and I will move a minuet if you chuse grace before agility  Leand  This fulsome harridan  Leon  I don't know what's come over her Sir I never saw the like of her since I was born  Leand  I wish she was at the devil  Leon  Ursula what's the matter with you  Urs  What's the matter with me Marry come up what's the matter with you Signior Deigo can't show such a shape as that well there is nothing I like better than to see a young fellow with a well made leg  Leand  Pry'thee let us go away from her  Leon  I don't know how to do it Sir  Leand  Nothing more easy I will go with my guittar into the garden 'tis moonlight take an opportunity to follow me there I swear to you beautiful and innocent creature you have nothing to apprehend  Leo  No Sir I am certain of that with a gentleman such as you are and that have taken so much  pains to come after me and I should hold myself very ungrateful if I did not do any thing to oblige you in a civil way  Leand  Then you'll come  Leon  I'll do my best endeavours Sir  Leand  And may I hope that you'll love me  Leon  I don't know as to that I can't say  Leand  Beautiful Leonora I find my being depends upon the blessing of your good opinion do you desire to put an end to my days  Leo  No indeed indeed I don't  Leand  But then  In vain you bid your captive live  While you the means of life deny  Give me your smiles your wishes give  To him who must without you die  Shut from the sun's enliv'ning beam  Bid flow'rs retain their scent and hue  Its source dry'd up bid flow the stream  And me exist depriv'd of you  SCENE IV  LEONORA URSULA  Urs  Let me sit down a little come hither child I am going to give you good advice therefore listen to me for I have more years over my head than you  Leo  Well and what then  Urs  What thenMarry then you must mind what I say to youas I said beforebut I saywhat was I saying  Leon  I'm sure I don't know  Urs  You see the young man that is gone out there he has been telling me that he's dying for love of you can you find in your heart to let him expire  Leon  I'm sure I won't do any thing bad  Urs  Why that's right you learned that from me have I not said to you a thousand times never do any thing bad have not I said it answer me that  Leon  Well and what then  Urs  Very well listen to me your guardian is old and ugly and jealous and yet he may live longer than a better man  Leon  He has been very kind to me for all that Ursula and I ought to strive to please him  Urs  There again have not I said to you a thousand times that he was very kind to you and you ought to strive to please him It would be a hard thing to be preaching from morning till night without any profit  Leon  Well Ursula after all I wish this gentleman had never got into the house Heaven send no ill comes of it  Urs  Ay I say so too heaven send it but I'm cruelly afraid for how shall we get him out again he'll never be able to crawl up the inside of the wall whatever he did the out  Leon  Oh Lord wont he  Urs  No by my conscience won't he and when your guardian comes in if we had fifty necks apiece he'd twist them every one if he finds him here for my part the best I expect is to end my old days in a prison  Leon  You don't say so  Urs  I do indeed and it kills me to think of it but every one has their evil day and this has been mine  Leon  I have promised to go to him into the garden  Urs  Nay you may do any thing now for we are undone though I think if you could persuade him to get up the chimney and stay on the roof of the house till tomorrow night we might then steal the keys from your guardian but I'm afraid you won't be able to persuade him  Leon  I'll go down upon my knees  Urs  Find him out while I step up stairs  Leo  Pray for us dear Ursula  Urs  I will if I possibly can  Leon  Oh me oh me what shall we do  The fault is all along of you  You brought him in why did you so  'Twas not by my desire you know  We have but too much cause to fear  My guardian when he comes to hear  We've had a man with us will kill  Me you and all indeed he will  No penitence will pard'n procure  He'll kill us every soul I'm sure  SCENE V  Enter  DON DEIGO  groping his Way with the Padlock in his Hand  Deig  All dark all quiet gone to bed and fast asleep I warrant them however I am not sorry that I altered my first intention of staying out the whole night and meeting Leonora's father on the road was at any rate a lucky incident I will not disturb them but since I have let myself in with my master key go softly to bed I shall be able to strike a light and then I think I may say my cares are over  Good heavens what a wonderful deal of uneasiness may mortals avoid by a little prudence I doubt not now there are some men who would have gone out in my situation and trusting to the goodness of fortune left their house and their honour in the care of an unexperienced girl or the discretion of a mercenary servant While he is abroad he is tormented with fears and jealousies and when he returns home he probably finds disorder and perhaps shame But what do I doI put a padlock on my door and all is safe  SCENE VI  DON DIEGO MUNGO  from the Cellar with a Flask in one Hand and a Candle in the other  Mun  Tol lol lol

 Go you round softlyyou catch them togeder  Dieg  Confusion distraction I shall run mad  O wherefore this terrible flurry  My spirits are all in a hurry  And above and below  From my top to my toe  Are running about hurry scurry  My heart in my bosom a bumping  Goes thumping  And jumping  And thumping  Is't a spectre I see  Hence vanish ah me  My senses deceive me  Soon reason will leave me

I want nothing wid her  Le  n  Ursula the gentleman says he has some friends waiting for him at the other side of the garden wall that will throw him over a ladder made of ropes which he got up by  Leand  Then must I go  Leon  Yes good Sir yes  Leand  A parting kiss  Leon  No good Sir no  Leand  It must be so  By this and this  Here I could for ever grow  'Tis more than mortal bliss  Leon  Well now good night  Pray ease our fright  You're very bold Sir  Let loose your hold Sir  I think you want to scare me quite  Leand  Oh fortune's spight  Leon  Good night good night  A  Hark the neighb'ring convent's bell  Tolls the vesper hour to tell  The clock now chimes  A thousand times  A thousand times farewell  SCENE THE LAST  DON DIEGO LEONORA LEANDER URSULA MUNGO  Dieg  Stay Sir let

kill me  Dieg  Young man who are you who have thus clandestinely at an unseasonable hour broke into my house Am I to consider you as a robber or how  Leand  As of one whom love has made indiscreet of one whom love taught industry and art to compass his designs I love the beautiful Leonora and she me but farther than what you hear and see neither one nor the other have been culpable  Mung  Hear him hear him  Leand  Don Diego you know my father well Don Alphonso de Luna I am a scholar of this university and am willing to submit to whatever punishment he thro' your means shall inflict but wreak not your vengeance here  Dieg  Thus then my hopes and cares are at once frustrated possess'd of what I thought a jewel I was desirous to keep it for myself I rais'd up the walls of this house to a great height I barr'd up my windows towards the street I put double bolts on my doors I banish'd all that had the shadow of man or male kind and I stood continually centinel over it myself to guard my suspicion from surprize thus secur'd I left my watch for one little moment and in that moment  Leon  Pray pray guardian let me tell you the story and you'll find I am not to blame  Dieg  No child I only am to blame who should have consider'd that sixteen and sixty agree ill together  But tho' I was too old to be wise I am not too old to learn and so I say send for a smith directly beat all the grates from my windows take the locks from my doors let egress and regress be given freely  Leon  And will you be my husband Sir  Deig  No child I will give you to one that will make you a better husband here young man take her if your parents consent tomorrow shall see you join'd in the face of the church and the dowry which I promised her in case of failure on my side of the contract shall now go with her as a marriage portion  Leand  Signior this is so generous  Deig  No thanks perhaps I owe acknowledgments to you but you Ursula have no excuse no passion to plead and your age should have taught you betrer I'll give you five hundred crowns but never let me see you more  Mung  And won't give me noting  Deig  Yes bastinadoes for your drunkenness and infidelity Call in my neighbours and friends Oh man man how short is your foresight how ineffectual your prudence while the very means you use are destructive of your ends  Deig  Go forge me fetters that shall bind  The rage of the tempestuous wind  Sound with a needle full of thread  The depth of ocean's steepy bed  Snap like a twig the oak's tough tree  Quench Etna with a cup of tea  In these manoeuvres shew your skill  Then hold a woman if you will  Urs  Permit me to put in a word  My Master here is quite absurd  That men should rule our sex is meet  But art not force must do the feat  Remember what the fable says  Where the sun's warm and melting rays  Soon bring about what wind and rain  With all their fuss attempt in vain  Mung  And Massa be not angry pray  If Neger man a word should say  Me have a fable pat as she  Which wid dis matter will agree  An owl once took it in his head  Wid some young pretty bird to wed  But when his worship came to woo  He could get none but de cuckoo  Leon  Ye youth select who wish to taste  The joys of wedlock pure and chaste  Ne'er let the mistress and the friend  In abject slave and tyrant end  While each with tender passion burns  Ascend the throne of rule by turns  And place to love to virtue just  Security in mutual trust  Leand  To sum up all you now have heard  Young men and old peruse the bard  A female trusted to your care  His rule is pithy short and clear  Be to her faults a little blind  Be to her virtues very kind  Let all her ways be unconfin'd  And clap your padlock on her mind  END OF THE OPERA
