Marquis  DE GESVRES  and his Lady as indeed so nice and curious a Subject deserv'd I was inclin'd to search our own LawBooks and Historians to see what adjudg'd Cases and Precedents we had of the same Nature  That which is the most considerable in our  English  History was the Case of the Earl of  ESSEX  and the Lady  HOWARD  a Case that engag'd the Politicks of the greatest Statesmen and the Casuistry of a Monarch himself There has as yet been a great Defect of Information concerning this Case which the Reader will now find supplied from an Original  Manuscript  of Archbishop  ABBOT  's written in his own  Hand This  Manuscript  contains an exact Account of all the Artifice and Stratagem used in that Affair and is not only very full and particular upon the Case but lets us into a considerable Part of the Secrets and Politicks of King  JAMES  's Reign I must assure the Publick that it is faithfully printed from the Original which is now in the Hands of a learned Lawyer  To make a Collection of this Nature as perfect as I well could there is added the Lord  AUDLEY  's Tryal and the Proceedings upon the Duke of  Norfolk  's  Bill  of  Divorce  which as they bear some Relation to this Subject so they are now very rare and valuable The Duke of  Norfolk  's Case in particular employ'd some of our greatest Lawyers who have made since very eminent Figures in their Profession and contains all that can be said upon the Article of  Divorce  In short these Volumes complete the Account of Cases of this kind and I dare promise will prove useful and entertaining to the Reader

in the same  _BEing at the Court at  WhiteHall  on the th of  May  or thereabouts his Majesty mov'd me that I would be a Commissioner in a Controversy to be begun between the Earl of  Essex  and his Lady for the separating of them and when his Majesty had ended those few Words with  me my Lord Chamberlain who was then in the Gallery spake also unto me to that Purpose It was unto me a Matter very strange having heard before of some Discontentments between that noble Couple but never imagining that Matters were come to that Head My Answer was alike to both  That I did not know the Ground whereupon they intended to move but that if I were to be a judge in any such Question I would pray that other Bishops being near the Town and Court might be join'd with me  The Persons that were nam'd then were my Lord of  London  my Lord of  Ely  and my Lord of  Litchfield  for at that Time was my Lord of  Bath  with the Queen's Majesty at  Bath  Besides I pray'd both the King's Majesty and my Lord Chamberlain  That before any such Thing were enter'd into I might speak privately with my Lord of  Essex  for the satisfying of mine own Mind  which by both was permitted unto me The Day after I sent for the Earl and having private Speech with him only about the Ability of his Body and nothing else I found him generally much reserv'd in Talk but only avowing the Ability of himself for Generation and that he was resolv'd never to lay any Blemish upon himself that Way I knew not well what to make of this for I did not then understand that some Lords had met before at  WhiteHall  on both Parts the Lord PrivySeal the Lord Chamberlain the Earl of  Southampton  and the Lord  Knowles  as afterwards I heard to settle an Order by Consent how this Prosecution should be that is to say That a Separation should be made and my Lord's Honour every Way preserv'd  Within a Day or two coming to  WhiteHall  I had speech with the Lord Chamberlain in the Gallery going towards St  James  's Park I might not reveal all Particulars of that which pass'd in private but yet I told his Lordship  That I had spoken with the Earl of  Essex  and I perceiv'd it was like to be a Matter of great Difficulty and therefore wish'd his Lordship to be well advis'd before any thing was brought into Publick  I told him  That he must proceed either upon Confession or Proof That it was probable the Earl would not confess his own Impotency for then he blemish'd himself That my Lady's Oath in that Case was not sufficient and how other Proofs might be had I could not conceive That the Earl in open Estimation was to be thought an able Man That his Father was not thought in that Kind unsufficient  The Lord Chamberlain reply'd  That perhaps the Father's Sin was punish'd upon the Son That it was Truth that the Earl had no Ink in his Pen That himself had confess'd that he could not know a Woman and that before divers Noblemen and some of them his own Friends  naming as I remember the Earls of  Northampton  and  Worcester  and the Lord  Knowles All this while I never dream'd of  impotentia versus hanc  but conceiv'd that they would charge the Earl simply with Disability The Lord Chamberlain then seem'd unto me fully resolv'd to procceed and told me whom he would have in the Commission  The Bishops of  London Ely  and  Litchfield  the two Chancellors of the  Exchequer  and  Dutchy  my Judges  for so he call'd them  Sir  Daniel Dun  Sir  John Bennet  Dr  James  and Dr  Edwards I told his Lordship  That I lik'd the Persons very well  The next News I heard was about a Day or two after  That the Commission was out under the Great Seal  which I wonder'd at by Reason that I thought that my Words to the Lord Chamberlain being well weigh'd would have mov'd some longer Consideration Well The Commission is brought it is accepted and Proceeding decreed the Earl of  Essex  is call'd the Libel is put in When we saw it and that it contain'd  impotentia versus hanc  most of us who were not acquainted with the Project before were much amaz'd at it I told the Council for my Lady  That they had laid a very narrow Bridge for themselves to go over  So said my Lord of  London  and divers of the rest only my Lord of  Ely  was still silent My Lord of  Litchfield  two several Times utter'd Speeches as much grieving and repining at this Controversy  That he was Ordinary to the Earl of  Essex  and had been in his House at  Chartely  which he saw to be well govern'd and the Earl did bear himself most religiously therein to his great Comfort That his Wife had the Honour to be Cousin Germain to the Countess of  Suffolk  and therefore he had no Reason but to wish well to the Earl of  Essex  and his Lady both Yet if he had been worthy to be consulted withal he should have thought that seven Years had been little enough to have deliberated whether it were fit to bring such a Business into Question before the World  Another Time he told us  That it was very good that we should proceed with great Wariness in this Cause for  saith he  the World looketh on us what we do and there were not more Eyes upon the Earl's Father losing his Head than there be upon the Earl now losing his Wife  He told me afterwards  That he had ill Will for those Speeches and complain'd that some among us did tell Tales of all that was said and done  And so it appear'd afterwards that Sir  J Caesar  and Sir  Daniel Dun  did Sir  Thomas Parry  in all his Speeches privately murmur'd against this Nullity till he came to  Windsor  where the Day that the King heard us the Lord Chamberlain in my Presence spake privately with him and Sir  Julius Caesar  about this Matter  and from that Time forward Mr Chancellor of the  Dutchy  was alter'd My Lord of  Ely  also for a great while was in Dislike of the Separation as I have credibly heard he open'd himself to Sir  Henry Savile  until such Time as the King spake with him and then his Judgment was reform'd But Truth it is that among us he said nothing  Now the Earl's Answer is taken which appeareth In it there were divers Things very observable He us'd no ill Speech of his Lady for which we all much commended him I gave him so strict a Charge to speak the Truth requiring him as he would answer me before God at the last Day to deliver nothing for Favour or Affection but to inform us in the Verity that it wrung from him something which I suppos'd he intended not to speak so plainly He gave the Reason of his having no Motions to know his Lady carnally and of his thinking that he never should  When I came out of  France  I lov'd her I do not so now neither ever shall I  When he was to answer to the Article that she was  Virgo incorrupta  he smil'd and said  She saith so and she is so for me  Sir  Daniel Dun  catch'd these Words and bid the Register set down then  credit articulum esse verum  These Things gave me no great Encouragement to the Business but yet being at very little  Leisure I let Matters go on and in mine own Part resolv'd nothing Then the Witnesses were depos'd but not publish'd The Inspectresses were chosen who came most unwillingly unto it and howsoever Sir  Julius Caesar  and Sir  Daniel Dun  whom we never suspected to be as Parties in the Cause as afterwards they appear'd to be made all clear and fair Weather yet my Lord of  London  told us openly  That he being with them found that the Ladies knew not well what to make of it that they had no Skill nor knew not what was the Truth but what they said was upon the Credit of the Midwives which were but two and I knew not how tamper'd with  Then came the Lady  Francis  to take her Oath with the seven Compurgators I noted therein some Things A Paper was brought containing  Verbis praecisis  what her Ladyship would swear We saw it and consider'd it and found it too bare and slight to enforce any thing The Commissioners advis'd that it should be more full Dr  Steward  accordingly drew it but he must go forth to the Lady to know whether she would swear it At last it was agreed unto When she came to subscribe it after the Oath taken one or two of her Brothers standing at her Back put her in Mind that she must not write her Name  Francis Essex  which she most willingly remember'd  and subscrib'd  Francis Howard  We saw my Lord of  Litchfield  's Wife to be one of the seven We were afterwards inform'd very credibly That the Lady  Knevet  had declar'd her Sorrow that she was us'd in such an Action and said  That she wept all the Day about it  These Things pleas'd me little that Nobody took Comfort in the Business  Things go on in a Course 'till  MidsummerDay  Then did the King deal with me privately as if he had receiv'd divers Complaints against me The first was  That we delay'd the Proceeding in as much as the Meeting was put off from the    th of  June  'till the    d or    d of  July My Answer was  We had rather gone too fast We had sate Forenoon and Afternoon The Term now grew to an End and we had many Businesses to dispatch of the King's That the CommissionDay for Causes Ecclesiastical was put off for a Week by Reason of  MidsummerDay  falling on a  Thursday  and consequently that our Proceeding in this Cause which commonly attended the other Commission was of Necessity to be defer'd  But my principal Answer was  That we could not shorten it for the Council on both Parts bad agreed upon that Day in  July  and so it was upon the Acts Howsoever therefore the Council for my Lady mov'd openly in Court to abreviate the Time yet the Council for my Lord would not renounce  nor alter their Term probatory but kept them close unto it  Another Objection was  That I acquainted not the King from Time to Time how Matters did go  I answer'd  That I knew not my self for as yet there was no Publication of Witnesses When any thing came to my Knowledge his Majesty should understand it  It was added  That divers Persons repair'd unto me who wish'd not well to the Business Belike  said I  they mean the Earl of  Southampton  who came in the other Day when we were all sitting together But his Coming was about  John Cotton'  s Cause and I never had a Word with him in all my Life touching this Business No  said the King and smil'd  it is Sir  Henry Nevile  Indeed  quoth I  he was with me the other Day and this very Morning But your Majesty well knows what was the Reason It was touching that Cause which your Majesty commanded me to send for him about I deliver'd him your Mind the one Day and he gave me an Answer the other  At this Time his Majesty cast out some Words as if he wish'd well to the Nullity but it was so obscurely that I did not conceive that earnestly he desir'd it After this Day the Complaints were many which were made to the King against me and many Threats were us'd and divers Tricks were play'd to urge me to yield to the Nullity One was  That I should suffer the Earl of  Essex  to go out of Town  I answer'd  He had made his Answer and had his Proctor and it was our Custom then not to stay Men  His Majesty commanded me to enquire if his Presence were not necessary and if it were then I should stay him I sent to Sir  Daniel Dun  to Sir  John Bennet  and to Dr  Steward  and they all agreed that there was no need of his Lordship's being in Town And of this I sent Word to the Lord Chamberlain and my Lord of  Essex  was permitted to depart One while it was given out that I was mov'd by the Queen to cross them when in Truth I had not spoke with her thereabout Another while that I had spoke with the Earl of  Essex  at first and hence his Lordship grew less pliable when they knew what about it was and were told of it before And it was not forgotten that when I gave Charge to the Earl of  Essex  to answer truly to the Positions in the Libel I nam'd the Case of my Lord of  Devonshire  and the Lady  Rich  as if I had compar'd this Cause unto theirs When afterwards the Earl's Council took Exception to the Libel it was given out that they were animated by me to oppose whereas I never spake with them nor knew any thing of their Purpose And ever that was one that there were Delays us'd Yea it was to my Face deliver'd as a Threat that ArchBishop  Grindall  had been overthrown for not giving Consent to  the Divorce of Dr  Julio  as implying that the same would be my Case  About this Time the Lords and the rest of the Feofees were to meet at Mr  Sutton  's Hospital about the Settling of it The Day that we were to come thither my Lord Chamberlain in the PrivyGallery at  WhiteHall  shew'd his Anger towards me that we had not sent for the Keys to his Lordship and that he might deliver over the Cause But when I came to the  Charterhouse  there was deliver'd me a Letter written all with my Lord's own Hand and directed to the Lord ArchBishop the Lord Chancellor and the Lord PrivySeal wherein he did twice take Exception to me by Name and in a Sort brav'd me that so he might pick a Quarrel to me whereunto I reply'd not but bore it with Patience  A little before  Whitsontide  his Lordship was very kind to me and of his own Accord proffer'd me a Chamber at  Greenwich  which my Lord my Predecessor had but after twice Proffering of it and my Accepting of the same his Lordship fell off strangely and I never spake of it more These Complaints and Threats made me to suspect all was not well for what needed these Things to me in a Matter of Justice  The Time now grew on that his Majesty was to go abroad in Progress on a  Sunday  which was the Day before the Council for my Lord were to put in their Answers and Exceptions to the Libel The Lord Privy Seal shew'd me a Letter of the King's to his Lordship wherein he was to expostulate with me for delaying the Business I gave his Lordship Answer what was done and he profess'd that his Lordship was satisfy'd and that no Man could do more than I did On the  Monday  the Council for my Lord put in their Answer which was round and picquant The Lord Chamberlain had Notice of it and complain'd thereof to the King I sent his Majesty the Copy thereof and receiv'd from the King a Letter written all with his Majesty's own Hand shewing Dislike thereof At that Time Sir  William Button  threaten'd Sir  Daniel  's Servant hard for that Answer as the said Sir  Daniel  divers Weeks after told me The Commissioners consider'd of the Answer and disallow'd it giving Order that no Record should remain of it but that it should be utterly defac'd This was very well accepted and now my Lord of  Canterbury  was a very honest Man But 'till this was done their Followers gave out that the King had in two Letters  so school'd the Archbishop as he was never school'd in all his Life  Things now being quiet I call'd Sir  William Button  one CommissionDay unto me and spake thus to him  Sir  William Button  you have follow'd this Business from the first and have been present at the acting of all Things Have you ever seen me in Word or Deed done any Matter that doth not become me  for indeed hitherto I had no Way declar'd my self because we were not come to consider of the Proofs  What is then the Cause that I am thus complain'd upon that I cannot one Day be quiet  His Answer unto me was  That the Lord  Chamberlain  was every way a kind Father to his Children but in this of his Daughter he was so Passionate 'till it had an End that he lay as on a Gridiron broiling 'till the Matter were accomplish'd  Quoth I  It shall not be delay'd by me  Now the Council on both Sides grew on to inform us wherein I noted that whereas the Libel was laid in Nature of  Maleficium versus hanc  my Lady's Council upon the shutting up of the Cause would not apply themselves thereunto neither would they willingly hear of it which seem'd strange since all the Books which they brought particularly to the Cause did mention that and Doctor  Steward  had publickly and expressively said  That it was that  which they did mean  This troubl'd me somewhat because I perceiv'd that they themselves could not tell what to make of it But afterwards fell out another Matter which very much alienated my Judgment from the Cause It appear'd that Sentence could not be given 'till the Time that the King entring his Progress was gone as far as  Windsor  and then his Majesty was soon to depart to  Farnam  Sir  Daniel Dun  told us  That he was to attend the King in Progress that he must be at  Farnam  that he was Old and Lame that it would be too great a Trouble for him to come back again at the Day of Sentence  He therefore pray'd  That we would hear him deliver his Judgment of the whole Matter  This Proffer seem  d wondrous strange to most of us and putting it by handsomely we resolv'd not to trouble him therewith And in this Opinion we arose But afterwards my Lord of  Litchfield  cometh to my Study Door where I and my Lord of  London  were about another Business and telleth us That my Lord of  Ely  and Mr Chancellor of the Exchequer were very desirous to hear Sir  Daniel  speak and that he for his Part was of the Mind that it would do very well and therefore he importun'd us both to give Consent unto it we imagining no great harm could come thereby assented and the next  Day is appointed for that Purpose There Sir  Daniel  cometh with a formal Declaration divided into six Parts to every one of which he spake so largely that with a little replying of ours it spent a whole Afternoon Matters which I most observ'd therein were these He told us  That by our Commission we might hear this Cause summarily  He brought a Book  That he who hath Power to hear a Matter summarily is in Nature of an Arbiter chosen by both Parties and therefore may judge in Discretion as he shall think fit  and more to that Purpose I thought with my self that this was strange Doctrine in a Matter of Marriage that as Arbitrators we might adjudge a Wife to her Husband or not adjudge her according to our Discretion In his discoursing of my Lord's Impotency  Versus hanc  he beat upon the Matter of  Maleficium  and yet by no Means he would have it to be that apparently He insisted much  That the Sentence was to be given in General Terms not naming any particular Impotency  I told him  In such a Sentence the World look that we should yeild a Reason of that which we did  He reply'd  That it was fit to give no Reason And here  said Mr Chancellor of the Exchequer  a Judge is not to give a Reason of his Sentence but only to God I would give no Reason to any Prince in the World  I was once  call'd before Queen  Elizabeth  about a Sentence which I gave and she demanded of me the Reason thereof I told her  A Judge was bound to give no Reason of that which he pronounc'd but only to God  I marvell'd much at these Things and at last reply'd  Well let it be we acquaint not the World with the Reason of that which we do yet is it not fit that I who am the Judge and must pronounce the Sentence know the Ground of that which I am to pronounce  Here after a little pausing one of them said  Yes for you may see that in the Books and Depositions  Quoth I  But I cannot see that there which may satisfy me But Mr Chancellor said I and Sir  Daniel Dun  Commissioners you perhaps be not driven to it yet I shall be forc'd of Necessity to tell Men the Reason of the Sentence For as soon as this Cause is sentenc'd every Man who is discontented with his Wise and every Woman discontented with her Husband which can have any reasonable Pretence will repair to me for such Nullities If I yeild unto them here will be strange Violations of Marriages if I do not I must not tell them that it was fit for my Lord of  Essex  but it is not so for you for the Law knoweth no Persons but is indifferent to all If I then repel them I must shew a Reason Your Case is not like that of my Lord of  Essex  for his Case was thus yours is thus And so must I deliver the  Reason or Men will not be answer'd  In this Time of debating I ask  d Sir  Daniel Dun I pray you Master of the Requests what Examples have we of any Nullity in  England  pronounc'd in this kind Might a Man see any Precedent of it For I would be loath to do a thing that never was done before Yes  saith he  there be Precedents thereof In  Anne  of  Cleve's  Case we have an Example and another in one  Berry  which I have here in my Book  and thereupon out of a NoteBook of his own he read now a Line or two and then two or three other Lines in another Place and so forward My Answer was  I did not think that King  Henry'  s Separation from  Anne  of  Cleve  was for any such Matter but upon a Precontract  I said  King  Henry  the  VIIIth  was a strange Prince in that kind He put himself into many Marriages and when he began that with  Anne  of  Cleve  he fear'd least the Emperor and King of  France  should combine with the Pope against him and therefore he was desirous to strengthen himself with the Protestant Princes in  Germany  and for that he thought this Marriage was much behoveful But afterwards growing into Peace with one or both of those Princes he grew soon weary of the Marriage because he lik'd not the Woman  But then I promis'd to consider further of these two Cases This was the End of that  Day's Labour which when at Night I had recounted with my self I thought it was an audacious Part for such a one as Sir  Daniel  was to teach us out of such poor Grounds both what to do and how to do I found by my Observation that it was a set Match that thus he should be heard that he was prepar'd for the Purpose For no Man upon the sudden or one Day's warning could deliver so much and so digested And now I began to assure my self that he did not shew himself a Judge but was a Stickler for the Nullity I much suspected the Conscience of the Man knowing him reasonably well before both out of mine own Estimation of him and out of the Judgment of my two Predecessors the Lords  Whitgift  and  Bancroft  who held him for a Man most corrupt Yet the next Day I sent unto him for his NoteBook and I caus'd the Record of  Anne  of  Cleve  to be brought unto me Reading over all the latter I found not one Word tending to the present Case  Good Lord thought I how doth this Man deceive me  Perusing his own Book for that of  Berry  I found it to be nothing but the Pleadings of Advocates on both Sides when about the of  Eliz  there was some Question in the Common Law Courts about  Berry  's Land  Berry  himself being dead many  Years before But I saw more in this Book against the Cause now in hand than for it and by some other Writings in my House I discover'd that  Berry  's Divorce  Anno  was for want of his Stones which Dr  Steward  also being now of Council for my Lady and who formerly stood for  Berry  's Brother against the suppos'd Son publickly acknowledg'd These Things made me in my Heart much dislike the Cause and procur'd in me a hard Opinion touching Sir  Daniel Dun  who should not have wrong'd me being my Officer as Dean of the  Arches  Within few Days after the Message cometh to us that we were all to attend the King at  Windsor  This accordingly was done The Morning before the Hearing the Lord Chamberlain in my Presence spoke first earnestly with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and afterward with the Chancellor of the Dutchy who that Day fell from us as appear'd by the few Words that he had before the King Some few Days before that had Sir  John Bennet  by Sir  William Button  and Dr  Edwards  been otherwise dealt withal earnestly to give Consent to the Nullity but that Day we dealt in it more than three Hours His Majesty propounding the Matter ask'd  How Things did stand  Sir  Julius  Caesar  said  That Sir  Daniel Dun  was best able to speak unto it  And then  ex composito  Sir  Daniel  begins and tells a great Tale and especially insisteth upon  Non potnit  When he had done I answer'd him and shew'd the want of Ground for that Conclusion out of other the Earl's evident Answers  That the  Non potuit  was for lack of Love and not for want of Ability  I challeng'd Sir  Daniel  for abusing the King with a false Report and especially for his two Precedents of  Berry  's Case and that of  Anne  of  Cleve  Amongst us was divers ways shew'd the Insufficiency of the Proofs that the Libel was laid short of the Cause and the Proofs were short of the Libel That we had very many Times call'd upon the Council for my Lady that they should look that they rightly laid their Matter and made their Proof strong that in the End they complain'd not of the Judges when the Fault was in themselves Where my Lord of  Litchfield  added  That himself fearing the worst had gone to the  DoctorsCommons  and warn'd the Council for my Lady that they should look to it  Among other Things there utter'd Sir  Daniel Dun  said  What a Disgrace will this be to my Lord Chamberlain and his Daughter if it should not now go forward  My Answer was  They should have look'd to that before they  did begin it We were not the Men that set the Matter on Foot if it were a Disgrace they put it on themselves But  quoth I  must I to save any Man from Disgrace send my Soul unto Hell to give a Sentence whereof I saw no Ground I will never do it  My Lord of  London  Sir  John Bennet  and Dr  Edwards  did carry themselves well that Day altho' Sir  John Bennet  had much Opposition from the King himself When we saw the King earnest I fell down on my Knee and with Tears in mine Eyes I said  I beseech your Majesty if ever I have done you any Service whom I do serve with a faithful Heart or may do you any Service rid me of this Business  I had said before  That I was the unfittest Man that might be to judge of such a Cause I was no marry'd Man I was no Lawyer and I had not had the Time by reason of my infinite Businesses to read so much of that Matter as other Men had  I observ'd that Day many Things in his Majesty's Carriage of the Matter He was Earnest but Gracious and Moderate He found Fault with the Libel and said  That Complaints were made that we went too slow but he perceiv'd we went too fast  He marvell'd that my Lord of  Worcester  and the Lord  Knowles  were not examin'd as Witnesses He constantly profess  d  That he believ'd that my Lord of  Essex  was Impotent for a Woman  He told us  That some of the Earl's Friends had put a Woman to him and he would not touch her  His Majesty said  That the Earl was once purpos'd to have gone to  Poland  to have try'd whither he might be unwitched  To which Things my Reply was  I would to God we might see these Things legally prov'd That his Majesty much dislik'd that Course and therefore he set the Course now in Prosecution and therefore if there were any Error in it he had done the Lord  Chamberlain  wrong and he must take it upon him  In sum I found his Majesty much troubled what to do as I gather'd especially by these Words If my Lord of  Canterbury  and my Lord of  London  have a Negative Voice we must either begin all again and have a new Libel or we must have a new Commission and put other Adjuncts The Conclusion from his Majesty was That we should all meet at  Lambeth  on the Morrow and if we could unanimously consent then go to the Sentence if not we should put it off unto another Day and certify him of it and so farther understand his Pleasure When the King was risen from his Chair he fell to inveighing against these Marryings of young Couples before they be acquainted one with another He told us the Inconvenience of it how he knew in  Scotland  a Father who marry'd his only  Child to a Man against her Will That she withstood it yet her Father forc'd her to marry him That being gone Home with her Husband after a very few Days she came run away from him That her Father jerk'd her and sent her home again That not long after she poyson'd her Husband and was burnt for it while the King was in  Scotland  After his Majesty's going out I follow'd him and told him I evidently perceiv'd that it was in the Earl of  Essex Vitium Animi non Corporis  His Majesty swore he thought so There pass'd some other Speech from the King to me touching his own Lying with the Queen the first Night that he marry'd her But at the last I kiss'd his Hand and departed After I was gone the Lord Chamberlain speaking somewhat against me the King reply'd  The Archbishop hath so adjur'd me to be rid of this Matter that I cannot tell what to say to him  This did Sir  Julius Caesar  tell me that Day at Dinner at  Eaton College  letting me know that the King found no Fault with me But afterward the King coming to Dinner after his Meat had stay'd for him on the Table more than a Quarter of an Hour he sate him down in his Chair and casting his Leg over one Side of it he eat no Meat for a great Space of Time neither said he any Word but sate musing to himself  which every Man observ'd And it was given out by some in the Court that I was gone away in the King's Displeasure Within some few Days after it was also more Ways than one brought credibly to my Ears That the Archbishop and my Lord of  London  should be hereafter kept to their Spiritualities and should meddle no more in temporal Matters And within a while it came so far as that they should have their Temporalities taken from them Sir  John Bennet  was at  Windsor  mov'd by Sir  Thomas Lake  in the Lord  Fenton  's Name and afterwards by the Lord  Fenton  himself That he should alter his Opinion and make his Peace with the King for his Majesty was not well pleas'd with him  As I came Homeward from  Windsor  in my Coach and all that same Night two Things did run much in my Mind the one of them was What a strange and fearful Thing it was That his Majesty should be so far engag'd in that Business That he should profess that himself had set the Matter in that Course of Judgment That the Judges should be dealt withal before and in a Sort directed what they should determine That the like Example had not been seen That his Majesty did win himself much Honour in the Case of  Sutton  's Hospital that notwithstanding all Importunity he had suffer'd the Judges to  do their Conscience This strange moving to the contrary did make me marvelously suspect that it was no direct Matter and as a dutiful Servant to my most gracious Master I wish'd in my Heart that his Majesty's Hand might be taken off the Business The other Point was That we had all this while in our Debatings never or very little meddled with Points of Divinity And I thought with my self that much might be said therein against  maleficium  and the Nullity to be pronounc'd thereupon  versus hanc  for out of this we could never get in all our Talking though they would never cleave fast to it I therefore having formerly revolv'd some such Things in my Mind rose early on the Day that we were to debate Things at large and set down my Mind in writing out of something in Divinity The Copy of this appeareth The Day after we came from  Windsor  being  Tuesday  we met and all the Forenoon we insisted on that which I had briefly written But to deliver my Conscience freely before God I receiv'd no kind or shew of Satisfaction My Lord of  Ely  sate little less than Dumb as if he had never dream'd of any such Matter Divers of the Commissioners wonder'd at him that he who had spent so much Time in reading of the Canonists touching this Question should not think upon Divinity  Briefly up and down by others somewhat was said but nothing to Contentment After Dinner Sir  John Bennet  propounded Reasons out of the Law but without any Satisfaction I observ'd two special Points that Afternoon The one was That we all thought my Lord of  Essex  his Answer to the Libel was neither plain nor sufficient And now it was remember'd that my Lord of  Litchfield  had put to him certain Questions that four Things were necessary to Generation  Membrum virile  Erection Penetration and  Ejaculatio Seminis  which altho' they were then smil'd at and since that Time much Sport had been made at the Court and in  London  about them yet now our marry'd Men on all Hands wish'd that punctually his Lordship might have been held to give his Answer unto them This instructed me that the Proofs were not full A second Thing was that when towards the Evening I wish'd that a Reconciliation might be labour'd between my Lord and my Lady that it should best become us my Lord of  Ely  who from the first Beginning of the Process had been always very silent spake home about that much disliking that any such Thing should now be sought that it was too late that it might be the Cause of poysoning and destroying one of another to bring them together again  Well when we could not agree upon our Conclusion we were inforc'd to put all off unto a longer Day and as the King commanded I was to certify his Majesty of it I wrote a Letter to the King praying humbly that I might be freed from the Trouble of this Cause or at least give no Sentence in it 'till I were a marry'd Man and so might better understand the Business I inclos'd also six Reasons of Sir  John Bennet  's taking Exceptions in Law against the Nullity And withal I joyn'd mine own Reasons in Divinity of which I said in my Letter that I knew not where to seek an Answer to them meaning that the Commissioners had given me none These Reasons afterwards cost me a great deal of Trouble  The next Progress in this Controversy was that I was advertis'd that it was his Majesty's Pleasure that the Cause should be put off until the th of  September  and withal there was brought a new Commission of Adjuncts whereinto my Lords of  Winchester  and  Rochester  were put The Day that I perceiv'd this acquainting the two Chancellors of the Exchequer and Dutchy therewith in the Gallery at  Lambeth  I told them  That I hoped now that for my Part I should be freed from any Trouble therein farther for I did desire to be rid of it  They both answer'd me  That they desir'd in  like sort to be quit of the Matter  A good Business thought I that no Body taketh Comfort of it unless it be Sir  Daniel Dun  of whom I forgot before to note that on the Day of meeting next after our coming from  Windsor  he with a great deal of Insolency challeng'd me for my Speech before his Majesty the Day before  Do not abuse the King Sir  Daniel Dun I remember'd it was in mine own House and if I had rattl'd him according to his Deserts my Lord Chamberlain would have said it had been done for his Sake and in the Progress Sir  Daniel  having the King's Ear would have made Things worse than they were and I therefore forbore him with such Patience that some of the Commissioners told me afterwards that they wonder'd how I could endure those Behaviours at the Hands of a Man of his Quality But yet they commended me for it Now grew I to consider what were the Reasons why these two Commissioners were joined to us and therein I had many Advertisements from divers Friends divers Ways We resolv'd for my Lord of  Winton  that it was suppos'd that there was no great Amity between him and me that when I was Dean there there was some Disagreement between us which they suppos'd yet continu'd That he had an old Grudge to me for having the Archbishoprick which his  Lordship so much desir'd Besides it was some Tickling unto him that his Gravity and Learning should either win in the Archbishop or lay some Blemish upon him if he stood out Certain it is that Sir  William Button  was with him and doubtless would tell him how acceptable this Service would be to his Majesty I heard of good Credit and secretly That he was put in hope to be made a PrivyCounsellor and the Fame was general That for the Father's Labour the Son should be made a Knight It seemeth at the first that he had no great Fancy unto it but being wrought upon he consented so that he might be required by his Majesty to be present This was done by a Letter from  Salisbury  which at his being at  Lambeth  he shew'd me that I should take Notice that he had not come unless he had been commanded I leave him for the Time only signifying that in the Vacation he sent for divers Books from  London  and had Dr  Steward  much with him to inform him in all Particulars Yet I may not forget that while he held off his Consent some hard Opinions were rais'd of him at Court as I found by a Letter from my Lord of  Litchfield  to me For there he was found Fault with that he attended not the King at  Farnham  or at  Andover  And there Blame was laid that Mr  Love  who was  so great with my Lord of  Winton  was like to get the Warden's Place at  Winchester  Dr  Harmar  being reported to be dead Concerning the Bishop of  Rochester  it was well known that he had open'd himself before the King's going in Progress that he lik'd well of the Nullity Coming once or twice while we were about it he with some in my House disputed earnestly for it He was a great Dependant of my Lord of  Litchfield  This was a Way to make him well esteem'd and to arise high in Preferment But in Truth he should not have verify'd the Report which Archbishop  Bancroft  on his DeathBed gave of him together with  Butler  and  Carrier  to the King by a Message unless he did some such Thing When he was put into the Commission he in divers Places seem'd to be much offended that he was made one His Grief was that he was set in Opposition against me He would never give his Voice to it unless I consented These and the like Things he spake as elsewhere so to some of my Servants in my House at  Croydon  For under another Colour he came three Times in the Vacation to me but I never spake a Word with him about that Matter as knowing it would be an Argument against me that I labour'd to draw away the King's Commissioners and the End shew'd that I had no great Reason  to trust him Besides these two Adjuncts the new Commission it self seem'd very strange unto me There were eight made of the  Quorum  and it was so laid that if three of them with two other consented the Sentence might be given so that by the Words thereof if seven had deny'd five might have pronounc'd and prevail'd A Matter so uncooth that as I credibly heard my Lord of  Winton  himself found much Fault therewith Again there was a Clause  Legibus Statutis Ordinationibus Constitutionibus quibuscunque non obstantibus  so resolv'd they were to have it dispatch'd Every thing now stood at a Pause and my Lord of  Ely  who at first deliver'd his Judgment against it to Sir  Henry Savile  as I heard it avow'd upon good Credit but afterwards said he was better instructed by the King began to hearken what Men said of the Matter as appeared by Speech which he had with Sir  John Paiton  to whom notwithstanding he told some Things of the Insufficiency of my Lord of  Essex  The Weather grew fair he hop'd the overflowing of the Isle of  Ely  would cease he would go down in his Visitation he came and took his leave of me but not one Word of the Nullity  Now was his Majesty abroad and I had more Leisure to consider of this Question  I read what I could I confer'd with many Men about divers Circumstances so to inform my self the better I pray'd frequently to God to direct me aright I often perus'd the Depositions but I found little Satisfaction I perceiv'd most of the Lords had a great Dislike of this Proceeding that the better Sort of Men had generally a Detestation of it that the Judges and Lawyers much condemned it I heard many strange Stories of the Lady's Carriage Something was freely spoken of a Woman arraign'd at  Bury  and how to shut that up and so to free the Earl this Course was consented upon  These Things though out of Charity I entertain'd not as absolutely true yet the Concurrence of them from so many made me that I could not contemn them Besides now grew the Rumour strong that a new Husband was readily provided for her Whereof I call'd to Mind the Opinion of Sir  Henry Nevile  deliver'd to me at  Windsor  and I did not forget a Speech of  Overbury  's once to me in that Kind I understood that at  Christmas  last there was a Reconciliation wrought between the Earl and his Lady howsoever it fell out Yea that when the Lords met at  WhiteHall  about the Manner of Separation there was three Times that Day a Likelihood to make them Friends which we  thought imply'd no Disability of my Lord of  Essex  even in their own Opinion I farther understood that whereas it was whisper'd among us the Commissioners That at  Christmas  last my Lord of  Essex  being in Bed with his Lady should labour a quarter of an Hour carnally to know her and in the End should say Frankey  it will not be  and so kiss'd her and bid her good Night That this was not true but that the Earl the Night before his going from  London  at the End of  Trinity  Term said with Tears in his Eyes  That when he went to Bed to her at  Christmas  last he had forgiven all Things as clearly as he wish'd that God should forgive him his Sins but when they were alone she revil'd him and miscall'd him terming him Cow and Coward and Beast  And he added  that she was as bitter a Woman as any was in the World Which Things so cool'd his Courage that he was far from knowing or endeavouring to know her  These Matters together with the small Joy which the Commissioners had to deal in the Business made me have no great Fancy unto it On the other Side I heard that my Lord Chamberlain or his Followers gave out that what was done was perform'd by the King's Direction otherwise it had not been begun and therefore they expected that his Majesty should see it effected that they rested  themselves on him I was much griev'd that they had this Advantage on my Master who being so engag'd as I thought could not well go backward or forward And to increase my Sorrow I was privately advertis'd from Court that his Majesty did mean himself to give an Answer to my Reasons abovemention'd I heard another Way that his Majesty in the Progress wrote much with his own Hands From another Friend I was told That the King with his Answer to the Reasons had written to me a sharp Letter Yea by another I learn'd the Contents of the Letter which was full of Sharpness  These Things in the Summer kept me full of Expectation of some great Discontentment Yet my heart still assur'd me that I was guilty of no Wickedness I found all Persons with whom I spake of my Mind for the Dislike of the Nullity In many Businesses to and from the King by Letters I found nothing but well His Majesty sent me Warrants for three Bucks as formerly he had done and with some Kindness joyn'd  Thus I was tossed in my Thoughts and in all my Troubles I had Recourse to God in Prayer  By this Time the th of  September  draweth nigh and I am inform'd That my Lord of  Winchester  the  Tuesday  before was  come to Town and that besides my Lady's Council Sir  Julius Caesar  and Sir  Daniel Dun  did at St  Mary Overy  's House daily attend his Lordship I expected no great Good of this only from the King I heard nothing but well For some few Days before his Majesty had been at  Whitehall  where I kiss'd his Hand and he did not only look merrily upon me but he gave me Promise of the Bishoprick of  Lincoln  for my Brother as I understood it Some other Matters also pass'd quietly in Speech and I found no Disturbance But on the th of  Septemb  the Day before our new meeting at  Lambeth  my Lord of  Litchfield  being sent from the King bringeth divers Papers unto me seal'd up I open'd them and found there my Reasons first secondly an Answer to them and thirdly a Letter all written with the King's Hand unto me I read them all presently without any abatement whereunto I was help'd by my Foreknowledge that such Things would come I said little unto it only I ask'd my Lord of  Litchfield    Whether he knew what those Papers contain'd  He told me  That the King had read unto him the Answers to the Reasons and had given him the Letter to Seal up in a Paper but in Reverence to his Majesty he held it not his Duty to look into it  Growing afterward in some Speech of our next Days Business I told him plainly  That having spent much Time in this Vacation in perusing the Books I could not find any where but especially in the Answer of my Lord of  Essex  that which would give me Contentment  I read the Places and my Lord confess'd with me  That there was not enough  He told me also  That unless I gave my Consent to the Separation that he would never give his  So much Reverence in him did I find both then and divers Times before against this Divorcement At last he mention'd one Thing which pleas'd me wondrous well and that was That we should call for my Lord of  Essex  again and new examine him upon some Points to be farther declar'd  ad informandum animum Judicis  For hence either we should know so much as might perswade us to decree a Separation or the World might be satisfy'd that we had no Reason for it These Things thus settled his Lordship separateth Then I withdrew my self to my Study and read over again and again the Papers from the King I found them very sharp and perceiv'd by the Time that they arriv'd unto me that they were detain'd 'till that Day that I might be overwhelm'd with them on the sudden and have no Time to deliberate before we were to come the second Time to sit in Judgment These things did much trouble me so that I did sleep but a little that Night I revolved  many things and much tumbling I had in my Miud It griev'd me infinitely that the King should make himself a Party therein That some Unthankfulness and other Matters were little less then Reproaches unto me Methought my faithful Heart to my Master deserv'd no such Sharpness I devis'd how I might give the King Contentment and it was some Comfort to me that we had thought upon a Course of new examining my Lord of  Essex  But as things stood I could not force my Conscience which cry'd upon me  That it was an odious Thing to GOD and Men to give such a Sentence without better warrant  I here cast what might befal to the Church in my Disgrace how  Papists  would scorn at it how it might be my own Ruin and that divers ways a Hazard to my Friends and to the Commissioners which were of my Mind how my Lord of  London  had a Wife and Children which might all be overthrown at one Blow But after Midnight sleeping towards the Morning I consider'd on the other Side That my Conscience was more unto me than all the World that it was a fearful thing in Place of Judgment to give a Sentence against mine own Heart That  Olivarius  the Chancellor of  France  upon such an Occasion grew Mad and dy'd in it That the Manner of our Sentence  must be  Solum Deum prae Oculis babentes a rei veritate inspecta  all which and the like Meditations did much preponderate with me Then I slept again and now rising I found my Heart much settled to persist in that which I held to be Truth I pour'd out earnestly my Prayers to God and was now strongly resolv'd to leave all to God remembring That he had preserv'd me from my Mother's Womb that he had from Time to Time rid me out of all my Troubles that his Power was the same still that he would never forsake me if I turn'd not from him I forgot not  That the Hearts of Kings were in the Hand of the Lord  that I had Experience of the Graciousness both of GOD and the King the Year before when standing earnestly in a good Cause that Prince  Henry  should not marry a  Papist  I receiv'd some sharp Words from the King for my Labour but the next Day his Majesty us'd me very kindly again To this I added That Poverty Imprisonment Death it self were things contemptible to a resolv'd Mind That some of my Predecessors as ArchBishop  Cranmer  and my Lord  Grindal  had given good Examples of these Sufferings and they were recorded in the Catalogue of the Righteous These Thoughts thus revolv'd I read again the Letter from the  King and drawing out into a Paper all the sharp Words I consider'd them again and again and methought they were not altogether so bitter as I apprehended them that they were wrung from his Majesty by my Lord Chamberlain's Importunity that my Master had deserv'd at my Hands that I should bear patiently twenty times more and that all was nothing so the Clearness of my Conscience might be preserv'd With these Resolutions on the  Saturday  I came to  Lambeth  where I met with the News of  Overbury  's Death and the sound of some fearful Apprehensions thereupon bruted about the City I made Trial of my Lord of  London  's Constancy telling him  aut cidendum aut cadendum  I found him most resolv'd avowing unto me  That if he should pronounce for the Dissolution of the Marriage he thought the Devil would that Night fetch away his Soul  Yea he was earnest on me to persist where I began telling me  That the Eyes of the whole Church of  England  were upon me and expected of me that I should shew my self a worthy Man  At last we came to sit where my Lords of  Winchester  and  Worcester  took their Places The Commission was read the Fact and Manner of the Process was open'd and nothing notable done saving that my Lord of  London  proposing that it was fit that my Lord of  Essex  should be call'd to explain himself farther for the fishing out of the Truth all the Commissioners most willing assented thereunto yea my Lords of  Winchester  and  Worcester  expressly saving Sir  Julius Caesar  who softly declar'd his Dislike thereof in my hearing When the Court was risen I spake with my Lord of  Litchfield  and not thinking fit to return any thing to the King in Writing I pray'd him to acquaint his Majesty how Things stood and to tell him that upon this Course of new calling my Lord of  Essex  I hop'd in the End we should give his Majesty Satisfaction The  Sunday  I spent at  Croydon  and preach'd on that Text of Christ's raising the Widow's Son of  Naim  to the great Comfort of mine own Heart That Day I conferr'd with a Friend and settled some Courses if any Trouble should befal unto me I was also by a good Friend inform'd that my Lord of  Essex  on that  Sunday  Morning having five or six Captains and Gentlemen of Worth in his Chamber and Speech being made of his Inability rose out of his Bed and taking up his Shirt did shew to them all so able and extraordinarily sufficient Matter that they all cry'd out Shame of his Lady and said That if the Ladies of the Court knew as much as they knew they would tread her to Death  On the  Monday  we met at  Lambeth  again and Information was given on the Part of my Lady These things pass'd quietly When the Court was risen my Lord of  Litchfield  told me That he had made his Majesty acquainted with our Proposition on  Saturday  but that his Majesty was strongly against it my Lord of  Essex  should any more be call'd and that by no means he would endure it for that peradventure the said Earl either being provok'd by the late Challenge between him and Mr  Henry Howard  or otherwise instigated by the Earl of  Southampton  might speak somewhat which might marr the Business This made me still suspect that all was not right and I reply'd to my Lord  If that be deny'd us and we have no farther Proof I shall never give Sentence for the Nullity As good declare my Mind at first as at last and I pray you so acquaint his Majesty  When I went Homeward I much revolv'd this in my Heart thinking Good Lord What a Case is this Shall any Truth be kept from us Are they afraid to have all out Do they only look to attain their own Ends and care not how our Consciences be intangled and ensnar'd On the  Wednesday  we met again and now Dr  James  is come to us and by and by cometh in my Lord of  Ely  who as it seem'd had meant to have kept him away  but the King sent an express Messenger for him requiring him by a Letter to be there on the  Tuesday  Night Now are we  plena Curia  Before we sate down Sir  Thomas Lake  delivereth a Message unto me from the King That his Majesty desir'd a speedy End of this Business that it had hung long and the World was in expectation of it that the Term grew on which would be full of Businesses That his Majesty on  Monday  was to go to  Windsor  to meet the Queen and my Lord  Chamberlain  with him that therefore he would have us to fall close to our Work not to trouble our selves on the Morrow to come see the King who would come late to  WhiteHall  because some Ceremonies were to be perform'd as upon the last Day of Hunting that we should not attend his Majesty 'till  Friday  but that the Sentence must be given on  Saturday  My Answer was publickly  That there should be no Stay in me and that therefore on the Morrow we would sit Forenoon and Afternoon if the Commissioners so pleas'd and if they thought good Is would not refuse to sit until Midnight  But in mine own Heart I perceiv'd that all the Care was that the Matter might be dispatch'd before the Queen spake with the King whom they suppos'd not to wish well to the Business We go to our Court and Sir  Thomas Lake  stay'd to hear the  Information on my Lord's Part It was strange to see how my Lord of  Winchester  carry'd himself that Day partly to play his Prizes before Sir  Thomas Lake  who might make Report of it to his Fame and partly to shew his Ludimagisterial Disposition He snapp'd up my Lord's Council that they could not speak a Word but he catch'd it before it was out I know what you will say when indeed he knew not neither was it any such Matter as he imagin'd God Almighty will tell you a Tale for that  I tell you Doctor  Bennet  I have as much Law as you I am as good a Lawyer as you are  He fell divers Times on my Lord of  London  Personally and would needs know of him openly  How many times in a Year a Man was bound Carnally to know his Wife  In a Word with Scoffs and imperious Behaviour he play'd the Advocate all that Day to the great Offence of the Standers by so that it was publickly spoke of in  London  which I think came to his Ears so that ever afterward he carry'd himself more tractable I was forc'd to bear it because of avoiding new Complaints  The Point most observable that Day was that both my Lord of  Winchester  and my Lord of  Ely  did deny Maleficiation so that by no Means they would have this Question to proceed in that Nature  which I openly did thank them for and bound it upon before all the Commissioners and Standers by telling them  That the same was my Opinion  But I ask'd my Lord of  Winchester  who sate by me  What be then held it to be  He told me privately  That he held it to be a Natural Impotency which was before the Marriage  I ask'd him  What that might be and whence he gather'd it  He answer'd  I have heard divers Particulars which are enough to perswade me if they be True Yea  my Lord said I  if they be True I have heard as many to the contrary I wish that we might examine whether they be True or no that were fair Proceeding It is my Grief that it is not permitted unto us to try whether all these Matters be so or not This might satisfy a Man's Conscience  So we parted that Night  On the  Thursday  at Ten of the Clock we met in  LambethHall  where my Lady's Council took on them to answer some Scruples objected by Dr  Ferrand  But Dr  Martin  when no Body spake of it fell to wipe away that Objection that my Lord had not sworn  Cum Septima mann  Upon his Speech the Commissioners took hold of it and it then being urg'd strongly my Lady's Council stood at first as if they had been blasted with Lightning Afterward they grew extream angry with Dr  Martin  that he had propos'd it but  the Issue was there could no Answer be given unto it but in the Sight of all the Standers by this was broke off with Shame and Confusion of Faces We din'd not that Day but about one or two of the Clock we withdrew our selves privately into the Parlour I had thought there to have had Dr  Edwards  and the rest who lik'd not of the Nullity to propound their Doubts and so in Order and last of all I would have spoken But there I found a contrary Course resolv'd which my Lord of  Winchester  seem'd much to dislike But my Lord of  Litchfield  Sir  Julius Caesar  and Sir  Daniel Dun  had set the Clock and they must have their Will The six Reasons are produc'd which Sir  John Bennet  had deliver'd the Day after we came from  Windsor  and the Copy whereof was by me sent to the King All these must in their Order be debated One was about the unperfectness of the Libel in which we all receiv'd Satisfaction that the Libel was well to so much purpose as now they declar'd they would have it The other five my Lord of  London  Sir  John Bennet  Dr  James  and Dr  Edwards  maintain'd I allow'd of three of them absolutely▪ and the other two that was Inspection of my Lord's Body and a Time to be assign'd by the Judge to try whether they might Carnally know one another I held to be fit  when those Reasons were propos'd but now such Flames and Quarrels were arisen I thought not amiss now to be forborn My Lord of  Litchfield  with a Pen did note what every Man resolv'd but principally my Words with a Purpose to shew them to the King as I conceiv'd and afterwards I found it to be so I was desirous therefore that his Majesty might see I was not Obstinate but settled to yield to Reason And again I suppos'd that this Candor of mine would make some of them yield to us where they saw there was unevitable Truth But I found it far otherwise for our Afternoon's Work was that they gave shuffling and shifting Answers to the Objections such as themselves had study'd all the Vacation but no Care was whither they were True and Satisfactory or not And to what Sir  Daniel  propos'd all Seven of them consented without sticking or scruple so that I might imagine it was a set Play Upon the first Scruple debating Sir  Julius Caesar  finding the Difference of Opinions and that our Lawyers stuck strongly unto it  Let us  saith he  put it to the Question and let the major Part of Voices determine it  When I saw this to be the Proceeding the Lord thought I deliver me from such Judges But yet observing their Manner I possess'd my Soul in Patience When it grew  to be dark that the King might understand that I was willing to allow time to all that might be said I remember'd Sir  John Bennet  to read the Sentence of the  Rota Romana  where in the Popes own Consistory about the Year a Judgment was revers'd which an Archbishop in  Spain  had given for a Nullity in a Case being ours altogether because after the triennial Cohabitation he had not assign'd a Time for the marry'd Couple to make Trial again and to use Fasting and Prayer This Repeal was read at large and so was another of the  Rota  in the same Kind But both these were slighted as Matters of Nothing and so I think had St  Paul  been if he had been there I urg'd that of  Alexander  III That even in  France  it self no Nullity had been allow'd but that it was  Consuetudo generalis Ecclesiae Gallicanae  and that  Ecclesia Romana  did know or practice no such thing This was slighted like the former and I perceiv'd it was but in vain to speak to them for they were resolv'd and be it Good or be it Bad the Matter should be done  On the  Friday  Morning I went to  WhiteHall  and looking somewhat heavily the King cometh to me and to my Lord Chancellor and offereth us both his Hand to kiss He might perceive by my Countenance that I was not a little troubl'd and  that was perceiv'd by divers of the Lords who privately let me know their Minds that we had a foul and strange Matter in Hand at  Lambeth  At last the King takes me aside and after propounding three or four Businesses walking he took me to the Window and ask'd me  How that great Cause did go forward  I told his Majesty  That I had no Liking of it that I had receiv'd a Letter and Writing from him which very much troubled me for I knew my self to be his dutiful Servant and had not deserv'd Ill of him that it was nothing to me whether she remain'd Wife to the Earl of  Essex  or were marry'd to another Man but that I might not give Sentence where I saw no Proof that I had liv'd fifty one Years almost and had my Conscience uncorrupted in Judgment that I knew not how soon I was to be call'd before God and I was loath against that Time to give a Wound to mine own Soul that all my Grief was that his Majesty's Hand was in it that for other Men I car'd not that I chose rather to die an honest Man than a wise Man that he must never afterward expect true Service of me for how could I be true to him who was false unto God that if he mark'd it well this was no Time to disgrace his good Servants  I told him  That if his Majesty pleas'd to let the Matter alone as he did all other Causes I would make good my Part against all  England  on the Peril of my Head  The  King answer'd  That I would have no Lawyers  I reply'd  Yes enough There is not an honest Lawyer in  England  that would not be on my Side  His Majesty ask'd me  Whether the rest of the Commissioners Yesterday did not perswade me  I told him  No but their Dealing rather drove me the contrary Way For  said I  I came thither ingeniously to yield to any Truth that should be shew'd me but they on the contrary Part in a factious Course went wholly together and what one said another said be it Well or be it Ill without any Scruple  To my Speech  That it was an Example that never had been in  England the King said  Yes  Berry'  s Case  I beseech'd his Majesty  That he would not believe that Cause to be any such Matter for if he would pardon me it should not be long before that I would shew that his Separation was for Lack of his Stones  In this debating the King was very desirous to know what should be the Reasons whereupon I stood that I might have Satisfaction My Answer was  That when I was in Place of Judgment I would not conceal the Reasons of my Sentence but it was to no Purpose to speak them now it would but put his Majesty to a new Trouble to hear them and then some Man must answer them who look'd to his own End and to make a plausible Answer which would not content me without ground of Truth  A great Part of the Time that I had this Speech with the  King my Eyes were full of Tears which I saw much mov'd my gracious Master and especially my earnest Desire  That I might do my Conscience  I perceiv'd the King was much overcome by this my honest Dealing And then whilst his Majesty went to speak with my Lord PrivySeal and my Lord Chamberlain who stood all this while at the farther End of the Gallery and to whom I conceiv'd the King told much of that which I had spoken I went my ways to  Lambeth  to Dinner Now grew I confident to do my Conscience right whatsoever came of it That Day I din'd privately but yet my Lord Bishop of  Bath  was with me whom when I had acquainted with so much of the Cause as I thought fit I receiv'd no Discouragment from him My Heart was much eas'd and now I thought I should no more be troubled Yet between three and four a Clock after Dinner my Lord of  Litchfield  cometh to me from the King and bringeth a written Treatise upon the present Argument which was the Work of a  Scotchman  I know not who I receiv'd it and promis'd that Night to read it as indeed I did riding in my Coach to  Croydon  for thither I thought fit to withdraw my self though it were late for avoiding of more Perturbation This Treatise no way pleas'd me but I thought it the Work of  some hungry Fellow who lack'd twenty Shillings to buy Food to his Belly Here finding it the Day of the End of my Quarter I settled much of my domestick Business I forgot not to commend my self and the whole Cause to God by Prayer I meditated many Things in my Bed In the Morning I rose early and before Day in my Study I set down some Heads what I would speak unto Then went I early to  Lambeth  and there supply'd my brief Notes digesting my Matter of Sentence into Order being resolv'd to speak large and home to the Cause without Touch of any Person more than I must needs By this Time most of the Commissioners were come I sent for my Lord of  London  Sir  John Bennet  Dr  James  and Dr  Edwards  singly and severally into my Study I requir'd them before God not to speak any thing for respect to me but to do that which in their Learning and Conscience they thought to be just and to speak that  intrepid  without Blemish to any Man but soundly to the Matter I found them all avowing that in their Souls they found no Warrant for the Nullity I then wish'd severally Dr  James  and Dr  Edwards  to deliver their Sentence with some Reasons adjoyn'd not many but of the strongest I told Sir  John Bennet  that this Day I expected he should shew himself a  worthy Man that he should deliver his Judgment  per extensum  that they had labour'd to blemish his Skill and to slight his Learning especially therefore both for his Conscience and his Credit he should shew what was in him to maintain an honest Cause If Sir  Daniel Dun  and Sir  Julius Caesar  who came after him should bespatter him in their Choler or lay any Imputation upon him he should find that some of us would take it off him To my Lord of  London  I said  We have three that speak first who I trust will lay such a Foundation in the Heart of the Hearers as shall not be remov'd But the other Side have this Advantage over us they are seven of them Lawyers and Bishops to answer what our three have said and perhaps with weak Men such a Stream of such Persons may much prevail But let not that dismay you my Lord only take this Course Deliver first your own Meditations and then having taken with your Pen some of the Absurdities which in the Sentence some of them will deliver blast those and let the Auditors see that by you the Stream is turn'd Then leave it to me and I doubt not in Almighty God but to batter their Nullity to Dust That tho' they have it by the major part of Voices yet the World shall see what the Cause is and they shall have little Comfort by it I am very well provided I am no way afraid and you shall see I will not be Tonguety'd  So confident  was I in the Honesty of the Cause and in the Helps of Almighty God that I was not now afraid of ten thousands of People but did long to be at the Business as the Lord truely knoweth  When now I was alone revolving my Meditations Sir  J Caesar  cometh into my Study to me telleth me  That he wonder'd that my Lord of  Winchester  was not come that it was even ten a Clock that therefore it was fit that the Hour should be continu'd from ten to twelve  I assented thereto and by some of the Commissioners the Time was prorogu'd Then cometh in Sir  Thomas Lake  with a Message from the King which he must not deliver 'till all the Commissioners were come together So he was forc'd to stay Between Ten and Eleven cometh in my Lord of  Winchester  who as afterwards found had been all the Morning at the Court I told him  We had stay'd for him two Hours and a half  His Lordship slightly excus'd it Then in the Gallery Sir  Thomas Lake  told us  That his Majesty had sent him unto us to deliver two Things  The one was  That in our Sentence we should take heed of gauling of any Person  My Answer was  That from the Beginning of this Process we had ever been wary not to offend in that Kind and that he should be much to Blame who in the Conclusion would transgress that way  And so said the rest The other was  That we should not in any long Manner but compendiously deliver what we had to say  I pray'd Sir  Thomas Lake  to explain that farther whether we were only to say Yea or or No and no more For I would obey the King's Commandment  Tu Regina jube mihi jussa capessere fas est  He answer'd  That he could not say so but that we were to speak briefly Yea  but said Sir  Julius Caesar I know the King's Mind for I was Yesterday with him and he told me that he expected that we should go no farther than Yea or Nay for of Reasons there would be no End Yea  saith he  The King told me he was promis'd so much By whom  said I  I think  quoth he  by your Grace Not so  said I But I said indeed  Let every Man deliver his own Conscience I will not perturb the Sentence No more indeed will I  Then he replyeth  I know the King expecteth we should say no more than I do like this Sentence or I do not like it And that you know Sir  Daniel Dun  is the Manner of the Delegates and not to go farther It is so  saith Sir  Daniel  Upon this the Bishops all said  We were best to proceed in that Fashion  To which I reply'd  I will not be willful but if it be agreed upon and it be the King's Pleasure I will obey But look you to it for if any Man give a Reason I am no more bound than he but that I will return the Reason of my Opinion and Judgment  They all said they would be observant of  it Thus Sir  Thomas Lake  was dismiss'd Then we call'd for the Sentences on both Sides which the Counsel had ready They dislik'd that which was Absolutory of the Earl of  Essex  and we approv'd it We found Fault with the other Sentence Anullatory both for the Whole and because some Parts in it in our Judgment were apparently false But they persisted in their Intention So we went into the Hall where my self my Lord of  London  Sir  John Bennet  Dr  James  and Dr  Edwards  freed my Lord of  Essex  The Bishops of  Winton    Ely    Litchfield  and  Rochester  together with the two Chancellors and Sir  Daniel Dun  pronounc'd for the Nullity and subscrib'd the Sentence my Lord of  Winton  pronouncing it We perceiv'd that they were afraid we should at large speak our Reasons openly being the last who were to speak  The three Bishops of  Winton    Ely  and  Litchfield  went immediately to the Court hoping to receive great Thanks for their Service but they waited a full Hour e'er they could speak with the King however they sped afterward And we were glad that we were freed of the Trouble And now I who would not have given the Sentence for all the Gold in  India  do expect God's Pleasure what will become of this Business hereafter and submit my self  to God's Providence who ever preserveth those that trust in him  THIS Narration is wholly written with mine own Hand and was finish'd the second of  October  being the eighth Day after the giving of the Sentence And I protest before Almighty God that I have not willingly written any Untruth therein but have deliver'd all things fairly to the best of my Understanding helping my self with such Memorials and Notes as I took from Time to Time that if there were occasion I might thus at large set down the Truth to Posterity when this Case shall be rung from  Rome  Gates or the Fact hereafter be question'd  GEORGE Canterbury  Some Observable Things since  Sept  when the Sentence was given in the Cause of the Earl of ESSEX continu'd unto the Day of the Marriage  Decemb    _THE Sentence being given for the Nullity the Minds of Men in their several Places were wonderfully distracted and every one spake according to their Fancies But for the most part there was a Detestation of the Thing and a great Dislike of those that gave the Sentence which was express'd by all Courses that Men durst adventure upon On the other Side there was a strange applauding and commending of those who withstood the Separation and from all Parts a Testimony came unto them That they had done like Honest Men albeit the only Scope which they aim'd at was the Discharge of their Conscience and not vain Popular Applause The Archbishop the Day after the Sentence went to the Court to  WhiteHall  and waited on the King to Chapel  standing also by him in the Closet where he was strangely look'd on by the King as he was also by some of the Lords but nothing being said unto him he took no Notice of it but bore all patiently This Strangeness of the King held on at  HamptonCourt  and elsewhere and it came to the Archbishop's Ear that the King spake divers Times hardly of him but much magnify'd them of the Affirmative Part and especially my Lord of  Winchester  as the worthiest Man in the Kingdom Some things were done also in Recompence to divers of them as Sir  Julius Caesar  's Son was made a Knight my Lord of  Winton  's Son also had the same Reward which some merry Fellow blighted with the Name of Sir  Nullity Hilson  and the Bishop of  Litchfield  must remove to  Lincoln  and as for  Litchfield  it must be bestow'd on Mr Dean of St  Paul  's that so Doctor  Cary  might be preferr'd to the Deanery of  Paul  's for which it was generally suppos'd he should pay well But now it run currant that the Archbishop must no more have to do with Naming any to ChurchLivings but some Lords in Court should dispose of all and principally it must be provided that  Abbot  must never be preferr'd no not so much as to  Litchfield  so far was he from  Lincoln  which was formerly promis'd unto him These things grew detestable to  the People who fear'd that even Religion would smart for it but the Parties most malign'd were silent and patient expecting God's Leisure and Malice enough from some other Men The first thing of Bitterness that appear'd was a Letter from  Royston  under the King's Hand and Signet directed to the Commissioners in the former Sentence but brought to the ArchBishop about three Weeks after the Sentence This was a most sharp Letter complaining that they of the Negative Part for so they were stil'd had hinder'd the Act to be made upon the Sentence had solemnly Protested against that which was done had given unto themselves other Titles than were in the King's Commission had glorify'd themselves in that which was done by which they laid an Imputation upon the King's Conscience who had declar'd himself for the Divorce and other things of the like Nature This Letter being read to the Commissioners the Archbishop said That he knew not what it meant for he understood of no Man that Protested nor knew nothing of any Man's arrogating of Titles to him or glorifying himself And as for the Act he suppos'd it to be made up in common Form and never heard ought to the contrary neither meddled with any thing therein but left it to the Register and what he had done with it he could not  tell Furthermore he ask'd all the Commissioners particularly if they knew what this meant or if any of them were able to charge those of the Negative with the Points quarrelled at who all with one Consent deny'd that they could and expressly averr'd that there was no such thing done at the Time of the Sentence as had been complain'd upon When standing thus in Admiration Sir  Daniel Dun  took upon him to understand the Matter and said that if the Register were call'd it would appear there was something in it  Barker  the Register is sent for and being demanded whether he had made up the Act he said that he had drawn it up in a Form that he lik'd but some other of the Commissioners did dislike it And thereupon he shew'd two Forms the one more large the other more brief but both of them having in it that the Archbishop and the rest of the Negative Party protested against the Sentence Here every Man wonder'd at him out of what Ground he should do this and all the Commissioners with one Consent very much rebuk'd him professing that there was no such Protestation us'd For the rest of the Charge in the King's Letter  Barker  freed all in all things save only Dr  Edwards  who was absent by reason of his sore Eyes The Archbishop upon this desir'd the Commissioners to suspend  their Judgment touching Dr  Edwards  'till he might answer for himself saying that Honour Justice and Charity requir'd so much in his Behalf and adding withal that he doubted not but it would prove some mistaking of the Register's Part to whom it was apparent that small Credit was to be given since he had so grossly set down of them that they Protested when all the Commissioners could witness the contrary Moreover he desir'd Mr Chancellor of the Exchequer and Sir  Daniel Dun  to certify the Lord Chamberlain how free and innocent from those Aspersions the rest were found and that from Top to Toe it was nothing but Misprision Before this Truth was discover'd it was known that a Gentleman of the Earl of  Northampton  's had said to Sir  John Levison  and that as from his Lordship  That there was something descry'd which would break the Archbishop  's  Back  such Account was made of his Business  Thus Things pass'd silently until the next Week when upon the  Thursday  being High Commission Day Dr  Edwards  being amended repair'd to  Lambeth  His coming was watched and then was deliver'd to the Archbishop a second Letter from the King commending the Concurrence of all to the Act to be made up in common Form but requiring the Commissioners  to convene Dr  Edwards  and the Register before them and to charge them with all the foreremember'd Matters and to learn where the Fault did lie It was also commanded that they should require the said Doctor and Register to set down in Writing what had pass'd between them and if it were found that Dr  Edwards  were to blame he should be suspended 'till the King's Pleasure were farther known  These Things are fallen upon and Dr  Edwards  shew'd that the Register had wronged him and that no Part of the Accusation was true  in modo forma  appealing to the Commissioners what Faith might be given to  Barker  contesting against him when it had been manifestly proved that he had forged the Matter of Protestation against my Lord of  Canterbury  my Lord of  London  and the rest Time is assigned to them to deliver in their Writings and accordingly about two Days after Dr  Edwards  bringeth to the Archbishop his Answer denying the Points whereon he was accus'd But  Barker  brought nothing till a Fortnight after and then by Candlelight when the HighCommission was risen and the Commissioners were departed he delivereth a long Writing to the Archbishop who could not read it that Night but reproved him for detaining it so long  On the Morrow my Lord of  Canterbury  perus'd this Declaration as as he found it to be uncertainly and diffidently set down for some other Circumstances so he discovered there one Thing much to be observed and that was that  Barker  delivered That some few Days after the Sentence the Lord Chamberlain sent for him finding Fault that the Act was not made up And there Speech was That some desir'd to have their Titles put in as well as the Titles of others and for that  Barker  named Sir  John Bennet  Whereunto the Lord Chamberlain said  I know no Title that he hath    Yes  said  Barker    he is Judge of the Prerogative Court of  Canterbury But  Barker  concludeth the Narration That himself finding that he had named Sir  John Bennet  unjustly therefore was in mind to excuse him and was about to say that he had done him Wrong but the Lord Chamberlain was so angry that he could not bring it forth but went his Way leaving the Lord in that Opinion  By this it was descry'd that in the first Letter Sir  John Bennet  was aim'd at as well as Dr  Edwards  to put some Disgrace upon him which made Men wonderously marvel at the vindicative Mind of some Men who sought for an Occasion to do other Men Disgrace The End of the Matter was That no Man could be touch'd  and therefore the Archbishop taking Sir  Julius Caesar  with him acquainted the King who was now return'd from  Royston  with the State of the whole Matter informing his Majesty that Fault fell on no Man save the Register and therefore if his Highness were pleased to have him punish'd it might be so But for the Thing itself since the Report was more than there was Cause Mr Chancellor of the  Exchequer  said It was better to let it die and stir in it no farther To this the King assented being not willing that any Punishment should be laid on the Register whereby it appeared that the Intendment was in the stirring of these Coals to have burnt some greater Persons than  Barker  the Register  All this while it was confidently given out That because the Sentence had been oppos'd there should a Book be written in the Defence of it and one while it should be by a Divine and that sometimes was my Lord of  Winton  and sometimes my Lord of  Ely  and it was said they were earnestly about it Another while it should be by a Civilian and then Sir  Daniel Dun  must do it But at other Times it must be by a  Scotchman  who had written somewhat of that Argument before the Sentence and other while two  Scotchmen  must join together about it And to make  the Thing the more probable the Lord  Felton  sent to the Archbishop for the Copy of the  Scotch  man's Writing which was sent unto him and after copying of it out it was return'd to my Lord of  Canterbury  again This Speech of a Book continu'd about nine Weeks in all but at last Dr  Stuart  and Dr  Bird  were sent for to the Lord Chamberlain and their Judgment was ask'd concerning that Point Their Advice was That it should by no means be medled withal but that Things should die of themselves But no Questioning by Writing for so it might go on to the World's End For one Book might breed another and so they whom it concern'd should never be in rest This was resolv'd on and afterwards there was no more Speech of Writing saving only faintingly and whisperingly but nothing to the Purpose It seem'd that the Commissioners who were for the Nullity had enough of it and desir'd no more to bring themselves on the Stage being so by all Men exclaim'd upon for that which they had done  The Bishop of  Winton  after the Sentence went down with great Jollity full of Hope and Glory but within a while after he grew much daunted as some about him and namely his own Daughter reported for he heard many Ways of the  strange Detestation which the World had of the Deed and the nicknaming of his Son much affected him But his Advertisements from Sir  Richard Norton  his SoninLaw did much trouble him For Sir  Richard  wrote divers Times from  London  to his Wife That he could come in no Place but his FatherinLaw was rail'd upon That Men told him that he thought he had a Wife but it was no longer than my Lord of  Winton  pleas'd for whensoever he offended him he could make a Nullity between them Besides the said Sir  Richard  told Mr  John More  of  Lincoln  'sInn divers Times  That it was such a Disgrace unto him to hear how the World talk'd of that Sentence that although my Lord of  Winton  promised to give him his Wife and Family their Diet and Entertainment so long as he lived yet he would get him to his own House and live there where he had Means sufficient and not be subject to that perpetual Scorn which would follow him so long as he remain'd in his FatherinLaw's Company  By these and the like Passages it was guess'd that the rest of the Commissioners who were for the Sentence had little Comfort in themselves of that which they had done On the other Part the Archbishop and those who stood with him had their Honesty and Justice sounded out every Day more and more and many Messages were  brought them and divers Letters written unto them or shew'd them by some Friends from sundry of the Bishops in the Land from the Universities from many godly Preachers out of all Parts which was an exceeding Consolation unto them among the many Frowns which they did bear That there was an universal Concurrence of all honest Men to approve that which they had done And the Archbishop had privately from many great ones in Court and Nobles and worthy Personages elsewhere such Significations of their good Acceptance which he did that it cheer'd him much inwardly and he was nothing dismay'd  Now about the Middle of  November  the Wheel was turn'd about For since nothing could be gain'd by speaking hardly of the negative Part they thought they would make Use of them another Way and that should be by making the World believe that they had now given Approbation of the Fact And thereupon it was in Court and  London  asseverantly given out and the Fame of it went far and near That the Archbishop and the rest after more mature Deliberation had testify'd their Concurrence with the rest of the Commissioners and all now were of one Mind Men did not hastily believe this but yet divers of good Rank came and sent to the  Archbishop and the rest to know whether those things were so or no And when it was found to be but a Jargon it gave a great deal of Contentment and remov'd away much Scandal which formerly was taken Yet again afterward it was bruted the second Time That my Lord of  Canterbury  had given the King Satisfaction in the Matter and my Lord of  London  on such a  Sunday  had come and submitted himself to my Lord Chamberlain and the rest had relented Nay it went so far that in  Yelverton  the King's Solicitor and a great Dependent upon the House of  Suffolk  told Mr  Pye  the Counsellor and Mr  Cholmeley  the Earl of  Essex  's Solicitor coming unto him about Books to be drawn up for passing back the Jointure of the Lady  Frances  's Part and the Portion of the Earl of  Essex  's Part  That the gainsaying Commissioners were now consenting and the great Man beyond the Water was come over  which he knew so assuredly that  he had seen it ratify'd by the Subscription of the Archbishop and the rest  Yea farther he added that  there was great Reason at the first wherefore my Lord of  Canterbury  and the others should stand against the Separation for they had just Cause at the first to fear that this Fact might be drawn into Example and so Marriages ordinarily be violated but now it was resolv'd that no more such should be permitted and thereupon  they assented  These Things were inforc'd to be endur'd with Silence for the avoiding of Clamour and making of Trouble  But now behold an admirable Device of the Bishop of  Litchfield  which sheweth what his own Opinion was of the Validity of the Sentence I will set it down as it came to be acted  On the th of  November    Searle  the Proctor cometh to my Lord of  Canterbury  at  Lambeth  and bringeth with him a Writ of  Certiorari  out of the Chancery directed to the Commissioners in the Cause between the Lady  Frances  and the Earl of  Essex  The Archbishop was pray'd to open it and so he did and there found that four of them  sub sigillis vestris  were required to certify  Recordum Sententiae  into the Chancery The Arch bishop asked  Searle    If this were an usual Thing  Who answered  No he had not known any such Thing before  It is reply'd  What then should be the Reason thereof  Answer was made  That since the Matter was controversed in the Sentence least there should be Question of the Marriage afterwards the Earl of  Somerset  would have the Sentence lying by him under the Great Seal of  England  ratify'd  The Archbishop thought that to be but a weak Hold yet charged  Searle  to see such an Instrument drawn and a Certificate should accordingly be made On the  Wednesday  after  Barker  the Register cometh to  Lambeth  and sheweth a Form of a Draught in Paper how the Certificate should be return'd in the Names of all the Commissioners specially put down The Archbishop in the Reading of it found five or six Lines having a black Line drawn under them and thereupon the more marking the Words contained in them found that which he liked not Thereupon he ask'd  Barker    who lined those Words Barker  said  He himself did  The other asked  What was the Reason of it  And it was answer'd  Because Sir  John Bennet  and some other of the Doctors with him had disliked that Sentence  Quoth the Archbishop  And they had Reason for it Who put them first in  Barker said  None but himself  Quoth the Archbishop then  May not the Certificate stand as well without those Words as with them  To which  Barker  answer'd  Yes  Then said the Archbishop  Let them be stricken out  Here the Register with somewhat ado faintly made Answer  That the Commissioners on the other Side would by no Means have them out  The Archbishop said  Then I perceive it is a Device to entangle us I am ready to certify the Sentence as the Writ requireth but I will none of this  Barker  I am first in the Commission and for my Place sake I would have looked that I should have been conferr'd withal what had been fit to return and not to have had this Trick put  upon me that either I must certify that which crosseth my Judgment at the Time of giving the Sentence or I must be forced not to certify at all  So  Barker  departed and all was quiet until the  Monday  after at which Time the Archbishop was early at  WhiteHall  the Council sitting that Morning There in the waiting Chamber at the End of the PrivyGallery the Bishop of  Litchfield  cometh to him and saith  My Lord we have receiv'd a Writ of  Certiorari  out of the Chancery to certify the Sentence for the Nullity Yea  saith the Archbishop  and I am ready to certify it But  saith the Bishop  He who framed the Writ hath made it  sub Sigillis vestris  and doth not know that there is a Seal of Office for the Delegates it should have been  sub Sigillo Communi Before the Archbishop could reply in cometh the Lord Chancellor and to him cometh out of the next Chamber the Lord Chamberlain and then those two Lords together with the Bishop of  Litchfield  drew themselves to a Window and there had they secret Communication about the altering of the Form of the Writ as the Effect declared for that Afternoon a Cause being to be heard touching  Alimony  from Sir  Pexal Brocas  to his Lady and the Committees in it being the Bishop of  Litchfield  and Mr Chancellor of  the Dutchy and my Lord of  Canterbury  being Umpire before Mr Chancellor was come  Bembo  Deputy to the Clerk of the Crown came into the Parlour at  Lambeth  and had private Speech with the Bishop of  Litchfield  The Archbishop going out into the Garden  Litchfield  follow'd him and told him  That Mr  Bembo  had brought another Form of a Writ  and thereupon shewed him the Words  sub communi sigillo  The Archbishop bid him do as he thought good and withdrew himself into the low StoneGallery whither  Litchfield  follow'd him and used these Words  My Lord here is a Form of a Certificate which hath been thought fit to use in the Business of my Lord Chamberlain and I hear your Grace taketh Exception to some Things in it  Then he pull'd out the very Paper which  Barker  formerly had shew'd The Archbishop answer'd  My Lord have I not Reason to take Exception to these Words that  post omnimodam Veritatis disquisitionem    post probationes idoneas de jure requisitas  we gave such a Sentence For to subscribe this were to proclaim my self a dishonest Man upon Record For if these Things be true why did I deny to join in the Sentence  Quoth  Litchfield This here is true for it cannot be deny'd but some  probationes idoneae    de jure requisitae  were used and we do not say that all were  The Archbishop answered  You shall do well therefore to certify  post probationes aliquas  and I will joyn with you but as it standeth now indefinitely it will be taken as if all had been used I pray you therefore to alter the Certificate and make Things plain My Lord  quoth  Litchfield    I will deal plainly with you because the Words were in and doubt was made whether they should pass or no The King's Majesty hath been acquainted with the Business and he by a Letter from Sir  Thomas Lake  hath sent Word expressly that he will have them in  The Archbishop said  Let them then certify who will avow those Words for I cannot condescend unto them And hath not that Person done a good Office who hath informed the King hereof that Distraction may still be among the Commissioners and there may never be an End of Difference  The Bishop said  My Lord I could wish that you would yield unto the King and so give him Satisfaction  The Archbishop answer'd  What would you have me do I gave the Sentence as I was perswaded in Conscience and since that Time I have been silent and meddle no way in the Matter I did what I did upon long Deliberation and I may not in Private upon no Ground since appearing to me cross that which I have done in Publick  It was farther added  That there was Reason to suspect that they did ill Offices who held those Things still on Foot That there never was  any Man who sought to grace himself by disgracing others but it met him at the Lane's End at one Time or another  These Things passed then and after the Cause heard between Sir  Pexal Brocas  and his Wife the Bishop of  Litchfield  said to the Archbishop at his Parting  My Lord you will give us leave to certify then as we purpose  To which the Archbishop answer'd  Yea with all my Heart  The next Morning the Archbishop remember'd that by the Carriage of Things in such Fashion as was pretended he might be trick'd For if the Names of all the Commissioners were put into the Certificate and four of them might certify under a common Seal it should not be known hereafter but that he and his Fellows concurr'd therein and that with the Words which were excepted against He therefore sent for  Barker  and in the Presence of Sir  John Bennet  and two Servants being Publick Notaries he expostulated with  Barker  as serving Mens Turns rather than caring for Peace and then punctually he deliver'd these Things  First  The Writ requireth me to certify the Sentence and I am ready to do it  Secondly  If the whole Process be desir'd I am willing to certify that also  Thirdly  For the Words in Question because they were put in without my Privity and they may as well be left out as put in by your own Saying I pray to be forborn for returning of them  Fourthly  I require you to conceal these Things as much as you may that the World take no new Alarm of any Difference between the Commissioners  The Archbishop spake of returning the whole Process because he had heard that at the first it was meant it should be so but Dr  Stuart  and perhaps some other of the Civilians dissuaded that by all Means least if the whole were on Record in the Chancery every Man that list hereafter might censure that Sentence and sift the Grounds whereon the Commissioners proceeded it was good therefore to take away that Occasion  When Matters were thus resolv'd the Bishop of  Litchfield  who meant to play his Prizes in this Service speaketh to  Bembo  to draw some Preface or Conclusion to add to the Certificate that it might not only be sign'd with the great Seal as after the Form of an  Inspeximus  but that his Majesty might add a Confirmation to it And when Mr  Bembo  as unacquainted with this Fashion did not fit the Bishop's Humour his Lordship took on him to do  it himself He drew up therefore a strange Writing as was inform'd by a credible Person that saw it containing barbarous Latin and no good Congruity of Sense But the Matter of it was that his Majesty having the Authority of the Pope now in himself and in  scrinio pectoris  having Power to ratify did  ex plenitudine potestatis  confirm that Divorce to all Intents and Purposes In an Evening Dr  Martin  was sent for to the Lord Chamberlain and there was the Bishop with his Papers The Doctor as it hath been eredibly deliver'd being shew'd that Writing and his Opinion thereupon being ask'd did utterly dislike it and said  That the King claim'd nothing of the Pope's Power but took that as his own which the Pope had usmped That the King had spoke before by his Judges Delegate and had nothing more to do That if the Sentence were not good already no Confirmation could make it good  And when the Bishop was earnest in Defence of his Device there was a little Heat stricken between the Doctor and him so that these Words passed from the said Doctor  You do as much as in you lyeth spit in the Face of the King our Master by laying on him all the Matter whereas the Scandal that hath already been is this that his Majesty is said to deal so much in the Matter My Lord you are to  blame to enter into these Things without Advice of Men skilful in the Law Hath Dr  Stuart  or Dr  Bird  been acquainted herewithal  The Bishop saith  No but for this Matter I know as much Law at the best of you all  Dr  Martin  reply'd  No Your Lordship thinketh that because you have read two or three Chapters of the CanonLaw about this late Business you know as much as we do who have spent all our Lives in that Profession I tell your Lordship I have study'd the Law these two and thirty Years and therefore you shall give me leave to believe that I know more therein than you can I am the King's Advocate and therefore may suffer nothing with my Consent to pass dishonourable to my Master  Upon these Contestations the Lord Chamberlain was much troubled saying  What a Matter is this that Men should be of such contrary Opinions What shall we do  When the Bishop murmur'd much that his Conceit was not follow'd Dr  Martin  said thus  My Lord in a Business of this Importance I will not wish your Lordship to follow my single Advice but let this be done to Morrow let Sir  William Button  in your Lordship's Name come to  DoctorsCommons  and let him get together Sir  Daniel Dun  Dr  Stuart  and Dr  Bird  and I will attend them and then we will consult jointly what is fit to be done  This Advice was much liked and on the Morrow being  Friday  they all assembled and for two Hours all Points were debated but the Conclusion was  That there should be no farther Confirmation For this was to proclaim that the Sentence was defective in itself which would make a great Buzz in the World  And therefore the Counsel was in general  That too much had been done and for the Time to come the Care must be how to lay it asleep fairly  This Resolution being taken the next Knack was that so many of the Commissioners as were for the Sentence should be call'd together and they should be made acquainted with this that the Bishop might be fairly put off On the  Saturday  Night therefore in the Dark at Sir  Julius Caesar  's House in the  Strand  met the Bishops of  Ely    Litchfield    Rochester  the two Chancellors of the Exchequer and Dutchy and Sir  Daniel Dun  and well near for an Hour they privately debated what they thought fit but as it seemeth resolv'd as before and so departed  A Friend being the next Day with the Lady  Caesar  and knowing of the Meetting asked her  What about it was  She answer'd  It is something about the late Nullity but what it is I do not know It seemeth that they who were the Doers in it think  somewhat is amiss They suppose all is not well about it and I for my part think so also  A Man would have supposed that all these Things should have contented the Bishop of  Litchfield  but he was so far in Love with his own Invention that yet he would not be beat off and therefore to merit the more he once again moveth the Lord Chamberlain to send to Sir  Francis Bacon  and to Mr  Yelverton  being of the King's learned Council to know their Opinion Which being done and they two for the Reasons above named concurring with the Civilians The Bishop as it hath been credibly related said of them together with the rest  They are all Fools  And so ended this Stratagem but the Worker thereof was not yet for an End  From the Beginning of this whole Question of the Nullity the Bishop of  Litchfield  had carry'd himself variously sometimes being vehement in Words publickly against the Separation and other Times in Deed giving Furtherance to it Many Speeches he had privately with the ArchBishop making shew of much Honesty and Respect to him which the Archbishop ever warily observ'd thinking notwithstanding that these had been Testimonies of the working of his Conscience conflicting in it self but not resolv'd what to do  In the mean Time from the Court from London and out of the Country the Archbishop was still call'd upon by divers worthy Friends  That he should take heed of that Bishop that he was ever and in all Things naught That he did all the worst Offices that possibly he could and was still stirring the Coals to procure to himself a Reputation that he was zealous of the House of  Suffolk The Archbishop forgot not those many Warnings but carry'd himself very warily towards him Yet out of Charity it still came in his Mind  He is a Bishop I know no Evil of him I ought not to condemn a Man upon a Generality I have no particular Proof of his Misbehaviour in this behalf although he dealt ill with the late Lord Treasurer and most falsly with the Archbishop  Bancroft  in his Lifetime and after his Death and for that Cause was detested by both of them yet an honest Man may think that Experience hath reform'd him and now he is amended  Yet it much affected the Archbishop that all Men spake so ill of him and one Speech of an old Courtier a very honest Knight enter'd far with him For about a Fortnight before the Marriage the said Courtier speaking privately with the ArchBishop among other Words he us'd this  I know not what the Bishop of  Litchfield  doth among you but he hath made a shift  to be taken for a Knave generally with us in the Court  Now whether the next Prank will verify so much or no let the Reader judge Eight Days before the Marriage on a  Saturday  Morning that Bishop cometh to  Lambeth  and in private Conference with the Arch bishop he telleth him  That out of his Love and Respect to his Grace he was come voluntarily as of himself to know his Mind about one Matter and it was this On St  Stephen's  Day  saith he  the Lord Chamberlain meaneth to have this great Marriage go forward Now it may perhaps be desir'd that a Licence should be given by you that the Banes may not be ask'd which if you like not to grant I may be the Means to free you from being mov'd to it  The Archbishop said  What have I to do with granting of a License it belongeth not to me But wherefore should there be any Need of a License the Marriage is intended to be Publick Masks and Shews are made for the same all  England  taketh Notice of it and therefore it were good that the Banes were openly ask'd as the Manner is of such Marriages as are made in the King's Chapel Yea the Lady  Elizabeth  herself had her Banes ask'd My Lord  saith Litchfield  there is some Cause why it should be done without publishing the Banes For peradventure some  dy may step up and make a Disturbance  You know what a mad naked Fellow came in to St  James's  after the Death of the Prince if such a one should come in now what a Work would it make  The Archbishop wonder'd within himself to hear such a Reply and thought surely that it was no mad Body that they should need to stand in fear of but they suspected somewhat else But his Answer was  My Lord there come no such into the King's Chapel there be Doors and Officers to keep such out But if it should be suspected that any would oppose it is best the Banes be ask'd for then there will be some warning of the Gainsaying whereas otherwise if at the Time of the Marriage one should suddenly start up it would make a greater Trouble  Notwithstanding the Bishop went on  That a License would cut off all the Doubt  The Archbishop answer'd  But what have I to do with granting a License in the King's Chapel It belongeth to the Ordinary of the Place and that is my Lord of  Bath  as Dean of the Chapel  Litchfield reply'd  He never granted any and he hath no Seal for that Office It was answer'd He never granted any because no Body ever desir'd it but the Manner was that the Banes were publish'd But as for the Seal of the Office who doth not know that any Seal will serve and none better than his Bishop's Seal it being said  Datum sub sigillo nostro  Episcopali quo in hoc casu  or  hoc Tempore utimur  King  James  at the first did use the Seal of Queen  Elizabeth  'till a new one was made  The Bishop proceedeth  Yet it would be fit that you granted the License if it be requested  To this the Archbishop said  I shall do that which never any of my Predecessors did Yes  quoth Litchfield  If you would seek your Records you should find some so granted  The Arch bishop answer'd  I have enquir'd of my Officers and they tell me That no such thing was heard of in  Omni Hominum Memoria  But  my Lord  I know that my Lord of  Bath  hath it under the Great Seal of  England  exclusively to the Archbishop so that in direct Words there is a Restraint that he may not meddle there Yea but  quoth Litchfield  you have an Act of Parliament enabling you to grant Dispensations to the King and his Children and therefore it belongeth to you  Said the Archbishop  Do not you think that I understand the Act of Parliament as well as you  My Lord  Do you think that that Statute was made for these ordinary Graces and Dispensations Why is not your Lordship able within your Diocess to grant a License that a Marriage may be solemniz'd and not the Banes ask'd Yes  saith he  I may Nay every Archdeacon may do it within his Jurisdiction Then my Lord  quoth the Archbishop  must  an Act of Parliament be made to grant the Archbishop Power to do that which every Archdeacon may do within his Precinct There is surely some other Matter in it But I marvel my Lord that you are now so earnest for the Archbishop's Licenses when as I have heard in the Days of my Predecessor when you were Bishop of  Rochester  you would not suffer the Archbishop's Licenses to pass within your Diocess No  saith he  it was for  Westminster  that I did strive not for the Diocess of  Rochester  And it is true that there be Records in that Church that the Monks did contend with the King about divers Questions I had Reason therefore to stand for the Privileges of my Church  It was answer'd  So hath my Lord of  Bath  to stand for the Rights of the King's Chapel  The Archbishop seeing how earnest the Man was in so unreasonable a Thing said farther  My Lord  you have mine Answer but let me now tell you one thing  It is six Weeks agone that I heard from the Court and many Times since I have had it reiterated that such a Trick should be put upon me That although it needed not yet I should be mov'd for granting this License because thereby I should be constrain'd either to grant it and so cross my former Sentence and involvedly give my Consent to the Nullity or I should deny it and so grate once again upon  the King's Displeasure You see now I have given you a fair Answer which may free me from both But my Lord I pray God you do good Offices in this Business I fear you put your self into many Things which may be better forborn But let me tell you there was never any Man who sought to raise himself by wronging another but at one Time or other he had enough of it It is now almost three Months since this Sentence is given and since that Time I have not meddled with the Matter for offending the King I am silent and no way oppose and Men have their End yet cannot I be quiet I would have you know that God beholdeth these things and remembereth them And for my Part I am not blind I see well what is done and I shall not always be silent The Time will come that I must speak and it shall appear I am not Tonguety'd  This made the Bishop not so forward as before but Occasion of a farther Speech being offer'd the Archbishop went on and said  The Sentence which I gave was in the Fear of God and according to my Conscience And if that had been done which was convenient and we called for there needed not to have been any Division in Judgment For my Lord you may remember when you came to me at  Croydon  and brought these Papers from the King after the reading whereof I slept little that Night    how desirous I was to give his Majesty Satisfaction and therefore pray'd you fetching out the Process unto you to tell me whereupon I should ground my Sentence You shew'd me one Article  that he had not known her nor he thought that he never should  I told you then Yea that was for want of Love for he said  When I came out of  France  I lov'd her I do not so neither ever shall I  It is want of Love  To this the Bishop said  Yea and the Earl added  That he had done his Best oftentimes Carnally to know her but he found an Imperfection in himself The Archbishop reply'd to this  Oh my Lord Never say so for his Lordship's Answers upon his Oath are to the contrary  He found no Defect or Impediment in himself  And if I shall speak my private Opinion although I would not have you believe it I think the Earl as able a Man for a Woman as any is in  England  And I think to the contrary  Quoth Litchfield The Archbishop went on  But my Lord when your Lordship and I had these Difficulties in our Mind at  Croydon  you told me of one thing which I embrac'd as an Oracle from Heaven And that was that to rid our selves of these Distractions we had no other Way but to call the Earl of Essex again upon his Oath that so giving us a fuller Answer we might either have good Ground to pronounce for the Nullity or  Matter to give Reason why we might not condescend unto it I approv'd this and you know how the next Day in publick Court it was mov'd and my Lords of  Winchester    Ely    Rochester  and your self gave very good liking to it and no Man said any thing against it except Mr Chancellor of the Exchequer who softly spake  I know not whether that will be permitted  But you may remember you were intreated to deliver this to the King at  Theobalds  from whom you brought Word  That it should not be granted because the Earl of  Essex  being partly provok'd by his falling out with Mr  Henry Howard  and partly being counselled by the Earl of  Southampton  would speak all things to hinder the Nullity My Answer then was  That he was to speak upon his Oath and we would most strictly examine him  When that was deny'd which should have led us to the Truth I must confess I had never any mind to pronounce for the Separation The Bishop seem'd to take no great Pleasure to hear these things thus repeated but fared as if he could have wish'd that they all had been forgotten The Conclusion of all was that the Bishop seem'd to be well satisfy'd that no License was given and promis'd the Archbishop to take Care that he should no farther be troubled with it assuring him  That he did  ever good Offices to him whereof the King could give Witness and would and he would ever make the best of things  To which the Archbishop said  If he did he would take it for a Kindness at his Hands  and so he departed  Accordingly the next Day the Banes were ask'd in the Chapel and there was nothing but fair Weather the Archbishop attending the King in the Closet On the  Monday  the King went to  Hampton  Court and that Day the Bishop of  Bath  and  Wells  came to  Lambeth  He told the Archbishop that he had a direct Message unto him from the King and that was That his Majesty did much marvel that he spake not with him about the Sentence That the King expected Satisfaction and Submission His Lordship added That he perceiv'd that the King had some Scruple in his Mind which he wish'd should be remov'd before his going to the Communion on  Christmas  Day The Archbishop knew not that the Bishop of  Litchfield  had dealt any Way treacherously with him and therefore was constrain'd to answer in general that he knew not what to say to his Highness He persuaded himself that in giving of the Sentence he had done his Duty and therefore could not tell how to make a Submission where he conceiv'd no Fault  If in any Circumstance he had err'd he was ready to testify his Sorrow for it but he knew no such Thing yet if his Majesty was displeas'd at him to signify his Obedience to his King and Sovereign to whom he was so much bound he would not refuse if the King were pleas'd to restrain him of his Liberty and lay him in the Tower all the Days of his Life to submit himself unto it patiently without Murmuring  Furthermore he pray'd the Bishop of  Bath  and who on the Morrow was to go to  Hampton  Court to signify humbly to his Majesty That he had nothing in this World more precious than his Life and that he wish'd that he had given that Life as a Redemption that the King's Hand had never been in that Business And withal he said that at the coming of the King he would attend his Majesty  On  Wednesday  Night the King came to  WhiteHall  and on the  Thursday  after Dinner my Lord of  Canterbury  went to the Court where they were all busy about Plate and Jewels against the Marriage Notwithstanding he had hastily Speech of divers Matters with the King and in the End he said privately unto his Highness  May it please your Majesty I understand    by my Lord of  Bath and Wells  That your Majesty expects that I should give you an Account about the Matter of the Lord of  Essex  and the Lady  Frances  I can say nothing more than this That I was put into the Commission as a Judge and at the Time of Sentence I did my Conscience and since I have not meddled with the Matter Yes  saith the King  I hear you deny'd a License to be granted for not asking of the Banes which I wonder you would do since the Sentence was pass'd No  said the Archbishop  I deny'd no License but I advis'd that the best Course was that the Banes should be ask'd according to the Custom us'd in the Chapel  Secondly I said  That if any License should be granted it belong'd not to me to give it but to the Ordinary of the Place the Dean of the Chapel who hath it under your Majesty's Great Seal exclusive to the Archbishoprick Yea  said the King  My Lord of  Bath  said so but I am told it is otherwise  The Archbishop reply'd  Nay it is so indeed  And thirdly said he  My Answer was That never any of my Predecessors granted License for any Thing done in the King's Chapel I have receiv'd Information so from my Officers It had then been Presumption in me to attempt that which belong'd not unto me This is another  ther Matter  saith the King  Were these your Answers I was told otherwise But I will take some other Time to speak with you  The Archbishop after this attended half an Hour and nothing being said he departed  The same Night a Friend coming to  Lambeth  told my Lord  That he had been that Day with the Lord  Knowles  where he found that the Bishop of  Litchfield  had exceedingly wrong'd my Lord of  Canterbury  For he had reported all the Speech about the License in a spiteful Manner said it was absolutely deny'd That the Archbishop gave out  That the Earl of  Essex  was very Potent for a Woman and that he intended to question this new Marriage at one Time or other that it should never take effect  This said the Gentleman made a great Stir among them and the Archbishop was much blamed that he would never make an End But they were much troubled at it as fearing themselves that all was not sure  But  quoth he  when I had told them that this was some ill Office of the Bishop of  Litchfield  who had every Day new Inventions to puzzle them that he might so much the more indear himself unto them by signifying his Zeal for them and that I knew how fairly my Lord of  Canterbury  had answer'd him  for so indeed he did  and that he was  so far from disturbing the Marriage that he intended to be present at it they were not only appeased but seem'd much content that his Grace would be there And this I assure you to be true  When the Archbishop heard this he was now satisfy'd that the Man who had done him all the Wrong was the Bishop of  Litchfield  from whom he resolv'd afterward to be very wary how he trusted him Yet professing that he forgave him with all his Heart on the  ChristmasDay  he attended the King and receiv'd the Communion with his Majesty and so coming Home to Dinner Sir  Charles Cornwallis  came along with him This Gentleman is one to whom for his Love the Archbishop was much beholden and after Dinner they grew privately into Speech of all these foreremember'd Stirs where the Knight found much Fault that so many Tricks were put upon the Archbishop blam'd infinitely the Bishop of  Litchfield  promised to acquaint some of his great Friends with his Qualities and assured to make Things be rightly understood and took away with him that Report wherein he seemed much to joy that the Archbishop would be at the Marriage  On the Morrow being St  Steven  's Day the Archbishop went to the Court attended  the King to Chapel went down to the Marriage where not the King but the LordChamberlain gave the Bride had a Pair of WeddingGloves and so came Home to Dinner where he sate with much Comfort as being glad that since Things must be so they were come to an End And so pray'd God to bless his Church the King and Kingdom and himself that he might be free from so many Vexations as for a long Space undeservedly had follow'd him  The SPEECH intended to be spoken at  Lambeth    September  by the Archbishop of  Canterbury  when it came to his Turn to declare his Mind concerning the Nullity of Marriage between the Earl of  Essex  and the Lady  Frances Howard  Seven of the Commissioners having before declared themselves that they would Sentence for a Nullity and great Reason being to think that the Bishop of  London  Sir  John Bennet  Dr  James  and Dr  Edwards  would give Voices against the Nullity  _MY Lords and you the rest of the Commissioners I have had a great Contention and Deliberation within my self in what manner I should utter my Judgment in this present Cause  since after the Speech of those Three who first began so great a Stream and Concurrence together of the rest my Lord excepted who spoke last have given their Opinions for the annulling of the Marriage But yet I hold not my self concluded thereby but that I may declare my Judgment having learned that  Suffragia  among Wisemen are as well  appendenda  and  ponderanda  as  numeranda  And it was no shame for  Phocion  in  Athens  upon good Ground to contradict the whole City neither was  Paphnusius  in the Council of  Nice  the less respected when he stood against the whole Synod nay it was his Honour that by delivering of his Sentence he altered the Resolution which that whole Assembly had intended to take which I freely acknowledge I have no hope to affect at this Time And yet though I have not that hope but might very well spare this labour yet my Conscience telleth me that it becometh me to speak in a Matter of this importance because not only  Deum timeo  I fear God which I doubt not but all of this Company doth but I am afraid of God least he should be angry with me if in this Case I be silent And I think it is expected of me since I am here present that I should not sit as an Idol and only fill a room for that were to lay an Imputation on my self that I had undertaken a Cause which in publick I durst not offer to maintain  I must acknowledge that in delivering of my Mind in this Business of so great Weight I do find two defects that I cannot so pertinently speak unto the Purpose as divers of the Judges here The one is That I am no Lawyer and the other is That I am no married Man by both which I am disabled that I cannot speak with that Confidence concerning some Particulars as most of you the Commissioners are able to do but in lieu thereof I have endeavoured to furnish my self some other way concurrent to this Purpose As by reading by conferring with some whom I do trust with pondering thereupon so that it hath lost me much sleep at several Times with frequent Prayer unto God that he would direct me aright which I have more begged of God in this Cause than ever in any that was before me in Judgment And besides I bring with me  animum candidum  a Mind devoid of Passion or any Perturbation which inclineth to no part for fear or for favour for spleen or for hatred From which I thank God in pronouncing of Sentence I ever have been free remembring that Judges are in the Place of God and as  Jehosophat  said  Chron    Non hominis judicia exercetis sed Domini quicquid judicaveritis in vos redundabit  He then who sitteth in the Place of God and in pronouncing of Sentence will vary from  Justice he leaveth God and sheweth himself worthy to lye in the flames of Hell for abusing of the Trust which is committed unto him which I hope I shall not do And  cui boni  to what end should I transgress in Judgment for either side when I have no reason to be partial for either since it is indifferent to me in any particular whether this Question receive one or other determination  Where least I should be mistaken I think it not amiss as publickly I have done divers Times before to let the World know what my Judgment is concerning the Impotency of a Husband towards his Wife That since Marriage in young Couples is for carnal Copulation and Procreation thereupon and that it is the intendment of those which contract Matrimony to receive Satisfaction in that Kind that if this Nobleman be not able to perform those marital Rights unto his Lady he doth unto her a very great Injustice to retain her as his Wife and we shall perform a great part of Injury and Cruelty towards her if we do not free her from this Burthen and Yoke We are bound in Conscience to do it since it is in truth no Marriage but a pretended Matrimony that Consummation being wanting which was one of the first Things in Intention when they two came together For  impossibilitas officii  by a received Maxim  solvit vinculum Conjugij  But the Point is that before this Separation be pronounced it must appear unto the Church that there is good Cause for the same which must not be upon light Surmises or questionable Suggestions but upon evident Declarations and Proofs which may give full Contentment to the Conscience of the Judge The Marriage was overt and in the Face of the Church whereby they were joyned into one let the Reason of Separation be as clear as that was if it possibly may be or let it be so apparent that the Church may well know that there is ground to stand upon for pronouncing of a Nullity Now this is it which I doubt will not fall out in this Case of my Lord of  Essex  there is not proof sufficient to inform the Minds of the Judges that this knot should be dissolved and themselves set at liberty the one from the other And then you understand what the general Rule is  Quod dubitas ne feceris  And in this Controversy there seems in my Judgment many Reasons of doubting that the Separation desired ought not to be granted You shall hear some few of them  The first Scruple which ariseth in my Mind is from the uncertainty of that Proceeding which we have had in this Busisiness For in the handling of it formerly we had it propounded that there must be  a Nullity  propter maleficium versus hanc  That was it which we debated and for the which we turned our Books that the Counsel for my Lady did still insist upon not naming the Words indeed but by a Periphrasis or Circumlocution describing the same And it cannot be forgotten how Dr  Stuard  being told by one or more of the Commissioners sitting then in Court that his whole Speech did still point out  maleficium  he answered it is true that is it which we intend The Authorities always brought out of the Canonists were in direct Terms upon  maleficium  the Proofs intended nothing else And we all understand that to have an Impotency unto a Man's own Wife and an Ability unto other and that incurably and that for some Latent Reason which cannot be known is the Case of  maleficium  and that is the matter alledged in the Libel and whereupon my Lord is examined And yet now since we sit upon the second Commission  maleficium  is disclaimed One of my Lords  My Lord of  Winchester  hath avowed it that he dislikes that  maleficium  that he hath read  DelRio  the Jesuit writing upon that Argument and doth hold him an idle and fabulous Fellow that he rather supposeth it to be God's own handy Work than any Thing from the Devil Another of  my Lords  My Lord of  Ely  hath assented thereunto and  maleficium  must be gone Now I for my part will not absolutely deny that Witches by God's Permission may have a Power over Men to hurt all or part in them as by God they shall be limitted but how shall it appear that this is such a Thing in the Person of a Man The Question is  An factum sit  and how it shall be discovered But to make it a Thing ordinary as the  Romish  Writers do beyond the Seas I take it to be a Fable acknowledging that for Truth which a Bishop well versed in that Argument did lately write that Maleficiation is the very garbage of Popery a Thing so base that we who have learned Christ aright should despise and contemn allowing it no place amongst us Which Course it were a shame if we should not observe since the Papists themselves grow very weary of it and that even in  France  where there hath been more ado with this Maleficiation than in any other Country for there the common Sort at the Time of their Marriages were wont to be afraid to have the Words of Conjunction in Matrimony to be spoken aloud  Quos Deus conjunxit nemo separet  or the Benediction to be publickly given lest some Witch or Sorcerer in the same Instant should tye a knot upon a Point or play  some other sorcering Trick whereby the new Bridegroom so long as that knot lasted should be disabled from actual Copulation with her whom he had married And for avoiding of that hazard they had therefore their Matrimonies celebrated in the Night Time and in some private Place where none came but such Friends as they dared to trust This Superstition grew so common and Men were so abused by the fright that came thereof that the Prelates of  France  about Thirty Years since in a Council at  Rheimes  made this Decree against it  Bochellus  in Decret Eccles Gallic  lib    tit    cap    Anno    Peccare graviter admonemus eos qui noctu vel clanculum benedictionem nuptialem sibi dari procurant propter metum maleficij Maleficium enim se vitare posse credere debent si eo pietatis affectu ad conjugium accedant qui praescribitur in sacris literis videlicet ut cum timore Domini amore filiorum magis quam libidine impulsi copulentur devotè susceptis paenitentiae Eucharistiae Sacramentis  And the Year after that another Council in that Kingdom doth speak yet more plainly  Idem    lib    tit    cap  ex Concilio Bituricensi  Anno    Et quia Christiano nomine indignus error nostro seculo inolevit ut signationibus consignationibus vinculis nexibus Matrimonia impediantur Haec Synodus communione  Ecclesiae interdicit omnes eos qui hujusmodi superstitionibus utuntur monetque fideles ne hujusmodi commentis fidem habeant sed in Deo fiduciam certam constituant nec id circò matrimonia noctu fiant sed in luce frequentia hominum  If it be rotten ripe in  France  if it be Error  indignus Christiano nomine  if Men must not  fidem habere hujusmodi commentis  what do we with it here in  England  let it be cast away as a rotten Rag of Popery And yet I do now find that in the very Sentence which is this Day to be given it falleth directly upon the Description of  maleficium versus hanc  So that what should I think of this Case of my Lords which is built on such a Foundation as no Man will stand to We are on it and off it and avow it we dare not yet fly from it we will not This moveth Scruple in me how I should assent to that whereof I can learn no certainty from the Council of my Lady nor from you that be the Judges who speak for this Nullity I dare not rest my Building on such a sandy Foundation  Another Matter which troubleth my Mind is the Novelty of that which is now set on Foot a Thing unheard of in our Church and unknown in our Kingdom We have many Stories Old and New of Things done in this Land we have Registers extant in every Diocese we have Acts and Records which specify those Accidents  which have fallen out in the Days of our Forefathers I have caused search in many Places to be made and so I know have some of you the Commissioners and I have called upon you for the same but I can have no Precedent of any such Example that hath passed in our Kingdom No Memory of Man can express unto me the Name of that Person whose Marriage was annull'd for Impotency towards his Wife when he found an Ability of carnal Copulation with any other Woman It is this Year that hath set Abroad this present Imagination for the former Ages knew it not It is safe walking in the Ways which are treaded out unto us We have great Reason for our doings in these Human Actions when we do those Deeds which formerly were done by our Predecessors I have had many worthy Men which have gone before me in the Place which I now hold Men learned Men judicious great discoverers of Impostures Men that have done great Services for the Nation where we live but of them never any had such a Case before them they never gave Sentence for a Nullity of Marriage upon such an inability I know not whether it be a happiness or unhappiness that I must be the first to sit in a Commission for determining such a Controversy  I know to meet with this Objection it is whispered sometimes that there is an Example and that is  Bury  's Case which is urged as a Precedent unto this now in Question But indeed that is no Pattern of this the dissimilitude is great between the one Case and the other for  Bury  had his Stones stricken off with an Horse that nothing but a little part of one of them remained I will read you the very Case which if any Man doubt of shall be avowed unto him Thus then it doth follow  John Bury  Esquire was lawfully seised in his Demeanes as of Fee of and in divers Mannors Lands and Tenements within the County of  Devon  The said  John Bury  did the th Day of  November  in the first Year of Queen  Mary  marry one  Willimot Gifford  and they lived together Three Years and the said  Bury  could not  carnaliter cognoscere dictam Willimotam  Afterwards  viz  the th of  May  the said  Willimot  called the said  Bury  before the Ecclesiastical Judge and charged him to be  impotentem ad coeundum cum dicta  Willimota  propter vitium perpetuum incurabile impedimentum ad generationem ejus inhabilitatem  c and thereupon desired to be divorced In the Proceeding before the Judge it was proved by divers Witnesses of which two were Physicians that the said  Bury  had but one little Stone and  that no bigger than a Bean It was also deposed by divers Matrons that the said  Willimot Gifford  remained a Virgin and incorrupt and the said  Bury  confessed no less Upon which Proof and Confession of  John Bury  the Ecclesiastical Judge pronounced Sentence of Divorce and did thereby separate them  Afterward the said  John Bury  took to Wife one  Philip Monjoy  his first Wife  Willimot Gifford  being then alive and the said  Philip  had a Son in the Time of their continuing together  John Bury  's first Wife being alive  Afterwards the said  Willimot  being still living the said  Monjoy  of her own accord without any Sentence of Divorce forsook the said  John Bury  and married one  Langeden  with whom she continued The said  John Bury  and his first Wife  Willimot  died the said  Monjoy  and  Langeden  then living married together  The Question is Whether  John Bury  being divorced from  Willimot Gifford  for Impotency the second Marriage solemnized between the said  John Bury  and  Monjoy  during which Time the Issue Male was born be in Law a Marriage or not  It appeareth by the Process made in the Cause and the Words of the Sentence grounded upon the same Process that the first Marriage was pronounced to be void  Propter defectum vitium testiculorum  which made the said  John Bury    impotentem ineptum ad actum generandi coitum conjugalem  And so in all Respects this second Marriage with  Monjoy  is void and of no effect For either this Cause of the Dissolution of the first Matrimony is true which is always to be presumed until the contrary do appear and then the same Cause doth make the second Marriage void also or else if it any ways appear this Cause of the Dissolution of the first Marriage to be false  Et Ecclesia erat decepta quia satis potens ad generandum quod in ipsa generavit  And in that Case the first Marriage is good in Law  debet redire ad priora connubia  And so the second Marriage is utterly void  We are of the Opinion above laid down  John Loyde  Henry Jones  John Hone  Nicolas Stuard  Edward Crompton  Robert Fourth  William Farrand  Whether this be true or no I appeal to Dr  Stuard  who is here in Presence and of Counsel for my Lady who I know will affirm it because not long since being asked by me of it he confessed the same And here is Dr  Farrand  now of  Counsel for my Lord who was usedfor his Advice in this Case of  Bury  and Dr  Hone  is yet living who can testify the same For I will suppose that a Man cannot forget such a famous Case as that was wherein himself was employ'd but if all these were dead I know where Records be which still will continue If this then were the Matter in Question touching  Bury    defectus testiculorum  what is this to the great Controversy now depending before us And if this be the only Precedent that should be the Inducement that the Sentence to be given in this Cause is not new but the like hath been heard of before I am where I was We are now to act a Novelty a thing strange and unheard of in this Church of  England  whereof let other Men be the Managers I may have no hand in it  But perhaps it will be said that in some other Countries and especially in  France  these things are well known and the Examples of one Kingdom especially being so near unto us may be an Inducement for us to do the like since the Reason is the same My Answer thereunto is That I that live in  England  am to frame my self to those things which I find in the Church of  England  whereof I see no reason but there should be as great Esteem as of any Church in the World In the Days of our  Forefathers as our Nation was held a very noble Nation so was the Church of  England  held a very famous Church  Ecclesia Anglicana  as might easily be shewed out of  Matthew Paris  and by divers things in some later general Councils did carry a greater Sway And why should we at this time in any thing yield unto any Church in the World since it is a thing well known that the Knowledge of Divinity doth abound here beyond all other Nations and Men of this Land have beat down the Power of the Pope and made evident divers Quesions in Matters of Theology beyond all the Parts of Christendom But beyond this I do know that the Customs of Churches even by the Determination of the Pope himself ought to be the Rule of Judgment in this Nature We have a famous Place interserted into the Body of the Law written by Pope  Alexander  the d unto the Bishop of  Amiens  in  France  It is worth your hearing  De frigidis maleficiatis cap in Supplemento  Quod sedem Apostolicam consuluisti super his quae tibi dubia existunt gratum gerimus acceptum tua exinde fraternitas non parum commendanda videtur Ex tua siquidem parte nobis est intimatum quod quaedam mulier tui Episcopatus cuidamviro nupserit asserens quod os utrius{que} inguinis rupturam genitalia  ejus abscissa fuissent nec dum ab eo cognito fuisset qui uti{que} factus leprosus se pariter sua domui reddidit infirmorum Mulier vero ad domum patris reversa sicut asseris invenis alii viro nubere desiderat conjugali affectu conjungi Ʋnde licet Romana Ecclesia non consueverit propter talem infirmitatem vel propter alia maleficia legitimè conjunctos dividere si tamen consuetudo generalis Gallicanae Ecclesiae habet ut hujusmodi matrimonium dissolvatur nos patienter tolerabimus si secundum eandem consuetudinem eidem mulieri cui voluerit nubendi in Domino concesseris facultatem  By this we do find that the Church of  Rome  it self doth grant no Separations in Matters of Matrimony where the Church of  France  doth and if the Pope permit in  France  it self that a Divorce should be made it is but a Toleration and not this neither but where it is  consuetudo generalis Ecclesiae Gallicanae  which if you will apply unto this Cause in Question you must shew me that in  England  it hath been a general Custom that a Nullity in Marriage may be pronounced  propter impotentiam versus hanc  which if you cannot shew as indeed you cannot nor give any true Example that ever hath been of any such Separation within this Church I may both in Law and Conscience conclude that I dare not introduce any Novelty and so consequently pronounce for the Nullity of  this Marriage Many things are done in  France  whereof if we in  England  had the Examination we should peradventure find the Fact different from that which they conceiv'd or if we agree in the Fact we should give another Sentence It is not unknown how within the Space of one Year there hath been much ado in  France  about two Women  Magdalen  and  Louyse  pretended to be possessed with a great many Devils and how  Verrine  a principal Spirit in one of them hath avowed and maintained the Mass Invocation of Saints Adoration of Images and a great many other Points of the Grossness of Popery and a Book hereof hath been printed and reprinted in  Paris  with Approbation of the State and Allowance of learned Men in which the Church of  England  would certainly dissent and proclaim the whole Business to be but an Imposture as the very like was in the Days of Queen  Elizabeth  when the Devils of  Denham  were said to possess  Sarah Williams  and her Sister and some other Persons and much ado was made of it and divers fond People believing those Knacks turn'd Papists thereupon yet the Issue of all was that it proved no better than a shameful Delusion and a great abusing of credulous and lightbelieving Persons  But now to proceed farther if it shall be said It is not the Novelty nor the Want of Custom here in  England  which should prejudice the Truth  valeat veritas  wheresoever or whensoever it appears The Proofs are evident whereupon we do stand and that will enforce the Sentence My Answer thereunto is let that be made manifest and clear and perspicuous unto the Conscience of an understanding Man and I shall concur with you but how shall I find this in a Matter of this Quality Because it is nothing else but Truth which we do aim at it were fit that all Probations if not which are possibly yet at the least which reasonably may be had should be got together to enforce a Conclusion of this Consequence My Books tell me  In valore matrimonii investigando quaecun{que} probationes possibiles adhibendae sunt potius debent esse superfluae quàm diminutae  It is  Solomon  's Saying  Prov  It is the Honour of a King to find out a thing  And wherein can Judges bestow their Time better in a Point of Difficulty than to search and search again by all honest and good Means to know what is the Bottom of that which lieth secret that so they may satisfy their own Conscience and the Conscience of others in the Sentence which they give and leave no kind of Scruple which may trouble their own  Thoughts Whether these things have been done in this present Case I appeal to your own Consciences whether the Writers do not mention divers things whether the Council for my Lord have not spoke of sundry Matters whether we that be the Judges have not thought of divers Courses convenient to be held of all which no Piece or Parcel hath been permitted unto us The Proofs then which we have had do arise only out of the Depositions and if there be not Proof sufficient where shall we seek for it Let us then consider them I will tell you my Opinion of them I find nothing in them all which is not in Substance contained in the Answers of my Lord of  Essex  a noble Personage saith that in the hearing of divers things the Earl hath said that he was not able to know his Lady carnally the Earl thinking this to be true But this is but a Relation of Wonder spoken extrajudicially and therefore for the understanding of the Truth therein we are to have Recourse unto that which by the said Earl is judicially deposed Divers Witnesses do speak that the Earl and the Lady have lived and lain together for divers Years my Lord doth acknowledge it in his Answer the Matrons and Midwives do declare that in their Judgment my Lady is a Virgin and therefore that she was never known  carnally by the Earl himself confesseth that he did never know her So that now all in Substance depending upon his Lordship's Answer it ought to be our Labour to scan that exactly and to judge of it circumspectly Doth not he then say  in responsione ad quartum  that tho' divers times in the first Year of their Cohabitation he did attempt to know her which divers times may be twice or thrice and no more yet in the two latter Years he did never attempt it But doth he not say plainly  in responsione ad tertium  that since the time of his Marriage he had not nor hath any Sickness or Impediment to hinder him but that he might have had and may have carnal Knowledge with a Woman This is for the General that he hath no Impediment but  in responsione ad quintuni  doth he not descend more particularly unto his own Lady that it is true that he did never carnally know the said Lady  Frances  Mark now what followeth but that to the Act of carnal Copulation he did not find any Defect in himself Indeed he was not able to penetrate into her Body but he layeth the Faults of that upon her as may be seen in his Answer unto the th Article And it may not be forgotten that in the End of the Answer to the th Article he saith that sometimes she refused him these things are evident and  cannot be denied The only Matter which maketh shew against this is that he acknowledgeth that he hath lain by her and hath had no Motion to have carnal Knowledge of her but especially that in the End of his Answer unto the th Article and believeth he never shall These Words are the Shield and Buckler of the contrary part but how easily do they vanish away or fall to the Ground For I appeal unto you all who were present at the Examinations and those were ten of us in Number who now sit here present whether the Earl did not openly subjoin that to his Answer  When I came out of  France  I did love her but I do not so now neither ever shall I  I appeal unto the Conscience of you all except my Lord of  Winton  and my Lord of  Rochester  who were not then Commissioners whether this be so or no here then is the Matter it is the Want of Love which restraineth all Motions of carnal Concupiscence and not any Impotency it is  defectus voluntatis  and not  defectus potestatis  Let Discontentment be removed and there will be an End of all the Inability Married Men best know these things but out of common Reason there can be no great Longing where there is no great Liking many things they say fall out between Man and Wife that for some good Space of time  there is no carnal Conjunction and yet no Impotency concluded thereby may be The Case is famous of  Pulcheria  Sister unto the Emperor  Theodosius  the younger who having vowed Virginity was notwithstanding afterward for great Reason of State thought fit to be marry'd unto  Martianus  who thereupon was chosen Emperor she would not condescend thereunto till she had Promise from him that her Virginity should be preserved and with such a Promise he did marry her so that they lived together in Shew as Man and Wife but indeed as a Brother and a Sister Our Stories do make mention that he who was called Saint  Edward  in  England  I mean King  Edward  the Confessor did marry a Lady the Knowledge of whose Body he never had neither did this wedded Couple ever endeavour to break their Virginity The Writers do declare no other Reason hereof but that they had an Opinion that to live in Virginity was the more meritorious according to the Superstition of those times Now were it not a strange Argument to conclude in this manner that because  Martianus  had not conjugal Copulation with  Pulcheria  therefore he was a Man impotent or because King  Edward  had not carnal Knowledge of his Wife therefore he could not know her I know the Circumstances of this present Question do  differ from those but the Ground of the Argument is the same Want of Act upon private Reason will never enforce a Want of Power And this is our Case as I understand it which maketh me unwilling to consent to this Nullity  There followeth now another Argument which I shall deliver briefly We have always agreed that the Chapter in the Law which containeth our Case is the Chapter  Litera de frigidis maleficiatis  for if it be not there it is no where to be found When we have deliver'd many things appertaining to this Cause out of the best Writers of the former Ages or of our own time as that my Lord should be inspected or that Physicians should use their Art to discern and remove Impotency if any were to be found or that Fasting Prayer and Alms should be exercised to overcome this Evil and divers other Points of like Nature it hath still been answered to us to say the Interpreters but it is not in the Law or it is in the Decrees which bind not but it is not in the Decretals or it is a Council and Exhortation but it is no Mandate or Injunction I now therefore mention some things which is in the Law and in the very Body of this Law and it is the Pope's Mandate and that is that my Lord should have given his  juramentum cum septima manu  as well as  my Lady for Want whereof the whole Proceeding is annullated This is the Pope's Commandment  Quocirca mandamus  and it requireth the Oath of both  ipsis cum septima propinquorum manu firmantibus juramento se commisceri carnaliter nequivisse  then  proferatis divortii sententiam inter eos  This is a thing so clear that when on  Thursday  last by chance there fell mention of it the Council for my Lady  Dr Stuard Dr Byrde  were so far from giving Answer to it that to speak plainly they stood as Men blasted or blighted with a Lightning and knew not which way to turn them as was manifest not only unto us but to all the Standers by which I do not utter to do them any wrong for they are worthy Men both learned and faithful to the Cause which they undertake but the Note is that this Objection can receive no true Answer I know that since that time there hath been Labour made to give a Salve to this Sore but no Man's Wit can do it I said and say still that no Man's Loquence neither any Man's Eloquence can perswade me that  ipsis firmantibus juramento  is of the singular Number I know there hath been tumbling and turning of Books to find some Shew to meet with this Objection but nothing can be found which will hold out this Water The Proceeding therefore  doth appear to be unperfect and defective in that which is mainly required by the Law which makes me to conclude in this fashion against some unperfect Speech touching my Lord of  Essex  his affirming or denying of his own Inability towards my Lady that either he doth confess it or deny it If he do acknowledge it where is then his Oath  cum septima Manu  which the Law imposeth If he do deny it where is then your Proof of his Inability since you ground the whole Substance of the Nullity upon his Lordship's Answer  That he could not know her carnally  I must yet crave Patience to go a little farther One other Exception which I take unto this Nullity is the manner of the Sentence which by us is to be given which hath ever been resolved should be in general not expressing any Reason particular wherefore we do give it To say that my Lord is  impotens in genere versus hanc  and not to tell wherein is to propound a Riddle to the World which no Man understandeth It were a strange Thing in Learning to say that such a Creature is Animal and not to tell whither it be a Man or a Horse or a Fish or a Bird And although it hath been said and strongly maintain'd  Sir Julius Caesar Sir Daniel Dun  That it is enough in a Sentence to pronounce a Thing in general and that  the Judge is bound to give no Reason of it  yet I would be glad to know whether howsoever I will conceal the particular Reason from the Hearers or Standers by yet were it not fit that I who am the Judge and must give the Sentence or at least consent unto it should know the Ground whereupon I do give it Give me leave to speak my Conscience I think such a Sentence that  propter latens aliquod impedimentum  which is  perpetuum incurabile versus hanc  is nothing but a device to serve a present Turn which we must deliver in such obscure Words to blind Posterity that comes after and to amuse those which will inquire into it as if we had known something which we held not fit to utter when in Truth we know nothing I find the Texts of the Law do still set down the Reason and give a Case particular as Frigidity or Section or unfitness of the generative Part or some such other Matter but for an Inability  propter latens impedimentum  my dulness is such that in the whole Book I cannot discover it And it is a Mystery that cannot enter into me how a Man should be potent unto other Women and impotent to his Wife if it be not in Case of Phrensy which is not  latens impedimentum  and which also findeth  lucida intervalla  Cap Litterae  It was the Assertion of him in the Law  That he did not  know his Wife but that he had a Power to know other Women  But what wise Man doth believe him Or what is there in the Text which doth declare it to be true I will end this Point with that of our Saviour in the th of St  Matthew  That there are three Sorts of Eunuchs or Men unfit to marry the one is of God's making the second is of Mens making and the third is of their own making The first are they that are past from their Mother's Belly who either are  frigidi  or such as have not Members fit for Generation or some apparent Debility The second are those who are castrated by Men or by some violence have that hindred in them whereunto by Nature they are fit in respect of Procreation I will not here dispute that idle  Maleficium  because your selves are flown from it The third hath no coherence with this Nobleman Let me know then in which of the former two you do place it Is he past from his Mother's Womb why then do you give him leave to marry again that he who hath deluded and frustrated one may also delude another If he be in the second Rank why do you not tell us what the Violence is which he hath sustained from Men or from any other Creature Let us have I pray you some kind of Satisfaction and let not this Aenigma in general blind us least the World should say  that wilfully we shut our Eyes against the Truth  One Reason I have more why I yield not to this Nullity and then I have done It is drawn from the Inconveniencies which will follow thereupon if we dissolve the Matrimony in such Case as is now desired I look first on the detriment and harm which will follow if the Marriage do continue in force and in vigour and I do find that all the inconvenience doth redound but to one Person Between a Lady and her Husband there is some discontentment which Time and God's Grace may easily remove There is then an end of that Controversie Or if the disagreement shall never be appeased it is no more but one Lady doth want that Solace which marital Conjunction would afford unto her which many a good Woman is enforced to endure and yet commits no Sin neither labours to violate the Laws of the Church For suppose the Husband be sick of some long Disease or languishing Weakness must not the Wife sustain it with patience and quietness Suppose the Husband be Captive in some Forreign Nation or Prisoner in his own Country whereby occasion of marital Complexion is taken from the Wife no Divine will pronounce that a Separation is in this Case to be sought Let a Woman do that in Modesty which others are inforced to do  out of Necessity and let her expect God's leisure in Fasting and in Prayer and in other Humiliation This is all the Inconvenience which ariseth to one Person if she have not the Performance of conjugal Duty  But look on the other side what are the Incongruities or rather Absurdities which will easily follow if such Dissolutions of Marriages be permitted I will name only two The first is the hazard of violating and annulling of Marriage by an ordinary Practice for if the Gap be open who will not run in And the Judge must dispense the Law indifferently to all if the Proofs be accordingly for we may not say that it is for noble Personages and great Peers in the State and not for others of inferiour Rank Whatsoever Couple therefore have no Children and live discontented come presently to take part of this general Jubilee And albeit they know in their Consciences that it which they attempt is unlawful yet to satisfy their Fancy they will collude the one with the other and enter a Prosecution secretly agreed upon howsoever in open shew they seem to differ the one from the other And who can doubt but for Money or Favour they may procure Witnesses and others who are to be used by the formality of the Law to testify and depose so much as serves the Turn By which means we are at a fair pass when  not only the Marriage Bed shall be defiled and Adulteries made frequent which is against the second Table of the Law but Perjury shall be committed and God's Name taken in vain which is repugnant unto the first Table  A second Inconvenience is the Danger least both Parties which are freed from their Matrimony should divers Years after be returned to it again when perhaps the Husband by a second Wife hath Children and the Wife by a second Husband hath store of Issue also for there is no doubt in the Law but if a Man supposed to be  frigidus  and therefore divorced shall afterwards Marry and by begetting of Children shew himself not to be impotent but apt for Generation this Man is to be taken from his second Woman and returned to his first Wife and the Woman for whose Marriage a Nullity was pronounced in respect of the Insufficiency of her Mate must be now taken from her second Companion and returned to the first Of this the Reason is apparent  quia decepta est Ecclesia  they adjudged him to be impotent upon wrong Information whom Experience and Truth hath declared to be potent And what Man can foretel how variety of Times may produce other Judgments There may be Question of Land or Inheritance of Legitimation or Illegitimation and a wise  Man would be unwilling to bring it on the Stage when he is dead and gone and to make it the Fable of the World whether his Children be born lawfully or to be reputed in the Rank of Bastards The World is subject to much mutability and Judges of future Times may peradventure be led with the Power of some great Persons and perhaps may think upon other Considerations that it is but a Conceit that a Man should be potent unto another Woman and impotent to his Wife or that the Common Law doth not know any  Maleficium  or that they do not believe that there may be  latens impedimentum perpetuum  and  incurabile versus hanc  when they see that the Husband is in shew of the World a lusty able Man and hath well proved his Potency by begetting Three or Five or Seven or Ten Children upon another Woman These are pretty Things if a Man do well consider them and will serve to make distraction between Kinsman and Kinsman and make work for the Lawyers and keep the Courts at  Westminster  that they shall not be idle which if we could not learn otherwise yet  Bury  's Case before remember'd doth teach us who was divorced from his Wife in the d or th Year of Queen  Elizabeth  and when his Brother had enjoyed his Land until the th Year of the said Queen then was he thrust out of it and  the question'd Son or his Heir was put into Possession of it by Trial of Law a great deal of Money being spent in that Contention and both Civilians and common Lawyers in great Numbers were entertain'd of both Sides and yet the Controversy was not so appeased but that of my certain Knowledge within these three Years it had been raised again and a strong device was laid how to bring this about again only my self withstood it and would not give way unto it when I was divers Times consulted thereabout conceiving very well that it would not be long before some Prohibition would come out of some of the King's Courts because the common Law disliked that Mens Inheritance especially after Judgments should be disturbed when the Parties whom most of all it concerned are dead long before and cannot answer for themselves whereas peradventure if themselves had been living they could have answered that for themselves which other Men know not And there ought to be a settled Course in all Things appertaining to Inheritance  By this Time I hope you see that it is not out of willfulness or prejudicate Conceit that I have impugned this Nullity but out of ground of Reason and out of scruple of Conscience which is it that must accuse me or excuse me before the everliving  God I know you have heard what other Men have said and they have answered for themselves Upon all which Grounds I make this Conclusion That howsoever this Matter of Separation with great earnestness hath been persued yet it is the surer and the safer way to leave it as we find it and in no Case to dissolve it I oft remember that Saying which is frequent among the Canonists  Tolerabilius est aliquos contra statuta hominum dimittere copulatos quam conjunctos legitimè contra statuta Domini separare  That concerneth us who be the Judges and for the Parties themselves who perhaps can be content to be severed and to Marry elsewhere let them know this from me that they may best expect a Blessing from God when they live in that State where fewest scruples shall arise in their Mind From which whether they shall be free in leaving their old Conjunction and betaking themselves unto a new I refer to their wiser Thoughts when in all probability if any cross or thwart shall arise in their new intended Matrimony this perplexity and anguish will still follow their Souls that they have done that whereof in their truest Meditations they have no ground of Conscience and therefore that it is the Hand of God upon them who giveth not a Blessing unto that which was unduly sought  You have thus at large heard my Opinion against the annullation of this Marriage Now if you ask me what would you then have done concerning this Couple of noble Personages my Answer is that I would have a Reconciliation by all means to be laboured and although that be difficult to bring about yet it is the more Honour when it is effected Charity will forgive and forget the highest Offences It is St  Augustine  's Judgment  That in the greatest Breaches between Man and Wife Reconciliation is the best and the worthiest Pains that can be bestow'd is to bring that about  There wanteth only one or more good Mediators and then great Things will be compassed The disagreement was inconceivable between God and Man yet Christ that great Mediator did take it away The Breach was very bitter between  England  and  Spain  yet our most blessed Soveraign as a gracious Intercessor did give an end unto it Let Divines be used now as much as Lawyers have been used heretofore Take the godly Counsel of the one which will be given freely as you have taken the Advice of the other with much expence of Money This I wish for this I pray for and if my Counsel had been used before Things grew to this height I would have used my best means to have wrought an Atonement But because there is no hope thereof and  this doth expect a legal Decision proceed you that please unto this Separation Give your Sentence in  scriptis  as you have declared your Opinion in  verbis  Five might have served the turn by the Words of the Commission if seven had dissented but you have seven Suffrages and therefore proceed only this I crave of the Register that he do make his Act that this Sentence is given  Joanne Episcopo  London D  Joanne Bennet milite  D  Francisco James  D  Thoma Edwards dissentientibus potissimum verò  Georgio  Archiepiscopo  Cantuariensi  renitente  This is the Substance of that Matter which the Archbishop of  Canterbury  out of certain Notes which he had drawn up was ready to have uttered and no one material Point is added thereunto as appeareth unto me the Writer hereof comparing it with the Notes at such Time as I ended the writing of this which was on the th of  September  three Days after the Time when it should have been spoken  The KING's Letter to the Archbishop of  Canterbury  My Lord  _AFTER I had received and read your Papers which the Bishop of  Litchfield  brought me I found it very necessary that I should make answer thereunto at my first leisure for whereas before at my last meeting with you ye seemed to me to be only as yet unresolved what Sentence to give in this Business till you had heard it throughly disputed that by that means ye might be fully informed of the State of the Cause it appears now by these Papers that you have after your last Days consultation put on a negative Resolution grounded upon Fundaments of Divinity and Conscience as you think which hath mov'd me to send you herewith my Judgment upon your Arguments in regard that I did ever hold it necessary that in a Matter of this Weight all my Commissioners should be as near of one Mind as might be and therefore I would be sorry that your private Conceits  should so blind your Judgment as to make you and your Followers draw the  Perplex or torment  Catharrows against your Yokefellows for that I may now open plainly my Heart unto you at my first reading of your Papers from the Bishop I chance to cast mine Eye first upon the Paper of your Arguments before I had looked upon your Letter and lighting upon your first Words  In as much as we do firmly believe  c I protest I thought it had been some strange Confession of Faith that you had intercepted amongst some of the Sectaries but when I had read out the rest of that first Article God is my Judge I thought that Paper had been some Pasquil made against this Divorce which coming to your hands ye had sent me and therefore without reading any farther therein I looked upon your Letter which resolv'd me of all these Doubts but after that I had fully perused and rightly consider'd of all your Papers I found your Principles so strange and your Doubts so far sought that I thought it necessary as I have already said to set down unto you my Observations upon them But to conclude my Letter with that plainness that becometh one of my Quality I must freely confess that I find the Grounds of your Opposition so weak as I have reason to apprehend that the Prejudice you  have of the Persons is the greatest Motive of breeding these Doubts into you which Prejudice is the most dangerous Thing that can fall in a Judge for misleading of his Mind And the Reason moving me to this Apprehension is partly grounded upon your last Words to me at your parting from  Windsor  and partly upon a Line scrap'd out in your Paper of Doubts for I am sure you think me not so blunt a Secretary but that I can read a Line so scraped out In your last Speeches with me you remember you told me what Assurance you had of the Earl's Ability out of his own Mouth which you said you could not but trust because he was so religious a Nobleman But when I told you of the other Party's contrary Affirmation you remember how you used the Word of Iniquity and how far your interlined Line seems to have a Harmony with this Word your self can best judge Now then if I would ask you what Proof you have of the one's Religion more than the other's you must answer me by judging upon the Exterior and how deceivable that Guess is daily experience teaches us But with a holy Protestation that I never knew any Thing but good in the young Earl Was not this the Ground of Master  Robert Bruse  's Incredulity because he knew the Earl of  Gowry  to be truly Religious and did not beg a Register  Bothwel  in his Preface of his Book  De viris Illustribus  And as for your Judgment of the other Party  Christ's Precept  is the best Answer unto you  nolite judicare  But if the Question were to judge of the Earl's Inclination whether is it likely that you or I could best judge of it I he having been bred with my late Son and serv'd him so long or you that never spoke with him but once or twice in your Life and never knew either good or evil of him but out of his own Mouth I will conclude therefore with inverting the Argument that if a Judge should have a Prejudice in respect of Persons it should become you rather to have a kind of Faith implicit in my Judgment as well in respect of some Skill I have in Divinity as also that I hope no honest Man doubts of the uprightness of my Conscience and the best thankfulness that you that are so far my Creature can use towards me is to reverence and follow my Judgment and not to contradict it except where you may demonstrate unto me that I am mistaken or wrong imformed and so farewel  JAMES R  The LIBEL promoted by the Lady FRANCES HOWARD against ROBERT Earl of  Essex  before the King's Delegates Authorized under the Broad Seal  Ann    Viz  GEORGE Archbishop of  Canterbury    JOHN Bishop of  London    LANCELOT Bishop of  Ely    RICHARD Bishop of  Litchfield  and  Coventry    Sir JULIUS CAESAR LLD  Sir THOMAS PARREY LLD  Sir DANIEL DUNN LLD  JOHN BENNET LLD  FRANCIS JAMES LLD  THOMAS EDWARDS LLD  I _FIRST that She and  Robert  Earl of  Essex  were married by publick Rites and Ceremonies of the Church on the th Day of  January    II That she at that time was full Thirteen Years old and is at this present about Twenty Two or Twenty Three  III That the foresaid  Robert  at the time of the pretended Marriage was about Fourteen Years old and is at this present about Twenty Three or Twenty Four and at that time and ever since and at this present is a Man as far forth as a Man can judge and hath been in good Health and perfect Estate of Body not any way hindred by any  Ague  or Sickness but that he might have carnal Copulation with a Woman  IV That since the pretended Marriage at least by the Space of whole and continuate Three Years after the said  Robert  had fully attained to the Age of Eighteen Years as Time and Place did serve after the fashion of other married Couples the said  Frances Howard  in hope of lawful Issue and that she might be made a Mother lived together with the said  Robert  at Bed and Board and lay both naked and alone in the same Bed as married Folks use and desirous to be made a Mother from time to time again and again yielded her self wholly to his Power and as much as lay in her offer'd her self and her Body  to be known and earnestly sought and desired Conjunction and Copulation  V And also the said Earl in the aforesaid time very often again and again did try to have carnal Copulation as with his lawful Wife which she refused not but used the best Means she could notwithstanding all this the said Earl could never carnally know her nor have that Copulation in any sort which the married Bed alloweth  VI Yet before the said pretended Marriage and since the said Earl hath had and hath Power▪ and Ability of Body to deal with other Women and to know them carnally and sometimes hath felt the Motion and Prick of the Flesh tending to carnal Copulation as he saith and believeth and peradventure truly but by a perpetual and natural Impediment hath been hindred all the former time and is at this present that he can have no Dealing or Copulation with the foresaid Lady  Frances  VII Furthermore the said Lady  Frances  hath been and is a Woman fit and able to have Copulation with a Man and such an one as may be carnally known neither hath in this regard any Impediment  VIII Moreover the said Lady  Frances  remaineth and is at this present a Virgin  IX Besides at the time of the pretended Marriage the said Lady  Frances  was utterly ignorant and unacquainted with the said Earl's Unability and Impediments formerly mentioned  X Also the foresaid Earl long before this Suit commenced hath very often and at sundry times confessed in good Earnest before Witnesses of Credit and his Friends and Kinsfolk that although he did greatly desire and did his best Endeavours yet he never could nor at this present can have carnal Copulation with the said Lady  Frances  no not once  XI Lastly in regard of Womanish Modesty the said Lady  Frances  hath concealed all the former Matters and had a Purpose for ever to conceal them if she had not been forced by false Rumours of her Disobedience to the foresaid Earl to reveal them She requireth that since this pretended Matrimony

Twenty Two and upwards neither since hath had or now hath any Sickness or Impediment to hinder him but that he might have had carnal Knowledge of a Woman save in the time of his Sickness of the  Small Pox  for two or three Years after his Marriage which continued a Month or six Weeks and that at another time when he had some Fits of an  Ague  IV He affirmeth that for one Year he divers times attempted and that the two other Years he did lie in Bed most commonly with her but felt no Motion or Provocation and therefore attempted nothing The first Year when he was willing sometimes she shewed her self ready some other times refused  V He saith he never carnally knew her neither found he any Defect in himself but confesseth that he was not able to penetrate into her Womb nor enjoy her  VI He believeth that before and after the Marriage he hath had an Ability of Body to know any other Woman and hath often times felt Motions and Pricking of the Flesh tending to carnal Copulation but for perpetual and natural Impediments towards the Lady  Frances  he knows not what the Words mean but that he hath lain by her Two or Three Years now last past and had no Motion to have carnal Copulation with her and believeth he never shall  VII He believeth not that the said Lady  Frances  is a Woman apt and fit for carnal Copulation because he hath not found it  VIII IX He believeth to be true  X He believeth that once before some Witnesses of good Credit he did speak to this purpose That he had often times endeavour'd carnally to know her but that he did not nor could not  DOUBTS

per aliquod temporis spatium arbitrio Judicis moderandum  for farther Trial  c  The Lord Archbishop of  Canterbury  's Reasons against the Nullity  IN as much as we do firmly believe that the Scripture directly or by Consequence doth contain in it sufficient Matter to decide all Controversies especially in things appertaining to the Church and that Marriage amongst Christians can be no less accounted than a sacred Thing as being instituted by God in Paradise honoured by the Presence of our Saviour himself declared by St  Paul  to be a Figure of the Spiritual Conjunction between Christ and  his Church I would be glad to know by what Text of Scripture either of the  Old  or  New Testament  a Man may have a Warrant to make a  Nullity  of Marriage solemnly celebrated in  facie Ecclesiae propter maleficium versus hanc  which I do the rather ask because I find Warrant expresly in Scripture to make a Nullity of Marriage  propter frigiditatem  by the Words of our Saviour  Mat    For there are some chast or Eunuchs which were so born of their Mother's Belly and there be some chast which be made chast by Men and there be some chast which have made themselves chast for the Kingdom of Heaven  I would also know gladly what antient Father either amongst the  Greeks  or  Latins  by Occasion of Interpretation of Scripture or any Disputation hath mentioned  Maleficium versus hanc  or declared it to be a Cause of Nullity in Marriage  The like I demand touching the antient Councils either general or provincial and concerning the Stories Ecclesiastical whether any such Matter be to be found in them  If for ought that appeareth never mention was made of this till the time of  Hincmerus Episcopus Rhemensis  who lived Nine Hundred Years after Christ it may well be conceived that this was a Concomitant of Darkness and Popish Superstition which about that time grew to so great an Height  God permitting then the Punishment to fall upon the Children of Unbelief  But since the Light of the Gospel is now in so great Measure broken out again why should I not hope but those who have embraced the Gospel should be free from this  Maleficium  especially since amongst a Million of Men in our Age there is not one found in all our Country who is clearly and evidently known to be troubled with the same And if there should be any that might seem to be thus molested we are taught to use two Remedies against it the one spiritual Physick the other external  For the first our Saviour said  Hoc genus daemoniorum non ejicetur nisi per orationem jejunium  And St  Peter  speaking of the Devil  Cui resistite firmi in fide  And the Canonists themselves prescribe Alms Fasting and Prayer to be used in that Case but that they join superstitiously their Exorcisms thereunto And for corporal Physick to be applied as against a Disease it is the Judgment of our late Divines whether they speak of  Maleficium  or not  Now admit the Earl of  Essex  might be imagined to be troubled with  Maleficium versus hanc  I demand what Alms have been given What fasting hath been used what Prayers have been pour'd out to appease the Indignation of God towards him or his Wife or what Physick hath been taken  or Medicine applied for Eight Years together Not one of these things but the first Hearing must be to pronounce a Nullity in the Marriage Of which Declaration we know

semper amicitia  His Majesty's Answer to the Archbishop's Reasons  TO the first Article that the Scripture directly or by Consequence doth contain sufficient Matter to decide all  Controversies especially in things appertaining to the Church this in my Opinion is  propositio erronea  and one of the Puritan's Grounds without a better Distinction or Explanation For the Orthodox Proposition is That the Scripture doth directly or by Consequence contain in it self sufficient Matter to decide all Controversies in Points of Faith and Salvation of which sort a Nullity in Marriage cannot be accounted for one and therefore your Consequence upon the former Proposition must fail  For farther Satisfaction to your former Question I say your own Second Question doth answer it For if there be a Warrant in Scripture for pronouncing a Nullity  propter frigiditatem  then all the Means which may make him  frigidus versus hanc  must be comprehended therein For why doth our Church justly condemn as incestuous the Marriage of a Man with his Sister's Daughter or the Marriage of Two Sisters but  à Paritate Rationis  for none of them is in  terminis  prohibited by the Scripture only the Conclusion is gather'd  à Paritate Rationis  For if it be not lawful to marry your Father's Wife because thereby you discover your Father's Shame nor his Sister because she is his Kinswoman nor your own Sister because thereby you discover your Father and Mother's Shame  It can no more be lawful to marry your Sister's Daughter for thereby you also discover your own Shame As also that the same Reason serves for ascending or descending in Points of Consanguinity  quia par est Ratio  The like is in this Case for altho' Christ spake only of three sorts of Eunuchs yet  ratio est quia non potest esse copula inter Eunuchum mulierem  and therefore St  Paul  in the th of the  Corinthians  telleth us clearly that it is no  Conjunction sine copula  I conclude therefore  à paritate rationis  that Christ did comprehend under those three sorts of Eunuchs all Inability which did perpetually hinder  Copulam versus hanc  whether it were natural or accidental For what Difference is there betwixt cutting off of the Hand and being made impotent thereof  Amputatio mutulatio Membri  is all one in the Civil Law and it is alike defrauding of the Woman when either he who is to be her Husband is gelded or when the Use of that Member towards her is by any unlawful Means taken from him Neither is it any way needful to crave the particular Warrant of Nullity  propter Maleficium  out of the Scripture no more than there is Warrant in that Place for any Nullity at all For Christ doth not directly say that a Marriage so made shall be null neither doth he teach us what Form of Process shall  be used in it neither maketh he mention of a triennial Probation no more than he forbiddeth Marriage within the Fourth Degree without Leave obtained of the Bishop of the Diocess It is therefore sufficient to all moderate Christians to be taught out of the Word that Marriage is null  sine Copula  and that the Word  Quos Deus conjunxit  is never found in the Scripture where  erunt  doth not precede  viz they shall be one Flesh  But whether the Impediment be universal or  versus hanc  only and whether the Fault thereof have been born with him or done to him by Violence or fallen by Disease or by Disproportion or Ineptitude betwixt the Parties or by unlawful or unnatural Practices it is ever  par ratio  He is  Eunuchus versus hanc  for he ought to be  Eunuchus versus omnes alias  seeing to her only he was married and therefore  à Paritate Rationis  such Nullities are grounded upon the aforesaid Warrant of Scripture neither had Christ then any Occasion to speak to the  Jews  concerning  Maleficium  for as it is apparent that God made King  Abimelech  and his Family unable to abuse  Sarah    Abraham  's Wife and so was he made by God himself  Eunuchus versus hanc  is it not improbable that the Devil being God's Ape should imitate God's Work by his filthy Witchcraft by making such as God  will permit him  inhabile versus hanc  tho' it may be that it was long after that time before the Devil put that Trick in use upon the Earth  As to your Third and Fourth Questions What mention the Fathers and Councils make of  Maleficium versus hanc  First I answer That it may be if they be well searched that either something to this purpose shall be found in them or at least  aliquid analogum  which  à paritate rationis  or by Consequence may serve to decide this Question But leaving this to the Search my main Answer is That we must distinguish of Times For in all the first Ages as long as Persecution lay heavy upon the Church and before that the Emperors became Christians the Church did not meddle with Questions of Marriage for the Civil Judges determined them who would not suffer the Church to meddle with any thing which drew a Consequence after it of Possessions and Inheritance as Marriage doth Nay even divers hundred Years after the Conversion of the Emperors the Judgment and Decisions of all such Questions did still remain in  foro Civili  till the Popedom began to wax great and assume or rather usurp to her self a Power of Supreme or Independent Judicatory in all Ecclesiastical Causes And therefore the Fathers and Councils  had no Occasion to make mention of that which was not  eorum fori  at that time And besides that it is an evil Argument to say that such a thing is unlawful because the Fathers and first Councils make no mention of it For you know much beter than I that divers main Points in Controversy betwixt the Papists and us are never mention'd by the Fathers because they could never have dreamt that such Questions would arise and therefore we only find the Fathers exact in such Questions as were most agitated and upon the Stage in their time as  de Trinitate de duabus in Christo Naturis  and such like It is therefore sufficient that there can be nothing found in them which may be justly understood to contradict this Opinion and it is very probable as I said before that this Trick of  Maleficium  had not then been put in Practice in the World and therefore not known nor mentioned by them for why may not the Devil find out as well new Tricks of Witchcraft when God will permit him as he doth daily new sorts of Heresies for his Malice can never end till the End of Times  To your Fifth Argument my former Answer doth also serve For till the Nine Hundredth Year of God it may be that that devilish Trick came never to be discovered and you know the old Proverb  Ex malis moribus bonae leges  and it is not unlikely that that Time of Darkness gave the Devil occasion of devising of such new Tricks Look my  Demonology  and yet was that Law for which you cite  Hincmarus Episcopus Rhemensis  made by  Charles the Great  who in many great Points as you know had so great Light as I dare scarcely term his Time a Time of Blindness But how great and palpable soever that Darkness was in Points of Superstition I will still maintain it as I have ever done that for Matter of Order and Policy all the World shall never be able to find out any other so good and so old an Order of Government to be put in the place of it In sign whereof there is no well governed Commonwealth in the Christian World where the Canon Law is not received to judge in Questions of that Nature and it is certain that this Question in hand is only a Question of Order and Policy for the Grounds of this Question  That the essential Point of Matrimony cannot be accomplished sine Copula  is warranted by express Scripture and confessed by your self  To your Sixth Argument or rather Hope I fear that Hope shall prove contrary to Faith For as sure as God is there be Devils and Devils must have some Power and their Power is in this World for  Satan  is the Prince of this World  Neither are the Elect exempted from his Power  Job  was not St  Paul  was not Christ saith to all his Disciples  Cribravit vos Satanas  And if the Devil hath any Power over the Elect it is over their Flesh and if over the Flesh rather over the fleshest and most sinful part thereof whereunto original Sin is so tyed as God both before and under the Law to shew the difficulty of purging Mans original Sin ordained the amputation of the Foreskin of that Member And to exempt those of our Profession from the Power of Witchcraft is a Paradox never yet maintained by any Learned or Wise Man That the Devils Power is not so universally unbridled amongst us that I freely confess but that it is totally restrained  quoad nos  how then was a Minister of  Geneva  bewitched to Death And how are the Witches daily punished by our Laws Surely if they can harm none but the Papists we are too Charitable to labour for avenging them only  Satan  is permitted to punish Man as well for the breach of the Second as the First Table and thereof are we no less Guilty than the Papists are And if the Power of Witchcraft may reach to our Life how much more to a Member especially to a Member so governed by the Fantasie wherein the Devil hath his principal Operation and he may so estrange the Husband's  Affection from the Wife as he cannot be able to perform that Duty unto her For it is a common Thing in many Mens Nature that they cannot do that Act but where they Love nor Fight but when they are Angry God keep us therefore from putting the Trial of our Profession upon Miracles let the Miraclemongers live by their own Trade  To your Seventh Argument touching the Remedies what do you know whether both Parties or either of them have used both those Remedies or not And that that spiritual Remedy of Fasting and Prayer should be used publickly for them I can see no necessity For  non interest Reipublicae nec Ecclesiae  And private Persons are commanded to use their Fasting and Alms secretly and in private besides that no such Remedy or Cure is likely to succeed well except the Parties own Heart and Desire be set upon it  And as for your Conclusion upon the  incommodum  either in these Persons or in the Example I can see none in either for as to this Couple betwixt whom Marriage was never truly accomplished they will peradventure both of them by the declaratory of this Nullity be made capable to accomplish lawful Marriage with others which they could not do betwixt themselves wherein they may live to the satisfaction  of their Hearts and enjoy the Blessing of Procreation of Children And as to the Example the Law shall be fulfilled by due Administration of Justice which cannot serve for an Example or President of counterfeited Nullites in Time to come for  Notoritas facti  or rather  non facti  is  luce clariorie  in this Case Besides the many legal Probations and Confessions of the Parties which have been taken in this Process whereas by the contrary if they shall be forcibly kept together their Names or shadows may well be kept together but never their Persons or Affections and they shall be forced to live either in perpetual Misery and Scandal or both And what such a forced Continency can avail the Monks Continency can teach us And for a President in time to come it can reach no further than to open a way of lawful Relief for any Parties who shall chance to be distressed in that sort  Hac est mea sententia  And as for the Extract of our late Divines Opinions upon this Question I confess I cannot guess what your intent was in sending them unto me for they all agree in  Terminis  with my Opinion that there is such a Thing as  Maleficiati versus hanc  and your very interlined Passages prove it clearliest As for their Advice concerning the Remedies that is  Consilium  non jus nec Decretum  not imposing a necessity but is to be used by discretion as occasion shall serve or require it  As for the legal Doubts of formality they concern none of your Calling If your Conscience be resolved in the Points of Divinity it is your part to give your consent to the Nullity and let the Lawyers take the burthen of making it formal  And as for the triennial Probation I hope no Man can be so blind as to make a double triennial both  Ante post litem contestatam  And in Conclusion our new Divines Solution of this Question proveth clearly that their Resolution upon this Doubt howsoever it was first conceiv'd in blindness as you think yet is it now approved in the time of the greatest Light and Purity of the Profession of the Gospel  To conclude then if this may satisfy your Doubts I will end with our Saviour's Words to St  Peter    Et cum conversus eris confirma fratres tuos  But I must add  vel si opus fuerit converte fratres tuos  For on my Conscience all the Doubts I have yet seen made in this Business are nothing but  Nodos in Scirpo quaerere  The Midwives appointed to make Inspection upon the Lady's Body gave in that the Lady  Essex  is a Woman apt to have Copulation and to bring forth Children and  that the said Lady is a Virgin and uncorrupted  Three Ladies affirm That they believe the same for that they were present when the Midwives made the Inspection and did see them give good Reasons for it  After these Matters were summed up there was a Sentence of Divorce given for the Nullity of the Marriage and both Parties licensed to be married again  The Commissioners who gave Sentence in the Lady  Essex  's behalf were  Bishops  Winchester    Ely    Litchfield  and  Coventry    Rochester    Doctors of Law  Sir  Julius Caesar    Sir  Thomas Parry    Sir  Daniel Dun    The Commissioners Dissenting  Archbishop of  Canterbury    Bishop of  London  Doctors of Law  Sir  John Bennet    Francis James    Thomas Edwards    The Copy of the Divorce drawn up in this Form which followeth  IT is by these Presents declared That whereas  Robert  Earl of  Essex  and the Lady  Frances Howard  Contracted by shew of Marriage did Cohabit in one House and lie together in one Bed  Nudus cum Nuda  and  Solus cum Sola  and that the said Lady  Frances  did shew her self prompt ready to be known of him and that the said Earl neither did nor could have Knowledge of her although he did think himself able to have Knowledge of other Women And that the said Lady  Frances  by inspection of her Body by Midwives expert in matter of Marriage was prov'd to be apt for carnal Copulation with Man and yet a Virgin Therefore we the said Judges deputed in the Cause first invocating the Name of  Christ  and setting God before our Eyes do Pronounce Decree and Declare That the Earl of  Essex  for some secret incurable binding Impediment did never carnally know or was or is able carnally to know the Lady  Frances Howard  and therefore we do Pronounce have Decreed and do Declare the pretended Marriage so Contracted and Solemniz'd  de Facto  between them to have been and to be utterly void and to no effect and that they did want and ought to want the Strength of the Law and that the Lady  Frances  was and is and so ought to be free and at Liberty from any Bond of such pretended Marriage  de facto  Contracted and Solemniz'd And we do pronounce That she ought to be Divorced and so we do Free and Divorce her leaving them as touching other Marriages to their Conscience in the Lord Which our Definitive Sentence and Decree we here Ratify and Publish  Bishops  Winchester    Ely

An Account of the Intrigue between ROBERT CAR Earl of  Somerset  Viscount  Rochester  c and the Lady FRANCES HOWARD  An Reg    An Christi    By ARTHUR WILSON  Esq  _AMONG all our Historians Mr  Wilson  in his Life of King JAMES the First relates this Affair with the most exactness and  See the Notes upon King  James  's Reign in the Collection of the History of  England  Vol pag  As he has given us a more full and particular Account of these Passages between the Earl of  ESSEX  his Lady and the Favourite  CAR  so he was best qualified to do it being an intimate Bosom Acquaintance of the Earl from his Youth to his Death But if any unusual Warmth be observed in his manner of relating them it must be attributed to his Zeal for the Honour of his Patron  Having thus given the Motives that might in some Measure sway Mr WILSON in the Earl's behalf I shall now produce his own Words leaving the whole to the Reader's Judgment  The Treasurer  See Mr  Wilson  's History of King  James I  pag  seq  CECIL Earl of  Salisbury  that great Engine of the State by whom all Wheels moved held an intimate Correspondence with the House of  Suffolk  which he had strengthned with an Alliance marrying his eldest Son the Lord  Cranborn  to  Katharine  the eldest Daughter of that Family And being mindful of the Asperity and Sharpness that was betwixt him and the late Earl of  Essex  he thought it a good Act of Policy and Piety not to suffer Malice to become Hereditary and therefore he was a great Means in marrying the young Earl of  Essex  to the Lady  Frances Howard  another of those Sisters that the Father's Enmity might be closed up by the Son's  Nuptial Fraternity The Earl of  Essex  was Fourteen Years of Age and she Thirteen when they married too young to consider but old enough to consent Yet by the Advice of Friends separated after Marriage she under her Mother's Wing and he visiting  France  and  Germany  till Time should mature and ripen a happy Counion The Court was her Nest her Father being Lord Chamberlain and she was hatch'd up by her Mother whom the sowr Breath of that Age how justly I know not had already tainted from whom the young Lady might take such a Tincture that Ease Greatness and Court Glories would more distain and impress on her than any way wear out and diminish And growing to be a Beauty of the greatest Magnitude in that Horizon was an Object fit for Admirers and every Tongue grew an Orator at that Shrine  The Prince of  Wales  now in his Puberty sent many loving Glances as Ambassadors of his good Respects and amorous Expressions are fit Subjects for jealous Reproaches to work on Her Husband having been now Three or Four Years beyond the Seas sick with Absence from her whom his Desires longed after came over again and found that Beauty which he had left Innocent so faded and sophisticated  with some Court Drug which had wrought upon her that he became the greatest Stranger at home His Patience made way for him a while and he bore up with a gentle Gale against the Stream of this Woman's Affections which ran altogether unknown to him into another Channel Nor was her Reputation yet become so robust being of a tender Growth to strike his Ears with Reproaches and therefore he imputed her sly Entertainments to a Maiden bashfulness till surfeited with that dull Potion upon better Advice he went to the Earl of  Suffolk  her Father and demanded his Wife thinking himself capable to enjoy both her and her Love The Father that thought there had been an Intimacy betwixt them suitable to their Conjugal Knot made use of his Paternal Power to reduce his Daughter to the Obedience of a Wife But while these Things were struggling for a most violent Disease of a poysonous Nature imputed to but far transcending the SmallPox seized on the Earl of  Essex  and had not the Strength of Youth and that Almighty Power that orders all things wrought out the Venom of it the Earth as probable wish'd by her had been his MarriageBed  For this Lady being taken with the growing Fortunes of ROBERT CAR Viscount  Rochester  and grounding more Hope upon him than the uncertain and hopeless Love of the Prince she cast her Anchor there which the Prince soon discover'd and slighted her accordingly For dancing one time among the Ladies and her Glove falling down it was taken up and presented to him by one that thought he did him acceptable Service but the Prince refus'd to receive it saying publickly He would not have it it is stretcht by another meaning the Viscount This was an Aggravation of Hatred betwixt the King's Son and the King's Friend  The Countess of  Essex  having her Heart alienated from her Husband and set upon the Viscount had a double Task to undergo for accomplishing her Ends One was to hinder her Husband from enjoying her the other was to make the Viscount sure unto her For dishonest Love is most full of Jealousy Her Husband she look'd upon as a private Person and to be carried by him into the Country out of her Element being Ambitious of Glory and a Beauty covetous of Applause were to close as she thought with an insufferable Torment though he was a Man that did not only every way  merit her Love but he lov'd her with an extraordinary Affection having a gentle mild and courteous Disposition especially to Women such as might win upon the roughest Natures But this fiery Heat of his Wife's mounted upon the Wings of Lust or Love call it what you will carried her after so much Mischief that those that saw her Face might challenge Nature of too much Hypocrisy for harbouring so wicked a Heart under so sweet and bewitching a Countenance  To strengthen her Designs she finds out one of her own Stamp Mrs  Turner  a Doctor of Physick's Widow a Woman whom Prodigality and Loosness had brought low yet her Pride would make her fly any Pitch rather than fall into the Jaws of Want These two consult together how they may stop the Current of the Earl's Affection towards his Wife and make a clear Passage for the Viscount in the Place To effect which one Doctor  Forman  a reputed Conjurer living at  Lambeth  is found out The Women declare to him their Grievances he promises sudden Help and to amuse them frames many little Pictures of Brass and Wax some like the Viscount and Countess whom he must unite and strengthen others like the Earl of  Essex  whom he  must debilitate and weaken and then with Philtrous Powders and such Drugs he works upon their Persons And to practise what Effects his Art would produce Mrs  Turner  that lov'd Sir  Arthur Manwaring  a Gentleman then attending the Prince and willing to keep him to her gave him some of the Powder which wrought so violently with him that through a Storm of Rain and Thunder he rode Fifteen Miles one dark Night to her House scarce knowing where he was till he was there  Such is the Devilish and mad Rage of Lust heighten'd with Art and Fancy  These Things matur'd and ripen'd by the Cunning of this Jugler  Forman  gave them Assurance of happy Hopes Her Courtly Invitements that drew the Viscount to observe her she imputed to the Operation of those Drugs he had tasted and that Harshness and stubborn Comportment she expressed to her Husband making him weary of such Entertainments to absent himself she thought proceeded from the Effects of those unknown Potions and Powders that were administred to him So apt is the Imagination to take Impression of those Things we are willing to believe  The good Earl finding his Wife noussed in the Court and seeing no Possibility to  reduce her to Reason till she were estranged from the Relish and Taste of the Delights she suck'd in there made his Condition again known to her Father The old Man being troubled with his Daughter's Disobedience imbitter'd her being near him with wearisome and continual Chidings to wean her from the Sweets she doted on and with much ado forc'd her into the Country But how harsh was the parting being rent away from the Place where she grew and flourish'd Yet she left all her Engines and Imps behind her the old Doctor and his Confederate Mrs  Turner  must be her two Supporters She blazons all her Miseries to them at her departure and moistens the Way with her Tears  Chartley  was an hundred Miles from her Happiness and a little time thus lost is her Eternity When she came thither tho' in the pleasantest time of Summer she shut her self up in her Chamber not suffering a Beam of Light to peep upon her dark Thoughts If she stir'd out of her Chamber it was in the Dead of Night when Sleep had taken Possession of all others but those about her In this implacable sad discontented Humour she continued some Months always murmuring against but never giving the least civil Respect to her Husband which the  good Man suffer'd patiently being loath to be the Divulger of his own Misery Yet having a Manly Courage he would sometimes break into a little Passion to see himself slighted and neglected by himself but having never found better from her it was the easier to bear with her  While she was at  Chartley  she writ to her Confederates That  her Husband found little Operation in their Drugs complaining of his Lustiness and her Misery For  she said  the Viscount would never love her if her Husband did meddle with her which with Difficulty she yet impeded but how long she should resist his Violence she knew not therefore she implor'd their Assistance if they would not see her the most despicable Creature in the World And for Satisfaction they should make their own Price  With this kind of Stuff she fill'd her Letters which were after found in  Forman  's Closet These Instigations made him active and the Man being skilful in Natural Magick did use all the Artifice his Subtilty could devise really to imbecilitate the Earl for no Linnen came near his Body that was not rinsed with their Camphire Compositions and other faint and wasting Ingredients and all inward Applications were foisted on him by corrupted Servants to lessen and debilitate the Seminal Operations which  Veneficium  is one great part of Witchcraft destructive to Nature and horribly abominable to be practised And this in time wrought such Effects upon his Person that he found himself unable with her tho' she permitted him yet when he had been from her some reasonable time to renovate his Spirits by shaking off those Artificial Applications then his Abilities made her unwilling and refractory Tho' some are of Opinion that he was not much debilitated but that she got by her virtuous Agents an Artifice too immodest to be express'd to hinder Penetration And thus she tormented him till he was contented to let her steer her own Course which after run her on Ground  For coming to  London  next Winter with this full Sail loaden with Lust she found the Viscount much prepar'd for her who being at first fasten'd on the Object Absence and all those little Artifices that mischievous Women and cunning Impostures could devise had advanced him as much in his Desires as they had hindred the other We could dispute the Nature of these Operations how far they are contingent and how the Fancy works with them tho' ignorant of them making their Impulsions more active being the Sparks that kindle  this combustible Matter for we will never allow there was any other Diabolical Means used Nature being strong eenough for such a Production but being not pertinent to the Story will leave it and follow them that found the Effects of it and had Affections suitable to it which they made use of with an unbridled Appetite yet meeting closely in Corners Sin being at first shamefac'd but afterwards they grew more bold and every Hour that the Viscount could steal from his Royal Master he dedicated it to his disloyal Mistress Being caught in this Net of Adulation he becomes a willing Prisoner Lust only getting Liberty to all Looseness and Licentiousness Places of frequent Meetings are daily renew'd Persons fitted for such Practices are employ'd and when Nature was exhausted Art her subtle Imitator brought in her Store to contribute new Spirits purchased at any rate All outward Adornment to present Beauty in her full Glory were not wanting on both sides being Lust's Fuel which tended to the Consumption of all Reason And among the rest yellow Starch the Invention and foil of Jaundice Complexions with great cutwork Bands and Piccadillies a thing that hath since lost the Name crouded in and flourish'd among us Mrs  Turner  being nominated to be the first Contriver happily in  England  but the Original came out from  France  which Fashion and Colour did set off their lean and sallow Countenances Thus did the Viscount get the Conquest of two the King and this Lady but could not subdue his own lustful Appetite  However the King's Affections were not so monopoliz'd but that his crafty Servant the Earl of  Salisbury  had a good Hole as well in his Councils as Treasure And being not well pleas'd to see himself bearded by a Youth new started into the Affairs of the World and mounted by the Wing of Love not of Merit he cast out many Mists before him to hinder and damp his Passage so that the Viscount could not rise to that Pitch during his Life that he afterwards arriv'd at  On the th Day of  November  Death depriv'd us of the King's eldest Son Prince  Henry  a Prince as eminent in Nobleness as in Blood and having a Spirit too full of Life and Splendor to be long shrouded in a Cloud of Flesh  Anno  The Viscount  Rochester  all this while tho' plung'd in Lust was held up by the Chin in the Glories of the Court and the Prince that interposed betwixt him and the Beams of Majesty  being remov'd the Earl of  Salisbury  another Obstacle dying Six Months after the Prince in the Way from the  Bath  he now took full Possession of the King's Favours alone He executes the Place of Principal Secretary receiving all Pacquets and dispatching Answers without the Knowledge of the King or Council or if the King did know his Love had hoarded up such a Confidence in him as he laid all out upon that Stock  Rochester  's greatest Assistant was a private Gentleman one Sir  Thomas Overbury  by whose Compass he steer'd his Course who being a Man of Parts and Abilities had wrought upon the Viscount so as not only to keep him in and close with the King but to make him capable of managing the highest Affairs if he had kept himself within the Circle drawn to his Hand This Intimacy betwixt them spake  Overbury  an Actor in all his Privacies And when he understood by the Viscount his Intention of Marriage with the Countess of  Essex  he oppos'd it with all the powerful Arguments he could use For tho' he might be so active in his Initiation of Favour with the Viscount to be Assistant to his Pleasures and for carrying forward some of his dark Contrivances those Secretaries being always the greatest Favourites  yet having now gotten good footing in his Affection and building his Fortune thereon his Reason might tell him there could be nothing more destructive to both their growing Hopes than to lay a Foundation upon so much publick Injustice as to marry another Man's Wife her Husband living therefore he passionately perswaded him to cast his Thoughts upon a more honourable Object and not one whose Disloyalty in her present Condition was so much branded with Infamy that the Marks of it would be visible on his Face But the Viscount bewitched with the Enticements of his Soulravishing Mistress uncapable of good Counsel doth not only call home his Affections from  Overbury  that had been long Leiger with him denouncing Enmity but incites his Beloved against him also who mustering up all her Passions with the greatest Acrimony that a Feminine Malice could devise she never left till she had discharg'd all the Vollies of her Rage upon him And the better to do it she consults with her Uncle the Earl of  Northampton  aggravating  Overbury  's Offence as tending to the Dishonour of their whole Family That he a petty Fellow should dare to raise such Scandals against her Innocency The Earl of  Northampton    that knew of the Endearments betwixt the Viscount and his Niece so base and mercenary was his Spirit thought it good Policy to stop all Passages that it might not come into the publick Mouth For being in a Sphere elated above others it was a Sin of a high Presumption for any of an inferior Orb to move but in its own Place or meddle with what is above them He therefore closes with the Viscount whom in his flattering Acclamations by Letters he makes a little Deity and after some Dispute of the manner how to be revenged of  Overbury  they conclude to dispatch him by Poison which could not be done so well in a publick way and therefore they subtilly contrive to exasperate the King against him that being a Prisoner and shackled by them to a Place he might be a more settled Mark for their envenom'd Arrows  About the same time the King thinking fit to send an Ambassador into  Flanders  to the ArchDuke some say into  France  the Viscount recommended Sir  Thomas Overbury  to the King for that Service extolling his Abilities and Fitness for the same publickly that more Notice might be taken of the Affront and the King made choice of him for that Employment Which done the Viscount  under the Shadow of Friendship imparts to  Overbury  what Intentions the King had towards him but he thought it would not be so convenient for him to accept of it because he should not only lose his Converse and Company by such an Alienation which he highly valued but many a fair Opportunity of improving his Respects to him in some better way of Advancement  Overbury  had not been so little a Courtier or a Man of so mean Reason but that he was sensible what Displeasure he should pull upon himself by refusing the King's Commands And therefore he told the Viscount that betwixt the King's Favours and his Friendship he had a great Conflict in his Spirit being willing to retain both but how he should refuse the King's Commands with Safety he knew not But the Viscount with fair Promises prevail'd with him to set up his Rest at home upon higher Expectation such a sweet Bait is Ambition protesting to take off the Asperity of the King's Anger from him and smooth his Way so as should be for his better Advantage When he had wrought  Overbury  in this Forge he goes to the King and blows the Fire incensing him with all the Aggravations he could so that the poor Gentleman for his Contempt  was forthwith committed to the  Tower  And to prepare all things for his Reception there Sir  William Wade  the late Lieutenant was remov'd and Sir  Jervis Ellowis  a Person more ambitious than indigent having made his Way by Mony the common Merit was admitted to the Place  Now the Countess like another  Alecto  drove furiously her Chariot having two Wheels which ran over all Impediments One was to sue a Divorce betwixt her and her Husband that she might marry the Viscount The other was to take away  Overbury  the Blemish in her Eye and that laid such a Stain upon her that nothing but his Blood could expiate For these she hath several Engines the one must be acted Overtly the other Covertly in dark Corners and she and her Agents find fit Ministers for both  The Earl of  Northampton  resenting his Nieces Grievances makes the King acquainted with her Maiden Bashfulness how loth she is to divulge her Husband's Infirmities and how long it is since her Marriage and yet she hath not enjoyed the Happiness of a Wife that her Husband's Inability must needs be an unnatural Conjunction such as neither Law nor Reason can admit of and that there  was a great Affection betwixt the Viscount and her so as there seem'd to be a more excellent Sympathy and sweet Composition of Soul in them more suitable to Reason and Nature than in the State she was in Which was seconded by the Viscount's humble Submissions to the King's great Wisdom who he acknowledg'd had not only raised him to what he is but may yet make him more happy by uniting him to a Lady of so much Honour and Virtue  The King that took Delight to compleat the Happiness of them he lov'd commanded the Bishops to sue out a Divorce between the Earl of  Essex  and his Lady that the Viscount might marry her For he had been practis'd formerly in  Scotland  in his Minority with the like Experiment  Elizabeth  Daughter to the Earl of  Athol  being married to the Earl of  March  under pretence of Impotency but merely for Lust as the  Vid  Johnston  's Hist of  Scotland  Author reports was Divorced from her Husband and married to the Earl of  Arran  the King's Favourite who had been before a Partner in her Adulterous Sheets so current is the Parrallel and so equally are Lust and Ambition yoked together that they both  with full Violence draw one and the same Way  The Bishops and others having a Commission under the Great Seal of  England  to convene the Earl of  Essex  and his Countess before them sent out their Summons and they made their Appearance accordingly But before they proceeded they caused a Jury of Twelve discreet Matrons to be impanell'd to search the Countess whether she were as she pretended to be and was reputed a Maid still for if she were a Maid they could fasten upon a Nullity and so separate them for the more Honour of her Virginity The Countess being asham'd and bashful to come to such a Trial would not expose her Face to the Light but being to appear before the Matrons under a Veil another  Said to be one of Sir  Thomas Monson  's Daughters for the Countess was reported to have had a Child in the Earl's Absence  young Gentlewoman that had less offended was fobbed into the Place and she passed in the Opinion both of Jury and Judges to be a Virgin  These Bishops and the rest of the Judges could not be ignorant what scandalous Reports of this Lady's Actions flew up and down from Lip to Lip  which however sweeten'd by the Partakers carried an ill Savour with them in every honest Understanding who were not blinded with Wilfulness or deafned with Prejudice which made the Bishops of  Canterbury  and  London  decline the Business though nominated in the Patent But Kings will never want fit Ministers in corrupted Times both in Church and Commonwealth as long as there are degrees and Places of Ascent to clime to And though these Things floated a while upon the Streams of Greatness yet there is one above that moves the Waters who did not only see what pass'd in the Bishop's Palace but in the closest Prison which he discover'd to the Shame and Ruin of the Actors  The Countess's Attempts against the Earl by Sorcery  THE Earl of  Essex  being a Gentleman of the fairest Character and universally belov'd he out of the natural sweetness of his Temper took frequent Occasions of admonishing his Lady against those Evils which common fame loaded her with But she being averse towards him and persuing with all her might the bent of her lascivious  Inclinations was deaf to his kind Intreaties and privately conspir'd his Destruction after the following manner  She became acquainted with one Mrs  Turner  a Woman of a vicious Character from her Youth and who encouraged her in her wicked Purposes against the Earl by consenting to Poison him which they attempted but their execrable Design not taking effect the Countess writ thus to Mrs  Turner  Sweet  Turner    AS thou hast been hitherto so art thou all my Hopes of Good in this World My Lord is as lusty as ever he was and has complain'd to my Brother  Howard  that he hath not lain with me nor us'd me as his Wife this makes me Mad since of all Men I loath him as the only obstacle and hindrance that I shall never enjoy him whom I love  Yours c FRANCES ESSEX  The Earl having escaped this Plot the hatred of the Countess still increas'd towards him and drew her headlong into her own Destruction He perceiving himself less regarded gives her fresh Advice endeavouring if possible to reclaim her which she not in the least regarded but  grew more enrag'd and in a great Fury she takes her Coach and repairs to Mrs  Turner  who was ready to assist in any evil Act accordingly they repaired to one Dr  Forman  at  Lambeth  who was skill'd in the Magic Art him they fee'd to join with them who tried many Devices to bewitch the Earl all which failing at last they framed a waxen Image and got a Thorn from a Tree that bore Leaves and stuck them upon the  Privities  of the said Image by which means they accomplished their desire  This being done according to her expectation she repairs to her House at  Chartley  and thither the  Earl  comes to her But whether the  Earl  was more lusty than she expected or what other accident happened it is unknown Nevertheless she grew jealous of her Acts and falls into a great Fear that all their Labour was lost whereupon she wrote a Letter to Dr  Forman  to this effect  viz  Sweet Father  ALthough I found you ready at all Times to further me yet must I still crave your help wherefore I beseech you that you keep the Doors close and that you still retain the Lord with me and his Affection towards me I have no cause but to be confident in you although the World be against me yet Heaven fails me not many are the troubles I sustain the doggedness  of my Lord the crossness of mine Enemies and the subversions of my Fortunes unless you by your Wisdom do deliver me out of the midst of this Wilderness which I intreat for God's sake  From  Chartley    Your Affectionote  Daughter  FRANCES ESSEX  This Letter coming to the Hands of the old Master procures a new attempt and now he goes and inchants a Nutmeg and a Letter one to be given the Viscount in his Drink the other to be sent to him as a Present these Things being accomplished he not long after died leaving behind him some of those Letters whereby the Countess had intercourse with him in his Pocket which gave some light into the Business amongst which this aforesaid Letter was one  Dr  Forman  being dead Mrs  Turner  wanted one to assist her whereupon at the Countess's coming to  London  one  Gresham  was nominated to be entertained in this Business and in process of time was wholly interested in it  The Countess upon her return sends Gratulations to the Viscount and with  those the Letter sent her by Dr  Forman  he reads it and the more he reads it the more he is entangled for no Man knows the Mysteries that are contain'd in Evil Arts and who can withstand the Mischiefs that are in evil Tongues Whereupon he returns Answer and new Places of meeting are assign'd amongst the rest one at  Hammersmith  in the mean Time the Viscount makes dispatch of his Business leaves Things half done half undone to the intent he might meet her who had there stay'd for his coming above Two Hours and being met they solemnly saluted each other fell into divers Discourses and insinuating  Phrases  from  Words  to  Deeds  and from  speaking  to  acting  the Sin of Venery  The Countess having obtained that she desired and the Viscount caught in the Net of Adulation the more he striveth to be loose is caught the faster so that Lust having by this means got liberty being covered with Greatness like a Fire concealed in a pile of rotten Wood burst forth in all loosness and licentiousness Places of more frequent and private Meetings are concluded upon between them Persons fitting for their Purposes being acquainted with their Proceedings watchwords are given all Things having relation to a certain end make them the  bolder  and more safely to accomplish that which both Time and Memory  cannot demonstrate in former Histories now these good Parts which seemed heretofore to be hopeful in the Viscount consume to Cinders and the Corruption remains to brand him in the Forehead for his  evil living  his Modesty becomes eclipsed his Behaviour light his Carriage unseemly in his Place nothing so costly no Attire so uncouth but at all Costs and Charges he obtains it for the increase of Favour new Fashions are produced that so he might shew more beautiful and fair and that his favour and personage might be made manifest to the World and to this purpose  yellow Bands dusted Hair curled crisped frisled slicked Skins open'd Breasts  beyond accustomed  modesty  with many other inordinate  Attires  were worn on both sides to the shew of the World so that for the increase of dishonest Appetites they were abundantly practised surfeiting thus upon their  Pleasure  having been before accustomed unto hardiness causeth him to fall into all manner of forgetfulness letting all Things go to wrack careless in  Attendance  neglecting  State Affairs  ignorant of his own Worth subjecting himself to the lustful Appetite of an evil Woman accounting no Time well spent nor Hour deem'd so happy as when  dalliance  and pleasant Discourses pass between them either in Words or Writing  Time could no longer conceal these secret Meetings but at length the Marriage of the Viscount and Countess were brought to light which when made publick every one declaimed against her but extoll'd the Earl of  Essex  however an Order was forthwith sent to him to repay her Portion of  l  to do which he was forced to sell part of his Estate thereunto willingly consenting that he might get rid of her The King nevertheless continues his Favour to the Viscount and install'd him Earl of  Somerset  But at last the joint Wickedness of all these Accomplices broke out in the Murder of  Overbury  upon which occasion the following Letters found in Dr  Forman  's Closet after his Death were produc'd in Court at Mrs  Turner  's Arraignment by the Doctor's Widow  The Countess's LETTER to Mrs  Turner  to procure an Inchantment for turning the Viscount's Affections towards her  Sweet  Turner    I Am out of all hope of any good in this World for my Father my Mother and my Brother said I should lie with him and my Brother  Howard  was here and said he would not come from this Place all Winter so that  all comfort is gone and which is worst of all my Lord hath complained that he hath not lain with me and I would not suffer him to use me my Father and Mother are angry but I had rather die a thousand Times over for besides the Sufferings I shall lose his Love if I lie with him I will never desire to see his Face and if my Lord do that unto me my Lord is very well as ever he was so as you may see in what a miserable Case I am you must send the Party word of all he sent me word all should be well but I shall not be so happy as the Lord to love me As you have taken pains all this while for me so now do all you can for never so unnappy as now for I am not able to endure the Miseries that are coming to me but I cannot be happy so long as this Man liveth therefore pray for me for I have need but I should be better if I had your Company to ease my Mind let him know this all News if I can get this done you shall have as much Money as you can demand this is  fair play  Your Sister FRANCES ESSEX  Burn this Letter  A Letter from the Countess to Dr  Forman  Sweet Father  I Must still crave your Love although I hope I have it and shall deserve it better hereafter  remember the Galls for I fear tho' I have yet no cause but to be confident in you yet I desire to have it as it is yet remaining well so continue it still if it be possible and if you can you must send me some good Fortune alas I have need of it keep the Lord still to me for that I desire and be careful you name me not to any body for we have so many Spies that you must use all your Wits and all little enough for the World is against me and the Heavens favour me not Only happy in your Love I hope you will do me good and if I be ungrateful let all mischief come unto me My Lord is lusty and merry and drinketh with his Men and all the Content he gives me is to abuse me and use me as doggedly as before I think I shall never be happy in this World because he hinders my good and will ever I think so remember I beg for God's sake and get me from this vile Place  Your affectionate loving Daughter FRANCES ESSEX  Give  Turner  warning of all Things but not the Lord I would not have any Thing come out for fear of my Lord Treasurer for so they may tell my Father and Mother and fill their ears full of Noise  There were also shewed in Court certain Pictures of a Man and Woman in Copulation made in Lead as also the Mould of Brass wherein they were cast a black Scarf also full of white Crosses which Mrs  Turner  had in her Custody at the shewing of these and inchanted Papers and other Pictures in Court there was heard a crack from the Scaffolds which caused great fear tumult and confusion among the Spectators and throughout the Hall every one fearing hurt as if the Devil had been present and grown angry to have his Workmanship shewed by such as were not his own Scholars and this Terror coming about a quarter of an Hour after silence proclaimed the rest of the cunning Tricks were likewise shewed  Dr  Forman  's Wife being Administratix of her Husband found Letters in Packets by which much was discovered she was in Court and deposed that Mrs  Turner  came to her House immediately after her Husband's Death and did demand certain Pictures which were in her Husband's Study namely one Picture in Wax very sumptuously apparalled in Silks and Sattins as also one other sitting in form of a naked Woman spreading and laying forth her Hair in a Lookingglass which Mrs  Turner  did confidently affirm to be in a Box and that she knew in what part or room of the Study they were  Mrs  Forman  further deposeth that Mrs  Turner  and her Husband would be sometimes three or four Hours locked up in his Study together She did depose further that her Husband had a Ring would open like a Watch  There was also a Note shewed in Court made by Dr  Forman  and written in Parchment signifying what Ladies loved what Lords in the Court but the Lord Chief Justice would not suffer it to be read openly in the Court  Mrs  Turner  sent  Margaret  her Maid to Mrs  Forman  and wished that all such Letters and Papers as concerned the Earl of  Somerset  or the Countess of  Essex  or any other great Personages should be burned telling her that the Council's Warrant should come to search the Study and that all his Goods might be seized whereupon she and her Maid  Margaret  with the Consent of Mrs  Forman  burnt divers Letters and Papers but yet she kept some without their privity  There were also Inchantments shewed in Court written in  Parchment  wherein were contained all the Names of the Blessed Trinity mentioned in the Scriptures and in another Parchment +  B  +  C  +  D  +  E  and in a third likewise in Parchment were written all the Names of the Holy Trinity as also a Figure in which was written  this word  Corpus  and upon the Parchment was fastned a little piece of the Skin of a Man  In some of these Parchments the Devils had particular Names who were conjured to torment the Lord  Somerset  and Sir  Arthur Manwaring  if their Loves should not continue the one to the Countess the other to Mrs  Turner  Finally These faithful Servants of the  Devil  obtain'd the due Reward of their Deeds Mrs  Turner  was serv'd first who being found guilty of the barbarous Murder committed upon Sir  Thomas Overbury  was Condemn'd for the same and Hang'd at  Tyburn  on  Wednesday    November  Sir  Jarvis Ellowis  was likewise Hang'd for the same on  Monday    November  the th following The Viscount and Countess were likewise found guilty of the said Murder for which they were committed to the  Tower  and although the King pardon'd them they in a short Time pined away their Lives dying in the utmost Disgrace At this Time my Lord of  Somerset  little thought to have been laid in the  Tower  and made Heir of  Overbury  's Bedchamber but by this Course we may see That  all Things are in the Hands of God  FINIS
