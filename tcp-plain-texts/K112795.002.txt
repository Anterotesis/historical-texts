EXTRAORDINARY  FOREIGN AFFAIRS  Paris  THERE have been lately held in the  Rue de Coq  several extraordinary  lits de justice  at which some of the chief persons in the nation have assisted and what is extremely remarkable a Protestant Clergyman has voluntarily administered more than Extreme Unction to a Ghost  From the Paris Alamain  Lishon  Several of the Jesuits who were ex∣iled from this country have gone over to England in disguise The effects of their horrible machi∣nations begin to discover themselves already in the  mysterious affair of the Spirit in CockLane which engrosses the attention of the whole British Nation We are assured by some gentlemen of the English Factory that the absolute laws against witchcraft c will speedily be revived in GreatBritain  IRELAND  Dublin  We hear from London that the Appa∣rition in CockLane has never been seen by nobody  Faulkner's Journal  SCOTLAND  Glasgow  The seventh son of a seventh son is just set out on a walk to London in order to visit the Spirit in CockLane and as this gentle∣tleman is blest with the faculty of second sight it is thought that he will be able to see her  The spirit's great propensity to  scratching  makes it generally supposed here that Miss Fanny died of the  itch  rather than the  smallpox  and that the Ghost is certainly  mangy  LONDON  Yesterday the Committee of Enquiry on the Ghost in CockLane met at the Jerusalem Tavern in Clerkenwell when Miss P was put to bed by one of the maids of honour in the room where  the Cockney's Feast is generally held in the pre∣sence of the Right Hon the Earls of and and the Right Rev the Bishops of and and above fifty more of the nobility  The  knockings  and  scratchings  began about midnight and the examination was in the following manner  Q  Will you go into that pint bottle  point∣ing to a pint bottle that stood on the table  One knock  From the time of this preliminary answer in the affirmative all the subsequent noises issued as from the bottle  Q From the Right Rev looking roguishly at Betty P in bed  Pray Miss Fanny is not your real name Miss BettyMuch scratching as if angry  Q From a lord of the treasury  What is the amount of the national

Committee propose to fit out a privateer to cruise in the RedSea  We hear that the Rev Mr M is preparing a new work for the use of families especially chil∣dren to be published in weekly numbers called  The Ghost's Catechism We have been favoured with a transcript of the Creed which is as follows  Mr M's BELIEF  I BELIEVE in signs omens tokens dreams visions spirits ghosts spectres and

Parson and Fanny together are laid  To the PRINTER of the ST JAMES's CHRONICLE  Thursday May  Mr Baldwin  YOUR trueborn Englishmen your bold Bri∣tons who are lions in the field and sea lions on the ocean are with all their courage the most remarkable of any nation in the world for being seized with a Panick A battle lost or an island taken brings down their high spirits in an instant and the nation is undone An eclipse or a comet with the help of some profound philosopher in the magazines or two or three terrifying paragraphs in the Newspapers shall fill the imagination of all the old women of both sexes with horrible ap∣prehensions of the immediate destruction of the world and groaning proselytes pour in without number to TottenhamCourt and Moorfields It is still fresh in our memories that two slight shocks of an earthquake the most violent of which never shook the pewter off the kitchenshelves in GrosvenorSquare turned the minds of the bold Britons topsyturvy and all London itself seemed going out of town In short the spirits rise and fall in the barometer of English imaginations with most incredible revolutions  Their hopes unless perpetually buoyed up by prosperous circumstances are sure to sink Publick Opinions are as delicate as Publick Credit and it seems as impossible for Englishmen to preserve a man∣ly evenness of temper as to keep the stocks at  par  These reflections occurred on observing the terror that has diffused itself through most fa∣milies on account of the present Epidemical Dis∣temper for so Mr Baldwin you and the rest of your brother newsmongers have taught us to call it They into whose hands our journals may fall in foreign countries must suppose that a plague is raging amongst us The bills of mortality say they are considerably swelled in their number ten are buried in one grave four or five in a family are carried off in one day with other particulars which every body believes though nobody knows to be true It is supposed that there must be some noxious qua∣lity in the air and pieces of beef are sent up from Highgate Hill at the tail of schoolboys kites though it is the received doctrine of writers on all plagues that any pestilential quality in the air affects dogs horses and other animals before it reaches men and would consequently shew itself on the live ox as well as the dead piece of beef For my part as a true Briton I cannot help being  most sensibly offended that Beef the staple food of old England Beef the glory of our country should be prostituted to such purposes In a time of war when provisions of all kinds grow dearer and dearer every day when the price is artfully raised on meat and fish is obliged to be brought to town in the machine of Arts and Sciences I am alarmed lest this prodigality should be the means or at least serve the butchers as a pretence for raising the price of meat still higher and my ap∣prehensions are redoubled when my maid assures me on coming from market that broth being uni∣versally prescribed in the present reigning disorder scraigs of mutton are grown so much in request that the worst end sells for sixpence and sevenpence  per  pound  In the mean time to keep our terrors alive and to prevent the Panick from subsiding in the minds of the people all the Doctors who are authors begin to tell us from the press that colds caught at this season are extremely dangerous and all the booksellers who are venders of the medicines recommend their nostrums by fifty different arti∣fices inserted in advertisements letters para∣graphs cAnd here Mr Baldwin I cannot but observe by the bye what you who are a prin∣ter  must often have observed yourself and know to be true that the connection between author and bookseller is as inseparable as that between whore and bawd a justice and his clerk a counsellor and attorney or according to Congreve a curate and a tobaccostopperthat this connection I say has of late years begun to display itself in a new light for since the doctors have pretty gene∣rally become authors booksellers and printers have acted as a kind of bastard species of apothecaries In the natural course of trade and shopkeeping one would as soon think of sending for a pot of porter to the grocer's or a leg of mutton to the tallowchandler's as for a pill drop or an electu∣ary to the printingoffice or for a powder a balsam or an elixir to the bookseller's Yet so it is medicines and pamphlets are prepared and written by one and the same hand and both  pub∣lished  for that I find is the phrase in each case at one and the same shop Two such ranks of men in combination who are each of them perpetually addressing the publick have opportunities like mountebankpractisers to hawk their own me∣dicines It is their interest in the first place to persuade you that you are sick or that you will be sick and in the next place to persuade you  that nothing but their  nostrum  will insure your re∣covery or prevent your taking the distemper  Now Mr Baldwin having myself a new dis∣covery in medicine to recommend to the publick a preparation that will be of the most infinite service in the present reigning distemper and in all other distem∣pers that ever have affected or ever will or can affect human nature I beg leave to make it known to the world through the channel of your most useful most excellent most entertaining most instructive paper Those you know are the phrases which the correspondents of all publick journals from your own down to the Farthing Post when there was one have always made use of I cannot boast a patent for my medicine But as I shall plainly appear to have only the publick good at heart by declaring its virtues in your Chronicle I will answer for it that the StampOffice shall demand no duty as for an advertisement though you insert it ever so often  To the GOOD PEOPLE of GREATBRITAIN  Venienti occurrite morbo  THE PANACAEA  Or the celebrated Drop and Pill of Temperance and Exercise a sovereign remedy for persons of every  age sex or condition The first may be taken in two or three glasses of wine after dinner white or red port claret burgundy or tokaybut not so well in champaigne Poor folks may take it in smallbeer or porter and though it does not mix well with spirituous liquors yet it may be taken in punch in small quantities It is so far from offending the taste that it gives the highest relish to roast beef or any English dishes and has an admirable effect in plumbpudding Faithfully prepared after the receipts of a lady eminent in kitchen physick The second is a finer diaphore∣tick than James's powder or any preparation of antimonyTo be taken fasting or any hour of the day without loss of time or hindrance of business in the Park at Ranelagh on foot or on horseback or  in quovis vehiculo  Its virtues its healing qualities c c c c are infallible Thousands have been relieved by it The afflicted may depend on its effects  MEDICAL CASE  A gentleman who had long been complaining and complaining and ailing and ailing and who had taken all the medicines in and out of the dis∣pensatory at length applied to the celebrated Doc∣tor  for Radcliffe The Doctor soon perceiving the na∣ture of his case told him that he was in possession of a secret which was infallible for his distemper but that unluckily it was at that time in the hands of Doctor Pitcairne at Edinburgh to whom he would write to apply it in favour of the patient if he himself thought it worth while to go so far in quest of it The patient readily undertook the journey and travelled to Edinburgh but when he arrived there he had the mortification to find that just before Doctor Radcliffe's letter reached Edinburgh Doctor Pitcairne had sent them edicine to Doctor Musgrave of Exeter The patient how∣ever had resolution enough on Doctor Pitcairne's advice to go across the country to Exeter in fur∣ther pursuit of it but as ill luck would have it Doctor Musgrave told him that he had but the day before transmitted it back again to Doctor Radcliffe in London where the patient naturally returned to take the benefit of it at home He could not help laughing with the Doctor at the tour he had taken and at his strange disappointments I went after the medicine said the patient to no purpose and yet I cannot tell how it happens but I am much better than I was when I sat out I know it cries the Doctor I know it You have  got the medicine The journey was the secret And do but live  temperately  and keep yourself in Exercise you will have no occasion for any physick in the world  I am Mr Baldwin Your admirer to be sure Your constant reader And sometimes your writer RHAPSODISTA  To the PRINTER of the ST JAMES's CHRONICLE  Thursday Sept  AND so Mr Baldwin nothing but Politicks will go down with you at present Your old correspondents the Laughers and the Jokers and the Wits and the Criticks and the Poets are all va∣nished and in come the Patriots and the States∣men the Advocates of Liberty and the Quellers of Sedition Not a man but writes as if his country was at stake not a pen that is not drawn as it were  pro aris focis  not a drop of ink that is not shed in the cause of Liberty Property and Religion Party has divided the whole town and  Pro  and  Con  takes up every page of your ChronicleYou call  yourself impartial that is you give both parties a fair opportunity to abuse each other  Audi alteram partem  is your maxim that is in your free trans∣lation  Hear both sides  and indeed they are well worth hearing and what infinite delight must a Scotchman receive after reading a certain portion of abuse on his country and countrymen how charmingly must his indignation be soothed and appeased to find his opponents equally bespattered in the next column But as this kind of impar∣tiality abuses all parties the consequence is that all parties abuse you and each in their turn consider you as the tool of their adversaries Last week in a coffeehouse near St James's I saw a Scotch Colonel who longs for the next regiment that falls throw your paper into the fire provoked by the severity of a letter against Lord Bute and the very next morning I saw the same paper almost as hardly dealt with in the Alley on account of an extract from the Auditor which reflected on the brokers and Mr Pitt Let me tell you Mr Baldwin it is very lucky that you are not obliged to follow your paper wherever it goes and that your figure is not as universally known as the face of your paper I knew a country printer that ventured to insert letters on both sides of the question in his journal  during the county election and I can assure you Mr Baldwin that though he was one of the lus∣tiest men in that country and above six feet high he could scarce put his head out of doors in the course of the whole controversy You I am told are a tight built little black man but by no means such an ablebodied printer as my friend in the country If you cannot weild thé quarterstaff of party with ease and have not power fairly to cudgel your enemies into good humour believe me Sir 'tis dangerous to hobble along on the unequal and un∣steady crutches of two opposite factions Your fugitive scribblers are unknown and leave you to stand buff to the Publick for their labours On the contrary the authors of the several political papers now extant keep the names of their prin∣ters as secret as those of their surgeons and as to themselves they are a match for any thing The club of the Monitor is I am told more formida∣ble than his pen the Briton they say is a raw∣boned Scotsman the Auditor a tall Irishman and the North Briton or the world hugely belies him has a broader pair of shoulders than any author militant in this great metropolis  After all Mr Baldwin I believe you are a mighty good sort of man and mean no harm If  the people of this town will write nothing but Politicks and read nothing but Politicks you are reduced of necessity to print nothing but Politicks because your stationer must be paid your hawkers must be fee'd nay you must give your very devil his due and have an hot joint every day and a pud∣ding on Sunday Yet cannot I forbear admiring the publick spirit of our authors who while their all is at stake while the very nature of literary property is in question neglecting to refute the strange and unnatural doctrine that  "an author has no right to his own work"  are all up in arms on another occasion settling the Ministry and agitating the Preliminaries of Peace For my own part though I have been equally sollicited by both parties and though you are ready to insert my arguments on either side of the question yet I am resolved like Scrub to say nothing  Pro  nor  Con  till we have a PeaceIn the mean time as no∣thing but Politicks will go down to comply in some measure with the humour of the town sup∣pose I oblige you and your readers with a critical review of our political writers I do not mean to give a weekly detail of their arguments to scru∣tinize their characters or criticise particular parts of their productions Heaven forbidall I  intend is to draw their general characters and per∣haps if I happen to be in the right vein for such a whim to give a short sketch of the style and manner of each of them And so Master Bald∣win till you hear from me again I am  Your humble servant RHAPSODISTA  To the PRINTER of the ST JAMES's CHRONICLE  Tuesday Oct  Mr Baldwin  GOING along the streets the other day me∣ditating on the subject I opened to you in my last and considering into what form I should throw my reflections on the present race of poli∣cal writers I stumbled by mere accident on the following M S which I must beg you to commit to the press just as I found it under the title of  THE NORTH BRITON EXRTAORDINARY  June  AN extraordinary circumstance is a suffi∣cient apology for a paper extraordinary The date of this essay will immediately denote the subject of  it and shew that I mean to congratulate the Pub∣lick in general and my countrymen in particular on the occasion of his Majesty's Birthday The NorthBriton is not one of those low scribblers who like that slave the Briton or that prostitute the Auditor mean to write themselves into a place or a pension nor will he be restrained from deliver∣ing his sentiments by the fear of fire pillory or imprisonment The Law shall be his protection and while Lord Mansfield shall preside as Lord Chief Justice in the Court of King's Bench the North Briton shall dread no oppression  On this occasion as well as on every other I shall study to speak out I have not been used to be a respecter of persons I do not after the manner of the old patriots in the Craftsman make use of nicknames The ingenious devices of Lord Gawkee Colonel Catiline and Colonel Squintum Lord Gothamstow Captain Iago Anni∣seed and Parson Bruin and Parson Brawn I leave to the Briton and Auditor I use no aste∣risks the names of Dukes and Lords and Mini∣sters are written at full length for I am above all evasion Wherefore without further preface or preamble I gladly seize the opportunity of this great anniversary to congratulate those of our  inclining that we have now a Prince upon the throne who is an absolute Jacobite  However paradoxical such an assertion may appear I have no doubt of being able to demon∣strate it as clearly as any proposition in Euclid  Imprimis  the groundwork and first principle of Jacobitism is to cherish the warmest sentiments for the family of Stuart Lord Bute I dare venture to assert it is of the Stuart family He is himself a Stuart He cannot deny it It is a circumstance which ministerial advocates may palliate but which like that of his being a true Scot they cannot dissemble Yet Scot and Stuart as he is we have seen him Secretary of State and we now see him at the head of the Treasury I say we see a Scotsman the reader may recollect I have written a whole paper on this subject at the head of the Treasury There is a passage in Archbishop Spotswood p by which it appears that during the troubles of that condemned Stuart Charles I there was at one time in his Majesty's Treasury the immense sum of seven shillings and sixpenceA sum that might almost rival the contents of the Bank of Edinburgh which sometimes discounts bills to nearly that amount Yet Lord Bute is at the head of a treasury drawing schemes to raise at one time  millions of English pounds I might say hundreds of millions did I mean Scotch pounds double the number of the above shillings How then can we doubt his Majesty's attachment to the family of Stuart Demosthenes said of the Pythian oracle that it Philipised we do not want an En∣glish Demosthenes who might say that his Majesty Stuartiseth that is being interpreted He is a Jacobite  To prove this still further let us consider that during the two former reigns of the present family every Scotsman was kept at as great a di∣stance from court as Edinburgh is from London and all countrygentlemen commonly called To∣ries were doomed to remain for ever in the coun∣try never receiving the least encouragement to come to St James's How is all this reversed at present It is held no crime to be born on the other side of the Tweed nay the immense sum of four thousand pounds is allowed by parliament towards building a bridge over that stream to facilitate the communication between the two united king∣doms or rather to pave the way for Scotsmen to come over into England And here I would hum∣bly submit to the commissioners appointed by the legislature that the bridge may contain only a  footway for alas we too well know that their maxim is  Vestigia nulla retrorsum  and when they have once walked hither not one of them will drive their carriages back again  Had Cain been Scot c  The passage is as well known as any in Fingal or John Hume's tragedies Add to all this that known Tories men who during the several loyal administrations were marked for Jacobites whom Kings were taught to call so are now daily seen at St James's The rage of party hath entirely subsided places of power and profit are bestowed on gentlemen of Oxfordshire and members of the Cocoatree The University of Oxford itself which was declared in the House of Commons  "to be paved with Disaffection and Jacobitism"  begins to receive encouragement their addresses engage attention and we hear of Oxford Bishops and Prebendaries in a word how could all these things be How could it come to pass unless his Majesty were a Jacobite that Tories should be in place that Lord Bute should have power that knights of the Thistle should be created knights of the Garter and Scotsmen be seen in broadcloth and breeches  The Pretender is now said to be at Avignon Now in case we should send an embassador extraor∣dinary  to Paris it may be fairly presumed that his Majesty  Here Mr Baldwin here ends imperfect and unfinished this curious manuscript The Publick will easily recognise the style manner and senti∣timents of their old friend and will undoubtedly regret as well as you and I that such a subject so happily begun should be left incomplete The loss of this first part of the copy and the subject being temporary I suppose were the reasons of this essay's not making its appearance in due season beautifully printed on a sheet and half of fine writing paper Be it your care to preserve this precious portion of it and to make some amends for the loss of the rest I have subjoined the following letter originally designed to be sent to the same paper  TO THE NORTH BRITON  SIR  NOTHING was ever more evident than the present partiality to Scotsmen To enu∣merate all the particulars of it would be endless I shall confine myself to one single instance You were one of the first to cry out against the mini∣stry  on the loss of Newfoundland Give me leave to point out some scandalous instances of partiality that attend the retaking that island  Imprimis  Who commanded that expeditionLord Colvilla ScotsmanWho brought home the French coloursCaptain Campbella ScotsmanWho came home with the news greatly praised for his spirit and activity in the SyrenCaptain Douglasa ScotsmanBut above all who were the only three officers wounded and consequently placed like the English by Prince Ferdinand in the post of Honour Capt M'Donnell Capt Bailie and Capt M'KenzieAll three Scotsmen  I will not dwell on the mean national reflection so injurious to the Irish in the first part of his Lordship's letter where he writes these Irish∣men said that if I would go into the Bay of  Bulls  numbers of their countrymen would resort to me c  I am Sir Your humble servannt PATRICK KELLY  Oct  And now Mr Baldwin I shall take my leave of you though perhaps I may soon send you some strictures on other political writers In the mean time I am as before yours  RHAPSODISTA  To the PRINTER of the ST JAMES's CHRONICLE  Saturday Oct  Mr Baldwin  I Have been in much pain on your account since the publication of the NORTH BRITON EXTRA∣ORDINARY which I enclosed to you in my last I was at first very glad to find that no∣body questioned its authenticity but soon began to tremble for its consequences Some said that the messengers had seised you your compo∣sitors pressmen devils c Some foretold mo∣tions in the King'sBench provoking vengeance and letting all the terrors of the law loose upon you Others prognosticated your being called up to the bar of both Houses while those who were your most sanguine admirers heartily wished that for the convenience of carrying on your paper you had like the Gazetteer an house adjoining to Newgate At length however I begin to hope that you are quite out of danger and that in this season of the general massacre of characters some licence will be allowed to you as well as your brethren I would advise you at all events to give the world fresh proofs of your impartiality and to ballance the account fairly between both parties Expel  one poison by another or to speak more respect∣fully of our controversial writers let diamond cut diamond Publish in your next to make amends the inclosed Auditor which to use the words of the Auditor  the Publick may depend on as authentick  full as authentick as the last paper I sent you  THE AUDITOR EXTRAORDINARY  I'll be an AUDITOR  AN ACTOR too perhaps if I see cause  MIDSUM NIGHT'S DREAM  Audire est Operae Pretium illorum Impudentiam  TER  Hear for each hearer must applaud it  Of  their vile impudence  MY AUDIT  IT is a disagreeable circumstance to be stationed on guard like the outposts of an army just on the confines of the enemy's camp Yet are there some considerable advantages resulting from such a situation for in such a situation the earliest intelligence may be obtained and while  "the hum of either army stilly sounds"  anecdotes of the most curious nature may be collected as hath already more than once been experienced and manifested by the Auditor Nor can I think that the perform∣ing this kind of duty is in the phrase of Bobadil  service of danger  as it is well known my an∣tagonist fierce and furious as he is can take the  field and come even within pistol shot of his ad∣versary without the least ill consequence to one party or the other  For my own part I am possessed of such a so∣vereign contempt for him or if you please them be he or they of the singular plural or according to the Grecians of the dual number that it is not without the utmost disdain that I thus descend into the  Arena  with such paltry opponents The late Mr Fielding of humourous memory in one of his CoventGarden Journals though I do not know whether that paper be extant in the elegant edition of his works lately published by Arthur Murphy Esq hath I remember comically proved that the most contemptuous animal in the creation is a  Louse  and has described one of those animalcules overflowing with a true qualitycon∣tempt of the mean creature whose head he inha∣bited  I am I must confess  the Louse  to the  North Briton  I sit weekly in judgement on his head on the produce whereof he perhaps may live but I cannot for the deplorable sterility of that spot feeds nothing but my  contempt  I run over the bar∣ren region more barren than the country he con∣tinually reviles with all the avidity of the little  human bloodsucker Here perhaps I discover an abortive vein of Prosaick Poetry there branches out many a Ramification of Political Vi∣rulence and there in a remote corner of the  Pia Mater  is lodged a small portion of Bayes's Spirit of Brains which like the Spirit of Laws would require the pen of a Montesquieu to describe its qualities at large but it is in fact no other than the Spirit of Dulness which serves  "the lively dunce"  instead of Wit and Humour and produces that airy nothingness that vivacious stupidity so evident in all his publications  It hath however been discovered by microsco∣pical observers that a Louse is a very lousy animal in consequence whereof while I am thus banquet∣ing on the North Briton sundry lesser lice are preying upon me The engineers of Grubstreet to change the allusion like the garretteers in the ingenious new print of the ingenious Mr Hogarth are daily squirting upon me to all these as well as to the ArchEnemy I oppose nothing but  Con∣tempt  I indulge myself in a warrantable pride and the virtuous consciousness of my own superi∣ority I exert all my adroitness and dexterity to turn their own arms against them and they have at length instructed me as Charles the Twelfth did  the Russians to be their conqueror Complaining eternally of the lamentable dulness and scurrility of factious scribblers I stop the tide of political slander and open afterwards at pleasure the sources for my own use and benefit I silence with a tone of authority the clamours of the malcontent against a noble Lord and his coadjutors in employment and then I immediately raise my voice to its highest pitch and cry out lustily against the Grand Pen∣sioner and Lord Gawkee I reprobate the bold practice of licentiously printing names at full length without so much as modestly embowelling or rather  emvowelling  them or pleasantly holding their own∣ers in greater derision by a contemptuous altera∣tion of them after which doctrine the next pa∣ragraph in my Aylesbury Journal recites the names of Wilkes and Churchill and several others with∣out the least disguise while poor Hodges and Beardmore and Charles Say run glibly into almost every sentence  Contempt then sovereign contempt is plainly the best weapon offensive or defensive in the hands of a writer of controversy And what ob∣jects can be more worthy to excite that passion than those on which I have exercised my own  What is Lord Gawkee that nounadjective Lord joining his false consequence like an idle epithet to that proud substantive the Grand Pensioner His Temple of Worthies the collection of Wor∣thies of StoweTemple is not I am told yet complete Let him fill the vacant niches with his friends Let him put up his own bust and by way of supporters let him place Colonel Catiline on one hand and his Reverend Coadjutor on the other What is the Grand Pensioner that sold slave for ever bellowing about liberty that hireling who receives his regular wages without doing the service for which he is paid I may perhaps some time or other by the assistance of Cocker's Arithmetick shew my knowledge in fractions and strike the balance between him and the nation Such a political ledger may perhaps prove that he is in∣debted to the Publick for more than three thousand  per ann  and their gold boxes What are the city of London  A mob  a foolish crew with furs and chains huzzaing their idol their king in stilts as Mr Hogarth has pictured him in vain endeavouring to set the world on fire and holding the bellows to blow the dead coal of sedition They say I am an advocate for Aristocracy I have turned over  Sidney and Puffendorf and fifty other writers in the course of my little reading and find no form of government so dangerous as a Mobocracy The clenched fists are indeed the patriot arms of such a state their only law is club law and their chief logick is the  Argumentum Baculinum  which is with them the knock down argument Such is the custom of the city of London What are all the political writers of the present times except the Briton and  myself  The scum of Grubstreet the dregs of the church and the refuse of the legislature I have convicted the apostate Monitor as well as his patron the Grand Pensioner of political tergi∣versation I have put to rebuke the petulant flip∣pancy of the North Briton and have proved him to be a haberdasher of small literature the pub∣lisher of a  Chronique Scandaleuse  the conductor of a weekly libel The reverend half of him I have shewn to be a mere Oldmixon in politicks diving among the Naiads of Fleetditch in the mud of Scurrility The  other  half of him half military and half legislative I have shown to be a down∣right Catiline hatching a conspiracy or assassina∣tion plot against the characters of the first persons in the kingdom and like Lord Shaftesbury in Hudibras  So politick as if one eye  Upon the other were a spy  That to trapan the one to think  The other blind both strove to blink  Sometimes I content myself with calling him contemptuously  an impudent fellow  and sometimes I find that he wrote his paper when  exceedingly drunk  and therefore I disdain to give him a sober reply  Contempt  is the only tribute proper to be paid by men of veracity and honour to wretches of their character base slanderers who have reviled and still continue to revile all orders of men the Commonalty the Lords Spiritual and Temporal the Royal Family and Me  I shall add nothing Mr Baldwin to this long essay which I am quite fatigued with transcribing though perhaps you may hear from me  once more  on this subject when I shall send you a Catalogue which may serve as a corollary to this short view of the present state of politicks in GreatBritain  Yours as before RHAPSODISTA  To the PRINTER of the ST JAMES's CHRONICLE  CRETA an CARBONE notandi  HOR  Crayon'd in purest CHALK or etch'd  From a rough draught in CHARCOAL sketch'd  Saturday Feb  Mr Baldwin  THE following Columns contain nothing more than two separate lists of the celebrated personages who have at any time been honoured with notice by the AUDITOR or NORTH BRITON These lists I know must necessarily be imperfect because they are taken down merely upon memory and because such keen Satirists cannot so grossly have mispent their time as to have lashed so few people yet I have been the less curious to render these lists complete because I know that the writers in question are such stirring spirits that they will each be continually swelling their seve∣ral catalogues for which reason I have contented myself with leaving certain vacant spaces for the insertion of such names already distinguished as I must without doubt have omitted or to be filled up as time shall serve and the AUDITOR or NORTH BRITON shall hereafter please to direct  Let us however do justice to the candour as well as acrimony of our Political Writers They deal in Panegyrick as well as Satire If they throw dirt with the scavenger's shovel they also lay on Praise with a trowel Every modern con∣troversial writer in Politicks sits down with Enco∣mium on the right and Obloquy on the left like Jupiter between the tubs of Good and Evil or to lower my simile like brother Pamphlet in the Up∣holsterer with whitewash in one hand and black∣ball in the other All their characters or rather caricatures may be considered as the Rough Draughts of the masters in the modern school of crayons who sometimes draw in Chalk but most commonly in Charcoal It was my first intention to have given both the Chalk and Charcoal Por∣traits of each of the great masters in question but I soon reflected that I might save that trouble by desiring your readers to take it for a general rule that such as are blackened in the NORTH BRITON are by Act of Grace whitewashed in the AUDITOR and so  vice versâ  Every great character like a post or a wainscot is destined to be painted in dif∣ferent colours at least twice over and in this various light we may at pleasure consider the Two Following Columns either as the two principal pillars of the Temple of Slander or the two tables  in the Temple of Fame As we are now how∣ever at the very opening of Lent I would have the noble lords and gentlemen whose names ap∣pear in these lists to regard the perusal of them as an act of humiliation and mortification and to remember that they have been told their own by the great writers under whose aweful names they are here arranged  It must however be premised as our fixt opi∣nion that the AUDITOR is by far the most respectable character and the most polite and learned writer of the two The NORTH BRITON sounded the Nether Trump of Fame at the very first onset and furiously charged the Scots and the Ministry at once The AUDITOR set out with professions of moderation and impartiality he did not seek for Defamation but it lay in his way and he found it mark his candid declarations in his first number  "The malevolent are not to expect to be gratified with Slander the illiberal with Scurrility or the inconsiderate with Buffoonery Ingredients like these can have no admission into a paper which is undertaken upon principles laudable in themselves which is intended to reconcile the minds of men to their own good and to one another to refute or laugh out of counte∣nance  all partydistinctions to extinguish na∣tional prejudices and to recommend that spirit of concord which alone can make us a success∣ful and preserve us an happy people In short it is intended in the conduct of this plan to try whether it is possible to talk Politicks with tem∣per to delineate characters with Decency to treat of factions with Good Humour and to love our Country without hating Individuals"  Here are mild words and yet in the second number he serves up no less than six or seven individuals and some of them no inconsiderable personages neither and yet even this trifling inconsistency may be ac∣counted for if we recollect that the AUDITOR himself begins his ninth number with this reflexion  "It is a curse entailed upon the retainers to despair∣ing faction that they are not only Miserable Men and Wretched Writers but they must be Lyars into the bargain they must forge Crimes to affright the people they must scatter abroad the words of prevarication c c"  AUDITOR  NORTH BRITON  Duke of Cumberland  P D of W  Duke of Newcastle  Duke of Bedford  Duke of Devonshire     Earl

above lists not only shew who have been the Butts of Satire to each writer but may also with due attention to the turnings and windings in the Court Calendar serve as unerring guideposts to point out such as seem to be in the high road to abuse from either paper Being made acquainted with the Colour of the heroes of both parties we  know that if a great officer of the court should be turned out or to use the more courtly phrase  resign  the AUDITOR will immediately tear out the white leaf wherein he so lately sang his praises and like another Peachum set his name down in his  black book  and call on him to exercise the full powers of the Christian virtue of  resignation  We know too that if a noble Member of one House should call for an able Commoner to lead the business of the other the NORTH BRITON will immediately open his deep mouth on that leader and maul a Manager with as great alacrity as Mr Thady Fitzpatrick But as rules and precepts are never clearly en∣forced unless illustrated by example I will sub∣mit a small Peep into Futurity to your readers and as I have in some places above rather made extra∣ordinary distinctions in favour of the AUDITOR I shall here pay my particular compliments to the NORTH BRITON We have already seen whom that writer has abused craving his pardon for the grossness of the expression and the AUDITOR's list of Scandal craving his pardon also is a pretty exact catalogue of those whom the NORTH BRITON has praised I shall now therefore Mr Baldwin take upon me to predict with as much sagacity as Partridge or even Bickerstaff  whom he  will  praise whom he  will  abuse and whom he may possibly praise or abuse and for the fulfilling these my predictions I refer to time or even appeal to the Second Sight of the NORTH BRITON himself Some that are turned out I know he will take every opportunity to praise and that class I shall distinguish by Chalk some that are put in I know he cannot resist the temptation of dispraising and that class I shall distinguish by Charcoal But there are another class of a du∣bious indeterminate twilight character whose conduct will not suffer us to speak precisely of the colour of their intentions a kind of heteroge∣neous or amphibious animals Hermaphrodites or Otters in Politicks neither in nor out  Pro  nor  Con  Court nor Country Whig nor Tory Scotch nor English who are like Sir Anthony Branville in a State of Fluctuation and hang like Mahomet's coffin in suspence who seem ready to veer and turn like approved weathercocks with every gust of politicks who stand between  Ay  and  No  like the ass of the schoolmen between two bundles of hay or like Prince Volscius in love hiphop hiphop one boot on and the other boot off These Statesmen of the neuter gender we can place in neither list and yet they seem to bid fair  for a place in both Where then can we station these lovers of the Golden Mean but in the Middle In the Middle therefore upon stilts between both one foot on one list the other foot on the other list I have placed one Right Hon Gentleman as the grand archetype of political scepticism Far be it from me to arraign such commendable Prudence and Moderation but as the NORTH BRITON is not such an admirer of impartiality I have reason to think that he will not long permit this gentle∣man to remain in a state of indifferency he will not be content to say of him  ALBUS an ATER homo sit nescio  but having once brought himself to imagine that he has discovered the gentleman's biass he will soon be induced to favour us with a portrait of so distinguished a

To the PRINTER of the ST JAMES's CHRONICLE  Thursday April  SIR  I Remember to have seen many Letters in your Chronicle and other of the Publick Papers against the Bill for regulating Franks which Letters I suppose were written by persons whose interest or convenience was in some measure likely to be affected by the proposed regulation I Mr Baldwin with due reverence to the Hon House I declare it am a Member of Parliament one of those mem∣bers who most heartily concurred in passing the bill first of all in a patriot view being persuaded it would make a yearly addition of seventy thou∣sand pounds to the revenue of the PostOffice which is now publick property and secondly in  a private light imagining it would save myself a great deal of trouble in Franking Letters for re∣lations friends acquaintance constituents c c But alas Mr Baldwin I find the first of these benefits expected to result from the new limi∣tations very uncertain and the last merely ideal and though I have but little of the leaven of opposition in my temper yet I now most sincerely repent of the concessions I have made and wish that many others as well as myself had insisted more steadily on the preservation of our Privilege and not have resigned it almost entirely to the Clerks of the PostOffice who will perhaps be as great gainers by these new regulations as the members of both Houses will be losers As to the advantage resulting to the revenue from these restrictions I shall leave them to be determined by Fact and Experience and I shall also shew by Fact and woeful Experience that the trouble usually given to Members of Parliament in the article of Franking instead of being the least diminished will be considerably increased  Coming home from the House a few days ago I found lying on my writingtable a large packet with the following superscription  "Mr L's compliments to Mr M and begs the favour of  him to Frank and Direct the inclosed covers a dozen with the following addressTo Mrs L at Sir Hugh Llanvilly's at Llanvilly Park near Llanvilly Merionethshire WalesHalf a dozenTo Mr Latitat Attorney at Law at Bewdly near WorcesterHalf a dozenTo G L Esq of Trinity College CambridgeA dozenTo Mr L himself in SackvilleStreet Piccadilly to be used by his son when he writes to him from Cambridge and one dozen moreTo Miss Trippit at Sir William Trippit's GrovePark Berkshire a constant correspondent of Mr L's eldest daughter"  Such Mr Balwin was the substance of this po∣lite card and give me leave to say that consider∣ing Mr L is but a common acquaintance with whom I sometimes take a turn in the Queen's walk or whom I now and then join in a morning's ride in HydePark or meet in an evening at the Mount coffeehouse I never saw a more consum∣mate piece of assurance The cool impudence of it startled me at first but on recollection I de∣termined to take no farther notice of it than to order it as we do idle papers in the House to lie upon the table  A very short period since has however con∣vinced me that I am to expect many such applica∣tions Several other equally modest persons have taken occasion to hint to me that they shall expect the like favour some of whom are people whom I by no means chuse to offend and others are such whom I am under some kind of necessity to oblige My wife Mr Baldwin if you are a married man you will easily conceive that I cannot refuse all the fiddlefaddle correspondence of my four daughters my nieces and some other Misses of their particular acquaintance must also pass under my Franks and Direction As to my constituents as I represent the inhabitants of a most respectable city in the West of England where I am brought in for Nothingthat is where no Bribery prevails and it only costs me about l in treating cHow I say Mr Baldwin can I forbear to comply with the demands of my constituents  Some of my friends to avoid the trouble of writing their names over and over provided them∣selves formerly with a stamp but if they could not away with the single trouble of Franking how will they digest the additional one of Directing Another inconvenience is that when the Frank and Address are both in one hand the inclosed  letter must also naturally be supposed to come from the same person It is easy to conceive situations wherein this circumstance must be par∣ticularly disagreeable especially to grave old gentlemen like myself whereas before all letters however directed passed without the least imputa∣tion on the characters of the lords or gentlemen who franked them I have known a letter to GrubStreet pass without astonishment under the sanction of the Earl of Chesterfield and have seen a cover franked by an Archbishop filled up without scandalising even the postman with a direction to Haddock's Bagnio  Such and many more are the inconveniencies likely to arise on this occasion to members of par∣liament But we have brought them on ourselves and must take them for our pains For my part my chief concern is the trouble which I shall en∣deavour to save by all the means I am able to devise or which you Mr B or any of the ingenious correspondents in your Chronicle are able to suggest My present intention is to send to the fellow whom we committed to Newgate for forging Franks and who will necessarily be enlarged at the rising of the parliament offering to take him into pay in  case he wants employment and promising to re∣commend him to several lords and gentlemen of my acquaintance  I am Sir Your humble servant L M  Doverstreet  To the PRINTER of the ST JAMES's CHRONICLE  Saturday April  SIR  I Have seen in your paper the preface to Poems by a Journeyman Shoemaker and have also perused several of the Poems themselves with a singular pleasure though I must own with much less surprise than the generality of his readers That Stephen Duck the thresher should leave the barn for the garret or that Jones the bricklayer should attempt to Build the Lofty Rhime were indeed circumstances somewhat extraordinary unless the first had been contented merely to wield the Flail of Satire and the last to use the Trowel of Panegyrick neither of which were the case But that James Woodhouse the journeyman  Shoemaker should as the preface tells us  "sit at his work with a pen and ink by him and when he has made a couplet write it down on his knee"  is not I think altogether so miraculous as the other two instances since there always appeared to me to be a very strict analogy between Versemaking and Shoemaking Almost every Crispin sings at his work why may not our  Crispinus  also compose He may surely by no unnatural association of ideas think at one and the same time of the Feet of his Verses and the Feet of his Customers or Hammer out a line while he is Hammering out the sole of a shoe It is easy also for him to adapt his poetical exercises to the various circumstances of his Sandalian Employments He may turn his mind to familiar comick subjects  privatis prope Socco car∣minibus  while he is manually operating on a pair of leathern socks and he may with the same kind of sympathy between head and hand rise to all the heights of the tragick sublime  Carmina digna Cothurno  while he is making a pair of buskins which you know Mr Baldwin are now very much in fashion If our author's ambition inspires him too soon to Epick and to sing with Homer    the wellbooted Grecians  he may work on boots He would I doubt not dispatch  a book with every pair especially if he throws in a pair or two of shoes now and then as he goes along by way of Episode Pindarick Odes which are often on Equestrian subjects may be dispatched with Spatterdashes light airy Verses with Pumps and all easy careless Gentlemanlike Compositions with Slippers  Scholars Mr Baldwin who want to engross all the provinces of literature do not care that any body should write but themselves and though the Muses themselves are females yèt if a lady makes verses they are arrogant enough to bid her learn to make a pudding Versemaking is in the present age generally speaking as mechanical as Shoemaking Why then should not a poor me∣chanick shew his industry both ways especially a Shoemaker whose profession as I have endea∣voured to shew is so consistent with that of a Poet and who can write verses without neglecting his other business or rendering himself liable to the censure contained in the old adage of  ne sutor ultrà crepidam  I am Sir Your most humble servant CRISPINUS SCRIBLERUS  To the PRINTER of the ST JAMES's CHRONICLE  Saturday July  SIR  IN a note to one of M D'Eon's famous letters written from London to the Duke of Niver∣nois is the following remarkable passage  After the earthquakes which happened here in a Lifeguard Man took it into his head to foretell a third which was to overthrow London He called himself inspired and with an enthu∣siastical air fixed the day the hour and the mi∣nute London being already in a consternation at the remembrance of two shocks at the exact distance of a month from each other and still more terrified at the expected approach of a third more terrible earthquake which the en∣thusiastical soldier had announced for the th of April the Town shewed itself susceptible of all kinds of impressions More than inhabitants on the faith of this oracle had that day betaken themselves to flight The greater part of those whom the arguments or railleries of their friends had detained waited with trembling the critical instant and shewed no kind of cou∣rage  till it was over When the day arrived the prophecy like most other predictions was not accomplished the false Samuel was sent somewhat too late to Bedlam and the heads of these fierce islanders so wise and so philosophi∣cal were not proof against the prophecy of a madman  Such Mr Baldwin are the pictures which Frenchmen who come among us frequently draw of our nation Taking a hearsay story for fact and passing off misrepresentations for truth they pretend to decide from thence on the manners and character of the people commonly founding their opinions on vague reports idle pamphlets and papers rather than on their own observations on real life Thus the story of the BottleConjurer first ridiculed in pamphlets at home gave us among foreigners the character of a credulous people and Bielfield mentions it in his letters as an instance of our rage for Spectacles as if the whole town had been crammed into the Little Theatre in the Haymarket and as if every body there present on that occasion really expected to see a man get into a Quart Bottle This is the opinion that foreigners generally entertain of that affair and  in compliment to their own wisdom they conclude that the English are Fools  The subject of M D'Eon's note gives them also as they imagine another specimen of our charac∣ters and M D'Eon himself having I suppose picked up this story among other tabletalk since his arrival in England puts it into French and flourishes away upon it most triumphantly But did M D'on see the who ran out of town No Was he in London No In England No But he has heard that a lifeguardman fore∣told a third earthquake and that some weak people were frightened at it These he calls the Town and multiplies them into fifty thousand emigrants and lays on the remaining thousands no other restraint than shame and the fear of ridicule It is easy for a lively Frenchman to draw the severest conclusions from such false premises But let me ask him where is that wise and philosophical me∣tropolis among which there are no weak persons and are they the proper persons to fit for the true portrait of a nation Suppose exactly the same cir∣cumstances had happened at Paris would not the  Bois de Boulogne  have been as full of coaches as HydePark was on that occasion Would it be candid in an Englishman residing at Paris fourteen  years after not only to multiply to but to throw also the same ridicule which they had drawn on themselves on all the rest of the town And yet would it not be very easy for such an Englishman to give himself an insolent air and to say  "The faith of this bigotted nation was pinned on a prophecy perhaps not half so ridi∣culous as many other articles of their belief and volatile understandings like chaff before the wind were blown to and fro by the breath of a madman"  I am Sir Your humble servant F G  To the PRINTER of the ST JAMES's CHRONICLE  Tuesday Oct  Mr Baldwin  WE Two who have now determined to become your joint correspondents and like the two hands to pull together on this occasion al∣though like them We are always on different sides We Sir We say and Our ancestors have been members of parliament time out of mind  We as well as Our respective predecessors have it is true very often changed Our sides but then like partners in a country dance We have each of us  crossed over  and now and then in case of a coalition of parties  joined hands  for the sake of  figuring in  We are in general not a very talkative family delighting chiefly in monosyllables and thinking a word  from  the wise as well as a word  to  the wise fully sufficient The truth is We are like sheep a gregarious kind of animal and if one leaps over a hedge or into a ditch all the rest follow but though We have little or no cause at least no ostensible one for Our conduct yet We think ourselves infinitely obliged to those ingenious gentlemen who after all is over are so kind as to assign a plausible reason for what We have done The principal end of this letter therefore Mr Baldwin is to return thanks in both Our names to all political writers  Pro  and  Con  AUDITOR and NORTH BRITON Defenders of Minority or Majority for taking the trouble to investigate the motives of Our parliamentary behaviour and enabling Us to defend Our several causes with arguments We never heard nor ever thought of before We are both prepared to enter the scene of business again soon after Christmas  We know Our cues and Our parts are but short but when We have performed them We shall be obliged to those gentlemen who will again under∣take to shew that We seemed to follow nature and that they could not perceive that We were moved like Puppets or like live actors stood in need of a Prompter We are Sir and We are not  Your humble servants AY AND NO  To the PRINTER of the ST JAMES's CHRONICLE  Thursday Nov  INTELLIGENCE EXTRAORDINARY  Drury Lane  LAST night was performed at this theatre for the first time a new comick opera called the Capricious Lovers written by Mr Lloyd and founded as the author informs us on a French piece of Monsieur Favart called  Les Caprices d' Amour ou Ninette à la Cour  Being no great admirers of Operas serious or comick we cannot help saying that we think Mr Robert Lloyd deserves much censure on this occasion for these two reasons first for linking  his theatrical labours with those of a composer and secondly for entering the field of Opera with the arms of Sense and Poetry There are charms enough in this piece to seduce us into a liking of this Species of the Drama and Mr Lloyd is un∣warily sacrificing to a Castrato Apollo instead of that manly vigorous God of Poetry for whom he and his lamented friend Churchill have always pro∣fessed so sincere an adoration And yet after all Mr Lloyd has entirely mistaken the matter in writing elegant words in order to be adapted to musick for it is a fact founded on experience that nothing is so harmonious as nonsense as a recent proof of which maxim we will venture to say that Mr Rush's composition in the serious Opera of the Royal Shepherd in which Opera there was scarce one line of sense was infinitely superior to his musical labours in the Capricious Lovers in which last entertainment we assigned to the author the first place to the performers who were most ex∣cellent the second and to the composer but not without an interval betwixt them the third Not that we mean to depreciate the talents of Mr Rush or that we do not readily allow his having exerted them in the composition of several elegant airs in this Opera but merely to observe that perhaps  for want of use sense is not so pliant under his hands as nonsense and that he lavished much ex∣cellent musick on many a melodious  For  or  The  or  And  in the Royal Shepherd last year which would have been better bestowed had he reserved it for the excellent poetry of the airs in this OperaThe dialogue also has much merit as well as the airs for which the author is partly indebted to the original French though we cannot but observe that much of the part of Lisetta and all the comick scenes between Hobbinol and Damon together with their lively appearance in the cata∣strophe with all which circumstances the audience were so highly entertained are entirely newThe performers did great justice to their characters It would be great injustice not to confess the me∣rit and uncommon excellence of Mrs Clive Mr Yates and Mr Vernon Indeed the execution of the whole Opera afforded us much entertainment and we liked it but too well  In order to give our country readers a specimen of the words we shall subjoin two songs though indeed they may rather be called elegant little poems than mere airs in the Opera There are several others of equal merit  AIR V  When the head of poor Tummas was broke  By Roger who play'd at the wake  And Kate was alarm'd at the stroke  And wept for poor Tummas's sake  When his worship gave noggins of ale  And the liquor was charming and stout  O those were the times to regale  And we footed it rarely about  Then our partners were buxom as Does  And we all were as happy as kings  Each lad in his holiday cloaths  And the lasses in all their best things  What merriment all the day long  May the feast of our Colin prove such  Odzooks but I'll join in the song  And I'll hobble about with my crutch  AIR XVII  For various purpose serves the fan  As thus a decent blind  Between the sticks to peep at man  Nor

of the ST JAMES's CHRONICLE  Thursday Oct  NOTES on the PREFACE to  Mr Johnson's Edition  of  Shakespeare  published this morning  JOHNSON's Shakespeare published when this morningwhat at last  vix tandem  'egad he has observed Horace's rule of  nonum in annum  Keep the Piece nine years as Pope saysI know a friend of mine that subscribed in fiftysixc c c  Such perhaps is the language of some little wit∣ling who thinks his satirical sallies extremely poignant and severe but the appearance of any production of Mr Johnson cannot fail of being grateful to the literary world and come when  they will like an agreeable guest we are sure to give them a hearty welcome though perhaps we may have betrayed some little impatience at their not coming sooner Nor have the publick in general been deceived None but subscribers have a right to complain and they I suppose in general meant to show their respect for Mr Johnson rather than to give themselves a title of becoming clamorous creditors  But granting our editor to be naturally indolentand naturally indolent we believe him to bewe cannot help wondering at the number vastness and excellence of his productions A Dictionary of our language a series of admirable essays in the Rambler as well as if we are not misinformed several excellent ones in the Adventurer an edition of Shakespeare besides some less considerable works all in the space of no very great number of years and all these the productions of a mere Idler We could wish there were a few more of such indolent men in these kingdoms  Of the general merit of this new edition of Shakespeare we cannot now be expected to give any account It was published but this morning but as we obtained a sight of the editor's valuable pre∣face a few days ago we shall now oblige our rea∣ders  with a few extracts from it together with some remarks which we have taken the liberty to subjoin for the freedom of which we make no apology as Mr Johnson need not now be told that notwithstanding  "the tenderness due to living reputation and veneration to genius and learning he cannot be justly offended at that liberty of which he has himself so frequently given an example"  After some introductory matter concerning the degree of merit which we may suppose to be stamped on works by the suffrage of antiquity the writer proceeds thus  SHAKESPEARE is above all writers at least above all modern writers the Poet of Nature the Poet that holds up to his readers a faithful Mirrour of Manners and of Life His characters are not mo∣dified by the customs of particular places un∣practised by the rest of the world by the pecu∣liarities of studies or professions which can ope∣rate but upon small numbers or by the accidents of transient fashions or temporary opinions they are the genuine progeny of common humanity such as the world will always supply and observa∣tion will always find His persons act and speak by the influence of those general passions and prin∣ciples  by which all minds are agitated and the whole system of life is continued in motion In the writings of other poets a character is too often an individual in those of Shakespeare it is commonly a species  Having given some further illustration of this argument the editor proceeds in the following terms  His adherence to general nature has exposed him to the Censure of Criticks who form their judgments upon narrower principles Dennis and Rhymer think his Romans not sufficiently Roman and Voltaire censures his Kings as not completely Royal Dennis is offended that Menenius a Senator of Rome should play the buffoon and Voltaire perhaps thinks decency violated when the Danish usurper is represented as a drunkard But Shakespeare always makes nature predominant over accident and if he preserves the essential character is not very careful of distinctions superinduced and adventitious His story requires Ro∣mans or Kings but he thinks only on Men He knew that Rome like every other city had men of all dispositions and wanting a buffoon he went into the Senate House for that which the Senate House would certainly have afforded him  He was inclined to shew an usurper and a mur∣derer not only odious but despicable he therefore added drunkenness to his other qualities knowing that Kings love wine like other men and that wine exerts its natural power upon Kings These are the petty cavils of petty minds a poet over∣looks the casual distinction of country and con∣dition as a painter satisfied with the figure ne∣glects the drapery  Has not Mr Johnson here made too liberal a concession to Dennis and on an examination of the play of Coriolanus would it not appear that the character of Menenius though marked with the peculiarities of an hearty old gentleman is by no means that of a buffoon Many have defended Polonius who is much less respectable than Menenius  The editor then enters into a very sensible and spirited vindication of the mingled drama of Shake∣speare and the interchange of serious and comick scenes in the same play His reflections on this subject he closes in the following terms  When Shakespeare's plan is understood most of the criticisms of Rhymer and Voltaire vanish away The play of Hamlet is opened without impropriety by two Centinels Iago bellows at Brabantio's window without injury to the scheme  of the play though in terms which a modern au∣dience would not easily endure the character of Polonius is seasonable and useful and the Grave Diggers themselves may be heard with applause  Shakespeare engaged in Dramatick Poetry with the world open before him the rules of the an∣cients were yet known to few the publick judg∣ment was unformed he had no example of such fame as might force him upon imitation nor cri∣ticks of such authority as might restrain his extra∣vagance He therefore indulged his natural dispo∣sition and his disposition as Rhymer has remarked led him to Comedy In Tragedy  he often writes with great appearance of toil and study what is written at last with little facility  but in his comick scenes he seems to produce without labour what no labour can improve In Tragedy he is always struggling after some occasion to be comick but in Comedy he seems to repose or to luxuriate as in a mode of thinking congenial to his nature In his tragick scenes there is always something want∣ing but his Comedy often surpasses expectation or desire His Comedy pleases by the thoughts and the language and his Tragedy for the greater part by incident and action His Tragedy seems to be skill his comedy instinct  This opinion in which Mr J concurs with the Arch Zoilus of our author is however very disputable and we cannot help thinking that what is said in this place as well as what is after∣wards thrown out on this head in speaking of his faults is infinitely too strong A good com∣ment on parts of Othello Hamlet Lear Mac∣beth and other tragick scenes of Shakespeare or perhaps a mere perusal of them would be the best method of confuting these assertions  To the PRINTER of the ST JAMES's CHRONICLE  Saturday Oct  NOTES on the PREFACE to  Mr Johnson's Edition  of  Shakespeare  continued  IN his comick scenes he is seldom very success∣ful when he engages his characters in Reciprocations of Smartness and Contests of Sarcasm  Anglice  Repartee Dryden in one of his pre∣faces calls it  "a Quick Chace of Wit"  but so many writers so many styles  But the admirers of this great poet have most reason to complain when he approaches nearest to his highest excellence and seems fully resolved to sink them into dejection and mollify them with tender emotions by the Fall of Greatness the Dan∣ger of Innocence or the Crosses of Love  Does Mr J mean to refer his readers to the Fall of Wolsey the Distresses of Lear the Mur∣ders of Duncan and Desdemona c c or was his mind wholly occupied by some quibbling scenes in Romeo and Juliet and the Midsummer's Night's Dream  A quibble was to him the fatal Cleopatra for which he lost the world and was content to lose it  Has not Mr J been as culpably fond of writ∣ing upon Quibble as Shakespeare in persuing it and is not his laboured paragraph upon quibble as puerile as a remnant of a schoolboy's decla∣mation Besides was it not a vice common to all the writers of that age  Familiar Comedy is often more powerful on the Theatre than in the page Imperial Tragedy is always less  Imperial Tragedy such at least as is attended with these effects is of all others the coldest and  that Tragick Writer has but very ill effected the purposes of that species of Drama whose produc∣tions are more powerful in the Page than on the Theatre Cato perhaps may possess more dignity and force in the closet but we know that Richard Lear Othello c have most power on the stage  Those whom my arguments cannot persuade to give their approbation to the judgement of Shake∣speare will easily if they consider the condition of his life make some allowance for his ignorance  There is much good sense sound criticism and fine writing in these observations on the Unities and it is certain that a strict observation of the Unities of Time and Place have not only  "given more trouble to the poet than pleasure to the Auditor"  but have perhaps created as many absurdities as they have prevented yet it were to have been wished that Mr J had in this as in all other instances rather maintained the character of a reasoner than assumed that of a pleader All liberties may be carried to an excess and the violation of these Unities may be so gross as to become unpardonable Shakespeare himself seems to have been sensible of this and therefore introduced the Chorus into  Henry the Fifth to waft us from shore to shore and for the same reason he brings in the personage of Time in the character of Chorus in the Winter's Tale to apologise for the lapse of sixteen years the distance between the supposed birth of Perdita and her appearance as the nymph beloved by Florizel It might have been worth while therefore to have endeavoured in some measure to ascertain how far these Unities may allowably be transgressed Such an investigation by Mr J would have still enhanced the value of this excellent Preface and must have been agreeable to all readers  There has always prevailed a tradition that Shakespeare wanted learning that he had no regular education nor much skill in the dead languages Jonson his friend affirms that he had small Latin and no Greek  Mr J certainly quotes from memory in this place The affirmation of Ben Jonson is that Shakespeare  "had small Latin and  less  Greek"  which implies his having some share of both Even in our times a man who has some Greek has commonly a pretty competent knowledge of Latin  Such verse we make when we are writing prose we make such verse in common conver∣sation  It is remarkable that Dennis though perhaps undesignedly has here exemplified his own ob∣servation  To the PRINTER of the ST JAMES's CHRONICLE  Thursday Nov  SIR  I Have seen and read the Remarks which you were pleased to subjoin to the Extracts from Mr Johnson's Preface to his Edition of Shake∣speare and hope that the same Remarker having concluded his comments on the Preface will proceed to examine the work itself In the mean time if the following observations on some of our new editor's notes on the play of Henry the Fifth appear to be worth your notice you are welcome to publish them in your Chronicle I had no particular reason for singling out this play but when my books for which I had long since sub∣scribed came home the fourth volume happened to be the first that I cut open and Harry V the  first play that I perused Hereafter perhaps if some abler critick does not take the task out of my hands I may send you my observations on some others  FIRST  For 'tis your thoughts that now must deck our Kings  Carry them here and there  We should says Mr J read  King  for  Kings  The prologue relates only to this play The mis∣take was made by referring  Them  to  Kings  which belongs to  Thoughts  Not to mention the harshness of referring  Them  to  Thoughts  instead of  Kings  to which it naturally and obviously belongs  Kings  is proper in relation only to this play The Kings of France and England are those here intended by Shakespeare who says in the same spirit but a few lines before  Suppose within the girdle of these walls  Are now confin'd  two mighty monarchies  SECOND  Hugh Capet also who usurp'd the crown  Of Charles the Duke of Lorrain sole heir male  Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great  To fine his title with some shews of truth  Though in pure truth it was corrupt c  This is the reading of the old quarto and Dr W very properly explains  "to fine his title"  to sig∣nify  "to refine or improve it"  which interpre∣tation the Poet's pursuing the allusion by the word  Corrupt  in the next line confirms But Dr J would read to  Line  his Title which he endea∣vours to support by a passage from Macbeth But besides that the word  Line  occurs in the verse immediately preceding and would therefore have been probably rejected by the most hasty writer had it presented itself the metaphor used in the old reading is more easy and natural  THIRD  Exeter  But there's a saying very old and true  If that you will France win then with Scotland first begin  For once the eagle England being in prey  To her unguarded nest the weazel Scot  Comes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs  Playing the mouse in absence of the cat  To taint and havock more than she can eat  Ely  It follows then the cat must stay at home  Yet that is but a Crush'd Necessity  Since we have locks to safeguard necessaries  And Pretty Traps to catch the Petty Thieves  Crush'd Necessity  the reading here retained in this passage is that of the folios The old quarto has it  Curs'd  Necessity Sir T Hanmer reads  Yet that is not o'Course a Necessity  Dr W contends for  'Scus'd  Necessity meaning  Excused  and Mr J says we might read a  Crude  Necessity All the criticks concur in supplying a word of the same signification supposing that Ely would shew that there is not an Absolute Necessity which indeed is the sense that the whole context taken together seems to point out It appears to me that the old quarto with a very slight emen∣dation would give the true reading Omit the single letter S and for  Curs'd  Necessity which is an error of the press read  Cur'd  Necessity and that small alteration produces the meaning that the con∣text requires and the criticks have endeavoured to strike out A very ingenious gentleman of my acquaintance proposes to read a Cur's Necessity in allusion to the fable of the dog in the manger But I think it does not fall in with the rest of the passage  Not having any other edition by me at present I cannot tell whether the word  Pretty  in the last  line be not an error of the press in Mr Johnson's if not I should suppose that Shakespeare wrote  And Petty Traps to catch the Petty Thieves  FOURTH  On part of the Second Chorus Mr Johnson has the following note  And by their hands this grace of kings must die  If Hell and Treason hold their promises  Ere he takes ship for France and in Southampton  Linger your patience on and well digest  Th' abuse of distance while we force a play  The sum is paid the traitors are agreed  The king is set from London and the scene  Is now transported gentles to Southampton  There is the playhouse now  I suppose every one says Mr J that reads these lines looks about for a meaning which he cannot find There is no connection of Sense nor regularity of Transition from one thought to the other It may be suspected that some lines are lost and in that sense the case is irretrievable I ra∣ther think the meaning is obscur'd by an acci∣dental transposition which I would reform thus  And by their hands this grace of kings must die  If Hell and Treason hold their promises  The sum is paid the traitors are agreed  The king is set from London and the scene  Is now transported gentles to Southampton  Ere he takes ship for France And in Southampton  Linger your patience on and well digest  Th' abuse of distance while we force a play  There is the playhouse now  This alteration continues Mr Johnson re∣stores sense and probably the true sense The lines might be otherwise ranged but this order pleases me best  But the original order pleases Me best Mr Baldwin nor can I conceive how any reader of the lines can look about for a meaning without finding it or indeed how he can miss finding it under his nose without looking about at all Where lies the difficulty In the three first lines Let us examine them  And by their hands this grace of kings must die  If Hell and Treason hold their promises  Ere he takes ship for France and in Southampton  The meaning of this is that there was a plot to kill the King in Southampton before he could em∣bark on his French expedition This the King himself explains  this man  Hath for a few light crowns lightly conspir'd  And sworn unto the practices of France  To kill us here in Hampton  Surely the words  "And in Southampton"  did not puzzle Mr Johnson Can an editor of Shake∣speare be confounded by an Elleipsis so frequent in that author and all other poets  "The King must die ere he take ship for France and must die in Southampton"  What can be clearer Besides the arrangement proposed is much more confused and inelegant than that in which the lines stand at present For instance  And by their hands this grace of kings must die  If Hell and Treason hold their promises  By placing a full stop in this place instead of a comma and by omitting the third line  Ere he takes ship for France and in Southampton  By these injudicious alterations you are only generally informed of a plot without the alarm∣ing particulars given in the original reading And only mark how very aukwardly this poor trans∣posed line is squeezed into another corner  The sum is paid the traitors are agreed  The king is set from London and the scene  Is now transported gentles to Southampton  Ere he take ship for France And in Southampton  Linger your patience on and well digest  Th' abuse of distance while we force a play  There is the playhouse now  Here I think comes out that the unfortunate words  "and in Southampton"  were the stumblingblocks to our editor But is not this new disposition of the lines much for the worse and would one not almost be tempted to suppose from the great distance between the King and the relative pronoun He that the Scene was to  "take ship for France"  The proposed alteration therefore introduces con∣fusion instead of restoring sense and the old reading in this case as in most others gives the true sense The lines indeed might perhaps be otherwise ranged but this order is the most natu∣ral and the best  Fearing that I may have already trespassed too far on your paper I shall reserve the continuation of these remarks

of the present age how unjustly Voltaire no friend to this country has taken no∣tice observing that the English answered the charge by carrying their conquests into every quarter of the globe  Were I to attempt to assign the reigning princi∣ple that governs all ranks and orders of men in this kingdom I should not hesitate to mention the Spirit of Prodigality and Extravagance which may now be said to be epidemical raging with equal violence in court and city town and coun∣try and confounding high and low rich and poor one with another  Set a beggar on horseback says the old English proverb and he will ride to the Devil though the devil himself as Sir Francis Wronghead observes would scarce imagine that he would ride post to him and yet at present every beggar has got on horseback and seems resolved to run a race with his superiors  That he who has nothing or perhaps is worse than nothing should not be afraid of being ruined is not very wonderful but that they who are as happy as a good fortune can make them should take the greatest pains to divest themselves of the means of that happiness I have ever thought very extraordinary That a Frog should swell with envy and burst itself in order to become a Bull is a fable whose moral one may readily compre∣hend but what Aesop of antiquity would have described the noble Bull tormented with the same  mean pride and roaring and tossing and bel∣lowing till it reduced itself even below the state of the wretched animal it mighttrample on  Great goingsout to quote another old saying must have great comings in He who now lives to the

Extravagance is mentioned as a characteristick of the Manners of the present age You must be allowed to have your share of it  Many an honest gentleman has been ruined by his wife's inordinate desire to outvie the wife of his neighbour A violent passion for Dress Equi∣page and Company are avowedly female failings but Gaming that fiend which is too hot even for masculine souls has usurped a dominion over the minds of our countrywomen Conversation and fireside society is almost quite lost among us Familyvisits Blindman'sbuff and Hotcockles are no more Every evening assembly is a route and cards the occupation of every meeting at which every body who plays play higher than they can afford from the PennyQuadrille of Blackfriars to the unlimited Lu in the liberties of Westminster  Extravagance however like many other vices commonly counteracts itself and defeats its own ends Prodigals even during the short period of their splendor rather render themselves ridiculous than important in the eyes of the multitude The world is commonly furnished with ma∣terials to judge pretty accurately of the income of particulars and they who seem palpably to exceed the measure of their circumstances instead of creating admiration excite pity or contempt It would seem almost incredible therefore did not  experience confute all speculation that any persons should be so mad as to forfeit all the future happiness of their lives for the sake of exposing themselves to publick derision for a few short months or at most for a very few years The patience of creditors is soon exhausted and a distressed gentleman who is often put upon Ways and Means will soon find it very difficult and at last quite impossible to raise the Supplies He that will not take up in good time and put himself under a proper regimen for the evils incurred by his extravagance may be assured that the disease will at last cure itself An acquaintance of mine who loves a pun often compares a prodigal to a clock he can  go  says he as long as he can  tick  but when he can  tick  no longer he must  stand  I would recommend it therefore to every man who is about to contract debts to consider whe∣ther

of a particular stamp He is an excellent classical scholar perhaps one of the best Latinists in Europe He has combined in himself two talents which sel∣dom meet he is both a good English and Latin  poet Had his inclination led him to have mixed with the fashionable world where he was warmly invited and had he been a nearer inspector of the follies and vices of high life he would certainly have been called by the election of the best criticks to the Poetical Chair where Pope sat without a ri∣val till his death and then the Laurel like the kingdom of Macedonia at the death of Alexander was divided among many It must be owned that Dr Johnson's two Satires in imitation of Juvenal are among the best titles that have been produced for the poetical inheritance  Indeed his morals and manners are so ill suited with loose opinions and thoughtless dissipation that it is no wonder he was soon disgusted with what he saw and heard and which he so well painted and felt in his LONDONHis second Satire the tenth of Juvenal though written with great force and energy yet seems more the fruit of study than observation His sagacity is wonderful though  nearsighted  he can discover and describe with great humour the nice discriminations and almost im∣perceptible touches of the various characters of both sexes his "  mind's  eye" has a keenness and certainty that seldom misses the mark and

PUBLIC ADVERTISER  Wednesday Feb  SIR  IN my boyish days I remember reading in Busby's English Grammar of the Latin Tongue that  "K was out of fashion"  That poor unfortunate Letter is now almost equally unfashionable in our own language and unless you or some other po∣pular writer as universally read will interpose in its favour this old member of the Alphabet will perhaps soon be entirely cut off The good offices of a Printer however are not much to be expected for though we formerly heard of such a respectable Substan∣tive as  the  PUBLICK we daily see one of your fra∣ternity rejecting this old servant and giving us a Paper entitled  The  PUBLIC  Advertiser  To reconcile orthography to strict pronunciation is fantastical ridiculous and illiterate It origi∣nally relished of etymology and in written speech some etymological traces ever should remain Ho∣nest K has long stood in our language as a memo∣rial of its origin and as the Greek χ is represented in English by the letters ch so the final  que  of the French was formerly signified by the English k But fashion fearful of pedantry gives no quarter to etymology The Publick are invited by your advertisements to performances tragi  c  and comi  c  and concerts of musi  c  and to our utter astonish∣ment a modern dramatick poet has announced  The Choleric Man  under the auspices of Mr Garri  c  whose Gal  lick  genealogy and Gal  lick  patrony  mick  are universally known and who has himself so largely contributed to render immortal the name of  Garricque  Tamely to follow fashions is poor and servile to run before them argues a great and lively genius Content not yourself therefore Mr Woodfall with the present partial detruncation of the final k but boldly lop it off from every word wherein it now occurs and do equal justice to  the quic  and the dead The  tric  is easily played let ambition  pric  the sides of your intent the multitude will  floc  after you  the  critics  cannot find fault with you for following their own example and the whole  Republic  of Let∣ters will  crac  of your exploits in bringing this King Log to the  bloc  I am Sir Your humble servant BLAC AND ALL BLAC  Berwicstreet  ☞ The above Letter was productive of the following from another hand which appeared in the same paper the succeeding Saturday Feb  To the PRINTER of the PUBLIC ADVERTISER  Smyrna Coffeehouse  Wednesday Morning  SIR  YOUR ingenious Correspondent BLAC  and all  BLAC has very humourously exposed the af∣fectation of some  modern  Writers who are attempt∣ing to  kic  the letter  k  out of the alphabet This ridiculous innovation I hope will be crushed in the bud and your Correspondent certainly deserves well of the REPUBLIC OF LETTERS by endeavour∣ing to save an useful member  There is a very whimsical friend of mine who has long conceived so great an aversion to poor  k  that at last he has totally proscribed himhe con∣trives to omit him in  words  where one would have thought it impossible to do without him such as knife and fork corkscrew wigblock c which he writes  nife  and for  c  cor  c  s  c  rew wigblo  c  c In order to place his antipathy to  k  in the most stri  k  ing light permit me to lay before your Readers the following Epistle which I received from him a few days ago  My dear Friend  One misfortune they say generally comes on the ba  c  of another I have had an atta  c  of my old disorder which has confined me these three wee  c  s to a si  c  bed I have swallowed amazing quantities of physi  c  and yet could seldom get a win  c  of sleep for whole nights Indeed it was partly my own fault for instead of proceeding in the regular tra  c  I have been playing tri  c  s with my constitution by purchasing Qua  c  Medicines from a damn'd Mounteban  c  in our neighbour∣hood however by good lu  c  and just in the ni  c  when I was on the point of splitting on a ro  c  in stepped Dr A He went upon t'other ta  c  obliged the empiri  c  to pa  c  off and instead of phy∣si  c  ordered me to drin  c  plenty of sa  c  whey or Old Ho  c  and water Though I feel a considerable wea  c  ness and some reli  c  s of the disorder yet al∣ready I begin to pi

better employed in  coaxing  the Colonies or mauling the Minister I hope that enough has aleady been said to prevent the innocent  k  from arbitrary and unjust proscription  I am Sir Your humble servant K's FRIEND  CRITICAL REFLECTIONS ON THE OLD ENGLISH DRAMATICK WRITERS  CRITICAL REFLECTIONS ON THE OLD ENGLISH DRAMATICK WRITERS  To DAVID GARRICK Esq  SIR  IT is not unnatural to imagine that on the first glance of your eye over the advertisement of a new pamphlet addressed to yourself you are apt to feel some little emotion that you bestow more than ordinary attention on the title as it stands in the newspaper and take notice of the name of the publisherIs it Compliment or AbuseOne of these being determined you are perhaps eager to be satisfied whether some coarse hand has laid on en∣comiums with a trowel or some more elegant wri∣ter such as the author of  The Actor  for instance has done credit to himself and you by his panegy∣rick or on the other hand whether any offended Genius has employed those talents against you which he is ambitious of exercising in the service of your Theatre or some common Scribe has taken your  character as he would that of any other Man or Woman or Minister or the King if he durst as a popular topick of scandal  Be not alarmed on the present occasion nor with that consciousness of your own merit so na∣tural to the Celebrated and Eminent indulge your∣self in an acquiescence with the justice of ten thou∣sand fine things which you may suppose ready to be said to you No private Satire or Panegyrick but the general good of the Republick of Letters and of the Drama in particular is intended Though Praise and Dispraise stand ready on each side like the vessels of Good and Evil on the right and left hand of Jupiter I do not mean to dip into either or if I do it shall be like the Pagan Godhead himself to mingle a due proportion of each Some∣times perhaps I may find fault and sometimes bestow commendation but you must not expect to hear of the Quickness of your Conception the Justice of your Execution the Expression of your Eye the Harmony of your Voice or the Variety and Excellency of your Deportment nor shall you be maliciously informed that you are shorter than Barry leaner than Quin and less a favourite of the Upper Gallery than Woodward or Shuter  The following pages are destined to contain a Vindication of the Works of Massinger one of our Old Dramatick Writers who very seldom falls much beneath Shakespeare himself and sometimes almost rises to a proud rivalship of his chiefest ex∣cellencies They are meant too as a laudable though faint Attempt to rescue these admirable Pieces from the too general neglect which they now labour under and to recommend them to the Notice of the Publick To whom then can such an Essay be more properly inscribed than to You whom that Publick seems to have appointed as its chief  Ar∣biter Deliciarum  to preside over the Amusements of the TheatreBut there is also by the bye a private reason for addressing you Your honest friend Davies who as is said of the provident Comedians in Holland spends his hours of vacation from the theatre in his shop is too well acquainted with the Efficacy of your Name at the top of a Playbill to omit an opportunity of prefixing it to a new Publication hoping it may prove a charm to draw in purchasers like the head of Shakespeare on his sign My Letter too being anonymous your name at the head will more than compensate for the want of mine at the end of it and our above∣mentioned friend is no doubt too well versed in  both his occupations not to know the consequence of Secrecy in a Bookseller as well as the Necessity of concealing from the Publick many Things that pass  behind the Curtain  There is perhaps no country in the world more subordinate to the power of fashion than our own Every Whim every Word every Vice every Vir∣tue in its turn becomes the mode and is followed with a certain rage of approbation for a time The favourite style in all the polite Arts and the reigning taste in Letters are as notoriously objects of caprice as Architecture and Dress A new Poem or Novel or Farce are as inconsiderately extolled or decried as a Ruff or a Chinese Rail a Hoop or a Bow Window Hence it happens that the publick taste is often vitiated or if by chance it has made a proper choice becomes partially at∣tached to one Species of Excellence and remains dead to the Sense of all other Merit however equal or superior  I think I may venture to assert with a confidence that on reflection it will appear to be true that the eminent Class of Writers who flourished at the beginning of this century have almost entirely su∣perseded their illustrious Predecessors The Works of Congreve Vanbrugh Steele Addison Pope  Swift Gay c c are the chief study of the Million I say of the Million for as to those few who are not only familiar with all our own Au∣thors but are also conversant with the Ancients they are not to be circumscribed by the narrow li∣mits of the Fashion Shakespeare and Milton seem to stand alone like firstrate Authors amid the ge∣neral wreck of Old English Literature Milton per∣haps owes much of his present fame to the gene∣rous Labours and good Taste of Addison Shake∣speare has been transmitted down to us with succes∣sive Glories and you Sir have continued or rather increased his Reputation You have in no fulsome strain of compliment been stiled the Best Commentator on his Works But have you not like other Commentators contracted a narrow ex∣clusive Veneration of your Author Has not the Contemplation of Shakespeare's Excellencies almost dazzled and extinguished your Judgement when directed to other objects and made you blind to the Merit of his Cotemporaries Under your dominion have not Beaumont and Fletcher nay even John∣son suffered a kind of Theatrical Disgrace And has not poor Massinger whose cause I have now undertaken been permitted to languish in Obscu∣rity and remained almost entirely unknown  To this perhaps it may be plausibly answered nor indeed without some foundation that many of our Old Plays though they abound with Beauties and are raised much above the humble level of later Writers are yet on several accounts unfit to be exhibited on the modern Stage that the Fable in∣stead of being raised on probable incidents in real Life is generally built on some foreign Novel and attended with Romantick Circumstances that the Conduct of these Extravagant Stories is frequently uncouth and infinitely offensive to that Dramatick correctness prescribed by late Criticks and prac∣tised as they pretend by the French Writers and that the Characters exhibited in our Old Plays can have no pleasing effect on a modern Audience as they are so totally different from the manners of the present age  These and such as these might once have ap∣peared reasonable objections but You Sir of all persons can urge them with the least grace since your Practice has so fully proved their insufficiency Your Experience must have taught you that when a Piece has any striking Beauties they will cover a multitude of Inaccuracies and that a Play need not be written on the severest plan to please in the re∣presentation The mind is soon familiarized to Ir∣regularities  which do not sin against the Truth of Nature but are merely Violations of that strict De∣corum of late so earnestly insisted on What patient Spectators are we of the Inconsistencies that confes∣sedly prevail in our darling Shakespeare What critical Catcall ever proclaimed the indecency of in∣troducing the Stocks in the Tragedy of Lear How quietly do we see Gloster take his imaginary Leap from Dover Cliff Or to give a stronger instance of Patience with what a Philosophical Calmness do the audience dose over the tedious and uninterest∣ing LoveScenes with which the bungling hand of Tate has coarsely pieced and patched that rich Work of ShakespeareTo instance further from Shakespeare himself the Gravediggers in Hamlet not to mention Polonius are not only endured but applauded the very Nurse in Romeo and Ju∣liet is allowed to be Nature the Transactions of a whole History are without offence begun and com∣pleated in less than three hours and we are agree∣ably wafted by the  Chorus  or oftener without so much ceremony from one end of the world to an∣other  It is very true that it was the general Practice of our old Writers to found their Pieces on some fo∣reign Novel and it seemed to be their chief aim to  take the story as it stood with all its appendant incidents of every complection and throw it into Scenes This method was to be sure rather inar∣tificial as it at once overloaded and embarrassed the Fable leaving it destitute of that beautiful Drama∣tick Connection which enables the mind to take in all its Circumstances with Facility and Delight But I am still in doubt whether many Writers who come nearer to our own times have much mended the matter What with their Plots and DoublePlots and CounterPlots and UnderPlots the Mind is as much perplexed to piece out the story as to put to∣gether the disjointed Parts of our Ancient Drama The Comedies of Congreve have in my mind as little to boast of accuracy in their construction as the Plays of Shakespeare nay perhaps it might be proved that amidst the most open violation of the lesser critical Unities one Point is more steadily pursued one Character more uniformly shewn and one grand Purpose of the Fable more evidently ac∣complished in the productions of Shakespeare than of Congreve  These Fables it may be further objected founded on romantick Novels are unpardonably wild and extravagant in their Circumstances and exhibit too little even of the Manners of the Age in which they  were written The Plays too are in them∣selves a kind of heterogeneous composition scarce any of them being strictly speaking a Tra∣gedy Comedy or even TragiComedy but rather an indigested jumble of every species thrown together  This charge must be confessed to be true but upon examination it will perhaps be found of less consequence than is generally imagined These Dramatick Tales for so we may best stile such Plays have often occasioned much pleasure to the Reader and Spectator which could not possibly have been conveyed to them by any other vehicle Many an interesting Story which from the diver∣sity of its circumstances cannot be regularly re∣duced either to Tragedy or Comedy yet abounds with Character and contains several affecting situ∣ations and why such a Story should lose its force dramatically related and assisted by representation when it pleases under the colder form of a Novel is difficult to conceive Experience has proved the effect of such fictions on our minds and convinced us that the Theatre is not that barren ground wherein the Plants of Imagination will not flourish The Tempest The Midsummer Night's Dream The Merchant of Venice As you like it Twelfth  Night The Faithful Shepherdess of Fletcher with a much longer list that might be added from Shakespeare Beaumont and Fletcher and their co∣temporaries or immediate successors have most of them within all our memories been ranked among the most popular Entertainments of the Stage Yet none of these can be denominated Tragedy Come∣dy or TragiComedy The Play Bills I have observed cautiously stile them Plays and Plays indeed they are truly such if it be the end of Plays to delight and instruct to captivate at once the Ear the Eye and the Mind by Situa∣tions forcibly conceived and Characters truly delineated  There is one circumstance in Dramatick Poetry which I think the chastised notions of our modern Criticks do not permit them sufficiently to consider Dramatick Nature is of a more large and liberal quality than they are willing to allow It does not consist merely in the representation of real Charac∣ters Characters acknowledged to abound in com∣mon life but may be extended also to the exhi∣bition of imaginary Beings To create is to be a Poet indeed to draw down Beings from another sphere and endue them with suitable Passions Af∣fections Dispositions allotting them at the same  time proper employment  "to body forth by the Powers of Imagination the forms of things un∣known and to give to airy Nothing a local Habi∣tation and a Name"  surely requires a Genius for the Drama equal if not superior to the delineation of personages in the ordinary course of Nature Shakespeare in particular is universally acknow∣ledged never to have soared so far above the reach of all other writers as in those instances where he seems purposely to have transgressed the Laws of Criticism  "He appears to have disdained to put his Free Soul into circumscription and confine"  which denied his extraordinary talents their full play nor gave scope to the Boundlesness of his Imagination His Witches Ghosts Fairies and other Imagi∣nary Beings scattered through his plays are so many glaring violations of the common table of Dramatick Laws What then shall we say Shall we confess their Force and Power over the Soul shall we allow them to be Beauties of the most ex∣quisite kind and yet insist on their being expunged And why except it be to reduce the Flights of an exalted Genius by fixing the Standard of Excellence on the practice of Inferior Writers who wanted parts to execute such great designs or to accommodate  them to the narrow ideas of small Criticks who want souls large enough to comprehend them  Our Old Writers thought no personage whatever unworthy a place in the Drama to which they could annex what may be called a  Seity  that is to which they could allot Manners and Employ∣ment peculiar to itself The severest of the An∣tients cannot be more eminent for the constant Pre∣servation of Uniformity of Character than Shake∣speare and Shakespeare in no instance support his Characters with more exactness than in the conduct of his Ideal Beings The Ghost in Ham∣let is a shining proof of this excellence  But in consequence of the custom of tracing the Events of a Play minutely from a Novel the au∣thors were sometimes led to represent a mere human creature in circumstances not quite consonant to Nature of a disposition rather wild and extravagant and in both cases more especially repugnant to mo∣dern ideas This indeed required particular indul∣gence from the spectator but it was an indulgence which seldom missed of being amply repaid Let the writer but once be allowed as a necessary  Da∣tum  the possibility of any Character's being placed  in such a situation or possest of so peculiar a turn of mind the behaviour of the Character is per∣fectly natural Shakespeare though the Child of Fancy seldom or never drest up a common mortal in any other than the modest dress of Nature But many shining Characters in the Plays of Beau∣mont and Fletcher are not so well grounded on the Principles of the human Heart and yet as they were supported by Spirit they were received with Applause  Shylock  's Contract with the Penalty of the Pound of Flesh though not Shakespeare's own fiction is perhaps rather improbable at least it would not be regarded as a happy Dramatick Inci∣dent in a modern Play and yet having once taken it for granted how beautifully nay how naturally is the Character sustainedEven this objection therefore of a deviation from Nature great as it may seem will be found a plea insufficient to ex∣cuse the total exclusion of our antient Dramatists from the Theatre Shakespeare you will readily allow possest Beauties more than necessary to re∣deem his Faults Beauties that excite our admira∣tion and obliterate his errors True but did no portion of that Divine Spirit fall to the share of our other old Writers And can their works be sup∣pressed  or concealed without injustice to their merit  One of the best and most pleasing Plays in Massin∣ger and which we are told was originally received with general approbation is called  The Picture  The fiction whence it takes its title and on which the story of the Play is grounded may be collected from the following short scene Mathias a gen∣tleman of Bohemia having taken an affecting leave of his wife Sophia with a resolution of serving in the King of Hungary's army against the Turks is left alone on the stage and the play goes on as follows  Math  I am strangely troubled Yet why should I nourish  A fury here and with imagin'd food  Having no real grounds on which to raise  A building of suspicion she ever was  Or can be false hereafter I in this  But foolishly inquire the knowledge of  A future sorrow which if I find out  My present ignorance were a cheap purchase  Though with my loss of being I have already  Dealt with a friend of mine a general scholar  One deeply read in Nature's hidden secrets  And though with much unwillingness have won him  To do as much as art can to resolve me  My fate that followsTo my wish he's come  Enter  Baptista  Julio Baptista now I may affirm  Your promise and performance walk together  And therefore without circumstance to the point  Instruct me what I am  Bapt  I could wish you had  Made trial of my love some other way  Math  Nay this is from the purpose  Bapt  If you can  Proportion your desire to any mean  I do pronounce you happy I have found  By certain rules of art your matchless wife  Is to this present hour from all pollution  Free and untainted  Math  Good  Bapt  In reason therefore  You should fix here and make no farther search  Of what may fall hereafter  Math  O Baptista  'Tis not in me to master so my passions  I must know farther or you have made good  But half your promiseWhile my love stood by  Holding her upright and my presence was  A watch upon her her desires being met too  With equal ardour from me what one proof  Could she give of her constancy being untempted  But when I am absent and my coming back  Uncertain and those wanton heats in women  Not to be quenched by lawful means and she  The absolute disposer of herself  Without controul or curb nay more invited  By opportunity and all strong temptations  If then she hold out  Bapt  As no doubt she will  Math  Those doubts must be made certainties Baptista  By your assurance or your boasted art  Deserves no admiration How you trifle  And play with my affliction I'm on  The Rack till you confirm me  Bapt  Sure Mathias  I am no God nor can I dive into  Her hidden thoughts or know what her intents are  That is deny'd to art and kept conceal'd  E'en from the devils themselves They can but guess  Out of long observation what is likely  But positively to fortell that this shall be  You may conclude impossible all I can  I will do for you When you are distant from her  A thousand leagues as if you then were with her  You shall know truly when she is solicited  And how far wrought on  Math  I desire no more  Bapt  Take then this little model of Sophia  With more than human skill limn'd to the life  Each line and lineament of it in the drawing  So punctually observ'd that had it motion  In so much 'twere herself  Math  It is indeed  An admirable piece but if it have not  Some hidden virtue that I cannot guess at  In what can it advantage me  Bapt  I'll instruct you  Carry it still about you and as oft  As you desire to know how she's affected  With curious eyes peruse it While it keeps  The figure it now has entire and perfect  She is not only innocent in fact  But unattempted but if once it vary  From the true form and what's now white and red  Incline to yellow rest most confident  She's with all violence courted but unconquer'd  But if it turn all black 'tis an assurance  The fort by composition or surprize  Is forc'd or with her free consent surrender'd  Nothing can be more fantastick or more in the extravagant strain of the  Italian  Novels than this Fiction And yet the Play raised on it is extremely beautiful abounds with affecting Situations true Character and a faithful Representation of Nature The story thus opened proceeds as follows Ma∣thias departs accompanied by his friend and serves  as a volunteer in the Hungarian army against the Turks A complete victory being obtained chiefly by means of his valour he is brought by the Ge∣neral to the Hungarian court where he not only re∣ceives many honours from the King but captivates the heart of the Queen whose passion is not so much excited by his known valour or personal at∣tractions as by his avowed constancy to his wife and his firm assurance of her reciprocal affection and fidelity to him These circumstances touch the pride and raise the envy of the Queen She re∣solves therefore to destroy his conjugal faith by giving up her own and determines to make him a desperate offer of her person and at the same time under pretence of notice of Mathias's being detained for a month at Court she dispatches two young noblemen to tempt the virtue of Sophia These incidents occasion several affecting Scenes both on the part of the Husband and Wife Mathias not with an unnatural and untheatrical Stoism but with the liveliest Sensibility nobly withstands the temptations of the Queen Sophia though most virtuously attached to her husband becomes uneasy at the feigned stories which the young lords recount to her of his various gallantries at court  and in a fit of jealousy rage and resentment makes a momentry resolution to give up her ho∣nour While she is supposed to be yet under the dominion of this resolution occurs the following Scene between the Husband and his Friend  MATHIAS and BAPTISTA  Bapt  We are in a desperate straight there's no evasion  Nor hope left to come off but by your yielding  To the necessity you must feign a grant  To her violent passion or  Math  What my Baptista  Bapt  We are but dead else  Math  Were the sword now heav'd up  And my neck upon the block I would not buy  An hour's reprieve with the loss of Faith and Virtue  To be made immortal here Art thou a scholar  Nay almost without a parallel and yet fear  To die which is inevitable You may urge  The many years that by the course of nature  We may travel in this tedious pilgrimage  And hold it as a blessing as it is  When innocence is our guide yet know Baptista  Our virtues are preferr'd before our years  By the Great Judge To die untainted in  Our fame and reputation is the greatest  And to lose that can we desire to live  Or shall I for a momentary pleasure  Which soon comes to a period to all times  Have breach of faith and perjury remembered  In a still living epitaph No Baptista  Since my Sophia will go to her grave  Unspotted in her faith I'll follow her  With equal loyalty But look on this  Your own great work your masterpiece and then  She being still the same teach me to alter  Ha sure I do not sleep Or if I dream  The picture altered  This is a terrible vision I will clear  My eyesight perhaps melancholy makes me  See that which is not  Bapt  It is too apparent  I grieve to look upon't besides the yellow  That does assure she's tempted there are lines  Of a dark colour that disperse themselves  O'er every miniature of her face and those  Confirm  Math  She is turn'd whore  Bapt  I must not say so  Yet as a friend to truth if you will have me  Interpret it in her consent and wishes  She's false but not in fact yet  Math  Fact Baptista  Make not yourself a pander to her looseness  In labouring to palliate what a vizard  Of impudence cannot cover Did e'er woman  In her will decline from chastity but found means  To give her hot lust full scope It is more  Possible in nature for gross bodies  Descending of themselves to hang in air  Or with my single arm to underprop  A falling tower nay in its violent course  To stop the light'ning than to stay a woman  Hurried by those two furies Lust and Falshood  In her full career to wickedness  Bapt  Pray you temper  The violence of your passion  Math  In extremes  Of this condition can it be in man  To use a moderation I am thrown  From a steep rock headlong into a gulph  Of misery and find myself past hope  In the same moment that I apprehend  That I am falling And this the figure of  My idol few hours since while she continued  In her perfection that was late a mirror  In which I saw miraculous shapes of duty  Staid manners with all excellency a husband  Could wish in a chaste wife is on the sudden  Turn'd to a magical gla  and does present  Nothing but horns and  ror  Bapt  You may yet  And 'tis the best foundation build up comfort  On your own goodness  Math  No that hath undone me  For now I hold my temperance a sin  Worse than excess and what was a vice a virtue  Have I refus'd a queen and such a queen  Whose ravishing beauties at the first sight had tempted  A hermit from his beads and chang'd his prayers  To amorous sonnets to preserve my faith  Inviolate to thee with the hazard of  My death with torture since she could inflict  No less for my contempt and have I met  Such a return from thee I will not curse thee  Nor for thy falshood rail against the sex  'Tis poor and common I'll only with wise men  Whisper unto myself howe'er they seem  Nor present nor past times nor the age to come  Hath heretofore can now or ever shall  Produce one constant woman  Bapt  This is more  Than the satyrists wrote against 'em  Math  There's no language  That can express the poison of these aspicks  These weeping crocodiles and all too little  That hath been said against 'em But I'll mould  My thoughts into another form and if  She can outlive the report of what I have done  This hand when next she comes within my reach  Shall be her Executioner  The fiction of the PICTURE being first allowed the most rigid Critick will I doubt not confess that the workings of the human heart are accu∣rately set down in the above scene The play is not without many others equally excellent both before and after it nor in those days when the Power of Magick was so generally believed that the severest laws were solemnly enacted against Witches and Witchcraft was the fiction so bold and extravagant as it may seem at present Hoping that the reader may by this time be some∣what reconciled to the story or even interested in it I will venture to subjoin to the long extracts I have already made from this play one more speech where  the  PICTURE is mentioned very beau∣tifully Mathias addresses himself to the Queen in these words  Math  To slip once  I  incident and excus'd by human frailty  But to fall ever damnable We were both  Guilty I grant in tendering our affection  But as I hope you will do I repented  When we are grown up to ripeness our life is  Like to this Picture While we run  A constant race in goodness it retains  The just proportion But the journey being  Tedious and sweet temptations in the way  That may in some degree divert us from  The road that we put forth in e'er we end  Our pilgrimage it may like this turn yellow  Or be with blackness clouded But when we  Find we have gone astray and labour to  Return unto our neverfailing guide  Virtue contrition with unfeigned tears  The spots of vice wash'd off will soon restore it  To the first pureness  The several passages will I hope be thought by the judicious Reader to be written in the free vein of a true Poet as well as by the exact hand of a faithful Disciple of Nature If any of the above arguments or rather the uncommon excellence of the great Writers themselves can induce the Critick to allow the Excursions of Fancy on the Theatre let him not suppose that he is here advised to sub∣mit to the Perversion of Nature or to admire those who overleap the modest bounds which she has pre∣scribed to the Drama I will agree with him that Plays wherein the truth of Dramatick Character  is violated can convey neither Instruction nor De∣light Shakespeare Jonson Beaumont and Fletcher Massinger c are guilty of no such violation In∣deed the heroick nonsense which overruns the Theatrical Productions of Dryden  Nobody can have a truer veneration for the Poetical Genius of  Dryden  than the Writer of these Reflections but surely that Genius is no where so much obscured notwithstanding some transient gleams as in his Plays of which he had himself no great opinion since the only plea he ever urged in their favour was that the town had ever received with applause Plays  equally bad  Nothing perhaps but the notion of Heroick Plays could have carried the immediate successors to the Old Class of Writers into such ridiculous contradictions to na∣ture That I may not appear singular in my opinion of  Dryden  's Dramatick Pieces I must beg leave to refer the Reader to  the Ramb∣ler  No where that judicious Writer has produced divers instances from  Dryden  's Plays  sufficient  to use  the Rambler  's own language  to awaken the most torpid risibility  Howard and the other illustrious Prototypes of Bayes in the Re∣hearsal must nauseate the most indulgent spectator The temporary rage of false taste may perhaps betray the injudicious into a foolish admiration of such extravagance for a short period But how will these Plays stand the blunt of critical indignation when the personages of the Drama are found to resemble no character in nature except perhaps the dis∣ordered inhabitants of Bedlam  If then it must be confessed both from reason and experience that we cannot only endure but attend with pleasure to Plays which are almost merely Dramatick Representations of romantick Novels it will surely be a further inducement to recur to the works of our Old Writers when we find among them many pieces written on a severer plan a plan more accommodated to real life and approaching more nearly to the modern usage The Merry Wives of Windsor of Shakespeare the Fox the Alchymist the Silent Woman Every Man in his Humour of Jonson the New Way to pay Old Debts the City Madam of Massinger c c all urge their claim for a rank in the ordinary course of our WinterEvening Entertainments not only clear of every objection made to the abovemention∣ed species of Dramatick Composition but adhering more strictly to ancient rules than most of our later comedies  In point of character perhaps the most essential part of the Drama our Old Writers far transcend the Moderns It is surely needless in support of this opinion to recite a long list of names when the memory of every reader must suggest them to himself The manners of many of them it is true  do not prevail at present What then Is it dis∣pleasing or uninstructive to see the manners of a for∣mer age pass in review before us Or is the mind undelighted at recalling the Characters of our An∣cestors while the eye is confessedly gratified at the sight of the Actors drest in their Antique Habits Moreover Fashion and Custom are so perpetually fluctuating that it must be a very accurate piece in∣deed and one quite new and warm from the anvil that catches the Damon or Cynthia of this minute Some Plays of our latest and most fashionable Au∣thors are grown as obsolete in this particular as those of the first Writers and it may with safety be affirmed that Bobadil is not more remote from mo∣dern Character than the everadmired and every∣wheretobemetwith Lord Foppington It may also be further considered that most of the best Characters in our old Plays are not merely fugitive and temporary They are not the sudden growth of yesterday or today sure of fading or withering tomorrow but they were the delight of past ages still continue the admiration of the present and to use the language of true Poetry  To ages yet unborn appeal  And latest time th' ETERNAL NATURE feel  LLOYD'S ACTOR  There is one circumstance peculiar to the Dra∣matick Tales and to many of the more regular Co∣medies of our Old Writers of which it is too little to say that it demands no apology It deserves the highest commendation since it hath been the means of introducing the most capital beauties into their compositions while the same species of excellence could not possibly enter into those of a later period I mean the poetical stile of their dialogue Most nations except our own have imagined mere prose which with Moliere's  Bourgeois Gentilhomme  the meanest of us have talked from our cradle too little elevated for the language of the Theatre Our neighbours the French at this day write most of their Plays Comedies as well as Tragedies in rhyme a Gothick practice which our own stage once admitted but long ago wisely rejected The Grecian Iambick was more happily conceived in the true spirit of that elegant and magnificent simpli∣city which characterized the taste of that nation Such a measure was well accommodated to the ex∣pressions of the mind and though it refined indeed on nature it did not contradict it In this as well as in all other matters of literature the usage of Greece was religiously observed at Rome Plautus  in his richest vein of humour is numerous and po∣etical The Comedies of Terence though we can∣not agree to read them after Bishop Hare were evi∣dently not written without regard to measure which is the invincible reason why all attempts to render them into downright prose have always proved and ever must prove unsuccessful and if a faint effort now under contemplation to give a version of them in familiar blank verse after the manner of our Old Writers but without a servile imitation of them should fail it must I am confi∣dent be owing to the lameness of the execution The English heroick measure or as it is commonly called blank verse is perhaps of a more happy construction than even the Grecian Iambick ele∣vated equally but approaching nearer to the lan∣guage of nature and as well adapted to the expres∣sion of Comick Humour as to the Pathos of Tragedy  The mere modern Critick whose idea of blank verse is perhaps attached to that empty swell of phraseology so frequent in our late Tragedies may consider these notions as the effect of bigotry to our old authors rather than the result of impartial criticism Let such an one carefully read over the works of those writers for whom I am an advo∣cate  There he will seldom or ever find that tu∣mour of blank verse to which he has been so much accustomed He will be surprised with a familiar dignity which though it rises somewhat above or∣dinary conversation is rather an improvement than perversion of it He will soon be convinced that blank verse is by no mens appropriated solely to the buskin but that the hand of a master may mould it to whatever purposes he pleases and that in comedy it will not only admit humour but heighten and embellish it Instances might be pro∣duced without number It must however be la∣mented that the modern Tragick Stile free in∣deed from the mad flights of Dryden and his co∣temporaries yet departs equally from nature I am apt to think it is in great measure owing to the al∣most total exclusion of blank verse from all modern compositions Tragedy excepted The common use of an elevated diction in comedy where the writer was often of necessity put upon expressing the most ordinary matters and where the subject demanded him to paint the most ridiculous emotions of the mind was perhaps one of the chief causes of that  easy vigour  so conspicuous in the style of the old tragedies Habituated to poetical dialogue in those  compositions wherein they were obliged to adhere more strictly to the simplicity of the language of nature the Poets learnt in those of a more raised species not to depart from it too wantonly They were well acquainted also with the force as well as elegance of their mothertongue and chose to use such words as may be called natives of the lan∣guage rather than to harmonise their verses and agonise the audience with Latin terminations Whether the refined style of Addison's Cato and the flowing versification of Rowe first occasioned this departure from ancient simplicity it is difficult to de∣termine But it is too true that Southern was the last of our Dramatick Writers who was in any de∣gree possest of that magnificent plainness which is the genuine dress of nature though indeed the plays even of Rowe are more simple in their style than those which have been produced by his succes∣sors It must not however be dissembled in this place that the style of our Old Writers is not with∣out faults that they were apt to give too much into conceits that they often pursued an allegorical train of thought too far and were sometimes be∣trayed into forced unnatural quaint or gigantick expressions In the works of Shakespeare himself  every one of these errors may be found yet it may be safely asserted that no other Author antient or modern has expressed himself on such a variety of subjects with more ease and in a vein more truly poetical unless perhaps we should except Homer Of which by the bye the deepest Critick most conversant with idioms and dialects is not quite a competent judge  I would not be understood by what I have here said of Poetical Dialogue to object to the use of Prose or to insinuate that our modern Comedies are the worse for being written in that style It is enough for me to have vindicated the use of a more elevated manner among our Old Writers I am well aware that most parts of Falstaff Ford Benedick Malvolio c are written in prose nor indeed would I counsel a modern Writer to attempt the use of Poetical Dialogue in a mere Comedy A Dramatick Tale indeed chequered like life it∣self with various incidents ludicrous and affecting if written by a masterly hand and somewhat more severely than those abovementioned would I doubt not still be received with candour and applause The Publick would be agreeably surprised with the revival of Poetry on the Theatre and the oppor∣tunity  of employing all the best performers serious as well as comick in one piece would render it still more likely to make a favourable impression on the audience There is a gentleman not unequal to such a task who was once tempted to begin a piece of this sort but I fear he has too much love of ease and indolence and too little ambition of literary fame ever to complete it  But to conclude  Have I Sir been wasting all this ink and time in vain Or may it be hoped that you will extend some of that care to the rest of our Old Authors which you have so long bestowed on Shakespeare and which you have so often lavished on many a worse Writer than the most inferior of those here recommended to you It is certainly your interest to give variety to the Publick Taste and to diver∣sify the colour of our Dramatick Entertainments Encourage new attempts but do justice to the old The Theatre is a wide field Let not one or two walks of it alone be beaten but lay open the whole to the Excursions of Genius This perhaps might kindle a spirit of originality in our modern Writers for the Stage who might be tempted to aim at more novelty in their compositions when the liberality of the popular taste rendered it less  hazardous That the narrowness of Theatrical Criticism might be enlarged I have no doubt Re∣flect for a moment on the uncommon success of Romeo and Juliet and Every Man in his Humour and then tell me whether there are not many other Pieces of as antient a date which with the like proper curtailments and alterations would produce the same effect Has an industrious hand been at the pains to scratch up the dunghill of Dryden's Am∣phitryon for the few pearls that are buried in it and shall the rich treasures of Beaumont and Fletcher Jonson and Massinger lie as it were in the ore untouched and disregarded Reform your List of Plays In the name of Burbage Taylor and Bet∣terton I conjure you to it Let the veteran Criticks once more have the satisfaction of seeing The Maid's Tragedy Philaster King and no King c on the StageRestore Fletcher's Elder Brother to the rank unjustly usurped by Cibber's Love Makes a Man and since you have wisely desisted from giv∣ing an annual affront to the City by acting The London Cuckolds on LordMayor's Day why will you not pay them a compliment by exhibiting The City Madam of Massinger on the same occasion  If after all sir these remonstances should prove without effect and the merit of these great Au∣thors  should plead with you in vain I will here fairly turn my back upon you and address myself to the Lovers of Dramatick Compositions in gene∣ral They I am sure will peruse those Works with pleasure in the closet though they lose the satisfaction of seeing them represented on the stage Nay should they together with you concur in de∣termining that such Pieces are unfit to be acted you as well as they will I am confident agree that such Pieces are at least very worthy to be read There are many modern Compositions seen with delight at the Theatre which sicken on the taste in the perusal and the honest Country Gentle∣man who has not been present at the representation wonders with what his London friends have been so highly entertained and is as much perplexed at the Townmanner of writing as Mr Smith in The Rehearsal The Excellencies of our Old Writers are on the contrary not confined to Time and Place but always bear about them the Evidences of true Genius  Massinger is perhaps the least known but not the least meritorious of any of the old class of Writers His Works declare him to be no mean proficient in the same school He possesses all the beauties and  blemishes common to the Writers of that age He has like the rest of them in compliance with the Custom of the Times admitted Scenes of a low and gross nature which might be omitted with no more prejudice to the Fable than the Buffoonry in Venice Preserved For his few faults he makes ample atonement His Fables are most of them af∣fecting his Characters well conceived and strongly supported and his Diction flowing various ele∣gant and manly His two Plays revived by Bet∣terton The Bondman and the Roman Actor are not I think among the number of the best The Duke of Milan The Renegado The Picture The Fatal Dowry The Maid of Honour A New Way to pay Old Debts The Unnatural Combat The Guardian The City Madam are each of them in my mind more excellent He was a very popular Writer in his own times but so unaccountably as well as unjustly neglected at present that the accurate Compilers of a Work called The Lives of the Poets published under the learned name of the late Mr Theophilus Cibber have not so much as mentioned him He is how∣ever take him for all in all an Author whose Works the intelligent Reader will peruse with Ad∣miration And that I may not be supposed to with∣draw  my plea for his admission to the modern Stage I shall conclude these Reflections with one more Specimen of his Abilities submitting it to all Judges of Theatrical Exhibitions whether the most masterly Actor would not here have an opportunity of displaying his Powers to Advantage  The Extract I mean to subjoin is from the last scene of the first act of The Duke of MilanSforsa having espoused the cause of the King of France against the Emperor on the King's defeat is advised by a friend to yield himself up to the Emperor's discretion He consents to this mea∣sure but provides for his departure

mistake at the Press owing in great measure to the absence of the Author while this part of the work was printing the running title of "  Prose on several Occasions  " intended only for the miscellaneous Letters and Papers has been continued to these "  Critical Reflec∣tions on our Old English Writers  "  PREFACE TO THE WORKS OF BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER  PUBLISHED IN THE YEAR  PREFACE TO THE WORKS OF BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER  CONSIDERING the acknowledged excel∣lence of our Authors loudly acknowledged by the most eminent of their contemporaries and successors it appears at first sight rather wonderful that in the space of a hundred and fifty years which have elapsed since the death of these Poets no more than three complete editions of their Works have been published we say three because the first folio professedly included no more of their Plays than those which had not before been singly printed in quarto  To what causes are we to attribute this amazing disparity between the reputation of the Writers and the publick demand for their productions Are libraries furnished with books as apartments with furniture according to the fashion or is it necessary because plays were originally written to  be acted that they must continue to be perpetually represented or cease to be read  Truth we fear obliges us to confess that these questions must without much qualification be answered in the affirmative Shakespeare admira∣ble as he is certainly owes some part of his present popularity and the extraordinary preference given to his plays beyond those of all our other dramatists to the mode adopted by the literary world to extol him By the changes of fashion Nature and right reason sometimes come into vogue but the multitude take them like coin because they are in currency while men of sense and letters alone appreciate them according to their intrinsick value and receive merit wherever they find it as bul∣lion though it has not the stamp of fashion im∣pressed on it To such men the genius of Shake∣speare instead of obscuring illustrates the kindred talents of Beaumont and Fletcher Yet such men are but rare and one of the most acute and learned editors of Shakespeare speaking of his own notes  "concerned in a critical explanation of the author's beauties and defects but chiefly of his beauties whether in stile thought sentiment  character or composition"  adds that  "the publick judgment hath less need to be assisted in what it shall  reject  than in what it ought to PRIZE Nor is the value they set upon a work a certain proof that they understand it  For it is ever seen  THAT HALF A DOZEN VOICES OF CREDIT GIVE THE LEAD  and if the public chance to be in good humour or the author much in their favour  THE PEOPLE ARE SURE TO FOLLOW"  To the popularity of a Dramatick Writer no∣thing more immediately contributes than the fre∣quency of theatrical representation Common readers like barren spectators know little more of an author than what the actor not always his happiest commentator presents to them Mutila∣tions of Shakespeare have been recited and even quoted as his genuine text and many of his dramas not in the course of exhibition are by the multitude not honoured with a perusal On the stage indeed our Authors formerly took the lead Dryden having informed us that in his day two of their plays were performed to one of Shakespeare The stage however owes its attrac∣tion to the actor as well as author and if the able performer will not contribute to give a polish and  brilliancy to the work it will lie like the rough diamond obscured and disregarded The artists of former days worked the rich mine of Beaumont and Fletcher and Betterton the Roscius of his age enriched his catalogue of characters from their Dramas as well as those of Shakespeare Unfortunately for our Authors the Roscius of our day confined his round of characters in old plays too closely to Shakespeare We may almost say of him indeed in this respect as Dryden says of Shakespeare's scenes of magick  Within that circle none durst walk but he  but surely we must lament that those extraordinary powers which have so successfully been exerted in the illustration of Shakespeare and sometimes prostituted to the support of the meanest writers should not more frequently have been employed to throw a light upon Beaumont and Fletcher Their Plays we will be bold to say have the same excellencies as well as the same defects each perhaps in an inferior degree with the Dramas of their great master Like his they are built on histories or novels pursuing in the same manner the story through its various circumstances like his but not always with equal truth and nature their characters are boldly drawn and warmly  coloured like his their dialogue containing every beauty of style and licentiousness of construction is thick sown with moral sentiments interchanged with ludicrous and serious ribaldry and sublime and sometimes enlivened with wit in a richer vein than even the immortal dramas of Shakespeare In Comedy the criticks of their own days and those immediately succeeding gave Beaumont and Fletcher the preference to Shakespeare and although the slow award of time has at length justly decreed the superior excellence of the glo∣rious father of our drama beyond all further ap∣peal yet these his illustrious followers ought not surely to be cast so far behind him as to fall into contemptuous neglect while the most careless works of Shakespeare are studiously brought forward The Maid's Tragedy King and No King Love's Pilgrimage Monsieur Thomas  c c c  would hardly disgrace that stage which has exhibited The Two Gentlemen of Verona  Mr Seward has employed great part of his Pre∣face in citing similar passages from Shakespeare and our Authors and though we do not entirely agree with him in the comparisons he has drawn we cannot resist the temptation of adducing one in∣stance  in our opinion more to the advantage of our Authors than any mentioned in that Preface It is the entire character of the boy HENGO in the Tragedy of Bonduca a character whch is we think taken altogether better sustained and more beautifully natural and pathetick than the Prince Arthur of Shakespeare The scene in King John between Arthur and Hubert excellent as it is almost passes the bounds of pity and terror and becomes horrible besides which Shakespeare to whom  "a quibble"  as Dr Johnson says  "was the fatal Cleopatra for which he lost the world and was content to lose it"  has enervated the dialogue with many frigid conceits which he has with more than usual impropriety put into the mouth of the innocent Arthur while he is pleading most affectingly for mercy  As for example  Will you put out mine eyes  These eyes that never did nor never shall  So much as frown on you  Hub  I've sworn to do it  And with hot irons must I burn them out  Arth  Ah none but in this iron age would do it  The iron of itself tho' heat red hot  Approaching near these eyes would drink my tears  And quench its fiery indignation  Even in the matter of mine innocence  Nay after that consume away in rust  But for containing fire to harm mine eye  Are you more stubbornhard than hammer'd iron  Oh if an angel should have come to me  And told me Hubert should put out mine eyes  I would not have believ'd him no tongue but Hubert's  And again  Go to hold your tongue  Arth  Hubert the utterance of a brace of tongues  Must needs want pleading for a pair of eyes  Let me not hold my tongue let me not Hubert  Or Hubert if you will cut out my tongue  So I may keep mine eyes Oh spare mine eyes  Tho' to no use but still to look on you  Lo by my troth the instrument is cold  And would not harm me  Hub  I can heat it boy  Arth  No in good sooth  the fire is dead with grief  Being create for comfort to be us'd  In undeserv'd extremes see else yourself  There is no malice in this burning coal  The breath of Heaven hath blown its spirit out  And strew'd repentant ashes on its head  Hub  But with my breath I can revive it boy  Arth  And if you do you will but make it blush  And glow with shame of your proceedings Hubert  Nay it perchance will sparkle in your eyes  And like a dog that is compell'd to fight  Snatch at his master that doth tarre him on  All things that you should use do me wrong  Deny their office only you do lack  That mercy which fierce fire and iron extend  Creatures of note for mercylacking uses  The Reader we imagine will concur in our dis∣approbation of the passages printed in Italicks Between Caratach and Hengo we do not remember that a line occurs affected or unnatural and no∣thing can be more exquisitely tender than the several scenes between them The whole play abounds with Dramatick and Poetick Excellence  Allowing however freely allowing the ge∣neral superiority of Shakespeare to Beaumont and Fletcher and indeed to all other poets Homer per∣haps only excepted yet we cannot so far degrade our Authors as to reduce the most excellent of their pieces to a level with the meanest effusions of Shakespeare nor can we believe that there are not many of their longneglected Dramas that might not with very inconsiderable variations be accom∣modated to the taste of a modern audience The  Publick have been long habituated to the phrase∣ology of Shakespeare whose language in the opinion of Dryden is a little obsolete in compari∣son of that of our Authors and irregularities of fable have been not only pardoned but defended When the great English Actor of whom we have been speaking first undertook the direction of the stage his friend the present Laureat boldly told him  A nation's taste depends on you  The national taste under his happy influence acquired from day to day from year to year an encreased relish for Shakespeare and it is almost matter of amazement as well as concern that so little of his attention was directed to those Dra∣matick Writers whose poetical character bore so great an affinity to the just object of his admira∣tion A deceased actor of great merit and still greater promise very successfully opened his the∣atrical career by appearing in the tragedy of Philaster At the same time the same tragedy contributed not a little to the growing fame of one of our principal actresses That play the Two Noble Kinsmen and some other pieces of Beau∣mont and Fletcher besides those we have already enumerated would undoubtedly become favourite  entertainments for the stage if the theatrical ta∣lents of the performers bore any kind of propor∣tion to the dramatick abilities of the writers Since the directors of our theatres in some sort hold the keys of the Temple of Dramatick Fame let them do honour to themselves by throwing open their doors to Beaumont and Fletcher Seeing there are at present but small hopes of emulating the tran∣scendent actor who so long and so effectually im∣pressed on our minds the excellence of Shake∣speare let them at least rescue their performers from an immediate comparison so much to their disadvantage by trying their force on the charac∣ters of our Authors The Two Noble Kinsmen indeed has been ascribed falsely as we think to Shakespeare  "The Two Noble Kinsmen says Pope if that play be his  as there goes a tradi∣tion  it was and indeed  it has little resemblance of Fletcher  and more of our author than some of those which have been received as genuine"  Unhappy Poets whose very excellence is turned against them Shakespeare's claim to any share in the Two Noble Kinsmen we have considered at the end of that piece to which we refer the Reader In this place we shall only enter our protest against  the authority of Pope who appears to have felt himself mortified and ashamed when he  "dis∣charged the dull duty of an Editor"  He surely must be allowed to discharge his duty with re∣luctance and most probably with neglect who speaks of it in such terms In his Preface indeed he has with a most masterly hand drawn the out∣line of the poetical character of Shakespeare but in that very Preface by a strange perversion of taste he proposes to throw out of the list of Shake∣speare's plays The Winter's Tale which he con∣siders as spurious On no better foundation we think has he asserted that the play of the Two Noble Kinsmen  has little resemblance of Fletcher  "There goes a tradition"  that  Garth did not write his own Dispensary    "there goes a tradition"  that the admirable translator of Homer like Shakespeare himself had  little Latin and less Greek  but what candid critick would countenance such a tradition And is such a vague blind playhouse tradition a sufficient warrant for one great poet to tear the laurel from the brows of another  The modern editors of Shakespeare contemplate with admiration that indifference to future fame which suffered him to behold with uncommon  apathy some of his pieces incorrectly printed dur∣ing his life without attempting to rescue them from the hands of barbarous editors or preparing for posterity a genuine collection of his Works supervised and corrected by himself In our opinion the Dedication and Preface of Heminge and Con∣dell more than insinuate the intention of Shake∣speare had he survived to have published such a collection  We hope that they outliving him and he not having the fate common with some to be Exequutor to his own writings c  Dedication of Shakespeare's Works by Heminge and Condell  It had been a thing we confesse worthy to have been wished  that the Author himself had lived to have set forth and over∣seene his own writings but since it has been ordained otherwise and he by death departed from that right  we pray you doe not envy his friends the office of their care and paine to have collected and published them  Preface of Heminge and Condell  But be that as it may his sup∣posed carelessness concerning the fate of his pieces after they had been represented is not so very singular many of the plays of Beaumont and Fletcher also having been inaccurately printed from stolen copies during the lives of the Authors and the remainder collected some years after their deaths like the Works of Shakespeare by the players Ben Jonson appears to have been the only  dramatick Poet of that age who paid any attention to the publication of his own Compositions  The old quarto copies of Beaumont and Fletcher have come down to us exactly in the same state with the old quartos of Shakespeare The printers of those times not only copied but multiplied the errors of the transcriber An Editor nay even a corrector of the press seems to have been a character of which they had not the smallest conception Even the titlepages appear to exhibit the very names of the Authors at random sometimes announcing the play as the work of one Poet sometimes of another and sometimes as the joint production of both A Bookseller is somewhere introduced as reprehending  the saving ways of an Odewriter  who he supposed merely to lengthen his work would often put no more than three or four words into a line The old printers seem to have con∣ceived the same idea of the parsimony of Poets and therefore often without scruple run verse into prose not adverting to measure or harmony but solely governed by the dimensions of the page whether divided into columns or carried all across from one scanty margin to another Their orthography  Their orthography  c To this article our ancestors seem to have afforded very little attention  Ingenions  for  ingenuous alter  for  altar cozen  for  cousin desert  for  defart talents  for  talons then  for  than  c c continually occur in the old books Nor does there seem to have been any greater regard paid to proper names one of our Poets for instance we find called  Fleatcher Flecher  and  Fletcher  and the other  Beamont Beamount  and  Beaumont  The name of  Shakespeare  is spelt at least a dozen ways We are told in the first note on the Dunciad of  "an  autograph  of  Shakespeare  himself whereby it appeared that he spelt his own name without the first  e  "  Yet even this  auto∣graph  is not decisive In the Registerbook at Stratford upon Avon the name of the family is regularly entered  Shakspere  In the Poet's own will which now lies in the PrerogativeOffice Doctor's Com∣mons his name is spelt THREE different ways In the body of the will it is always written  Shackspere  This however may be ascribed to the Lawyer The will consists of three sheets the first of which is legibly subscribed  Shackspere  the two others  Shakspeare  It must be acknowledged that the handwriting as well as situation of the first signature is different from that of the two following but it appears extraordinary that a stranger should attempt to falsify a sig∣nature which is usually ascribed to each sheet for the sake of giving authenticity to so solemn an instrument and is therefore always taken to be the handwriting of the testator Mr Garrick how∣ever had in his possession the lease of a house formerly situated in BlackFriars and but lately taken down on account of the new bridge which belonged to that Poet As a party to that lease he signs his name  Shakspeare  and the first syllable of his name is now pronounced in his native county Warwickshire with the short  a Sh̄ak  and not  Sh̄akespeare  On the other hand it must be confessed that the dialect of that county is more provincial than classical and we believe that all the families who are now known by the Poet's name both spell and pronounce it  Sh̄akespeare  which indeed seems most reconcilable to etimology if etimology be at all concern∣ed in so capricious a circumstance Many of the quartos published in his lifetime not only followed this mode of spelling but seemed nicely to mark the proper pronunciation by printing his name in the title page with a  Hyphen  between the two syllables that compose it thus SHAKESPEARE His cotemporary Jonson as well as Mil∣ton and Dryden his successors adhered to the same orthography Every thing however trivial interests an English reader from the relation it bears to that Great Poet which is the only excuse we have to offer for so long a note on a point of so little importance  is  so generally vicious and unsettled and their punc∣tuation so totally defective that the regulation of either rarely merits the triumphs that have so often been derived from it On the whole however these old copies of our Poets may by an intelligent Reader be perused with satisfaction The typo∣graphical errors are indeed gross and numerous but their very number and grossness keeps the reader awake to the genuine text and commonly  renders such palpable inaccuracies not prejudicial The genuine work of the Author is there extant though the lines are often like a confused multi∣tude huddled on one another and not marshalled and arrayed by the discipline of a modern Editor  The First Folio containing thirtyfour of our Author's pieces never till then collected or printed was published by the Players obviously transcribed  from the prompter's books commonly the most inaccurate and barbarous of all manuscripts or made out piecemeal from the detached parts copied for the use of the performers Hence it happens that the stagedirection has sometimes crept into the text and the name of the Actor is now and then substituted for that of the Character The transcribers knowing perhaps no Language per∣fectly corrupted all Languages and vitiated the dialogue with false Latin false French false Italian and false Spanish nay as Pope says of the old copies of Shakespeare  "their very Welch is false"  The Players however notwithstanding the censure of Pope  "yet from Cibber sore"  seem to have been at least with regard to our Poets as faithful and able editors as others of that period It is most natural to suppose that the Playhouse Manuscript contained the real Work of the Author though perhaps ignorantly copied and accommodated to the use of the Theatre A writer in his closet often silently acquiesces in the excellence of a continued Declamation but if at any time the Audience like Polonius cry out  "This is too long"  such passages are afterwards naturally curtailed or omitted in the representa∣tion  but the curious Reader being less  fastidious  "than the  proud  Spectator"  for in such terms Horace speaks of the Spectator is pleased with the restoration of these passages in print  "Players says Pope "are just such judges of what is  right  as tailors are of what is  graceful  "  The comparison is more ludicrous and sarcastick than it is just The Poet himself who makes the Cloaths may rather be called the Tailor Actors are at most but the empty beaux that wear them and the Spectators censure or admire them A Tailor however if players must be the Tailors though not equal in science to a Statuary or an Anatomist must yet be conceived to have a more intimate knowledge of the human form than a Blacksmith or a Capenter and if many of the actors know but little of the Drama they would probably have known still less of it had they not been retainers to the stage Some Improvements as well as Corruptions of the Drama may undoubtedly be derived from the Theatre Cibber  idle  Cibber wrote for the stage with more success than Pope Aeschylus Sophocles Plautus and Terence were soldiers and freedmen Shakespeare and Moliere were Actors  The Second Folio contained the first complete collection of the Works of Beaumont and Fletcher Concerning that edition we have nothing to add to what has been said by other Editors  The Octavo Editors of seemed to aim at little more than reprinting our Authors' Plays and giving a collection of them more portable and convenient than the Folios Their text however is more corrupt than that of either the quartos or folios the errors of which they religiously pre∣served adding many vicious readings of their own some of which have been combated in very long notes by their successors  In the year Theobald on the success and reputation of his Shakespeare projected an edition of the Works of Ben Jonson What he had executed of it fell into the hands of Mr Whalley and is inserted in that learned and in∣genious gentleman's edition At the same time he exhibited proposals for a publication of the Plays of Beaumont and Fletcher in which he was afterwards assisted by Mr Seward and Mr Sympson but Theobald dying before he had com∣mitted more than the first and about half the second volume to the press the undertaking was con∣tinued by the two lastmentioned gentlemen and  the edition thus jointly or rather severally exe∣cuted by Theobald Mr Seward and Mr Sympson at length appeared in the year These gen∣tlemen were the first Editors of our Poets who professed to collate the old copies to reform the punctuation and to amend the corruptions of the text Some attempts also were made to elucidate the obscurities and enforce the excellencies of their Authors How far we disagree or coincide with them will appear on inspection of the parti∣cular passages to which their several observations refer At present it will be sufficient to declare that we should have been inclined to entertain a more respectful opinion of their labours if they had not very early betrayed that confidence which every Reader is tempted to repose in an Editor not only by their carelessness but by the more un∣pardonable faults of faithlessness and misrepresenta∣tion Their reports of the state of the old copies can never safely be taken on trust and on examina∣tion many of those copies will appear to be both negligently collated and untruly quoted Their punctuation also notwithstanding their occasional selfapprobation is almost as inaccurate as that of the most antient and rude editions and their criti∣cal remarks have in our opinion oftener been well  intended than conceived Their work however has in the main conduced to the illustration of our Authors and we have seised every fair occasion to applaud the display of their diligence as well as the efforts of their critical acuteness and sagacity Such of their notes as appeared incontestible or even plausible we have adopted without remark to those more dubious we have subjoined additional annotations those of less consequence we have abridged and those of no importance we have omitted  In the present Edition it has been our chief aim to give the old text as it lies in the old books with no other variations but such as the Writers themselves had they superintended an impression of their Works or even a corrector of the press would have made Yet even these variations if at all important have not been made in silence Notes however have been subjoined to the text as briefly and as sparingly as possible but the lapse of time and fluctuation of language have rendered some Notes necessary for the purpose of explaining obsolete words unusual phrases old customs and obscure or distant allusions Critical remarks and conjectural emendations have been seldom hazard∣ed nor has any ridicule been wantonly thrown on  former Editors who have only sometimes been re∣prehended for pompous affectation and more fre∣quently for want of care and fidelity Every ma∣terial comment on these Plays has been retained in this Edition though often without the long and ostentatious notes that first introduced those com∣ments to the publick At the same time we have religiously attributed every observation critical or philological to its due author not wishing to claim any praise as Editors but by industriously endeavouring as an act of duty to collect from all quarters every thing that might contribute to il∣lustrate the Works of Beaumont and Fletcher  To conclude we have beheld with pity and indignation the mean parade of many modern Editors and we have endeavoured to fulfil their du∣ties without imbibing their arrogance We are perhaps too proud to indulge so poor a vanity at least we are too much occupied to litigate read∣ings we think of small importance and too honest to claim restorations not our own or to propose readings as corrections that are no more than re∣storations The Stationer has not disgraced our Authors with TobaccoPaper the Press we trust has done its duty and the RollingPress at a very considerable expence has added its  assistance The Cuts if we are not deceived are for the most part happily designed and well exe∣cuted and will probably be deemed an agreeable addition to the Work at least we may with truth assert that no authors in the English language published at the same price have so many and so valuable engravings  The province of a Painter and an Editor are directly opposite In the first instance the canvas receives its chief value from the artist and in the second the artist derives almost all his consequence from the canvas The Editor if he lives is car∣ried down the stream of time by his Author and if the Author be excellent and his commentary judicious  Still shall his little bark attendant sail  Pursue the triumph and partake the gale  For our parts we have been incited to this un∣dertaking from a real admiration of these Poets grounded as we apprehend on their genuine ex∣cellencies and a thorough persuasion that the Works of Beaumont and Fletcher may proudly claim a second place in the English Drama nearer to the first than the third to those of Shakespeare some of their Plays being so much in his manner that they can scarcely be distingushed to be the work of another hand  APPENDIX TO THE SECOND EDITION OF THE TRANSLATION OF THE COMEDIES OF TERENCE  PUBLISHED IN THE YEAR  APPENDIX TO THE SECOND EDITION OF THE TRANSLATION OF THE COMEDIES OF TERENCE  THE reverend and ingenious Mr Farmer in his curious and entertaining  Essay on the Learning of Shakespeare  having done me the honour to animadvert on some passages in the preface to this translation I cannot dismiss this edition with∣out declaring how far I coincide with that gentle∣man although what I then threw out carelessly on the subject of his pamphlet was merely inci∣dental nor did I mean to enter the lists as a champion to defend either side of the question  It is most true as Mr Farmer takes for granted that I had never met with the old comedy called  The Supposes  nor has it even yet fallen into my  hands yet I am willing to grant on Mr Farmer's authority that Shakespeare borrowed part of the plot of The Taming of the Shrew from that old translation of Ariosto's play by George Gascoign and had no obligations to Plautus I will accede also to the truth of Dr Johnson's and Mr Farmer's observation that the line from Terence exactly as it stands in Shakespeare is extant in Lilly and Udall's  Floures for Latin Speaking  Still however Shakespeare's total ignorance of the learned languages remains to be proved for it must be granted that such books are put into the hands of those who are learning those languages in which class we must necessarily rank Shakespeare or he could not even have quoted Terence from Udall or Lilly nor is it likely that so rapid a genius should not have made some further progress  "Our author says Dr Johnson as quoted by Mr Farmer had this line from Lilly which I mention that it may not be brought as an argu∣ment of his learning"  It is however an argu∣ment that he read Lilly and a few pages further it seems pretty certain that the author of  The Taming of the Shrew  had at least read Ovid from whose epistles we find these lines  Hàc ibat Simois hic est Sigeia tellus  Hic steterat Priami regia celsa senis  And what does Dr Johnson say on this occasion Nothing And what does Mr Farmer say on this occasion Nothing  In Love's Labour's Lost which bad as it is is ascribed by Dr Johnson himself to Shakespeare there occurs the word  thrasonical  another argument which seems to shew that he was not unacquainted with the comedies of Terence not to mention that the character of the Schoolmaster in the same play could not possibly be written by a man who had tra∣velled no further in Latin than  hic haec hoc  In Henry the Sixth we meet with a quotation from Virgil  Tantaene animis coelestibus irae  But this it seems proves nothing any more than the lines from Terence and Ovid in the Taming of the Shrew for Mr Farmer looks on Shake∣speare's property in the comedy to be extremely dis∣putable and he has no doubt but Henry the Sixth had the same author with Edward the Third which hath been recovered to the world in Mr Capell's Prolusions  If any play in the collection bears internal evi∣dence of Shakespeare's hand we may fairly give him  Timon of Athens  In this play we have a fami∣liar quotation from Horace  Ira furor brevis est  I will not maintain but this hemistich may be found in Lilly or Udall or that it is not in the  Palace of Pleasure  or the  English Plutarch  or that it was not originally foisted in by the players I  stands however in the play of  Timon of Athens  The world in general and those who purpose to comment on Shakespeare in particular will owe much to Mr Farmer whose researches into our old authors throw a lustre on many passages the ob∣scurity of which must else have been impenetrable No future Upton or Gildon will go further than North's translation for Shakespeare's acquaintance with Plutarch or balance between Dares Phrygius and  the Troye booke of Lydgate The Hystorie of Ham∣blet  in  black letter  will for ever supersede Saxo Grammaticus translated novels and ballads will perhaps be allowed the sources of Romeo Lear and the Merchant of Venice and Shakespeare him∣self however unlike Bayes in other particulars will  stand convicted of having  transversed  the prose of Holingshead and at the same time to prove  "that his  studies  lay in his own language"  the transla∣tions of Ovid are determined to be the production of Heywood  "That his  studies  were most demonstratively confined to  nature  and his  own language  "  I readily allow but does it hence follow that he was so de∣plorably ignorant of every other tongue living or dead that he only  "remembered perhaps enough of his  schoolboy  learning to put the  hig hag hog  into the mouth of Sir H Evans and might pick up in the writers of the time or the course of his conversation a familiar phrase or two of French or Italian"  In Shakespeare's plays both these last languages are plentifully scattered but then we are told they might be impertinent addi∣tions of the players Undoubtedly they might but there they are and perhaps few of the players had much more learning than Shakespeare  Mr Farmer himself will allow that Shakespeare began to learn Latin I will allow that his  studies  lay in English but why insist that he neither made any progress at school nor improved his acquisi∣tions there The general encomiums of Suckling  Denham Milton  c  on his  native genius  Mr Farmer closes these general testimonies of Shakespeare's hav  been only indebted to nature by saying  "He came out of her hand  some one else expresses it  like Pallas out of Jove's head at full gro  and mature"  It is whimsical enough that this  some one else  wh  expression is here quoted to countenance the general notion of Shakespeare's want of literature should be no other than myself Mr Farmer does  chuse to mention where he met with this expression of  some one else  some one else  does not chuse to mention where he dropt it  prove nothing and Ben Jonson's celebrated charge of Shakespeare's  small Latin and less Greek  In defence of the various reading of this passage given in the preface to the last edition of Shakespeare  "small Latin and  no  Greek"  Mr Farmer tells us that  "it was adopted above a century ago by W Towers in a panegyrick on Cartwright"  Surely Towers having said that Cartwright had  no  Greek is no proof that Ben Jonson said so of Shake∣speare  seem absolutely to decide that he had  some  knowledge of both and if we may judge by our own time a man who has any Greek is seldom without a very competent share of Latin and yet such a man is very likely to study Plutarch in English and to read translations of Ovid  POSTSCRIPT  THIS Appendix to the second Edition of the translation of Terence would not have had a place in this collection if it had not repeatedly appeared among the numerous  Prolegomena  to the late  Variorum  Editions of Shakespeare accompanied with Annotations which seem to require some notice  Mr Steevens in a Preface subjoined to that of Dr Johnson having first declared that  "the dispute about the learning of Shakespeare is now finally settled"  the reader is at the close of the copy of this Appendix referred to Dr Farmer's reply in a Note on Love's Labour's Lost Act II Sc ii p Edit of  The Note in question according to the custom of the Editors is rather long but I trust I shall do no  injustice to Dr Farmer's argument by selecting only his part of it  Dr Warburton is certainly right in his suppo∣sition that  Florio  is meant by the character of  Holofernes Florio  had given the first affront  "The plaies says he that they plaie in Eng∣land are neither  right comedies  nor  right tragedies  but representations of  histories  without any de∣corum"  The scraps of Latin and Italian are transcribed from his works particularly the pro∣verb about  Venice  which has been corrupted so much The  affectation of the letter  which  argues facilitie  is likewise a copy of his manner We meet with much of it in the sonnets to his patrons  In Italie your lordship well hath seene  Their manners monuments magnificence  Their language learnt in sound in stile in sense  Proving by profiting where you have  beene  To adde to forelearn'd facultie  facilitie  We see then the character of the Schoolmaster might be written with less learning than Mr Colman conjectured nor is the use of the word  thrasonical  any argument that the author had  read Terence It was introduced to our language long before Shakespeare's time Stanyhurst writes in a translation of one of Sir Thomas More's epigrams  Lynckt was in wedlocke a lofty  thrasonical  hufsnuffe  It can scarcely be necessary to animadvert any further upon what Mr Colman has ad∣vanced in the Appendix to his  Terence  If this gentleman at his leisure from modern plays will condescend to open a few old ones he will soon be satisfied that Shakespeare was obliged to learn and repeat in the course of his profession such Latin  Fragments  as are met with in his works The formidable one  ira furor brevis est  which is quoted from  Timon  may be found not in plays only but in every  tritical  essay from that of king  James  to that of dean  Swift  inclusive I will only add that if Mr Colman had previously looked at the panegyrick on  Cartwright  he could not so strangely have misrepresented my argument from it but thus it must ever be with the most ingenious men when they talk  without book  Let me however take this opportunity of acknow∣ledging the very genteel language which he has been pleased to use on this occasion  Mr Warton informs us in his Life of Sir  Thomas Pope  that there was an old play of  Ho∣lophernes  acted before the princess Elizabeth in the Year  FARMER  In the Edition of Shakespeare published in this Appendix again appears with the same reference to Dr Farmer's reply and the addition of the fol∣lowing Annotation on the last note in the Ap∣pendix  † It will appear still more whimsical that this  some one else  whose expression is here quoted may have his claim to it superseded by that of the late Dr Young who in his  Conjectures on Original Com∣position  p vol V Edit has the follow∣ing sentence  "An adult genius comes out of Na∣ture's hands as Pallas out of Jove's head at full growth and mature Shakespeare's genius was of this kind"  Where  some one else the first  may have intermediately dropped the contested expression I cannot ascertain but  some one else the second  tran∣cribed it from the author already mentioned  ANON  I flatter myself that my remarks on the subject of the Learning of Shakespeare and my idea of the extent of his literature were not extravagant and that I expressed myself in such terms as were not calculated to provoke censure or ridicule For my own part though I took no decided part in the ques∣tion I must confess that the wit and pleasantry of the replies and annotations have not materially al∣tered my opinion which the Editors would have more fairly submitted to their readers if Dr Far∣mer's reply had been given with the Appendix in∣stead of being transferred to another volume be∣cause some part of his observations related to a character of the play contained in it I must own too that I was rather surprised to see the Reverend Essayist whose remarks I had treated so respectfully making his reply as a flippant Annotator on another publication and rising from the bottom of the page of Love's Labour's Lost under the wing of that Editor whom in the second impression of his Essay he had styled  "  one of the first Criticks of the Age  who was pleased to declare on reading the former edition that THE QUESTION IS  now  FOR EVER DECIDED"  With what complacency these acute Criticks interchange flatteries and compliments and how freely do they throw out censures and sarcasms  upon others giving currency to each by annexing them to the popular text of Shakespeare  The Note of Dr Farmer referred to in the Ap∣pendix concerning  Shakespeare's small Latin and  LESS  Greek  in the first Edition of his Essay stands thus  This passage of  Ben Jonson  so often quoted is given us in the admirable preface to the late Edition with a various reading  "small Latin and  no  Greek"  which hath been held up to the Publick for a modern sophistication yet whether an error or not it was adopted above a Century ago by a Panegyrist on  Cartwright  On reading the above note I confess that I did not think it necessary to consult Towers's Panegy∣rick on Cartwright taking it for granted on the Essayist's note that Towers had applied the line to the subject of his panegyrick as Jonson had done before him and yet I cannot even after this frank concession account for Dr Farmer's triumph on so slight a misapprehension that does not at all affect the main question or establish the authority of the various reading The passage in the verses  of Towers prefixed to the works of Cartwright printed in runs thus  Thy skill in Wit was not so poorely meek  As theirs whose LITTLE Latin and NO Greek  Confin'd their whole discourse to a street phrase  Such dialect as their next neighbours was  From this quotation it will not only appear that I have at length consulted the panegyrick on Cart∣wright but that when  talking without book  I had  not so strangely misrepresented the Doctor's argument from it  His own note to the first edition of his Essay certainly tended to countenance the various reading of  "  small  Latin and  no  Greek"  by the adop∣tion of the line by Towers His Comment on the Appendix implies either from my wilfulness or carelessness  a misrepresentation of his argument  but surely whether Towers applied the disputed line to Cartwright or his supposed Rivals in the Drama was of no real consequence though by the by his adoption contains more various readings than one and yet the testimony of Ben Jonson on which I grounded my opinion remains unimpeached On the whole then have not the Criticks  strangely mis∣represented  MY  argument  I give due praise to the ingenious but  anony∣mous  Annotator in the last edition of Shakespeare who has clearly proved that Dr Farmer transcribed his allusion to  Pallas  from Dr Younge and not from  some one else  The thought is obvious and might without improbability occur to different writers but the similarity of expression  "  at full growth and mature  "  proves beyond controversy from whence in the present instance the allusion was taken But after all what is that matter to the Learning of Shakespeare  On that subject I never engaged myself as a cham∣pion on either side of the question but having been in some sort forced into the dispute I cannot but seise every occasion to applaud the ingenuity as well as indefatigable industry of the  Variorum  Editors who in the same vein of argument may hereafter proceed to prove that Shakespeare could neither read nor write The almost illegible plate engraved after his handwriting will not perhaps convince every inspector that the poet did not write his name as his cotemporaries on the stage have handed it down to us though it differs not only from the recent orthography of the Editors  "those new tuners of accents"  as well as from the Stratford  Parish Register to which Mr Bell in the im∣pression from his Apollo Press has religiously adhered The  Latin  in his plays is still allowed to hold its place but we are told lest the reader should be dazzled by it that Shakespeare was obliged to  "read and repeat in the course of his profession such Latin Fragments as are found in his works"  And we are expected to embrace this opinion  Before his Poems inscribed in his own name to his noble Patron Southampton stand as a Motto two lines from Ovid as palpable as those in the Taming of the Shrew But perhaps it will at length be discovered that those Poems were not written by Shakespeare or if they were that the lines had before been prefixed to some other black lettered pamphlet of that age or at least that Ben Jonson in compassion to his illiterate friend suggested the Motto which the  Shakescene  of the times for so the witlings of the day favouring the old orthography called Shakespeare could not himself supply  In return for the  civilities  of the  Variorum  Editors I beg leave to propose a small emendation in their LIST OF PLAYS  altered from  SHAKESPEARE in which they have done me the honour of attributing  to me without any authority two alterations of the Midsummer Night's Dream Of the first it is true I attended the rehearsals at the express desire of Mr Garrick on his going abroad but the revival as I foretold failing of success the piece was by my advice reduced to two acts under the title of A Fairy Tale so that I was little more than a Godfather on the occasion and the Alterations like some of the  Variorum  Annotations should have been subscribed ANON  When Criticks make a lucky hit  Proud of a note of Sterling worth  Each gives his name as Sponsor  But when mean malice aims at Wit  Like Francis in King Hal the Fourth  Each cries  Anon Anon Sir  REMARKS OR SHYLOCK's REPLY TO THE SENATE OF VENICE  THERE are few passages in the plays of Shakespeare that have been more repeat∣edly the subject of critical animadversion than a part of Shylock's reply to the Duke and the Magnificos in the Merchant of Venice  The lines in question in the second folio which now lies before me run thus and the second folio is I believe in this instance an exact transcript of the first  Some men there are love not a gaping pigge  Some that are madde if they behold a cat  And others when the bagpipe sings i'th' nose  Cannot contain their urine for Affection  Maisters of passion swayes it to the moode  Of what it likes or loaths  Rowe the first modern Editor himself a Poet willing I suppose to preserve the poetical expression with no more violation of the text than what was necessary to reconcile it to sense and grammar gives as was his manner without quoting any authority the fifth and part of the sixth line thus  Masterless  passion sways it to the mood  Of what it likes or loaths  This reading conveying a clear idea without any great violence to the first impressions was received and adopted by Pope Theobald and Hanmer  Theobald however willing to support a proposed emendation of his ingenious assistant Dr Thirlby and at the same time to introduce a Comment of Warburton starts a difficulty concerning the rela∣tive  it  sways  it  which according to Rowe's read∣ing easily and necessarily refers to the word  Affec∣tion  in the line immediately preceding  Dr Thirlby's emendation consisted in a new mode of punctuation by which he thus adjusted the doubtful lines in the passage  And others when the bagpipe sings i'th' nose  Cannot contain their urine  For Affection  Master  of passion sways it to the mood  Of what it likes or loaths  Warburton with a refined commentary rejects the reading of Rowe preserves the old pointing but changes the number of the verb reading  sway  for  sways Affection  he interprets to be used for  sympathy  and we learn from the second edition of Dr Farmer's Essay on the Learning of Shakespeare that  Affection  in the sense of  sym∣pathy  was formerly  technical  and so used by Lord Bacon Sir Kenelm Digby and  many  other writers  Mr Steevens in his republication in of the twenty plays of Shakespeare first printed in quarto from a professed collation of four different copies of this play entitles the Drama "The Comical His∣tory of The Merchant of Venice" and exhibits the passage in question thus  Some men there are love not a gaping pig  Some that are mad if they behold a cat  And others when the bagpipe sings i'th' nose  Cannot contain their urine for Affection  Masters of passion swayes it to the mood  Of what it likes or loathes  Here the old pointing is preserved but the spelling is in general more modern than even that of the se∣cond folio which was indeed an earlier publication than two of the collated quartos  The word  Masters  is exactly conformable to our present orthography and this noun governing the verb that follows is the most material in the whole sentence so material indeed that in order to preserve it the Modern Editors while they embrace the punctuation of Thirlby make a still further devia∣tion from the old copies and changing the number of both noun and verb give the passage thus  For  Affections  Masters of passion  sway  it to the mood  Of what it likes OF loaths  This reading seems to have been suggested by Sir John Hawkins  Mr Malone converting the noun  Masters  into a verb and changing  it  into  our  reads thus  For Affection  Masters our  passion sways it to the mood  Of what c  The patient and laborious Capel who commenced his researches long before all the Editors since Han∣mer and yet suffered those Editors to anticipate and almost supersede his own publication the dili∣gent but tardy Capel adopts the punctuation of Thirlby and regulates the passage thus  For Affection  Mistress  of passion sways it to the mood  Of what it likes or loaths  Capel with his usual fidelity gives the rejected reading  "  Maisters of  "  at the bottom of the page and as it should seem from the principle established in his Introduction from the oldest quarto Of Capel the  Variorum  Editors take no notice  It is remarkable also that Theobald in his note reporting Thirlby's proposed emendation joins an asterisk to the word  Master  referring to another various reading or conjecture  Or  MISTRESS but whether this was the original suggestion of Thirlby or of himself it is not easy to determine In old books the mode of spelling the word  Mistress  often  approaches very near to the word  Maisters  in the text and Mr Steevens who reads  Masters  and for the sake of Grammatical Concordance changes  Af∣fection  to  Affections  yet quotes a passage from Othello which though produced with another intention yet countenances in this instance the reading of Capel  And though we have there a Substitute of most allowed sufficiency yet  Opinion  a  Sovereign  MIS∣TRESS of Effects throws a more safe voice on you  I must confess that I cannot discover on what principle all the Editors since Theobald and Han∣mer have followed the punctuation of Thirlby It is impossible I think for any reader accustomed to the manner of our old writers not to feel a cer∣tain harshness in the new regulation of the text or indeed to doubt for a moment that the old books gave the second line correctly as at that time spoken on the stage and originally written by the Author  Cannot contain their urine for Affection  I never heard excellent and very Shylock as he is Mack∣lin's full stop in the middle of this verse without a shock and the following words of the line not only soften the expression but are most easy and  natural We still apply the verb  affect  in the same sense that Shylock here uses the noun derived from it and the simple meaning of the line is that  "Others are  so affected  by the sound of the bagpipe that they cannot contain themselves"  The mode of  Affection  here signified granting the old text to be genuine must be  Sympathy  illustrated by an example opposed to those before enumerated and the opposition marked like the  hic ille  of the Latin by the words  some and others  though without the two last words of the line the contrast is less clear and the effect of the bap∣pipe might be a third instance of Antipathy Thirl∣by's punctuation and Rowe's reading each suppose  Affection  to signify both  Sympathy  and  Antipathy  Each Critick must be allowed to be ingenious some word or phrase or line expressive of an irre∣sistible influence over our  likings  and  loathings  for Shylock speaks of both as well as governing the verb  sways  is most certainly the grand  Desideratum  the one thing requisite to regulate and explain this difficult passage  The passage as it stands in the old books is evidently defective or corrupt or both and though  the reading  Mistress  for  Masters  may remedy the corruption and bring the noun and verb accord∣ing to the rules of Syntax to accord with each other still there remains an imperfection in the context which has driven the commentators as their last resource to a new mode of punctuation My own method may perhaps appear still more desperate but desperate diseases require desperate remedies and without some topical applications the case under consideration is confessedly incurable and I cannot well explain myself without some dis∣section I must beg leave therefore to give a brief analysis of Shylock's reply to the Duke who tells him that the court recommend lenity to Anthonio and expect a gentle answer from the prosecutorHis answer is to this effect  I have taken a solemn oath to exact the penalty on the Bond and deny me justice at your peril If you demand why I prefer a pound of flesh to three thousand ducats I answer  it is my humour  Or if that answer be unsatisfactory I add that there is an uncontroulable and unaccountable in∣fluence affecting the mind predominating so absolutely over the passions as to impell them in spite of reason and of will acting in some  men by  Antipathy  and in others by  Sympathy  There are instances of both I am an instance of Antipathy I abhor I hate An∣thonio and this Hatred this Antipathy is the only answer that I will or  can  give why I prefer a losing suit to a lucrative composition  This I take to be a fair abstract of Shylock's an∣swer who waving the  sic volo  with which he follows up his oath proceeds to defend his conduct by the example of other men subject like himself to the irresistible dominion of  Sympathy  and  An∣tipathy  On the whole therefore I conceive that the ori∣ginal punctuation should be maintained that the word  Maisters  in the old copies should be read  Mis∣tress  and that the imperfection in the sense accord∣ing to that reading arises from a line or two lost or dropt at the press in which the words  Sympathy  and  Antipathy  so congenial to the argument had most probably a place  To submit this opinion and the whole of my comment fairly to the reader I shall conclude these observations with a transscript of the whole speech from the second folio only introducing  in  another character  the variation of  Mistress  for  Maisters  together with one intercalary line meant like the day in Leapyear to complete the system and to convey the real meaning of the author His real words are now irrecoverable  The Duke concludes the address to Shylock in behalf of the Senate and himself with these words  We do expect a gentle answer Jew  Shylock's answer is as follows  I have possesst your Grace with what I purpose  And by our holy Sabbath have I sworne  To have the due and forfet of my bond  If you deny it let the danger light  Upon your Charter and your Cities freedome  You'l aske me why I rather choose to have  A weight of carrion flesh then to receive  Three thousand Ducats Ile not answer that  But say it is my humor Is it answered  What if my house be troubled with a Rat  And I be pleas'd to give ten thousand Ducates  To have it bain'd What are you answer'd yet  Some men there are love not a gaping pigge  Some that are madde if they behold a cat  And others when the bagpipe sings i'th' nose  Cannot contain their urine for affection  Sovereign Antipathy  or  Sympathy  Mistress  of passion swayes it to the moode  Of what it likes or loaths now for your answer  As there is no firme reason to be rendred  Why he cannot abide a gaping pigge  Why he a harmless necessary cat  Why he a woollen bagpipe but of force  Must yeeld to such inevitable shame  As to offend himself being offended  So can I give no reason nor I will not  More than a lodg'd hate and a certaine loathing  I beare Anthonio that I follow thus  A loosing suit against him Are you answered  If this exposition is not convincing and conclu∣sive it were in vain to add more arguments to en∣force it  Valeat quantum valere potest  The few faults in the punctuation of the old copy are so ob∣  ious that they cannot mislead the attentive reader but the defect in the construction without addition or alteration is irremoveable The last

memorable in the annals of English Literature as those of Bacon or Newton has among other smaller works bequeathed to poste∣rity a short tract entitled "Some Thoughts con∣cerning Education" In this tract containing many excellent remarks many instances of shrewd penetration and much valuable information he has avowed himself a declared enemy to Publick  Education which he considers as a sacrifice of inno∣cency to confidence concluding  "that it is im∣possible to keep a lad from the spreading conta∣gion if  you will venture him abroad  IN THE HERD and trust to chance or  his own inclination  for the choice of his company at school"  Who would not shrink at the thoughts of en∣countering so formidable an adversary armed at all points with strong natural Sense keen Observation Satire Humour and Argument for such weapons he has wielded and with such armour has he de∣fended himself on the subject now under considera∣tion directing all his attacks against the principle I have undertaken to defend Yet exercising that freedom of which he has himself given both the precept and example I venture to think for my∣self and in my turn to submit my thoughts to the Publick  Nullius addictus jurare in verba Magistri  Locke's  Thoughts on Education  though published in one continued series and split into sections according to the custom of the times is yet as the  dedication declares the mere substance of a corre∣spondence with a private friend and indeed may now fairly be resolved into three separate letters for the writer at three distinct periods reverts to the state of infancy and twice leads the babe through child∣hood to youth and manhood this may escape the observation of a cursory reader but to a fair and strict examiner is plain and obvious  The following remarks are like the tract on which they are founded somewhat loose and desul∣tory It is indeed very difficult to follow a writer who often resumes a subject that he seems to have dismissed yet order and method have been endea∣voured to be preserved as far as was possible under such circumstances No material part of the ques∣tion it is hoped remains unnoticed and it may be added with confidence that no argument has been intentionally misrepresented  Virtue Virtue and Wisdom  Locke justly considers as the basis of all good education They are indeed as necessary to the operations of the mind as health and vigour to the exertions of the body We will not therefore dispute on a selfevident proposition but rather endeavour to prove on the very principles  of the tract now before us that Publick Education is more conducive to the improvement of the under∣standing and less dangerous to the morals than Domestick Tuition  It must be obvious to every reader that Locke himself enters on the comparison with difficulty and diffidence  "I confess says he with great can∣dour both sides have their inconveniencies"  He then proceeds to a laboured invective against Gram∣mar Schools as unfavourable to the practice of vir∣tue  "And therefore says he in conclusion I cannot but prefer  breeding of a young gentleman at home in his father's sight under a governor  as much the best and safest way to the great and main end of education  where it can be had and is ordered as it should be  "  Perfection no doubt if attainable were much to be desired but alas Imperfection is the lot of all human undertakings and all we can effect is to follow that course which is liable to the least ob∣jection The excellence of Locke's plan is in his own opinion evidently hypothetical so that he is at last driven to acknowledge that  "what shall be resolved in the case must in a great measure be  left to the parents to be determined by their cir∣cumstances and conveniences"  All that Locke says of children while children that is while in a mere state of infancy is in gene∣ral well worth notice He seems to enter into all their little feelings with as much penetration and much less romance than Rousseau whose EMILE with all its merit and all its originality is in fact an ingenious amplification of Locke's work realis∣ing in himself the ideal character of the tutor or governor and in  Emile  the person of the pupil whom he takes up from his cradle and carries to his mar∣riage bed just as Locke advises on his return from Late Travel Rousseau's work however is not merely the little tract of Locke dilated and personi∣fied but in many instances a comment sometimes too laboured and refined and sometimes acute and plausible Few will agree with him that instruction must be delayed till the lessons can be attended with experiment or think it reasonable to refer their little students to the open volume of nature denying them the use of books maps globes and other helps which Locke recommends Most parents would think Locke's method of teaching Geography as prudent as it is simple and easy by shewing children first the figure and natural parts of the globe and  the imaginary and artificial lines afterwards but Rousseau despises such insufficient methods throws away maps and spheres and by his own example exhorts teachers to carry their scholars at different seasons to the top of a mountain to see the sun rise at Midsummer and at Christmas This appears ra∣ther extravagant but at the same time it may be thought that Rousseau properly censures Locke's maxim of  reasoning  with children which he truly says Locke himself appears so much embarrassed to defend With equal justice he reprobates Locke's method of recommending and encouraging LIBE∣RALITY  "constantly  taking care that the child loses nothing by it  "  Let all the instances he gives of  "such freeness continues Locke  be always repaid and with interest  and let him sensibly perceive that the kindness he shews to others is no bad husbandry for himself but that it brings a return of kindness both from those who receive it and those who look on"  This says Rousseau is to teach a child to be generous to appearance and in reality avaricious He reprehends also Locke's opi∣nion that  "the consideration of  spirits  ought to go before that of matter and body"  for what idea says he can a child entertain of a being incorporeal and immaterial  But the management of infants is not the chief object of these remarks Of the treatment of chil∣dren Locke speaks with fairness and candour but when they advance to maturer age his evident prejudice against Publick Education obscures that precision and depraves that liberality so remarkable in his other works  Locke while he so openly and severely censures Publick Education slurs over the defects of do∣mestick tuition yet his subject unavoidably leads him to point out some imperfections and particu∣larly the danger  from servants  to which might be added the too frequent hereditary taint of the mind from the master and mistress and the contagion of their friends and acquaintance The mischiefs of domestick indulgence cannot indeed be more strongly delineated than in the words of Locke himself  "  He that is not used to submit his will to the reason of others WHEN he is YOUNG will scarce hearken or submit to his own reason when he is of an age to make use of it And what a kind of a man such an one is like to prove is easie to foresee  "  "  These are oversights usually committed by those who seem to take the greatest care of their children's  education But if we look into the common manage∣ment of children we shall have reason to wonder in the great dissoluteness of manners which the world complains of that there an any footsteps at all left of virtue I desire to know what vice can be named which PARENTS AND THOSE ABOUT CHILDREN do not season them with and drop into them the seeds of as soon as they are capable to receive them I do not mean by the examples they give and the pat∣terns they set before them which is encouragement enough but that which I would take notice of here is the downright teaching them vice and actually putting them out of the way of virtue  "  He then proceeds to shew that they principle them with  violence re∣venge  and  cruelty  that  lying  and  equivocation  are put into their mouths and commended that the little ones are taught to be proud of their cloaths before they can put them on and tempted and en∣couraged to  intemperance  and  luxury  The section concludes with the following paragraph  "  I shall not dwell any longer on this subject much less run over all the particulars that would shew what pains are used to corrupt children and instill prin∣ciples of vice into them But I desire parents so∣berly to consider what irregularity or vice there is which children are not visibly taught and whether  it be not their duty and wisdom to provide them other instructions  "  The chief officer in Locke's household of private education is a Governour or Tutor  "and if you find it difficult says he to meet with such a tutor you are not to wonder"  His description of a Tutor is indeed chimerical Wisdom temperance tenderness diligence and discretion are the lead essential requisites in the character of Locke's governour Such a man as he delineates is scarce to be found and if found would hardly undertake the task assigned him  His  learning however  much or little is no great recommendation  "That a tutor should have  Latin and learning  with the reputation of sobriety every one expects and this generally is thought enough and is all parents look for But when such an one  has emptied out into his pupil all the Latin and logick he has brought from the University  will that furniture make him  a fine gentleman  Or can it be expected that he should be better bred better skilled in the world better principled in the grounds and foundations of true virtue and ge∣nerosity than his young  Tutor  is"  Such is the derision bestowed by Locke on the  scholarship  of a tutor and such is his constant con∣tempt of literature and erudition under the sneering denominations of  Latin and learning a deal of trash dry systems c  which appears very strange from a learned or as Locke styles himself a  bookish man  He not only gives the first place to  virtue  without "which no science polite learning or talents can be of value but much prefers  breeding  to learning His encomiums on this accomplishment are equal to any of Lord Chesterfield's Dissertations on the  Graces  It is indeed always difficult to fix a charge of partiality or incoherency on so cautious and ingenious a writer because he commonly concludes his remarks with some qualifying expressions which however rather seem to bring up the rear as a saving clause than to be intended to militate against the main argument As one instance among many others of these principles and this practice may be pro∣duced the following passage with which he winds up his recommendation of the first essential requisite in a Tutor  The Tutor therefore ought IN THE FIRST PLACE TO BE WELL BRED And a young gentleman who gets this ONE qualification from his GOVERNOR sets out with great advantage and will find that THIS  ONE ACCOMPLISHMENT will more open his way to him get him more friends and carry him farther in the world than all the HARD WORDS OR REAL KNOWLEDGE he has got from the liberal arts or his TUTOR'S learned ENCYCLOPOEDIA Not that those should be neglected but by no means preferred or suffered to thrust out the other  Knowledge of the world  also is deemed preferable to  learning  and  languages  though by the way he here inadvertently implies the superior force of Pub∣lick Education and is obliged to confess that the study of the antients contributes both to that  know∣ledge  and to  virtue  The Tutor however this sage and exemplary monitor described by Locke must enter his pupil into the world and at the same time preserve him like the Four Thieves Vinegar from the contagion of society so that a youth must it seems after all encounter the danger so much dreaded in a Publick Education the danger of herding with those of his own time of life and how ill he may be prepared to hazard his morals his health and his fortune in such company the following picture of many a lad mewed up in a private family drawn by the masterly hand of Locke himself will exhibit in the most lively colours  The longer he is kept thus hoodwinked the less he will see when he comes abroad into open daylight and be the more exposed to be a prey to himself and others And an old boy at his first appearance with all the gravity of his ivybush about him is sure to draw on him the eyes and chirping of the whole town volery Amongst which there will not be wanting some birds of prey that will presently be on the wing for him  The Tutor however is not to neglect our young master's learning but is to teach him Latin like French by  talking  it into him in constant conversa∣tion for he must be constantly with his pupil talk nothing else to him and make him still answer in the same language though perhaps the comparison is not quite fair and apposite French being a living language and Latin a dead one Grammar however is strictly forbidden by  Locke  as well as  Rousseau  And if the well bred tutor should be incapable a more agreeable teacher may be found and the fol∣lowing method is recommended to all private fa∣milies  Whatever stir there is made about getting of LATIN as the great and difficult business his mo∣ther may teach it him herself if she will but spend  two or three hours in a day with him and make him read the Evangelists in LATIN to her For she need but buy a LATIN Testament and having got some∣body to mark the last syllable but one where it is long in words above two syllables which is enough to regulate her pronunciation and accenting the words read daily in the GOSPELS and then let her avoid understanding them in LATIN if she can And when she understands the Evangelists in LATIN let her in the same manner read AESOP's FABLES and so proceed on to EUTROPIUS JUSTIN and other such books I do not mention this as an imagination of what I fancie may do but as of a thing I have known done and the LATIN Tongue with ease got this way  Supposing the Governor to be intelligent able and competent to the instruction of his pupil still the mother is not to lie idle for  "Care is to be taken whilst he is learning Foreign languages  by speak∣ing and reading nothing else with his tutor that he do not forget to read English  which may be pre∣served by his mother or somebody else hearing him read some chosen parts of scripture or other  English  book every day"  "Languages says Locke  being to be learnt by rote custom and memory  are then spoken in the greatest perfection when all rules of Grammar are utterly forsaken"  Languages may be  spoken  by  rote  but surely dead languages especially are not as Locke supposes to be learnt so and though an adept may throw away his Grammar and Dic∣tionary too if he pleases it is strange advice to a student In the lower classes of Publick Schools most of the boys are during the intervals of the school hours under the care of one of the assistants retained at a very moderate cost as a private tutor His method of teaching them to render English into Latin and so  vice versâ  is excellent though di∣rectly opposite to that recommended by Locke and in my opinion so much more excellent in proportion as it is more opposite To translate a portion of one of the gospels for the current week is a common exercise and to fit them for the execution of their task they are made to  parse  every word in the sen∣tence and by thus having learnt to what part of speech every one belongs together with the number case mood tense c their task is made easy and they acquire by degrees a  radical  knowledge of the two languages at once Locke's proposal of  talking  children into a language which he frequently contends  that nobody talks and should pretend to write is as little eligible as it is feasible and his substituted method of  interlining Latin and English  while it re∣quires according to his own confession a previous explanation of the various terminations of nouns and verbs their several genders cases numbers and persons proves the necessity of the rules of Grammar while it deprives the little students of the use of them The result must be perpetual con∣fusion arising from superficial instructions and a total impossibility of cultivating even their mother tongue as he afterwards very properly though in∣consistently with his own doctrine recommends English itself should be taught by Grammar though by natives first acquired by rote custom and me∣mory The mother tongue is almost sucked in with the mother's milk  Take a boy from the top of a Grammar school says Locke and one of the same age bred  as he should be  in his father's family and bring them into good company together and then see which of the two will have the more manly car∣riage and address himself with the more be∣coming assurance to strangers Here I  imagine  the school boy's confidence will either fail or  discredit him and  if it be such  as fits him only for the conversation of boys he were better be without it  This passage is quite of a piece with every other in which Locke mentions Publick Education on which occasion he not only as he himself confesses loses his temper but also drops his usual liberality and candour  "I cannot with patience think he cries in another place that a young gentleman should be put into the herd and be driven with a whip and scourge as if he were to run the gantlet through the different classes  ad capiendum ingenii cultum  "  At other times he terms such youths  ill bred and vicious boys a mixed herd of unruly boys learning to wrangle at trap or rook at shunfarthing practising wagferies and cheats and con∣certing well laid plots of robbing an orchard  The best and perhaps the most direct way of con∣futing these commonplace invectives were to pro∣duce from the same tract in which they have gained a place as evidences of the partiality of the writer other passages written when off his guard that directly contradict these assertions  There is often  says Locke on one of these oc∣casions  in people especially children a clownish shame facedness before strangers or those above them They are confounded in their thoughts words and looks and so lose themselves in that confusion as  to be able to do any thing or at least to do it with freedom and gracefulness which pleases and makes them acceptable  Plainness of manners is to a certain age perhaps the most ingenuous feature of youth A  polish  is the last stage of education as well as of arts and manufactures and when given too soon the varnish only hides a defect A boy should not have the manners nor the dress of a man Locke himself under the article of  manners  strongly reprobates the parents and tutors who teize their children about  putting off hats and making of legs  and justly con∣cludes that  "if their minds are well disposed and principled with inward civility a great part of the roughness which sticks to the outside for want of better teaching time and observation will rub off as they grow up if they are bred in good company"  To say the truth much of the security as well as improvement of youth depends on their not having attained the finished breeding of men And the raw diffidence of a school boy  would be ill exchanged for the pert confidence of many a homebred fopling The words of Rousseau on this head will better express my meaning and are an excellent contrast to the above passage from Locke  As there is an age proper for the study of the sciences there is also a sit age to catch the manners of the world  Comme il y a un age propre a l'etude des sciences il y en a un pour bien saisir l'usage du monde  Bring a young man of twenty into good com∣pany  Bred as he should be  he will in a year's time be more amiable and more truly polite than he who has been brought up with that view from his  infancy  for the  first  being capable of perceiv∣ing the reasons with respect to age condition or sex on which good manners are founded will easily reduce them to their true principles and accommodate them to every occasion while  the other  going only in the beaten road will be at a loss whenever he is put out of it  Introduisez une jeune homme de vingt ans dans le Monde bien conduit il sera dans un an plus aimable plus judicieusement poli que celui qu'on y aura nourri des son enfance car le premier etant capable de sentir les raisons de tous lés precédés relatifs a l'âge a l'état au sexe qui constituent cet usage les peut reduire en prin∣cipes et les etendre au cas non prévus au lieu que l'autre n'ayant que sa routine pour toute régle est embarassési tot qu'on l'y sort    Locke himself in another place says that  "Care∣lessness is allowed to that age and becomes them as well as compliments do grown people Or at least if some very nice people will think it a fault I am sure it is a fault that should be over∣looked and left to time a tutor and conversation to cure"  As for their  quarrels at chuck or ball  their  tricks and truantries  he who breeds his son in his own family will in vain expect to see him a man before his time Boys will be boys at home or abroad Every age has its follies and infirmities and those of youth and childhood though the most innocent are perhaps the most ungovernable  Locke talking in his usual style of the  malapert∣ness tricking and violence learnt amongst school boys  and therefore prefering Private Education endea∣vours to strengthen his argument by instancing  the retirement and bashfulness which daughters are brought up in  But surely daughters are not an apposite  example The chief duties of female life are do∣mestick those of a man are publick An officer physician lawyer or divine bred with his sister would not I conceive derive due benefit from his Education Sometimes however her society as well as that of the rest of his family might be of advantage both to his morals and understanding It is not necessary at present to deliver any opinion con∣cerning the proper education of daughters  Home  seems to be their natural province yet that  home  is often so exceptionable that perhaps even  they  would in general be in less danger abroad Schools exhibit∣ing bills that  "Young ladies are there educated and may be boarded"  are indeed sometimes dange∣rous seminaries yet perhaps there are few private families where the minds of daughters are likely to receive so much moral and intellectual improve∣ment as at the respectable  Recess  of the Miss Lees at Bath or the no less wholesome and improving nur∣sery of the Miss Moores at Bristol  Locke in his  Thoughts on Education  often con∣founds the idea of educating a single scholar with that of training a number of scholars in the first in∣stance he imposes on fathers and tutors such a task as none but a Scriblerus or an Old Shandy will ever  perform and such characters have in common life been long obsolete Rousseau and his  Emile  are a Young Quixote and an Old Sancho or as Rousseau himself rather chuses to style them a Robinson Crusoe and his man Friday  The forming of their minds and manners    says Locke  requiring a constant attention and particular application to every single boy which is impossible in a numerous flock and would be wholly in vain could he  the schoolmaster  have time to study and correct every one's particular defects and wrong in∣clinations when the lad was to be left to himself or the prevailing infection of his fellows the greatest part of the four and twenty hours  Having in the place just quoted shewn the impos∣sibility of paying proper attention to pupils in a publick school in the following passages are exhi∣bited the methods to be pursued in a private family both in regard to a single scholar or a sett of boys  Since he prefers this or that whatever play he delights in to his book that only he shall do and so in earnest set him on work on his beloved  play and keep him steadily and in earnest to it morning and afternoon till he be fully surfeited and would at any rate change it for some hours at his book again But when you thus set him a task of his play  you must be sure to look after him yourself or set some body else to do it  that may constantly see him employed in it and that he be not permitted to be idle at that too  This I think is sufficiently evident that chil∣dren generally hate to be idle All the care then is that their busie humour should be constantly employed in something of use to them which if you will attain you must make what you would have them do a  recreation  to them and not a  business  The way to do this so that they may not perceive you have any hand in it is this pro∣posed here  viz  To make them weary of that which you would not have them do by enjoyn∣ing and making them under some pretence or other do it till they are surfeited For example does your son play at top or scourge too much Enjoin him to play so many hours every day  and look that he do it  and you shall see he will quick∣ly be sick of it and willing to leave it By this  means making the recreations you dislike a  business  to him he will of himself with delight betake himself to those things you would have him do especi∣ally if they be proposed as rewards for having per∣formed his  task  in that play is commanded him For if he be ordered every day to whip his top so long as to make him sufficiently weary do you not think he will apply himself with eagerness to his book and wish for it if you promise it him as a reward for having whipped his top lustily quite out all the time that is set him Children in the things they do if they comport with their age find little difference so they may be doing The esteem they have for one thing above another they borrow from others So that what those about them make to be a reward to them will really be so By this art it is in their governour's choice whether  Scotchhoppers  shall reward their  dancing  or  dancing  their  Scotchhoppers  whether pegtop or reading playing at trap or studying the globes shall be more acceptable and pleasing to them All that they desire being to be busie and busie as they imagine in things of their own choice and which they receive as favours from their parents or others for whom they have re∣spect and with whom they would be in credit  A  sett of children  thus ordered and  kept from the ill example of others  would  all  of them I  suppose  with as much earnestness and delight learn to read write and what else one would have them as others do their ordinary plays And the eldest being thus entered and this made the fashion of the place it would be as impossible to hinder them from learning the one as it is ordinarily to keep them from the other  These extracts will perhaps convince most readers of the visionary prospects presented to parental  ima∣ginations  in many a  practical treatise  on Private Edu∣cation Several passages of the same nature occur in the tract now under consideration  One of the ready topicks of Locke's censure and raillery of Publick Schools is the  correction  occa∣sionally bestowed on idle irregular or obstinate pupils But say what he will of the use of the  rod  to lash dull boys into nouns and pronouns verbs gerunds and supines it is rarely exercised by a good Schoolmaster but when  wilfulness  or  ill example  de∣mands it on which occasions the  continued  severities enjoined by Locke much exceed the utmost rigours of Publick Education As for example  I would have a  father seldom strike his child  but upon very urgent necessity and as the last remedy  and then perhaps it will be fit to do it so that the child should not quickly forget it  And again  Whenever you come to that extremity it is not enough to whip or beat them you must do it till you find you have subdued their minds till with sub∣mission and patience they yield to the correction which you shall best discover by their crying and their ceasing from it upon your bidding  Without this the beat∣ing of children is but a passionate tyranny over them and it is mere cruelty and not correction to put their bodies in pain without doing their minds any good As this gives us a reason why children should seldom be corrected so it also prevents their being so For if whenever they are chastised it were done thus without passion soberly and yet essentially too  laying on the blows and smart not furiously and all at once but slowly with reasoning between and with observation how it wrought stopping when it had made them pliant pe∣nitent and yielding  they would seldom need the like punishment again being made careful to avoid the fault that deserved it Besides by this  means as  the punishment would not be lost for being too little and not effectual  so it would be kept from being too much  if we gave off as soon as we per∣ceived that it reached the mind and that was bettered  For since the chiding or beating of children should be always the least that possibly may be that which is laid on in the heat of anger seldom observes that measure but is commonly more than it should be though it proves  less than enough  The circumstance of  laying on the blows with rea∣soning between  exhibits a whimsical picture and re∣minds one of the pedagogue of Swift concluding every period with a lash And the idea of perceiv∣ing the very moment when the cure on the mind is effected by the operation on the tail is still more ludicrous The young patient however might per∣haps wish to remind the author of another passage in an early section of this tract there applied to the regimen of the body but not inapplicable on the present occasion  When such a gentle treatment will not stop the growing mischief nor hinder it from turning into a formed disease it will be time to seek the advice of some sober and discreet physician In this part I hope I shall find an easy belief and  nobody can have a pretence to doubt the advice of one who has spent some time in the study of Phy∣sick when he counsels you  not to be too forward in making use of  PHYSICK OR PHYSICIANS  I am unwilling to load the page with too many quotations but as the following is peculiarly in∣teresting and entertaining I flatter myself the reader will scarce think it demands an apology  A prudent and kind mother  of my acquaintance was on such an occasion forced to whip her little daughter at her first coming home from nurse  eight times successively the same morning  before she could master her  stubbornness  and obtain a com∣pliance in a very easy and indifferent manner  If she had left off sooner and stopped at the seventh whipping she had spoiled the child for ever  and by her unprevailing blows only confirmed her  refractoriness  very hardly afterwards to be cured But wisely persisting till she had bent her mind and suppled her will the only end of correction and chastisement she established her authority thoroughly in the very first occasion and had ever after a very ready compliance and obedience in all things from her daughter For as this was the  first time so  I think it was the last too  she ever struck her  Correction when necessary is certainly less pain∣ful both to parents and children when inflicted abroad than at home It is better that fathers should seem unconscious of the knowledge of all their petty trespasses and Locke though he here so much commends the repeated flagellations of  a little daugh∣ter by a prudent  and  kind mother  yet in the section first quoted declares  "I think it is best the  smart  should come more immediately  from another's hand  though by the parent's order  who should see it done  "  In confirmation of the lenity of masters of Pub∣lick Schools I shall venture to mention a little anecdote that came within my own knowledge during the time of my education at Westminster A gentleman not long since living was when a schoolboy more distinguished by the goodness of his disposition than the brilliancy of his parts Many of the forms usually committed to the care of assistants were however now and then visited by the head master On one of these occasions the gentleman I have spoken of was called out by Dr Nicoll to read and construe a part of the lesson to  the form which being in the upper school the lesson of the day was in Greek The honest lad conscious of his inability obeyed the call but in∣stead of attempting the lesson went up to the master and muttered indistinctly  Flog me Sir  Speak out child says the master  Flog me Sir if you please  repeats the scholar dropping his book and unbutton∣ing The master with a chastised smile laying his hand on his young pupil's head and gently patting him cried in a mild tone Go thy ways boy get thee to thy place again Thou art a very honest fel∣low but thou never wilt be a Scholar as long as thou livest  This story may serve as a companion to Locke's pictures of private correction and may serve to shew that good hearts may be found in Publick Schools as well as private families and that the discipline of  the rod  is not administered with more judicious discrimination in one system of education than the other  The  rewards  also are at Publick Schools as well chosen and as appropriated as the  punishments  the latter exhibiting as Locke enjoins the  disgrace  and the former adding to the  reputation  of the young  student The little shining coin of pennies twopences threepences and groats  in silver  given on any occasional display of industry or excellence are as triumphantly prized and carefully treasured by the young receiver as a medal by an antiquarian and are carefully carried home with joy and pride as pledges of their merit in their class and tokens of the approbation of their master A still higher mark of favour is the seasonable reward of distinguishing the diligence and abilities of a rising lad by promo∣tion in the school and anticipating his remove to a superior form Places and preferments are often gained at Westminster  Emulation  that great spur to improvement almost unknown in Domestick Tuition is greatly encouraged in the field of Publick Education This Locke himself acknowledges The custom of  challenging  as it is termed by the school boys promotes a won∣derful desire of excelling amongst young champions for literary preeminence This  challenging  is thus ordered and proves a keen incitement to diligence and perfection The boys of the form are called out to their lesson of the day The first boy per∣haps misconstrues his Aesop or Ovid the second corrects his mistake and takes his rank and place  or the second failing the third the fourth the fifth the sixth or the sixteenth in due order gives the right construction and supersedes all his schoolfellows of the class under examination so that a boy is often transported in a moment from the lower or  fag  end to the very top of the form As the young students advance towards the superior forms this practice in respect to their maturer years and progress in their studies is judiciously discon∣tinued  When I speak of the custom of Publick Schools I particularly refer to that of Westminster where I was bred and with whose customs I am best ac∣quainted not questioning that other Publick Schools have equal advantages  Verses  and  Themes  so reprobated by Locke are intended as exercises to teach scholars better to un∣derstand the poetical and prose compositions of the antients and not meant as he insinuates to render every scholar a  poet  or  declaimer  The various mea∣sures of poetry are more easily comprehended and more perfectly read by those who reduce the rules of prosody to practice For this purpose metrical centoes ludicrously styled  jointed dolls  fitting the end of one line to the beginning or middle of another  and even  nonsense verses  have their use For unless Virgil and Horace are to be prohibited to English pupils like the Bible to Roman Catholicks those who study them should be instructed to read them with propriety not conceiving that they are to be∣come Virgils and Horaces themselves  Themes  tend to open the mind and cannot possibly be prejudi∣cial To explain the  thesis  to the young students is no more ridiculous than the other helps which Locke himself not only allows but even prescribes to be given for the improvement of his pupils Milton as well as Locke objects to  themes and verses  as school exercises  "forcing the empty wits of children to acts of ripest judgment and the final work of a head filled by long reading and observing with elegant maxims and copious in∣vention"  But surely such objections deny to the improvement and cultivation of the mind the means necessarily used and recommended in the exercises of the body  Nec literas didicit nec natare  was as Locke observes a proverb to denote an ill and imperfect education It were as consistent therefore to say that a lad must not go into the water till he can swim as to forbid all attempts at composition till he has acquired and formed a style which de∣pends so much like personal grace and activity upon  practice False concords and false quantities re∣proved and amended guide the learner by degrees to true prosody and syntax  Barbarizing anglicisms  so offensive to Milton lead to pure latinity  "An art says Busby is the way of doing a thing surely readily and gracefully"  Grammar is the art of speaking and writing and was that or any other art ever attained without repeated efforts lead∣ing by insensible gradations through error to per∣fection The Latin pieces of verse and prose of Milton now extant were derived no doubt from long reading and observing His  Juvenilia  admirable as they are were certainly preceded by more puerile exercises and imperfect compositions  Didicit prius extimuitque magistrum  Repetitions by heart  are no more than selecting as Locke himself directs the beautiful passages from authors and impressing them on the memory of the reciter They should not it is true and they are not be too long nor too frequently exacted yet such exercises undoubtedly serve to strengthen the memory for every faculty of the mind as well as every limb of the body acquires vigour from use and exertion If  players  whom Locke sarcastically  instances have not all of them the best memories in the world every player perhaps possesses that fa∣culty in a greater degree than if he had not been called upon to the constant exercise of it in his profession  Greek  ought not to be excluded as Locke seems to exclude it from a young gentleman's education If languages are to be learnt so easily and so readily as Locke asserts Greek in particular ought not to be omitted and if those who have been initiated in that language do generally as he says seldom after∣wards make any proficiency how can it be expected that they who have not learnt even the rudiments as boys should attain that language when men This however is his method and proposal Give then rather in the course of their education the power and possibility of becoming adepts for this is all that can be done by education and you have dis∣charged your duty Every scholar who makes a very considerable progress in any language art or science is chiefly his own master  Greek  is at least as necessary and ornamental to a gentleman as a  trade  so earnestly recommended by Locke and full as polite and beneficial an accomplishment as the art of perfumery varnishing graving working in  iron brass or silver cutting or setting of pre∣cious stones or even grinding and polishing optical glasses  Rousseau is particularly partial to the occupation of a  joiner  one of the trades recommended by Locke and takes notice with an air of triumph that the Czar Peter exercised the employment of a ship's carpenter As to study he denies his pupil all books except Robinson Crusoe  Hardiness  so strongly recommended by Locke is much more likely to be obtained in a Publick School than at home where the illjudged tender∣ness of the parents of mamas especially often pro∣duces effeminacy which exposes the little master to the ridicule of all his Schoolfellows  "  Sheepish softness  it is allowed by Locke often enervates those who are bred like foplings at home"  He owns too on another occasion that  "it is  not unusual  to observe the children of gentle∣men's families treat the servants of the house with domineering words names of contempt and an imperious carriage as if they were of another race and species beneath them"  Other vices and weaknesses may also be learnt in the parlour the kitchen and the stable Of the contagion from a train of vicious domesticks Locke himself always appears extremely sensible In one place his words are these  "They frequently learn from unbred or debauched servants untowardly tricks and vices as otherwise they possibly would be ignorant of all their lives"  Locke well observes that  "the peculiar  physiog∣nomy of the mind  is most discoverable in children before cunning hath taught them to hide defor∣mities and conceal their ill inclinations under a dissembled outside"  Publick Education is infinitely better calculated than Domestick Tuition for the discovery of the natural features of the mind If a boy wears a mask his Schoolfellows will be sure to tear it off and betray his real disposition to general observation and indeed I scarce remember a single instance of a lad bred in a great school who did not retain strong traces of his puerile character all his life after  The first scenes of his life  therefore to use Locke's own words are best acted on a Publick Stage where his  predominant passions  and  prevailing inclina∣tions  being more open and exposed are most capable  of correction His very schoolfellows become masters in this instance for youth commonly in∣clines to the benignant and generous side  In regard to  morals  and  religion  those great and important considerations if it is duly weighed that the most nice and dangerous part of human life occurs between the commencement and conclusion of the period destined to education it is not won∣derful that publick schoolboys as well as private pupils should sometimes be found to be defective or culpable The sap will rise in the spring blights will strike the noblest plant and frosts will nip the fairest flower all that can be suggested by art is wholesome manure and providently to fence and guard against the heat or inclemency of the season In publick schools the duties of religion are by no means neglected All that Locke enjoins is duly taught The exercises of Saturday evening and the lessons of Monday morning are from the Bible and Prayer book The daily business of the school begins like that of the House of Commons with reading prayers One of the senior boys officiates as chaplain and the prayers are in Latin Even the Sacrament is at a proper age administered to the young disciples and I have witnessed amongst  those early communicants a solemnity of prepara∣tion and reception that would have done them honour at any succeeding period of their lives  Locke with an air of assumed candour towards the master of a school introduces the following ob∣servation  The difference is great between two or three pupils in the same house and three or fourscore boys lodged up and down For let the master's industry and skill be never so great it is impossible he should have fifty or one hundred scholars under his eye any longer than they are in school together nor can it be expected that he should instruct them successfully in any thing but their books The forming of their minds and manners requiring a constant attention and particular application to every single boy which is impossible in a numerous flock and would be wholly in vain could he have time to study and correct every one's particular defects and wrong inclinations when the lad was to be left to himself or the prevailing infection of his fellows the greatest part of the four and twenty hours  The absolute impossibility of  a constant application and particular attention to every single boy  and it  may be added the doubt whether such particular at∣tention would not rather injure than benefit the pupil by encouraging his selfimportance together with many other obvious difficulties oblige Locke himself at last to confess as has before been no∣ticed  "what shall be resolved in this case must in a great measure be left to the parents to be deter∣mined by their circumstances and conveniences"  But not to take advantage of such a reluctant con∣cession let us rather recommend to the master of a great school to keep a watchful eye on the conduct of the boys during the intervals of the school hours and carefully by himself and his assistants to visit and regulate the boarding houses The masters and mistresses of those houses must submit to his direc∣tions or abandon their employments for what parent would commit his son to a family supposed to be adverse to the general discipline of the school and whose inmates are indulged in irregularity and dissipation It is requisite also for Schoolmasters to be rather backward in granting leave for too fre∣quent visits at home for where they too much pre∣vail it has happened that  the home  and  the school  have each in their turns been pleaded by the young truant as an apology for his absence from both And this is one of the most fatal inroads from private  mismanagement on the beneficial influence of Pub∣lick Education where the wisdom of the institu∣tion is counteracted by the indiscretion of indivi∣duals  Suppose an author equally inclined to depreciate Domestick Tuition as Locke has in his little tract shewn himself disposed to ridicule and vilify Publick Education might not such a writer abandoning the straight path of candour and impartiality and assum∣ing the manners of a satyrical pleader and declaimer express himself to the following purport  I cannot bear to see the free spirit and generous nature of a youth that should look abroad into the world of which he is himself a part  "ca∣bin'd cribb'd confin'd"  in the narrow limits of a private family a puny fondling dandled on the lap of his mother or at best perhaps a tiny sportsman or soaker in company of his father If they have a country parson in the house who teaches my young master to read he teaches him to smoke at the same time and envelopes in the same cloud his person and his understanding  The first Latin that he conveys to him is the old axiom of  in vino veritas  and his Greek if he  has any is all  Anacreontick  It is odds indeed whether his learning extends so far He is per∣haps a mere  Lingo  or at best a  Square  or a  Thwackum  in Mr Allworthy's splendid mansion Over the servants of the family the heir apparent is a little tyrant and from his subjects he learns as soon as he can speak every species of provincial bar∣barism and as soon as he can think or act every kind of vice and meanness  Virtue wis∣dom breeding  and  learning  are seldom to be found under a private roof but must be sought like the Deity in a solemn temple consecrated to such sacred worship  Waving ridicule and irony and adhering as the subject requires to strict truth it must be confessed that Publick Education as well as Domestick Tui∣tion has its faults but many of the corruptions of schools are brought by the scholars from home At home are the foolish the idle and vicious ser∣vants so much dreaded by Locke At home indul∣gence takes the place of discipline and from home they often bring sums of money far beyond their little occasions by which artificial wants are created and disorders introduced This last evil wholly owing to the indiscretion of friends and parents has  been particularly noxious to Publick Schools Masters can only controul and check its influence Friends and parents alone can prevent and extirpate it  Publick Schools ought to cultivate the  mathema∣ticks  as well as the  classicks  Both might be taught sufficiently for the initiation of pupils during their stay at a Publick School from whence they ought to be sent to the Universities equally prepared to pursue their philosophical as their classical studies  Publick Schools also generally detain their pupils too long Youths should be dismissed from schools at the age of sixteen or seventeen at the latest They are afterwards commencing young men and will not patiently submit to the corrections of children When the boys at Westminster rebelled because a senior scholar between eighteen and nineteen years of age would not submit to the discipline of the rod Dr Barker then a prebend contended that the scholar was in the right It was wrong he said to attempt to scourge a youth at that age It was al∣most  sodomy  Pity that Dr Barker was not a Ge∣neral  In general it is unadvisable for parents to send their sons to a Great Publick School sooner than at  the period of nine or ten years of age not that I would wish the preceding period to be lost and bu∣ried in ignorance and idleness Let their children in the mean while be sent to some preparatory aca∣demy where they may be taught to write to read to speak French to dance to draw and the rudi∣ments of Latin according to the grammar of the school for which they are afterwards intended A master who cannot by himself and his assistants supply his little students with these helps is unfit to govern such an academy  One great reason for preference of Publick to Private Education is this Schoolboys being at in∣tervals called home partake occasionally of the en∣joyments and society of a family Private pupils constantly confined within one narrow circle ac∣quire none of the freedom and spirit of a Publick Education  Travel  where it can be afforded cannot be ac∣companied with the benefit that ought to attend it from the first stage of life one of the periods to which Locke destines it but being certainly im∣proper at the usual time and in the usual mode may be reserved to Locke's last Stage and therefore  properly succeeding to a removal from the Univer∣sities when the young traveller if not fit and able to go alone had better not go at all  Milton has given  A tractate on Education  contain∣ing a plan of a school and university in one intended to annihilate all other schools and universities by instituting as many of such academies as might be necessary in different parts of the kingdom Yet in this plan romantick as he almost himself seems to think it he has proceeded on principles very dif∣ferent from those of Locke and shewn himself the friend and advocate of Publick Education He rather follows the principles of Plato and Xenophon than adopts the system of Locke  His proposed number of pupils is an hundred and fifty more or less He directs the teaching of lan∣guages  not by rote  but by  grammar  and those not only modern but ancient and of the ancient not only Latin but Greek and Hebrew with the Chaldean and Syrian dialects So far from objecting to  repetitions  that he enjoins Grammar lessons  to be got by heart  and poems and orations not merely to be read but  "  put to memory  and solemnly an∣nounced with right accent and grace"  And though like Locke he regrets the time thrown  away in learning one or two languages yet himself appropriates no less time than nine years from twelve to twenty one to education He also fixes the age of twenty three or twenty four as the proper time for travel if travel be necessary So that on the whole though I have been hardy enough to enter the lists with such a giant antagonist as Locke I have Milton to support me  It appears indeed on the face of Locke's tract that the present plan of education is highly prefer∣able to the system that prevailed at the time of his writing The medical management of children is so much improved that many things which he re∣commends as contrary to the practice of those times are now in general use and as to the cul∣tivation of their minds were he now living he would no longer lament the want of a sixpenny History of the Bible or an Aesop with pictures to every fable The booksellers have provided the little students a Lilliputian library and every toyshop and Stationer will supply them with polygons for the vowels or the whole alphabet in cards or ivory unless they should rather chuse to swallow it in gin∣gerbread Geography is learnt by the dice like the Game of the Goose maps are dissected into  kingdoms and provinces and perhaps to Locke himself we owe many of those valuable atchieve∣ments  Universities those dry nurses that succeed to the first feminaries of education are also much improved in their principles and practice since the aeras of Milton and Locke and if the students do not at their departure make due progress in their several pursuits and professions the failure must be imputed to themselves who have so ill applied the time they have passed there At one university since the time of Milton a great and transcendent genius has ad∣vanced the career of science as Milton himself car∣ried the flights of poetry  beyond the visible diurnal sphere  At the other an acute and able jurisprudent whose early loss we still lament instituted a course of lectures of established authority to the professional reader as well as affording in the most elegant terms a code of law necessary for the instruction and perusal of every private gentleman The students too are now less bewildered in the labyrinths of lo∣gick and metaphysicks To their original resistance to the principles of Locke perhaps we owe much of his prejudice to Publick Education His prejudices were he now a living witness of the cordial reception  of his doctrines would perhaps vanish though he might still insist and not without justice accord∣ing to the Tirocinium  The  Tirocinium  forms part of a collection of poems by W Cowper Esq one of which poems is  The Task  a most admirable work in blank verse which gives a most promising earnest of the author's intended Translation of Homer in that measure  of my worthy and ingenious friend Mr Cowper that  Discipline  should stand as porter at the gate of every college  The study of Geography Chronology History the Elements of Natural Philosophy and Geometry may easily be reconciled to the plan of the early part of Publick Education and should be incorporated with it As to dancing fencing and accounts these are generally taught by separate masters according to the direction of the parents without need of parti∣cular injunction or serious dissertation Painting and musick are indeed not in so general request and the truth is that gentlemen practitioners either mis∣apply much of their time or fall infinitely below the most common artists of either profession If a  trade  is absolutely necessary to a student and a gen∣tleman that of a  gardener  seems to be the most  healthy and agreeable to which in bad weather may be added the occupation of a joiner or car∣penter as on that account both Locke and Rous∣seau recommend it And a schoolboy is perhaps more qualified even for such an apprenticeship as well as for the more honourable and hazardous avo∣cations of the army or navy than a young gentle∣man bred in a private family  Locke concludes his tract on education with these words  Though I am now come to a conclusion of what obvious remarks have suggested to me con∣cerning Education  I would not have it thought that I look on it as a just treatise on this subject  There are a thousand other things that may need consideration especially if one should take in the various tempers different inclinations and par∣ticular defaults that are to be found in children and prescribe proper remedies The variety is so great that it would require a volume nor would that reach it Each man's mind has some peculiarity as well as his face that distinguishes him from all others and there are possibly scarce two children who can be conducted by exactly the same method Besides that I think a prince a nobleman and an ordinary gentleman's son  should have different ways of breeding But having had here only some general views in re∣ference to the main end and aims in education and those designed for a gentleman's son who being then very little I considered only as white paper or wax to be moulded and fashioned as one pleases I have touched little more than those heads which I judged necessary for the breeding of a young gentleman of his condition in ge∣neral and have now published these my occa∣sional thoughts with this hope that though this be far from being a compleat treatise on this subject or such as that every one may find what will just fit his child in it yet it may give some small light to those whose concern for their dear little ones makes them so irregularly bold that they dare venture to consult their own reason in the education of their children rather than wholly to rely upon Old Custom  If Locke could not call his work  a compleat trea∣tise on Education  much less can I presume to submit these loose thoughts to the reader in that light espe∣cially as they are not offered under that idea but mere∣ly to vindicate Publick Establishments from censures that appeared coming from whomsoever unjust and illiberal If the awful and revered name of Locke  gave a sanction to prejudices it was but acting with the spirit though without the talents of Locke to combat them Almost all the systems of Private Education appear a romantick theory not reducible to practice Locke himself says  "that a prince a nobleman and an ordinary gentleman's son should have a different way of breeding"  Yet the attention enjoined to be given to his pupil not to dwell on the character of his  Tutor  are scarce to be expected even by a prince though he con∣fesses that his views and main end were to suggest hints on those heads necessary for the education of  a gentleman's son  A Telemachus may obtain a Minerva for a Mentor an English Prince may command a Markham or a Hurd but the son of a gentleman the son of a nobleman I will venture to say will at least derive as much benefit from a Publick Education as from Private Tuition Neither  themes  nor  verses  so dreaded by Locke impede their progress to the first offices and most important duties These are facts founded on experience and the many illustrious characters that have begun their career on a royal foundation will fully justify my assertion  How many  Ovids  MURRAY were thy boast  How many  Martials  were in PULTENEY lost  ☞ The following short and occasional Dissertation on Tails having been accidentally omitted in its proper place brings up the rear of the  Prose  in this vo∣lume  To the PRINTER of the ST JAMES's CHRONICLE  Thursday August  SIR  CASTING my eye on the London Gazette a few days ago it gave me infinite pleasure to see particular Orders issued from the WarOffice  "That all His Majesty's Regiments of Horse and Dragoons except the Light Horse shall be mounted only on such horses as have their  full tails without the least part taken from them  "  Never surely did the tyrant man exercise a more wanton piece of cruelty over his subjects of the brute creation than in clipping the Tails of the horses and robbing them of their fair and natural proportion Castration itself cruel as it is carries to sportsmen and epicures some apology along with  it Fowls become a plumper and more delicious morsel after being made capons and horses con∣verted into geldings are thereby rendered more tract∣able But we of the  Yahoo  species have nothing to plead in our excuse to the generous  Houhnymn  for thus barbarously depriving him of a part of his frame which nature has wisely given him for several purposes both of use and ornament  Custom it is true has long authorised this savage practice yet it has not been able to reconcile us to it entirely In sculpture painting and tapestry horses still wear  their full tails without the least part taken from them  Do but contemplate the figure of a king on horseback on a pedestal or of a general in a battle piece either on canvas or in the arras the mane and tail of the horse is as full and flowing as the periwig of the rider The tail of Bucephalus himself has not a bolder sweep than that of the noble beasts who bear Lewis the Fourteenth or the duke of Marlborough What should we say to Stubbs were he to put a set of docked geldings to the chariot of Phaeton Or how should we consider the very same mutilations were we to make the experiments on other quadrupeds Figure to yourself the view of a pasture covered with bulls cows sheep and oxen  grazing on a common or a mountain as bare∣breeched as a highlander  This practice also to the shame of our age and nation be it spoken is both local and recent In the antient times of chivalry what figure would a knight have made on such a maimed steed and what damsel would have deigned to mount a bob∣tailed palfry The beginning even of the present century saw our horses still in possession of their  full tails  It was then the  Bon Ton  "Fopping∣ton's  long tails  were known on every road in christendom"  At present except Lord Fal∣mouth's set of duns and the royal  octave  of creamcoloured horses we have alas no  long tails  in the kingdom But the year one thousand seven hun∣dred and sixty four is I hope the happy aera from whence we may date their restoration All the English Cavalry except the Light Horse  "shall be mounted only on such horses as have their full tails  without the least part taken from them  "  It was indeed high time for such a reformation Many centuries elapsed before our constitution pro∣vided a law against attempts to deface and maim the human body and it was now become equally ne∣cessary to issue the above Orders from the WarOffice  which it is hoped will operate as a kind of  Coven∣try Act  against  hogging docking  and  nicking  the horses  As a true patriot I am equally anxious to wipe off a national reflection as to alter the fashion This cruel practice is one of the stains on our man∣ners which has given our enemies occasion to style us  The Savages of Europe  In France neither horse nor man nor woman can have too much hair but all carry it unviolated on their heads and their tails  "without the least part taken from them"  In England fullbottoms and full tails vanished at the same period Cropeared coxcombs and docked horses  hogged  manes and  hogged  toupees came in together A wonderful analogy between the treat∣ment of our fellow countrymen's heads and their horses tails From this analogy it is that our neigh∣bours have imbibed the associated idea of the savage∣ness of our manners and an Englishman at Paris is sure to be reproached with the barbarity of our beheading kings and docking horses  A celebrated French writer expresses himself thus on this combination of inhuman usages in this country  Ah barbare Angleterre ou le fatale couteau  Trenche les têtes aux rois les cues aux chevaux  Some curious readers have in vain searched the Henriade of Voltaire for these lines It would have been equally vain to search the rest of his works or those of any other French author It is indeed im∣possible that such a couplet could have found a place in the Epick Poem from which they are pretendedly cited And if the writer had not heard them gravely quoted as lines of Voltaire he should have thought it needless to mention that the French distich and the free translation both owe their origin to the writer of  Hippolitus    Voltaire's Henriade  With a free translation of the above lines I shall conclude these reflections  Ah barb'rous England kings and steeds to dock  To curtail tails and sentence block to block  I am Sir Your humble servant HIPPOLITUS  VERSE ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS  ADVERTISEMENT  That the reader may

rage  I pardonAbove all take special heed  Not to recall it to his memory  That this day is the day whereon I die  TWO ODES  PINDAR OLYMP II  FIRST PUBLISHED IN MDCCLIX  ODE TO OBSCURITY  I  DAUGHTER of Chaos and old Night  Cimmerian Muse all hail  That wrapt in nevertwinkling gloom canst write  And shadowest meaning with thy dusky veil  What Poet sings and strikes the strings  It was the mighty Theban spoke  He from the everliving lyre  With magick hand elicits fire  Heard ye the din of modern rhimers bray  It was cool Mn or warm Gy  Involv'd in tenfold smoke  I  The shallow fop in antick vest  Tir'd of the beaten road  Proud to be singularly drest  Changes with every changing moon the mode  Say shall not then the heav'n born Muses too  Variety pursue  Shall not applauding criticks hail the vogue  Whether the muse the style of Cambria's sons  Or the rude gabble of the Huns  Or the broader dialect  Of Caledonia she affect  Or take Hibernia thy still ranker brogue  I  On this terrestrial ball  The tyrant Fashion governs all  She fickle goddess whom in days of yore  The ideot Moria on the banks of Seine  Unto an antick fool hight Andrew bore  Long she paid him with disdain  And long his pangs in silence he conceal'd  At length in happy hour his lovesick pain  On thy blest Calends April he reveal'd  From their embraces sprung  Ever changing ever ranging  Fashion goddess ever young  II  Perch'd on the dubious height she loves to ride  Upon a weathercock astride  Each blast that blows around she goes  While nodding o'er her crest  Emblem of her magic pow'r  The light Cameleon stands confest  Changing it's hues a thousand times an hour  And in a vest is she array'd  Of many a dancing moonbeam made  Nor zoneless is her waist  But fair and beautiful I ween  As the Cestuscinctur'd Queen  Is with the rainbow's shadowy girdle brac'd  II  She bids pursue the fav'rite road  Of lofty cloudcapt Ode  Meantime each bard with eager speed  Vaults on the Pegasean Steed  Yet not that Pegasus of yore  Which th' illustrious Pindar bore  But one of nobler breed  High blood and youth his lusty veins inspire  From Tottipontimoy he came  Who knows not Tottipontimoy thy name  The Bloodyshoulder'd Arab was his fire  The author is either mistaken in this place or has else indulged himself in a very unwarrantable poetical licence Whitenose was not the sire but a son of the Godolphin Arabian See my Calendar  HE  His Whitenose He on fam'd Doncastria's plains  Resign'd his fated breath  In vain for life the struggling courser strains  Ah who can run the race with death  The tyrant's speed or man or steed  Strives all in vain to fly  He leads the chace he wins the race  We stumble fall and die  Third from Whitenose springs  Pegasus with eagle wings  Light o'er the plain as dancing cork  With many a bound he beats the ground  While all the turf with acclamation rings  He won Northampton Lincoln Oxford York  He too Newmarket won  There Granta's son  Seized on the steed  And thence him led so fate decreed  To where old Cam renown'd in poet's song  With his dark and inky waves  Either bank in silence laves  Winding slow his sluggish streams along  III  What Stripling neat of visage sweet  In trimmest guise array'd  First the neighing steed assay'd  His hand a taper switch adorns his heel  Sparkles refulgent with elastick steel  The whiles he wins his whiffling way  Prancing ambling round and round  By hill and dale and mead and greenswerd gay  Till sated with the pleasing ride  From the lofty steed dismounting  He lies along enwrapt in conscious pride  By gurgling rill or crystal fountain  III  Lo next a Bard secure of praise  His selfcomplacent countenance displays  His broad mustachios ting'd with golden die  Flame like a meteor to the troubled air  Proud his demeanor and his eagle eye  O'er hung with lavish lid yet shone with glorious glare  The grizzle grace  Of bushy peruke shadow'd o'er his face  In large wide boots whose ponderous weight  Would sink each other wight of modern date  He rides well pleas'd So large a pair  Not Garangantua's self might wear  Not He of nature fierce and cruel  Who if we trust to antient ballad  Devour'd three pilgrims in a fallad  Not He of fame germane hight Pantagruel  III  Accoutred thus th' adventrous Youth  Seeks not the level lawn or velvet mead  Fast by whose side clear streams meandring creep  But urges on amain the fiery steed  Up Snowdon's shaggy side or Cambrian rock uncouth  Where the venerable herd  Of goats with long and sapient beard  And wanton kidlings their blithe revels keep  Now up the mountain see him strain  Now down the vale he's tost  Now flashes on the sight again  Now in the palpable obscure quite lost  IV  Man's feeble race eternal dangers wait  With high or low all all is woe  Disease mischance pale fear and dubious fate  But o'er every peril bounding  Ambition views not all the ills surrounding  And tiptoe on the mountain's steep  Reflects not on the yawning deep  IV  See see he soars with mighty wings outspread  And long resounding mane  The Courser quits the plain  Aloft in air see see him bear  The Bard who shrouds  His lyrick glory in the clouds  Too fond to strike the stars with lofty head  He topples headlong from the giddy height  Deep in the Cambrian gulph immerg'd in endless night  IV  O Steed Divine what daring spirit  Rides thee now tho' he inherit  Nor the pride nor self opinon  Which elate the Mighty Pair  Each of taste the fav'rite minion  Prancing thro' the desart air  By help mechanick of Equestrian block  Yet shall he mount with classick housings grac'd  And all unheedful of the critick mock  Drive his light courser o'er the bounds of taste  ODE TO OBLIVION  I  According to Lillaeus who bestows the parental function on Oblivion  Verba OBLIVISCENDI regunt GENITIVUM  Lib xiii Cap  There is a similar passage in Busbaeus  PARENT of Ease Oblivion old  Who lov'st thy dwelling place to hold  Where scepter'd Pluto keeps his dreary sway  Whose sullen pride the shiv'ring ghosts obey  Thou who delightest still to dwell  By some hoar and mossgrown cell  At whose dank foot Cocytus joys to roll  Or Styx' black streams which even Jove controul  Or if it suit thy better will  To chuse the tinkling weeping rill  Hard by whose side the seeded poppy red  Heaves high in air his sweeetlycurling head  While creeping in meanders slow  Lethe's drowsy waters flow  And hollow blasts which never cease to sigh  Hum to each carestruck mind their lullalullaby  A prey no longer let me

fair silent queen  The solemn stole of grief is never seen  II  All all is thine Thy pow'rful sway  The throng'd poetick hosts obey  Tho' in the van of Mem'ry proud t'appear  At thy command they darken in the rear  What tho' the modern tragick strain  For nine whole days protract thy reign  Yet thro' the nine like whelps of currish kind  Scarcely it lives weak impotent and blind  Sacred to thee the crambo rhime  The motley forms of pantomime  For thee from Eunuch's throat still loves to flow  The soothing sadness of his warbled woe  Each day to thee falls pamphlet clean  Each month a newborn magazine  Hear then O Goddess hear thy votry's pray'r  And if thou deign'st to take one moment's care  Attend thy bard who duly pays  The tribute of his votive lays  Whose muse still offers at thy sacred shrine  Thy bard who calls THEE His and makes Him THINE  O sweet Forgetfulness supreme  Rule supine o'er ev'ry theme  O'er each sad subject o'er each soothing strain  Of mine O Goddess stretch thine awful reign  Nor let Mem'ry steal one note  Which this rude hand to thee hath wrote  So shalt thou save me from the poet's shame  Tho' on the letter'd rubrick Dodsley post my name  III  O come with opiate poppies crown'd  Shedding slumbers soft around  O come Fat Goddess drunk with Laureat sack  See where she sits on the benumb'd Torpedo's back  Me in thy dull Elysium wrapt O bless  With thy calm forgetfulness  And gently lull my senses all the while  With placid poems in the sinking stile  Whether the HerringPoet sing  Great Laureat of the fishes' king  Or Lycophron prophetick rave his fill  Wrapt in the darker strains of Johnny  Or if HE sing whose verse affords  A bevy of the choicest words  Who meets his Lady Muse by mossgrown cell  Adorn'd with epithet and tinkling bell  These Goddess let me still forget  With all the dearth of Modern Wit  So may'st thou gently o'er my youthful breast  Spread with thy welcome hand Oblivion's friendly vest  THE LAW STUDENT  WRITTEN IN

Breakfast and the Cruel Fair  I sing Calliope the verse prepare  Say why such rage inflam'd a Lady's soul  To rob the hungry stomach of it's ROLL  Now 'gan the Sun the dappled east t'adorn  And troops of feather'd warblers hail'd the morn  Brisk Chanticleer flew crowing from his bed  And prest Dame Partlet with the morning tread  Ducks quack hogs grunt dogs howl and horses neigh  With Nature's musick ush'ring in the day  Sounds lost alas too soon in ruder note  With clamour issuing from Atossa's throat  Now sounding thro' the house with dreadful knell  The loudtongu'd clapper strikes upon the bell  The maid in haste half huddling on her cloaths  The termagant Sir John's fair partner rose  She comes her clamour strikes all others dumb  My Lady frowns and all the house looks glum  Some furious ravings in the kitchen past  The tardy Breakfast greets our eyes at last  Three scraps of bread and butter sad we see  Two lumps of sugar and six grains of tea  Hunger they say thro' stony walls will break  As bards write libels for a dinner's sake  Hunger all arts and sciences can teach  Makes lawyers plead quacks kill and parsons preach  Hence Cousin rose the workings in thy brain  A better meal by stratagem to gain  Butter'd by stealth by stealth most slily got  Smok'd on the board a French Roll piping hot  Pale as grim Ghost whose mealy aspect shocks  And red by turns as twenty TurkeyCocks  With eyes inflam'd and leer malign she view'd  The dearbought morsel of delicious food  " And have I then so oft enrag'd she cried  My longing soul its foremost wish denied  So oft have

good Madam where's that mod'rate man  Who will not mend his lot when e'er he can  Who will not for a palace slight a cot  Or leave cold mutton for a slice of hot  Where lofty Highgate haughtily looks down  On all the smokegirt steeples of the town  By an old wizardsage around my head  The branching Antlers of a Stag were spread  There by those Horns I swore those sacred Horns  A solemn oath no Christian trav'ler scorns  Ne'er with unhallow'd tooth Brown Bread to bite  When kinder fortune should afford me White  He said and feasted on the luscious diet  Eat says Sir John Eat Cousin and Be Quiet  CANTO II  Once more the Sun his daily course began  Once more shrill noises through the chambers ran  Once more the scanty Breakfast was prepar'd  Once more O monstrous a French Roll appear'd  Not Echo from her cave so deep resounds  With the full cry of twenty packs of hounds  Not cawing rooks pies chatt'ring scolding wives  Cats mewing grating saws and grinding knives  Not all Hell loose led on by Death and Sin  E'er rent the ear with such tremendous din  " It is the Cause it is the Cause my Soul"  Enrag'd she cry'd and seiz'd the fatal Roll  " Call ring the bell Ned Thomas Harry Jack

Hecuba the Mobled Queen  " Curst be the man that ever eats she said  " And doubly curst be He that gives him Bread  " Bread the prime cause whence all our evils flow  " Which now to Bakers shall work bitter woe"  Onwards she went whirl'd like a schoolboy's top  Ent'ring with dreadful stride the Baker's shop  The pliant paste He well could knead and mould  And better loaves no London Baker sold  But his old frame now tottering with years  Deafness had clos'd the portal of his ears  With murmurs vague th' imperfect sense betray'd  And sounds uncertain to his ears convey'd  Him did My Lady with rough questions greet  And he reply'd but ne'er gave answer meet  Why TraitorVillain why is this she said  Why dost thou load me with such heaps of Bread  Is't not enough to send Brown Bread by Pecks  And that the White my stately table decks  But Rolls vile Rolls my quiet must perplex  Madam he cried half hearing what she said  I'm sure no Baker e'er sold better Bread  And as for Rolls not Brentford sends so white  Or Uxbridge Bakers make them half so light  And dost thou mock me then vile slave she cried  Madam You're very welcome He replied  As on the kitchenfire a boiler large  Heats by degrees it's elemental charge  First from the top a misty steam it flings  Warms then ferments then simmers and then sings  Now foaming raging boiling bubbling quick  Scarce on the brim the rattling lid will stick  So heated by degrees inflam'd at last  Full at his head a huge Peck Loaf she cast  Ah Vixen Lady as he fell he cried  And the loose tallies clatter'd at his side  O for a Muse to sound the trump of war  And all this dread encounter to declare  How Bricks Rolls Crusts in thick confusion flew  Huge Pecks HalfPecks and Quartern Loaves they threw  Now from within ran forth the Baker's Wife  Aghast and trembling for her husband's life  Revenge she cry'd for sweet Revenge I come  My poor deaf husband have they struck thee dumb  Then greeting first with most uncourteous flap  My Lady's face she fasten'd on her cap  Her own that instant felt my Lady's hand  And face to face and cap to cap they stand  Pulling and rending pinching tearing biting  Now slap now scratch now scolding and now fighting  So have I seen in Jack o'Lanthorn quick  Fierce Battle 'twixt a Baker and Old Nick  Full closely each engag'd in desp'rate hug  This way the Baker that the Devil tug  Now

when great Sir Oak  Held all the Trees beneath his yoke  The Monarch anxious to maintain  In peaceful state his Sylvan reign  Saw to his sorrow and distraction  His subject trees take root in faction  And though late join'd in union hearty  Now branching into shoots of party  Each sturdy stick of factious wood  Stood stiff and stout for Publick Good  For Patriots ever 'tis well known  Seek other's welfare not their own  And all they undertake you know  Is meant  pro Bono Publico  The hardy Fir from northern earth  Who took its name and drew its birth  The Oak plac'd next him to support  His government and grace his court  The Fir of an uncommon size  Rearing his head unto the skies  O'er topp'd his fellowplants his height  They view'd and sicken'd at the sight  With envy ev'ry fibre swell'd  While in them the proud sap rebell'd  Shall then they cried the Ash the Elm  The Beech no longer rule the helm  What shall th' ignoble Fir a plant  In tempest born and nurs'd in want  From the black regions of the North  And native famine issue forth  In this our happier soil take root  And dare our birthright to dispute  On this the fatal storm began  Confusion through the Forest ran  Mischief in each dark shade was brewing  And all betoken'd gen'ral ruin  While each to make their party good  Brib'd the vile shrubs and Underwood  And now the Bramble and the Thistle  Sent forth Ode Essay and Epistle  To which anon with equal mettle  Reply'd the Thorn and Stingingnettle  What's to be done or how oppose  The storm which in the Forest rose  Grief shook the mighty Monarch's mind

drudging on in heavy Prose  Day after day year after year  Which I have sent the Gazetteer  Now for the first time I essay  To write in your own easy way  And now O Lloyd I wish I had  To go that road your ambling pad  While you with all a Poet's pride  On the Great Horse of Verse might ride  You leave the road that's rough and stony  To pace and whistle with your Poney  Sad proof to us you're lazy grown  And fear to gall your hucklebone  For he who rides a nag so small  Will soon we fear ride none at all  There are and nought gives more offence  Who have some fav'rite excellence  Which evermore they introduce  And bring it into constant use  Thus Garrick still in ev'ry part  Has Pause and Attitude and Start  The Pause I will allow is good  And so perhaps the Attitude  The Starts too fine but if not scarce  The Tragedy becomes a Farce  I have too pardon me some quarrel  With other branches of your Laurel  I hate the style that still defends  Yourself or praises all your friends  As if the club of wits was met  To make eulogiums on the Set  Say must the town for ever hear  And no Reviewer deign to sneer  Of Thornton's Humour Garrick's Nature  And Colman's Wit and Churchill's Satire  Churchill wholet it not offend  If I make free though he's your friend  And sure we cannot want excuse  When Churchill's nam'd for Smart Abuse  Churchill who ever loves to raise  On Slander's dung his mushroom bays  The Priest I grant has something clever  A something that will last for ever  Let him in part be made your pattern  Whose Muse now queen and now a slattern  Trick'd out in Rosciad rules the roast  Turns trapes and trollops in the Ghost  By turns both tickles us and warms  And drunk or sober has her charms  Garrick to whom with lath and plaister  You try to raise a fine pilaster  And found on Lear and Macbeth  His monument e'en after death  Garrick's a Dealer in grimaces  A Haberdasher of wry faces  A Hypocrite in all his stages  Who laughs and cries for hire and wages  As undertaker's men draw grief  From onion in their handkerchief  Like real mourners cry and sob  And of their passions make a job  And Colman too that little sinner  That Essayweaver Dramaspinner  Too much the Comick Sock will use  For 'tis the Law must find him shoes  And though he thinks on Fame's wide ocean  He swims and has a pretty motion  Inform him Lloyd for all his grin  That Harry Fielding

 Who still delights to run his rig  On Citizen and Perriwig  Good sense I know though dash'd with oddity  In Thornton is no scarce commodity  Much learning too I can descry  Beneath  his  perriwig doth lie  I beg his pardon I declare  His grizzle's gone for greasy hair  Which now the Wag with ease can screw  With dirty ribband in a queue  But why neglect his trade forsaking  For scribbling and for merrymaking  With Tye to overshade that brain  Which might have shone in Warwicklane  Why not with spectacles on nose  In chariot lazily repose  A formal pompous deep physician  Himself a SignPost

with quick progression  How smartly you can make digression  Your rambling spirit now confine  And speak to Lloyd in ev'ry line  Tell me then Lloyd what is't you mean  By cobbling up a Magazine  A Magazine a wretched olio  Purloin'd from quarto and from folio  From pamphlet newspaper and book  Which tost up by a monthly cook  Borrows fine shapes and titles new  Of fricasee and rich ragoût  Which Dunces dress as well as You  Say is't for You your wit to coop  And tumble through this narrow hoop  The body thrives and so the mind  When both are free and unconfin'd  But harness'd in like hackney tit  To run the monthly stage of wit  The Racer stumbles in the shaft  And shews he was not meant for draft  Potbellied gluttons slaves of taste  Who bind in leathern belt their waist  Who lick their lips at ham or haunch  But hate to see the strutting paunch  Full often rue the pain that's felt  From circumscription of the belt  Thus women too we ideots call  Who lace their shapes too close and small  Tight stays they find oft end in humps  And take too late alas to jumps  The Chinese ladies cramp their feet  Which seem indeed both small and neat  While the dear creatures laugh and talk  And can do ev'ry thingbut walk  Thus you "who trip it as you go  " On the light fantastic toe"  And in the Ring are ever seen  Or RottenRow of Magazine  Will cramp your Muse in fourfoot verse  And find at last your ease your curse  Clio already humbly begs  You'd give her leave to stretch her legs  For though sometimes she takes a leap  Yet on All Fours she can but creep  While NambyPamby thus you scribble  Your manly turns are merely fribble  Pinn'd down and sickly cannot vapour  Nor dare to spring or cut a caper  Rouse then for shame your ancient spirit  Write a great work a work of merit  The conduct of your Friend examine  And give a  Prophecy of Famine    Or like Yourself in days of yore  Write  Actors  as you did before  Write what may pow'rful friends create you  And make your present friends all hate you  Learn not a shuffling shambling pace  But go erect with manly grace  For Ovid says and pray thee heed it  Os homini sublime dedit  But if you still waste all your

those hours which once I us'd to bless  Hours that for ever on my memory press  When my young heart awake to honest love  First caught th' infection Time can ne'er remove  No coxcomb proud to charm an artless maid  No rake that wish'd her innocence betray'd  No wordling whose mean soul resign'd to pelf  Courted vile gold but fond of her herself  To win her heart I made my only care  And once believ'd I had an int'rest there  Hap'ly I had and yet oh sad reverse  To lose that interest made it more my curse  Why didst thou Fortune throw me in her way  Just long enough to steal my soul away
