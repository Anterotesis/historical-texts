 THE ROMAN HISTORY From the FOUNDATION of the CITY OF ROME To the DESTRUCTION of the WESTERN EMPIRE BY DR GOLDSMITH IN TWO VOLUMES  VOLUME THE FIRST  LONDON Printed for S BAKER and G LEIGH in YORKSTREET T DAVIES in RUSSELSTREET COVENTGARDEN and L DAVIS in HOLBORN M DCC LXIX  PREFACE  THERE are some subjects on which a writer must decline all attempts to acquire fame satisfied with being obscurely useful After such a number of Roman Histories in all languages ancient and modern it would be but imposture to pretend new discoveries or to expect to offer any thing in a work of this kind which has not been often anticipated by others The facts which it relates have been an hundred times repeated and every occurrence has been so variously considered that learning can scarce find a new anecdote or genius give novelty to the old  I hope therefore for the readers indulgence if in the following attempt it shall appear that my only aim was to supply a concise plain and unaffected narrative of the rise and decline of a well known empire I was contented to make such a book as could not fail of being  serviceable though of all others the most unlikely to promote the reputation of the writer Instead therefore of pressing forward among the ambitious I only claim the merit of knowing my own strength and falling back among the hindmost ranks with conscious inferiority  I am not ignorant however that it would be no such difficult task to pursue the same arts by which many dull men every day acquire a reputation in history such might easily be attained by fixing on some obscure period to write upon where much seeming erudition might be displayed almost unknown because not worth remembering and many maxims in politics might be advanced entirely new because altogether false But I have pursued a contrary method chusing the most noted period in history and offering no remarks but such as I thought strictly true  The reasons of my choice were that we had no history of this splendid period in our language but was either too voluminous for common use or too meanly written to please Catrou and Rouille's history in six volumes folio translated into our language by Bundy is entirely unsuited to the time and expence mankind usually chuse to bestow upon this subject Ro  and his continuator Crevier making above thirty volumes octavo seem to labour under the same imputation as likewise Hooke  who has spent three quartos upon the republic alone the rest of his undertaking remaining unfinished There only therefore remained the history of Echard in five volumes octavo whose plan and mine seemed to coincide and had his execution been equal to his design it had precluded the present undertaking But the truth is it is so poorly written the facts so crowded the narration so spiritless and the characters so indistinctly marked that the most ardent curiosity must cool in the perusal and the noblest transactions that ever warmed the human heart as described by him must cease to interest  I have endeavoured therefore in the present work or rather compilation to obviate the inconveniencies arising from the exuberance of the former as well as from the unpleasantness of the latter It was supposed that two volumes might be made to comprize all that was requisite to be known or pleasing to be read by such as only examined history to prepare them for more important studies Too much time may be given even to laudable pursuits and there is none more apt than this to allure the student from more necessary branches of learning and if I may so express it entirely to engross his industry What is here offered therefore may be sufficient for all but such as make history the peculiar business of their  lives to such the most tedious narrative will seem but an abridgment as they measure the merits of a work rather by the quantity than the quality of its contents Others however who think more soberly will agree that in so extensive a field as that of the transactions of Rome more judgment may be shewn by selecting what is important than by adding what is obscure The history of this empire has been extended to six volumes folio and I aver that with very little learning it might be encreased to sixteen more but what would this be but to load the subject with unimportant facts and so to weaken the narration as that like the empire it described it must necessarily sink beneath the weight of its own acquisitions  But while I thus have endeavoured to avoid prolixity it was found no easy matter to prevent crowding the facts and to give every narrative its proper play In reality no art can continue to avoid opposite defects he who indulges in minute particularities will be often languid and he who studies conciseness will as frequently be dry and unentertaining As it was my aim to comprize as much as possible in the smallest compass it is feared the work will often be subject to the latter imputation but it was impossible to furnish the public with a cheap Roman history in two volumes octavo and at the same time to give all that warmth to  the narrative all those colourings to the description which works of twenty times the bulk have room to exhibit I shall be fully satisfied therefore if it furnishes an interest sufficient to allure the reader to the end and this is a claim to which few abridgements can justly make pretensions  To these objections there are some who may add that I have rejected many of the modern improvements in Roman history and that every character is left in full possession of that fame or infamy which it obtained from its cotemporaries or those who wrote immediately after I acknowledge the charge for it appears now too late to rejudge the virtues or the vices of those men who were but very incompletely known even to their own historians The Romans perhaps upon many occasions formed wrong ideas of virtue but they were by no means so ignorant or abandoned in general as not to give their brightest characters the greatest share of their applause and I do not know whether it be fair to try pagan actions by the standard of christian morality  But whatever may be my execution of this work I have very little doubts about the success of the undertaking the subject is the noblest that ever employed human attention and instead of requiring a writer's aid will even support him with its splendor The Empire  of the world rising from the meanest origin and growing great by a strict veneration for religion and an implicit confidence in its commanders continually changing the mode but seldom the spirit of its government being a constitution in which the military power whether under the name of citizens or soldiers almost always prevailed adopting all the improvements of other nations with the most indefatigable industry and submitting to be taught by those whom it afterwards subdued This is a picture that must affect us however it be disposed these materials must have their value under the hand of the meanest workman  CONTENTS  CHAP I  OF the origin of the Romans page  CHAP II  From the building of Rome to the death of Romulus page  CHAP III  From the death of

COMMONWEALTH OF ROME  CHAPTER I Of the origin of the Romans  ALL nations seem willing to derive merit from the splendor of their original and where history is silent they generally supply the defect with fable The Romans were particularly desirous of being thought descended from the gods as if to hide the meanness of their real ancestry Aeneas the son of Venus and Anchises having escaped from the destruction of  Troy after many adventures and dangers arrived in Italy where he was kindly received by  Latinus king of the Latins who gave him his daughter Lavinia in marriage Italy was then as it is now divided into a number of small states independent of each other and consequently subject to frequent contentions among themselves Turnus king of the Rutuli was the first who opposed Aeneas he having long made pretensions to Lavinia himself A war ensued in which the Trojan hero was victorious and Turnus slain In consequence of this Aeneas built a city which was called Lavinium in honour of his wife and some time after engaging in another war against Mezentius one of the petty kings of the country he was vanquished in turn and died in battle after a reign of four years Ascanius his son succeeded to the kingdom and to him Silvius a second son whom he had by Lavinia It would be tedious and uninteresting to recite a dry catalogue of the kings that followed and of whom we know little more than the names it will be sufficient to say that the succession continued for near four hundred years in the family and that Numitor the fifteenth from Aeneas was the last king of Alba  Numitor who took possession of the kingdom in consequence of his father's will had a brother named Amulius to whom were left the treasures which had been brought from Troy As riches but too generally prevail against  right Amulius made use of his wealth to supplant his brother and soon found means to possess himself of the kingdom Not content with the crime of usurpation he added that of murder also Numitor's sons first fell a sacrifice to his suspicions and to remove all aprehensions of being one day disturbed in his ill got power he caused Rhea Silvia his brother's only daughter to become a vestal virgin which office obliging her to perpetual celibacy made him less uneasy as to the claims of posterity  His precautions however were all frustrated in the event for Rhea Silvia going to fetch water from a neighbouring grove was met and ravished by a man whom perhaps to palliate her offence she averred to be Mars the god of war Whoever this lover of hers might have been whether some person who deceived her by assuming so great a name or Amulius himself as some writers are pleased to affirm it matters not certain it is that in due time she was brought to bed of two boys who were no sooner born than devoted by the usurper to destruction The mother was condemned to be buried alive the usual punishment for vestals who had violated their chastity and the twins were ordered to be flung into the river Tyber It happened however at the time this rigorous sentence was put into execution that the river had more than usually overflowed  its banks so that the place where the children were thrown being at a distance from the main current the water was too shallow to drown them In this situation therefore they continued without harm and that no part of their preservation might want its wonders we are told that they were for some time suckled there by a wolf until Faustulus the king's herdsman finding them thus exposed brought them home to Acca Laurentia his wife who brought them up as her own Some however will have it that the nurse's name was Lupa which gave rise to the story of their being nourished by a wolf but it is needless to weed out a single improbability from accounts where the whole is overgrown with fable  Romulus and Remus the twins thus strangely preserved seemed early to discover abilities and desires above the meanness of their supposed original The shepherds life began to displease them and from tending flocks or hunting wild beasts they soon turned their strength against the robbers round the country whom they often stript of their plunder to share it among their fellow shepherds  In one of these excursions it was that Remus was taken prisoner by Numitor's herdsmen who brought him before the king and accused him of the very crime which he had so often attempted to suppress Romulus however being  informed by Faustulus of his real birth was not remiss in assembling a number of his fellow shepherds in order to rescue his brother from prison and force the kingdom from the hands of the usurper Yet being too feeble to act openly he directed his followers to assemble near the place by different ways while Remus with equal vigilance gained upon the citizens within Amulius thus beset on all sides and not knowing what expedient to think of for his security was during his amazement and distraicton taken and slain while Numitor who had been deposed fortytwo years recognized his grandsons and was once more restored to the throne  Numitor being thus in quiet possession of the kingdom his grandsons resolved to build a city upon those hills where they had formerly lived as shepherds The king had too many obligations to them not to approve their design he appointed them lands and gave permission to such of his subjects as thought proper to settle in their new colony Many of the neighbouring shepherds also and such as were fond of change repaired to the intended city and prepared to raise it For the more speedy carrying on this work the people were divided into two parts each of which it was supposed would industriously emulate each other But what was designed for an advantage  proved nearly fatal to this infant colony it gave birth to two factions one preferring Romulus the other Remus who themselves were not agreed upon the spot where the city should stand To terminate this difference they were recommended by the king to take an omen from the flight of birds and that he whose omen should be most favourable should in all respects direct the other In compliance with this advice they both took their stations upon different hills to Remus appeared six vultures to Romulus twice that number so that each party thought itself victorious the one having the first omen the other the most numerous This produced a contest which ended in a battle wherein Remus was slain and it is even said that he was killed by his brother who being provoked at his leaping contemptuously over the city wall struck him dead upon the spot at the same time professing that none should ever insult his walls with impunity  Romulus being now sole commander and eighteen years of age began the foundation of a city that was one day to give laws to the world It was called Rome after the name of  the founder and built upon the Palatine hill  on which he had taken his successful omen The city was at first almost square containing about a thousand houses It was near a mile in compass and commanded a small territory  round it of about eight miles over However small as it appears it was notwithstanding worse inhabited and the first method made use of to encrease its numbers was the opening a sanctuary for all malefactors slaves and such as were desirous of novelty These came in great multitudes and contributed to encrease the number of our legislator's new subjects To have a just idea therefore of Rome in its infant state we have only to imagine a collection of cottages surrounded by a feeble wall rather built to serve as a military retreat than for the purposes of civil society rather filled with a tumultuous and vicious rabble than with subjects bred to obedience and controll we have only to conceive men bred to rapine living in a place that merely seemed calculated for the security of plunder and yet to our astonishment we shall soon find this tumultuous concourse uniting in the strictest bonds of society this lawless rabble putting on the most sincere regard for religion and though composed of the dregs of mankind setting examples to all the world of valour and of virtue  CHAP II From the building of Rome to the death of Romulus  SCARCE was the city raised above its foundation when its rude inhabitants began to think of giving some form to their constitution their first object was to unite liberty and empire to form a kind of mixt monarchy by which all power was to be divided between the prince and the people Romulus by an act of great generosity left them at liberty to chuse whom they would for their king and they in gratitude concurred to elect their founder he was accordingly acknowledged as chief of their religion sovereign magistrate of Rome and general of the army Beside a guard to attend his person it was agreed that he should be preceded wherever he went by twelve men armed with axes tied up in a bundle of rods who were to serve as executioners of the law and to impress his new subjects with an idea of his authority Yet still this authority was under very great restrictions as his whole power consisted in calling the senate together in assembling the people in conducting the army when it was decreed by the other part of  the constitution that they should go to war and in appointing the questors or treasurers of the public money officers which we may suppose at that time had but very little employment as neither the soldiers nor magistrates received any pay  The senate which was to act as counsellors to the king was composed of an hundred of the principal citizens of Rome consisting of men whose age wisdom or valour gave them a natural authority over their fellow subjects The king named the first senator and appointed him to the government of the city whenever war required the general's absence In this respectable assembly was transacted all the important business of the state the king himself presiding altho' every question was to be determined by a majority of voices As they were supposed to have a parental affection for the people they were called fathers and their descendants patricians To the patricians belonged all the dignified offices of the state as well as of the priesthood To these they were appointed by the senate and the people while the lower ranks of citizens who were thus excluded from all views of promotion for themselves were to expect advantages only from their valour in war or their assiduity in agriculture  The plebeians who composed the third part of the legislature assumed to themselves the  power of authorising those laws which were pass'd by the king or the senate All things relative to peace or war to the election of magistrates and even to the chusing a king were confirmed by their suffrages In their numerous assemblies all enterprizes against the enemy were proposed while the senate had only a power of rejecting or approving their designs Thus was the state composed of three orders each a check upon the other the people resolved whether the proposals of the king were pleasing to them the senate deliberated upon the expediency of the measure and the king gave vigour and spirit by directing the execution But though the people by these regulations seemed in possession of great power yet there was one circumstance which contributed greatly to its diminution namely the rights of patronage which were lodged in the senate The king sensible that in every state there must be a dependance of the poor upon the powerful gave permission to every plebeian to chuse one among the senators for a patron The bond between them was of the strongest kind the patron was to give protection to his client to assist him with his advice and fortune to plead for him before the judge and to rescue him from every oppression On the other hand the client attached himself to the interests of his patron assisted him if poor to portion his daughters to pay his debts or  his ransom in case of being taken prisoner He was to follow him on every service of danger whenever he stood candidate for an office he was obliged to give him his suffrage and was prohibited from giving testimony in a court of justice whenever his evidence affected the interests of his patron These reciprocal duties were held so sacred that any who violated them were ever after held infamous and excluded from all the protection of the laws so that from hence we see the senate in effect possessed of the suffrages of their clients since all that was left the people was only the power of chusing what patron they should obey Among a nation so barbarous and fierce as the first Romans it was wise to enforce obedience as the most requisite duty  The first care of the newcreated king was to attend to the interests of religion and to endeavour to humanize his subjects by the notion of other rewards and punishments than those of human law The precise form of their worship is unknown but the greatest part of the religion of that age consisted in a firm reliance upon the credit of their soothfayers who pretended from observations on the flight of birds and the entrails of beasts to direct the present and to dive into futurity This pious fraud which first arose from ignorance soon became a most useful machine in the hands of  government Romulus by an express law commanded that no election should be made no enterprize undertaken without first consulting the soothsayers With equal wisdom he ordained that no new divinities should be introduced into public worship that the priesthood should continue for life and that none should be eleccted into it before the age of fifty He forbad them to mix fable with the mysteries of their religion and that they should be qualified to teach others he ordered that they should be the the historiographers of the times so that while instructed by priests like these the people could never degenerate into total barbarity  Of his other laws we have but few fragments remaining In these however we learn that wives were forbid upon any pretext whatsoever to separate from their husbands while on the contrary the husband was empowered to repudiate the wife and even to put her to death with the consent of her relations in ease she was detected in adultery in attempting to poison in making false keys or even of having drank too much wine His laws between children and their parents were yet still more severe the father had entire power over his offspring both of fortune and life he could sell them or imprison them at any time of their lives or in any stations to which they were arrived The father might expose his children if born  with any deformities having previously communicated his intentions to his five next of kindred Our lawgiver seemed more kind even to his enemies for his subjects were prohibited from killing them after they had surrendered or even from selling them his ambition only aimed at diminishing the number of his enemies by making friends of them  After so many endeavours to encrease his subjects and so many laws to regulate them he next gave orders to ascertain their numbers The whole amounted but to three thousand foot and about as many hundred horsemen capable of bearing arms These therefore were divided equally into three tribes and to each he assigned a different part of the city Each of these tribes were subdivided into ten curiae or companies consisting of an hundred men each with a centurion to command it a priest called curio to perform the sacrifices and two of the principal inhabitants called duumviri to distribute justice According to the number of curiae he divided the lands into thirty parts reserving one portion for public uses and another for religious ceremonies The simplicity and frugality of the times will be best understood by observing that each citizen had not above two acres of ground for his own subsistance Of the horsemen mentioned above those were chosen ten from each curia they  were particularly appointed to fight round the person of the king of them his guard was composed and from their alacrity in battle or from the name of their first commander they were called celeres a word equivalent to our light horsemen  A government thus wisely instituted it may be supposed induced numbers to come and live under it each day added to its strength multitudes flock'd in from all the adjacent towns and it only seemed to want women to ascertain its duration In this exigence Romulus by the advice of the senate sent deputies among the Sabines his neighbours entreating their alliance and upon these terms offering to cement the most strict confederacy with them The Sabines who were then considered as the most warlike people of Italy rejected the proposition with disdain and some even added raillery to the refusal demanding that as he had opened a sanctuary for fugitive slaves why he had not also opened another for prostitute women This answer quickly raised the indignation of the Romans and the king in order to gratify their resentment while he at the same time should people his city resolved to obtain by force what was denied to entreaty For this purpose he proclaimed a feast in honour of Neptune throughout all the neighbouring villages and made the most magnificent  preparations for it These feasts were generally preceded by sacrifices and ended in shews of wrestlers gladiators and chariotcourses The Sabines as he had expected were among the foremost who came to be spectators bringing their wives and daughters with them to share the pleasure of the sight The inhabitants also of many of the neighbouring towns came who were received by the Romans with marks of the most cordial hospitality In the mean time the games began and while the strangers were most intent upon the spectacle a number of the Roman youth rushed in among them with drawn swords seized the youngest and most beautiful women and carried them off by violence In vain the parents protested against this breach of hospitality in vain the virgins themselves at first opposed the attempts of their ravishers perseverance and caresses obtained those favours which timidity at first denied so that the betrayers from being objects of aversion soon became partners of their dearest affections  But however the affront might have been borne by them it was not so easily put up by their parents a bloody war ensued The cities of Cenina Antemna and Crustumium were the first who resolved to revenge the common cause which the Sabines seemed too dilatory in pursuing These by making seperate inroads  became a more easy conquest to Romulus who first overthrew the Ceninenses slew their king Acron in single combat and made an offering of the royal spoils to Jupiter Feretrius on the spot where the capitol was afterwards built The Antemnates and Crustuminians shared the same fate their armies were overthrown and their cities taken The conqueror however made the most merciful use of his victory for instead of destroying their towns or lessening their numbers he only placed colonies of Romans in them to serve as a frontier to repress more distant invasions  Tatius king of Cures a Sabine city was the last although the most formidable who undertook to revenge the disgrace his country had suffered He entered the Roman territories at the head of twentyfive thousand men and not content with a superiority of forces he added stratagem also Tarpeia who was daughter to the commander of the Capitoline hill happened to fall into his hands as she went without the walls of the city to fetch water Upon her he prevailed by means of large promises to betray one of the gates to his army The reward she engaged for was what the soldiers wore on their arms by which she meant their bracelets They however either mistaking her meaning or willing to punish her perfidy threw their bucklers upon her as they entered  and crushed her to death beneath them The Sabines being thus possessed of the Capitoline had the advantage of continuing the war at their pleasure and for some time only slight encounters passed between them At length however the tediousness of this contest began to weary out both parties so that each wished out neither would stoop to sue for peace The desire of peace often gives vigour to measures in war wherefore both sides resolving to terminate their doubts by a decisive action a general engagement ensued which was renewed for several days with almost equal success They both fought for all that was valuable in life and neither could think of submitting it was in the valley between the Capitoline and Quirinal hills that the last engagement was fought between the Romans and the Sabines The engagement became general and the slaughter prodigious when the attention of both sides was suddenly turned from the scene of horror before them to another infinitely more striking The Sabine women who had been carried off by the Romans were seen with their hair loose and their ornaments neglected flying in between the combatants regardless of their own danger and with loud outcries only solicitous for that of their parents their husbands and their children  "If" cried they "you are resolved upon slaughter  turn your arms upon us since we only are the cause of your animosity If any must die let it be us since if our parents or our husbands fall we must be equally miserable in being the surviving cause"  A spectacle so moving could not be resisted by the combatants both sides for a while as if by mutual impulse let fall their weapons and beheld the distress in silent amazement The tears and entreaties of their wives and daughters at length prevailed an accommodation ensued by which it was agreed that Romulus and Tatius should reign jointly in Rome with equal power and prerogative that an hundred Sabines should be admitted into the senate that the city should still retain its former name but that the citizens should be called Quirites after Cures the principal town of the Sabines and that both nations being thus united such of the Sabines as chose it should be admitted to live in and enjoy all the privileges of citizens in Rome Thus every storm which seemed to threaten this growing empire only served to encrease its vigour That army which in the morning had resolved upon its destruction came in the evening with joy to be enrolled among the number of its citizens Romulus saw his dominions and his subjects encreased by more than half in the space of a few hours and as if fortune meant every way to  assist his greatness Tatius his partner in the government was killed about five years after by the Lavinians for having protected some servants of his who had plundered them and slain their ambassadors so that by this accident Romulus once more saw himself sole monarch of Rome  Rome being greatly strengthened by this new acquisition of power began to grow formidable to her neighbours and it may be supposed that pretexts for war were not wanting when prompted by jealousy on their side and by ambition on that of the Romans Fidena and Cameria two neighbouring cities were subdued and taken Veii also one of the most powerful states of Etruria shared nearly the same fate after two fierce engagements they sued for peace and a league which was granted upon giving up a seventh part of their dominions their saltpits near the river and hostages for greater security  Successes like these produced an equal share of pride in the conqueror From being cont  nted with those limits which had been wisely fixed to his power he began to affect absolute sway and to govern those laws to which he had himself formerly professed implicit obedience The senate was particularly displeased at his conduct finding themselves only used as instruments to ratify the rigour of his commands We are  not told the precise manner which they made use of to get rid of the tyrant some say that he was torn in pieces in the senatehouse others that he disappeared while reviewing his army certain it is that from the secrecy of the fact and the concealment of the body they took occasion to persuade the multitude that he was taken up into heaven thus him whom they could not bear as a king they were contented to worship as a god  Romulus reigned thirtyseven years and after his death had a temple built to him under the name of Quirinus one of the senators solemnly affirming that he had appeared to him and desired to be invoked by that title We see little more in the character of this prince than what might be expected in such an age great temperance and great valour which generally make up the catalogue of savage virtues However the grandeur of an empire admired by the whole world creates in us an admiration of the founder without much examining his title  CHAP III From the death of Romulus to the death of Numa Pompilius the second king of Rome  ROME was already grown from its small  beginnings into a very formidable state her forces now amounted to fortysix thousand foot and a thousand horse The kingdom of Alba also fell in by the death of Numitor so that it now required some time to unite so great a concourse of newmade subjects into an obedience to one governor in fact the city seemed greatly divided in the choice of a successor The Sabines were for having the king chosen from their body but the Romans could not bear the thoughts of advancing a stranger to the throne In this perplexity the senate undertook to supply the place of the king by taking the government each of them in turn for five days and during that time enjoying all the honours and all the privileges of royalty This new form of government held a year nor is it known whether the senate intended by continuing it to preserve the sovereign power among themselves or only to wait for a proper object of their choice on whom to devolve the regal power The plebeians however who saw  that this method of transferring power was only multiplying their masters insisted upon altering that mode of government allowing the senate a choice either of nominating a king or electing annual magistrates from among their number The senate being thus driven to an election for some time debated upon the proper form till at length it was agreed that the party which elected should nominate from the body of the other so that the new king would have equal attachments to both to the one as his countrymen to the other as his electors In consequence of this the choice being left to the Roman part of the senate they pitched upon Numa Pompilius a Sabine and their choice was received with universal approbation by the rest of the senate and the people  Numa Pompilius who was now about forty had long been eminent for his piety his justice moderation and exemplary life He was skilled in all the learning and philosophy of the Sabines and lived at home at Cures contented with a private fortune unambitious of higher honours It was not therefore without reluctance that he accepted the dignity that was conferred upon him he for some time continued obstinately to refuse it but at length at the request of his father and the persuasions of the ambassadors who were sent  to him from Rome he consented to accept of the kingdom so that his acceptance produced such joy that the people seemed not so much to receive a king as a kingdom  The Romans were fond of thinking that providence industriously adapted the various dispositions of its kings to the different necessities of the people and indeed in the present instance they were not much mistaken No monarch could be more proper for them than Numa at a conjuncture when the government was composed of various petty states  ately subdued and but ill united among each other they wanted a master who could by his laws and precepts soften their fierce dispositions and by his example induce them to a love of religion and every milder virtue Under Numa therefore the people became more submissive and social but what gave them still greater force if considered in the light of conquerors was the spirit of religion which he implanted amongst them This continued to operate through a long succession of ages for what could resist the greatest valour when impelled by the most profound superstition  In the reign of Numa therfore we are to look only for the pacific virtues as his whole time was spent in inspiring his subjects with a love of piety and a veneration for the gods  He built many new temples he instituted feasts and the sanctity of his life gave him credit enough to persuade his people that he had a particular correspondence with the goddess Egeria By her advice he built the temple of Janus which was to be shut in time of peace and open in war he ordained vestal virgins who being four in number had very great privileges allowed them such as of being preceded by the fasces or ensigns of royal power and of pardoning malefactors in case of an accidental meeting he instituted pontiffs and enrolled himself among the number he brought up the orders of the Salian and Fecial priesthood the one to preserve the sacred shields called ancillia which he pretended had dropt down from heaven and which while remaining in Rome the city could never be taken the other to judge of the equity of war and to proclaim it with great ceremony  For the encouragement of agriculture he divided those lands which Romulus had gained in war among the poorer part of the people he abated the rigour of the laws which his predecessor had instituted with regard to parents and children making it unlawful for a father to sell his son after marriage because he thought it unjust that a woman who had married a freeman should be constrained to live with a slave he regulated also the kalendar  and abolished the distinction between Romans and Sabines by dividing the people according to their several trades and compelling them to live together Thus having lived to the age of more than fourscore years and having reigned fortythree in profound peace he died ordering his body to be buried in a stone coffin contrary to the custom of the times and his books of ceremonies which consisted of twelve in Latin and as many in Greek to be buried by his side in another These were taken up about four hundred years after and because it was thought impious to communicate the mysteries they contained to the public they were burnt by order of the senate which perhaps was willing to hide the futility of the work by this extraordinary reverence for the contents  CHAP IV From the death of Numa to the death of Tullus Hostilius the third king of Rome  UPON the death of Numa the government  once more devolved upon the senate and continued with them till the people elected Tullus Hostilius for their king which choice had also the concurrence of the other part of the constitution This monarch who was grandson  to a noble Roman who had formerly signalized himself against the Sabines was every way unlike his predecessor being entirely devoted to war and more fond of enterprize than even the founder of the empire himself had been so that he only sought a pretext for leading his forces to the field  The Albans were the first people who gave him an opportunity of indulging his favourite inclinations Two neighbouring states both eager for war and both in some measure subsisting by plunder can never want a pretext to colour the violence of a first aggression A few Roman shepherds had it seems committed an inroad upon the territories of Alba a number of Alban shepherds had made reprisals upon them ambassadors were sent from either state complaining of the injury no redress was given and a formal war was declared on both sides which neither however would bear the blame of having first given rise to There were indeed many reasons for making these two states unwilling to come to an open rupture they were descended from the same original and the ties of consanguinity still held many of them united There were also some neighbouring states enemies to both that only sought an opportunity of falling upon either It was with these dispositions that after some warlike stratagems on either side the Roman  and Alban forces met about five miles from Rome prepared to decide the fate of their respective kingdoms for almost every battle in these barbarous times was decisive The two armies were for some time drawn out in array awaiting the signal to begin both chiding the length of that dreadful suspense which kept them from death or victory But an unexpected proposal from the Alban general put a stop to the onset for stepping in between both armies he offered the Romans the choice of deciding the dispute by single combat adding that the side whose champion was overcome should submit to the conqueror A proposal like this suited the impetuous temper of the Roman king and was embraced with joy by his subjects each of which hoped that he himself should be chosen to fight the cause of his country Many valiant men offered themselves but could not be accepted to the exclusion of others till at last in this incertitude of choice chance suggested a remedy There were at that time three twin brothers in each army those of the Romans were called Horatii and these of the Albans Curiatii all six remarkable for their courage strength and activity and to these it was resolved to commit the management of the combat When the previous ceremony of oaths and protestations binding the army of the vanquished party to  submit to that of the victorious were over the combatants were led forth amidst the encouragements the prayers and the shouts of their country They were warned of the greatness of the cause they were reminded of their former atchievments they were admonished that their fathers their countrymen and gods were spectators of their behaviour At length warm'd with the importance of the trial the champions on each side met in combat together and totally regardless of his own safety each only sought the destruction of his opponent The spectators in horrid silence trembled at every blow and wished to share the danger till at length fortune seemed to decide the glory of the field Victory that had hitherto been doubtful appeared to declare against the Romans they beheld two of their champions lying dead upon the plain and the three Curiatii who were wounded slowly endeavouring to pursue the survivor who seemed by flight to beg for mercy At this the Alban army unable to suppress their joy raised a loud acclamation while the Romans inwardly cursed and repined at the cowardice of him whom they saw in circumstances of such baseness Soon however they began to alter their sentiments when they perceived that his flight was only pretended in order to separate his antagonists whom he was unable to oppose united for  quickly after stopping his course and turning upon him who followed most closely behind he laid him dead at his feet the second brother who came on to assist him who was fallen only shared the same fate and now there remained but the last Curiatius to conquer who fatigued and quite disabled with his wounds slowly came up to offer an easy victory He was killed almost unresisting while the conqueror exclaiming offered him as a victim to the superiority of the Romans whom now the Alban army consented to obey  A victory so great and attended with such signal effects deserved every honour that Rome could bestow but as if none of the virtues of that age were to be without alloy the very hand that in the morning was exerted to save his country was before night embrued in the blood of a sister For returning triumphant from the field it raised his indignation to behold her bathed in tears and lamenting the loss of her lover one of the Curiatii to whom she was betrothed But when upon seeing the vest which she had made for her lover among the number of his spoils and beginning to upbraid him it provoked him beyond the power of sufferance so that he slew her in a rage This action greatly displeased the senate and drew on the condemnation of the magistrates but he  was pardoned by making his appeal to the people  Things being in this posture Hostilius resolved to avail himself of the late victory by confirming the submission of Alba and taking the proper steps to quell the insolence of the inhabitants of Fidena and Veii who had been making preparations to shake off their subjection His designs were crowned with success in both A victory over the latter restrained their attempts for some time and as to the former having convicted Metius Suffetius their general of treason he caused him to be torn to pieces by horses and still more to give no ground for future revolts he utterly demolished the city of Alba and transplanted the inhabitants to Rome many of whom he admitted into the senate  After these successes he turned his arms against the Sabines over whom he gained a signal victory by means of his cavalry whom the enemy were incapable of withstanding Thus every new war which depopulates other states seemed but to add strength and numbers to that of Rome It was perhaps from a consciousness that a state of war was the best for his people that the king entered into one with the Latins which however was managed but slowly on both sides no battle being fought nor no town taken except Medallia which had formerly  been obliged to accept a Roman colony and was now permitted to be plundered as an example to prevent the like defection in others This war lasted almost the rest of this reign the latter part of which was clouded with terrors from pretended prodigies while at the same time the king saw his people afflicted with a real famine which it was not in his power to relieve He died after a reign of thirtytwo years some say by lightening with his whole family others with more probability by treason  CHAP V From the death of Tullus Hostilius to the death of Ancus Martius the fourth king of Rome  AFTER an interregnum as in the former case  Ancus Martius the grandson of Numa was was elected king by the people and the choice afterwards was confirmed by the senate As this monarch was a lineal descendant from Numa so he seemed to make him the great object of his imitation Indeed he was by nature incapable of making any great figure in war as he took his name of Ancus from the crookedness of one of his arms which he was incapable of extending however he made up this defect by the most diligent application to  all the arts of peace He instituted the sacred ceremonies which were to precede a declaration of war he endeavoured to persuade the people that the calamities which lately befel them and his predecessor were owing to a neglect of the gods he took every occasion to advise his subjects to return to the arts of agriculture and lay aside the less useful stratagems of war  These institutions and precepts were considered by the neighbouring powers rather as marks of cowardice than of wisdom The Latins therefore began to make incursions upon his territories and by their outrages in some measure forced him into a war In this however he still kept up to his character and previously sent an herald who in a peculiar dress and with a javelin headed with iron in his hand went to the confines of the enemy solemnly proclaimed war and then flung his weapon into their territories with all the force he was able The success of this war was equal to its justice Ancus conquered the Latins destroyed their cities removed their inhabitants to Rome and encreased its territories by the addition of part of theirs He quelled also an insurrection of the Veii the Fidenates and the Volscii and over the Sabines he obtained a second triumph  But his victories over the enemy were by no means comparable to his works at home in raising temples fortifying the city making a  prison for malefactors and building a seaport at the mouth of the Tyber called Ostia by which he secured to his subjects the trade of that river and that of the saltpits adjacent Nor was he less careful in encouraging strangers to come and settle with him the privileges which they obtained and the justice which was administered by him to all brought numbers of the most creditable persons from different parts of Italy who not only encreased the riches of his subjects but also tended still more to civilize them Among others of this quality was Lucumon who afterwards took the name of Lucius and became his successor in the kingdom by the name of Lucius Tarquinius This stranger who was a person of great accomplishments as well as of large possessions was very honourably treated by Ancus who probably was the more prejudiced in his favour by an offer Tarquinius had made him of all his fortune for public uses He was accordingly elected into the senate and appointed guardian to the two sons of Ancus who having enriched his subjects and beautified the city died after reigning twentyfour years  CHAP VI From the death of Ancus Martius to the death of Tarquinius Priscus the fifth king of Rome  LUcius Tarquinius Priscus whose original name as has been already observed was Lucumon and who was appointed guardian to the sons of the late king took the surname of Tarquinius from the city Tarquinia from whence he last came His father was a merchant of Corinth who acquired considerable wealth by trade and had settled in Italy upon account of some troubles at home His son Lucumon who inherited his fortune married a woman of family in the city of Tarquinia and as his birth profession and country were contemptible to the nobles of the place by his wife's persuasions he came to settle at Rome where merit only made distinction On his way thither say the historians as he approached the city gate an eagle stooping from above took off his hat and flying round his chariot for some time with much noise put it on again This his wife Tanaquil who it seems was skilled in augury interpreted as a presage that he should one day wear the crown and perhaps  it was this which first fired his ambition to pursue it accordingly being possessed of great riches all his actions and expences seemed to aim at popularity His kind address his frequent invitations and his many benefits gained the esteem and admiration of a simple people who were yet unskilled in the arts of intrigue and never considered the views with which those favours were bestowed  Ancus being dead and the kingdom as usual devolving upon the senate Tarquin used all his power and arts to set aside the children of the late king and to get himself elected in their stead In order to this upon the day appointed for election he contrived to have them sent out of the city and in a set speech to the people in which he urged his friendship for them the fortune he had spent among them and his knowledge of their government he offered himself for their king As there was nothing in this harangue that could be contested it had the desired effect and the people with one consent elected him as their sovereign  A kingdom thus got by intrigue was notwithstanding governed with equity In the beginning of his reign in order to recompence his friends he added an hundred members more to the senate which made them in all three hundred He likewise encreased the  number of vestal virgins from four to seven and laid the first foundations of an amphitheatre for the combats of men and beasts which were afterwards carried to an horrid excess The first shews however were only horseracing and boxing in which men hired for that purpose from Etruria fought with gauntlets for a prize how different these from the combats of a latter age in which two thousand gladiators were seen at once expiring or dead upon the stage  His peaceful studies however were soon interrupted by the inroads of his restless neighbours particularly the Latins over whom he triumphed and whom he forced to beg a peace He then turned his arms against the Sabines who had once more risen up against Rome and had past over the river Tyber upon a bridge in order to plunder the Roman territories and if possible to sack the city Tarquin however soon came up to them on the banks of the river and gave directions to set fire to a large heap of wood that lay by its side and then to throw it in the burning wood floating down the stream set fire to the enemies bridge and intercepted their retreat Nor did he permit them to take measures for opposing him but attacking them with vigour routed their army so that many who escaped the sword were drowned in attempting to cross over while  their bodies and armour floating down to Rome brought news of the victory even before the messengers could arrive  Tarquin resolving not to give them time to recover from this defeat followed them into their own country where by another victory he obliged them to sue for peace which however they did not obtain but at the expence of a considerable part of their territories and of Collatia a large city five miles east of Rome These conquests were followed by several advantages over the Latins from whom he took many towns though without gaining any decisive victory  Tarquin having thus forced his enemies into submission was resolved not to let his subjects corrupt in indolence but undertook several public works for the convenience and embellishment of the city He surrounded it with stronger and larger walls he adorned the forum or marketplace with porticoes he made many sewers to drain the city some of which excite the admiration of travellers to this very day He improved the amphitheatre which his predecessor had begun and laid the foundation of the capitol which however he did not live to finish  In his time also the augurs came into a great encrease of reputation and he found it  his interest to promote the superstition of the people as this was in fact but to encrease their obedience Tanaquil his wife was a great pretender to this art but Accius Naevius was the most celebrated adept of the kind that was ever known in Rome Upon a certain occasion Tarquin being sensible of his want of cavalry had some intentions of adding three new companies of knights to those three that had been formerly instituted by Romulus but he was restrained by the augur who declared that it was forbidden by the gods to alter any of the institutions of their founder The king as the historians say being in a violent passion upon this resolved to try the augur's skill and asked him whether what he was then pondering in his mind could be effected Naevius having examined his auguries boldly affirmed that it might why then cries the king with an insulting smile I had thoughts of cutting this whetstone with a razor Cut boldly replied the augur and the king cut it through accordingly Thence forward nothing was undertaken in Rome without consulting the augurs and obtaining their advice and approbation No assembly was dismissed nor army levied no battle fought nor peace restored without consulting the chirping and the flight of birds which as it may be supposed the augurs made to speak whatever language they pleased  Tarquin was not content with a kingdom without also the ensigns of royalty in imitation of the Lydian kings he assumed a crown of gold an ivory throne a sceptre with an eagle on the top and robes of purple It was perhaps the splendor of these royalties that first raised the envy of the late king's sons who had now for above thirtyseven years quietly submitted to his government His design also of adopting Servius Tullius his soninlaw for his successor might have contributed to enflame their resentment Whatever was the cause of their tardy vengeance they resolved to destroy him and at last found means to effect their purpose by hiring two ruffians who upon pretence of justice demanding to speak with the king struck him dead in his palace with the blow of an ax The lictors however who waited upon the person of the king seized the murderers who were attempting to escape they were put to death but the sons of Ancus who were the instigators found safety by flight  Thus fell Lucius Tarquinius surnamed Priscus to distinguish him from one of his successors of the same name aged fiftysix years of which he had reigned thirtyeight By having been of Greek extraction he in some manner introduced part of the polite arts of that country among his subjects and though  the Romans were as yet very far from being civilized yet they certainly were much more so than any of the barbarous nations round them  CHAP VII From the death of Tarquinius Priscus to the death of Servius Tullius the sixth king of Rome  THE report of the murder of Tarquin filled all his subjects with complaint and indignation while the citizens ran from every quarter to the palace to learn the truth of the account or to take vengeance on the assassins In this tumult Tanaquil widow of the late king considering the danger she must incur in case the conspirators should succeed to the crown and desirous of having her soninlaw for his successor with great art dissembled her sorrow and the king's death She assured the people from one of the windows of the palace that he was not killed but stunned by the blow that he would shortly recover and that in the mean time he had deputed his power to Servius Tullius his soninlaw Servius accordingly as it had been agreed upon between them issued from the palace adorned with the ensigns of royalty and preceded by his lictors went to dispatch some affairs that related to  the public safety still pretending that he took all his instructions from the king This scene of dissimulation continued for some days till he had made his party good among the nobles when the death of Tarquin being publickly ascertained Servius came to the crown solely at the senate's appointment and without attempting to gain the suffrages of the people  Servius was the son of a bondwoman who had been taken at the sacking of a town belonging to the Latins and was born whilst his mother was yet a slave While yet an infant in his cradle a lambent flame is said to have played round his head which Tanaquil converted into an omen of his future greatness Imprest with this opinion she gave him the best education of the times and soon after raised him to the honour of being her soninlaw and appointed him when the king grew old to the management of affairs both of a domestic and foreign nature His conduct in this station gained him the goodwill of the people and what he valued still more the esteem of the senate  Upon being acknowledged as king the chief object of his reign was to encrease the power of the senate by depressing that of the people an enterprize attended with extreme difficulty and danger To compass his intention he was to  work by stratagem and by seeming to study their interest bring about a measure that should effectually destroy their authority The Roman citizens had hitherto been taxed singly and each paid an equal share to the necessities of the state this method of contributing to the public exigencies he pretended to consider as extremely unjust and proposed one of a more equitable kind by which every citizen should be only taxed according to his fortune The populace who were unable to see into his designs received his project with the loudest applause and conferred upon him a full power of settling the taxes as he should think proper To begin therefore he ordered an exact enumeration to be made of the citizens of Rome their children and servants and also a just evaluation of their estates and substance Their numbers were found to amount to above fourscore thousand men capable of bearing arms a vast encrease since the time of Romulus These he divided into six classes in the first of which he comprized the body of the senate the patricians and all those whose fortunes were above eleven hundred thousand asses or about three hundred and sixtysix pounds of our money at that time no contemptible fortune in Rome This class he divided into fourscore centuries or companies  one half of which being composed of the most aged and respectable persons were to remain at home for the defence of the city the other half composed of the youthful and vigorous were to follow the general and to march into the field Their arms were a javelin a spear and a sword their armour a helmet a cuirass and cuishes of brass In this class also was comprized the knights or horsemen which consisted of eighteen centuries with two more of the machinists who followed the camp The second class which consisted but of twentytwo centuries or companies was composed of those who were worth above seventyfive thousand asses these were accoutered in the same manner with the first class only instead of a shield they carried a target The third class consisted of twenty centuries and was composed of such as were worth fifty thousand asses The fourth class consisted of a similar number of centuries and was composed of such as were worth twentyfive thousand asses In the fifth class were thirty centuries and the qualification was eleven thousand asses these were chiefly employed as slingers and irregulars in the army In the last class there was but one century and it seemed considered as of no advantage to the state except by breeding children that might one day be useful These paid no taxes and  were dispensed with from going to war In all these classes as in the first a part consisting of the old men were ordained to remain at home for the defence of the city and the more youthful to fight abroad in their armies Thus the whole number of the citizens were divided into an hundred and ninetythree centuries each commanded by a centurion distinguished by his valour and experience  The citizens being in this manner ranked they were next to be taxed but not as formerly equally and one by one but by centuries each century being obliged to supply an equal share to the exigencies of government By these means as the people were extremely numerous in the centuries of the inferior classes their quota of the tax was proportionably small It cannot be doubted but this partial exemption from taxes was greatly pleasing to the populace but they little considered that they were to purchase it at the expence of their former power For it was but reasonable that as the senators and the rich furnished most to the necessities of the state they should also have a proportionable influence in managing its concerns Accordingly as they paid their taxes by centuries he instituted that they should give their votes in all public transactions by centuries also In former deliberations  each citizen gave his suffrage singly and the numbers of the poor always carried it against the power of the rich but by the regulations of Servius the senate consisting of a greater number of centuries than all the other classes put together now entirely outweighed them in every contention The plebeians in this manner were left but the shadow of authority with which however for some ages they seemed sufficiently contented until the encreasing luxury of the times taught one side the abuse of power and the other a pride that disdained subordination  In order to ascertain the encrease or decay of his subjects and their fortunes he instituted another regulation which he called a lustrum By this all the citizens were to assemble in the Campus Martius in complete armour and in their respective classes once in five years and there to give an exact account of their families and fortune He permitted slaves also to be set free by their masters and caused such as were thus manumitted to be distributed among the lower classes of the city  The king having enjoyed a long reign thus spent in settling the domestic policy of the state and also not unattentive to foreign concerns for he overthrew the Etrurians in many battles and triumphed over them three several times conceived reasonable hopes of concluding  it with tranquility and ease Servius had even thoughts of laying down his power and having formed the kingdom into a republick▪ to retire into obscurity but so generous a design was frustrated ere it could be put in execution  In the beginning of his reign to secure his throne by every precaution he had married his two daughters to the two grandsons of Tarquin and as he knew that the women were of opposite dispositions as well as their intended husbands he resolved to cross their tempers by giving each to him of a contrary turn of temper her that was meek and gentle to him that was bold and furious her that was ungovernable and proud to him that was remarkable for a contrary character by this he supposed that each would correct the failings of the other and that the mixture would be productive only of concord The event however proved otherwise Lucius his haughty soninlaw soon grew displeased with the meekness of his consort and placed his whole affections upon Tullia his brother's wife who answered his passion with sympathetic ardour As their wishes were ungovernable they soon resolved to break through every restraint that offered to prevent their union both undertook to murder their consorts which they effected and were accordingly soon after married together A first crime ever produces a  second from the destruction of their consorts they proceeded to conspiring that of the king They began by raising factions against him alledging his illegal title to the crown and Lucius by claiming it as his own as heir to Tarquin But Tullius by his prudence and great moderation defeated this design in the outset coming off with great honour both with the senate and people which brought Lucius to a feigned repentance on his side and produced a real reconciliation on that of the king Tullia however still continuing to add flame to her husband's ambition which was already all on fire he continued his intrigues among the senate attaching the old to him by putting them in mind of their obligations to his family▪ the young by gifts for the present and promises of much greater things upon his coming to the crown At length when he found them ripe for seconding his views he entered the senate house adorned with all the ensigns of royalty and placing himself upon the throne began to harangue them upon the obscurity of the king's birth and the injustice of his title While he was yet speaking Servius entered attended by a few followers and seeing his throne thus rudely invaded offered to push the usurper from his seat but Tarquin being in the vigour of youth threw the old man down the steps which led to the throne  and some of his adherents being instructed for that purpose followed the king as he was feebly attempting to get to the palace and dispatched him throwing his body all mangled and bleeding as a public spectacle into the street In the mean time Tullia burning with impatience for the event was informed of what her husband had done and resolving to be among the first who should salute him as monarch ordered her chariot to drive to the senatehouse where her savage joy seemed to disgust every beholder Upon her return▪ when her charioteer approached the place where the old king her father's body lay exposed and bloody the man all amazed at the inhuman spectacle and not willing to trample upon it with his horses feet offered to turn another way but this only served to encrease the fierceness of her anger she threw the footstool at his head and ordered him to drive over it without deviation  This was the end of Servius Tullius a prince of eminent justice and moderation after an useful and prosperous reign of fortyfour years Tho' the dominions of Rome had been but little encreased by him yet they acquired a stability under his government which far exceeded the transient splendor of an extensive but hasty conquest  CHAP VIII From the death of Servius Tullius to the Banishment of Tarquinius Superbus the seventh and last king of Rome  LUCIUS Tarquinius afterwards called  Superbus or the proud having placed himself upon the throne in consequence of his violent attempt was resolved to support his dignity with the same violence with which it was acquired Regardless of the senate or the people's approbation he seemed to claim the crown by an hereditary right and refused the late king's body inhumation under pretence of his being an usurper All the good part of mankind however looked upon his accession with detestation and horror and this act of inefficient cruelty only served to confirm their hatred Conscious of this he ordered all such as he suspected to have been attached to Servius to be put to death and fearing the natural consequences of his tyranny encreased the guard round his person  His chief policy seems to have been to keep the people always employed either in wars or public works by which means he diverted their attention from his unlawful method of  coming to the crown With this view he first marched against the Sabines who refused to pay him obedience and soon reduced them to submission He next began a war with the Volsci which continued for some ages after and from these he took Su  ssa Dometia a considerable town about twentysix miles east of Rome The city of the Gabii gave him much more trouble for having attempted with some loss to besiege it he was obliged to direct his efforts by stratagem▪ contrary to the usual practice of the Romans He caused his son Sextus to counterfeit desertion upon pretence of barbarous usage from his father and to seek refuge among the inhabitants of the place There by artful complaints and studied lamentations he so prevailed upon the pity of the people as to be chosen their governor and soon after general of their army He at first in every engagement appeared successful till at length finding himself entirely possessed of the confidence of the state he sent a trusty messenger to his father for instructions Tarquin made no other answer than taking the messenger into the garden and cutting down before him the tallest poppies Sextus readily understood the meaning of this reply and one by one found means of destroying or removing the principal men of the city still taking care to confiscate their effects among the people  The charms of this dividend kept the giddy populace blind to their approaching ruin till they found themselves at last without counsellors or head and in the end fell under the power of Tarquin without even striking a blow After this he made a league with the Aequi and renewed that with the Etrurians  But while he was engaged in wars abroad he took care not to suffer the people to continue in idleness at home He undertook to build the capitol the foundation of which had been laid in a former reign and an extraordinary event contributed to hasten the execution of his design A woman in strange attire made her appearance at Rome and came to the king offering to sell nine books which she said were of her own composing Not knowing the abilities of the seller and that she was in fact one of the celebrated sybils whose prophecies were never found to fail Tarquin refused to buy them Upon this she departed and burning three of her books again demanded the same price for the six remaining being despised as an impostor she again departed and burning three more returned with those remaining still asking the same as at first Tarquin surprized at the inconsistency of her behaviour consulted the augurs to advise him what to do These much blamed him for not buying the nine and commanded him to buy  the three remaining at whatsoever price she should demand The woman says the historian after thus selling and delivering the three prophetic volumes and advising him to have a special attention to what they contained vanished from before him and was never after seen Upon this he chose proper persons to keep them who though but two at first were afterwards encreased to fifteen under the name of quindecemviri They were put into a stone chest and a vault in the newlydesigned building was thought the properest place to keep them in safety so that the work went on with great vigour and as omens and prodigies were frequent in this ignorant age in digging the foundations a man's head named Tolus was found which though he was many years dead still bled afresh as if he had been but newly slain This gave the building the name of capitol caput Toli It was two hundred feet long two hundred high and almost as many broad dedicated to Jupiter in chief but containing two temples more under the same roof dedicated to Juno and Minerva A structure so magnificent was in some measure an indication of the encrease of arts in Rome not less than of the piety of the people  However the time now began to approach in which the people were to be freed from a tyrant who day after day made new victims  among them Having been now for four years together employed in building the capitol they began at last to wish for something new to engage them wherefore Tarquin to satisfy their wishes proclaimed war against the Rutuli upon a frivolous pretence of their having entertained some malefactors whom he had banished and invested their chief city Ardea which lay about sixteen miles from Rome While the army was encamped before this place the king's son Sextus with Collatinus a noble Roman and some others sat in a tent drinking together the discourse happening to turn upon the beauty and virtue of their wives each man praising his own Collatinus offered to decide the dispute by putting it to an immediate trial whose wife should be found possest of the greatest beauty and most sedulously employed at that very hour Being heated with wine the proposal was relished by the whole company and taking horse without delay they posted to Rome though the night was already pretty far advanced Here they found Lucretia the wife of Collatinus not like the other women of the age spending the time in ease and luxury but spinning in the midst of her maids and chearfully portioning out their tasks Her modest beauty and the easy reception she gave her husband and his friends so charmed them all that they unanimously  gave her the preference and Sextus was so much inflamed that nothing but enjoyment could satisfy his passion  He went therefore from the camp to visit her privately a few days after and received the same kind reception which he had met with before As his intentions were not suspected Lucretia sate with him at supper and ordered a chamber to be got ready for him in the house Midnight was the time in which this ruffian thought it safest to put his designs in execution Having found means to convey himself into her chamber he approached her bedside with a drawn sword and rudely laying his hand upon her bosom threatened her with instant death if she offered to resist his passion Lucretia affrighted out of her sleep and seeing death so near was however inexorable to his desire till being told that if she would not yield he would first kill her and then laying his own slave dead by her side he would report that he had killed them thus in the act of adultery The terror of infamy atchieved what that of death could not obtain she consented to his desire and the next morning he returned to the camp exulting in his brutal victory In the mean time Lucretia detesting the light and resolving not to pardon herself for the crime of another sent for her husband Collatinus and for Spurius her father to come to  her as an indelible disgrace had befallen the family These instantly obeyed the summons bringing with them Valerius a kinsman of her father's and Junius Brutus a reputed ideot whose father Tarquin had murdered and who had accidentally met the messenger by the way Their arrival only served to encrease Lucretia's poignant anguish they found her in a state of steadfast desperation and vainly attempted to give her relief  "No said she never shall I find any thing worth living for in this life after having lost my honour You see my Collatinus a polluted wretch before you one whose person has been the spoil of another but whose affections were never estranged from you Sextus under the pretended veil of friendship has this night forced from me that treasure which death only can restore but if you have the hearts of men remember to avenge my cause and let posterity know that she who has lost her virtue had only death for her best consolation"  So saying she drew a poignard from beneath her robe and instantly plunging it in her bosom exspired without a groan The whole company remained for some time fixed in sorrow pity and indignation Spurius and Collatinus at length gave a vent to their grief in tears but Brutus drawing the poignard reeking from Lucretia's wound and lifting it up towards Heaven  "Be witness ye Gods he cried that from this moment I proclaim myself the avenger of the chaste Lucretia's cause from this moment I profess myself the enemy of Tarquin and his lustful house from henceforth shall this life while life continues be employed in opposition to tyranny and for the happiness and freedom of my much loved country"  A new amazement seized the hearers to find him whom they had heretofore considered as an ideot now appearing in his real character the friend of justice and of Rome He told them that tears and lamentations were unmanly when vengeance called▪ so loud and delivering the poignard to the rest imposed the same oath upon them which he himself had just taken  Junius Brutus was the son of Marcus Junius a noble Roman who was married to the daughter of Tarquinius Priscus and for that reason through a motive of jealousy was put to death by Tarquin the Proud Junius Brutus the son had received an excellent education from his father and had from nature strong sense and an inflexible attachment to virtue but perceiving that Tarquin had privily murdered his father and his eldest brother he counterfeited himself a fool in order to escape the same danger and thence obtained the surname of Brutus Tarquin thinking his folly real despised  the man and having possessed himself of his estate kept him as an ideot in his house merely with a view of making sport for his children It happened in a time of threatened danger that Brutus was sent with Tarquin's two sons to consult the oracle upon the methods expedient to avert the calamity The sons were pleased with his company and laughed to see him offer his staff at the shrine of Apollo which however was a much more valuable present to the god than theirs as it had been made hollow and then filled with gold The young men after executing their father's commands next enquired of the oracle which of them should be king of Rome to which it was answered that he who should first kiss his mother should gain the kingdom In consequence of this they both resolved to kiss their mother at the same time and thus reign together Brutus however who dived into the real meaning of the oracle as soon as they were arrived in Italy pretended accidentally to fall down and kissing the earth saluted her which he considered as the general parent of all From that time he conceived hopes of being the deliverer of his country and chacing the tyrant Tarquin and his whole family from Rome  Brutus having now the fairest opportunity of ridding his country of a tyrant that had long  harrassed it with impunity procured with all expedition the gates of the city to be shut till such time as the people would be assembled and a public decree for Tarquin's banishment should be attempted Accordingly he caused Lucretia's dead body to be brought out to view and exposed in the public forum while the citizens who ran tumultuously from old quarters to see it were at first impressed with pity which soon after changed into rage and ungovernable fury this was the disposition which he had so often longed for in vain and now therefore enflaming their ardour by a display of the horrid transaction and still more by the glorious hopes of future freedom he obtained a decree of the senate that Tarquin and his family should be for ever banished from Rome and that it should be capital for any to plead for or attempt his future return Tarquin in the mean time having heard of these commotions at the army flew with the utmost expedition to Rome in hopes to quell and punish the delinquents but finding the gates shut and the walls full of armed men he prepared to return fill'd with indignation to the camp but Brutus had taken care here also to prevent him for expeditiously getting to the army by another road he acquainted the soldiers with what had been done in the city how Lucretia was abused and fallen and how  the senate and people had espoused her quarrel The same sentiments of humanity which had impelled the citizens touched the army also They agreed to act with their friends at home and when Tarquin came back they refused to admit him Thus this monarch who had now reigned twentyfive years being expelled his kingdom went to take refuge with his family at Cira a little city of Etruria In the mean time the Roman army made a truce with the enemy and Brutus was proclaimed deliverer of the people  Thus ended with Tarquin the regal state of Rome after it had continued two hundred and fortyfive years and still with a gradual tho' slow increase Although at the time of Tarquin's expulsion the territory of the Romans was not above forty miles long and thirty broad yet their government was possessed of that vigour which bodies of a slow growth are generally found to enjoy nor were they at any time masters of greater territory than they had forces to keep in obedience Few histories can shew a succession of kings replete with more virtue and moderation than those who first governed in Rome it was from their wise institutions that the people seemed to acquire all that courage that piety and that patriotism which afterwards operated in conquering mankind Their subjects might have been possessed  of all the rustic fierceness of the times indeed but it must have been owing to the monarchs only that their very enemies reaped the benefit of their victories it must have been the general's virtue alone that could protect those whom the soldiers valour had subdued The Grecian legislators had the Egyptians to imitate but the Romans were placed in the midst of nations far more barbarous than themselves and all the wisdom of their monarchs was chiefly of their own formation Hitherto however we only see the genius of the nation making faint struggles to get free from her native ferocity obstructed by custom at home and barbarous example abroad yet still upon particular occasions exerting a nobleness of mind still aiming at imagined virtue and majestic even in infancy  CHAP IX From the banishment of Tarquin to the appointment of the first dictator  THE regal power being overthrown a form of government nominally republican was substituted in its room The senate however reserved by far the greatest share of the authority to themselves and decorated their own  body with all the spoils of deposed monarchy The centuries of the people chose from among the senators instead of a king two annual magistrates whom they called consuls with power equal to that of the regal and with the same privileges and the same ensigns of authority Though the liberty of the people was but very little encreased by this institution yet to it Rome afterwards in a great measure owed its unequalled grandeur In the life of a king there are many periods of indolence and of passion that serve to divert him from the public good but in a commonwealth governed by magistrates annually chosen each has no time to lose and to attain his ambition all his exertions must be within the year Hence it is that those magistrates were ever persuading to some new war and pointing out fresh enemies every day The people thus kept in continual alarms attained a more perfect knowlede of the military arts and were better enabled to adopt the improvements of the various nations they were led to engage  Brutus the deliverer of his country and Collatinus the husband of Lucretia were chosen first consuls in Rome They immediately revived the laws for assembling the people which had been discontinued during the late tyrant's reign but that their newly acquired liberty should be prevented from degenerating into licentiousness  several officers relative to the priesthood were appointed and new sacrifices ordained  This new republick however which seemed so grateful to the people had like to have been destroyed in its very commencement A party was formed in Rome in favour of Tarquin Some young men of the principal families in the state who had been educated about the king and had shared in all the luxu  es and pleasures of the court undertook to reestablish monarchy They were disgusted with the gloomy austerity of a republican fo  of government in which the laws inflexible and severe made no distinctions of birth or fortune This party secretly encreased every day and what may create our surprize the sons of Brutus himself and the Aquilii the nephews of Collatinus were among the number Tarquin who was informed of these intrigues in his favour was resolved to advance them by every art in his power and accordingly sent ambassadors from Etruria to Rome under a pretence of reclaiming the crown and demanding the effects which he had left behind him but in reality with a design to give spirit to his faction and to draw over to it as many as he could They accordingly went on with success holding their private meetings at the house of one of the conspirators and already the restoration of the king and the death of the consuls was  resolved upon However their treason could not be long concealed▪ a slave who had accidentally hid himself in the room where the conspirators used to assemble overheard their conversation and laid open their whole design to the consuls who gave orders to have the conspirators secured and brought before them among whom were the sons of Brutus Few situations could have been more terribly affecting than this of a father placed as a judge upon the life and death of his own children impelled by justice to condemn and by nature to spare them The young men accused pleaded nothing for themselves but with conscious guilt awaited their sentence in silence and agony The other judges who were present felt all the pangs of nature Collatinus wept and Valerius could not repress the sentiments of pity Brutus alone seemed to have lost all the softness of humanity and with a stern countenance and a tone of voice that marked his gloomy resolution demanded of his sons if they could make any defence to the crimes with which they had been charged This demand he made three several times and having received no answer he at length turned himself to the executioner now cried he it is your part to perform the rest thus saying he again resumed his seat with an air of determined majesty nor could all the sentiments of paternal pity nor all the imploring looks of the people  nor yet the complaints of the young men who were preparing for execution al  er the tenor of his resolution The executioners having stripped them naked and then whipped them with  ils presently after beheaded them Brutus all the time beholding the cruel spectacle with a steady look and unaltered countenance while the multitude gazed on with all the sensations of pity terror and admiration  The constancy of Brutus during the  ution of his two sons served greatly to encrease his authority in Rome but the lenity of his colleague Collatinus was considered in a very different light his having attempted to save the Vitellii his nephews rendered him suspected to the citizens he was accordingly deposed from the consulship and banished Ro  ▪ and Valerius afterwards surnamed Publicola from his regard to the people was elected consul in his room  All Tarquin's hopes of an insurrection in the city in his favour being thus overthrown he was now resolved to force himself upon his former throne by foreign assistance and to that end prevailed upon the Veians to assist him and with a considerable army advanced towards Rome  The consuls were not remiss in preparations to oppose him Valerius commanding the foot and Brutus being appointed to head the cavalry  went out to meet him on the Roman borders Aruns the son of Tarquin who commanded the cavalry for his father seeing Brutus at a distance was resolved by one great attempt to decide the fate of the day before the engaging of the armies wherefore spurring on his horse he made toward him with ungovernable fury Brutus who perceived his approach singled out from the ranks to meet him and and both met with such rage that eager only to assail and thoughtless of defending they both fell dead upon the field together A bloody battle ensued with equal slaughter on both sides but the Romans remaining in possession of the field of battle claimed the victory in consequence of which Valerius returned in triumph to Rome  Brutus being thus removed without having compleated his year Valerius continued for some time to enjoy the dignity without a colleague which excited the jealousies of the people who were apprehensive that he had thoughts of aspiring to the crown A palace which he had built with some magnificence upon an eminence augmented these suspicions and it was reported that he had intentions of converting it into a fortress in order to awe the city Valerius however soon quieted their fears by ordering his palace to be pulled down and to shew the rectitude of his intentions made  several laws abridging the power of the senate and extending that of the people By one he allowed an appeal from the consuls to the people by another he made it death for any man to assume the office of magistrate without the people's consent a third gave power to any man to kill the person unheard who affected the supreme power if he could demonstrate the crime He also appointed questors or treasurers who were to have the management of the government's money and the care of accommodating ambassadors Still more to ingratiate himself with the public he ordered the rods which the lictors carried to be separated from the axes intimating thereby that the power of capitally punishing lay no longer in the consuls but the people Having thus satisfied their scruples he chose Lucretius the father of Lucretia for his colleague in the consulship Dying a short time after he was succeeded by Horatius and the time of annual election coming on soon after Valerius was chosen a second time and with him Lucretius who numbered the people They were found to amount to an hundred and thirty thousand besides widows and orphans  In the mean time Tarquin no way intimidated by his misfortunes still formed alliances to assist him in regaining the crown and prevailed upon Porsenna one of the kings of Etruria  to espouse his cause and in person undertake his quarrel This prince equally noted for courage and conduct marched directly to Rome with a numerous army and laid siege to the city while the terror of his name and his arms fill'd all ranks of people with dismay The senate in this exigence did all that prudence could suggest both to quiet the fears and satisfy the wants of the people They ordered that the populace should pay no taxes to the state during the continuance of the war alledging that they did enough in educating children to defend it Still more they purchased corn over various parts of Campania and had it brought to Rome to be distributed at a low price to the people These indulgences linked the orders of the state so firmly together that every citizen seemed resolved to defend his country to the last and save Rome or expire in its ruins The siege however was carried on with vigour a furious attack was made upon the place the two consuls opposed in vain and were carried off wounded from the field while the Romans flying in great consternation were pursued by the enemy to the bridge over which both victors and vanquished were about to enter the city in the confusion All now appeared lost and over when Horatius Cocles who had been placed there as centinel to defend it opposed himself to the torrent of the enemy  and assisted only by two more for some time sustained the whole fury of the assault till the bridge was broken down behind him when plunging with his arms into the torrent of the Tyber he swam back victorious to his fellowsoldiers  Still however Porsenna was determined upon taking the city and though five hundred of his men were slain in a sally of the Romans he reduced it to the greatest straights and turning the siege into a blockade resolved to take it by famine The distress of the besieged soon began to be insufferable and all things seemed to threaten a speedy surrender when another act of fierce bravery still superior to that which had saved the city before again procured its safety and freedom  Mutius a youth of undaunted bravery was resolved to rid his country of an enemy that so sorely continued to oppress it and for this purpose disguised in the habit of an Etrurian peasant entered the camp of the enemy resolved to die or to kill the king With this resolution he made up to the place where Porsenna was paying his troops with a secretary by his side but mistaking the latter for the king he stabbed him to the heart and was immediately apprehended and brought back to the royal presence Upon Porsenna's demanding who he was and the cause of so heinous an  action Mutius without reserve informed him of his country and his design and at the same time thrusting his right hand into a fire that burnt upon an altar before him  "You see" cried he "how little I regard the severest punishment your cruelty can inflict upon me A Roman knows not only how to act but to suffer I am not the only person you have to fear three hundred of the Roman youth like me have conspired your destruction therefore prepare for their attempts"  Porsenna amazed at so much intrepidity had too noble a mind not to acknowledge merit though found in an enemy he therefore ordered him to be safely conducted back to Rome and offered the besieged conditions of peace These were readily accepted on their side being neither hard nor disgraceful except that twenty hostages were demanded ten young men and as many virgins of the best families in Rome But even in this instance also as if the gentler sex were resolved to be sharers in the desperate valour of the times Clelia one of the hostages escaping from her guards and pointing out the way to the rest of her female companions swam over the Tyber on horseback amidst showers of darts from the enemy and presented herself to the consul This magistrate however fearing the consequences of detaining  her had her sent back upon which Porsenna not to be outdone in generosity not only gave her liberty but permitted her to chuse such of the hostages of the opposite sex as she should think fit to attend her On her part she with all the modesty of a Roman virgin chose only such as were under fourteen alledging that their tender age was least capable of sustaining the rigours of slavery  Little remarkable happened after this for about five years if we except two or three victories obtained over the Sabines who were obliged to purchase a peace and over whom the consuls obtained two triumphs and the first ovation that had been seen in Rome which differed from a triumph in these respects that in an ovation the general entered the city on foot and not as in the other case in a chariot that he was met only by the knights and patricians and not by the senators in their robes that his dress was less magnificent and that his crown instead of being of lawrel was made only of myrtle Posthumius who overcame the Sabines was the first who was decreed this lesser kind of triumph because his success was not obtained but at the expence of a former defeat Some other victories followed but we will not dilate upon these small advantages which though they contributed to extend the empire are at present attended neither with curiosity nor instruction  Tarquin though often disappointed was still unsubdued and unshaken By means of his soninlaw Manilius he stirred up the Latins to espouse his interest and took the most convenient opportunity when the plebeians and senators were divided amongst each other to make head against Rome After having united twentyfour towns in his confedracy abroad he by large bribes found means to win over a very powerful party of the poorer sort of citizens from their new government who also had many real causes of discontent to disgust them and to which they soon after gave vent  The Romans under their kings had only  two ways of subsisting by agriculture and by plunder they lived either by labouring their own lands or by reaping the harvests which had been sown by their enemies Soon however after the extinction of royalty the senators and patricians who were in effect sovereigns of the country appropriated to themselves the greatest part of the lands which were the rights of conquest and insensibly extended their own possessions at the expence of the public In vain the soldier fought to enlarge the limits of the dominions of Rome the great came in and shared the fruit of his labour tho' they had no participation in the danger  The poverty of the soldier by these means obliged him to borrow money upon usury and as that was exorbitant it only served to encrease his wretchedness The laws also of Rome permitted the creditor to seize the person of the insolvent debtor and to employ him as a slave till the debt was paid this complication of misery soon excited the murmurs of the poor till from entreaties to their masters they proceeded to menaces The attempt of Tarquin to regain the crown seemed to them a favourable conjuncture to regain those rights of which they had been insensibly deprived When the consuls therefore came to levy men in order to oppose him to their great amazement all the poor and all who were loaded with debt refused to enlist declaring that those who enjoyed the advantages of peace might undergo the fatigues of war but that for their part they were wearied with exposing their lives for nothing or for what was still worse for masters who undervalued their labours and only rioted upon their distress They acknowledged no city nor country they said which would not give them protection and by leaving Rome they only left behind them their miseries their oppressors and their debts They therefore insisted that their debts should be cancelled by a decree of the senate as the only means of inducing them to the field At first the senate  endeavoured to appease the populace by gentle methods but finding these unsuccessful they entered into a serious consideration upon so important an affair There were some for a free remission of all debts as the safest and securest method at that juncture Others urged the dangerous consequences of this condescension advising that only such should be enlisted as thought fit to give in their names and that the rest should be treated with contempt At length they came to a resolution to put off the impending evil by delay and to publish an order that no debtor should be molested during the continuance of the war The people however to whom the senate offered this suspension as a favour refused it with acrimony and contempt They knew that this was only putting off that grievance which would soon fall upon them with encreased severity they knew that the approach of the enemy had extorted from the senate what they would resume when their terrors should be over and therefore they still persisted in their demands The number of the malecontents encreased every hour and many of the people who were neither poor nor involved in debt entered into and shared their griefs either from a consciousness of the rectitude of their demands or from the natural dislike which all men have to their superiors In this exigence therefore the senate who saw the  commonwealth upon the brink of ruin had recourse to an expedient which though successful for the present in a course of ages was fatal to the republick of Rome The consuls finding their authority insufficient offered the people to elect a temporary magistrate who should have absolute power not only over all ranks of state but even over the laws themselves To this the plebeians who held the senate in abhorrence readily consented willing to give up their own power for the sake of abridging that of their superiors In consequence of this Largius was created the first Dictator of Rome for so was this high office called being nominated to it by his colleague in the consulship Thus the people who could not bear to hear the name of king even mentioned readily submitted to a magistrate possessed of much greater power so much do the names of things mislead us and so little is any form of government irksome to people when it coincides with their prejudices This was the first intermission of the consular power about ten years after it had been established  CHAP X From the creation of the first dictator to the election of the tribunes of the people  LARGIUS being now created dictator entered  upon his office surrounded with his lictors and all the ensigns of ancient royalty and seated upon a throne in the midst of the people ordered the levies to be made in the manner of the kings of Rome The populace looked with terror upon a magistrate whom they had invested with uncontroulable power and peaceably went each to range himself under his respective standard The Latins being informed of this change in the government of the city began to lose all the expectations which they had conceived from its divisions they accordingly thought proper to listen to an accommodation which was proposed on the side of Rome and a truce was agreed upon between them for a year Largius who had been sent to oppose the enemy returned with his army to Rome and before his six months were out the time limited for this office he laid down the dictatorship with the reputation of having exercised it with blameless lenity  It seems however that the year ensuing there was occasion for another dictator as we find Posthumius invested with that office and leading out the Romans to prosecute the war with the Latins upon expiration of the truce between them We are told that coming up with them near the lake Regillus he gave them a complete overthrow though they were almost double his number and that scarce a fourth of their army escaped alive from the field It would be unimproving however and tedious to give the particulars of the engagements of this warlike people in the infancy of their empire while yet they seem but the tumultuary meetings of brave but obstinate men whose valour alone rather than conduct decided the fortune of the day In this battle we are particularly told that the dictator cast  e of the ensigns among the enemy to incite his men to a bold attempt for the recovery we are told also that the bridles were ordered to be taken off the horses that they might charge with greater fury Generals who could give such directions might have been bold men but very bad commanders Nevertheless they fought against an enemy more ignorant than themselves so that the Latins ac  nowledging their superiority implored a truce once more and the dictator after a triumph laid down his authority  The soldiers having now once more returned from the field in triumph had some reason to expect a remission of their debts and to enjoy that safety for themselves which they had procured for the public However contrary to their hopes the courts of justice were opened against them and the prosecution of creditors revived with more than former acrimony This began to excite fresh murmurs and the senate who were sensible of them in order to be prepared chose Appius Claudius a man of austere manners a strict observer of the laws and of unshaken intrepidity for one of the consuls the year ensuing but at the same time to temper his severity they gave him for a colleague Servilius a man of an humane and gentle disposition and as much loved by the populace as Appius was hateful to them When the complaints of the people therefore came to be deliberated upon these two magistrates as it may be supposed were entirely of opposite opinions Servilius commiserating the distresses of the poor was for abolishing all debts or at least for diminishing the interest upon them Appius on the other hand with his natural severity insisted that the laws of his country should be inviolably observed and that lightening the load from those who owed money was but throwing it upon those to whom it was due That it would be encouraging the extravagant  and the idle at the expence of the industrious and the frugal and that every new compliance from the senate would but encrease the insolent demands of the people  The populace being apprized of the different opinions of their consuls concerning their complaints loaded Servilius with every mark of gratitude while they every where pursued Appius with threats and imprecations They now therefore began to assemble afresh to hold secret cabals by night and to meditate some new revolution when an unlooked for spectacle of distress rouzed all their passions and at once fanned their kindling resentment into flame  A Roman soldier who seemed in age came to take refuge in the midst of the people loaden with chains yet shewing in his air the marks of better days he was covered with rags his face was pale and wasted with famine his beard which was long and neglected and his hair in wild disorder rendered his appearance still more ghastly He was known however to have once performed gallant services in the field he shewed the scars which he had received in battle and the marks of recent stripes which still continued bleeding The compassion of the multitude was excited at this spectacle but much more when he told them his story Having borne arms in the last war against the Sabines his little patrimony was not only neglected but the enemy  had plundered his substance and set his house on fire He was thus forced for subsistence to contract debts and then obliged to sell his inheritance to discharge them but a part still remaining unpaid his unfeeling creditor had dragged him to prison where he was not only loaded with chains but torn with the whips of the executioner who was ordered to torment him This account and his wounds which were still fresh produced an instantaneous uproar among the people they flew to take revenge not only on the delinquent but on the general body of their oppressors Appius had the fortune to procure safety by flight Servilius laying aside the marks of consular power threw himself into the midst of the tumult entreated flattered commanded them to patience engaged to have their wrongs redressed by the senate promissed that he himself would warmly support their cause and in the mean time to convince them of his good intentions made proclamation that no citizen should be arrested for debt until the senate should issue further directions  The remonstrances of Servilius for this time served in some measure to appease their murmurs and the senate was going to begin their deliberations when word was brought that an army of Volscians was marching directly towards Rome This was an event which the  people had wished with the most ardent expectation and they now resolved to let the nobles see how little the power of the rich avails when unsupported by the strength of the multitude Accordingly when the levy came to be made for soldiers they unanimously refused to enlist while those who had been imprisoned for debt shewing their chains asked with an insulting smile whether these were the weapons with which they were to face the enemy  Rome in this state of anarchy within and of threatened invasion from without was upon the brink of ruin when Servilius who as consul was to command the army once more renewed his entreaties with the people not to desert him in this exigence To sooth them still more he issued a new edict that no citizen should be imprisoned during the continuance of the war and assured them that upon their return they should have plenary redress By these promises as well as by the affection which the people had to his person he once more prevailed The citizens came in crowds to enrol themselves under his command he led them to meet the enemy and gained a compleat victory But of all those who shewed their courage in the engagement the debtors and former malecontents were the most conspicuous Servilius to recompence their bravery gave them the plunder of the enemies camp without reserving as was  usual any part of it to the treasury and this perhaps was the cause which induced the senate upon his return to refuse him the honours of a triumph  No sooner were the terrors of the enemy removed but the former cruelties began afresh Appius still fierce and uncomplying again authorized creditors to renew their rights and debtors were dragged to prison and insulted as before In vain did they implore the assistance of Servilius who gentle and wavering deputed too much of his power to Appius In vain did they claim the promises made them by the senate that body deaf to their cries saw debtors pursued even into the Forum by their merciless masters and prevented only by the multitude from being haled to prison The approach of an enemy still more numerous than that which had been lately conquered retarded the acrimony of their vengeance The Sabines the Equi and the Volscians as if willing to second the views of the people again made a fierce irruption while the citizens refused to touch a weapon till their grievances were removed  Things being in this dangerous situation the senate were obliged to have recourse to the old method of redress by creating a dictator Appius who advised the measure hoped that he himself should have been chosen but the senate  sensible that so much power in the hands of on  so violent in the use of that which he possessed would be dangerous chose Marius Valerius an ancient senator one mild merciful much loved by the people and descended from the great deliverer whose name he bore Valerius who secretly inclined to the plebeian party chose Quintus the brother of their great idol Servilius for his master of the horse and assembling the orders assured them that if they would follow him freely their grievances should not only be redressed but their fortunes advanced by the spoils of the enemy He in the mean time freed them from any immediate prosecutions from their creditors and commanded them to follow him to the field There was something so absolute in the office of a dictator and it was so much considered by the people that they not only dreaded its resentment but seemed to think its promises binding They therefore enrolled themselves at his order and marching against the enemy quickly reduced them to obedience such lands as had been taken from them being divided among the soldiers  Upon his return the dictator requested the senate to perform what he had so solemnly pledged his word to obtain but Appius still obstinate refused to comply reproaching him with a mean condescension to the multitude and bringing over the majority of the senate to his opinion  Valerius therefore finding he was unable to contend with so powerful a body laid down his office alledging that it was time for an old man of seventy as he was to think rather of ease than opposition  The people were now inflamed beyond all bearing they entered into private consultations and formed a plan of separating themselves from masters whose promises were as contemptible as their tyranny dreadful The most violent measures are to the multitude always the most pleasing and some had even the boldness to talk of killing such as were obnoxious The senate and the consuls well knowing the effects of their fury when they should be disbanded resolved still to keep them in the field under pretence that the enemy was yet unsubdued and preparing for new invasions In this exigence the soldiers were at a loss how to act the military oath which they had taken upon listing forbade their laying down their arms or forsaking their standards and yet their recent injuries restrained them from taking the field They steered between both extremes they resolved to quit a city which gave them no shelter and to form a new establishment without its limits They therefore removed their ensigns changed their commanders and under the conduct of a plebeian named Sicinius Bellutus they retired to a mountain from thence called  the Mons Sacer on the banks of the river Anio within about three miles from Rome  Upon news of this defection the city was filled with tumult and consternation those who wished well to the army made all the attempts they could to scale the walls in order to join it for the gates were shut by the senate's direction The fathers who had sons among the mutineers reproached their degeneracy wives lamented the absence of their husbands and all apprehended a civil war The senate was not less agitated than the rest some were for violent measures and repelling force by force others were of opinion that gentler arts were to be used and that even a victory over such enemies would be worse than a defeat At length therefore it was resolved to send a messenger entreating the army to return home and declare their grievances promising at the same time an oblivion of all that had passed This message which in fact was premature to be attended with any effect was treated by the army with disdain so that the senate were now to begin afresh to consider of the proper steps to be taken and whether force or condescension was the wisest course to pursue  Accordingly after chusing new consuls tho' not without difficulty as none at first would offer for the office they entered upon the deliberation with an earnestness equal to the importance  of the cause Menenius Agrippa one of the wisest and best of the senators was of opinion that the people were to be complied with that the Roman Dominions could neither be extended or preserved without them The late dictator Valerius seconded his opinion with a warmth unusual to one of his advanced age He upbraided the Senate with their duplicity and urged the necessity of letting the people into a share of those advantages which the rich seemed willing to engross Appius on the other hand still adhering to his principles declaimed with great force against making the smallest concessions to the multitude He observed that if they granted to the people when enemies what they had refused them when friends it would be an argument of their fears and not their justice That the young Patricians and their clients were still able to defend the city even though its ungrateful inhabitants should think fit to desert it that the multitude never knows where to stop in its demands and that every concession would be only productive of fresh claims and louder importunities The body of the senators to whom chiefly the people were debtors only wanted the speciousness of such arguments to cover their avarice those of the younger sort also who were flattered by the orator applauded his speech with indecent zeal The consuls therefore who notwithstanding this  shew of a debate saw the necessity there was of complying with the people in order to prevent such violent measures as the senate were hastening into for that day broke up the assembly at the same time intimating to the younger part of the senators that if they did not behave with more moderation for the future a law should be preferred preventing all under a certain age from being admitted into the senate for the future  This threat did not want its effect at their next meeting where notwithstanding the steadfast opposition of Appius and the terrible blow that was about to be given to the fortunes of many of the members it was resolved to enter into a treaty with the people and to make them such offers as should induce them to return Ten commissioners were accordingly deputed at the head of whom were Largius and Valerius who had been dictators and Menenius Agrippa equally loved by the senate and the people The dignity and the popularity of these ambassadors procured them a very respectable reception among the soldiers and a long conference began between them Largius and Valerius employed all their oratory on the one hand while Sicinius and Lucius Junius who were the spokesmen of the soldiery aggravated their distresses with all that maleeloquence which is the child of nature The conference had now  continued for a long time when Menenius Agrippa who had been originally a plebeian himself a shrewd man and who consequently knew what kind of eloquence was most likely to please the people addressed them with that celebrated fable which is so finely told us by Livy  "In times of old when every part of the body could think for itself and each had a separate will of its own they all with common consent resolved to revolt against the belly they knew no reason they said why they should toil from morning till night in its service while the belly in the mean time lay at its ease in the midst of them all and indolently grew fat upon their labours accordingly one and all they agreed to befriend it no more The feet vowed they would carry it no longer the hands vowed they would feed it no longer and the teeth averred they would not chew a morsel of meat though it were placed between them Thus resolved they all for some time shewed their spirit and kept their word but soon they found that instead of mortifying the belly by these means they only undid themselves they languished for a while and perceived when too late that it was owing to the belly that they had strength to work or courage to mutiny"  This fable the application of which is obvious had an instantaneous effect upon the people They unanimously cried out that Agrippa  should lead them back to Rome and were making preparations to follow him when Junius Brutus beforementioned withheld them alledging that though they were gratefully to acknowledge the kind offers of the senate yet they had no safeguard for the future against their resentment that therefore it was necessary for the security of the people to have certain officers created annually from among themselves who should have power to give such of them as should be injured redress and plead the cause of the community  The people who are ever of opinion with the last speaker highly applauded this proposal which however the commissioners had not power to comply with they therefore sent to Rome to take the instructions of the senate who worried with divisions among themselves and harrassed by complaints from without were resolved to have peace at whatsoever price it should be obtained accordingly as if with one voice they consented to the creation of their new officers who were called  Tribunes of the People  Appius alone protesting with vehemence against the measure  The tribunes of the people were at first five in number though afterwards their body was encreased by five more They were always annually elected by the people and almost always from their body They had the power of annulling  all such decrees of the senate as they considered to lean upon the people and to shew their readiness to protect the meanest their doors stood open night and day to receive their complaints They at first had their seats placed before the doors of the senatehouse and being called in they were to examine every decree annulling it by the word  veto I forbid it  or confirming it by signing the letter  T  which gave it its validity Their persons were to be sacred and though they were mark'd out by none of the ensigns of office such as the curule chair or the lictors which attended upon other magistrates yet their power was greatly superior having a negative vote upon all decrees of the senate They were however to have no authority without the walls of the city and it was unlawful for them to be absent from it a day but what still most diminished their authority was that any one of their number could put a negative upon the measures of the rest and this was afterwards found the most artful method of opposing them for one gained over to the senate rendered the attempts of the rest abortive This new office therefore being thus instituted Sicinius Bellutus Lucius Junius Caius Licinius Albinus and Icilius Ruga were the first tribunes that were chosen by the suffrages of the people The senate also made an edict confirming the abolition of debts and  now all things being adjusted both on the one side and the other the people after having sacrificed to the Gods of the mountain returned back once more in triumph to Rome  CHAP XI From the creation of the tribunes to the appointment of the decemviri  WE have hitherto seen the people struggling against the exorbitant power of the senate but we now begin a period in which the senate are struggling against the encreasing power of the people a period in which the latter beginning to feel theit own force and being put into motion bear all down before them with irresistible violence The first advantage the tribunes obtained was a permission to chuse from among the people two annual officers as assistants in the fatigues of their duty These were caled aediles as a part of their business consisted in taking care of the public buildings aqueducts and sewers and likewise in determining some causes that had hitherto been determinable by the consuls only They were to remark those who held more land than the laws allowed them to curb all public immoralities and abolish nuisances to provide corn and oil in times of famine and  to prevent any monopolies that might be made by the purchasers of these commodities The people having obtained these privileges and all their clamours being appeased now marched against the Vosci and Antiates took Corioli one of their chief towns and soon after overthrew the enemy with great slaughter In this battle Martius after surnamed Coriolanus particularly distinguished himself  The people being thus rendered more turbulent by the condescension of the senate and by a triumph over the enemy had soon after fresh opportunity to shew their aptitude to clamour During the late separation all tillage had been entirely neglected and a famine was the consequence the ensuing season The senate did all that lay in their power to remedy the distress but the people pinched with want and willing to throw the blame on any but themselves ascribed the whole of their distress to the avarice of the patricians who having purchased up all the corn as was alledged intended to indemnify themselves for the abolition of debts by selling it out at great advantage but this was not all they were charged with The senate in order to lessen the number of citizens in this time of famine had sent many of them to Velitra a city of the Volscians that had lately been much depopulated by a plague This excited an universal clamour among the people which  the tribunes took care to encrease This they said was only an artful method of getting rid of such citizens as were obnoxious to the nobles it was little else than banishing the bravest men of the state without an offence and thus by weakening the strength of the people to encrease their own These reports being industriously propagated an assembly was called in which the consuls and the tribunes by turns harangued the people A contest managed with so much impetuosity on both sides every moment grew warmer the consuls insisted that the tribunes had no right to address the assembly the tribunes on the other hand asserted that their office was sacred and that they ought to suffer no interruption in their duty In this the people unanimously concurred for whatever their leaders thought fit to propose they were ready to ratify a law therefore was made that no man should dare to interrupt the tribunes while they spoke to the people a law which greatly encreased their power as now from taking the assembly's instructions they were authorized to direct them  The city after this enjoyed a transient calm some of the people retired to their houses to support famine with patience and resignation while others made incursions upon the enemy and returned with the spoil But abundance soon after renewed in them that turbulence  which the continuance of the famine had appeased but not removed A large fleet of ships laden with corn from Sicily a great part of which was a present from Gelon the king of that country to the Romans and the rest purchased by the senate with the public money raised their spirits once more and enflamed their eagerness for dissension When it came to be debated in the senate in what manner this large supply should be distributed violent divisions arose Some were for letting the poorer sort have a sufficient quantity for nothing others were for selling it at a low price and thus reimburse the treasury but when it came to the turn of Coriolanus to speak he insisted that no part of it should be distributed until the late invasions which the people had made upon the rights of the senate should be restored and until the commonwealth was reduced to its former regularity  "Why cried he do we bear to see the state divided between two powers whose dissensions only serve to harrass it the more Can we tamely bear to see tribunes give laws in Rome and rule with uncontroled power when we could not stoop to kings If the factious and turbulent are unwilling to live at Rome let them retire once more to their mountain it is better not to govern if we must share our command with the dregs of the people"  A speech so inflammatory and  a measure so violent rekindled all the flames of dissension The multitude in the violence of their resentment would have fallen upon the senate itself but the tribunes restrained their fury and only pointed it upon Coriolanus whom they devoted to destruction Coriolanus however still remained unshaken nature had made him bold frugal and inflexible and to these he added the acquired virtues of great respect for the laws great knowledge of war and an immoderate regard for his country or rather that part of it whose quarrel he espoused He accordingly treated the summons of the tribunes to appear before them with contempt They therefore next sent their aediles to apprehend and bring him before the people but a party of the young patricians gathered round their favourite repulsed the aediles and having beaten drove them away This was a signal for universal uproar the tumult encreased from every quarter and a civil war threatened to ensue had not the consuls promised the people the most ample redress The tribunes insisted that he should be thrown headlong from the Tarpeian Rock as a rebel and a contemner of the sacred authority of the Roman people and and condemned him even without demanding the suffrages of the people They were going once more to lay hold on his person but the patricians again rescued him A conduct so resolute  on one side and so assuming on the other in some measure put the populace in suspense they were afraid to assist the tribunes against those who had been their generals and captains and gazed upon the contest with trembling irresolution Their backwardness therefore to lend assistance began to raise suspicions in the tribunes that they had proceeded with too much violence they in consequence demanded to bring his trial before the assembly of the people and that his case should be argued before that authority from which there lay no appeal The patricians who though conscious of the innocence of Coriolanus were yet willing to give peace to the city consented and a day was appointed for making his defence Coriolanus demanded of the tribunes what they intended to charge him with to which they replied that they intended to accuse him of aiming at sovereignty and tyranny whereupon he chearfully put himself upon trial conscious of his innocence of the charge  When the appointed day was come all persons were filled with the greatest expectation and a vast concourse from the adjacent country assembled and filled up the Forum The tribunes in the mean time divided the people by tribes separating them with cords from each other and ordering that they should give their votes separately and not by centuries as  since the time of Hostilius had always been the custom This as we have remarked before was depriving the patricians of all their influence since the numbers of the populace were sure to prevail however the senate unwilling to make the cause of Coriolanus their own at last consented to this stretch of power in the plebeian But to make a shew of defending him to the last one of the consuls mounted the rostrum in his favour declaring what actions of service he had done the state how little a few words escaping in the heat of passion ought to be attended to he signified that the whole senate were petitioners in his cause and desired the tribunes that they would keep wholly to their threatened impeachment namely his aiming at the sovereign power To this Sicinus the tribune replied that he would urge against the guilty all things of every kind that could tend to prove him guilty that the state had too much to fear from his influence and his number of clients not to use every means of bringing him to justice That he owed much more to the safety of the state than to any vain complaisance to the senate and that the very attempt to depress the power of the people who had all the rights of humanity to govern themselves was a crime Coriolanus upon this presented himself before the people with a degree of intrepidity that merited better fortune His  graceful person his persuasive eloquence the cries of those whom he had saved from the enemy enclined the auditors to relent he began by recounting all the battles he had fought and the various posts he had sustained he shewed the various crowns which had been given him by his generals as rewards of merit and exposed to view the numberless wounds he had received in acquiring them he related all the breaches he had entered and all the lives he had saved calling out to such as were present to bear witness to the truth of his recital These with the most moving protestations entreated their fellows to spare that life by which they lived and if there must be an offering for public resentment they themselves were ready to die for him A defence like this supported with all that boldness which conscious innocence inspires moved every hearer to think of pardon many cried out that so brave a man deserved a triumph not death and that his very trial was a national reproach The giddy multitude were going therefore to absolve him when Decius one of the tribunes a man of fluent eloquence rose up to reply  "However cried he we may be prevented by the senate from urging those speeches which were made amongst that august body tending to destroy the privileges of the people yet still we are not uprovided we decline aggravating what  he has said we have facts which we call upon the accused to clear himself of We have an ancient law amongst us that all plunder taken from the enemy shall be appropriated to the use of the publick and be given into the treasury untouched by the general But a law so equitable in itself and so inviolably observed by our ancestors has been infringed by this man who stands accused before you In a late incursion into the territories of Antium though his plunder both in slaves cattle and provisions was very great yet the publick were neither the better nor the richer for it it was divided only among his friends and followers men whom probably he only intended to enrich to be the better able to secure our ruin It has ever been the practice of tyrants to begin the work of ambition by forming a numerous body of partizans who are willing to lose public regard in private emolument Here then we ground our charge let him if he can deny the fact and let him bring proofs not by vainly shewing his scars but by convincing us of his innocence"  This charge was entirely unexpected Coriolanus had in fact when the people refused to list issued out at the head of his clients and plundered the enemy who had the insolence of making incursions to the very  walls of Rome These spoils which were so justly earned he never thought of bringing into the treasury as they were the acquisition of a private adventure Being therefore unable to answer what was alledged against him to the satisfaction of the people and utterly confounded with the charge the tribunes immediately took the votes and Coriolanus was condemned to perpetual exile  Never did the populace testify a sincerer joy even in triumphing over a vanquished enemy than they did on this occasion having in a manner totally controlled the power of the senate since henceforward they assumed a right of summoning any of the individuals of that body before them whom they thought proper to accuse The senate on the other hand saw themselves reduced to an abject dependance upon the multitude deprived of all security for their persons and all their former rights of being judged by each other This sentence against their bravest defender struck their whole body with sorrow consternation and regret Coriolanus alone in the midst of this tumult seemed an unconcerned spectator He returned home followed by the lamentations of hundreds of the most respectable senators and citizens of Rome in order to take a lasting leave of his wife his children and his mother Veturia While they in the first transports of sorrow  hung round him as loath to part he with a manly fortitude tore himself from their embraces he exhorted them to bear their fate with fortitude but to think of him no more Thus recommending his little children to their care and all to the care of heaven he left the city without followers or fortune to take refuge among the enemies of Rome Thus the plebeians who had obtained tribunes merely for their own defence employed those very magistrates to annoy others and by insensible degrees stript the patricians of all their former privileges  Coriolanus now obliged to wander sought less for a retreat from Rome than for an opportunity of vengeance All his fortitude and the early institutions of his mother were not able to repress the resentment of his wrongs or his desire of punishing his enemies even though it involved the ruin of his country Tullus Attius a man of great power among the Volsci and a violent enemy of the Romans seemed to him a fit instrument to assist his revenge Resolving to apply to him he enters Antium the city where Tullus commanded by night and going directly to his house seated himself near the hearth by the houshold gods a place which among the heathens was held sacred Tullus being informed that a stranger with an all of dignity far beyond what was common  had taken refuge in his house came and demanded his name and business  "My name cried the Roman is Caius Marcius my surname is Coriolanus the only reward that remains of all my services I am banished Rome for being a friend to it I am come to take refuge here where I have ever been a declared enemy If you are willing to make use of my services you shall find me grateful if you are willing to revenge the injuries I have done behold me in your power"  Tullus struck with his dignity and known courage instantly gave him the hand of friendship and espoused his quarrel The first thing therefore to be done was to induce the Volsci to break the league which had been made with Rome and for this purpose Tullus sent many of his citizens to Rome in order to see some games at that time celebrating but in the mean time gave the senate private information that the strangers had dangerous intentions of burning the city This had the desired effect the senate issued an order that all strangers whoever they were should depart from Rome before sunset This order Tullus represented to his countrymen as an infraction of the treaty and procured an embassy to Rome complaining of the breach and redemanding all the territories belonging to the Volscians of which they had been violently  possessed declaring war in case of a refusal This message was treated by the senate with contempt they bade the Ambassadors inform their countrymen that menaces were not the way to prevail with Rome that they would keep with their swords those possessions which their valour had won and should the Volscians be the first to take up arms the Romans would be the last to lay them down  War being thus declared on both sides Coriolanus and Tullus were made generals of the Volscians and accordingly invaded the Roman territories ravaging and laying waste all such lands as belonged to the plebeians but letting those of the senators remain untouched In the mean time the levies went on but slowly at Rome the two consuls who were re▪elected by the people seemed but little skilled in war and even  eared to encounter a general whom they knew to be their superior in the field The allies also shewed their fears and slowly brought in their succours so that Coriolanus continued to take their towns one after the other Circaeum a Roman colony first submitted to h  s arms he then attacked the Latins who vainly implored assistance from Rome The towns of Tolerium Lavici Pes and Bola were all taken by storm their goods plundered and the inhabitants made prisoners of war such as yield  d were treated mildly such as resisted  were put to the sword fortune followed him in every expedition and he was now so famous for his victories that the Volsci left their towns defenceless to follow him into the field being assured under his conduct of success The very soldiers of his colleague's army came over to him and would acknowledge no other general Thus finding himself unopposed in the field and at the head of a numerous army  e at length pitched his camp at the Cluilian ditch within five miles of Rome Nothing now was to be seen in the city that had lately been so turbulent but timidity and despair The people who from their walls beheld the enemy ravaging their fields begged peace with tears and supplications They now began to entreat the senate to recal the edict which had banished Coriolanus and acknowledged the injustice of their former proceedings The senate however despised such meanness resolving if possible not to betray the injustice of the state to foreign enemies or to grant those favours to a traitor which they had denied him when but accused of being so Yet what could their resolutions avail when they had not power to support them Coriolanus approached nearer every day and at last invested the city fully resolved to besiege it It was then that the fierce spirit of the patricians was entirely subdued both senate and people unanimously  agreed to send deputies to him with proposals of a restoration in case he should draw off his army Coriolanus received their proposals at the head of his principal officers and with the sternness of a general that was to give the law He with the utmost severity informed them that he was now general of the Volscians and had only their interest to consider that if they hoped for peace they must restore all the towns which originally belonged to that people and make them free of the city as the Latins were and that he would give them thirty days to consider of it The intermediate time he employed in taking several other towns from the Latins at the end of which he returned and again encamped his army before the walls of Rome  Another embassy was now sent forth conjuring him not to exact from his native city aught but what became Romans to grant Coriolanus however naturally inflexible and severe still persisted in his former demands and granted them but three days in which to finish their deliberations A message so peremptory filled the whole town with consternation Every one now ran to take arms some posted themselves upon the ramparts others watched the gates lest they should be secretly delivered by partizans which Coriolanus had within others fortified their houses as if the enemy were already  masters of the walls In this general confusion there was neither discipline nor command The consuls whose fears only were their advisers had been elected for very different merits than those of skill in war The tribunes lately so fierce were now no more heard of all shared the universal terror and it seemed as if the boasted courage of Rome had gone over with their general into the camp of the Volscians In this exigence all that seemed left them was another deputation still more solemn than either of the former composed of the pontiffs the priests and the augurs These cloathed in their habits of ceremony and with a grave and mournful deportment issued from the city and entered the camp of the conqueror they besought him by all that was sacred by the respect he owed the gods and that which he might have for those who being servants of the gods were now at his feet to give peace to his country but all in vain they found him severe and inflexible as before He testified that respect for them which the sanctity of their characters demanded but sent them away without relaxing in any of his demands  When the people saw them return ineffectually they began to give up the commonwealth as lost Their temples were filled with old men with women and children who prostrate at their altars put up their ardent prayers for  the preservation of their country Nothing was to be heard but anguish and lamentation nothing to be seen but scenes of affright and distress At length it was suggested to them that what could not be effected by the intercession of the senate or the adjuration of the priests might be brought about by the tears of his wife or the commands of his mother This deputation seemed to be relished by all and even the senate itself gave it the sanction of their authority Veturia the mother of Coriolanus at first made some hesitation to undertake so pious a work knowing the inflexible temper of her son and fearing only to shew his disobedience in a new point of light by rejecting the commands of a parent however she undertook the embassy and set forward from the city accompanied by many of the principal matrons of Rome with Volumnia his wife and his two children Coriolanus who at a distance discovered this mournful train of females was resolved to give them a denial and called his officers round him to be witnesses of his resolution but when told that his mother and his wife were among the number he instantly came down from his tribunal to meet and embrace them At first the womens tears and embraces took away the power of words and the rough soldier himself hard as he was could not refrain from sharing in their distress  "My son cried she how am I to consider this meeting do I embrace my son or my enemy am I your mother or your captive How have I lived to see this day to see my son a banished man and still more distressful the enemy of his country How has he been able to turn his arms against the place which gave him life how direct his rage against those walls which protect his wife his children and his gods But it is to me only that my country owes her oppressor had I never been a mother Rome had still been free the wretched consciousness of this will afflict me as long as life shall last and that cannot last me long But though I am prepared for death yet at least let these wretched sufferers claim some part of your compassion and think what will be their fate when to banishment they must add captivity"  Coriolanus during this speech seemed much agitated by contending passions his mother who saw him moved still seconded her words by the most persuasive eloquence her tears his wife and children hung round him entreating for protection and pity while the fair train her companions added their lamentations and deplored their own and their country's distress Coriolanus for a moment was silent feeling the strong conflict between honour and inclination at length as if rouzed  from his dream he flew to take up his mother who had fallen at his feet crying out  "O my mother thou hast saved Rome but lost thy son"  He accordingly gave orders to draw off the army pretending to the officers that the city was too strong to be taken Tullus who had long envyed his glory was not remiss in aggravating the lenity of his conduct to his countrymen Upon their return Coriolanus was slain in an insurrection of the people and afterwards honourably buried with late and ineffectual repentance  Great and many were the public rejoicings at Rome upon the retreat of the Volscian army The senate decreed to grant the women what honours they should demand but they only asked to have a temple dedicated to Female Fortune built in the place where they had delivered their country which was accordingly erected at the public charge In the mean time that courage which had been for a time overpowered began again to shew itself in the field Coriolanus being no more they ventured to face their Volscian enemies who indeed contributed by their own contentions together with that of their allies to render any foreign force in a manner unnecessary to their overthrow A signal victory was obtained over them and the Hernici the year ensuing Among others Tullus their general was slain  Spurius Cassius Viscellinus had the principal honour in obtaining this victory He was a man naturally vain and filled with ostentation ambitious to an extreme and as ready to overrate his own services as to undervalue those of another He had been three times consul and had been decreed two triumphs by the senate these advantages added to some popularity raised his pride to aspire at being king of Rome In order to prepare for this being impowered by the senate to give the conquered nations what conditions of peace he should think proper he resolved to attach them to his interests by the most flattering concessions He therefore gave them back a third of what he had conquered he granted them the title of citizens of Rome and treated the vanquished in all respects as he would have done a victorious army To make friends in every part of the state he gave the Latins one moiety of the conquer'd lands remaining and reserved the other part for the poor citizens of Rome Not content with this he was resolved to encrease his popularity by distributing among the poor some lands which had long been in the possession of the rich and which he asserted to be the property of the publick Accordingly on the day succeeding that of his triumph giving an account according to custom of what he had done he expatiated upon his extraordinary  care and wise management of the commonwealth on his having encreased the subjects and citizens of Rome and on his own peculiar endowments for guiding the state he went on to observe that hower extensive the conquests of Rome might be it signified but little if the rich only enjoyed the advantages of them if that while the senate and patricians lived in affluence the veteran soldier pined in want and obscurity He therefore was of opinion that an exact estimate should be made of all the lands taken from the enemy which were now in possession of the rich and that they should be equally divided among the lower citizens This was the original of the famous Agrarian law which afterwards caused such disturbances among the people Nothing could exceed the indignation of the senate upon hearing it proposed as they had before been almost stript of their public rights they saw this attacked them in their private possessions all that fortune which their ancestors or themselves had acquired by valour or industry was now destined to be plundered from them to be distributed among the indolent the extravagant and the base One deliberation succeeded upon another to concert measures how to frustrate the effects of this law and the ambition of Cassius The people were not less mutinous on their part the tribunes and those whose  fortunes were above the lowest rank were unwilling to be reduced to a level with the meanest of those they pretended to direct the clients of the rich were attached to the interest of their patrons but notwithstanding this the majority of the multitude with Cassius at their head strenuously clamoured for the Agrarian law and threatened destruction to the empire in case of refusal Even several of the Hernici and Volsci were called in on this occasion to encrease the tumult or to bring off the proposer in case of failure At last the senate perceived the necessity of complying and therefore gave the populace a promise that the lands should be divided among them according to their de  ire but that the allies and associates who had no part in acquiring those lands should have no share in the division This promise at present appeased the people and gave the senate an opportunity of concerting measures for punishing the original proposer Accordingly some time after the questors by their order appointed a day for Cassius to answer to the charge of his designing to become king before the assembly of the people A blow so unexpected alarmed this demagogue with the most just apprehensions particularly as he had the tribunes as well as the patricians against him He appeared before the assembly habited in a manner becoming his situation  and attempted to interest the people in his favour He alledged that he was persecuted in this manner by the patricians for his zeal in their cause that he was their only surviving friend and that their interests were combined with his But he found himself deserted by all The senate had the justest reason to pursue him the tribunes envying him his share of popularity neglected to espouse his cause and the multitude pleased with the patricians for their late compliance with their demands gave him up to their fury who was the promoter of them Being therefore found guilty of a number of crimes all tending toward altering the constitution notwithstanding his many real services and the intercession of his friends and clients in mourning he was thrown headlong from the Tarpeian rock by those very people whose interests he had endeavoured to extend It was too late that they perceived their error and began to regret their champion with a degree of sorrow that but argued their ingratitude  Soon after the death of Cassius the people became again urgent for the execution of the Agrarian law but the senate by a subterfuge unworthy their wisdom caused the consuls to prepare for an expedition against the Aequi The people however at first refused to enlist till the consuls hitting upon a new expedient ordered all the country houses of the recusants to be levelled  with the ground This had the desired effect numbers came to offer themselves to save their possessions from destruction and were led against the enemy with the usual good fortune of Rome Thus while the contests continued in the city the Roman arms made continual progress in Italy for that spirit of liberty which animated both parties only contributed to enflame their courage  These dilatory arts continued for near five years on the part of the senate and as obstinate a spirit of clamour on that of the people the one having their private interests as well as those of the publick to engage them the other having a promise given and a consciousness of their own superior power to encrease their obstinacy In the midst of these troubles the Romans received a signal defeat under the conduct of Virginius one of their consuls from the Hetrurian army and though Fabius came very opportunely to his relief yet upon his retreat the enemy made incursions even to the walls of Rome This served to encrease the discontents and the animosities of the citizens the senators still witholding their promise and the people refusing to enlist In such an extremity the family of the Fabii to the number of four thousand men offered to defend the frontiers of the Roman territories They built a castle nigh the borders of the enemy and making frequent  incursions greatly enriched themselves by the spoil It will not comport with the brevity of this work to relate all the minute transactions and battles without consequence which attended these wars between Rome and these little states round her It will suffice to say that they all ended with the same good fortune namely the enemies begging peace and the extension of the territories of Rome The Fabii however were less successful being all cut off to a man by an ambuscade which was laid for them by the people of Veii Of this noble family one only survived whose posterity became afterwards equally serviceable to the state  But not the territories alone of Rome were encreased during these times of war and civil  commotion her citizens also became more numerous In the enumeration of this year they were found to amount to one hundred and eleven thousand men fit to bear arms with treble that number of women children and slaves This encrease of people without commerce only tended to advance the disturbances of the city Every year produced some new tumult between the contending orders of the state The people now become the electors of the magistrates had not skill or integrity to fix upon capable men and scarce did any consul lay down his office but the multitude were foremost  to accuse his remisness or incapacity It was in this manner that they accused Menenius their consul for suffering the family of the Fabii to be cut off he was indeed an unskilful general but he was at the same time innocent of the charge laid against him This however did not avail he was fined about twenty crowns a sum which though moderate in modern estimation he was unable to pay he therefore in detestation of the injustice and ingratitude of his fellow citizens shut himself up in his own house and starved himself to death  The year following the two consuls of the former year Manlius and Fabius were in the same manner cited by the tribunes to appear before the people The Agrarian law was the object invariably pursued and they were accused of having made unjustifiable delays in putting it off The same perseverance on one side and obstinacy on the other again set the city in a ferment and threatened destruction to one of the parties when Genutius the Tribune who had revived the law was found dead in his bed though without any marks of violence A circumstance like this which should have awakened the suspicions of the people only served to allarm their superstitions they began to think the gods were against their cause and showed symptoms of returning to their former obedience The consuls in order to avail themselves  of this lucky occasion began to make fresh levies for it was now become the settled policy of the times to draw off the peccant humours of the people by leading them to war wherefore mounting their tribunals and being attended by their lictors they continued to enrol the citizens with success till coming to one Volero a centurion who refused to be enlisted as a private centinel they ordered him to be stripped and scourged This injudicious severity not only rekindled the people's resentment but afterwards produced a new cause of contention concerning the power of the consuls and the privileges of the people The prisoner was rescued by the multitude the magistrates driven off and still to compleat their mortification soon after Volero was made one of the tribunes of the people  The election of this demagogue seemed very injurious to the patrician party he was not only resolved upon carrying the Agrarian law but also upon enacting another in which the people should give their votes by tribes and not by their curiae or their centuries This was another mortal blow to the patrician power for as when the people voted by centuries the patricians were entire masters of the contest and when by curiae in which only the inhabitants of the city voted they also from their number of clients had the majority of voices  so now when by this law all freemen of Rome from whatever part of its territories they came should be admitted to give a single vote equal to that of the first senator all influence was entirely lost and the patricians had nothing to do but to remain passive It was therefore at first strongly opposed by the senate and as warmly urged by the people In this contest  Appius Claudius the consul son to the former Appius by a sort of hereditary hatred to the people was among the foremost In one of their public assemblies he opposed their designs so warmly and so justly exposed the turbulent tempers of the tribunes that they ordered him to depart the assembly and upon his refusal to be sent to prison  A stretch of power so great astonished all the senators who were present they offered to take arms in his defence and as the people had in the former case beaten off the lictors so they were in this driven off by the patricians This seemed the signal for a new tumult stones torches and every weapon that fury could furnish in a place where the citizens never carried arms were employed against each other But Quintius the other consul of a mild and peaceable disposition throwing himself into the midst of the combatants entreating and beseeching some and menacing others for that night assuaged their mutual  animosity Their tumults however were renewed the day following with more than former fury Appius with all his native fierceness charging at the head of his clients and other young patricians But Lectorius the tribune with an immense multitude of the lower part of the people took possession of the Capitol where they fortified themselves seemingly determined to hold it out against their opposers Their conduct now seemed still more resolute than in the former defection of the army to mount Aventine for as in that the insurgents were at a distance from Rome in this they were in the very heart of the city The appeasing of this tumult was reserved for Quintius also who obtained by his gentle remonstrances to have the law referred to the senate which after many debates which form rather than uncertainty might have dictated resolved that the tribunes and the people were to be gratified and that the law was to be enacted without delay It was past by the consent of all the orders and the officers of the people were elected from henceforward by the tribes Thus the people by degrees left the patricians nothing but the shadow of power of even which the multitude now taught the art of uniting were resolved to deprive them  In the mean time Appius as from the former part of his conduct we may well suppose  was far from being disposed to concur in this new concession of power he that bore the people a contempt that rather seemed effect of habit than of reason and inveighed against the senate's pusilanimity Nor were the people ignorant of this but desired an occasion of shewing their resentment for which an opportunity soon offered upon his being appointed general against the Volscians These as usual had made inroads upon the unguarded frontiers of Rome and Appius being now the commander of the army the natural severity of his temper had a field to display itself in The Roman discipline which at the mildest was extremely rigorous he by his strictness rendered almost insupportable The soldiers but slowly obeyed a general they hated and he in return encreased his rigours upon the slowness of their obedience They now therefore considered his severity rather as a malicious vengeance than an wholesome chastisement and only awaited the enemy to retaliate not upon his person but his glory Accordingly the enemy appeared and the Romans fled He led them into the camp in order to harrangue them and they universally refused to give him an audience He then endeavoured to draw them off from the enemy but the whole body fled instead of making a regular retreat At length he found means of securing that part of his forces which yet remained  by encamping them in a place of safety where marshaling them in their ranks and reviling them for their cowardice he gave posterity a great example of the severity of Roman discipline and the greatness of military obedience He first ordered all the centurions who had fled or quitted their ranks to be scourged and then beheaded and then asking his soldiers where were their arms he chose out every tenth man by lot and him he executed in the presence of his trembling companions Soldiers with so much ardour for liberty in times of peace and such profound submission to their generals in war were fitted to make the conquest of the world Appius however did not long continue unmolested in his severity for some time after the tribunes pushed on the Agrarian law with vigour and he persisting in his opposition they appointed him a day to answer to an accusation against him of being the declared enemy of public liberty Appius obeyed but appeared before the people not in the usual manner in a supplicating dress or posture but spoke for himself with a confidence that a previous settled resolution to die had inspired The tribunes finding that his innocence was too apparent to be impeached put off his trial to another day which he prevented by suicide a practice that was now becoming common in Rome  The death of Appius and some wars or rather incursions made by the Romans into the territories of the Volsci suspended for a time the peoples earnestness after the Agrarian law  but soon after the tribunes began new commotions and had the boldness to assert that the people ought not only to have a share in the lands but also in the government of the commonwealth and that a code of written laws should be compiled to mark out the bounds of their duty The opposition to this was not les  violent on the side of the patricians who drove the clamorous multitude from the Forum headed by Caeso the son of that Quintius Cincinnatus whom we shall hereafter find so famous for his courage and his frugality The tribunes resolved to make an example of this young patrician to deter the future outrages of others and therefore appointed him a day to answer for his life before the people His being the son of a man entirely respected by both parties was treated with such lenity that he was admitted to bail but flying to Etruria his father was obliged to sell almost his whole estate to reimburse the sureties and then retreating to a small farm and a little cottage beyond the Tyber lived a contented life tilling his few acres with his own hands and reaping the produce of his industry The tribunes however were not satisfied with the expulsion  of Caeso they still continued to clamour for the Agrarian law and even raised a report that the senators had formed a plot against their lives This contrivance was principally intended to fright the senate into a compliance but it had only the more obvious effect of encreasing the tumults of the people and aggravating their animosity  In this state of commotion and universal disorder Rome was upon the point of falling into the power of a foreign enemy Herdonius a Sabine a man of great intrepidity and ambition formed the design of seizing and plundering the city while it was employed in intestine distractions For this purpose having got together an army of about four thousand men composed of his clients and fugitive slaves he sent them down the river Tyber on floats by night so that the people were astonished the next morning to behold a foreign enemy in possession of the Capitol the citadel of Rome Herdonius on his part did all that was in his power to persuade the lower citizens and slaves to join his party to the one he promised freedom to the other an ample participation of benefits and spoil The tribunes in this exigence were far from exciting the people to arms they on the contrary used all their eloquence to persuade them from fighting until the patricians should engage by oath to create  ten men with a power of making laws and to suffer the people to have an equal share in all the benefits that should accrue These conditions though very severe the necessity of the times obliged the consuls to promise and Valerius who was one of them putting himself at the head of such as offered marched towards the capitol crying out as he passed  "Whoever wishes to save his country let him come and follow me"  A large body of people followed him to the attack and the capitol was at length retaken by storm but the consul was killed in the assault Herdonius slew himself the slaves died by the executioner and the rest were made prisoners of war  But although the city was thus delivered from a foreign invasion it was by no means set free from its intestine divisions The tribunes now pressed the surviving consul for the performance of his promise but it seems the Agrarian law was a grant the senate could not think of giving up to the people The consul therefore made many delays and excuses till at length being driven to give a positive answer he told them that as the promise was made by the two consuls he could do nothing alone An assembly was therefore now appointed for chusing another consul and the senate in order to give the people no hopes of obtaining their wishes fixed upon Quintus Cincinnatus  whose son had so lately been obnoxious to them Cincinnatus had as has been already related for some time given up all the views of ambition and retired to his little farm where the deputies of the senate found him holding the plow and dressed in the mean attire of a labouring husbandman He apeared but little elevated with the addresses of ceremony and the pompous habits they brought him and upon declaring to him the senate's pleasure he testified rather a concern that his aid should be wanted he naturally preferred the charms of a country retirement to the fatiguing splendours of office and only said to his wife as they were leading him away  "I fear my Attillia that for this year our little fields must remain unsown"  Thus taking a tender leave he departed for the city where both parties were strongly enflamed against each other This new consul however was resolved to side with neither but by a strict attention to the interests of his country instead of gaining the confidence of faction to seize the esteem of all Thus by threats and welltimed submission he prevailed upon the tribunes to put off their law for a time and carried himself so as to be a terror to the multitude whenever they refused to enlist and their greatest encourager whenever their submission deserved it His policy consisted in holding the citizens who had  egained the Capitol as still engaged to follow  him by their oath and threatening to lead them into a winter encampment to which they were totally unaccustomed in case they disobeyed by which he so far intimidated the tribunes that they gave up their law upon condition of his foregoing the threatened encampment upon the whole he went through his office with such skill moderation humanity and justice that the people seemed to forget that they wanted new laws and the senate seemed to wish his continuance in the consulship Thus having restored that tranquility to the people which he so much loved himself he again gave up the splendours of ambition to enjoy it with a greater relish in his little farm  Cincinnatus was not long retired from his office when a fresh exigence of the state once more required his assistance the Aequ  and the Volsci who though still worsted still were for renewing the war made new inroads into the territories of Rome Minu  ius one of the consuls  who succeeded Cincinnatus was sent to oppose them but being naturally timid and rather more afraid of being conquered than desirous of victory his army was driven into a defile between two mountains from which except through the enemy there was no egress This however the Aequi had the precaution to fortify so that the Roman army was so hemmed in on every side that nothing remained but submission to the enemy famine or immediate  death Some knights who found means of getting away privately through the enemy's camp were the first that brought the account of this disaster to Rome Nothing could exceed the consternation of all ranks of people when informed of it the senate at first thought of the other consul but not having sufficient experience of his abilities they unanimously turned their eyes upon Cincinnatus and resolved to make him dictator Cincinnatus the only person on whom Rome could now place her whole dependence was found as before by the messengers of the senate labouring in his little field with chearful industry He was at first astonished by the ensigns of unbounded power with which the deputies came to invest him but still more at the approach of the principal of the senate who came out to meet him upon his approach A dignity so unlooked for however had no effect upon the simplicity or the integrity of his manners and being now possessed of absolute power and called upon to nominate his master of the horse he chose a poor man named Tarquitius one who like himself despised riches when they led to dishonour Tarquitius was born of a patrician family but though of consummate bravery never being able to raise money to purchase an horse he had hitherto fought only as a foot soldier willing to serve his country though in the humblest situation Thus the saving a great  nation was devolved upon an husbandman taken from the plough and an obscure centinel found among the dregs of the army Upon entering the city the dictator put on a serene look and entreated all those who were able to bear arms to repair before sunset to the Campus Martius the place were the levies were made with necessary arms and provisions for five days He put himself at the head of these and marching all night with great expedition he arrived before day within sight of the enemy Upon his approach he ordered his soldiers to raise a loud shout to apprize the consul's army of the relief that was at hand The Aequi were not a little amazed when they saw themselves between two enemies but still more when they perceived Cincinnatus making the strongest entrenchments beyond them to prevent their escape and enclosing them as they had enclosed the consul To prevent this a furious combat ensued but the Aequi being attacked on both sides and unable to resist or fly begged a cessation of arms They offered the dictator his own terms he gave them their lives but obliged them in token of servitude to pass under the yoke which was two spears set upright and another across in the form of a door beneath which the vanquished were to march Their captains and generals he made prisoners of war being reserved to adorn his triumph As for the plunder of the enemies  camp that he gave entirely up to his own s  ldiers without reserving any part to himself or permitting those of the delivered army to have a snare Thus having rescued a Roman army from inevitable destruction having defeated a powerful enemy having taken and fortified their city and still more having refused any part of the spoil he resigned his dictatorship▪ after having enjoyed it but fourteen days The senate would have enriched him but he declined their proffers chusing to retire once more to his farm and his cottage content with temperance and fame  The year following the Aequi resolving to retrieve their lost reputation again marched into the field and retook their city wherefore when levies were to be made in Rome to oppose their progress the tribunes refused to let the people be enrolled The necessity of the times however was such that an army was to be raised and the senators finding the reluctance of the multitude offered to go themselves with their clients and dependants So many old and reverend men who had long been considered as the fathers of the state marching feebly out to meet an enemy whom the young and the vigorous refused to encounter moved the multitude to such a degree that in spite of their demagogues they offered to go only demanding as a recompence to have the number of  their tribunes encreased from five to ten This some of the senate considered as an expedient to multiply the number of their enemies but Cincinnatus who judged more maturely upon the subject assured them it would be the most infallible means of debilitating that power which had so long controlled them That in case ten were elected in such a number there were the most just expectations to bring over a part and that a single tribune could reverse the resolutions of all the rest accordingly the senate readily came into his opinion and pretending to make their compliance a favour informed the tribunes that they had after much deliberation thought proper to grant their request  This grant seemed for a while to satisfy the people but in less than a year the new tribunes the first time uniting all together made still farther encroachments and ventured even by their own authority to order an assembling of the senate They required also that mount Aventine which being a mile and a half in compass and as yet untenanted might be granted to the people to build on With this though not till after the most violent contests the senate agreed in hopes that it might be a means of suppressing the seditions which they dreaded from refusing the Agrarian law Nevertheless in this they were disappointed for soon  after their tribunes renewed their former complaints  and insolence and the contests were carried on with such little restraint that blows and not arguments generally terminated every deliberation To such a pitch of audaciousness were they arrived that those demagogues set a day even for the consuls themselves to answer before the people They thought proper however upon maturer consideration to let drop this insolent prosecution but at the same time resolved not to discontinue their unremitting endeavours for the Agrarian law A day accordingly was fixed in which this important subject was to be discussed and numbers of all ranks were present either to give their votes or their opinions The tribunes spoke largely on the justice of such a law several of the people related what services they had done and what trifling rewards they had obtained the audience were prepossessed in favour of the law but still more when Siccius Dentatus a plebeian advanced in years but of an admirable person and military deportment came forward to enumerate his hardships and his merits This old soldier made no scruple of extolling the various atchievements of his youth but indeed his merits deserved his ostentation He had served his country in the wars forty years he had been an officer thirty first a centurion then a tribune he had fought one hundred and twenty battles in which by the force of his single arm  he had saved a multitude of lives he had gained fourteen civic three mural and eight golden crowns besides eightythree chains sixty bracelets eighteen gilt spears and twentythree horsetrappings whereof nine were for killing his enemy in single combat moreover he had received fortyfive wounds all before and none behind particularly twelve on the day the Capitol was recovered from the enemy These were his honours yet notwithstanding all this he had never received any share of those lands which were won from the enemy but continued to draw on a life of poverty and contempt while others were possest of those very territories which his valour had won without any merit to deserve them or ever having contributed to the conquest A case of so much hardship had a strong effect upon the multitude they unanimously demanded that the law might be passed and that such merit should not go unrewarded It was in vain that some of the senators rose up to speak against it their voices were drowned by the cries of the people When reason therefore could no longer be heard passion as usual succeeded and the young patricians running furiously into the throng broke the balloting urns and dispersed the multitude that offered to oppose them For this they were some time after fined by the tribunes but their resolution nevertheless  for the present put off the Agrarian law  It generally happened in Rome that internal commotions were quieted by foreign invasions and the approach of the Aequi within sixteen miles of the city in some measure restored peace to the republick In this war Siccius Dentatus the veteran who had harangued the people gained greater honours than the consul who obtained the victory for being ordered upon a forlorn hope to attack the enemy in a quarter where he knew they were inaccessible he at first remonstrated the danger and desperation of the attempt but being reproached by the consul with cowardice he led on his body of eight hundred veterans to the place resolved to give by his death a pattern of obedience as he had in his life an example of resolution Fortune however was kinder to him than his expectations for perceiving a passage into the enemies camp which had not been pointed out by the consul he led his veterans onward and while the whole army amused the enemies on one side he attacked their camp on the other so that the Romans obtained a complete victory Dentatus however being conscious that he was sent upon this dangerous service only to procure him death or infamy had interest enough upon his return to prevent the consul's having a triumph as also to get himself created a tribune  likewise to get a law passed for punishing such magistrates as should for the future violate their authority and for having both consuls fined for their behaviour to him in particular Thus the fortune as well as the perseverance of the tribunes served to diminish the patrician power every year All their honours were now fading fast away their very possessions those fruits of long labour remained feebly in suspense and the next popular breeze threatened to shake them down  CHAP XII From the creation of the Decemviri to the extinction of that office  THE Commonwealth of Rome had now  for near sixty years been fluctuating between the contending orders that composed it till at length each side as if weary were willing to respire a while from the mutual exertions of their claims The Agrarian law seemed now but little attended to and all the animosity which it had produced appeared subsided But it has ever been with mankind that they form new desires in proportion to the number of their possessions The citizens now therefore of every rank began to complain of the arbitrary decisions  of their magistrates and wished to be guided by a written body of laws which when known might prevent wrongs as well as punish them In this both the senate and the people concurred as hoping that such laws would put an end to the commotions that so long had harrassed the state It was thereupon agreed that ambassadors should be sent to the Greek cities in Italy and to Athens to bring home such laws from thence as by experience had been found most equitable and useful For this purpose three senators Posthumius Sulpicius and Manlius were fixed upon and gallies assigned to convoy them agreeable to the majesty of the Roman people While they were upon this commission abroad a dreadful plague depopulated the city at home and supplied the interval of their absence with other anxiety than that of wishes for their return In about a year however the plague ceased and the ambassadors returned bringing home a body of laws collected from the most civilized states of Greece and Italy which being afterwards formed into ten tables and two more being added made that celebrated code called the laws of the twelve tables many fragments of which remain to this day  The ambassadors were no sooner returned than the tribunes required that a body of men should be chosen to digest their new laws into  proper form and to give weight to the execution of them After long debates whether this choice should not be partly made from the people as well as the patricians it was at last agreed that ten of the principal senators should be elected whose power continuing for a year should be equal to that of kings and consuls and that without any appeal That all other magistrates should lay down their offices until the laws should direct proper substitutes and that the new legislators should in the mean time exercise their authority with all the ensigns of their discontinued power The persons chosen were Appius and Genutius who had been elected consuls for the ensuing year Posthumius Sulpicius and Manlius the three ambassadors Sextius and Romulus former consuls with Julius Veturius and Horatius senators of the first consideration Thus the whole constitution of the state at once took a new form and a dreadful experiment was going to be tried of governing one nation by laws formed from the manners and customs of another  The Decemviri being now invested with absolute power agreed to take the reigns of government by turns and that each should dispense justice for a day They agreed also to avoid envy that he alone who was in the actual exercise of power should be attended with the ensigns of it and that the rest should be  only preceded by a petty officer called Accensus to distinguish them from the vulgar  The novelty of this form of government seemed extremely pleasing to the people at first nor was the moderation of the decemviri themselves less praiseworthy Appius in particular bore away the greatest share of popularity his affable air his republican professions and his moderation made them even forget his ancestors or that they once trembled at the name These magistrates for the first year wrought with extreme application they had not only to compile from a great variety of Greek laws but they were obliged also to get them interpreted by one Hermodorus an Ephesian as they themselves were ignorant of the language a strong instance how little as yet the Romans were advanced in the arts of politeness At length however by the help of their interpreter they formed a body of laws from those brought from Greece and from the ordinances of their own kings the whole comprized in ten tables These were agreed to by the whole people engraven on plates of brass and hung up in public view in the most conspicuous part of the Forum  Their work being thus finished it was expected that the Decemviri would be contented to retire but having known the charms of power they were now unwilling to resign it they  therefore pretended that some laws were yet wanting to compleat their design and entreated the senate for a continuance of their office To this they assented The choice of persons was next the object of public consideration Appius burning with a secret thirst of power feigned himself quite disgusted with the fatigues of the office and wished only for an able successor However underhand he contrived to put all those popular arts in practice which he knew would upon his standing a candidate secure his election Accordingly when the day came his colleagues were surprized to see him the first upon the list of these who stood for the office and still more when they found him elected by a great majority of the giddy people who mistook his ambition for popularity His friends also were elected through his influence Fabius Cornelius Servilius Minucius Antonius and Rabulius who were patricians together with Petillius Oppius and Duellius plebeians formed the second decemvirate These three last were chosen from among the people by the interest of Appius who to ingratiate himself with the multitude observed that it was very proper the people should have a share in forming those laws by which the people were to to be governed  Appius being thus reinstated in his high office now turned all his thoughts towards making it formidable and perpetual he therefore convened his colleagues and knowing them to be all his creatures he opened to them his design of retaining the power of which they had been put into po  ssion As they had been previously instructed they readily came into his proposal and bound themselves by the most solemn vows never to dissent among themselves never to give up their authority and not to make use of the opinions either of the senate or the people but in cases of downright necessity Now therefore the decemvirate put on a very different appearance from the former year instead only of one of them being attended by his rods and axes each made his appearance with those ensigns of terror and authority Instead of magistrates mild just and affable the people now beheld them converted into monsters of rapine licentiousness and cruelty They only made use of the forms of justice to put many of the citizens to death and deprive others of their estates and country Accusers and informers were suborned from among their dependants ready to give evidence as they were commanded while those who expected redress in any suit of justice had no prospect of success but to enter into a criminal confederacy with their judges Thus an universal corruption began to spread  itself over the people while the good and the wise either banished themselves from Rome or inwardly repined at its distress  But as such power could not long continue without some of the usual arts of deception which tyranny must sometimes stoops to in order to shew the people that they  ere not unmindful of their duty they added two tables more of laws to those already promulgated which together formed as we have already said that body of laws that goes by the name of the twelve tables In these last there was a law prohibiting all marriages between the patricians and plebeians by which they hoped to widen the breach between these two orders and thus avail themselves of their mutual animosity Their designs however were easily seen through but the people bore them with patience for the time of the expiration of their office was now at hand in which it was expected they would lay down their misused authority But they soon threw off the mask and regardless either of the approbation of the senate or the people continued themselves against all order another year in the decemvirate A conduct so notorious produced new discontents and these were as sure to produce fresh acts of tyranny The city was become almost a desert with respect to all who had any thing to lose and the decemvirs rapacity was then only discontinued when  they wanted fresh objects to exercise it upon In this state of slavery proscription and mutual distrust not one citizen was found to strike for his country's freedom these tyrants continued to rule without control being constantly guarded not with their lictors alone but a numerous crowd of dependants clients and even patricians whom their vices had confederated round them  In this gloomy situation of the state the Aequi and Volsci those constant enemies of the Romans undertook their incursions resolved to profit by the intestine divisions of the people and advanced within about ten miles of Rome This was an unexpected stroke to the decemviri who had no authority to raise an army themselves and therefore went reluctantly to ask aid from the senate whose deliberations had now been long suspended In this pressing juncture the senate was at last called together where Appius in a premeditated oration propounded the business for which they were convened He then desired that each should speak his sentiments as he named them but Valerius the grandson of Poplicola rising out of his turn was ordered by the tyrant to sit down Valerius however would not desist but violently inveighed against the tyranny of the decemvirate and their effrontery in expecting that the senate whose power they had destroyed  should now take measures to support their betrayers His speech was seconded by Marcus Horatius who with still greater freedom exposed their horrid invasion of the rights of their country their outrages their rapines and their cruelty Appius at first seemed to bear this harrangue with patience but at last his passions long used to indulgence could no longer keep within restraint he flew out into violence and threatened to have Horatius thrown headlong from the Tarpeian rock All the senators exclaimed against this infringement of the liberty of free debate as the highest breach of their privileges and an intolerable act of power Whereat the decemvir a little repenting his rashness began to excuse himself saying that he was willing to give liberty to all deliberations upon the question but could not bear an oration which leaving the point in debate only seemed calculated to promote sedition That he and his colleagues had received an unlimited power from the people till the great work of forming the laws was finished during which they were resolved to act to the extent of their power and then would be answerable for their administration This was a sufficient display of their intentions all the uninfluenced part of the senate particularly Claudius the uncle of Appius spoke with detestation of their proceedings but a large party in  the house whom the decemviri had previovsly formed and still others whom their fears had biassed shewed themselves enclined to agree with Appius in whatever he should propose He therefore demanded that he and his colleagues should have a power of levying and commanding the forces that were to go against the Aequi and immediately a decree of the senate passed confirming this proposal  The decemviri now in possession of all the military as well as of the civil power divided their army into three parts whereof one continued with Appius in the city to keep it under awe the other two were commanded by his colleagues and were led one against the Aequi and the other against the Sabines The Roman soldiers had not got into a method of punishing the generals whom they disliked by suffering themselves to be vanquished in the field They put it in practice upon this ocasion and shamefully abandoned their camp upon the approach of the enemy Never was the news of a victory more joyfully received at Rome than the tidings of this defeat the generals as is always the case were blamed for the treachery of their men some demanded that they should be deposed others cried out for a dictator to lead the troops to conquest but among the rest old Siccius Dentatus the tribune spoke his sentiments with his usual openness and treating the generals  with contempt shewed all the faults of their discipline in the camp and their conduct in the field Appius in the mean time was not remiss in observing the disposition of the people Dentatus in particular was marked out for vengeance and under pretence of doing him particular honour he was appointed legate and put at the head of the supplies which were sent from Rome The office of legate was held as sacred among the Romans as in it were united both the authority of a general with the reverence of the priesthood Dentatus no way suspecting his design went to the camp with alacrity where he was received with all the external marks of respect But the generals soon found means of indulging their desire of revenge He was appointed at the head of an hundred men to go and examine a more commodious place for encampment as he had very candidly assured the commanders that their present situation was wrong The soldiers however who were given as his attendants were assassins wretches who had long been ministers to the vengeance of the decemviri and who now engaged to murder him tho' with all that terror which his reputation as he was called the Roman Achilles might be supposed to inspire With these designs they led him from the way into the hollow bosom of a retired mountain where they began to set upon him from behind  Dentatus now too late perceived the treachery of the decemviri and was resolved to sell his his life as dearly as he could he therefore put his back to a rock and defended himself against those who pressed most closely Tho' now grown old he had still the remains of his former valour and killed no less than fifteen of the assailants and wounded thirty with his own hand The assassins now therefore terrified at his amazing bravery showered in their javelins upon him at a distance all which he received in his shield with undaunted resolution The combat though so unequal in numbers was managed for some time with doubtful success till at length his assailants bethought themselves of ascending the rock against which he stood and thus poured down stones upon him from above This succeeded the old soldier fell beneath their united efforts after having shewn by his death that it was to his fortitude and not his fortune he had come off so many times victorious The decemviri pretended to join in the general sorrow for so brave a man and decreed him a funeral with the first military honours but the greatness of their apparent distress compared with their known hatred only rendered them still more detestable to the people However a transaction still more atrocious than the former served to inspire the citizens with resolution to break all  measures of obedience and at last to restore freedom  Appius who still remained at Rome sitting one day on his tribunal to dispense justice saw a maiden of exquisite beauty and aged about fifteen passing to one of the public schools attended by a matron her nurse The charms of this damsel heightened by all the innocence of virgin modesty caught his attention and fired his heart The day following as she past he found her still more beautiful than before and his breast still more enflamed He now therefore resolved to obtain the gratification of his passion whatever should be the consequence and found means to inform himself of the virgin's name and family Her name was Virginia She was the daughter of Virginius a centurion then with the army in the field and had been contracted to Icilius formerly a tribune of the people who had agreed to marry her at the end of the present campaign Appius at first resolved to break this match and to espouse her himself but the laws of the twelve tables had forbidden the patricians to intermarry with the plebeians and he could not infringe these as he was the enactor of them Nothing therefore remained but a criminal enjoyment which as he was long used to the indulgence of all his passions he resolved on After having vainly tried to corrupt the  fidelity of her nurse he had recourse to another expedient still more guilty He pitched upon one Claudius who had long been the minister of his pleasures to assert that the beautiful maid was his slave and to refer the cause to his tribunal for decision Claudius behaved exactly according to his instructions for entering into the school where Virginia was playing among her female companions he seized upon her as his property and was going to drag her away by force but was prevented by the people drawn together by her cries At length however after the first heat of opposition was over he led the weeping virgin to the tribunal of Appius and there plausibly exposed his pretensions He asserted that she was born in his house of a female slave who sold her to the wife of Virginius who had been barren That he had several creditable evidences to prove the truth of what he said but that until they could come together it was but reasonable that the slave should be delivered into his custody being her proper master Appius seemed to be struck with the justice of his claims he observed that if the reputed father himself were present he might indeed be willing to delay the delivery of the maiden for some time but that it was not lawful for him in the present case to detain her from her lawful master He therefore adjudged her to Claudius as his slave  to be kept by him till Virginius should be able to prove his paternity This sentence was received with loud clamours and reproaches by the multitude the women in particular came round the innocent Virginia as if willing to protect her from her judge's fury while Icilius her lover boldly opposed the decree and obliged Claudius to take refuge under the tribunal of the decemvir All things now threatened an open insurrection when Appius fearing the event thought proper to suspend his judgment till the arrival of Virginius who was then about eleven miles from Rome with the army The day following however was fixed for the trial and in the mean time Appius sent letters to the generals to confine Virginius as his arrival in town might only serve to kindle sedition among the people These letters however were intercepted by the centurion's friends who sent him down a full relation of the design laid against the liberty and the honour of his only daughter Virginius upon this pretending the death of a near relation got permission to leave the camp and flew to Rome inspired with indignation and revenge Accordingly the next day he appeared before the tribunal to the astonishment of Appius leading his weeping daughter by the hand both habited in the deepest mourning Claudius the accuser was also  there and began by making his demand he said that it was well known that the children of slaves belonged to the masters of their parents and that Virginia was born in slavery He observed that pity might be an inducement to many to forego their claims but that he would sacrifice all lesser considerations to justice He then produced a female slave whom he had corrupted to swear that she had sold Virginia to the wife of her reputed father and he ended his pretensions by asserting that he could confirm her testimony by that of many others had it been needful Virginius next spoke in turn he represented that his wife had many children that she had been seen pregnant by numbers that if he had intentions of adopting a supposititious child he would have fixed upon a boy rather than a girl that it was notorious to all that his wife had herself suckled her own child and that it was surprizing such a claim should be now revived after a fifteen years discontinuance While the father spoke this with a stern air Virginia stood trembling by and with looks of persuasive innocence added weight to all his remonstrances The people seemed entirely satisfied of the hardship of his case till Appius fearing what he said might have dangerous effects upon the multitude interrupted him under a pretence of being sufficiently instructed  in the merits of the cause  "Yes says he my conscience obliges me to declare that I myself am a witness to the truth of the deposition of Claudius Most of this assembly know that I was left guardian to this youth and I was very early apprized that he had a right to this young woman but the affairs of the public and the dissentions of the people then prevented my doing him justice However it is not now too late and by the power vested in me for the publick good I adjudge Virginia to be the property of Claudius the plaintiff Go therefore lictors disperse the multitude and make room for a master to repossess himself of his slave"  The lictors in obedience to his command soon drove off the throng that pressed round the tribunal and now they seized upon Virginia and were delivering her up into the hands of Claudius when Virginius who found that all was over seemed to acquiesce in the sentence He therefore mildly entreated Appius to be permitted to take a last farewel of her whom he had long considered as his child and that so satisfied he would return to his duty with fresh alacrity With this the decemvir complied but upon condition that their endearments should pass in his presence Virginius with the most poignant anguish took his almost expiring daughter in his arms he for a  while supported her head upon his breast and wiped away the tears that rolled down her lovely visage and happening to be near the shops that surrounded the Forum he snatched up a knife that lay on the shambles and addressing his daughter  "My dearest lost child cried he this this alone can preserve your honour and your freedom"  So saying he buried the weapon in her breast and then holding it up reeking with the blood of his daughter  "Appius he cried by this blood of innocence I devote thy head to the infernal gods"  Thus saying with the bloody knife in his hand and threatening destruction to whosoever should oppose him he ran through the city wildly calling upon the people to strike for freedom and from thence went to the camp in order to spread a similar flame through the army  He no sooner arrived at the camp followed by a number of his friends but he informed the army of all that was done still holding the bloody knife in his hand He asked their pardon and the pardon of the gods for having committed so rash an action but ascribed it all to the dreadful necessity of the times He implored them by that blood which was dearer to him than his own to redeem their sinking country observing that no military oaths could b  nd them to their commanders who were usurpers all of them and could pretend to no  real authority The army already predisposed immediately with shouts ecchoed their assent and decamping left their generals behind to take their station once more upon mount Aventine whither they had retired about forty years before The other army which had been to oppose the Sabines seemed to feel a similar resentment and came over in large parties to join them  Appius in the mean time did all he could to quell the disturbances in the city but finding the tumult incapable of being controlled and perceiving that his mortal enemies Valerius and Horatius were the most active in opposition he at first attempted to find safety by flight nevertheless being encouraged by Oppius who was one of his colleagues he ventured to assemble the senate and urged the punishment of all deserters The senate however was far from giving him the relief he sought for they foresaw the dangers and miseries that threatened the state in case of opposing the incensed army they therefore dispatched messengers to them offering to restore their former mode of government to which the people joyfully assented and returned to the city if not with the ensigns at least with the pleasure of a triumphant army  Thus ended the decemvirate after having continued somewhat less than three years I have given the picture of this administration  after the Roman historians aggravated with all the invectives with which they usually load it However if there be any part of their history in which they shew a manifest prejudice it is here The charges against the decemviri of rapine and murder are all except one or two merely general and of these which are specicified the facts do not seem aequipollent to the accusation However the limits I have assigned myself in this work are too short to permit a discussion of their veracity and perhaps too it is our wisest way at this distant period to take the accounts as given us by the historians of the time and not to shew an affectation of sagacity by attempting to new state an evidence which has been credited through successive ages All that may be observed is that the laws promulgated by this body of men were reckoned an admirable compilation and ever after in Rome and even in most parts of Europe even to this day have continued among lawyers to be of the greatest authority  CHAP XIII From the expulsion of the Decemviri to the burning of Rome by the Gauls  THE people now freed from a yoke which  they had laid upon themselves elected Valerius and Horatius consuls for the ensuing part of the year and Virginius and Icilius of the number of their tribunes The punishment of the decemviri was what first engaged the attention of these popular magistrates and Appius was appointed a day to answer the charges brought against him of tyranny and murder Oppius one of his colleagues next to him in guilt was also arraigned but both too well saw what mercy they had to expect either from their judges who were professed enemies or from the people whose resentment they had but too frequently incurred they therefore resolved to prevent that fury which they could not withstand and both died by their own hands in prison The other eight went into voluntary exile and Claudius the pretended master of Virginia was driven out after them Thus the vengeance of the tribunes pursued these devoted men and seemed as yet unsatisfied with punishing They were preparing to outgo those  whom they had deposed for cruelty in the very same walks of rage and the senate began to tremble at seeing so many of their members devoted to destruction Duillius however one of the tribunes being more moderate than the rest of his colleagues quieted their fears by openly professing that no more blood should be shed on this occasion that sufficient vengeance had been taken for the death of Virginia and that he forbade all future prosecutions on that account  This in some measure satisfied the senate for the present but they soon found cause of fresh resentment The two new consuls seemed entirely to have abandoned the interests of the patricians and equally popular with the tribunes themselves to study only the gratification of the people They procured a law by which each of the plebeians should in his individual capacity have as much influence in all elections and deliberations whatsoever as any one of the patricians which gave the finishing blow to all distinction between them A law so injurious to the power of the senate produced as may be easily supposed a desire to mortify the consuls who only aimed at encreasing their own influence by the depression of that body An opportunity for this soon offered for the consuls having marched against the Aequi and Sabines gained a complete victory and demanded a triumph  The senate however were resolved not to comply and declared them unworthy of that honour The consuls appealed to the people and complaining loudly against the senate procured a law for the privilege of a triumph by the authority of the plebeians alone Thus did the two orders of the state continue for some years mutually opposing each other the patricians defending the small shadow of distinction which they had left and the people daily insisting upon fresh concessions as if their appetites encreased by what was granted to satisfy them  In the mean time these intestine tumults produced weakness within the state and confidence in the enemy abroad The wars with the Aequi and Volsci still continued and as each year some trifling advantages were obtained over the Romans they at last advanced so far as to make their incursions to the very  walls of Rome But not the courage only of the Romans seemed diminished by these contests but their other virtues also particularly their justice About this time the inhabitants of two neighbouring cities Ardea and Aricia had a contest between themselves about some lands that had long been claimed by both At length being unable to agree they referred it to the senate and the people of Rome The senate had yet some of the principles of primitive justice remaining and refused to determine the  dispute But the people readily undertook the decision and one Scaptius an old man declaring that these very lands of right belonged to Rome they immediately voted themselves to be the legal possessors and sent home the former litigants thoroughly convinced of their own folly and of the Roman injustice  The tribunes now grew more and more turbulent and having come into a principal share in the administration of government nothing would satisfy them without having a participation of the whole With these views they proposed two laws one to permit plebeians to intermarry with patricians and the other to permit them to be admitted to the consulship also The senators received these proposals with their accustomed indignation and seemed resolved to undergo the utmost extremities rather than submit to enacting them However finding their resistance only encrease the commotions of the state they at last consented to pass the law concerning marriages hoping that this concession would satisfy the people But they were to be appeased but for a very short time for returning to their old custom of refusing to enlist upon the approach of the enemy the consuls were forced to hold a private conference with the chief of the senate where after many debates Claudius proposed an expedient as the most probable means of satisfying the people  in the present conjuncture This was by no means to contaminate the consulship by suffering it to come into the hands of the people but to create six or eight governors in the room of consuls whereof one half at least should be patricians This project which was but a poor subterfuge and was in fact granting what the people demanded pleased the whole meeting and that nothing might seem preconcerted among them they agreed that at the next public meeting of the senate the consuls should contrary to their usual custom begin by asking the opinion of the youngest senator whereas formerly they always began by asking that of the senior Upon assembling the senate one of the tribunes accused them of holding secret meetings and managing dangerous designs against the people The consuls on the other hand averred their innocence and to demonstrate their sincerity gave any of the younger members of the house leave to propound their opinions These remaining silent such of the older senators as were known to be popular began by observing that the people ought to be indulged in their request and that none so well deserved power as those who were most instrumental in gaining it and that the city could not be free until all were reduced to perfect equality Claudius as was agreed upon spoke next and though very willing to advance the intentions of those who  spoke before him in order to conceal his designs he broke out into bitter invectives against the people asserting that it was his opinion that the law should not pass This produced some disturbance among the plebeians but at length Genutius as if to moderate between the senate and the people proposed as had been preconcerted that six governors should be annually chosen with consular authority three from the senate and three from the people and that when the time of their magistracy should be expired then it would be seen whether they would have the same office continued or whether the consulship should be established upon its former footing This project was eagerly embraced by the people because it promised something new and leave was given to any of the plebeians to stand for this new office Yet so fickle were the multitude that though many of their own rank stood yet none of them were thought worthy of the honour and the choice wholly fell upon the patricians who offered themselves as candidates Thus a new form of  government was now to be tried the people still mistaking change for improvement These new magistrates were called M  itary Tribunes they were at first but three afterwards they were encreased to four and at length to six They had the power and the ensigns of consuls yet their power being divided among a number  each singly was of less authority The first that were chosen only continued in their office about three months the augurs having found something amiss in the ceremonies of their election  The military tribunes being deposed the consuls once more came into office and in order to lighten the weight of business which they were obliged to sustain a new office was elected namely that of Censors who were to be chosen every fifth year Their business was to take an estimate of the number and estates of the people and to distribute them into their proper classes to inspect into the lives and manners of their fellow citizens to degrade senators for misconduct to dismount knights and to turn down plebeians from their tribes into an inferior in case of misdemeanour The two first censors were Papirius and Sempronius both patricians and from this order they continued to be elected for near an hundred years  This new creation served to restore peace for some time among the orders and a triumph gained over the Volscians by Geganius the consul added to the universal satisfaction that reigned among the people As it was said of the Greeks that a victory gained at the Olympic games raised the conqueror to the highest pitch of human splendour so it might be said of the Romans that a triumph was the greatest honour they had any idea of For this their generals  fought not less than for the benefit of the state the people also when entertained with such spectacles forgot their private distresses in an empty notion of their country's glory  This calm however was but of short continuance for some time after a famine pressing hard upon the poor the usual complaints  against the rich were renewed and these as before proving ineffectual produced new seditions The consuls were accused of neglect in not having laid in proper quantities of corn they however disregarded the murmurs of the populace content with exerting all their care in attempts to supply the pressing necessities But though they did all that could be expected from active magistrates in providing and distributing provisions to the poor yet Spurius Maelius a rich knight who had purchased up all the corn of Tuscany by far outshone them in liberality This patrician who had long beheld the struggles of the state was enflamed with a secret desire of becoming powerful by its contentions he therefore distributed corn in great quantities among the poorer sort each day till at last his house became the asylum of all such as wished to exchange a life of labour for one of lazy dependance When he had thus gained a sufficient number of partizans he procured large quantities of arms to be purchased and brought into  his house by night and formed a plan of conspiracy by which he was to be made commander while some of the tribunes whom he had found means to corrupt were to act under him in seizing upon the liberties of his country Minucius who was at that time appointed to the care of providing for the people soon discovered the plot that was thus formed against their freedom and informing the senate thereof they immediately formed a resolution of creating a dictator who should have the power of quelling the conspiracy without appealing to the people Cincinnatus who was now eighty years old was chosen once more to rescue his country from impending danger He began by summoning Maelius to appear who being as he thought sufficiently supported by the multitude refused to obey He next sent Ahala the master of his horse to force him who meeting him in the Forum and pressing Maelius to follow him to the dictator's tribunal upon his refusal Ahala killed him upon the spot The dictator applauded the resolution of his officer and commanded the conspirator's goods to be sold and his house to be demolished distributing his stores among the people  The tribunes of the people were much enraged at the death of Maelius and in order in some measure to punish the senate at the next election instead of consuls insisted upon restoring  their military tribunes With this the senate were obliged to comply and though the plebeians had a right of being taken into the office three patricians as in the former election were again chosen The next year however the government returned to its ancient channel and consuls were chosen  During these contests the Veians and the Volscians went on with their customary incursions and the very allies of Rome themselves began to waver in their allegiance Fidenae an ancient colony belonging to the Romans revolted to Tolumnius king of the Veians and still more to enhance their crime murdered the ambassadors that were sent to complain of the infidelity To punish this conduct with more signal vengeance a dictator was appointed and the choice fell upon Mamercus Aemilius A victory was obtained over the Veii the king of their nation was slain and Aemilius marched back to Rome with all the ensigns of triumph ennobled by the spoils of a king  It should seem now as if the senate and consuls could carry on no business by their own authority alone since we find them the year following creating another dictator to oppose a threatened confederacy of the Veian nations Servilius Priscus was chosen to this high office The year succeeding we read of Aemilius who  had been dictator so lately before being again chosen He having no employment abroad was resolved to do something at home and accordingly caused the censorship which had been before appointed to continue eight years to be held but for one year and an half for which the censors soon after fined and degraded him upon laying down his office This conduct of theirs on the other hand enraged the people and instead of consuls military tribunes were the next time chosen In about four  years after consuls were introduced again and upon a threatened invasion of the Aequi a dictator Posthumius Tubero was created who closed his dictatorship with a triumph Four  years after this the fluctuation of councils brought up military tribunes again and their want of success in war obliged the people to create Aemilius for the third time dictator who gained another triumph For two years after this military tribunes continued then consuls and then tribunes again thus the state continued to fluctuate between the different ororders for more than fifteen years during which time there was but little of any thing important transacted either abroad or at home the senate seemed to have lost all its authority and the people all their military virtue The former who were possessed of the riches of the state seemed willing to grant all their privileges  in order to secure their property from the Agrarian law and the people employed so much time in attending the harangues of their tribunes that they became poor discontented and noisy Whenever the approach of an enemy was talked of the danger was so magnified by either the fears or the real weakness of the state that nothing but that desperate method of chusing a dictator could be found to oppose it So that in a period of twenty years we find the people above ten times giving up their liberty their possessions and their lives to one of their fellow citizens and only indebted for their safety to his still remaining virtue Thus after Aemilius Servilius Priscus was again chosen whom we have mentioned as thrice dictator  before and after him Cornelius Cossus These absolute magistrates it is true in some measure restored discipline to the army and encreased the territories of the state but it was purchasing conquest too dear to give up all that was valuable in life to obtain it The ill effects indeed of their absolute authority were not discovered till many years after at present the senate seemed pleased with electing a magistrate out of their own body who could intimidate the people the multitude on the other hand were proud to follow and obey one who generally led them to conquest and plunder for the dictators usually divided the spoils of  the conquered towns among them in order to encrease their own popularity Thus the plunder of Anxur a city taken from the Volscians seemed to diffuse a new spirit amongst them which however continued no longer than until their necessities called for a new supply  Things continued in this state of commotion for a long time factions becoming every day stronger and the government weaker the tribunes of the people still augmenting the breach between the orders of the commonwealth and calling their licentiousness liberty At length however the senate hit upon an expedient which served greatly to encrease their own power and at the same time highly pleasing the people though it must be owned it served to shew how greatly the Romans were fallen from their former virtues The citizens who went to the field had hitherto fought their country's battles for nothing they were husbandmen and soldiers the same hands that drew the sword in one season were seen holding the plough in another and they were obliged to furnish not only their own arms but their own provisions during the campaign In these difficulties however they chearfully acquiesced as the hopes of plunder and the honours of returning in triumph were considered as an ample compensation Nevertheless it sometimes fell out that if the campaign was  of long continuance their little farms remained untilled and they themselves were reduced the next season to extreme indigence Hence they were obliged to incur debts and hence proceeded that various train of extortions usuries and petty cruelties which the creditors made use of to oppress the people To remedy these evils the senate unanimously came to a resolution of paying the soldiery out of the treasury and for this purpose they laid on a new tax from which none of the citizens were to be exempted This regulation in some measure gave a new turn to the Roman method of making war as what might before have been called incursions were now become regular lengthened campaigns The senate was now no longer to be obliged to the tribunes in order to raise an army as the people would gladly enlist since they were sure of their reward Nothing therefore could exceed their joy upon this occasion they surrounded the senatehouse with acclamations they offered to follow their conscript fathers wherever they should lead them and promised never to murmur more  The Senate thus reconciled to the people and now become masters of an army that they could keep in the field as long as they thought proper resolved to take signal vengeance of the Veians and besiege their capital city though the attempt should endanger their own The city of Veii  had long been a flourishing strong and formidable place it was seated upon a craggy rock and furnished with resolute and numerous defenders It had lately changed its form of government from republican into that of kingly and such a change being disliked by the allies of this state this contributed in some measure to their tamely suffering it to be surrounded by the Roman army The Romans indeed had every reason to inspire them with resentment The Veians had long been the rivals of Rome they had ever taken the opportunity of its internal distresses to ravage its territories and had even treated its ambassadors sent to complain of these injuries with outrage It seemed now therefore determined that Veii whatever it should cost was to fall and the Romans accordingly sate regularly down before it prepared for a long and painful resistance The strength of the place may be inferred from the continuance of the siege which lasted for ten years during which time the army continued encamped round it lying in winter under tents made of the skins of beasts and in summer driving on the operations of the attack Various was the success and many were the commanders that directed the siege some times all the besiegers works were destroyed and many of their men cut off by sallies from the town sometimes they were annoyed by an  army of Veians who attempted to bring assistance from without A siege so bloody seemed to threaten depopulation to Rome itself by draining its forces continually away so that a law was obliged to be made for all the batchelors to marry the widows of the soldiers who were slain The tribunes of the people also did not fail to render this great undertaking still more arduous by their continual murmurs and skill in raising dissensions at home They blamed the commanders and prohibited the taxes from being raised which were to pay the soldiery and still more to perplex the senate they began to make new proposals for passing the Agrarian law Such dissension among the Romans and so much obstinacy on the part of the Veii began to depress the sanguine expectations of the senate they trembled for the consequences of so much blood and treasure expended in an ineffectual siege therefore willing to strike one vigorous blow before relinquishing their favourite aim they created Furius Camillus dictator and to him was entrusted the sole power of managing the long protracted war Camillus was a man who without intrigue or any sollicitation had raised himself to the first eminence in the state he had been made one of the censors some time before and was considered as the head of that office he was afterwards made a military tribune and had in this  post gained several advantages over the enemy It was his great courage and abilities in the above offices that made him thought most worthy to serve his country on this pressing occasion Upon his appointment numbers of the people flocked to his standard confident of success under so experienced a commander He accordingly drew out his forces against the enemy and overthrew the Falisci one of the little powers confederated against Rome with great slaughter the Capenates also shared the same fate and were obliged to beg protection wherefore being thus master of the field he turned all his force to prosecute the siege of Veii with vigour Conscious however that he was unable to take the city by storm he secretly wrought a mine into it with vast labour which opened into the midst of the citadel Certain thus of success and finding the city incapable of relief he sent to the senate desiring that all who chose to share in the plunder of Veii should immediately repair to the army Then giving his men directions how to enter at the breach the city was instantly filled with his legions to the amazement and consternation of the besieged who but a moment before had rested in perfect security Thus like a second Troy was the city of Veii taken after a ten years siege and with its spoils enriched the conquerors while Camillus himself  transported with the honour of having subdued the rival of his native city triumphed after the manner of the kings of Rome having his chariot drawn by four milkwhite horses a distinction which did not fail to disgust the majority of the spectators as they considered those emblems as sacred and more proper for doing honour to their gods than their generals  The people soon after pretended to find still greater cause of offence Their tribunes had proposed that the senate and people should divide into two parts whereof one should continue in Rome the other should settle at Veii their new conquest This Camillus earnestly opposed and diverted the multitude from their intention though it procured their anger No  were they less displeased with him soon after when they found themselves obliged to restors the tenth part of the plunder they had taken which before the siege he had devoted to Apollo The soldiers for the most part had spent theirs long since so that they would have been incapable of refunding had not the Roman women parted with their golden ornaments to the amount of eight talents of gold to supply them For this generous action they were decreed the privilege of having funeral orations pronounced over their bodies which had not been allowed to women before Camillus  was rendered by this step still more unpopular than before  However in the midst of this general dislike he was some time after created one of the military tribunes and sent against the Falisci who had been making their accustomed incursions upon the Roman territories His usual good fortune attended him in this expedition he routed their army and besieged their capital city Falerii which threatened a long and vigorous resistance The reduction of this little place would have been scarce worth mentioning in this scanty page were it not for an action of the Roman general that has done him more credit with posterity than all his other triumphs united A schoolmaster who had the care of the children belonging to the principal men of the city having found means to decoy them into the Roman camp offered to put them into the hands of Camillus as the surest means of inducing the citizens to a speedy surrender The general was struck with the treachery of a wretch whose duty it was to protect innocence and not to betray it he for some time regarded the traitor with a stern air but at last finding words  "Execrable villain cried the noble Roman offer thy abominable proposals to creatures like thyself and not to me what though we be the enemies of your city yet there are natural ties that bind all  mankind which should never be broken there are duties required from us in war as well as in peace we fight now not against an age of innocence but against men Men who have used us ill indeed but yet whose crimes are virtues when compared to thine Against such base arts let it be my duty to use only Roman arts the arts of valour and of arms"  So saying he immediately ordered him to be stript his hands tied behind him and in that ignominious manner to be whipped into the town by his own scholars This generous behaviour in Camillus effected more than his arms could do the magistrates of the town immediately submitted to the senate leaving to Camillus the conditions of their surrender who only fined them a sum of money to satisfy his army and received them under the protection and into the alliance of Rome  Notwithstanding the veneration which the virtues of Camillus had excited abroad they seemed but little adapted to bring over the respect of the turbulent tribunes at home as they raised some fresh accusation against him every day To the charge of being an opposer of their intended migration from Rome to Veii they added that of his having concealed a part of the plunder of that city particularly two brazen gates for his own use and appointed him a day on which to appear before the people  Camillus finding the multitude exasperated against him upon many pretences and detesting their ingratitude resolved not to await the ignominy of a trial but embracing his wife and children prepared to depart from Rome He had already passed as far as one of the gates unattended on his way and unlamented There however he could suppress his indignation no longer but turning his face to the Capitol and lifting up his hands to heaven he entreated all the gods that his country might one day be sensible of their injustice and ingratitude and so saying he past forward to take refuge at Ardea a town at a little distance from Rome where he afterwards learned that he had been fined fifteen hundred asses by the tribunes at Rome  The tribunes were not a little pleased with their triumph over this great man but they soon had reason to repent their injustice and to wish for the assistance of one who alone was able to protect their country from ruin For now a more terrible and redoubtable enemy began to make its appearance than the Romans had ever yet encountered the Gauls a barbarous nation had about two centuries before made an irruption from beyond the Alps and settled in the northern parts of Italy They had been invited over by the deliciousness of the wines and the softness of the climate Wherever they came they dispossest the original  inhabitants being men of extraordinary stature fierce in aspect barbarous in their manners and prone to emigration Not content with having subdued and peopled most of the northern parts of Italy they were still inviting others from their native desarts beyond the Alps to come over and spread terror and desolation in the fruitful regions of this new discovered country A body of these wild from their original habitations were now besieging Clusium a city of Etruria under the conduct of Brennus their king The inhabitants of Clusium frighted at their numbers and still more at their savage appearance entreated the assistance or at least the mediation of the Romans The senate who long had made it a maxim never to refuse succour to the distressed were willing previously to send ambassadors to the Gauls to dissuade them from their enterprize and to shew the injustice of their irruption Accordingly three young senators were chosen out of the family of the Fabii to manage the commission who seemed rather fitter for the field than the cabinet Brennus received them with a degree of complaisance that argued but little of the barbarian and desiring to know the business of their embassy was answered according to their instructions that it was not customary in Italy to make war but upon just grounds of provocation and that they desired  to know what offence the citizens of Clusium had given to the king of the Gauls To this Brennus sternly replied that the rights of valiant men lay in their swords that the Romans themselves had no other right to the many cities they had conquered and that he had particular reasons of resentment against the people of Clusium as they refused to part with those lands which they had neither hands to till nor inhabitants to occupy The Roman ambassadors who were but little used to bear the language of a conqueror for a while dissembled their resentment at this haughty reply but upon entering the besieged city instead of acting as ambassadors forgetful of their sacred characters they headed the citizens in a sally against the besiegers In this combat Fabius Ambustus killed a Gaul with his own hand but was discovered while he was despoiling him of his armour A conduct so unjust and unbecoming excited the resentment of Brennus who having made his complaint by an herald to the senate and finding no redress immediately broke up the siege and marched away with his conquering army directly to Rome  The countries through which the Gauls passed in their rapid progress gave up all hopes of safety upon their approach being terrified at their vast numbers the fierceness of their  natures and their dreadful preparations for war But the rage and impetuosity of this wild people were directed only against Rome They went on without doing the least injury in their march still breathing vengeance only against the Romans  Six military tribunes at that time commanded the Roman army the number of their forces which amounted to forty thousand men was nearly equal to those of Brennus but the soldiers were less obedient and the generals had neither subordination to assist nor confidence to unite each other The two armies met beside the river Allia eleven miles from the city both equally confident of victory both equally dreading to survive a defeat The leaders on either side put their forces in array the Romans to prevent being surrounded extended their lines and placed their best legions in the wings of their army The Gauls on the other hand by an happy disposition had their choicest men in the middle and with these they made the most desperate attack The centre of the Roman army unable to withstand the impetuosity of the charge quickly gave way while the two wings saw themselves in a manner divided from each other and their centre occupied by the enemy They made for a time a feeble attempt to join each other but finding it impracticable a rout ensued in which the  Romans seemed to have lost all power not only of resistance but of flight Nothing but terror and blind confusion reigned through their scattered troops the wretched remains of their army either were drowned in attempting to cross over the Tyber or went to take refuge in Veii while a few of them returned to Rome with the dreadful account of their country's overthrow All hopes being now over the few remaining inhabitants that were able to bear arms threw themselves into the Capitol which they fortified in order to hold out a siege The rest of the people a poor helpless multitude of old men women and children endeavoured to hide themselves in some of the neighbouring towns or resolved to await the conqueror's fury and end their lives with the ruin of their native city But more particularly the ancient senators and priests struck with a religious enthusiasm on this occasion resolved to devote their lives to atone for the crimes of the people and habited in their robes of ceremony placed themselves in the Forum on their ivory chairs The Gauls in the mean time were giving a loose to their triumph in sharing and enjoying the plunder of the enemies camp had they immediately marched to Rome upon gaining the victory the Capitol itself had been taken but they continued two days feasting upon the field of battle and with  barbarous pleasure exulting amidst their slaughtered enemies On the third day after the victory the easiness of which much amazed the Gauls Brennus appeared with all his forces before the city He was at first much surprized to find the gates wide open to receive him and the walls defenceless so that he began to impute the unguarded situation of the place to a stratagem of the Romans After proper precautions however he entered the city and marching into the Forum there beheld the ancient senators sitting in their order observing a profound silence unmoved and undaunted▪ The splendid habits the majestic gravity and the venerable looks of these old men who had all in their time borne the highest offices of the state awed the barbarous enemy into reverence they took them to be the tutelar deities of the place and began to offer blind adoration till one more forward than the rest put forth his hand to stroak the beard of Papyrius whom we have already seen enjoying the dignity of dictator This insult the noble Roman could not endure but lifting up his ivory scepter struck the savage to the ground This seemed as a signal for general slaughter Papyrius fell first and all the rest shared his fate without mercy or distinction Thus the fierce invaders pursued their slaughter for three days successively sparing neither sex nor age  and then setting fire to the city burnt down every house to the ground  All the hopes of Rome were now placed in  the Capitol every thing without that fortress was but an extensive scene of misery desolation and despair All the magnificent buildings which were once the pride of Rome were now become an heap of shapeless ruin Nor was it the city alone that felt the utmost rage of the conquerors but all the neighbouring towns that were accessible to their incursions shared the same fate and were burnt without compassion Still however the citadel remained and Brennus tried every art to reduce it into his power he first summoned it with threats to surrender but in vain he then resolved to besiege it in form and hemmed it round with his army The Romans however repelled his attempts with great bravery despair had supplied them with that perseverance and vigour which they seemed to want when in prosperity  The siege had now continued for above six months the provisions of the garrison were almost exhausted their numbers lessened with continual fatigue and nothing seemed to remain but death or submitting to the mercy of the conquerors which was worse even than death itself They had resolved upon dying when they were revived from their despondence by the appearance of a man whom they saw climbing up the rock  and whom they knew upon his arrival to be a messenger from their friends abroad This messenger's name was Pontius Comminus who had swam across the Tyber by night passed through the enemies guards and with extreme satigue climbed up the Capitoline rock with tidings to the besieged that Camillus their old dictator was levying an army for their relief that he had already surprized a body of the Gauls in one of their excursions and had cut them off to a man that the citizens of Ardea and Veii had armed in his favour and had made him their general and that he only awaited their confirmation of the choice to enter the field and give the barbarians battle The Romans were struck with a mixture of rapture and confusion to find that the man whom they had formerly spurned from the city was now in its desperate state become its defender They instantly chose him for their dictator and prepared to sustain the siege with recruited vigour Thus the messenger having received his answer and proper instructions returned the way he came not without encountering the utmost difficulties  In the mean while Brennus carried on the siege with extreme ardour he hoped in time to starve the garrison into a capitulation but they sensible of his intent although they were in actual want caused several loaves to be  thrown into his camp to convince him of the futility of such expectations His hopes failing in this were soon after revived when some of his soldiers came to inform him that they had discovered some footsteps which led up to the rock and by which they supposed the Capitol might be surprized Accordingly a chosen body of his men were ordered by night upon this dangerous service which they with great labour and difficulty almost effected they were now got upon the very wall the Roman centinel was fast asleep their dogs within gave no signal and all promised an instant victory when the garrison was awaked by the gaggling of some sacred geese that had been kept in the temple of Juno The besieged soon perceived the imminence of their danger and each snatching the weapon he could find instantly  an to oppose the assailants Manlius a patrician of acknowledged bravery was the first who exerted all his strength and inspired courage by his example He boldly mounted the rampart and at one effort threw two Gauls headlong down the precipice others soon came in to his assistance and the walls were cleared of the enemy in a space of time shorter than the description  From this time forward the hopes of the barbarians began to decline and Brennus wished for an opportunity of raising the siege with  credit His soldiers had often conferences with the besieged while upon duty and the proposals for an accommodation were wished for by the common men before the chiefs thought of a congress At length the commanders on both sides came to an agreement that the Gauls should immediately quit the city and territories of Rome upon being paid a thousand pound weight of gold This agreement being confirmed by oath on either side the gold was brought forth but upon weighing the Gauls attempted fraudulently to kick the beam of which the Romans complaining Brennus insulting cast his sword and belt into the scale crying out that the only portion of the vanquished was to suffer By this reply the Romans saw that they were at the victor's mercy and knew it was vain to expostulate against the conditions he should be pleased to impose But in this very juncture and while they were thus debating upon the payment it was told them that Camillus their dictator was at the head of a large army hastening to their relief and entering the gates of Rome Camillus accordingly appeared soon after and entering the place of controversy with the air of one who was resolved not to suffer imposition he demanded the cause of the contest of which being informed he ordered the gold to be taken and carried back to the  Capitol  "for it has ever been cried he the manner with us Romans to ransom our country not with gold but with iron it is I only that am to make peace as being the dictator of Rome and my sword alone shall purchase it"  Upon this a battle ensued in which the Gauls were entirely routed and such a slaughter followed that the Roman territories were soon cleared of their formidable invaders  The enemy was now vanquished but Rome continued an heap of ruins no part of its former magnificence remained except the Capitol and the greatest number of its former inhabitants had gone to take refuge in Veii The tribunes of the people therefore these men unheard of but in the calm of peace began once more to urge for the removal of the poor remains of Rome to Veii where they might have houses to shelter and walls to defend them On this occasion Camillus was steady to his former principles he attempted to appease them with all the arts of persuasion observing that it was unworthy of them both as Romans and as men to desert the venerable seats of their ancestors where they had been encouraged by repeated marks of divine approbation to remove to and inhabit a city which they had conquered and which wanted even the good fortune of defending itself By these and such like remonstrances he prevailed upon the  people to go contentedly to work and Rome soon began to rise from its ashes though with diminished beauty  These successes of Camillus were in some measure but preparatory to future victories He was made dictator the next year upon an irruption  of the neighbouring states and gained another triumph and about three years after overthrew the Latins who had revolted from Rome after an obedience of more than an hundred years continuance These successes served to render Camillus almost absolute in Rome▪ his moderation and patriotism however prevented his making a wrong use of his power unless we may consider his conduct with regard to Manlius Capitolinus as an act of severity  We have already seen the bravery of Manlius in defending the Capitol and saving the last remains of Rome For this the people were by no means ungrateful having built him an house near the place where his valour was so conspicuous and having appointed him a publick fund for his support But his ambition was not to be satisfied with such trifling rewards he still aspired at being not only equal to Camillus but to be sovereign of Rome With this view he laboured to ingratiate himself with the populace paid their debts and railed at the patricians whom he called their  oppressors The senate was not ignorant of his discourses or his designs and created Cornelius Cossus dictator under pretext of sending him against the Volscians who had made some successful irruptions into the Roman territories but in reality with a view to curb the ambition of Manlius The dictator soon finished his expedition against the foreign enemy by a victory and upon his return called Manlius to an account and put him in prison for his conduct at home Manlius however was too much the darling of the populace to be affected by the power of Cossus his partizans were too loud in their clamours to permit any injury to be done to their favourite Cossus was obliged to lay down his office and Manlius was carried from confinement in triumph This success only served to enflame his ambition He now began to talk of a division of the lands among the people he now insinuated that there should be no distinctions in the state and to give weight to his discourses he always appeared at the head of a large body of the dregs of the people whom his largesses had made his followers The city being thus filled with sedition and clamour the senate were obliged to have recourse to another expedient and to oppose the power of Camillus to his Camillus accordingly being made one of the military tribunes appointed Manlius a day  to answer for his life The place in which he was tried was near the Capitol where when he was accused of sedition and aspiring at sovereignty he only turned his eyes thither and pointing put them in mind of what he had done for his country there The multitude whose compassion or whose justice seldom spring from rational motives refused to condemn him while he pleaded in sight of the Capitol but when he was brought from thence to the Peteline grove and where the Capitol was no longer to be seen they condemned him to be thrown headlong from the Tarpeian rock Thus the place which had been the theatre of his glory became that of his punishment and infamy His house in which his conspiracies had been secretly carried on was ordered to be razed to the ground and his family were forbid ever after to assume the name of Manlius  The death of Manlius in some measure renewed the murmurs of the tribunes and the people against Camillus whom they considered as the chief instrument of his prosecution ever unwilling to suppose themselves guilty of a severity to which they had given their consent they began to turn their resentment upon the most worthy man of the state as if to aggravate their baseness However Camillus was never as it should seem to want an opportunity of bringing them back to their veneration for him  Being chosen military tribune a sixth time though much against his consent he with his colleague Lucius marched against the Volscians Lucius all eagerness to engage the enemy Camillus tempering his courage with moderation This backwardness for the attack Lucius ascribed to the timidity of old age or the envy of a man unwilling to participate his fame he therefore took the opportunity when Camillus was sick and obliged to keep his bed to lead on his forces to the attack But he too soon perceived the temerity of his conduct his army was almost defeated and an universal flight was going to ensue when Camillus rouzed from his bed and being helped on horseback old and infirm as he was he put himself at the head of a small body of men opposing those that fled and bringing them once more furiously up against their pursuers The intrepidity of one man spread itself through the whole army his soldiers quickly rallied resolving never to forsake a general under whom they had so often fought with victory The enemy being thus repulsed the combat was renewed the day following in which they were totally defeated and Camillus returned to Rome once more loaden with the spoils of conquest But  conquests abroad seemed only new occasions for dissensions at home for the debtors began to complain of their hardships as formerly The  inhabitants of Praeneste a town belonging to the Latins also made incursions upon the Roman territories to quell these internal and external grievances Quintius Cincinnatus was chosen dictator who took Praeneste by surrender and returned in triumph with the statue of Jupiter Imperator which he placed in the Capitol a circumstance which though of little seeming importance first excited the desire of extending conquest among the Romans  Two years after this the contests between the patricians and tribunes broke out with more than usual violence Many of the plebeians during the distresses of their country had either by accident or courage acquired large fortunes and this produced a desire of sharing not only in the government but the honours of Rome The people as we have seen had before this aspired at the consulship and the senate as has been related by a trifling subterfuge granted them military tribunes which were possessed of consular power but this it seems was not sufficient to satisfy their pride the tribunes of the people now therefore renewed their claims while the poorer part of the citizens only intent upon acquiring the necessaries of life and but little touched with its honours were calm spectators of the contest they only wanted something to strike the imagination in order to interest them in the cause and this at last offered  Fabius Ambustus a tribune of the people had two daughters one of whom he married to a patrician the other to a plebeian The plebeian's wife coming one day to visit her sister was struck with envy at the honours which the latter received in consequence of her patrician alliance and from envying fell into a settled melancholy Her father and husband for a long time conjured her to tell them the reasons of this alteration in her disposition which she at last unwillingly revealed The father though himself a patrician to comfort his daughter was prevailed upon to give her assurances that he would instantly use every means in his power to make her an equal sharer in the dignities of the state with her sister and not to be deficient in his promise from that time consulted with her husband about preferring a law for making one consul out of the body of the people Their first step was to get the husband elected a tribune of the people and then in order to ingratiate themselves with the multitude they proposed with the same law which made pretensions to the consulship that the Agrarian law for the equal partition of lands should also be passed a measure which they knew must give popularity to their ambition The contests in consequence of this proposal were so violent that for five  years no supreme magistrate was chosen the  tribunes of the people and aediles governing all the time if that might be called government which was little better than anarchy and confusion The military tribunes then came into government and after two years were elapsed in this manner Camillus was chosen  dictator who finding the people resolute in their designs of chusing a plebeian consul laid down his office Upon his resignation another dictator was chosen by the senate but this high office had been now so often created where there was no absolute necessity that its authority began to decline while that of the tribunes rose upon its ruins This dictator's name was Manlius Capitolinus he seems to have little remarkable in his conduct if we except his creating Licinius Stolo his master of the horse who was the first plebeian who enjoyed that dignity Stolo was the first also who caused a law to be passed that no man should possess above five hundred acres of land which was greatly disadvantageous to the patricians but what is still more particular he was soon after found desirous of privately possessing more land than by his own law he was entitled to share and in consequence thereof was punished by his own edict  In this manner the flame of contention was carried on between the two orders of the state with acrimony and perseverance while foreign  enemies only served to allay but not to extinguish it Another invasion of the Gauls to oppose whom Camillus was a fifth time made dictator for a time repressed and gave a transient pause to these internal commotions The dread of this people was so great among the Romans then that a law was made that priests should be excused from all wars unless in an invasion of the Gauls However Camillus taught his countrymen the way to subdue them Being sensible that the chief weapon of this fierce people was the sword he furnished his soldiers with iron helmets and had their targets bound round with brass and at the same time taught them the art of using their own arms to the best advantage By these means he rendered the swords of the Gauls so unserviceable that giving them battle near the river Anio he gained an easy victory so that the Romans now began to despise the Gauls and wonder at their own former pusillanimity  A victory like this it might be supposed would have rendered Camillus absolute at Rome But it seems that whether from his advanced age or the encreasing power of the tribunes he had by this time fallen even from the share of authority he was once possessed of The  law for creating a plebeian consul being still agitated with encreasing animosity the senate as usual strongly opposed it forbidding Camillus  to lay down his dictatorship in hopes that under the influence of his power they might be able to support their honour against the pretensions of the people In consequence of this while Camillus was one day sitting upon his tribunal dispatching public affairs the tribunes ordered that the votes of the people should be taken upon their favourite measure and upon the dictator's opposing they sent a lictor to arrest and conduct him to prison Such a mark of indignity offered to a magistrate who had been hitherto held sacred raised a greater commotion than had been hitherto seen in Rome The patricians who stood round the dictator▪ boldly repulsed the lictors while the people who stood below with equal fury cried out Down with him Down with him In this universal uproar Camillus was the only person that seemed unmoved He entreated that the tribunes would give a moment's pause to their attempts then calling the senators round him and conducting them to a neighbouring temple he entreated them to give peace to the city by their compliance then turning his face towards the Capitol as if to take a last farewel of all future endeavours to serve his country he vowed to build a temple to Concord in case he saw peace restored to the people In consequence of his advice a law was made that one of the consuls for the future should be chosen  from the plebeians Sextius who had long been a turbulent tribune of the people was the first plebeian consul that was chosen After him succeeded Licinius the husband of her whom we have already mentioned as languishing with the desire of dignity There were also at this time two new magistrates created from among the patricians namely a Praetor who was to supply the place of consul in the absence of that magistrate and to administer justice to the people in civil and criminal cases an officer so necessary to the state that the number of praetors was in after ages encreased to sixteen There were also two Curule Aediles created officers so called to distinguish them from the aediles of the people the former having the chair and other ensigns of magistracy attending them which the latter were denied Their chief business was to have the care of the great and public games and of the corn and provisions taken in war Thus Camillus having spent a long life being now above eighty in the service of his country throughout which having shewn a courage not to be shaken by danger and a patriotism which even the ingratitude of the people could not alter laid down the dictatorship and built a temple to Concord according to his vow which however he survived but two years dying of the plague and  leaving behind him the reputation of being the second founder of Rome  It was in vain however that measures were taken to ensure a lasting reconciliation between the patricians and the people their disputes revived upon every occasion for whenever new magistrates were to be chosen each party trying all their interest to have the election in their own favour hesitated not to use both fraud and violence to compass their desires Thus the senate suspended all measures against the foreign enemy lest the plebeian consul newly elected should come in for a share of the glory Thus also the people soon after obtained by their complaints to have the curule aediles chosen every second year out of their own body and even at length prevailed to have Marcus Rutilius a plebeian made dictator  To balance this the year following the patricians took away the consulship from the people after they had enjoyed it ten years and four years after they were obliged to restore it The election of a censor produced equal animosity and after many contests the plebeian who had been dictator was elected to the office against the united endeavours of the patricians  During these contests at home however we are not to suppose that the Romans were unemployed or unsuccessful in their foreign wars They obtained a signal victory over the Hernici  so that Claudius Crassinus the dictator had  the honour of an ovation allowed him by the senate They obtained another over the Gauls and Quintus Pennus the dictator returned with  a triumph Two succeeding victories were gained over the same people by two different dictators namely Servilius Ahala and Sulpicius Deticus who both triumphed in their turn We read of two other dictators namely Manlius Torquatus and Caius Julius who being created without any great necessity did little and consequently served to lessen the authority of the dictatorship We read of a fourth triumph over the Gauls by Furius Camillus who was created dictator to oppose them The Arunci also a people beyond the Volsci made some incursions but were repulsed by Camillus who was created dictator a second time for that purpose  Nor were dictators created only for thus repelling the sudden incursions of the enemy but for much more trifling purposes in the times of a plague we find one created namely Manlius Capitolinus merely to drive a nail as a means of putting a stop to the contagion This unimportant business he executed with great ceremony driving it on the right side of Jupiter's temple into the Capitol Two dictators  also were successively chosen merely to held the Comitium or assembly of the people  for a new election of consuls Furius Camillus and Manlius Torquatus being chosen for these unimportant purposes  In this manner therefore the Romans went gradually forward with a mixture of turbulence and superstition within their walls and successful enterprizes without Their contentions at home making their wars abroad less painful and fatiguing naturally produced in them a turn to military glory Their superstition also served as an help to their progress for when the bonds of authority no longer prevailed the priests were always sure to hold the people by the ties of religion What an implicit obedience they placed in their pontiffs we have already seen in many instances and how far they might be impelled even to encounter death itself at their command will  evidently appear from the behaviour of Curtius about this time who upon the opening of a gulph in the Forum which the gods indicated would never close up till the most precious thing in Rome was thrown into it leaped with his horse and armour instantly into the midst saying that nothing was more truly valuable than patriotism and military virtue The gulph say the historians closed immediately upon him and he was never seen more Such a spirit of religion and so many advantages by following war had extended  their dominions already above double what they were in the times of the kings However their principal actions hitherto were against their nearest neighbours in which they chiefly acted upon the defensive but we are shortly to behold another scene where their ambition catches fire and is not appeased till the limits of the world itself seems to put bounds to the conflagration  CHAP XIV From the wars of the Samnites and the wars with Pyrrhus to the beginning of the first Punic war when the Romans first went out of Italy  WE are now come to that period when all the peculiar privileges of patricians were but an empty name and when wealth chiefly made distinction The state has appeared hitherto an obscure unnoted commonwealth formidable only to the petty nations round it and struggling less for conquest than selfpreservation But the Romans having now triumphed over the Sabines the Etrurians the Latins the Hernici the Aequi and the Volscians began to look for greater conquests They accordingly turned their arms against the Samnites a people about an hundred miles east from the city  The Samnites were an hardy nation descended from the Sabines inhabiting a large tract of southern Italy which at this day makes a considerable part of the kingdom of Naples They were equally powerful both in numbers and discipline with the Romans and had like them confederated states to assist them Two such aspiring neighbours both equally fond of arms and living by war could not long want a pretext for a rupture The pretended occasion of this was that the Samnites had oppressed the Sidicini who being too weak to manage the war alone called in the Campanians to their assistance who also being overthrown implored the assistance of Rome The senate for some time to give a colour of justice to their ambition seemed to defer granting aid against the Samnites as being their friends and allies but the importunate entreaties of the Campanian ambassadors and the offers of the rich luxurious country which they inhabited and still more the refusal of the Samnites to desist from ravaging a country which the Romans considered as their own determined them to undertake the war Valerius Corvus and Cornelius were the two consuls to whose care it first fell to manage this dreadful tontention between rival states that for the space of sixty years after deluged Italy with blood Valerius was one of the greatest commanders in his  time he was surnamed Corvus from a strange circumstance of being assisted by a crow in a single combat in which he fought and killed a Gaul of a gigantic stature To his colleague's care it was consigned to lead an army to Samnium the enemies capital while Corvus was sent to relieve Capua the capital of the Campanians Never was captain more fitted to his soldiers than he To an habit naturally robust and athletic he joined the gentlest manners he was the fiercest and yet the most goodnatured man in the army and while the meanest centinel was his companion no man kept them more strictly to their duty but what completes his character he constantly endeavoured to preserve his dignities by the same arts with which he gained them Such soldiers as the Romans then were hardened by their late adversity and led on by such a general were unconquerable The Samnites were the bravest men they ever yet encountered and the contention between them was managed on both sides with the most determined resolution But the fortune of Rome prevailed the Samnites at length fled averring that they were not able to withstand the fierce looks and the firedarting eyes of the Romans The other consul however was not at first so fortunate for having unwarily led his army into a defile he was in danger of being cut off had not Decius  a tribune in the army possessed himself of an hill which commanded the enemy so that the Samnites being attacked on either side were defeated with great slaughter not less than thirty thousand of them being left dead in the field of battle  Soon after the inhabitants of Capua requested to have a Roman garrison to winter there to secure them from the insults of the Samnites Their desire was accordingly complied with but Capua was ever noted for being the destroyer of military discipline and for enervating its protectors It offered so many delights and gratified so largely all the softer passions that the Roman garrison began to lose not only their courage but their virtue They formed a design of destroying the inhabitants and taking the town to themselves This design they communicated to their companions in other parts of the country and they as readily embraced the proposal At length however it came to the notice of the officers who detesting so much baseness led the legions into the field and kept them in action in order to prevent their returning to their former designs But notwithstanding the care of the general and officers the soldiers finding themselves liable to the severest punishments for their late perfidious schemes began to mutiny and uniting themselves into one body marched directly  forward for Rome For some time they were without a leader no man being bold enough or base enough to head an army whose confederating principle was treachery At length they forced Quintius an old and eminent soldier who was then residing in the country to be their leader and conducted by their rage more than their general came within eight miles of the city So terrible an enemy almost at the gates not a little alarmed the senate who immediately created Valerius Corvus dictator and sent him forth with another army to oppose them The two armies were now drawn up against each other while fathers and sons beheld themselves prepared to engage in opposite causes Any other general but Corvus might have brought this civil war to an extremity but he knowing his influence among the soldiery instead of going forward to meet the mutineers in an hostile manner went with the most cordial friendship to embrace his old acquaintance  "I have had cried he my friends opportunities enough of shewing my valour in war I now only want to acquire reputation by making peace You cannot distrust me my friends or think Valerius Corvus can ever be severe who never yet got one law enacted in the senate that was contrary to your interests You cannot think he will be severe whose austerities were ever  practised only upon himself But whatever you do I am resolved to behave as becomes me if I draw my sword it shall not be till you have drawn yours first if blood must be shed you shall begin the slaughter But whom will you destroy Not your enemies not the Samnites or the Volscians but your fathers brothers children countrymen and in the view of these very mountains that gave you birth and education together But let it not be so You Quintius if indeed you are the commander of this shameful expedition have only to ask with reason and we will grant with mercy"  The whole army seemed assected with this speech Quintius as their speaker only desired to have their defection from their duty forgiven and as for himself as he was innocent of their conspiracy he had no reason to sollicit pardon for any offence Thus this defection which at first threatened such dangers to Rome was repaired by the prudence and moderation of a general whose ambition it was to be gentle to his friends and formidable only to his enemies The mutineers were once more received into favour and the dictator having no further employment abroad laid down his office  In the mean while as the war with the Samnites was for some time carried on with various  success a peace was concluded which seemed so offensive to the Latins and the Campanians that it induced them to revolt The former carried their demands so far as to insist that one of the consuls and half the senate should be chosen out of their body before they would submit to think of peace The Romans at first tried by gentle means to turn them from their purpose but they insisted upon it still more resolutely ascribing the lenity of Rome to its fears In order therefore to chastize them the two consuls Manlius Torquatus and his colleague Decius Mus were sent by the senate to invade their country However the Latins were not remiss in their preparations for a defence so that the two armies met with equal animosity and a bloody and obstinate battle ensued In this battle the strict discipline of the Romans and their amazing patriotism were displayed in a manner that has excited rather the wonder than the admiration of posterity As the Latins and Romans were a neighbouring people and their habits arms and language were the same the most exact discipline was necessary to prevent confusion in the engagement Orders therefore were issued by Manlius the consul that no soldier should leave his ranks upon whatever provocation and that he should be certainly put to death who offered to do otherwise With these injunctions both armies  were drawn out in array and ready to begin when Metius the general of the enemies cavalry pushed forward from his lines and challenged any knight in the Roman army to single combat For some time there was a general pause no soldier offering to disobey his orders till Titus Manlius the consul's son burning with shame to see the whole body of the Romans intimidated boldly singled out against his adversary The soldiers on both sides for a while suspended the general engagement to be spectators of this fierce encounter The two champions drove their horses against each other with great violence Metius wounded his adversary's horse in the neck but Manlius with better fortune killed that of Metius The Latin being thus fallen to the ground for a while attempted to support himself upon his shield but the Roman followed his blows with so much force that he laid him dead as he was endeavouring to rise and then despoiling him of his armour returned in triumph to the consul his father's tent where he was preparing and giving orders relative to the engagement Howsoever he might have been applauded by his fellow soldiers being as yet doubtful of the reception he should find from his father he came with hesitation to lay the enemy's spoils at his feet and with a modest air insinuated that what he did was entirely from  a spirit of hereditary virtue But he was soon dreadfully made sensible of his error when his father turning away ordered him to be led publickly forth before the army Here being brought forward the consul with a stern countenance and yet with tears spoke as follows  "Titus Manlius as thou hast regarded neither the dignity of the consulship nor the commands of thy father as thou hast destroyed military discipline and set a pattern of disobedience by thy example thou hast reduced me to the deplorable extremity of sacrificing my son or my country But let us not hesitate in this dreadful alternative a thousand lives were well lost in such a cause nor do I think that thou thyself will refuse to dye when thy country is to reap the advantage of thy sufferings Go Lictor bind him and let his death be our future example"  The whole army was struck with horror at this unnatural mandate fear for a while kept them in suspense but when they saw their young champion's head struck off and his blood streaming upon the ground they could no longer contain their execrations and their groans His dead body was carried forth without the camp and being adorned with the spoils of the vanquished enemy it was buried with all the pomp of military distress  In the mean time the battle joined with mutual fury and as the two armies had often fought under the same leaders they combated with all the animosity of a civil war The Latins chiefly depended on their bodily strength the Romans on their invincible courage and conduct Forces so nearly matched seemed only to require the protection of their deities to turn the scale of victory and in fact the augurs had foretold that whatever part of the Roman army should be distrest the commander of that part should devote himself for his country and die as a sacrifice to the immortal gods Manlius commanded the right wing and Decius led on the left Both sides fought for some time with doubtful success as their courage was equal but after a time the left wing of the Roman army began to give ground It was then that Decius who commanded there resolved to devote himself for his country and to offer his own life as an atonement to save his army Thus determined he called out to Manlius with a loud voice and demanded his instructions as he was the chief Pontiff how to devote himself and the form of the words he should use By his directions therefore being cloathed in a long robe his head covered and his arms stretched forward standing upon a javelin he devoted himself to the celestial and infernal gods for the safety of Rome  Then being armed and on horseback he drove furiously into the the midst of the enemies carrying terror and consternation wherever he came till he fell covered with wounds In the mean time the Roman army considered his devoting himself in this manner as an assurance of success nor was the superstition of the Latins less powerfully influenced by his resolution a total route began to ensue the Romans pressed them on every side and so great was the carnage that scarce a fourth part of the enemy survived the defeat This was the last battle of any consequence that the Latins had with the Romans they were forced to beg a peace upon hard conditions and two years after their strongest city Paedum being taken they were brought into an entire submission to the Roman power  The Samnites however were still unconquered a peace had been made with them some time before which neither side seemed long inclined to preserve Their giving assistance to the Campanians who had formerly begged the protection of the Romans against them and now entreated theirs against Rome renewed a war which though intermitted by various treaties and suspensions was to end only with the ruin of the state For some time indeed the fate of either nation seemed uncertain for though the Samnites were in general worsted  a signal disgrace which the Romans sustained  about this time made a pause in their usual good fortune and turned the scale for a while in the enemies favour The senate having denied the Samnites peace Pontius their general was resolved to gain by stratagem what he had frequently lost by force Accordingly leading his army to a defile called Claudium and taking possession of all its outlets he sent ten of his soldiers habited like shepherds with directions to throw themselves in the way the Romans were to march Exactly to his wishes the Roman consul met them and taking them for what they appeared demanded the route the Samnite army had taken they with seeming indifference replied that they were gone to Luceria a town in Apulia and were then actually besieging it The Roman general not suspecting the stratagem that was laid against him marched directly by the shortest road which lay through the defiles to relieve the city and did not find himself deceived till he saw his army surrounded and blocked up on every side The Samnites having the Roman army at this great disadvantage immediately sent off to Herennius their general's father for instructions how to proceed The old crafty Samnite who knew the disposition of the Romans and that a fierce enemy was either to be entirely vanquished or entirely won advised his  son either indiscriminately to the sword or to dismiss them all without shame or injury urging at the same time that one of these two ways was absolutely necessary the first would incapacitate them from future annoyance the last would lay them under an obligation which they could never remove This counsel though the most prudent that could be imagined was rejected a middle way was taken which only served to exasperate the Romans but not to subdue them Pontius first obliged their army to pass under the yoke having been previously stript of all but their under garments he then stipu  ated that they should wholly quit the territories of the Samnites and that they should continue to live upon terms of former confederacy The Romans were constrained to submit to this ignominious treaty and marched into Capua disarmed halfnaked and burning with a desire of retrieving their lost honour When the army arrived at Rome the whole city was most surprisingly afflicted at their shameful return Nothing but fury and revenge appeared on every face while the consuls who were the unfortunate instruments of their disgrace refused to appear abroad or to perform the necessary functions of their office A dictator was chosen who had no opportunity of acting he laid down his office and the state continued for some time without any supreme  magistrate at its head nothing but grief and resentment was to be seen and the whole city was put into mourning  But this was but a transitory calamity the state had suffered a diminution of its glory but not of its power it only therefore sought an opportunity of breaking a compact which the army had made merely by compulsion The two consuls who had entered into this treaty offered themselves up to the enemy as being the only persons that could be called to account but Pontius who justly observed that the lives of two men were not an equivalent for those of an army refused to receive the forfeit and sent them back greatly exclaiming against the perfidiousness of Rome The war was now therefore renewed and the Samnites overthrown in several battles the Romans serving them as they themselves had been treated before These successes produced a truce of two years which when expired the war was carried on as usual for many years the power of the Samnites declining every day while the Romans gathered fresh confidence from every victory Under the conduct of Papyrius Cursor who was at different times consul and dictator repeated triumphs were gained Fabius Maximus also had his share in the glory of conquering them and Decius the son of that Decius whom we have seen devoting himself for his country about  forty years before followed the example of his noble father and rushing into the midst of the enemy saved the lives of his countrymen by the loss of his own It may seem indeed strange how the Samnites could so long continue to make head against the Roman power but we must consider that they were aided by all the little states round them who were either attached to them by interest or united by a jealousy of Rome's growing greatness Thus the Tarentines the Lucani the Thurini and all the southern states of Italy by turns sent assistance which for a while checked the progress of the conquerors But their stop was of short duration both they as well as the Samnites after repeated defeats saw themselves at last stripped of their cities and the greatest part of their country they saw themselves at the end of a long war quite exhausted near two hundred thousand of their bravest men being killed in battle In this distress as the Italian states were unable to defend themselves they were obliged to call in the assistance of a foreign power and had recourse to Pyrrhus king of Epirus to save them from impending ruin  Pyrrhus a king of great courage ambition and power had always kept the example of Alexander his great predecessor before his eyes he was reckoned the most experienced general of his time and commanded a body of  troops then supposed to be the best disciplined of all the nations round them The Romans were now therefore no longer to combat with a tumultuary force raised in times of exigence and depending on their courage alone for victory they were to oppose an army levied amongst the most polished people then existing formed under the greatest generals and led on by the most noted commander of his time Pyrrhus as was said having been applied to for succour by the Tarentines who in the name of all the declining states of Italy conjured him to save them from the threatening distress promised to come to their assistance In the mean time he dispatched over a body of three thousand men under the command of Cineas an experienced soldier and a scholar of the great orator Demosthenes Nor did he himself remain long behind but soon after put to sea with three thousand horse twenty thousand foot and twenty elephants in which the commanders of that time began to place very great confidence Only a small part however of these great preparations arrived in Italy with him for many of his ships were dispersed and some totally lost in a tempest Upon his arrival at Tarentum his first care was to reform the people he came to succour for observing a total dissolution of manners in this luxurious city and how the inhabitants were rather occupied with the pleasures  of bathing feasting and dancing than in preparing for war he gave orders to have all their places of public entertainment shut up and that they should be restrained in all these amusements that render soldiers unfit for battle He attempted to repress their licentious manner of treating their governors and even summoned some who had mentioned his own name with ridicule to appear before him However he was prevented from punishing them by their ingenuous manner of confessing the charge  "Yes cried they we have spoken all this against you and would have said still more but that we had no more wine"  But though he forgave them with a smile he took the most prudent precautions to guard himself against their wellknown insincerity sending his son out of the city and removing all those he suspected most forward to promote sedition In the mean time the Romans did all that prudence could suggest to oppose so formidable an enemy and the consul Laevinus was sent with a numerous army to interrupt his progress Wherefore Pyrrhus though his whole army was not yet arrived drew out to meet him but previously sent an ambassador desiring to be permitted to mediate between the Romans and the people of Tarentum To this Laevinus returned for answer that he neither esteemed him as a mediator nor feared him as an enemy and  then leading the ambassador through the Roman camp desired him to observe diligently what he saw and report the result to his master  War being thus determined on either part both armies approaching pitched their tents in sight of each other upon the opposite banks of the river Lyris Pyrrhus was always extremely careful in directing the situation of his own camp and in observing that of the enemy It was here that walking along the banks of the river and surveying the Roman method of encamping  "These barbarians cried he turning to one of his favourites seem to me to be no way barbarous and I fear we shall too soon find their actions equal to their resolution"  However ordering a body of men along the banks of the river he placed them in readiness to oppose the Romans in case they should attempt to ford it before his whole army was brought together Things turned out according to his expectations the consul with an impetuosity that marked his inexperience gave orders for passing the river where it was fordable and the Epirean advancedguard having attempted to oppose him in vain were obliged to retire to the main body of their army Pyrrhus being apprized of the enemies attempt at first hoped to cut off their cavalry before they could be reinforced by the foot that were not as yet got over and led on in person a chosen  body of horse against them It was on this occasion that he shewed himself equal to his great reputation he was constantly seen at the head of his men leading them on with spirit yet directing them with calmness at once performing the office of a general and the duty of a common soldier he shewed the greatest presence of mind joined to the greatest valour He was chiefly conspicuous by the nobleness of his air and the richness of his armour so that wherever he appeared the throng of the battle was gathered round him In the midst of the engagement his horse happening to be killed under him he was obliged to change armour with one of his attendants and go to another part of the combat that required his immediate presence Mean while the Roman knights mistaking this attendant for the king himself levelled all their attempts that way and at last slew him and carried his armour to the consul The report being spread through both armies that the king was slain the Greeks were struck with a general panic and the Romans began to assure themselves of victory But Pyrrhus in the instant came bareheaded into the van and repeatedly crying out that he still lived he inspired his soldiers with new vigour At length the Roman legions had advanced across the river and the engagement was become general the Greeks fought with a consciousness of their former  fame and the Romans with a desire of gaining fresh glory mankind had never before seen two such differently disciplined armies opposed to each other nor is it to this day determined whether the Greek phalanx or the Roman l  gion were preferable The combat was long in suspense the Romans had seven times repulsed the enemy and were as often driven back themselves but at length while the success seemed doubtful Pyrrhus sent his elephants into the midst of the engagement and these turned the scale of victory in his favour The Romans had never before seen creatures of such magnitude they were terrified not only with their intrepid fierceness but with the castles which were built upon their backs filled with armed men they considered them rather as prodigies sent to destroy than as animals trained up to subdue them But not only the men but the horses shared in this general consternation neither enduring the smell nor the cries of these formidable creatures but throwing their riders they filled the ranks with confusion It was then that Pyrrhus saw the day was his own and sending in his Thessalian cavalry to charge the enemy in disorder the rout became general A dreadful sla  ghter of the Romans ensued fifteen thousand men being killed on the spot and eighteen hundred taken prisoners Nor were the conquerors much in a better state than the vanquished  Pyrrhus himself being wounded and thirteen thousand of his forces slain Night coming on put an end to the slaughter on both sides and Pyrrhus was heard to cry out that one such victory more would ruin his army The next day as he walked to view the field of battle he could not help regarding with admiration the bodies of the Romans which were slain upon seeing them all with their wounds before their countenances though even in death marked with noble resolution and a sternness that awed him into respect he was heard to cry out in the true spirit of a military adventurer  "O with what ease could I conquer the world had I the Romans for soldiers or had they me for their king"  The Romans were highly pleased with this politeness in an enemy but still more with his civil treatment and his courtesy to the prisoners he had taken complaisance to the captives was a degree of refinement the Romans were yet to learn from the Greeks but it was only sufficient to shew this brave people an improvement either in morals or war and they immediately set about imitation  The Romans though defeated were still unconquered they again began to use all necessary diligence to recruit their army and to oppose the conqueror who joined by the southern states of Italy was marching directly towards  Rome However he was still unwilling to drive them to an extremity and finding them making great preparations he considered that it was best treating with an enemy after having gained a victory over them he resolved therefore to send his friend Cineas the orator to negotiate and use all his arts to induce them to peace He had long reposed great confidence in the abilities and persuasive powers of this scholar of Demosthenes and often asserted that he had won more towns by the eloquence of Cineas than by his own arms The old crafty Grecian readily undertook the embassy and entering Rome began his negotiation by attempting to influence not only the senators but even their wives by presents which he said were sent them by his master This however was the age of Roman virtue the senators refused to accept these bounties which they considered as bribes to betray their country and the women were not behind their husbands in their noble disinterestedness They bade him give back to his master those allurements to treason adding that they would then only accept his offers when the senate had considered whether they should ac  pt his terms of peace Never was there a tim  n which all the military and patriotic virtues s  ne with greater lustre than now The senators  ing by a late law as has been related reduced their fortunes more nearly to a  level with those of the people began to seek distinction from virtue only and despised those riches which could not be encreased so as to place them at a distance from the vulgar Thus Cineas with all his art found the Romans impracticable either by bribery or private persuasion finding therefore these methods ineffectual he proceeded to his commission more publickly and was at his request introduced to the senate Here he began by extolling his master's courage and clemency his desire of patronizing the brave and his particular esteem for the Romans He proceeded to inculcate the blessings of peace and the fine opportunity the senate then had of restoring it He offered in his master's name to return all that had been lately taken in battle without ransom to give assistance to the Romans on any future occasion and all that was asked in return was their alliance and friendship together with permission to have the Tarentines included in the treaty These offers and still more the orator's eloquence appeared to touch the whole assembly a general inclination seemed to prevail in favour of the king's proposal and a peace was confidently talked of in every part of the city In this juncture Appius Claudius an old senator who was now grown blind with age and had long discontinued public business caused himself to be carried into the house in a  litter The surprize of seeing him in the senate again and numberless infirmities which he appeared to surmount in coming awed the whole assembly into silence and attention  "I have l  ng" cried he raising himself from his couch "considered my blindness and my infirmities as evils thought that heaven had been willing to punish my old age for the faults I had committed when young and had repaid a youth of folly with an age of pain but now conscript fathers I find that I have been peculiarly indulged in what I considered as calamities since my loss of sight has hindered me from seeing the late dishonour of my country Nay might I make a wish it should be for deafness also and then I should no longer hear of what must now excite indignation in the breast of every virtuous Roman How different are you now from what you were some years ago Alexander whom the world has called Great was then thought nothing of in Rome we then universally ascribed his conquests not to his valour but his fortune You then wished that the tide of war might have brought him into Italy only to shew the world your own superior prowess But how are you fallen at present You then wished to combat with the conqueror of Greece and now you fear to engage one of those  states which he actually conquered You desired to cope with Alexander and yet you refuse to meet one who has left his native country rather through a fear of his ancient enemies than a desire of finding new We have therefore but this alternative either boldly to meet Pyrrhus in the field or to be content to suffer all the contempt the neighbouring states of Italy shall throw upon us and thus by endeavouring to avoid one war engage ourselves in an hundred"  This speech was received with universal approbation the assembly grew warm in the praises of their rough old orator and the smooth orations of Cineas were heard no more Being therefore unable to make any progress in his embassy he was dismissed with an answer intimating that when Pyrrhus should withdraw his forces from Italy that then the Senate would treat with him concerning peace  Cineas being thus frustrated in his expectations returned to his master extolling both the virtues and the grandeur of the Romans The senate he said appeared a reverend assembly of demigods and the city a temple for their reception Of this Pyrrhus soon after became sensible by an embassy from Rome concerning the ransom and exchange of prisoners At the head of this venerable deputation was Fabricius an ancient senator who had long  been a pattern to his countrymen of the most extreme poverty joined with the most chearful content This practical philopher who had been formerly consul and was now the ambassador of Rome had no other plate furniture in his house except a small cup the bottom even of which was of horn His daughters being without fortunes the senate generously portioned them from the public treasury When the Samnites had formerly offered him large presents he refused them saying that he was already rich as he had learned the art of lessening his wants by retrenching his appetites Pyrrhus received this celebrated old man with great kindness and willing to try how far fame had been just in his favour offered him rich presents which however the Roman refused the day after he was desirous of examining the equality of his temper and ordered one of his elephants to be placed behind the tapestry which upon a signal given raised its trunk above the ambassador's head at the same time using other arts to intimidate him Fabricius however with a countenance no way changing smile▪ upon the king observing that he looked wit  an equal eye on the terrors of this day as h  had upon the aliurements of the preceding  Pyrrhus pleased to find so much virtue in on  he had considered as a barbarian was willin  to grant him the only favour which he kne  could make him happy He released the Roman prisoners intrusting them to Fabricius alone upon his promise that in case the senate were determined to continue the war he might reclaim them whenever he thought proper  By this time the Roman army was recovered  from its late defeat and Sulpicius and Decius the consuls for the following year were placed at its head The panic which had formerly seized it from the elephants now began to wear off and the generals with great assiduity applied themselves to imitate the discipline of Pyrrhus and the Grecian method of encampment It was in this manner they always adopted the improvements of other nations and learned by defeat the power of becoming invincible Both armies met near the city Asculum both pretty nearly equal in numbers being about forty thousand strong Pyrrhus found himself incommoded by a woody country that prevented his phalanx and elephants from being so serviceable as in the plain he therefore continued for some time rather upon the defensive until night should give him time to make a more advantageous disposition The next morning he caused a detachment of his cavalry to possess themselves of the upper grounds and thus force the enemy into the plain which when they had successfully effected he brought down his elephants into the thickest of the  fight and mixing his slingers and archer  among them formed a body that the Romans were scarce able to resist besides not having the advantages of advancing and retreating as the day before the battle became close and general The Roman legions at first were unable to pierce the Greek phalanx but at length careless of their own lives they made a desperate slaughter among them In fine after a long and obstinate fight the Grecian discipline prevailed and the Romans being pressed on every side particularly by the elephants were obliged to retire to their camp leaving six thousand men dead upon the field of battle But the enemy had no great reason to boast of their triumph as they had four thousand slain so that Pyrrhus replied to one of his soldiers who was congratulating him upon his victory  "one such triumph more and I shall be undone"  Nor was he unjust in the assertion as by this time the greatest part of those forces which had followed him from home were destroyed and his friends and generals were mostly cut off  This battle finishing the campaign the next season began with equal vigour on both sides Pyrrhus having received new succours from home while old Fabricius who was made consul with Aemilius led on the Romans no way discouraged by their former defeat While  the two armies were approaching and yet but a small distance from each other a letter was brought to Frabricius from the king's physician importing that for a proper reward he would take him off by poison and thus rid the Romans of a powerful enemy and a dangerous war Fabricius felt all the honest indignation at this base proposal that was consonant with his former character he communicated it to his colleague and instantly gave it as his opinion that Pyrrhus should be informed of the treachery that was plotted against him Accordingly letters were dispatched for that purpose informing Pyrrhus of his unfortunate choice of friends and enemies That he had trusted and promoted villains while he carried his resentment against the generous and the and the brave Pyrrhus now began to find that these bold barbarians were by degrees schooling into refinement and would not suffer him to be their superior even in generosity he received the message with equal amazement at their candour and indignation at his physician's treachery  "Admirable Fabricius cried he it would be as easy to turn the sun from its course as thee from the paths of honour"  Then making the proper enquiry among his servants and having discovered the treason he ordered his physician to be executed However not to be outdone in magnanimity he immediately  sent to Rome all his prisoners without ransom and again desired to negotiate a peace The Romans on the other hand refused him peace but upon the same conditions as they had offered before and released as many of the Samnites and Tarentines as equalled the number of the prisoners they had received The king was a good deal astonished at the Roman obstinacy he appeared divided between shame and necessity his circumstances obliging him in some measure to discontinue the war while his honour was hurt in being compelled to leave it unfinished However an invitation from the Sicilians begging relief against the Carthaginians who had possessed their island and treated them cruelly relieved him from his embarrassment This expedition promissed more rewards and less labour and such were the chief objects of this military rambler's attention He therefore placed a garrison in Tarentum much against the inclination of the inhabitants and then sending his friend Cineas before him followed with all the rest of his forces to relieve Sicily  In the mean time the Samnites and Tarentines being left to the mercy of the Romans continued to sollicit him with the most earnest supplications to return to protect them Pyrrhus whom his successes in Sicily had for some time made deaf to their entreaties was after a lapse of two years spent in ineffectual victory  glad to have a specious pretext to leave this country also as he had formerly left Italy He therefore with some difficulty once more returned to Tarentum at the head of twenty thousand foot and three thousand horse The Romans though pressed by so formidable a power as that of Pyrrhus had not yet forgotten the ancient animosity between the orders of the state and upon a levy being set forward to form an army to oppose him several of the people refused to enlist In order to repress a sedition which threatened nothing less than the destruction of the empire▪ the consuls resolved to act with spirit and accordingly commanded that the names of the citizens should be drawn by lot and that he who first refused to take the field should be sold as a slave This timely severity had its effect and whenever after any man refused to enlist when called upon he was instantly treated by the consuls in that manner Having thus raised a sufficient body of forces the consuls divided their army into two parts▪ and marched into the enemies country one into Lucania and the other among the Samnites Pyrrhus having encreased his his army also by new levies and being informed of this divided his forces also and sent one part to oppose the march of Lentulus while he himself went to attack Curius Dentatus before his colleague could come up His principal  aim was to surprize the enemy by night but unfortunately passing through woods and his lights failing him his men lost their way so that at the approach of morning they saw themseves in sight of the Roman camp with the enemy drawn out ready to receive them The vanguard of both armies soon met in which the Romans had the advantage Soon after a general engagement ensuing Pyrrhus finding the ballance of the victory turning still against him had once more recourse to his elephants These however the Romans were now too well acquainted with to feel any vain terrors from and having found that fire was the most effectual means to repel them they caused numbers of balls to be made composed of flax and rosin which were thrown against them as they approached the ranks The elephants thus rendered furious by the flame and as boldly opposed by the soldiers could no longer be brought on but ran back on their own army bearing down their ranks and filling all places with terror and confusion Thus victory at length declared in favour of Rome Phrrhus in vain attempted to stop the flight and the slaughter of his troops he lost not only twentythree thousand of his best soldiers but his camp was also taken This served as a new lesson to the Romans who were ever open to improvement they had formerly pitched  their tents without order but by this they were taught to measure out their ground and fortify the whole with a trench so that many of their succeeding victories may be ascribed to their improved method of encamping  In the mean time while the two consuls were entering triumphant into Rome Pyrrhus bore his defeat with unbroken courage his first care was to secure a retreat and then to keep up the spirits of his ailies with promises of better success for the future This he old till he had tried the utmost of what his interest could do to furnish out another campaign However finding all hopes of that fruitless he resolved to leave Italy where he had found only desperate enemies and faithless allies Accordingly calling together the Tarentines he informed them that he had received assurances from Greece of speedy assistance and desiring them to expect the event with tranquillity the night following he embarked his troops and returned undisturbed into his native kingdom with the remains of his shattered forces first leaving a garrison in Tarentum merely to save appearances In this manner ended the war with Pyrrhus after six years continuance Thro' the whole of this we find the Romans acting a nobler part than in any former period endeavouring to join the politeness of Greece to the virtuous austerity of their own manners  A spirit of frugality contempt of wealth and virtuous emulation had spread itself over the whole senate Fabricius not only brought poverty into fashion by his example but punished all approaches to luxury by his authority as a magistrate About this time in the censorship of Fabricius Ruffinus who had been twice a consul and once a dictator was turned out of the senate and had a mark of infamy put upon his name for no other offence than being possessed of ten pound of silver plate for the use of his table By this love of temperance and these successes in war though the individuals were poor the public was rich the number of citizens also was encreased to above two hundred thousand men capable of bearing arms and the fame of the Roman name was so far extended that Ptolomy Philadelphus king of Egypt sent ambassadors to congratulate their success and to entreat their alliance As for the poor luxurious Tarentines who were the original promoters of this war they soon began to find a worse enemy in the garrison that was left for their defence than in the Romans who attacked them from without The hatred between them and Milo who commanded their citadel for Pyrrhus was become so great that nothing but the fear of their old inveterate enemies the Romans could equal it In this distress they applied to the Carthaginians  who with a large fleet came and blocked up the port of Tarentum so that this unfortunate people who once were famous through Italy for their refinements and pleasures now saw themselves contended for by three different armies while they were not even left the choice of a conqueror At length however the Romans found means to bring over the garrison to their interest after which they easily became masters of the city and demolished its walls granting the inhabitants liberty and protection  CHAP XV From the beginning of the first Punic war to the beginning of the second when the Romans began to grow powerful by sea  THE Romans had now destroyed all rival  pretensions in Italy the Tarentines the Samnites the Lucanians were now no more or patiently took laws from the conquerors Their victory over Pyrrhus not only gave them reputation abroad but kindled an ambition for foreign conquest They began also to know though not to practise the refinements of the Greeks and Tarentines whom they had conquered the number of their husbandmen diminished  while as in all states becoming opulent their artizans and gentry continually encreased The environs of the city were now therefore no longer able to furnish their growing numbers with corn and supplies were brought from the kingdoms abroad Of these Sicily sent by far the greatest proportion so that the people began secretly to wish for the possession of a country which had for some time served as the granary of Rome To minds predisposed for conquest a pretext to begin is seldom wanting The Carthaginians were at that time in possession of the greatest part of Sicily and like the Romans only wanted an opportunity of embroiling the natives in order to become masters of the whole island This opportunity had now offered Hiero king of Syracuse one of the states of the Island as yet unconquered entreated their aid against the Mamertines a little people of the same country and they sent him supplies both by land and sea The Mamertines on the other hand to shield off impending ruin put themselves under the protection of Rome The Romans however not thinking the Mamertines worthy of the name of allies instead of professing to assist them boldly declared war against Carthage alledging as a reason the assistance which Carthage had lately lent to the southern parts of Italy against the Romans In this manner a  war was declared between these two powerful states who were both grown too great to continue patient spectators of each others encrease  Carthage a colony of the Phaenicians was built on the coast of Africa near the place where Tunis now stands about an hundred and thirtyseven years before the foundation of Rome As it had been long growing into power so it had extended its dominions all along the coasts and was in possession also of many of the principal Islands in the Mediterranean sea But its chief strength lay in its fleets and commerce by these its riches were become immense and by their money alone they were capable of hiring and sending forth armies to conquer or to keep their neighbours under subjection However as they had now been long in possession of affluence the state began to feel the evils that wealth is too apt to produce for as at Rome public employments were made the reward of virtue only and superior honour only raised to a preference of toils so in Carthage the several offices which the state had to bestow were venal and those who purchased them only aimed at being reimbursed by all the sordid arts of peculation Thus unequally matched these two great powers began what was called the first Punic war the Carthaginians possessed of gold and silver which might be exhausted the Romans of perseverance patriotism  and poverty which seemed to gather strength by every defeat  As the Romans had been hitherto shut up in their own dominions they had but little knowledge of the method of transporting an army by sea Appius Claudius was the first who by means of a feeble fleet or as some will have it a raft of timber carried over a small body of forces into Sicily where victory as usual was still attendant upon the fortune of Rome A league made with Hiero king of Syracuse soon after the consul's arrival began to inspire the Romans with hopes of expelling the Carthaginians from the Island and becoming masters of it in their turn But still there seemed an unsurmountable obstacle to their ambitious views they had no fleet or at least what deserved that title while the Carthaginians being masters of a very powerful one had the entire command at sea and kept all the maritime towns under their obedience In such a situation any people but the Romans would have rested contented under disadvantages which nature seemed to have imposed but nothing could conquer or intimidate them They began to apply themselves to maritime affairs and though without shipwrights to build or seamen to navigate a fleet yet they resolved to surmount every obstacle with inflexible perseverance A Carthaginian vessel happened to be  in a storm driven ashore and this was sufficient to give the Romans hopes of building vessels that might one day control the long established naval power of the Carthaginians Accordingly they diligently set about imitating this ship which was in itself little better than a wreck building an hundred and twenty more according to the model before them But now although they had something like a fleet which though clumsy and ill adapted for sailing was of some force they still wanted sailors to manage it As for the Romans themselves being bred up to husbandry they were perfectly ignorant of maritime affairs and the neighbouring states whom they had lately conquered were either unwilling to embark or not to be relied on In this exigence they taught their men to row upon land instructing them in the naval manner of engaging as well as they could leaving it to their native valour to do the rest The consul Duillius was the first who ventured to sea with this new constructed armament but he soon however found that the enemy was every way superior in point of sailing and bringing on their vessels to an engagement But the indefatigable spirit of the Romans was not to be subdued he found out a remedy even here by inventing an instrument which upon an impulse of two ships kept them both grappled together so  that neither could separate until courage had decided the victory By this a naval engagement became more like one at land so that when the two rival fleets met the Romans had the victory the Carthaginians losing fifty of their ships and the undisturbed sovereignty of the sea which they valued more These successes were so unexpected by the senate that Duillius their admiral obtained a signal triumph with orders that whenever he went out to supper there should be a band of music to attend him  In the mean time the contest was carried on by land in Sicily with various success the Romans as well as their enemies having sometimes the worst of the campaign But the conduct of both nations during the continuance of this war was manifestly different The Carthaginians appeared always murmuring against their generals and admirals and sometimes punished them with death for want of success The Romans went on still contented and persevering and seemingly as easy under a defeat as happy when victorious Their chief successes during the latter part of the war in Sicily were owing to the conduct and courage of their consul Regulus who subdued the islands Lippara and that of Melita so celebrated at this day for being the residence of the knights of Malta The city of Agrigentum in Sicily  and of Alberia in Corsica were also attached to the conquests of Rome  But these trifling successes were by no means sufficient to gratify the sanguine expectations of the people for though the Carthaginians were sometimes defeated even at sea yet they still continued most powerful there and sent in supplies to the island at pleasure The conquest therefore of Sicily was only to be obtained by humbling the power of Carthage at home For this reason the senate resolved to carry the war into Africa itself and accordingly they sent Regulus and Manlius with a fleet of three hundred sail to make the invasion Regulus was reckoned the most consummate warrior that Rome could then produce he was a professed example of frugal severity but less austere to others than to himself he only reprehended those faults which he would have died rather than have committed his patriotism was still greater than his temperance all the private passions seemed extinguished in him or they were all swallowed up in one great ruling affection the love of his country The two generals set sail with their fleet which was the greatest that had ever yet left an Italian port carrying an hundred and forty thousand men They were met by the Carthaginians with a fleet as powerful and men better used to the sea While the fight continued rather between the ships than the  men at a distance the Carthaginians seemed successful but when the Romans came to grapple with them the difference between a mercenary army and one that fought for fame was apparent The resolution of the Romans was crowned with success the enemies fleet were dispersed and fiftyfour of their vessels taken The consequence of this victory was an immediate descent upon the coasts of Africa and the capture of the city Clupea together with twenty thousand men who were made prisoners of war  The senate being informed of these great successes and applied to for fresh instructions▪ commanded Manlius back to Italy in orde  to superintend the Sicilian war and directed that Regulus should continue in Africa to prosecute his victories there but as his consulship was expiring they continued him their general under the title of Proconsul Happy in the approbation of his country Regulu  continued his successes and led his forces along the banks of the river Bagrada Here whil  he was waiting for the approach of the Carthaginians a serpent of enormous size attacke  his men as they went for water and seemed a  if resolved to guard the banks of the river I  was an hundred and twenty feet long wit  scales impenetrable to any weapon Some o  the boldest troops at first went up to oppose it  fury but they soon fell victims to their rashness being either killed by its devouring jaws or crushed to pieces by the windings of its tail The poisonous vapour that issued from it made it still more formidable and the men were so much terrified at its appearance that they asserted they would much more joyfully have faced the whole Carthaginian army For some time it seemed uncertain which should remain masters of the river as from the hardness of its scales no ordinary efforts could drive it away At last Regulus was obliged to make use of the machines employed in battering down the walls of cities Notwithstanding the serpent for a long time withstood all his efforts and destroyed numbers of his men but at length a very large stone which was flung from an engine happened to break its spine and destroyed its motion by these means the soldiers surrounded and killed it Regulus not less pleased with his victory than if he had gained a battle ordered its skin to be sent to Rome where it continued to be seen till the times of Pliny  Mean while the Carthaginians finding the Romans proceeding towards their very capital brought out a considerable army to oppose them A battle ensued in which Carthage was once more defeated and some of its best troops were cut off This fresh victory contributed to throw them into the utmost despair more  than eighty of their towns submitted to the Romans The Numidians their ancient allies rose against them at the same time and combined to ravage the country The peasants who fled on every side flocked into Carthage as to the only place of refuge and brought with them only misery and famine In this distress the Carthaginians destitute of generals at home who had abilities to oppose the conqueror were obliged to send to Lacedemon offering the command of their armies to Xantippus a commander of great experience who undertook to conduct them They at the same time dispatched some of the principal men of the state to Regulus to beg a peace The Roman general had long wished to terminate the war and go back to his native country He had even sent to the senate some time before demanding a successor and leave to return in consequence of an account he had received informing him that his steward who cultivated his estate which consisted but of seven acres was dead and that his servant had stolen all the instruments of husbandry that were used in its cultivation He informed the senate that while he was leading on the armies of the state his wife and children were in danger of wanting bread and that his little domestic affairs required his presence at home The senate upon this ordered a sufficient maintenance for his  wife and children furnished his estate with proper instruments of husbandry at the public expence and gave him orders to continue at the head of the army When the Carthaginians therefore sent proposals of peace he was very much inclined to come to treaty but in some measure considering himself as master of Carthage he thought it was his duty to dictate the terms These were that Carthage should give up all the cities they were possessed of in Sicily and Sardinia that they should deliver up all their prisoners without reward and at the same time ransom those that were made of their own These and some other conditions of the same nature were offered but the Carthaginians thinking them too rigid the treaty broke off and both sides prepared for war  Xantippus the Lacedemonian general was arrived by this time and gave the magistrates proper instructions for levying their men he assured them that their armies were hitherto overthrown not by the strength of the enemy but the ignorance of their own generals he therefore only required a ready obedience to his orders and assured them of an easy victory The whole city seemed once more revived from despondence by the exhortations of a single stranger and soon from hope grew into confidence This was the spirit the Grecian general wished to excite in them so that when he  saw them thus ripe for the engagement he joyfully took the field The forces on both sides were but few the Carthaginian army consisting only of twelve thousand foot and four thousand horse those of the Romans of about the same or rather a superior number The first circumstance which alarmed Regulus was to find the enemy alter their plan of encampment and make a new choice of their ground They had hitherto chosen the most woody and unequal places where their cavalry were embarrassed and their elephants utterly unserviceable They now continually kept in the open country and so harrassed the Roman army that at length Regulus was obliged to descend into the plain and cross the river to give them battle The Lacedemonian made the most skillful disposition of his forces he placed his cavalry in the wings he disposed the elephants at proper intervals behind the line of heavyarmed infantry and bringing up the lightarmed troops before he ordered them to retire through the line of infantry after they had discharged their weapons This was a most masterly disposition and such as was useful to the Romans in succeeding engagements though it was fatal to them in this For now both armies engaging after a long and obstinate resistance the Romans were overthrown with dreadful slaughter the greatest part of their army  being destroyed and Regulus himself taken prisoner A victory so great and unexpected filled the streets of Carthage with ungovernable joy they could never sufficiently satisfy themselves with gazing on the conqueror though he was but small of stature and of a very mean appearance But this disposition was but of short continuance for soon their admiration was turned into envy They could not bear to owe to a stranger that safety which they wanted abilities and virtue to procure for themselves Xantippus however who knew their malignity and who never much prided himself upon their barbarous praise was desirous of lessening their malevolence by removing the cause he therefore requested permission to return home and desired a ship for that purpose Their ingratitude on this occasion if historians say true was even more shocking than their former antipathy for pretending to furnish him with the most honourable conveyance the mariners had private orders to throw him and his companions overboard lest the honour of obtainnig so great a victory should be taken from them to be ascribed to a stranger  However this may be the affairs of the Carthaginians for some time went on to improve while those of Rome seemed to be declining The remains of the Roman army were besieged in Clupea a city on the coasts of Africa which Regulus had taken and though it was for a  while relieved by means of a naval victory under the conduct of Aemilius Paulus yet they were obliged to evacuate the place Soon after the Romans lost their whole fleet in a storm and Agrigentum their principal town in Sicily was taken by Karthalo the Carthaginian general The Romans not easily to be deterred undertook to build a new fleet which also shared the fate of the former the mariners as yet unacquainted with the Mediterranean shores drove it upon quicksands and soon after the greatest part perished in a storm Thus distressed in every naval attempt they for a while gave up all hopes of rivalling the Carthaginians at sea and placed all their hopes in the conquest of Sicily which they in a great measure effected Mean time the Carthaginians being now more successful than when they had formerly made proposals of peace were desirous of a new treaty hoping to have better terms than those insisted upon before They therefore resolved to send to Rome to negotiate this business or at least to procure an exchange of prisoners For this purpose they supposed that Regulus whom they had now for four years kept in a dungeon confined and chained would be a proper sollicitor It was expected that being wearied with imprisonment and bondage he would gladly endeavour to persuade his countrymen to a discontinuance of the war which only prolonged  his captivity He was accordingly sent with their ambassadors to Rome but with a promise previously exacted from him to return in case of being unsuccessful He was even given to understand that his life depended upon the success of the expedition  When this old general together with the ambassadors of Carthage approached Rome numbers of his friends came out to meet and congratulate his return Their acclamations resounded through the city but Regulus refused with settled melancholy to enter the gates It was in vain that he was entreated on every side to visit once more his little dwelling and share in that joy which his return had inspired He persisted in saying that he was now but a slave belonging to the Carthaginians and unfit to partake in the liberal honours of his country The senate assembling without the walls as usual to give audience to the enemies ambassadors Regulus opened his commission as he had been directed by the Carthaginian council and their ambassadors seconded his proposals The senate were by this time themselves weary of a war which had been protracted above eight years and were no way disinclinable to a peace It seemed the general opinion that the enmity between the two states had continued too long and that no terms should be refused which would not only give rest to the two nations but liberty to an  old general whom the people reverenced and loved It only remained for Regulus himself to give his opinion who when it came to his turn to speak to the surprize of all the world gave his voice for continuing the war He assured the senate that the Carthaginian resources were now almost exhausted their populace harrassed out with fatigues and their nobles with contention that all their best generals were prisoners with the Romans while Carthage had none but the refuse of the Roman army that not only the interest of Rome but its honour also was concerned in continuing the war for their ancestors had never made peace till they were victorious So unexpected an advice not a little disturbed the senate they saw the justice of his opinion but they also saw the dangers he incurred by giving it they seemed entirely satisfied of the expediency of prolonging the war their only obstacle was how to secure the safety of him who had advised its continuance they pitied as well as admired a man who had used such eloquence against his private interest and could not conclude upon a measure which was to terminate in his ruin Regulus however soon relieved their embarrasment by breaking off the treaty and rising in order to return to his bonds and confinement It was in vain that the senate and all his dearest friends entreated his stay he still repressed their  solicitations Maria his wife with her little children filled the city with her lamentations and vainly entreated to be permitted to see him he still obstinately persisted in keeping his promise and though he was sufficiently apprized of the tortures that awaited his return without embracing his family or taking leave of his friends he departed with the ambassadors for Carthage Nothing could equal the fury and the disappointment of the Carthaginians when they were informed by their ambassadors of Regulus instead of hastening a peace having given his opinion for continuing the war First his eyelids were cut off and then he was remanded to prison He was after some days brought out and exposed with his face opposite the burning sun At last when malice was fatigued with studying all the arts of torture he was put into a barrel stuck full of nails that pointed inwards and in this painful position he continued till he died  Both sides now took up arms with more than former animosity The Romans who were inflexible in their purposes although they had so many times been wrecked at sea and had lost such numbers of their bravest troops there once more fitted out a fleet and again bid defiance to Carthage It seemed however as if fortune was resolved to drive them from this unstable element for by the bad conduct  of Claudius Pulcher their consul and by other various disasters their fleet was destroyed like all the former and the Romans seemed drained of every resource to furnish out a new one In consequence of this they were obliged to abstain for seven years from all naval preparations But their spirit was not to be broken they yet again resolved to build another fleet and to try their wayward fortune in forming a naval power At length their perseverance was crowned with success one victory followed on the back of another Fabius Buteo the consul shewed them the way by defeating a large squadron of the enemies ships but Lutatius Catulus gained a victory still more complete in which the power of Carthage seemed totally destroyed at sea by the loss of an hundred and twenty ships according to the smallest computation This loss brought them to sue for peace which Rome thought proper to grant but still inflexible in its demands exacted the same conditions which Regulus had formerly offered at the gates of Carthage These were that the Carthaginians should lay down a thousand talents of silver to defray the charge of the war and should pay two thousand two hundred more in ten years time that they should quit Sicily with all such islands as they possessed near it that they should never make war against the allies of Rome or come with any vessels  of war within the Roman dominions and lastly that all their prisoners and deserters should be delivered up without ransom to these hard conditions the Carthaginians now exhausted readily subscribed and thus ended the first Punic war which had lasted twentyfour  years and in some measure had drained both nations of every resource to begin anew  CHAP XVI From the end of the first Punic war to the end of the second  THE war being ended between the Carthaginians and Romans a profound peace ensued and in about six years after the temple of Janus was shut for the second time since the foundation of the city Rome being thus in friendship with all nations had an opportunity of turning to the arts of peace they now began to have a relish for poetry the first liberal art which rises in every civilized nation and the first also that decays Hitherto they had been entertained only with the rude drolleries of their lowest buffoons they had sports called Fescennini in which a few debauched actors made their own parts while raillery and smut supplied the  place of humour To these a composition of a higher kind succeeded which they called satire which was a kind of dramatic poem in which the characters of the great were particularly pointed out and made an object of derision to the vulgar After these came tragedy and comedy which were borrowed from the Greeks and indeed the first dramatic poet of Rome whose  name was Livius Andronicus was by birth a Grecian The instant these finer kinds of composition appeared this great people rejected their former impurities with disdain From thenceforward they laboured upon the Grecian model and though they were never able to rival their masters in dramatic composition they soon surpassed them in many of the more soothing kinds of poetry Elegaic pastoral and didactic compositions began to assume new beauties in the Roman language and satire not that rude kind of dialogue already ment oned but a nobler sort invented by Lucillius was all their own  While they were thus admitting the arts of peace they were not unmindful of making fresh preparations for war all intervals of ease seemed rather to give fresh vigour for new designs than to relax their former intrepidity The Illyrians were the first people upon whom they tried their strength after some continuance of  peace That nation which had long plundered  the merchants of the Mediterranean with impunity happened to make deprad  ions upon some of the trading subjects of Rome This being complained of to Teuta the queen of the country she instead of granting redress ordered the ambassador that was sent to demand restitution to be murdered A war ensued in which the Romans were victorious Most of the Illyric towns were surrendered to the consuls and a peace at last concluded by which the greatest part of the country was ceded to Rome a yearly tribute exacted for the rest and a prohibition added that the Illyrians should not sail beyond the river Lissus with more than two barks and those unarmed  The Gauls were the next people that incurred the displeasure of the Romans Supposing a time of peace when the armies were disbanded a proper season for new irruptions this barbarous people inviting fresh forces from beyond the Alps and entering Etruria wasted all with fire and sword till they came within about three days journey of Rome A praetor and a consul were sent to oppose them who now instructed in the improved arts of war were enabled to surround the Gauls who still retained their primaeval barbarity It was in vain that those hardy troops who had nothing but their courage to protect them formed two fronts to oppose their adversaries their naked bodies and  undisciplined forces were unable to withstand the shock of an enemy completely armed and skilled in military evolutions A miserable slaughter ensued in which forty thousand were killed and ten thousand taken prisoners This victory was followed by another gained over them by Marcellus in which he killed Viridomarus their king with his own hand and gained the third royal spoils that were yet obtained at Rome These conquests forced them to beg a peace the conditions of which served greatly to enlarge the empire Thus the Romans went on with success they had now totally recovered their former losses and only wanted an enemy worthy of their arms to begin a new war  An occasion soon offered to renew their military aims The Carthaginians who only made a peace because they were no longer able to continue the war took the earliest opportunity of breaking the treaty they besieged Saguntum a city of Spain which had been in alliance with Rome and though desired to desist prosecuted their operations with vigour Ambassadors were sent in consequence from Rome to Carthage complaining of the infraction of their articles and requiring that Hannibal the Carthaginian general who had advised this measure should be delivered up This demand being refused the ambassadors began to perceive  their inclinations for a rupture and holding out the skirt of his robe as was the custom told the Carthaginian ministry that he brought them peace or war of which they might chuse They desired him to deliver which he thought proper to which he returned  "Then let it be war"  and thus leaving the assembly returned to Rome  War being thus again declared between these  great rival powers the Carthaginians trusted the management of it on their side to Hannibal the son of Amilcar their former general Hannibal had been made the sworn foe of Rome almost from his infancy for while yet very young his father brought him before the altar and obliged him to take an oath never to be in friendship with the Romans nor desist from opposing their power until he or they should be no more On his first appearance in the field he reconciled in his own person the most just method of commanding with the most perfect obedience to his superiors Thus he was equally beloved by his generals and the troops he was appointed to lead He was possest of the greatest courage in opposing danger and the greatest presence of mind in retiring from it No fatigue was able to subdue his body or break his spirit equally patient of heat and cold he only took sustenance to content nature and not to delight his  appetite His seasons for repose or labour were never marked but he was ever ready when difficulties or his country demanded his aid He was frequently found stretched on the ground among his centinels covered only with a watchcoat His dress differed in nothing from the most ordinary man of his army except that he affected peculiar elegance in his horses and armour He was the best horseman and the swiftest runner of his time He was ever the foremost to engage and the last to retreat he was ever prudent in his designs which were extensive and ever fertile in expedients to perplex his enemies or to rescue himself from hardships He was experienced sagacious provident and bold Such were the admirable qualities of this inimitable soldier who is generally allowed the greatest general of all antiquity but on the other hand he was cruel and faithless without honour without religion and yet so deceitful as to assume the appearance of them all yet after all we must remember that it is his enemies who gave him this character From such a soldier and politician the Carthaginians formed the greatest expectations and his taking Saguntum shortly after confirmed them in their opinion of his abilities But he soon gave proofs of a much more extensive genius than they could have conceived for having overrun all Spain and levied a large army of various  languages and nations he resolved to carry the war into Italy as the Romans had before carried it into the dominions of Carthage For this purpose leaving Hanno with a sufficient force to guard his conquests in Spain he crossed the Pyrenean mountains into Gaul with an army of fifty thousand foot and nine thousand horse He quickly traversed that country which was then wild extensive and filled with inimical nations In vain its forests and rivers appeared to intimidate him the Rhone with its rapid current and its banks covered with enemies or the Dura branched out into numberless channels opposed his way he passed them all with perseverance and in ten days arrived at the foot of the Alps over which he was to explore a new passage into Italy It was now in the midst of winter when this astonishing project was undertaken the season added new horrors to a scene that nature had already crowded with objects of dismay The prodigious height and tremendous steepness of the mountains capped with snow the rude cottages that seemed to hang upon the sides of the precipices the cattle and even the wild beasts themselves stiff with cold or desperate with famine the people barbarous and fierce dressed in skins with long shaggy hair presented a picture that impressed the beholders with astonishment and terror But nothing was capable of subduing the  courage of the Carthaginian general after having harrangued his army he undertook to lead them up the sides of the mountain assuring his soldiers that they were now scaling not the walls of Italy but of Rome  The soldiers in this march had not vain fears alone to combat with but numberless and unforeseen calamities The intenseness of the cold the height of the precipices the smoothness of the ice but above all the opposition of the inhabitants who assailed them from above and rolled down huge rocks upon them in their march all contributed to dispirit the army At length after nine days painful march through these untrodden paths Hannibal gained the top of the mountains where he rejoiced his soldiers by shewing them the charming and fertile vales of Italy which were stretched out beneath After two days respite he next prepared to descend and this was found a work of more danger even than the former Prodigious quantities of snow having lately f  llen as many were swallowed up in that as had before been destroyed by the enemy Every new advance seemed but to encrease the danger▪ till at last he came to the verge of a precipice above three hundred yards perpendicular which seemed utterly unpassable It was then that despair appeared in every face but Hannibal's but he still remained unshaken his first  effort was to endeavour by taking a circuit to find a more commodious passage but finding this only encrease his difficulty he resolved to undertake levelling the rock For this purpose great numbers of large trees were felled and a mighty pile made against it and set on fire The rock being thus heated says Livy was softened by vinegar and a passage opened through which the whole army might safely pass This seemed to be the end of the difficulties of this march for as he descended the vallies between the mountains became more fertile so that the cattle found pasture and the soldiers had time to repose Thus at the end of fifteen days spent in crossing the Alps Hannibal found himself in the plains of Italy with about half his army remaining the rest having died or being cut off in their march  As soon as it was known at Rome tha  Hannibal at the head of an immense army was crossing the Alps in order to invade their dominions the senate sent Scipio to oppose him as a general on whom they placed great dependence Scipio being desirous of making his principal effort while Hannibal's army was not yet recovered from the fatigues of their march brought up his forces and attacked him near Ticinium The engagement was for some time doubtful but a party of Numidian horse wheeling round attacked the Romans in  the rear and at last obliged them to retreat with considerable loss The consul was wounded in the beginning of the fight and would have fallen into the hands of the enemy had not his son Scipio afterwards called Africanus opposed himself to the snock of the engagement and saved his father's life at the hazard of his own Hannibal being thus victorious took the most prudent precautions to encrease his army giving orders to Mago his general of the cavalry that when he ravaged the country round always to spare the possessions of the Gauls while his depredations were permitted upon those of Rome This so pleased that simple people that they declared for him in great numbers and flocked to his standard with alacrity  Soon after this defeat Sempronius the other consul was resolved to repair the injury sustained by his colleague and seeing the continual defection of the Gauls going off to encrease the strength of the Punic army he determined to give battle the first opportunity Hannibal was not long in delaying his expectations and both armies met upon the banks of the river Trebia The Carthaginian general being apprized of the Roman impetuosity of which be always availed himself in almost every engagement had sent off a body of a thousand horse each with a footsoldier behind him across the river  to ravage the enemies country and provoke them to engage The Romans quickly routed this force who seeming to be defeated took the river and were as eagerly pursued by the consul It was not however till his army was got upon the opposite bank that he perceived himself half conquered already his men being fatigued by wading up to the armpits and quite benumbed by the intense coldness of the water But it was now too late to retire for Hannibal came pouring down his forces fresh and vigorous so that the battle soon became general The courage of the Romans for a while withstood every disadvantage and kept the victory doubtful but they soon found themselves attacked also in the rear by a party of horse which the Carthaginian general had laid in ambush to be ready on this occasion At length a total rout ensued twentysix thousand of the Romans were either killed by the enemy or drowned in attempting to repass the river A body of ten thousand men were all that survived who finding themselves enclosed on every side broke desperately through the enemies ranks and fought retreating till they found shelter in the city of Placentia  The loss of these two battles only served to encrease the caution of Hannibal and the vigilance of Rome Preparations for the ensuing campaign were carried on with greater vigour  than before and the Carthaginian general finding himself in a condition to change the feat of the war resolved to approach Rome by marching into Etruria There were two ways for effecting his march thither one more tedious but secure the other which was shorter led through the marshes caused by the overflowing of the river Arno All the former fatigues of the Carthaginian army were nothing compared to their suffering  here They were forced to march three days and nights successively up to the knees in water without sleep or without rest the hoofs of the horses came off in their passage while the beasts of burthen that carried the baggage unable to support the fatigue were left dead in the mud Hannibal himself riding upon an elephant which was the only one left alive felt all the complicated distress of his own situation and that of his army His health had been impaired in the preceding spring and having then an inflammation in his eyes he by his present fatigues lost one of them entirely At last however he arrived upon dry ground where he was informed that Flamminius the consul was encamped near Aricia waiting the arrival of the other consul with reinforcements from Rome One of Hannibal's chief excellencies in war was the care he took to inform himself of the temper and disposition of the generals who opposed him and finding that Flamminius was rash and overbearing  swoln with his former successes and confident of the future he resolved to bring him to an engagement before his colleague could come up Seeming therefore to take no notice of his army that lay in the direct road towards Rome he left it on one side and marching onward as if to besiege the capital itself he ravaged the whole country round in a terrible manner with fire and sword Flamminius as was expected could not tamely bear to see an insulting enemy laying every thing waste before him but burned for the engagement It was in vain that he was advised by the Senate and all about him to use caution and not to let the enemies insults provoke him to an unequal combat He immediately ordered his troops to march his friends foreboding their future danger while the soldiers went rejoicing in the courage of their general and indulging their hopes rather than considering the reasons they had for hoping Hannibal was with his army at the time when Flamminius came out to engage him at the lake of Thrasimene near to which was a chain of mountains and between these and the lake a narrow passage leading to a valley that was embosomed in hills It was upon these hills that he disposed his best troops and it was into this valley that Flamminius led his men to attack him A disposition every way so favourable for the Carthaginians was also assisted by  accident for a mist rising from the lake kept the Romans from seeing their enemies while the army upon the mountains being above its influence saw the whole disposition of their opponents The fortune of the day was such as might be expected from the conduct of the two generals the Roman army was broken and slaughtered almost before they could perceive the enemy that destroyed them About fifteen thousand Romans fell in the valley and six thousand more were obliged to yield themselves prisoners of war In this general carnage the unfortunate Flamminius did all that courage could inspire to save his army whereever the enemy was most successful he flew with a chosen body of his attendants to repress them at last despairing of victory and unwilling to survive a defeat he flung himself alone into the midst of the enemy and was killed by a Gaulish horseman who struck him through the body with a blow of his lance Hannibal after the battle kept the Roman prisoners but civilly dismissed those of the Latins and willing to give the consul an honourable interment he sought his body amongst the heaps of slain but it could not be found  Upon the news of this defeat at Rome after the general consternation was allayed the senate upon mature deliberation resolved to elect a commander with absolute authority in whom they  might repose their last and greatest expectations Their choice fell upon Fabius Maximus a man of great courage but with a happy mixture of caution less enraptured with the glare of victory than the consciousness of deserving it This old commander thus invested with the supreme dignity set forward with what preparations he was able to make but with no intentions of fighting an enemy whom he knew more powerful than himself He had long before setting out laid a plan by which to proceed and to that he strictly adhered during all the ensuing campaigns He was apprized that the only way to humble the Carthaginians at such a distance from home was rather by harrassing them than by fighting For this purpose he always encamped upon the highest grounds inaccessible to the enemies cavalry Whenever they moved he moved watched their motions straightened their quarters and cut off their provisions It was in vain that Hannibal used every stratagem to bring him to a battle the cautious Roman thence surnamed Cunctator still kept aloof contented with seeing his enemy in some measure defeated by delay Hannibal now therefore perceiving that his adversaries had altered their plan of operations tried his usual arts to make Fabius appear despicable to his own army He sometimes therefore braved him in his camp he sometimes wasted  the country round him talked of his abilities with contempt and in all his excursions spared the possessions of Fabius while those of the other Romans were plundered without mercy These arts in some measure succeeded the Romans began to suspect their general either of cowardice or treachery and a slight action that ensued a little after gave strength to their suspicions For Hannibal designing to march for the convenience of forage to a place called Cassinum he was by a mistake of his guide conducted towards Cassilinum where he found himself in a close country hemmed in on every side However willing to draw all the advantages he was able from his situation he ordered his cavalry to pillage the country round which the Roman army that still kept him in view beheld from a neighbouring hill Hannibal knew that his depredations would excite them to a desire of revenge but it was in vain they cried out to their phlegmatic general to lead them down upon the enemy Fabius still kept his post contrary to all the entreaties of his men and even the expostulations of Minutius his master of the horse It was now therefore found that the prudent Roman began to practise Hannibal's own stratagems against himself he had now enclosed him among mountains where it was impossible to winter and yet from which it was almost impracticable to extricate  his army without imminent danger In this exigence nothing but one of those stratagems of war which fall to the lot of great abilities only to invent could save him Hannibal's amazing fertility in expedients suggested one at this time which was successful he ordered a number of small faggots and lighted torches to be tied to the horns of two thousand oxen that he had in his camp and that they should be driven towards the enemy These tossing their heads and running up the sides of the mountains seemed to fill the whole neighbouring forest with fire while the centinels that were placed to guard the approaches of the mountain seeing such a number of flames advancing towards their posts fled in consternation supposing the whole body of the enemy was in arms to overwhelm them By this stratagem Hannibal drew off his army and escaped through the defiles that led beneath the hills though with considerable damage to his rear Although Fabius had conducted himself in this expedition with all the prudence and conduct of the most consummate general he could not prevent the murmurs of his army who now began to tax his ignorance in war as they had formerly impeached his valour and fidelity  Fabius no way sollicitous to quiet the murmurs either of his army or of the citizens themselves returned to Rome in order to raise money  to ransom some Roman prisoners whom Hannibal offered to release but in the mean time he gave his instructions to Minucius his master of the horse to abstain from giving the enemy battle upon any occasion whatsoever Minucius however who now began to have the same opinion of the dictator that the rest of the soldiers entertained of him little regarded his instructions but venturing out against the Carthaginians skirmished with such success that by universal consent was made equal in power to the dictator and both generals were appointed to command each his own part of the army Being thus possessed of equal power Minucius began by altering the former conduct of Fabius From keeping on the tops of the mountains he now drew down his part of the army into the plain and offered the enemy battle This was the disposition that Hannibal had long wished for and pretending to be very earnest in taking possession of an hill which commanded the camp of the Romans he drew the eyes of all to that quarter while he formed an ambuscade on the other side with orders to sally forth in the midst of the engagement The Romans accordingly made most a vigorous attack upon the Carthaginians who had taken possession of the hill while new reinforcements were sent from either army At last Minucius drew out his  legions and the engagement became general It was then that the superior conduct of the Carthaginian commander was discovered for the men who were placed in ambush sallying forth upon the rear began to throw the whole Roman army into confusion and nothing less than a total defeat threatened to ensue In the mean time Fabius who was returned from Rome after solliciting an exchange of prisoners and after selling all his little patrimony to raise a sum which he was denied by the senate to pay their ransom came in while Minucius was in this desperate situation He did not long hesitate upon the course he should pursue but falling upon the Carthaginians at once stopt the flight of the Romans and obstructed the enemies pursuit Hannibal now perceived that the cloud which had so long hovered upon the mountains at last broke upon him in a storm he was obliged to command a retreat while Minucius was so convinced of his former rashness that he confessed his error to Fabius whom he now called his father and renouncing his new power again subjected his office freely to the dictatorship  Soon after however Fabius was obliged to lay down his office his time being expired and a violent contest ensued at Rome about the proper persons to be elected to the consulship The patricians and the plebeians as usual taking  opposite sides at last the multitude prevailed and Terentius Varro was chosen alone by the majority of voices in the assembly of the people This Terentius Varro was a man sprung from the dregs of the people and with nothing but his confidence and riches to recommend him He had long aspired at the highest offices of the state being ignorant vain boastful and confident but fond of popular applause and seeking it by all the arts of meanness and adulation With him was joined Aemilius Paulus of a disposition entirely opposite experienced in the field cautious in action and impressed with a thorough contempt of the abilities of his plebeian colleague Fabius who had just resigned his office saw with his usual sagacity the danger that threatened the state from two such illmatched commanders and entreated Aemilius by all he held dear to guard against the devices of Hannibal and the rashness of Terentius Varro However it was now no time for indulging fearful apprehensions the enemy being at hand and the Romans finding themselves enabled to bring a competent force into the field being almost ninety thousand strong  Hannibal was at this time encamped near the village of Cannae with a wind that for a certain season blows still one way in his rear which raising great clouds of dust from the parched plains behind he knew must greatly  distress an approaching enemy In this situation he waited the coming up of the Romans with an army of forty thousand foot and half that number of cavalry The two consuls soon appeared to his wish dividing their forces into two parts and agreeing to take the command every day by turns On the first day of their arrival it falling to the lot of Aemilius to command he was entirely averse to engaging and though Hannibal did all that lay in his power by insulting his men in their camp and his colleague by reproaching his timidity to bring him to a battle yet he obstinately declined fighting conscious of the enemy's superior disposition The next day however it being come to Varro's turn to command he without asking his colleague's concurrence gave the signal for battle and passing the river Aufidus that lay between both armies put his forces in array The two consuls commanded the two wings Varro on the right and Aemilius on the left to him also was consigned the general conduct of the engagement On the other hand Hannibal who had been from daybreak employed in the field marshalling his forces as they came up and inspiring them with courage by his voice and example had so artfully disposed them that both the wind and the sun were in his favour His cavalry were ordered to oppose those of  Rome His heavy armed African infantry were placed in either wing These says the historian might have been mistaken for a Roman army themselves being dressed in the spoils of such as were killed at Trebia and Thrasymene Next these were the Gauls a fierce people naked from the waist bearing large round shields and swords of an enormous size blunted at the point The Spaniards were placed in the centre brandishing short pointed daggers and drest in linnen vests embroidered with the brightest scarlet Asdrubal commanded the left wing the right was given to Maherbal and Hannibal himself fought on foot in the centre of the army The battle began with the lightarmed infantry the horse engaged soon after and the Roman cavalry being unable to stand against those of Numidia the legions came up to reinforce them It was then that the conflict became general the Roman soldiers for a long time endeavoured but in vain to penetrate the centre where the Gauls and Spaniards fought which Hannibal observing ordered part of those troops to give way and to permit the Romans to embosom themselves within a chosen body of his Africans whom he had placed on either wing so as to surround them upon that a terrible slaughter began to ensue of the Romans fatigued by their repeated attacks by the Africans who were fresh and vigorous  All the hopes of Rome now lay in the cavalry of the allies which yet continued unbroken but even on that side the great art of Hannibal discovered itself for having ordered five hundred of his Numidian horse who had daggers concealed under their coats of mail to go against the enemy and to make a shew of surrendering themselves prisoners of war these obeying and being placed by the allied cavalry for greater security in the rear while they were employed in combating the troops that opposed them in front all of a sudden these supposed prisoners fell upon them with their daggers from behind and put them into irrecoverable confusion Thus the rout at last became general in every part of the Roman army the boastings of Varro were now no longer heard while Aemilius who had been terribly wounded by a slinger in the very beginning of the engagement still feebly led on his body of horse and did all that could be done to make head against the enemy however being unable to sit on horseback he was forced to dismount as did also those who followed him but what could be expected from a measure dictated only by despair Tho' they fought with great intrepidity for some time they were at last obliged to give way those that were able remounting their horses and seeking safety by flight It was in this deplorable condition of things that one Lentulus  a tribune of the army as he was flying on horseback from the enemy which at some distance pursued him met the consul Aemilius sitting upon a stone covered over with blood and wounds and waiting for the coming up of the pursuers  "Aemilius" cried the generous tribune "you at least are guiltless of this day's slaughter take my horse while you have any strength remaining I will engage to assist and will with my life defend you We have already lost blood enough in the field do not make the day more dreadful by the loss of a commander" "I thank thee Lentulus" cried the dying consul "for ever guard thy virtue and may the gods recompence thy piety but as for me all is over my part is chosen do not therefore by attempting to persuade a desperate man lose the only means of procuring thine own safety Go I command thee and tell the senate from me to fortify Rome against the approach of the conqueror Tell Fabius also that Aemilius while living ever remembered his advice and now dying approves it"  While he was yet speaking the enemy approached and Lentulus before he was out of view saw the consul expire feebly fighting in the midst of them The slaughter had now continued for several hours till at last the conquerors quite wearied with destroying Hannibal gave  orders for them to desist and led them back to encampment a large body of Romans having previously surrendered upon condition of being dismissed without arms In this battle the Romans lost fifty thousand men two Quaestors twenty one Tribunes eighty senators and so many knights that it is said Hannibal sent three bushels of gold rings to Carthage which those of this order had worn on their fingers  This seemed the decisive blow that was to determine the fate of Rome it only now remained and was universally expected that Hannibal should march his army to the gates of the city and make it an easy conquest This was the advice of Maherbal his captain of the horse who when Hannibal rejected it could not help observing that the Carthaginian general was much more skillful in gaining victories than in improving them Indeed the justice of Maherbal's advice seems to appear from the general terror that universally prevailed in Rome at that time Nothing was heard throughout the city but shrieks and lamentations of women who on every side demanded their husbands or their children In vain for a time could the senators consult together being disturbed by the cries of the populace Nothing but terror appeared in every face and despair was the language of every tongue At  length when the first consternation was abated the senate came to a general resolution to create a dictator in order to give strength to their government Orders were also given to keep all women from coming abroad and spreading the consternation strict guards were placed at the city gates with strict injunctions that none should leave the city It was at this time that young Scipio whom we have already seen saving his father's life in battle was now resolved to save his country also He was then but a tribune of the army and being retired the night after the battle to a little town in the neighbourhood of Rome was informed that some young men of the first families in the city were at a certain house preparing to abandon their country and resolving to seek for safety elsewhere He was instantly filled with indignation at their pusilanimity he therefore resolved to prevent that influence which their example might have upon others and turning to some of his fellow soldiers who were with him  "Let those cried he to whom Rome is dear follow me"  So saying he went directly to the house in question where he found them in actual deliberation Upon this laying his hand upon his sword  "I swear cried he that I will never abandon Rome and will never suffer that others should abandon it Those who will not take the same oath are  not only their country's enemies but mine"  The resolute manner in which he spoke this together with his known courage in some measure intimidated the conspirators they all took the same oath and vowed rather than forsake Rome▪ to stay till they were buried beneath its ruins Thence forward the people seemed to gather new resolution the senate cenceived new hopes of victory and the augurs gave them assurance of a turn in their favour A short time after Varro arrived near Rome having left behind him wretched remains of his army he had been the principal cause of the late calamity and it was natural to suppose that the senate would severely reprimand the rashness of his conduct But fat otherwise The Romans went out in multitudes to meet him and the senate returned him thanks that he had not despaired of the safety of Rome Such a conquest over all the vindictive passions was much greater than the victory at Cannae The people being thus by Hannibal's delay inspired with fresh courage made all possible preparations for another campaign They armed their slaves and filled up the senate which wanted near half its number Fabius who was considered as the shield of Rome and Marcellus as the sword were appointed to lead the armies and though Hannibal once more offered them peace they refused it but upon condition  that he should quit Italy terms similar to those they had insisted upon from Pyrrhus before  In the mean time Hannibal either finding the impossibility of marching directly to Rome or willing to give his forces rest after such a mighty victory led them to Capua where he resolved to winter This city had long been considered as the nurse of luxury and the corrupter of all military virtue here therefore a new scene of pleasure opened to his barbarian troops and they at once gave themselves up to the intoxication till from being hardy veterans they became infirm rioters For this he has been greatly blamed by antiquity as losing that happy occasion when fortune seems kind and exchanging empire for dissipation but it is not considered what numberless obstacles he had to surmount and what an enemy he had to deal with Rome was as yet powerful it could bring into the field if we may judge from the latest estimate that was made of its numbers two hundred thousand fighting men it might therefore have been rashness itself in Hannibal to lead his army to the siege of a city strongly defended by art and with a garrison more than four times his equal We have only to give him credit upon this occasion for what he would have done by remembering the seeming impossibilities which he happily atchieved To have led and maintained a large  army consisting of various nations more than a thousand miles from home To have surmounted precipices which considering the place he entered Italy are to this day regarded as impassable To have fought successfully for many years in the heart of an enemies country To have by his single presence united into obedience and formed into one body an army composed of Spaniards Africans Gauls and Ligurians and kept them steady to him though often wanting bread To have an obstinate enemy to combat and faithless employers at home who retarded because they envied his successes When we consider him as triumphing over all these obstacles by the strength of his own genius only we view in him the most august spectacle that all antiquity has ever exhibited  Hitherto we have found this great man successful but now we are to reverse the picture and survey him struggling with accumulated misfortunes and at last sinking beneath them His first repulse was from his own countrymen at home Whilst at Rome the thanks of the senate were voted to a consul who fled at Carthage Hanno one of their former generals began to form a party against Hannibal and more an enemy to his rival than to the Romans themselves forgot nothing that might obstruct  the successes he had in prospect or tarnish the splendor of those he had already obtained Upon Hannibal's sending for a new supply of men and money to the senate of Carthage  "What would this man have asked" cried Hanno" "if he had lost a battle when he makes such draughts upon us after gaining a victory No no he is either an impostor that amuses us with false news or a public robber that enriches himself and not his country"  This opposition the effects of which still continued to operate delayed the necessary succours though it could not hinder their tardy compliance Thus being frequently destitute of money and provisions and reduced to the necessity of being always successful with no recruits of strength in case of ill fortune and no encouragement even in the good it is not to be wondered at that his affairs began at length to decline and that those of the opposing generals began to prosper whose employers observed a contrary conduct  His first loss was at the siege of Nola where Marcellus the praetor made a successful sally He some time after attempted to raise the siege of Capua and attacked the Romans in their trenches but he was repulsed with considerable loss He then made a feint of going to besiege Rome but finding a superior army ready to  receive him he was obliged to retire For some years after he fought with various success Marcellus  his opponent sometimes gaining and sometimes losing the advantage but coming to no decisive engagement However even victories themselves could not restore the affairs of Hannibal for though these might lessen the number of his enemies forces he had exhausted all the arts of recruiting his own  The senate of Carthage at length came to a resolution of sending his brother Asdrubal to his assistance with a body of forces drawn out of Spain Asdrubal's march being made known to the consuls Livius and Nero they went against him with great expedition and surrounded him in a place into which he was  ed by the treachery of his guides and cut his whole army to pieces Hannibal had long expected these succours with impatience and the very night on which he had been assured of his brother's arrival Nero ordered Asdrubal's head to be cut off and thrown into his camp He now therefore began to perceive the approaches of the downfal of Carthage and could not help with a sigh observing to those about him that fortune seemed fatigued with granting favours  But it was not in Italy alone that the affairs of Carthage seemed to decline for the Romans while yet bleeding from their defeat at Cannae  sent legions into Spain Sardinia and Sicily This unconquerable people surrounded by enemies on every side still found resources to oppose them all they not only fought those nations but appointed fresh succours to the few allies that yet adhered to them they made head against Hannibal in Italy and still more undertook a new war against Philip king of Macedon for having made a league with the Carthaginians Fortune seemed to favour them in almost all their enterprizes Laevinus the consul gained considerable advantages over Philip and Marcellus took Syracuse in Sicily which was defended by the machines and fires of Archimedes the mathematician  This great city first invited the efforts of the besiegers as it was generally thought indefensible and its riches were immense The Romans therefore sate down before it with the expectation of a speedy surrender and immense plunder But the wisdom of one man alone seemed to suspend its fate this was Archimedes the celebrated mathematician many of whose works are still remaining he destroying their men and demolishing their shipping He so united the powers of mechanism that he raised their vessels into the air and then let them dash to pieces by the violence of their fall He also made use of burning glasses which at the distance of some hundred yards  set the Roman ships and wooden towers on fire At last however the town was taken on a great festival by surprize The inhabitants were put to the sword and among the rest Archimedes who was found meditating in his study was slain by a Roman soldier Marcellus the general was not a little grieved at his death a passion for letters at that time began to prevail among the higher ranks of people at Rome He therefore ordered his body to be honourably buried and a tomb to be erected to his memory which however his works have long survived  As for their fortunes in Spain though for a while they appeared doubtful two of the Scipios being slain and Claudius Nero the governor of the province much an undermatch for the cunning of the Carthaginian general yet they soon recovered their complexion under the conduct of Scipio Africanus who sued for the office of proconsul for that kingdom at a time when every one else was willing to decline it Scipio who was now but twentyfour years old had all the qualifications requisite for forming a great general and a good man he united the greatest courage with the greatest tenderness superior to Hannibal in the arts of peace and almost his equal in those of war His father had been killed in Spain so that he seemed to have an hereditary claim to the conquest of the country He therefore appeared irresistible  obtaining many great victories yet subduing still more by his generosity mildness and benevolent disposition than by the force of his arms Among other instances of the greatness of Scipio's mind was the following upon the taking of New Carthage he treated his prisoners with the utmost lenity and different from other generals who permitted every barbarity to their soldiers he repressed his men from doing any injury to such as sued for mercy Among the prisoners that were made at the taking this city a young princess was brought before him of the most exquisite beauty she had been promised to Alleucius a prince of that country who loved her with the most ardent passion and had felt the most poignant distress for her captivity It was thought by the sollicitude the generous Roman seemed to shew that he designed asking her from her parents for himself and more so when he desired that the prince and they might come before him The young prince approached trembling with anxiety expecting to hear that his mistress who was now the property of another was intended to promote the happiness of her conqueror but his fears were dispelled when Scipio giving the princess to his arms bade him take what was his by a prior claim and only desired his friendship and alliance in return at the same time he refused the ransom which her parents  had brought and when they pressed him to take it he desired it might be added to her portion It was by such generous acts as these as well as the fortune of his arms that he reduced the whole country to the obedience of the empire  In this manner Spain and Sicily being added to the Roman empire it now found resources for continuing the Punic war However Hannibal still kept his ground in Italy although he was unsupported at home and but indifferently assisted by the alliances he had made since his crossing the Alps He had now continued in this country for more than fourteen years and as Polybius says had never lost a single battle where he himself was the commader But it was now too late to retrieve his fortune the Romans were taught his own arts his old army was worn out either with excesses of fatigue or debauchery his countrymen had given over sending new supplies so that he had nothing now to make him formidable but the fame of his former good fortune  It was in this posture of his affairs that Scipio returned with an army from the conquest of Spain and was made consul at the age of twentynine It was at first supposed he intended meeting Hannibal in Italy and that he would attempt driving him from thence but he had already formed a wiser plan which was  to carry the war into Africa and while the Carthaginians kept an army near Rome to make them tremble for their own capital This measure was opposed with great heat by Fabius and thereupon a considerable difference arose but at last it was determined by the senate that Scipio should be granted Sicily for his province and that leave should be given him to pass over into Africa if he saw it convenient for the interests of Rome This he considered as a concurrence with his aims he accordingly spent the first year in Sicily providing necessaries for his intended expedition and went over into Africa the beginning of the next with a large fleet where he was joined by Massinissa the deposed king of Numidia with whom he had made an alliance in Spain  Scipio was not long in Africa without employment for in a short time Hanno opposed him who was defeated and slain Syphax the usurper of Numidia led up a large army against him The Roman general for a time declined fighting till finding an opportunity he set fire to the enemy's tents and attacking him in the midst of the confusion killed forty thousand of his men and took six thousand prisoners Not long after Syphax willing to strike one blow more for empire and fearing that his kingdom would return to the true possessor in case the the Romans should succeed gathered together a  numerous army of various nations and with these unexperienced troops marched against Scipio His former ill fortune followed him he was soon defeated and he himself taken prisoner Massinissa being thus put in possession of the usurper's person the better to regain his kingdom marched with the utmost expedition to Cirta the chief city and shewing Syphax in bonds procured the gates to be opened every one striving to make up their former disloyalty by their ready obedience In this manner Massinissa became possessed of the royal palace and and all the wealth of the late king but among the rest of a treasure that he esteemed above all Sophonisba the wife of Syphax Sophonisba was the daughter of Asdrubal one of the Carthaginian generals she was a woman of great ambition and incomparable beauty it was she that from the beginning had incited Syphax to declare against Rome in favour of Carthage and the influence of her charms was such that he gave up safety to be possessed of love Upon Massinissa's entering the palace he was met by the queen who with all the allurements of weeping beauty fell at his feet and entreated him to spare her youth and not deliver her up to the Romans who were prepared to take revenge upon her for all the injuries done them by her father While she yet hung upon his knees and in some measure  mixed caresses with her entreaties Massinssa found himself touched with a passion that was something more than pity he fell in love he therefore quickly granted her request and finding her not averse to his sollicitations the very day they first met was that of their nuptials The first account that Scipio had of this hasty and unjust marriage was from the unfortunate Syphax himself who attempted to palliate his enmity to Rome by throwing the blame upon Sophonisba and then described the wretchedness of his situation with an eloquence pointed by jealousy Scipio was instantly fired with resentment at the conduct of the young king he now saw that all his former lectures exhorting to continence and humanity were but thrown away he therefore desired to speak with Massinissa in private where he urged the cruelty the impropriety and the injustice of taking the wife of another and that on the very day on which he had lost his liberty and his kingdom he entreated the young king to recollect his former virtuous resolutions and reject a passion that was attended with infamy Finding however these remonstrances make no impression he added that Syphax was now the prisoner of Rome that he must wait upon the senate and that his queen who was a prisoner also must attend him there Massinissa now finding that the obstacles to his happiness were insurmountable  left the general in a seeming acquiescence in his advice but feeling all that tumult of passions which disappointed love and ungoverned inclination could excite at last called one of his slaves who carried poison according to the custom of barbarian kings  "Go" said he "and present the queen from me with a bowl of poison death is now the only way she has left of escaping the power of the Romans The daughter of Asdrubal and the wife of a king will consult for glory"  When the slave presented his mistress with the bowl  "I take it" cried she "as the kindest offering he can make In the mean time inform him that my death would have been more glorious had it been more remote from my marriage"  So saying she drank off the poison with intrepidity and died without shewing any signs of terror  In the mean time while these things were transacting at Cirta the Carthaginians were so terrified at their repeated defeats and the fame of Scipio's former successes that they determined to recall Hannibal their great champion out of Italy in order to oppose the Romans at home Deputies were accordingly dispatched with a positive command to return and oppose the Roman general who at that time threatened Carthage with a siege Nothing could exceed  the regret and disappointment of Hannibal upon receiving this order he had long foreseen the ruin of his country but at the same time knew that Italy was the only place in which its fate could be suspended However he obeyed the orders of the infatuated people with the same submission that the meanest soldier would have done and took leave of Italy with tears in his eyes after having kept possession of the most beautiful parts of it for above fifteen years  After a melancholly passage from Italy where he had lost his two brothers and most of his bravest generals and left the allies of his country to the fury of the conquerors he arrived at Leptis in Africa from whence he marched to Adrumetum and at last approached Zama a city within five days journey of Carthage Scipio in the mean time led his army to meet him joined by Massinissa with six thousand horse and to shew his rival in the field how little he feared his approach sent back the spies which were sent to explore his camp having previously shewn them the whole with directions to inform Hannibal of what they had seen The Carthaginian general soon found out the superior force of the enemy composed of the flower of the Romans while his own army was now but a mixture of various nations drawn together by necessity with no experience  and with little other discipline but what the short time he commanded them could give The troops that almost subdued all Italy were worn out or but nominally existing in his army Conscious of this therefore his first endeavours were to discontinue the war by negotiation and he therefore desired a meeting with Scipio to confer upon terms of peace to which the Roman general assented It was in a large plain between the two armies that the two greatest generals in the world came to this interview both for a while silently regarded his opponent as if struck with mutual reverence and esteem Scipio was in figure adorned with all advantages of manly beauty Hannibal bore the marks in his visage of hard campaigns and being blind of one eye it gave a stern air to his countenance Hannibal spoke first to this effect  "Were I not convinced of the equity of the Romans I would not this day have come to demand peace from the son over whose father I have formerly been victorious Would to heaven that the same moderation which I hope inspires us at this day had prevailed among us at the beginning of the war that you had been content with the limits of your Italian dominions and that we had never aimed at adding Sicily to our empire we had then on both sides spared that blood which no rewards from victory can repay  As for myself age has taught me the inanity of triumphs and the instability of fortune but you are young and perhaps not yet lessoned in the school of adversity you are now what I was after the battles of Cannae and Thrasymene you perhaps will aim at splendid rather than at useful virtues But consider that peace is the end at which all victories aim and that peace I am sent here by my country to offer do not therefore expose to the hazard of an hour that fame which you have obtained by an age of conquests At present Scipio fortune is in your power a moment of time may give it to your enemy But let me not call myself such it is Hannibal that now addresses you Hannibal that esteems your virtues and desires your friendship Peace will be useful to us both as for me I shall be proud of the alliance of Rome and as for you you will convert an active enemy into a stedfast friend"  To this Scipio replied  "That as to the wars which he complained of as they were begun by the Carthaginians so they must abide by the consequence That as to himself he could never condemn his own perseverance on the side of justice That some late outrages had been committed during a late truce which required the greater reparation which if consented  to he was willing to conclude a treaty"  Both sides parting dissatisfied they returned to their camps to prepare for deciding the controversy by the sword Never was a more memorable battle fought whether we regard the generals the armies the two states that contended or the empire that was in dispute The disposition Hannibal made of his men is said by the skillful in the art of war to be superior to any even of his former arrangements He encouraged the various nations of his army by the differing motives which led them to the field to the mercenaries he promised a discharge of their arrears and double pay with plunder in case of a victory the Gauls he inspired by aggravating their natural hatred to the Romans the Numidians by representing the cruelty of their new king and the Carthaginians by reminding them of their country their glory their danger of servitude and their desire of freedom Scipio on the other hand with a chearful countenance bade his men rejoice for that their labours and their dangers were now near an end That the gods had given Carthage into their hands and that they should soon return triumphant to their friends their wives and their children The battle began by the elephants on the side of the Carthaginians which being terrified by the cries of the Romans and wounded by the slingers and archers  turned upon themselves and caused much confusion in both wings of their army in which the cavalry was placed Being thus deprived of the assistance of the horse in which their greatest strength consisted the heavy infantry joined on both sides The Romans were more vigorous and powerful in the shock the Carthaginians more active and ready However they were unable to withstand the continued pressure of the Roman shields but at first gave way a little and this soon brought on a general flight The rear guard who had orders from Hannibal to oppose those that fled now began to attack their own forces so that the body of the infantry sustained a double encounter of those who caused their flight and those who endeavoured to prevent it At length however the general finding that they were not to be made to stand directed that they should fall behind while he brought up his fresh forces to oppose the pursuers Scipio upon this immediately sounded a retreat in order to bring up his men a second time in good order And now the combat began afresh between the flower of both armies The Carthaginians however having been deprived of the succour of their elephants and their horse and their enemies being stronger of body were obliged to give ground In the mean time Massinissa who had been in pursuit of their  cavalry returning and attacking them in the rear compleated their defeat A total rout ensued twenty thousand men were killed in battle or the pursuit and as many were taken prisoners Hannibal who had done all that a great general and an undaunted soldier could perform fled with a small body of horse to Adrumetum fortune seeming to delight in confounding his ability his valour and experience  This victory brought on a peace The Carthaginians by Hannibal's advice offered conditions to the Romans which they dictated not as rivals but as sovereigns By this treaty the Carthaginians were obliged to quit Spain and all the Islands in the Mediterranean sea They were bound to pay ten thousand talents in fifty years to give hostages for the delivery of their ships and their elephants To restore Massinissa all the territories that had been taken from him and not to make war in Africa but by the permission of the Romans Thus ended the second Punic war seventeen years after it had begun Carthage still continued an empire but without power to defend its possessions and only waiting the pleasure of the conquerors when they should think proper to end the period of its continuance After the  depression of this mighty dominion the Romans were scarce engaged but in petty wars  and obtained mighty victories whereas before they had obtained but petty victories and were engaged in dangerous wars  CHAP XVII From the end of the second Punic war to the end of the third which terminated in the destruction of Carthage  UPON the conclusion of so great and long a war as that of Carthage there seemed to arise a certain spirit in the Roman republic unknown till that time Men till now had received distinction from their abilities their families their offices or their virtues but upon the conquest of such various countries such great riches and so many slaves were brought into Rome that the manners of the people began to alter Riches gave them a taste for pleasures unknown before and the slaves they had taken were put to those offices of labour and husbandry that had formerly contributed to harden the warrior and mark the character of Roman simplicity Their love of their country and their zeal for the public good seemed exhausted in the war against Hannibal many had given up their whole fortunes to the republic and not finding  that recompence in peace which the publick was as yet unable to grant them they suffered neglect patiently for a while and at last converted their anger at the ingratitude of the state into a desire of private interest they sought new connections in society and forgetting the whole laboured to form particular dependencies  The senate however prosecuted new wars rather with a view of keeping these spirits employed from doing harm to the empire than of advancing its interests They continued to carry on the Macedonian war against Philip who as was said before had entered into an alliance with the Carthaginians during the conquests of Hannibal To this war the Romans were not a little incited by the prayers of the Athenians that polite people who from once controlling the power of Persia were now unable to defend themselves The Rhodians with Attalus king of Pergamus also entered into the confederacy against Philip He was more than once defeated by Galba the consul who was sent against him He attempted to besiege Athens but the Romans obliged him to raise the siege He attempted to take possession of the streights of Thermopylae but was driven from them by Quintus Flaminius with great slaughter He attempted to take refuge in Thessaly where he was again defeated  with considerable loss and obliged to beg a peace upon condition of paying a thousand talents half down and the other half in the space of ten years The peace with Philip gave the Romans an opportunity of shewing their generosity by restoring liberty to Greece They had for some time submitted to the institutions of this most refined people and now out of a principle of gratitude endeavoured to recompence their masters The senate therefore sent over ten men of the first rank with Flamminius at their head to proclaim an universal freedom at the Isthmian games where the people were assembled This was the most surprizing and joyful gift that could be imagined to a people panting after liberty and whose ancestors had spent their dearest blood in its cause The Greeks gave them all the return that was now in their power namely praise this satisfied the Romans for vanity was now the ruling passion of the times and thus ended what was called the first Macedonian war five years after  it was last proclaimed and twenty after it had begun  During the continuance of this war the Gauls who had joined with Hannibal received some signal overthrows The Spaniards also who had revolted were quelled by Cato the censor The Ligurians though joining with the Gauls were subdued Nabis the deposed king of Lacedaemon  opposed the Romans but was forced to submit Scarce any nation or prince of power attempted to oppose them that was not overthrown Antiochus king of Syria was a monarch whose strength and fame invited their ambition and after some embassies on the one side and the other a war was declared against him five years after the conclusion of the Macedonian war The pretext of the Romans was  that he had made encroachments upon the Grecian states who were their allies and that he had given refuge to Hannibal their inveterate enemy who had been expelled from Carthage This Antiochus who was surnamed the Great was one of Alexander's successors a potent prince bold ambitious and master of very extensive dominions which his personal abilities invigorated and inspired The Aetolians who had imagined they should bear sway in Greece by joining with the Romans found too late that they had only brought themselves to share the general subjection in which the rest of the states of Greece were held under the specious denomination of freedom In order therefore to correct one extravagance by another they had invited this prince among them in the same manner as before they had invited the Romans He accordingly came to their assistance but with an army rather as if he intended only to be a spectator than a manager  of the war and instead of preparing for the Romans sate down at Ephesus to take his pleasures Being however apprized of the enemies approach he endeavoured to treat for a peace this not succeeding he placed his dependance on his maritime forces but even there his expectations were frustrated though the great Hannibal was his admiral In the midst of the consternation occasioned by these misfortunes he abandoned Lysimachia a place where he might have held the enemy for a year and adding one indiscretion to another suffered Scipio brother to the famous Africanus to pass the Hellespont with his army without opposition He then attempted to obtain a peace by offering to quit all places in Europe and such in Asia as profest alliance with Rome But it was now too late the Roman general perceived his own superiority and was resolved to avail himself of it Antiochus thus driven into resistance for some time retreated before the enemy till being pressed hard near the city of Magnesia he was forced to draw out his men to the number of seventy thousand foot and twelve thousand horse Scipio opposed him with forces as much inferior in number as they were superior in courage and discipline He was in a short time entirely defeated his own chariots armed with scythes being driven back upon his men contributed  much to his overthrow Antiochus thus reduced to the last extremity was glad to procure peace of the Romans upon their own terms which were to pay fifteen thousand talents towards the expences of the war to quit all possessions in Europe and likewise all in Asia on that side Mount Taurus to give twenty hostages as pledges of his fidelity and to deliver up Hannibal the inveterate enemy of Rome Thus ended the war with Antiochus twelve years after the second Punic war and two after it had been begun Lucius Scipio who conducted it with the assistance of his brother Scipio Africanus who went as his lieutenant was called Asiaticus from his success in Asia  In the mean time Hannibal whose destruction was one of the articles of this extorted treaty endeavoured to avoid the threatened ruin This consummate general had been long a wanderer and an exile from his ungrateful country all that prudence or justice could inspire he had done for the safety of Carthage even after the battle which he had lost at Zama Upon his return to his native city he found the public treasures exhausted among those who pretended to collect them and when he endeavoured to punish their avarice they accused him to the Romans of attempting to renew the war This bringing on a demand that he  should be delivered up he resolved to yield to the necessity of the times and fly Thus leaving Carthage in the very robe he wore in council and attended only by two followers who were ignorant of his intentions he began his voluntary exile After two days travelling by land he embarked and landed on a little island in the Mediterranean sea There being known by one who had formerly fought under his command he was quickly surrounded by the inhabitants who came from motives of reverence and curiosity From thence he failed to Tyre where he met with a kind reception from the inhabitants who remembered their ancient alliance with Carthage He thence went to the court of Antiochus who at first gave him a sincere welcome and made him admiral of his fleet in which station he shewed his usual skill in stratagem But he soon sunk in the Syrian's esteem for having advised schemes which that monarch had neither genius to understand nor talents to execute particularly that of a second invasion of Italy At last finding himself destined to be given up in order to propitiate the Romans and confirm the peace and finding no hopes of safety or protection there he departed by stealth and after wandering for a time among petty states who had neither power nor generosity to protect him he took refuge at the court of Prusias king of Bithynia However  the Romans with a vindictive spirit utterly unworthy of them sent Aemilius one of their most celebrated generals to demand him of this king who fearing the resentment of Rome and willing to conciliate their friendship by this breach of hospitality ordered a guard to be placed upon Hannibal with an intention of delivering him up The old general thus implacably persecuted from one country to another and finding all methods of safety cut off determined to die he therefore desired one of his followers to bring him poison which he had prepared for this exigence and while he was preparing to take it  "Let us rid the Romans" says he "of their terrors since they are unwilling to wait for the death of an old man like me there was a time when there was more generosity remaining among them they have been known to guard their enemy from poison and now they basely send an embassy to seek the life of a banished man and to make a feeble monarch break the laws of hospitality"  Thus saying and drinking the poison he expired as he had lived with intrepid bravery  In the mean time while these things were doing abroad the spirit of dissention seemed to rekindle in Rome In the third year after ending the war with Antiochus the tribunes of the people undertook to accuse Scipio Africanus of  defrauding the treasury of the plunder which was taken in war and of too intimate a correspondence with that king Accordingly a day was set him by the tribunes to answer for his conduct Scipio appeared at the appointed time but instead of attempting a defence he reminded his countrymen that on that very day he had gained the victory of Zama This struck the assembly of the people so strongly that they all left the tribunes in the Forum and went to attend Scipio to the Capitol to return their annual thanks to the gods for the victory The tribunes finding themselves disappointed here were resolved to accuse him in the senate and desired that he should bring his accounts to answer to their charge Scipio instead of gratifying them even in this tore his accounts before them and soon after withdrew to Linternum a town on the coast of Campania where he spent the rest of his life in peace and privacy he lived however but three years longer testifying his displeasure against his countrymen by the epitaph which he ordered to be engraved on his tomb  "Ungrateful country my very bones shall not rest among you"  This was the same year on which Hannibal died as also Philopoemen a Grecian  general who was reckoned equal to either of the former  The factious spirit which was now excited in the republic continued for some years during all their subsequent wars and victories over the Ligurians Istrians Sardinians Corsicans and Macedonians for the Romans soon after entered into a second Macedonian war This was with  Perseus the son of Philip the king of that country whom we have already seen obliged to beg a peace of the Romans Perseus in order to secure the crown had contrived to murder his brother Demetrius and upon the death of his father pleased with the hopes of imaginary triumphs made war against Rome During the course of this war which continued about three years many opportunities were offered him of cutting off the Roman army but being perfectly ignorant of making his advantage of their rashness he spent the time in empty overtures for a peace At length Aemilius gave him a decisive overthrow near the river Enipeus He attempted to procure safety by flying into Crete but being abandoned by all he was obliged to surrender himself and to grace the splendid triumph of the Roman general He was led with his two sons before the conqueror's chariot into Rome while Gentius king of the Illyrians and his confederates was in the same manner led captive before the chariot of Lucius Amicius one of the Roman admirals  These wars which brought immense riches into the Roman treasury were no sooner finished▪ than they found a pretext to enter upon the third and last Punic war Carthage was now a state that only subsisted by the mercy of the conquerors and was to fall at the slightest breath of their indignation About this time Massinissa the Numidian having made some incursions into a territory claimed by the Carthaginians they attempted to repel the invasion This brought on a war between that monarch and them while the Romans who pretended to consider this conduct of theirs as an infraction of the treaty sent to them to make complaint The ambassadors who were employed upon this occasion finding the city very rich and flourishing from the long interval of peace which it had now enjoyed for near fifty years either from motives of avarice to possess its plunder or from fear of its growing greatness insisted much on the necessity of a war Among the chief of these was Cato who never spoke in the senate upon public business but he ended his speech by inculcating the necessity of destroying Carthage It was in vain that he was opposed by Nasica who with more sagacious forecast urged the danger of destroying a rival state that still would be an incentive to Roman discipline Cato's opinion prevailed and the senate having a fair pretence to begin ordered  war to be proclaimed and the consuls set out with a thorough resolution utterly to demolish Carthage  The Carthaginians now too late perceived the wisdom of Hannibal who had foreseen the consequences of their conduct but it was not till they had found their want of him Affrighted at the Roman preparations for they had during this long period been only intent on amassing private wealth and no way careful for public safety they immediately condemned those who had broken the league and most humbly offered any reasonable satisfaction To these submissions the senate only returned an evasive answer demanding three hundred hostages within thirty days as a security for their future conduct and an implicit obedience to their further commands With these articles it was supposed the Carthaginians would not comply but it turned out otherwise for this infatuated people desiring peace on any terms sent their children within the limitted time and the consuls landing at Utica soon after were waited upon by deputies from Carthage to know the senate's further demands as certain of a ready compliance Upon this the Roman generals were not a little perplexed in what manner to force them into disobedience wherefore Censorinus the consul commending their diligence demanded all their arms but these also contrary  to expectation they delivered up At last they found that the conquerors would not desist making demands while the vanquished had any thing left to supply They now therefore received orders to leave their city which was to be levelled with the ground being granted at the same time permission to build another in any part of their territories within ten miles of the sea This severe command they received with all the concern and distress of a despairing people they implored for a respite from such an hard sentence they used tears and lamentations but finding the consuls inexorable they departed with a gloomy resolution prepared to suffer the utmost extremities and to fight to the last for their seat of empire and ancient habitation  Upon returning home and divulging the ill success of their commission a general spirit of resistance seemed to inspire the whole people they now too late began to see the danger of riches in a state when it had no longer power to defend them Those vessels therefore of gold and silver which their luxury had taken such pride in were converted into arms as they had given up their iron which was in their present circumstances the most precious metal The women parted also with their ornaments and even cut off their hair to be converted into strings for the bowmen Asdrubal  who had been lately condemned for opposing the Romans was now taken from prison to head their army and such preparations were made that when the consuls came before the city which they expected to find an easy conquest they met such resistance as quite dispirited their forces and shook their resolution Several engagements were fought before the walls with disadvantage to the assailants so that the siege would have been discontinued had not Scipio Aemilianus the adopted son of Africanus who was now appointed to command it used as much skill to save his forces after a defeat as to inspire them with fresh hopes of victory But all his arts would have failed had he not found means to seduce Phar  e  s the master of the Carthaginian horse who came over to his side He from that time went on successfully that part of Carthage called Megara was the first that was taken while the inhabitants were driven into the citadel He then secured the isthmus which led to the city and thus cut off all supplies of provisions from the country He next blocked up the haven but the besieged with incredible industry cut out a new passage into the sea whereby at certain times they could receive necessaries from  army without That army therefore was t be subdued ere the city could be thoroughly invested Wherefore Scipio set upon them in  the beginning of the ensuing winter killed seventy thousand of their men and took ten thousand prisoners of war The unhappy townsmen now bereft of all external succour resolved upon every extremity rather than submit but they soon saw the enemy make nearer approaches the wall which led to the haven was quickly demolished soon after the Forum itself was taken which offered the conquerors a deplorable spectacle of houses tottering to the fall heaps of men lying dead beneath hundreds of the wounded struggling to emerge from the carnage around them and deploring their own and their country's ruin The citadel soon after surrendered at discretion All now but the temple was subdued and that was defended by deserters and those who had been most forward to undertake the war These however expecting no mercy and finding their condition desperate set fire to the building and voluntarily perished in the flames Asdrubal the Carthaginian general delivered himself up to the Romans when the citadel was taken but his wife and two children rushed into the temple while yet on fire and expired with their country Then was this magnificent city laid in ashes by the merciless conquerors and so extensive was it being twentyfour miles in compass that the burning continued for seventeen days together The senate of Rome ordered that no part of it should  be rebuilt it was demolished to the ground so that travellers are unable to say where Carthage stood at this day All the cities which assisted Carthage in this war were ordered to share the same fate and the lands belonging to them were given to the friends of the Romans The other towns of Afric became tributary to Rome and were governed by an annual praetor while the numberless captives who were taken in the course of this war were sold as slaves except some few who were adjudged to die by the hands of the executioner This was the end of one of the most renowned cities in the world both for arts opulence and extent of dominion it had rivalled Rome for above an hundred years and at one time was thought to have the superiority But all the grandeur of Carthage was founded on commerce alone which is ever fluctuating and at best serves to dress up a nation to invite conquest and only to adorn the victim for its destruction  This conquest over Carthage was soon followed by many over other states Corinth one of the noblest cities of Greece in the same year sustained the same fate being entered by Mummius the consul and levelled to the ground The pretext for this violence was that the Achaeans had declared war against the Lacedaemonians who were in alliance with Rome Metellus the consul in consequence of  this drawing his army into Baeotia overthrew their general Critolaus and Mummius succeeding him in the command overthrew Dicas the Achean general and in consequence entered and demolished Corinth the spoils of which afterwards not a little contributed to embellish Rome Spain though at first victorious was soon after entirely subdued Viriatus the Spanish commander who from a shepherd became a robber and from that a general over a numerous body of men like himself gave the Romans some trouble but was taken off by the basest treachery Caepio the Roman general having bribed his own ambassadors who were sent to treat of a peace to murder their master in his bed upon their return Quintus Pompeius and Mancianus also gained no greater honour by combating this brave people they were both obliged in order to save their armies to make so disadvantageous a treaty that the senate by a mean subterfuge sent back Mancianus bound for concluding upon terms with which they refused to concur Lepidus also was equally unsuccessful for setting upon the Vaccaei an harmless and peaceable people of that country he was entirely defeated At last however Scipio who had destroyed Carthage and who now like the former of that name was also surnamed Africanus being made consul restored the fortune of Rome and laying siege to Numantia  the strongest city in Spain the wretched inhabitants to avoid falling into the hands of the enemy fired the city over their own heads and all to a man expired in the flames thus Spain became a province to Rome and was governed thenceforward by two annual praetors From this treatment given to the conquered we see how very different the Romans were from their ancestors whose boast it was to use lenity to those whom they had subdued But few nations can withstand the intoxication of success as they began to consider the whole world as their own they resolved to treat all those who withstood their arms not as opposers but revolters  CHAP XVIII From the destruction of Carthage to the end of the sedition of the Gracchi  WE have hitherto seen this great people by  slow degrees rising into power and at length reigning without a rival We have hitherto seen all the virtues which give strength and conquest one by one entering into the state and forming an unconquerable empire From this time forward we are to survey a different picture a powerful state giving admission to all  the vices that tend to divide enslave and at last totally destroy it This seems to be the great period of Roman power their conquests afterwards might be more numerous and their dominions more extensive but their extension was rather an increase of glory than of strength For a long time even after the admission of their vices the benefits of their former virtues continued to operate but their future triumphs rather spread their power than increased it they rather gave it surface than solidity They now began daily to degenerate from their ancient modesty plainness and severity of life The triumphs and the spoils of Asia brought in a taste for splendid expence and these produced avarice and inverted ambition so that from henceforward the history seems that of another people  The two Gracchi were the first who saw this strange corruption among the great and resolved to repress it by renewing the Licinian law which as we have seen had enacted that no person in the state should possess above five hundred acres of land but that the overplus should become the property of the state Tiberius Gracchus the elder of the two was a person very considerable both for the advantages of his body and the qualities of his mind Very different from Scipio of whom he was the grandson he seemed more ambitious of  power than desirous of glory he had a mind fonder of embracing novelties than of advancing or supporting establishments already made his contempt of money was apparent and this only served to lessen his power in a country that now began to set an immoderate value on riches his compassion for the oppressed was equal to his animosity against the oppressors but unhappily his passions rather than his reason operated even in his pursuits of virtue and these always drove him beyond the line of duty his designs seemed in the main honest but opposition put his intentions into disorder and though he began with principles of justice he was at last obliged to exchange his rectitude for his party This was the disposition of the elder Gracchus who found the lower part of the people for the distinction between patrician and plebeian was now no more ready to second all his proposals These after long services to the state found themselves exposed to the oppressions of the rich who by wresting the laws of which they had the management in their own favour seized upon all the property and left the poor only the danger and fatigue of defending it Their continual injuries however had alienated the hearts of the multitude which they concealed or thought it their duty to suffer while the senate unjust corrupt and mercenary were only intent on  covering their internal meanness by the dignity of their conquests abroad This was the state of parties when Tiberius Gracchus procured himself to be chosen tribune of the people It was he that had formerly attempted to retrench the power of Scipio Africanus and had set him a day to answer before the people and that now prevailed for preferring the Licinian law by which it was prohibited that any person should possess above five hundred acres of land But willing to prevent this law being wrested to the advantage of the great as it had hitherto been he caused it to be enacted also that one half or the illicit surplus should be given to the children of the transgressor and the other half given to such of the poor as had nothing and lest any by purchase should enlarge their possessions three officers were appointed called the Triumviri who were to determine and examine the quantity of land occupied by every individual This law though at first carried on with proper moderation greatly disgusted the rich who endeavoured to persuade the people that the proposer only aimed at disturbing the government and putting all things into confusion But Gracchus who was a man of the greatest eloquence of his time easily wiped off these impressions from minds already irritated with their wrongs▪ and besides willing enough to forward a law by which they were to be the only  gainers But while the poor were eager for passing this law the rich were equally strenuous in opposing it What was in the beginning but debate by degrees grew into enmity and the opposition seemed to kindle as it proceeded Octavius one of the tribunes who opposed the law was partly by art and partly by violence obliged to resign while Mummius who was in the opposite confederacy was elected tribune in his stead The death of Attalus king of Pergamus furnished Tiberius Gracchus with a new opportunity of gratifying the meaner part of the people at the expence of the great This king had by his last will left the Romans his he rs and it was now proposed that the money so left should be divided among the poor in order to furnish them with proper utensils for cultivating the lands which became theirs by the late law of partition This caused still greater disturbances than before the senate assembled upon this occasion in order to consult the most proper methods of securing these riches to themselves which they now valued above the safety of the commonwealth they had numemerous dependants who were willing to give up liberty for plenty and ease these therefore were commanded to to be in readiness to intimidate the people who expected no such opposition and who were now attending to the harrangue of Tiberius Gracchus in the Capitol  Here as a clamour was raised by the clients of the great on one side and by the favourers of the law on the other Tiberius found his speech intirely interrupted and begged in vain to be attended to till at last raising his hand to his head to intimate that his life was in danger the partizans of the senate gave out that he wanted a diadem In consequence of this an universal uproar now spread itself through all ranks of people the corrupt part of the senate were of opinion that the consul should defend the commonwealth by force of arms but this prudent magistrate declining such violence Scipio Nasica kinsman to Gracchus rose up and preparing himself for the contest desired that all who would defend the dignity and the authority of the laws should follow him Upon this attended by a large body of senators and clients armed with clubs he went directly up to the Capitol striking down all who ventured to resist Gracchus perceiving by the tumult that his life was sought for endeavoured to fly and throwing aside his robe to expedite his escape attempted to get through the throng but happening to fall over a person already on the ground Saturinus one of his colleagues in the tribuneship who was of the opposite faction struck him dead with a piece of a seat and not less than three hundred of his hearers shared the same fate being killed in the tumult Nor  did the vengeance of the senate rest here but extended to numbers of those who seemed to espouse his cause many of them were put to death many were banished and nothing was omitted to inspire the people with an abhorrence for his pretended crimes  These dissensions though for a little while interrupted by a victory gained by Aristonicus bastard brother to the late king of Pergamus and pretender to his crown over the Roman consul Licinius Crassus were soon renewed again For Aristonicus being overthrown by Perpenna the consul then besieged in Stratonice and compelled by famine to surrender was after gracing the conqueror's triumph strangled in prison by order of the senate which afforded an opportunity to the people for renewing the former animosities headed by Caius Gracchus the brother of him who was slain  Caius Gracchus was but twentyone upon the death of his brother Tiberius and as he was too young to be much dreaded by the great so he was at first unwilling to incur their resentment by aims beyond his reach he therefore lived in retirement unseen and almost forgotten But while he thus seemed desirous of avoiding popularity he was employing his solitude in the study of eloquence which was the readiest means to obtain it at length when he  thought himself qualified to serve his country he offered himself candidate for the questorship to the army in Sardinia which he readily obtained His valour affability and temperance in this office was remarked by all The king of Numidia sending a present of corn to the Romans ordered his ambassadors to say that it was entirely as a tribute to the virtues of Caius Gracchus This the senate treated with scorn and ordered the ambassadors to be dismissed with contempt as ignorant barbarians which so inflamed the resentment of young Gracchus that he immediately came from the army to complain of the indignity thrown upon his reputation and to offer himself for tribune of the people It was then that the great found in this youth who had been hitherto neglected upon account of his age a more formidable antagonist than even his brother had been his eloquence against the calumnies which were laid to his charge exceeded whatever had been heard in Rome and his intrepidity in supporting his pretensions equalied the rest of his virtues Notwithstanding the warmest opposition from the senate he was declared tribune by a very large majority and he now prepared to run the same career which his brother had gone before him  His first effort was to have Popilius one of the most inveterate of his brother's enemies  cited before the the people who rather than stand the event of a trial chose to go into voluntary banishment He next procured an edict granting the freedom of the city to the inhabitants of Latium and soon after to all the people on that side the Alps He afterwards fixed the price of corn to a moderate standard and procured a monthly distribution of it among the people He then proceeded to an inspection into the late corruptions of the senate in which the whole body being convicted of bribery extortion and the sale of offices for at that time a total degeneracy seemed to have taken place a law was made transferring the power of judging corrupt magistrates from the senate to the knights which made a great alteration in the constitution The number of these officers thus placed as inspectors over the conduct of all the other magistrates of the state amounted to three hundred and they were chosen from among the friends of Gracchus Thus ever attentive to the good of the commonwealth he ordered the highways to be improved and adorned he caused public granaries to be built and stored with grain against times of scarcity and to give a pattern of justice to the people he caused large quantities of corn which Fabius the propraetor in Spain had extorted from his government and had presented as a largess to the people to be sold and the money remitted  to the injured owners In short on whatever side we view the character of this great man we shall find him just temperate wise active and seemingly born to restore the ancient simplicity of Rome However historians pretend to assert that all his aims were to extend his own power and that all his virtues were but the children of his ambition These assertions however do not seem verified in any of the actions of his life which they have recorded however it is not for the moderns to dispute with ancient historians upon characters of antiquity they knew best the men of their own times and perhaps have often condemned them in the gross for defects which they thought not worth while to mention in the detail  Gracchus by these means being grown not only very popular but very powerful in the state was become an object at which the senate aimed all their resentment At first they seemed to wait only till his tribuneship expired in order to wreck their vengeance with safety but contrary to their expectations he was chosen a second time to that office though without the least efforts on his side to get himself reelected They now therefore resolved to alter their method of proceeding and endeavoured to oppose his popularity by setting up a rival This was Drusus his colleague who seemed to go even beyond Gracchus in every proposal and being  secretly backed by the senate so far succeeded in his schemes as to divide the affections of the people The jealousy of Gracchus on this occasion quickly blazed out he treated his colleague with contempt and as the senate foresaw it caused a very powerful party of his former admirers now to declare against him But the greatest effort to undo him was yet in reserve For from the time of his return to Rome from Sardinia he had been elected one of the Triumviri an office which as I have mentioned before was appointed by his brother Tiberius to determine the quantity of land possessed by each individual in the state In this employment Gracchus shewed himself extremely assiduous and impressed with the same spirit of equality that inspired his brother endeavoured to regulate each man's possessions according to the Licinian law with inflexible justice Those who thought themselves aggrieved by his severity had recourse to Scipio Africanus for redress Scipio who had been long an enemy to this law was too sensible of the people's power to oppose it directly but proceeding with more art obtained a new officer to be chosen whose business it was to settle the claims of individuals amongst each other before those of the publick could be determined by the Triumviri For this purpose Tuditanus the consul was chosen who thus having a power of protracting  the wishedfor division of lands for a while seemed to bend assiduously to the business for which he was chosen However when he could no longer defer the settlement of the lands in question he pretended to be called off to quell an insurrection in one of the provinces and thus left the claims and the wishes of the people undecided An universal murmur now therefore rose against Scipio by whose arts the execution of the law was protracted and one of the tribunes even cited him to appear and give an account how Tiberius Gracchus came to be slain Scipio however disdained to answer the charge but went home as some thought to meditate a speech for the ensuing day but in the morning he was found dead in his bed and by a mark round his neck it appeared that he was strangled The death of this great man produced much suspicion against the leaders of the popular party but Gracchus particularly came in for the greatest share He however disdained to vindicate himself from a crime of which there were no proofs against him but willing to turn the thoughts of the people another way proposed the rebuilding of Carthage and peopling it from Rome This scheme was gladly embraced by the people and six thousand families with Gracchus at their head left the city in order to settle there However they had scarce begun to clear away the rubbish  when they were disturbed by several omens which to a superstitious people was sufficient to check the progress of every undertaking But much more powerful motives called Gracchus back to Rome for his enemies during his absence used all their art to blacken his character so that he found himself obliged to return in order to support his party and remove those prejudices which had been formed in the minds of the people to his disadvantage But he soon found the populace a faithless and unsteady support they began to withdraw all their confidence from him and to place it upon Drusus whose character was unimpeached It was in vain that he designed new laws in their favour and called up several of the inhabitants of the different towns of Italy to his support the senate ordered them all to depart Rome and even sent one stranger to prison whom Gracchus had invited to live with him and honoured with his table and friendship To this indignity was shortly after added a disgrace of a more fatal tendency for standing for the tribuneship a third time he was rejected it being supposed that the officers whose duty it was to make the  eturn were bribed to reject him though fairly chosen  The senate no sooner saw Gracchus reduced to a private station than they determined to destroy him and deputed Opimius the consul  who was his mortal enemy to be the instrument of their malignity against him The consul who beside the greatest pride was possessed of the utmost cruelty undertook the office with great readiness and first annulled those laws which were made for establishing a colony at Carthage He then proceeded to abrogate all the other laws which had been made during his two tribuneships and set a day for a general assembly of the people for that purpose  It was now seen that the fate of Gracchus was resolved on The consul was not contented with the protection of all the senate and the knights with a numerous retinue of slaves and clients but ordered a body of Candians that were mercenaries in the Roman service to follow and attend him Thus guarded and conscious of the superiority of his forces he insultted Gracchus wherever he met him doing all in his power to produce a quarrel in which he might have a pretence of dispatching his enemy in the fray Gracchus however avoided all recrimination and as if apprized of the consul's designs would not even wear any kind of arms for his defence His friend Flaccus however a zealous tribune was not so remiss but resolved to oppose party against party and for this purpose brought up several countrymen to Rome who came under a pretence of desiring employment  When the day for determining the controversy was arrived the two parties early in the morning attended at the Capitol where while the consul was sacrificing according to custom one of the lictors taking up the entrails of the beast that was slain in order to remove them could not forbear crying out to Fulvius and his party  "You ye factious citizens make way for honest men"  This insult so provoked the party to whom it was addressed that they instantly fell upon him and pierced him to death with the instruments they used in writing which they then happened to have in their hands This murder caused a great disturbance in the assembly but particularly Gracchus who saw the consequences that were likely to ensue reprimanded his party for giving his enemies such advantage over him he made many attempts to speak but could not be heard by reason of the tumult wherefore he was at last obliged to retire homewards and wait the event As he was going through the Forum he stopped before a statue that was raised to his father's memory and regarding it for some time he burst into a flood of tears as if deploring the spirit of the times His followers were not less moved than he and all joining in the sorrow vowed never to abandon a man whose only crime was his affection to his country In the mean time the senate took every  method to allarm the city and encrease their apprehensions of the danger The consul was directed that the commonwealth should receive no injury by which form they invested him upon this slight occasion with absolute and uncontroulable power The dead lictor's corse was carried in triumph through the streets and exposed to view before the senatehouse and the whole body of the nobles received orders to be in arms the next day with their slaves and dependants upon Mount Aventine On the other side Flaccus was sedulously employed in getting together the remains of his shattered partisans but it was not at present as in the former commotions of the commonwealth when the plebeians were to be excited agaist the patricians for those distinctions were long broken down it was now only an opposition between the poor and the rich and the depressed party were of consequence timorous and unconnected as if already humbled by their imperious masters Gracchus who easily foresaw his weakness was however resolved not to abandon his friends though he knew them to be unable to resist his opponents Notwithstanding he refused to go armed as the rest but taking his usual robe and a short dagger for his defence in case of being attacked he prepared to lead his followers to Mount Aventine It was there he learned that proclamation had  been made by the consuls that whoever should bring either his head or that of Flaccus should receive its weight in gold for the reward It was to no purpose that he sent the youngest son of Flaccus who was yet a child with proposals for an accommodation The senate and the consuls who were sensible of their superiority rejected all his offers and resolved to punish his offence with nothing less than his death and in order to weaken his party they offered pardon to all who should leave him immediately This produced the desired effect the people fell from him by degrees and left him with very inferior forces He now therefore resolved to wait upon the senate in person but his friends would not permit him through an apprehension of losing their commander The child of Flaccus was therefore sent once more to demand peace but Opimius the consul who thirsted for slaughter ordered it to prison and leading his forces up to Mount Aventine fell in among the crowd with ungovernable fury A terrible slaughter of the scarce resisting multitude ensued not less than three thousand citizens were slain upon the spot Flaccus attempted to find shelter in a ruinous cottage but being discovered was slain with his eldest son Gracchus at first retired to the temple of Diana where he was resolved to die by his own hand but was prevented by two  of his faithful friends and followers Pomponius and Licinius who forced him to seek safety by flight From thence he made the best of his way in order to cross a bridge that led from the city still attended by his two generous friends and a Grecian slave whose name was Philocrates But his pursuers still pressed upon him from behind and when come to the foot of the bridge he was obliged to turn and face the enemy His two friends were soon slain defending him against the crowd and he forced with his slave into a grove beyond the Tyber which had long been dedicated to the Furies Here finding himself surrounded on every side and no way left of escaping he prevailed upon his slave to kill him who immediately after killed himself and fell down dead upon the body of his beloved master The pursuers soon coming up cut off the head of Gracchus and placed it for a while as a trophy upon a spear Soon after one Septimuleius carrying it home first having secretly taken out the brain filled it with lead in order to make it weigh the heavier and thus received of the consul seventeen pounds of gold as his recompence  Thus died Caius Gracchus about ten years after his brother Tiberius and six after he began to be active in the commonwealth He is usually impeached by historians as guilty of sedition but from what we see of his character  the disturbance of public tranquility was rather owing to his opposers than to him so that instead of calling the tumults of that time the sedition of the Gracchi we should rather call them the sedition of the senate against the Gracchi since the efforts of the latter were made in vindication of a law to which the senate had assented and as the former were supported by a foreign armed power that had never before meddled in the business of legislation and whose introduction at that time gave a most irrecoverable blow to the constitution Whether the Gracchi were actuated by motives of ambition or of patriotism in the promulgation of these laws it is impossible to determine but certain it is from what appears that all justice was on their side and all injury on that of the senate In fact this body was now quite changed from that venerable assembly which we have seen overthrowing Pyrrhus and Hannibal as much by their virtues as their arms They were now only to be distinguished from the rest of the people by their superior luxuries and ruled the commonwealth by the weight of that authority which is gained from riches and a number of mercenary dependancies All the venal and the base were attached to them from motives of selfinterest and they who still ventured to be independant were borne down and entirely lost in the infamous majority In short  the empire at this period came under the government of an hateful aristocracy the tribunes who were formerly accounted protectors of the people becoming rich themselves and having no longer opposite interests from those of the senate concurred in their oppressions since as has been said it was not now the struggle between patricians and plebeians who only nominally differed but between the rich and the poor The lower orders of the state being by these means reduced to a degree of hopeless subjection instead of looking after liberty only sought for a leader while the rich with all the suspicion of tyrants terrified at the slightest appearance of opposition entrusted men with uncontroulable power from whom they had not strength to withdraw it when the danger was over Thus both parts of the state concurred in giving up their freedom the fears of the senate first made the dictator and the hatred of the people kept him in his office Nothing can be more dreadful to a thinking mind than the government of Rome from this period till it  ound refuge under the protection of Augustus  CHAP XIX From the sedition of Gracchus to the perpetual dictatorship of Sylla which was the first step towards the ruin of the commonwealth of Rome  WHILE the Romans were in this state of deplorable corruption at home they nevertheless were very successful in their transactions with regard to foreign powers The senate though corrupt fathers of the commonwealth were skillful conductors of the empire so that Rome while she was losing liberty was every day gaining new territories The Bal  aric Islands were subdued The Allobroges who inhabited the country now called Savoy were conquered by Domitius Aenobarbus and annexed to the empire Gallia Narbonensis was also reduced into a province The Scordici a  people inhabiting Thrace though at first successful were at last overcome and Jugurtha king of Numidia was totally overthrown the war with this monarch having been related by the most elegant historian of antiquity makes it incumbent upon us to give it greater room in this general picture of history than the importance of the subject might seem to demand  Jug  ha was grandson to the famous Massinissa who sided against Hannibal with Rome He was educated with the two young princes who were left to inherit the kingdom and being superior in abilities to both and greatly in favour with the people he murdered Hiempsal the eldest son and attempted the same by Adherbal the younger who made his escape and fled to the Romans for succour Whereupon Jugurtha being sensible how much avarice and injustice had crept into the senate sent his ambassadors with large presents to Rome who so successfully prevailed that the senate decreed him half the kingdom which he had thus acquired by murder and usurpation and sent ten commissioners to divide it between him and Adherbal The commissioners of whom Opimius the murderer of Gracchus was one willing to follow the example which the senate had set them were also bribed to bestow the most rich and populous part of the kingdom upon the usurper who however resolved to possess himself of the whole But willing to give a colour to his ambition he only made in the beginning incursions upon his colleague's territories in order to provoke reprisals which he knew how to convert into seeming aggression in case it came before the senate This however failing he resolved to throw off the mask and besieging Adherbal in Cirta his capital he at length got him into his power and  murdered him The people of Rome  ho had still some generosity remaining unanimously complained of this treachery the senate only who had been bribed to silence continued for a while in suspense However a consul was sent at last with a powerful army to oppose him but he being also infected with the avarice of the times suffered himself to be bribed and suspending his operations made overtures for peace The people therefore now more enraged than before procured a decree that Jugurtha should be summoned in person before them upon the public faith of the state in order to give an account of all such as had accepted bribes Jugurtha made no great difficulty in throwing himself upon the clemency of Rome and soon after appeared before the people in an imploring manner and in a dress corresponding with his situation However instead of discovering those who were bribed he only set about renewing the evil complained of and being sensible that all opinions were venal at Rome without much endeavouring to influence any by the justice of his cause he took the more certain method of interesting them by the distribution of  is riches Wherefore when brought to be examined by the people concerning his unjust method of obtaining the protection of the magistrates who were sent to oppose him Bebius one of the tribunes who had been himself corrupted  enjoined him silence so that the longwishedfor discovery was protracted The people thus seeing no hopes of exposing and punishing their corrupt magistrates put no bounds to their resentment and conceived an implacable enmity against the senate which as it was just was the more lasting In the mean time Jugurtha being ordered to quit Rome obeyed However he could not repress a sarcasm against its venality as he took leave for looking back upon the city as he past through one of the gates  "O Rome cried he how readily wouldst thou sell thyself if there were any man rich enough to be the purchaser"  As he had come to Rome upon the faith of the state so that protected him till he arrived at his own dominions but in the mean time Albinus the consul was sent with an army to follow him The first operations of the Roman general were attended with success and Jugurtha finding his own inability to oppose him in the field set about circumventing him in the cabinet New proposals for peace were made on his side he was every day offering himself up as a prisoner and yet every day securing his power in the state Albinus thus saw himself perplexed by treaties which he could not comprehend and the time of his command almost insensibly elapsed without having struck any important blow Being obliged to return to attend the election of magistrates  at Rome he left the direction of the army to Aulus his brother a person every way unqualified for the command His avarice induced him to lay siege to Suthul a place almost impregnable by nature and only inviting the enemy because it contained the treasure of the king Jugurtha conscious of the strength of the place suffered Aulus to amuse himself before it and at one time pretending fear at another offering terms of accommodation but still lavishing his bribes even to the meanest centurion he led his antagonist into such straits that he was compelled to hazard a battle upon disadvantageous terms and his whole army to avoid being cut to pieces was obliged to pass under the yoke In this condition Metellus the succeeding consul found affairs upon his arrival in Numidia Officers without confidence an army without discipline and an enemy ever watchful and ever intriguing However by his great attention to business and by an integrity that shuddered at corruption he soon began to retrieve the affairs of Rome and the credit of the army In the space of two years Jugurtha was overthrown in several battles forced out of his own dominions and constrained to beg a peace This Metellus offered to grant upon condition that he should first deliver up his elephants and arms With this the Numidian prince complied and they were delivered up  accordingly He was then commanded to pay two hundred thousand pound weight of silver to defray the war this was immediately paid down The deserters were next ordered to be given up this too was complied with At length the Roman general insisted that Jugurtha should come and surrender in person and put himself upon his trial at Rome With this he refused to comply and thus the treaty being broken both sides resolved once more to tempt the hazards of the war All things however promised Metellus an easy and a certain victory the enemy was almost entirely subdued few cities remained that could make resistance and all the wiles of the Numidian were exhausted with his treasures It only remained towards concluding the war in triumph that Metellus should be chosen consul once more but in this he was disappointed and another general came in to reap that harvest of glory which his industry had sown This was Caius Marius who had been sent with him as his lieutenant in the war This commander who became afterwards the glory and the scourge of Rome was born in a village near Arpinium of poor parents who gained their living by their labour As he had been bred up in a participation of their toils his manners were as rude as his countenance was frightful He was a man of extraordinary stature incomparable strength and undaunted  bravery He entered early into the service of his country and was from the beginning remarkable for his exact observance of discipline and his implicit obedience to those in command He sought upon every occasion dangers equal to his courage the longest marches and the most painful fatigues of war were easy to one bred up in penury and labour He was not more averse to the allurements of pleasure from habit than by nature He took all occasions to inspire temperance by his example eat the same bread which was distributed to the meanest centinel lay upon the ground dressed in the coarsest garments and seemed dead to every other passion but that of ambition and revenge He had already passed through the meaner gradations of office and each seemed conferred on him as the reward of some signal exploit When he stood for the office of military tribune though his person was unknown his actions were in the mouths of the multitude When elected to that charge his general found his merit and assistance so great that he seconded him with his interest in procuring him to be made a tribune of the people It was in this station that his ambition began to appear and his thorough detestation of the senate whose vices indeed deserved his reproaches became conspicuous Not to be intimidated by their threats he boldly arraigned their corruption  even in the senatehouse and when Metellus who till then had patronized and raised him disapproved his zeal he even threatened to commit him to prison However being afterwards sent under him as his lieutenant into Numidia Metellus preferred the interest of his country to private resentment and trusted Marius with the most important concerns of the war This confidence was not misplaced Marius acquitted himself in every action with such prudence and resolution that he was considered at Rome as second in command but first in experience and resolution It was in this situation of affairs that Metellus as has been said was obliged to sollicit at Rome for a continuation of his command but Marius whose ambition knew no bounds was resolved to obtain it for himself and thus gain all the glory of putting an end to the war To that end he privately inveighed against Metellus by his emissaries at Rome He insinuated among the people that the war was prolonged only to lengthen out the consul's command and asserted that he was able with half the army to make Jugurtha a prisoner engaging also in a single campaign to bring him dead or alive to Rome By such professions as these having excited a spirit of discontent against Metellus he had leave granted him to go to Rome to stand for the consulship himself  which he obtained contrary to the expectation and interest of the nobles  Marius being thus invested with the supreme power of managing the war shewed himself every way fit for the commission His vigilance was equal to his valour and he quickly made himself master of the cities which Jugurtha had yet remaining in Numidia This unfortunate prince finding himself unable to make opposition singly was obliged to have recourse for assistance to Bocchus king of Mauritania to whose daughter he was married A battle soon after ensued in which the Numidians surprized the Roman camp by night and gained a temporary advantage However it was but of short continuance for Marius soon after overthrew them in two signal engagements in one of which not less than ninety thousand of the African army were slain Bocchus now finding the Romans too powerful to be resisted did not think it expedient to hazard his own crown to protect that of his ally he therefore determined to make peace upon whatever conditions he might obtain it and accordingly sent to Rome imploring its protection and friendship The senate received the ambassadors with their usual haughtiness and without complying with their request granted the suppliants not their friendship but their pardon However they were  given to understand that the delivering up of Jugurtha to the Romans would in some measure conciliate their favour and soften their resentment At first the pride of Bocchus struggled against such a proposal but a few interviews with Sylla who was quaestor to Marius reconciled him to this treacherous measure At length therefore Jugurtha was given up being drawn into an ambuscade by the specious pretences of his ally who deluded him by desiring a conference and he was brought over by Marius to Rome He did not long survive his overthrow being condemned by the senate to be starved to death in prison a short time after he had adorned the triumph of the conqueror His own cruelty in some measure deserved this fate but they must be doubly cruel who could thus oblige a prisoner whom they resolved to put to death to encrease the splendor of a procession and thus find delight in his distress  This victory over Jugurtha had been scarce obtained when news was brought to Rome that immense numbers of barbarians from the north were pouring down into the Roman dominions and were threatening Italy itself with slaughter and desolation Marius was now looked upon as the only person who could oppose them and he was accordingly made consul a second time contray to the constitutions of the state which required an interval of ten years  between each consulship The people he was to oppose were the Cimbri and Teutones who left their forests to the number of three hundred thousand men in order to seek new habitations in the fruitful vallies of Italy They had some time before invaded Gaul where they had committed great ravages and defeated many Roman armies that were sent against them Marius however was entirely successful He at first declined fighting till their force was weakened by delay but afterwards engaging  them as they were passing the Alps in three seperate bodies a bloody battle ensued which lasted two days In this the Romans were victorious and Theutobocchus the king of the Teutones taken prisoner with the loss of an hundred and fifty thousand men But though the Teutones were thus utterly destroyed the army of the Cimbri still remained entire and had actually past the Alps after having put Catulus the Roman consul to flight Marius however being made consul a fifth time for the people had continued him in office during the former part of the war met and gave them a  dreadful overthrow An hundred and forty thousand of these barbarians were slain and sixty thousand taken prisoners Their wives during the engagement fought furiously in chariots and at last when they saw the fortune of the field  decided slew their children and then with desperate intrepidity destroyed each other  Marius by these victories having become very formidable to distant nations in war became soon after much more dangerous to his fellow citizens in peace Metellus from being his first patron and promoter was long grown hateful to him for his superior influence in the senate so that he earnestly wished to have him banished from Rome To effect this he employed one Saturninus who had unjustly possessed himself of the tribuneship to prefer a law for the partition of such lands as had been recovered in the late war and to oblige the senators to take a solemn oath for putting it into execution in case it was past The law was soon enacted by the interest of Marius but when the senate came to confirm the observance of it Metellus who considered it as a renewal of the ancient disturbances that had been so fatal to the constitution endeavoured to persuade them to reject the measure with disdain At first they seemed inclined to come into his advice but the influence of his rival being superior they were content to swear and Metellus refusing was obliged to go into voluntary exile He was received with great respect by all the cities through which he passed and taking up his residence in the Island of Rhodes he there seemed to forget that he was great and only studied to be happy  This success only served to encrease the arrogance of Saturninus Being made tribune a third time he filled the city with clamour and and commotion Memmius who was of the opposite party was killed in one of these frays as he canvassed for the consulship and Glaucius the praetor was tumultuously chosen in his stead This seemed as a signal for a general encounter The senate seemed resolved to curb the insolence of the tribunes the consuls were ordered as in dangerous times to provide for the safety of the commonwealth and Marius who was one of them found himself in the disagreeable situation of heading a strong body of the senators and patricians against those very people whom his own intrigues had put into commotion Saturninus and his followers were forced into the capitol where for want of water they were compelled to yield after Marius had passed his word for their safety But he was now unable to protect them a large body of Roman knights broke into the Forum and cut them to pieces while the prevailing party elate with their success recalled Metellus from exile  Marius being thus doubly mortified by the demolition of his party and the revocation of his rival left Rome under pretence of performing a vow but in reality with hopes of kindling up new wars in Asia in which only his military talents could have room for display  With this view he went to the court of Mithridates at that time the most powerful monarch of the East hoping either to be dismissed with scorn or received with hospitality In either case he expected to find his account if dismissed it would give a colour for declaring war against him if received he would be in a better condition to judge of the strength of his enemy Mithridates received him with great kindness and dismissed him loaden with presents to Rome  In the mean time the strength which Marius had given the popular party was not to be destroyed by a single blow Drusus the tribune whom we have seen opposing the popularity of Gracchus seemed now determined to pursue his example This wellmeaning man finding the senators displeased with the judicial power which had been consigned over to the knights and perceiving the latter also making a very tyrannical use of their authority he conceived a design of conciliating both by restoring the senate to its ancient privileges and raising a large number of the equestrian order into that body However what he expected would please both was disliked by all the senate was against having their number enlarged the knights were averse to losing their privileges and the people were displeased at having the law of Gracchus brought into danger In order therefore to  gain that popularity which he found he had lost by this measure he once again threatened the great with the revival of the Licinian law and that the allies and confederates of Italy who were the present possessors might share an equivalent to what this law was likely to deprive them of he gave them hopes of being admitted to the freedom of Rome These promises did not fail to produce their effect the Latin towns now began to look upon him as their protector and came in vast crowds to the city to support him Great contentions arose in consequence of his endeavours Deliberation had now been long banished from the assemblies of the people the whole of their laws were enacted or rejected by clamour violence and sedition On one of these occasions Drusus being warmly engaged in promoting the law for enlarging the freedom of the city he was stabbed by an unknown person who left his poignard in the wound Drusus had just strength enough to avow with his dying breath the integrity of his intentions and that there was no man in the commonwealth more sinecrely attached to its interests than he  The Italians being thus frustrated in their aims of gaining the freedom of Rome by the death of Drusus resolved upon obtaining by force what the senate seemed to refuse them as a favour This gave rise to the Social war  in which most of the states of Italy entered into a confederacy against Rome in order to obtain a redress of this and all the rest of their grievances Messengers and hostages were privately sent and interchanged amongst them and upon having their claims rejected by the senate they soon broke out into open rebellion The state now saw an hundred thousand of its own soldiers converted against itself led on by excellent commanders and disciplined in the Roman manner To oppose these an equal body was raised by the senate and the conduct of the war committed to the consuls together with Marius Sylla and the most experienced generals of the time The war commenced with great animosity on either side but the Romans seemed to have the worst of it in the beginning Rutilius the consul fell into an ambuscade and was slain His body being carried into the city so discouraged the people that the senate decreed that thenceforward the bodies of the slain should be buried where they fell Upon this defeat the army which he conducted was given to Marius who rather might be said not to forfeit his ancient fame than to acquire new reputation by his conduct during the present command  After a lapse of two years this war having continued to rage with doubtful success the senate began to reflect that whether conquere  or conquerors the power of Rome was in danger of being totally destroyed In order therefore to soften their compliance by degrees they began by giving the freedom of the city to such of the Italian states as had not revolted They then offered it to such as would soonest lay down their arms This unexpected bounty had the desired effect the allies with mutual distrust offered each a separate treaty the senate took them one by one into favour but gave the freedom of the city in such a manner that being empowered to vote not untill all the other tribes had given their suffrages they had very little weight in the constitution In this manner they were made free all but the Samnites and Lucanians who seemed excluded from the general compromise as if to leave Sylla who commanded against them the glory of putting an end to the war this he performed with great conduct storming their camps overthrowing them in several battles and obliging them to submit to such terms as the senate were pleased to impose  This destructive war being concluded which as Paterculus says consumed above three hundred thousand of the flower of Italy the senate now began to think of turning their arms against Mithridates the most powerful and warlike monarch of the East This prince whose dominions were chiefly composed of the  provinces he had conquered was master of Cappadocia Bythinia Thrace Macedon and all Greece He was able to bring two hundred and fifty thousand infantry into the field and fifty thousand horse He had a vast number of armed chariots and in his ports four hundred ships of war Such power joined to so great riches served only the more to invite the ambition of Rome they but desired a pretence for a war which was not long wanting The pretext was his having invaded and overcome many states that were in alliance with and under the protection of Rome his having procured Tigranes king of Armenia to declare war against the Romans together with his continually upbraiding the Roman state with avarice and corruption Such were the motives that induced them to declare war against this king it only remained to chuse a general properly qualified to conduct the expedition  Marius was the most experienced commander and ardently wished to go but Sylla was just chosen consul and had obtained this dignity as a recompence for his services in the Social war his fame now therefore began to equal that of Marius and he was with general consent appointed to conduct the Asiatic war This general who now began to take the lead in the commonwealth was born of a patrician family one of the most illustrious in Rome  his person was elegant his air noble his manners easy and apparently sincere he loved pleasure but glory still more his duty still commanded him from sensual delights which however he never declined when he could enjoy them with safety he desired to please all the world for which purpose he talked of himself with modesty and of every body else with the highest commendations he was liberal to all and even prevented those requests which modesty hesitated to make stooping even to an acquaintance with the meanest soldiers whose manners he sometimes imitated to gain their affections In short he was a Proteus who could adapt himself to the inclinations pursuits follies or the wisdom of those he conversed with while he had no character of his own except that of being a complete dissembler His first rise was to be quaestor or treasurer of the army under Marius in Numidia where by his courage and dexterity he contributed greatly to obtain those advantages which ensued and it was he particularly who persuaded Bocchus to give up Jugurtha He was afterwards chosen proconsul in the Social war where his actions entirely eclipsed those of every other commander and he was in consequence of them now appointed to the government of Asia Minor a post which as it promised an  immense harvest of glory and riches was earnestly sought after by Marius  There were two incentives to the jealousy of Marius at finding Sylla thus preferred to conduct this war before him The honours which were likely to be obtained there and the former pains he had taken to prepare himself for that expedition He therefore began to consider this preference as an unjust partiality in favour of his rival and a tacit insult upon all his former victories He could not help thinking that his reputation deserved the first offer in all the employments of the state and he concluded upon depriving Sylla of his new command To this end he gained over to his interest one Sulpicius a tribune of the people but chiefly noted for his enmity to Sylla a man equally eloquent and bold of great riches but corrupt manners and rather dreaded than esteemed by the people The first effect of the conjunction of these ambitious men was to gain over the Italian towns to their party and for this purpose they preferred a law that these should vote not in the rear of the other tribes but that they should be indiscriminately possessed of all the same advantages This law was as warmly opposed by the citizens of Rome as it was resolutely defended by Marius and Sulpicius and the states of Italy A tumult ensued as usual in which many were slain on one side and the other This  had been scarcely appeased when another assembly of the people was proposed for passing the law contrary to the command of the consuls This produced a more violent commotion than even the former in which Sylla's soninlaw who attempted to oppose the law was slain nor was Sylla himself in less danger for being pursued by the multitude he was at last obliged to take refuge in the house of his enemy Marius who though naturally vindictive would not break the laws of hospitality which were still reverenced in Rome Having thus found means of escaping their fury and finding the opposite faction prevail he instantly quitted Rome and went to the army which he had commanded during the Social war and which was appointed to go under him upon the expedition into Asia In the mean time Marius and Sulpicius drove their scheme forward without any opposition the law for giving the Italians a full participation of the freedom of the city was past without trouble and by the same law it was enacted that the command of the army which was to oppose Mithridates was to be transferred from Sylla to Marius  In consequence of this Marius immediately sent down officers from Rome to take command in his name But Sylla as was mentioned above had predisposed the army in his own favour They were troops with whom he had  gained signal victories and they were entirely devoted to his command Instead therefore of obeying the orders of Marius they fell upon and slew his officers and then entreated their general that he would lead them directly to take signal vengeance upon all his enemies at Rome In the mean time Marius being informed of this was not slow in making reprisals upon such of Sylla's friends as fell into his hands in the city This produced new murmurs in Sylla's camp the army insisted upon being led to the capital and their general himself who was naturally vindictive at length determined to comply  Sylla's army amounted to six legions the soldiers of which seemed animated with the resentment of their leader and breathed nothing but slaughter and revenge However there were a few yet remaining among them that even in this time of general corruption could not think of turning their arms upon their native city but quitted the camp and fled Thus a strange migration of different parties was seen some flying from Rome to avoid the resentment of Marius and others deserting from the camp not to be accomplices in the guilt of Sylla Still however the army advanced toward Rome it was to no purpose that the praetors went out from the city in form to retard them they broke the ensigns  of their office and tore their purple robes with derision The senate next sent deputies to command the army not to advance within five miles of the city The deputies were for a while amused by Sylla however they seemed scarce returned to give an account of their commission when he arrived with all his forces at the very gates of Rome His soldiers entered the city sword in hand as into a place taken by storm Marius and Sulpicius at the head of a tumultuary body of their partizans attempted to oppose their entrance and the citizens themselves who feared the saccage of the place threw down stones and tyles from the tops of the houses upon the soldiers So unequal a conflict lasted longer than could have been expected but at length Marius and his party were obliged to seek safety by flight after having vainly offered liberty to all the slaves who should assist them in this emergency  Sylla now finding himself master of the city placed bodies of soldiers in different parts to prevent pillage and disorder He even punished some severely for offering to enter the houses by force and spent the night in visiting their quarters and restraining their impetuosity The next morning he began by modelling the laws so as to favour his outrages These had long lost their force in the commonwealth and were now molded into whatever form the strongest  party were pleased they should assume He therefore reversed all the decrees which had been passed by Sulpicius He enacted that no law should be proposed for the future but what should be previously approved by the senate That the suffrages should be given by classes in which the patricians were sure of a majority and not by tribes in which every man having an equal voice the influence of the great was totally annihilated To these he added a decree whereby Marius Sulpicius and ten other leading men were declared enemies to their country and by which it was lawful for any person to kill them Having thus brought the laws to second his ambition he caused the goods of the proscribed to be confiscated and next sent troops into all parts to apprehend them Marius escaped but Sulpicius was found hidden in the marshes of Laurentium and his head being cut off was carried and fixed upon the Rostrum at Rome Sylla having thus as he supposed entirely restored peace to the city departed upon his expedition against Mithridates hoping to give new vigour to his designs by the wealth and honours which he expected to reap in the East  But while Sylla was thus establishing his party against Marius he had been inattentive to a very formidable opponent who was daily growing into popularity and power at Rome This  was Cornelius Cinna who was born of a patrician family but strongly attached to the people from motives of ambition He was a man eager after glory but incapable of patiently expecting its regular approach rash hot and obstinate but at the same time bold and courageous he was willing to become the leader of the people as he could not lead in the senate He therefore offered himself for the consulship in opposition to the interests of Sylla and either from that general's inattention to one he despised or from his own great favour with the lower part of the people he obtained it He was scarce invested with his new dignity but his enmity broke forth he boasted that he would annul all the laws which had been lately made in favour of the patricians and accordingly began by endeavours to attach the Italians firmly to his interest This was only to be effected by giving them an equal participation in the freedom of the city of which Sylla had lately deprived them He therefore sent private emissaries among the country states desiring their attendance at Rome upon a certain day and enjoining them also to carry swords under their robes Thus when he had prepared a party to support his pretensions he publickly proposed the law for suppressing the new Italian tribes and for giving them equal privileges with the rest by mixing them among  those formerly established To propose a law at this time was in some meausure to declare a war An engagement ensued in which the Italians being previously armed came off victorious for a while but Octavius the other consul coming with a powerful body of Sylla's friends to oppose them soon turned the fortune of the day and obliged the Italians to quit the city  Cinna being thus defeated in his purpose of passing the law had notwithstanding the pleasure of finding all the states of Italy strongly united in his favour whereupon leaving Rome he went from city to city declaring against the tyranny of the great and their injustice to their allies by whose assistance they had become so powerful he allured them with fresh hopes of equal privileges with the Romans and excited their pity towards himself whose sufferings had been incurred for his assiduity in their cause Having thus induced them to a general insurrection he began to make levies both of troops and money thus a powerful army was soon raised and Cinna as being consul of Rome without opposition was placed at its head In the mean time the senate who were apprized of these violent proceedings went through the forms of justice against him Being summoned to take his trial and not appearing he was degraded from his  rank as a citizen tured out of his office of consul and Lucius Merula the priest of Jupiter elected in his stead But these indignities only served to encrease his diligence and animosity He appeared before a body of the Roman forces that were encamped at Capua in an humble imploring manner without any of the ensigns of his office He entreated them with tears and protestations not to suffer the people of Rome to fall a sacrifice to the tyranny of the great he invoked the gods who punished injustice to witness to the rectitude of his intentions and so far prevailed upon the soldiers that they unanimously resolved to support his cause The whole army with general consent agreed to nominate him consul and contrary to the decree of the senate invested him with the ensigns of his office and then taking the oaths of allegiance they determined to follow him to Rome Thus he saw his strength encreasing every day several of the senators who were wavering before now came over to his side but what was equal to an army in itself Tidings were brought that Marius escaping from a thousand perils was with his son upon the road to join him  We have already seen this formidable general driven out of Rome and declared a public enemy we have seen him at the age of seventy after numberless victories and six consulships  obliged to save himself unattended and on foot from the numerous pursuits of those who sought his life After having wandered for some time in this deplorable condition he found every day his dangers encrease and his pursuers making nearer advances In this distress he was obliged to conceal himself in the marshes of Minturnum where he spent the night up to his chin in a quagmire At break of day he left this dismal place and made towards the sea side in hopes of finding a ship to facilitate his escape but being known and discovered by some of the inhabitants he was conducted to a neighbouring town with an halter round his neck and without cloaths and thus covered over with mud he was sent to prison The governor of the place willing to conform to the orders of the senate soon after sent a Cimbrian slave to dispatch him but the barbarian no sooner entered the dungeon for this purpose but he stopt short intimidated by the dreadful visage and awful voice of this fallen general who sternly demanded if he he had the presumption to kill Caius Marius The slave unable to reply threw down his sword and rushing back from the prison cried out that he found it impossible to kill him The governor considering the fear of the slave as an omen in the unhappy exile's favour gave him once more his freedom and commending him to his fortune  provided him with a ship to convey him from Italy He from thence made the best of his way to the island of Aenaria and sailing onward was forced by a tempest upon the coast of Sicily Here a Roman quaestor who happened to be at the same place resolved to seize him by which he lost sixteen of his crew who were killed in their endeavours to cover his retreat to the ship He afterwards landed in Africa near Carthage and went in a melancholy manner to place himself among the ruins of that desolated place He soon however had orders from the praetor who governed there to retire Marius who remembered his having once served this very man when in necessity could not suppress his sorrow at finding ingratitude in every quarter of the world and preparing to obey desired the messenger to tell his master that he had seen Marius sitting among the ruins of Carthage intimating the greatness of his own fall by the desolation that was round him He then embarked once more and not knowing where to land without encountering an enemy he spent the winter at sea expecting every hour the return of a messenger from his son whom he had sent to sollicit protection from an African prince whose name was Mandrastal After long expectation instead of the messenger his son himself arrived having escaped from the inhospitable court of  that monarch where he had been kept not as a friend but a prisoner and had returned just time enough to prevent his father from sharing the same rate It was in this situation that they were informed of the activity of Cinna in their favour and accordingly made the best of their way to join him  Cinna upon being apprized of their approach sent his lictors with all other marks of distinction to join them but Marius would not accept of these instances of respect he sent them back as being ill suited to his abject situation and affected to appear in the wretched habit which he had worn in his misfortunes His beard was long and neglected his pace slow and solemn and all his actions shewed a mind stung into resentment and meditating revenge he now therefore went among the towns exciting them to espouse his quarrel which he taught them to think was their own Five hundred of the principal citizens of Rome went down to congratulate his return a large number of veterans who had fought under his standard came to offer him their service and to encrease his forces still more he proclaimed freedom to all slaves who should join him by which means great crowds flocked to him from every quarter His first operation was to take the city of Ostia by storm he then advanced with his whole army and posted himself  upon the Janiculum an hill that overlooked Rome where he was joined by Cinna with an army as numerous as his own and both now resolved to lay siege to their native city  The senate and consuls were now driven almost to despair it was too late to send to Sylla who was gaining victories in Asia while his party was upon the brink of ruin at home Cneius Pompeius commanded an army near Rome but his actions were so equivocal that neither side could rely upon him while both equally feared him They sent to Metellus then lying with a body of troops among the Samnites but his soldiers instead of granting them any aid soon after joined with Marius Thus deserted by all they daily saw the towns about the city taken and plundered and vast numbers of slaves every hour deserting over to the enemy In this exigence they had no other resource but submission they accordingly resolved to send ambassadors to the two generals assuring them of their ready attachment and desiring them to enter the city peaceably and to spare their own countrymen Cinna however refused to grant any audience till he knew in what manner he was to be addressed whether as a private man or as consul and first officer of the state This for a while created some embarrassment but it was vain to deliberate when submission was the only alternative Cinna  being restored to the consulship now received the ambassadors of the senate in form who invited him into the city and requested him to undertake the duties of his office they entreated him to regard his countrymen with tenderness and endeavoured to obtain from him an oath that he would put no man to death but after a legal manner and conformable to the ancient usages of Rome Cinna refused the oath but promised that willingly he would not be the cause of any man's death During this conference Marius continued standing by the consul's tribunal observing a profound silence but his furious air and eyes glancing with fire were but too sure presages of the carnage he meditated within  The conference being ended Cinna and Marius presented themselves at the gates of the city at the head of their troops Cinna marched in first accompanied by his guards but Marius stopped and refused to enter alledging that having been banished by a public decree it was necessary to have another to authorize his return It was thus that he desired to give his meditated cruelties the appearance of justice and while he was about to destroy thousands to pretend an implicit veneration for the laws In pursuance of his desire an assembly of th  people being called they began to reverse hi  banishment but they had scarce gone throug  three of the tribes when incapable of containing his desire of revenge he entered the city at the head of his guards and massacred all who had ever been obnoxious to him without remorse or pity Octavius the consul was killed in his chair of office Merula who had been his colleague in the room of Cinna killed himself to avoid falling by the enemy Caius and Lucius Julius Serranus Lentulus Numitorius and Bebius all senators of the first rank were butchered in the streets their heads placed upon the rostrum and their bodies given to be devoured by dogs many more shared the same fate the satellites of Marius breathing slaughter and vengeance stabbed the fathers of families in in their own houses violated the chastity of matrons and carried away their children by force Several who sought to propitiate the tyrant's rage were murdered by his command in his presence many even of those who had never offended him were put to death and at last even his own officers never approached him but with terror Having in this manner punished his enemies he next abrogated all the laws which were made by his rival and then made himself consul with Cinna Thus gratified in his two favourite passions vengeance and ambition having once saved his country and now deluged it with blood at last as if willing to crown the pile of slaughter  which he had made with his own body he died the month after aged seventy not without suspicion of having hastened his end  In the mean time these accounts were brought to Sylla who was sent against Mithridates and who was performing many signal services against him That monarch having caused an hundred and fifty thousand Romans who were in his dominions to be slain in cold blood next sent his general Archelaus to oppose Sylla however he was defeated near Athens with the loss of an immense number of his forces Another battle ensued by which the Roman general recovered all the countries that had been usurped by Mithridates The loss of the king's fleet followed soon after so that both parties were now inclined to an accommodation Mithridates induced by his losses and Sylla by a desire of returning home to take vengeance on his enemies in Rome A peace was accordingly soon after concluded the principal articles of which were that Mithridates should defray the charges of the war and should be content with his own hereditary dominions  Thus having in less than three years brought the Asiatic war to an honourable period Sylla prepared for his return previously informing the senate by letter of all the great services he had done the state and the ungrateful return he had received from such as envied  his fortune adding a dreadful menace that he would soon be at the gates of Rome with a victorious and powerful army to take signal revenge upon his own enemies and those of the state The senate who were now to be considered rather as a party formed by Marius than as the independent protectors of Rome greatly dreaded the effects of Sylla's return they already anticipated the slaughters he was about to make and therefore sent to treat with him offering to comply with whatever terms he should propose provided he let them know the limits he intended to set to his resentment They even ordered Cinna who as we have observed before had been elected consul with Marius to discontinue his levies and join with them in deprecating Sylla's anger by timely submission Cinna however knew too well how little mercy he had to expect from his opponent and instead of obeying the senate returned them an evasive answer but in the mean time proceeded to raise forces and to oppose Sylla even in Asia by sending an army thither under pretence that what was acted against Mithridates hitherto was against the consent and without the authority of the senate For this purpose he dispatched a body of forces under the command of Valerius Flaccus his colleague in the consulship into Asia However as this leader was unexperienced in the field Fimbria an old  soldier of reputation was sent as his lieutenant with directions to correct by his experience the too great impetuosity of the general They soon however began to differ and the breach widening every day the consul thought proper to depose Fimbria from his command But all confidence and order was now lost in the military as well as in the civil departments of the state Fimbria instead of submitting to his superior brought his cause before the army a general mutiny ensued the consul attempted to escape but being discovered at the bottom of a well was dragged out and murdered by his own soldiers In the mean time Fimbria taking the command of the army led it against Mithridates over whom he gained a signal victory and might have compleated his triumph over that monarch but the same disobedience which he was guilty of to his own commander his soldiers practised against him for shortly after at Sylla's approach his troops all deserted to join their fellowcitizens in the other army so that Fimbria being thus left alone fled to the temple of Aesculapius in Pergamus where he fell upon his sword but the wound not proving mortal his slave dispatched him killing himself upon the body of his master  In the mean time the ill success of this army did not intimidate Cinna from making preparations to repel his opponent Being joined by  Carbo who was now elected in the room of Valerius who had been slain together with young Marius who inherited all the abilities and the ambition of his father he determined to send over part of the forces he had raised into Dalmatia to oppose Sylla before he entered Italy Some troops were accordingly embarked but these being dispersed by a storm the rest that had not yet put to sea absolutely refused to go Upon this Cinna quite furious at their disobedience rushed forward to persuade them to their duty However one of the most mutinous of the soldiers being struck by an officer and returning the blow he was apprehended for his crime This illtimed severity produced a tumult and a mutiny through the whole army and while Cinna did all he could to prevent or appease it he was run through the body by one of the crowd The army being thus deprived of their principal leader continued under Carbo who kept himself consul without a colleague for some time The next year's consuls being Urbanus and Scipio new levies were made and the affairs of the party seemed to wear a very favourable aspect It was not doubted but Sylla would take signal vengeance for his late injuries and do all in his power to suppress the late popular laws exacted in his absence all the lower part of the citizens therefore and the majority of the senate were against  him the one from principles of democracy the other through fear Thus a great concourse of people came from different part  of Italy to take part with the consuls who soon saw themselves at the head of an army superior to that of Sylla whose approach was so much dreaded by all  During these preparations Sylla was not less expeditious by long and forced marches in returning to his native country which he intended to deluge with blood Being arrived at Dy  cchium where he had prepared a fleet to convey him into Italy he harrangued his army before they embarked entreating that they would engage themselves by an oath to continue faithful to his cause This they unanimously consented to do and as an earnest of their sincerity offered him all the money which they had gained in their late expeditions towards supporting the expences of the war Sylla pleased at their alacrity refused their intended favours assuring them that they should soon share much greater rewards from his bounty than he had as yet been able to bestow and then embarking his troops landed them after a favourable passage at Bru  dusium in Italy  He had been scarce arrived there but the remains of that shattered party which had escaped the proscriptions of Marius came to join  him Metellus was the first with a large body of forces which he had collected in his way Marcus Crassus came with a supply as also Cethegus but of all the succours which he received none were more timely or pleasing than those which were brought him by Cneius Pompey afterwards surnamed the Great This commander though yet but twentythree began already to shew the dawnings of that ambition which afterwards shone with such lustre in the commonwealth Though at that time invested with no public character he found means to raise an army of three legions in Picaenum and to overthrow Brutus who commanded the troops of the opposite faction in that district This victory was also signalized by his killing the general of the Gaulish cavalry who opposed himself in single combat for which he was saluted with the highest marks of respect by Sylla who seemed to have a prescience of his future greatness  A civil war being thus determined upon and both parties being now advanced very near each other Sylla was willing to try how far the immense riches he brought with him from Asia were capable of shaking the enemies forces without a battle For this purpose he at first pretended to be averse to engaging and sent deputies to Scipio the consul who commanded against him with proposals for coming  to a treaty The consul who sought for nothing so much as peace very readily embraced his offers but desired time previously to confer with Urbanus his colleague upon a measure in which he was equally concerned This was all that Sylla desired for in the mean time a suspension of arms being agreed upon his soldiers went into the opposite camp displaying those riches which they had acquired in their expeditions and offering to participate with their fellowcitizens in case they changed their party The same motives that had prevailed on the soldiers of Fimbria to desert him now prevailed upon these to desert their general The whole army declared unanimously for Sylla and Scipio scarce knew that he was forsaken and deposed till he was informed of it by a party of the enemy who entering his tent made him and his son their prisoners Sylla however acted with great moderation towards him he would permit no injury to be done to the consul but employed all his arts to bring him over to his party After much entreaty finding him inflexible he generously gave him his freedom having previously obtained his promise not to command against him during the rest of his consulship  Sylla having succeeded so well in this instance resolved to try the same arts upon the army commanded by Norbanus the other consul He sent deputies to him desiring a conference  but the consul instructed by the disgrace of his colleague confined the deputies and marched directly against him hoping to come upon him by surprize An engagement ensued in which Sylla's men though attacked in disorder repaired by their courage what they wanted in regularity Norbanus lost seven thousand men and was obliged to take refuge in Capua with the remainder of his army  Italy now began to feel all the desolations and miseries of a declared civil war nor were the secret intrigues of corruption carried on by both parties with less perseverance and assiduity the emissaries of each were seen going diligently during the whole winter up and down among the states of Italy labouring by all the arts of bribery and persuasion to gain over forces to their cause Sylla was particularly versed in the business of seduction and vast sums of that money which had been plundered from the East went all over the country and even among the barbarous nations of Gaul to extend his interests On the other hand the Samnites to the number of forty thousand men declared in favour of Carbo his chief opposer who was now chosen consul a third time with young Marius of whom his party had formed great expectations The operations in the field which had been suspended during the winter opened with still greater vigour in the beginning of the  spring Marius at the head of twentyfive cohorts offered Sylla battle which this general knowing how the troops against him were predisposed readily accepted At first the fortune of the day seemed doubtful but just at that very period in which victory begins to waver a part of the troops of Marius which had been previously corrupted fled in disorder and thus decided the fate of the day Marius having vainly endeavoured to rally his troops was the last that fled and went to take refuge in Praeneste a strong city that was still stedfast in his cause Sylla closely pursued him there and invested the city on every side then having disposed his army in such a manner as that none of the defendants could escape and no forces could be thrown into the garrison from without he marched at the head of a detachment to Rome  The partizans of Marius having been apprized of his defeat abandoned the city with precipitation so that Sylla approached without resistance The inhabitants thinned by famine and all the terrors that attend a civil war opened their gates upon his arrival wherefore entering the Forum and assembling the people he reprimanded them for their infidelity However he exhorted them not to be dejected for he was still resolved to pardon and protect them He observed that he was obliged by the necessity of the times to take vigorous measures and that  none but their enemies and his own should suffer He then put up the goods of those that fled to sale and leaving a small garrison in the city returned to besiege his rival  Young Marius on the other hand made many attempts to raise the siege but all his designs were known to Sylla before they were put into execution Wherever his Sallies were pointed the peculiar attention of Sylla's lieutenant seemed to be directed there Thus frequently frustrated in his attempts to repress or at least to escape his besiegers he gave way to that resentment which was remarkable in his family and ascribing his detention to the treachery of Sylla's friends who pretended to remain neuter he sent orders to Rome to Brutus who was Praetor there to put all those senators to death whom he suspected to be in the interest of his rival With this cruel command Brutus immediately complied and many of the first rank among whom were Domitius Antistius and Scaevola were slain as they were leaving the senate Thus whatever faction was victorious Rome was still a miserable sufferer  Both factions thus exasperated to the highest degree and expecting no mercy on either part gave vent to their fury in several engagements The forces on the side of Marius were the most numerous but those of Sylla better united and more under subordination Carbo who commanded  an army for Marius in the field sent eight legions to Praeneste to relieve his colleague but they were met by Pompey in a defile who slew many of them and dispersed the rest Carbo joined by Urbanus soon after engaged Metellus but was overcome with the loss of ten thousand men slain and six thousand taken prisoners In consequence of this defeat Urbanus killed himself and Carbo fled to Africa where after wandering a long time he was at last delivered up to Pompey who to please Sylla ordered him to be beheaded Still however a numerous army of the Samnites were in the field headed by several Roman generals and by Telesinus who though a Samnite had shewn himself equal to the greatest commanders of the age These were joined by four legions commanded by Carianus who was still obstinately bent upon continuing the war These united were resolved to make one desperate effort to raise the siege of Praeneste or to perish in the attempt Accordingly Telesinus made a shew of advancing with great boldness to force the enemy's lines of circumvallation At the same time Sylla at the head of a victorious army faced him in front while orders were sent to Pompey to follow and attack him in the rear The Samnite general however shewed himself superior to both in these operations for judging of their designs by their motions he  led off his troops by night and by forced marches appeared next morning upon the mountains that overlooked Rome This wretched city had just time sufficient to shut its gates to prevent his entrance but he hoped to seize the place by a bold assault and encouraging his soldiers both by their ancient enmity to the Roman state and their hopes of immense riches upon the capture he brought on his men and led them boldly to the very walls Appius Claudius who was at that time in Rome and in the interests of Sylla made a sally to oppose him rather with hopes of delaying the assailants than of entirely repressing them The Romans fought with that vigour which the consciousness of defending every thing dear inspires But Appius was killed in the combat and the rest disheartened by the loss of their general seemed preparing for flight Just at this interval a party of Sylla's horse appeared at the opposite gates who throwing themselves into the city and hastening through it met the assailants on the other side The desperate fury of these in some measure suspended the fate of the battle till Sylla with his whole army had time to arrive It was then that a general and dreadful conflict ensued between the Samnite and the Roman army The citizens from their walls beheld thousands fall on both sides At first the forces commanded  by Sylla on the left gave way but his lieutenant Crassus was victorious on the right The battle continued all day till late at night nor was it till the morning that Sylla found himself completely victorious He then visited the field of battle on which more than fifty thousand of the vanquished and the victors lay promiscuously Eight thousand of the Samnites were made prisoners and killed in cold blood after the engagement Marcius and Carinus attempting to escape were taken and their heads being cut off were sent by Sylla's command to be carried round the walls of Praeneste At this sorrowful sight the inhabitants of the place being now destitute of provisions and despairing of all succour from without resolved to surrender but it was only to experience the unrelenting fury of the conqueror who ordered all the males to be slain Marius the cause of these calamities was at first missing and it was thought had got off but he was at last discovered lying dead with a captain of the Samnites at the issue of one of the subterranean passages that led from the city where they had tried to escape but finding it guarded by the enemy killed themselves The city of Norba was now all that remained unsubdued in Italy but the inhabitants after a long resistance dreading the fate of Praeneste set their town on fire and desperately perished  in the flames The destruction of this place put an end to the civil war Sylla now became undisputed master of his country and entered Rome at the head of his army Happy had he supported in peace the glory which he had acquired in war or had he ceased to live when he ceased to conquer  Being now no longer obliged to wear the mask of lenity he began his reign by assembling the people and desired an implicit obedience to his commands if they expected favour He then published that those who expected pardon for their late offences should gain it by destroying the enemies of the state This was a new mode of proscription by which the arms of all were turned against all Great numbers perished by this mutual power which was given the people of destroying each other and nothing was to be found in every place but menaces distrust and treachery Eight thousand who had escaped the general carnage offered themselves to the conqueror at Rome he ordered them to be put into the Villa Publica a large house in the Campus Martius and at the same time convoked the senate there he spoke with great fluency and in a manner no way discomposed of his own exploits and in the mean time ordered all those wretches whom he had confined to be slain The senate amazed at the horrrid outcries of  the sufferers at first thought that the city was given up to plunder but Sylla with an unembarrassed air informed them that it was only some criminals who were punished by his order and that they needed not to make themselves uneasy about their fate The day after he proscribed forty senators and sixteen hundred knights and after an intermission of two days forty senators more with an infinite number of the richest citizens of Rome He declared the children and the grandchildren of the opposite party infamous and divested of the rights of freedom He ordained by a public edict that those who saved or harboured any of the proscribed should suffer in their place He set a price upon the heads of such as were thus to be destroyed two talents being the reward affixed for every murder Slaves invited by such offers were seen to kill their masters and still more shocking to humanity children whose hands still reeked with the blood of their parents came confidently to demand the wages of parricide Nor were the enemies of the state the only sufferers Sylla permitted his soldiers to revenge their private injuries so that husbands were slain by such as desired to enjoy thei  widows and children were slain in the embrace  of their parents who were soon to share the sam  fate Riches now became dangerous to the possessor and even the reputation of fortune was equivalent to guilt Aurelius a peaceable citize  without any other crime found his name among the number of the proscribed and could not help crying out just before his assassination that he owed his death to the magnificence of his palace at Alba But the brother of Marius felt the conqueror's most refined cruelty First he had his eyes plucked out deliberately then his hands and legs cut off at several times to lengthen his torments and in this agonizing situation he was left to expire But these barbarities were not confined only to Rome the proscription was extended to many of the inhabitants of all the cities of Italy and even whole towns and districts were ordered to be laid desolate These were given to his soldiers as rewards for their fidelity who still wanting more excited him to new cruelty In this general slaughter Julius Caesar who had married Cinna's daughter very hardly escaped the miseries of the times Sylla was prevailed upon to let him live though he was heard to say that there were many Mariuses in Caesar  However these arbitrary confiscations and numerous largesses which were given to his followers were not to be retained without some share of continuing power He therefore resolved to invest himself with the dictatorship which by uniting all civil as well as military power in his own person he might thus give an air of justice to every oppression He therefore withdrew  a while from the city and gave order  ▪ that since affairs still remained unsettled the people should be applied to to create a dictator and that not for any limited time but till the public grievances should be redressed To these directions he added his request which as he was possessed of all power was equivalent to a command that he himself should be chosen To this the people being constrained to yield He was chosen perpetual dictator and thus the Romans received a master invested with an authority far more absolute than any of their kings had been possessed of before  The government of Rome having now passed through all the forms of monarchy aristocracy and democracy at length began to settle into despotism from which though it made some faint struggles to be free yet it never compleatly extricated itself till its total dissolution Sylla to amuse the people with a shew of their former government permitted them to have consuls but at the same time took care that none but his own creatures should be elected and that all their power should be entirely derived from him He made several new laws for regulating the different offices of the state He totally destroyed the power of the tribunes by enacting that those who bore it should be incapable of obtaining any other office He added three hundred of the knights to the senate and ten thousand of  the slaves of those who were proscribed to the body of the people To establish these regulations more firmly he appropriated to himself the treasures of the public and lavished them in widening his dependencies and strengthening his interest he seemed to think he could never sufficiently reward his creatures if they were but implicit in their obedience Crassus who was already the richest man in the state was ever soliciting an accumulation of his favours and buying up the effects of such as were proscribed at an under rate Pompey put away his wife Antistia to oblige him and married Emilia the dictator's stepchild He attempted to exercise the same power over Julius Caesar by obliging him to repudiate his wife Cornelia but that young Roman chose to banish himself from the city rather than comply and never returned till Sylla was no more  In this manner he continued to govern with capricious tyranny none daring to resist his power Lucretius Offella shewed how dangerous it was to controul a tyrant in the full exercise of his authority this man ventured to offer himself for the consulship in opposition to one of Sylla's decrees which had forbidden any man's aspiring to that dignity without having gone through the regular gradations of office However as he had formerly rendered some very signal services to his party he thought  that would excuse him He was therefore at first desired to desist from his attempt but persevering Sylla ordered one of his satellites to stab him and then threatened to serve any other person in the same manner who should attempt to invalidate his authority By such means as these he was submitted to with the most blind obedience Whenever he proposed laws the people assembled not to deliberate upon their fitness but to give them the sanction of their consent They found themselves quite ejected from any concern in the state and saw nothing before them but a prospect of hopeless and confirmed slavery It was at this juncture that contrary to the expectations of all mankind Sylla laid down the dictatorship having held it not quite three years  It was not without the greatest surprize that the people saw this conqueror who had made himself so many enemies in every part of the state quitting a power he had earned by such various dangers and reducing himself to the rank of a private citizen But their wonder encreased when they heard him after so many acts of cruelty and such numberless massacres offering to take his trial before the people whom he constituted judges of his conduct Having divested himself in their presence of his office and dismissed the lictors who guarded him he continued to walk for some time in the Forum unattended  and alone At the approach of evening he retired homewards the people following him all the way in a kind of silent astonishment mixed with the profoundest respect Of all that great multitude which he had so often insulted and terrified none was found hardy enough to reproach or accuse him except one young man who pursued him with insulting language to his own door Sylla disdained replying to so mean an adversary but turning to those who attended him observed that this fellow's insolence would for the future prevent any man's laying down an office of such supreme authority It is not easy to divine the motives of Sylla's abdication whether they were from vanity or a deep laid scheme of policy Whether being satiated with the usual adulation which he received for his conquests he was now desirous also of receiving some for his patriotism or whether dreading an assassination from some secret enemy he was willing to disarm him by retiring from the splendors of an envied situation However this may be he soon retired into the country in order to enjoy the pleasures of tranquility and social happiness but he did not long survive his abdication he died of that disease which is called the morbus pedicularis a loathsome object and of mortifying to human ambition He was the first of his family whose body was burnt  for having ordered the remains of Marius to be taken out of his grave and thrown into the river Anio he was apprehensive of the same insult upon his own if left to the usual way of burial A little before his death he made his own epitaph the tenor of which was That no man had ever exceeded him in doing good to his friends or injury to his enemies  As soon as Sylla was dead the old dissensions that had been smothered awhile by the terror of his power burst out again into a flame between the two factions supported severally by the two consuls Catulus and Lepidus who were wholly opposite to each other in party and politics Lepidus resolved at all adventures to rescind the acts of Sylla and recall the exiled Marians beginning openly to solicit the people to support him in that resolution This attempt though plausible was at this time particularly unseasonable when the state was just recovering from the wounds it had lately received in the civil war On the other hand Catulus whose father had been condemned to die by Marius inheriting the principles of his family vigorously opposed and effectually counteracted the designs of his colleague Lepidus thus finding himself unable to attain his ends without recurring to arms retired to his government of Gaul with intent to raise a force sufficient to subdue all opposition where the report of his  levies and military preparations gave such umbrage to the senate that they soon abrogated his command Upon this he advanced into Italy at the head of a large army and marched in an hostile manner towards Rome to demand a second consulship He had with him several of the chief magistrates and the good wishes of all the tribunes so that he hoped by the popularity of his cause to advance himself into Sylla's place and usurp the sovereign authority of the state Catulus in the mean time upon the expiration of his office was invested with the charge of defending the government and Pompey also was by a decree of the senate joined with him in the same commission These therefore having united their forces before Lepidus could reach the city came to an engagement with him near the Milvian Bridge within two miles of Rome where they totally routed and dispersed his whole army But Cisalpine Gaul still remaining in the possession of Brutus his lieutenant and the father of him who afterwards killed Caesar Pompey went to reduce that province where Brutus having sustained a siege in Modena was taken and put to death by Pompey's order As for Lepidus he escaped into Sardinia where he died soon after of grief to see his hopes destroyed and his country fallen under the aristocratical faction  But the hopes of the Marian party did not entirely expire here A more dangerous enemy still remained in Spain who for a while made it doubtful whether that province or Rome should possess the empire of the world This was Sertorius a veteran soldier who had his been bred under Marius and had learned all virtues without sharing one of his vices He was temperate just merciful and brave but his military skill seemed to exceed that of any other general of his time Upon the extinction of the Marian party this brave commander fell into the hands of Sylla who dismissed him with life upon account of his known moderation Yet soon after capriciously repenting of this clemency he proscribed and drove him to the necessity of seeking safety in a distant province Sertorius being thus banished from Rome after several attempts on Africa and the coasts of the Mediterranean found at last a refuge in Spain whither all who fled from Sylla's cruelty resorted to him of whom he formed a senate that gave laws to the whole province There by his great abilities and clemency he so gained the hearts of the warlike inhabitants that for eight years he continued to sustain a war against the whole power of the Roman state Metellus an old experienced commander was sent against him at first but he was so often outgeneralled by his opponent  that the senate were forced to send their favourite Pompey to his assistance with the best troops of the empire Sertorius maintained his ground against them both and after many engagements in which he generally came off equal and often superior he began to meditate nothing less than the invasion of Italy But all his schemes were baffled by the treachery of one of his own lieutenants who was next him in command and envied his rising reputation This wretch's name was Perpenna who had some time before come over to him with the shattered remains of Lepidus's army and was at first an useful assistant However a jealousy arising between them Perpenna invited him to a sumptuous entertainment where having intoxicated all his attendants he fell upon Sertorius and treacherously murdered him But this stroke of barbarity only served to ruin his party which had been entirely supported by the reputation of the general for soon after Perpenna being easily overthrown by Pompey was taken prisoner and all the revolted provinces readily submitted The conqueror is celebrated on this occasion for an action of great prudence and generosity Perpenna in hopes to save his life offered to make some important discoveries and to put into his hands all the papers of Sertorius in which were several letters to and from the principal senators of Rome Pompey however▪  rejecting his offer ordered the traitor to be slain and his papers to be burnt without reading them By these means he eased the people of their fears and prevented those acts of desperation which the consciousness of being discovered might have given rise to  The present prosperity of Pompey was highly pleasing at Rome he had hitherto been successful in all his affairs and in this instance as if fortune had delighted in giving him new opportunities of serving his country he seemed peculiarly fortunate Upon his return he fell in with a large body of slaves that had escaped after their overthrow by Crassus in Italy and cut them to pieces This insurrection which Pompey had the good fortune of thus terminating was called the Servile war and took its rise from a few gladiators who broke from their fencingschool at Capua and having drawn a number of slaves after them overthrew Glaber the praetor who was sent to suppress them and from this success their number presently encreased to an army of forty thousand men With this strength and headed by Spartacus their general they sustained a vigorous war for three years in the very heart of Italy they defeated several commanders of consular and praetorian rank and even began to talk of attacking Rome But Crassius having gathered about him all the forces which were near home drove them before him to the extremity of  Rhegium where for want of vessels to make their escape the greatest part of them were destroyed and among them Spartacus fighting bravely to the last at the head of his desperate forces It was the remainder of this wretched band that Pompey happened to fall in with in his passage across the Alps homeward and as he expressed it to the senate by destroying them plucked up the war by the very roots Thus ended all the civil wars which were excited by the ambition of Marius and Sylla a long and dismal period in which the reader can side with neither party as both were equally cruel base selfinterested and venal The republic had been long fated to destruction its former justice and moderation was gone and it was immaterial who was to have the overwhelming of a corrupted empire  Yet still during this interval which we have been describing all the arts of peace had been cultivated and had risen almost to the summit of perfection Plautus and Terence it is true had flourished some time before but Lucretius the boast of his age who exceeds as much in poetry as he falls short in philosophy adorned those illfated times and charmed with the harmony of his versification Learning however was chiefly cultivated among the great for luxury had not as yet sufficiently descended to the meaner ranks to make them relish the elegant  gratifications of life for mankind must in some measure be satiated with the pleasures of sense before they can think of making new inlets into the pleasures of imagination  CHAP XX From the Perpetual Dictatorship of Sylla to the Triumvirate of Caesar Pompey and Crassus  ALL factions being now apparently quelled in the empire it was hoped that peace would be restored and that the commonwealth would have time to respire from the calamities it had sustained during the civil war But the spirit of ambition had entered into the state and the leading men now saw the possibility of obtaining sovereign power by Sylla's example Of these chiefly now in favour with the senate and the people Pompey and Crassus were foremost both conquerors both desirous of power and both aiming at it by extending their popularity We have already seen Pompey while very young performing one of the most active parts in the conduct of the empire we have seen him joining with and conquering in the cause of Sylla soon after sent into Africa and the first of the equestrian order who had a triumph After that siding against Lepidus and then  conquering the army which had been in Spain commanded by Sertorius To crown all honoured with the consulship in his absence and that before the consular age These successes had greatly inflamed his pride and extended his desire of glory Crassus on the other hand was equally desirous of obtaining popularity but being wholly unequal to his rival in military fame took another road to come at it this was by amassing riches which he gathered from the calamities of his country only to involve it in new distresses He was used to say that no man should be reckoned wealthy who was not able to maintain an army and in fact the number of his slaves was equal to a large one He had besides the character of a good speaker in the senate and by his easy and familiar address and a readiness to assist all who wanted either his protection or his money he acquired great authority in public affairs Besides the rivalship of power between these two great men Crassus had another cause of resentment which was Pompey's assuming to himself the glory of terminating the Servile war for which the other had actually received the honour of a triumph by the senate's command Both therefore secretly wished to undermine each other neither with views of ridding his country of the overgrown power of an aspiring citizen but each with a desire of establishing his own  The first opportunity that was afforded of discovering their mutual jealousy was upon the disbanding their troops with which they had conquered Neither chose to begin so that the most fatal consequences threatened from their dissension but at length Crassus stifling his resentment laid down his command and the other followed his example immediately after The next trial between them was who should be foremost in obtaining the favour of the people Crassus entertained the populace at a thousand different tables distributed corn to the families of the poor and fed the greatest part of the citizens for near three months Pompey on the other hand laboured to abrogate the laws made against the people's authority by Sylla he restored the power of judging to the knights which had been formerly granted them by Gracchus and gave back to the tribunes of the people all their former privileges It was thus that each gave his private aims a public appearance so that what was in reality ambition in both took with one the name of liberality with the other that of freedom  However the arts of Pompey seemed upon this occasion to give him the superiority The tribunes who were restored to all their former dignities thought they could never sufficiently recompence their benefactor they only waited for an opportunity of gratifying his highest ambition  and this soon offered A number of Pyrates formerty employed by Mithridates had by the long continuance of their success in plundering all they met amassed great wealth and got together many thousand men of several nations They made choice of Cilicia for their principal place of resort and not content with robbing by sea ventured even upon conquests by land Italy itself was not free from their invasions where they often landed and carried away whatever they met with in their hasty incursions It was now therefore resolved at Rome to punish their insolence by sending out a fleet that was capable of utterly destroying their power For this Gabinius the tribune preferred a law that Pompey should be created admiral with absolute authority against the Pyrates for three years that his power should extend over the whole Mediterranean sea and its coasts to a certain distance on land that he should raise as many soldiers and mariners as he should think expedient and that he should have from the public treasury whatever sums of money he should think necessary for carrying on the war This law which the senate vainly attempted to oppose gave Pompey a degree of power which he might have easily converted to the detriment of his country but nothing dangerous was to be feared from a man whose actions always testified more of vanity than ambition  Pompey being thus furnished with absolute power over the fleet distributed his lieutenants through the several bays and harbours of the Mediterranean with so much judgment that he soon forced the enemy from their ports In the mean time he himself at the head of the largest squadron of his shipping sailed up and down visiting and instructing such as he sent upon duty By these means in less than forty days he obliged the enemy to take refuge in Cilicia the only retreat that was left them He soon followed them there with sixty of his best ships and though they had prepared to give him battle yet they upon sight of his fleet and struck with the terrors of his name submitted to his mercy As their number amounted to above twenty thousand men he was unwilling to destroy them and yet to permit their returning to their ancient habitations was not safe He therefore removed them to places farther distant from the sea where he gave them lands and thus added new subjects and dominions to the empire of Rome  This expedition having added greatly to Pompey's reputation the tribunes now hoped it would be easier to advance their favourite still higher wherefore Manlius one of the number preferred a law that all the armies of the empire with the government of all Asia together with the management of the war against  Mithridates and Tigranes should be committed to him alone A power so great and unlimited awakened all the jealousy of the senate this they considered as nothing less than proclaiming him sovereign of the whole empire This was giving one already master of the whole fleet an unlimited power by land and even seemed to tempt him to enslave his country The weight of these reasons and still more the authority of the senate were about to preponderate and the tribunes seemed hesitating whether they should not withdraw their motion when Marcus Tullius Cicero rose up to second the law and to pay his tribute of eloquence to the virtues of Pompey It was the first time that this orator had ever addressed the assembly of the people but it was impossible but that eloquence must have been irresistable then which to this day continues to charm and improve posterity The law passed with little opposition the decree was confirmed by all the tribes of the people and Pompey was thus peaceably invested with as great power as Sylla had forced himself into through infinite difficulties  Pompey being thus appointed to the command of the war against Mithridates immediately departed for Asia having made the proper preparations towards forwarding the campaign The war against this monarch was one of the most important that had been hitherto undertaken  by the Romans We do not on this occasion read of princes already overcome by luxury and pride or trembling at the splendor of the Roman name but of a mighty king undaunted in every stage of his fortune and like a lion gaining new courage from every wound His dominions were in fact well situated for supporting a war against an invading enemy They bordered on the inaccessible mountains of Mount Caucasus whose savage inhabitants he could bring into the field they extended thence along the sea of Pontus which he covered with his ships besides he was rich and ever purchasing new armies among the Scythians a people of invincible bravery I have already mentioned the resistance he made against Sylla and the peace which that general forced him to accept this however being the effects of compulsion lasted no longer than while there were forces strong enough to compel him to its observance Murena whom Sylla had left behind attempting to reduce him to obedience only met with disgrace and at last a total overthrow Some  time after Mithridates having procured the alliance of Tigranes king of Armenia invaded the kingdom of Bythinia which he had been formerly obliged to resign and which had been lately bequeathed to the Romans by Nicomedes the king of the country To stop the progress of these conquests Lucullus an experienced  general had been sent from Rome and upon his arrival an engagement ensued in which Mithridates lost his whole army and being obliged to escape by sea was very near falling into the hands of the enemy had he not been taken up by a pyrate who landed him safe in his own dominions No way intimidated by these disasters he soon raised another army and in the beginning gained some advantages over the enemy But Lucullus soon after cut off all his internal resources and forced him to take shelter in the court of Tigranes king of Armenia The Roman general followed him thither also and demanded him up but Tigranes though with no particular attachment to the deposed king refused to deliver him because Lucullus had omitted giving him all his titles Pride it seems was the reigning passion of this weak monarch he was more desirous of receiving homage than of procuring power it was usual with him to oblige the kings he had conquered to attend him as slaves when he appeared in public having assumed from his successes over the weaker states around him the title of monarch of all monarchies This it seems was the title the Roman general disdained granting him the war now therefore changing its object the generals of Tigranes were at first easily overcome and though he soon after engaged at the head of two hundred and fifty thousand men yet he  met with no better success These victories promised a speedy end to the war which had now been protracted for seven years and though the conduct of it was once more devolved upon Mithridates yet he being pressed as much as ever was obliged to take refuge in Lesser Armenia Thither Lucullus was preparing to follow him when accounts came that Glabrio who had been consul for the last year was appointed to displace Lucullus in his command and was actually arrived in Asia for that purpose This disgrace it seems was owing to the intrigues of some of Lucullus's own soldiers who harrassed by perpetual fatigues and debauched by factious officers had privately sent their complaints to the senate wherefore upon Glabrio's arrival the whole army abandonned Lucullus who could not see without indignation their common enemy Mithridates resume all his power and recover the whole kingdom of Pontus while Glabrio testifying no inclination to enter upon a troublesome command continued an idle spectator of his successes and chose to stop short in Bythinia This mutinous spirit the troops of Lucullus and the little inclination Glabrio seemed to have of engaging gave rise to that general desire which prevailed of appointing Pompey to terminate the war who shortly after went over into Asia for that purpose  The first duty which he thought incumbent upon him on his arrival was to propose terms of accommodation to Mithridates but this monarch having a little respired from his great and numerous losses determined to tempt his fortune while it seemed propitious He had found means to collect a very considerable army from the wrecks of his former power and was resolved to follow the Romans into Armenia where he expected to cut off their supplies but being disappointed in this he was obliged to fly having first killed all such as were not able to accompany him in his retreat however he was pursued with great diligence by Pompey and overtaken before he could have time to pass the river Euphrates though it was then night being compelled to engage it is said that the moon shining from behind the Roman army lengthening their shadows so much that the archers of Mithridates shot their arrows at these mistaking the shade for the substance However that be his Asiatic soldiers were unable to withstand the force of the European infantry he did all that lay in the power of a great and experienced general to lead them on to the charge and to prevent their terrors but they could not be brought to endure the shock cowardice and effem nacy having been then as well as now the characteristics of an E  stern army Being thus again overthrown with the loss of almost all his  forces and finding himself hemmed in on every side by the Romans he made a desperate effort at the head of eight hundred horse to break through them and thus effected his escape though with the loss of five hundred of his followers in the attempt He had long been acquainted with distress but his present situation seemed more deplorable than ever he continued for several days sorrowfully wandering through the forests that covered the country leading his horse in his hand and subsisting on whatever fruits he accidentally found on his way in this forlorn situation he met with about three thousand of his soldiers who had escaped from the general carnage and by their assistance he was conducted to one of the magazines where he had deposited those treasures that were intended to support the war He sent from thence to Tigranes for aid but that monarch was too much engaged in suppressing the rebellion of one of his own sons at home to be able to send any succours abroad Disappointed on that side still however he would not despair but fled to Colchis a state which had formerly acknowledged his power Being pursued thither also by Pompey he took another dreadful journey crossed the Araxes marched from danger to danger through the country of the Lazi and assembling all the barbarians he met with in his way induced the Scythian princes to declare against  Rome▪ Stedfast in his enmity he continued his opposition even though he found his own family confederating against him Although betrayed by his son Macharis and tho' his life was attempted by Pharnaces yet he still aimed at great designs and even in the heart of Asia projected the invasion of the Roman empire this he intended to effect by marching into Europe and there being joined by the fierce nations that inhabited Germany and Gaul to cross the Alps into Italy as Hannibal had done before him but his timid Asiatic soldiers were illdisposed to second the great views of their leader Upon being apprized of his intentions a mutiny ensued which was promoted by his son Pharnaces who had been long desirous of gaining the favour of Pompey by parricide Mithridates being thus obliged to take refuge in his palace to escape the fury of the army sent to his son for leave to depart offering him the free possession of all that remained of his wretched fortunes and his title to those dominions of which he had been deprived by the Romans To this the unnatural son made no direct reply conscious that he was offered only what could not be taken away but turning to the slave that brought him themessage he bade him with a stern countenance tell his father that death was all that now remained for him Such an horrid instance of filial impiety added new  poignance to the wretched monarch's affliction he could not refrain from venting his imprecations and from wishing that such an unnatural child might one day meet with similar ingratitude from his own children Upon this coming down from his own appartment where he had been for some time alone he entered that particularly assigned to his wives children and domestics where he bid all those prepare for death who did not chuse to undergo the horrors of a Roman captivity They all readily consented to die with their monarch and chearfully taking the poison which he had in readiness expired before him As for himself having used his body much to antidotes the poison had but little effect whereupon he attempted to dispatch himself with his sword but that also failing a Gaulish soldier whose name was Bitaeus performed this friendly office Thus died Mithridates betrayed by his son and forsaken by an army that seemed terrified at the greatness of his enterprizes His fortune was various his courage always the same he had for twentyfive years opposed Rome and though he was often betrayed by his captains his children and his wives yet he continually found resources against his enemies and was formidable to the very last  In the mean time Pompey was diligently employed in pursuing his advantages over Tigranes  who had not only to resist the Romans but his own three sons that had united in rebellion against him Two of these he had the fortune to overthrow and put to death but he was soon after compelled by Pompey to surrender His remaining son who had taken refuge in the Roman camp did all that lay in his power to prevent a reconciliation but Pompey reprimanding his disobedience treated the old king with great humanity and restored him the greatest part of his former dominions only depriving him of his conquests and fining him six thousand talents towards defraying the expences of the war His son continuing still averse to the treaty and threatening his father's life was confined by the general's command in order to be reserved for his triumph into Rome Nothing now therefore being able to check the progress of Pompey's arms he marched onward over the vast mountains of Taurus setting up and deposing kings at pleasure Darius the king of Media and Antiochus king of Syria were compelled to submit to his clemency Phraates king of Parthia was obliged to retire and send to entreat a peace From thence extending his conquests over the Thuraeans and Arabians he reduced all Syria and Pontus into Roman provinces Then turning towards Judea he summoned Aristobulus who had usurped the priesthood from his elder brother Hyrcanus to appear before  him but Aristobulus had fortified the temple of Jerusalem against him and refused to answer This venerable place which was thus converted into a garrison being very strong from its situation held out for three months but was at last taken and twelve thousand of its defenders slain Pompey entered this great sanctuary with a mixture of resolution and fear he shewed an eager curiosity to enter into the Holy of Holies there he gazed for some time upon those things which it was unlawful for any but the priests themselves to behold Notwithstanding he shewed so much veneration for the place that he forbore touching any of the vast treasures deposited there After restoring Hyrcanus to the priesthood and government he took Aristobulus with him to grace his triumph upon his return This triumph which lasted two days was the most splendid that had ever entered the gates of Rome therein were exposed the names of fifteen conquered kingdoms eight hundred cities taken twentynine repeopled and a thousand castles brought to acknowledge the empire of Rome Among the prisoners led in triumph appeared the son of Tigranes Aristobulus king of Judea the sister of Mithridates together with the hostages of the Albanians Iberians and the king of Comagena The treasures that were brought home amounted to near four  millions of our money and the trophies and other splendors of the procession were such that the spectators seemed lost in the magnificent profusion All these victories however rather served to heighten the glory than to encrease the power of Rome they only made it a more glaring object of ambition and exposed its liberties to greater danger Those liberties indeed seemed devoted to ruin on every side for even while Pompey was pursuing his conquests abroad Rome was at the verge of ruin from a conspiracy at home  This conspiracy was projected and carried on by Sergius Catiline a patrician by birth who resolved to build his own power on the downfal of his country He was singularly formed both by art and nature to conduct a conspiracy he was possessed of courage equal to the most desperate attempts and eloquence to give a colour to his ambition ruined in his fortunes profligate in his manners and vigilant in pursuing his aims he was insatiable after wealth only with a view to lavish it in his guilty pleasures in short as Cicero describes him he was a compound of opposite passions intemperate to excess yet patient of labour to a wonder severe with the virtuous debauched with the gay so that he had all the vicious for his friends by inclination and he attached even some of the good by the specious shew of pretended virtue  However his real character was at length very well known at Rome he had been accused of debauching a vestal virgin he was suspected of murdering his son to gratify a criminal passion and it was notorious that in the proscription of Sylla he had killed his own brother to make his court to the tyrant  Catiline having contracted many debts by the looseness of such an illspent life was resolved to extricate himself from them by any means however unlawful his first aim therefore was at the consulship in which he hoped to repair his shattered fortune by the plunder of the provinces but in this he was frustrated This disgrace so operated upon a mind naturally warm that he instantly entered into an association with Piso and some others of desperate fortunes like himself in which it was resolved to kill the consuls that had been just chosen with several other senators and to share the government among themselves These designs however were discovered before they were ripe for action and the senate took care to obviate their effects Some time after he again sued for the consulship and was again disappointed the great Cicero whose character will be given hereafter being preferred before him Enraged at these repeated mortifications he now breathed nothing but revenge his design was had he then obtained the consulship and with it the command  of the armies of the empire to have seized upon the liberties of his country and governed alone At length impatience under his disappointments would not permit him to wait for the ripening of his schemes wherefore he formed the mad resolution of usurping the empire though yet without means adequate to the execution  Many of those who were in the former conspiracy of Piso still remained attached to his interests these he assembled to about the number of thirty where he informed them of his aims and his hopes settled a plan of operations and fixed a day for the execution It was resolved among them that a general insurrection should be raised throughout Italy the different parts of which were assigned to the different leaders Rome was to be fired in several places at once and Catiline at the head of an army raised in Etruria was in the general confusion to possess himself of the city and massacre all the senators Lentulus one of his profligate assistants who had been praetor or judge in the city was to preside in their general councils Cethegus a man who sacrificed the possession of great present power to the hopes of gratifying his revenge against Cicero was to direct the massacre through the city and Cassius was to conduct those who fired it But the vigilance of Cicero being a chief obstacle  to their designs Catiline was very desirous to see him taken off before he left Rome upon which two knights of the company undertook to kill him the next morning in his bed in an early visit on pretence of business The meeting however was no sooner over than Cicero had information of all that passed in it for by the intrigues of a woman named Fulvia he had gained over Curius her lover and one of the conspirators to send him a punctual account of all their deliberations Having taken proper precautions to guard himself against the designs of his morning visitors who were punctual to the appointment he next took care to provide for the defence of the city and assembling the senate consulted what was best to be done in this time of danger The first step taken was to offer considerable rewards for farther discoveries and then to prepare for the defence of the state Catiline to shew how well he could dissemble or justify any crime went boldly to the senate declaring his innocence and offering to give any security for his behaviour These professions urged with an apparent humility gained over many of the Roman senators but Cicero incensed at his effrontery instead of pursuing the business of the day rose up and addressing himself to Catiline broke out into a most severe invective against him The speech is still remaining in which with all the fire of  incensed eloquence he lays open the whole course of his crimes and the particulars of his present impeachment When Cicero was seated Catiline rose in his turn and with well prepared dissimulation and a dejected countenance besought the senate not over rashly to credit vain reports concerning him nor believe that a person of his rank whose ancestors and whose services demanded rather fame than censure could be guilty of such vile imputations While he was continuing his defence and beginning to introduce some reflections against the consul the chief of which was the obscurity of his original the senate refused to hear him whereupon he declared aloud that since he was denied a vindication of himself and driven headlong by his enemies he would extinguish the flame which was raised about him in universal ruin thus saying he rushed out of the assembly threatening destruction to all his opposers As soon as he was returned to his house and began to reflect on what had passed he perceived it vain to dissemble any longer wherefore resolving to enter at once into action before the commonwealth was prepared to oppose him after a short conference with Lentulus and Cethegus he left Rome by night with a small retinue to make the best of his way towards Etruria were Manlius one of the conspirators was raising an army to support him  In the mean time Cicero took proper precautions to secure all those of the conspiracy who remained in Rome and induced the people by the power of his eloquence to second his designs Lentulus Cethegus Caesius and several others were put in confinement and it was propounded to the senate what course should be taken with the prisoners The principal evidences against them were the ambassadors of the Allobroges a fierce people inhabiting the countries now called Dauphiny and Savoy who deposed that they had been applied to to furnish a body of horse whenever the war should begin but that being apprehensive of the danger they had declined the proposal at the same time producing the letters of Lentulus to them for that purpose marked with his own seal Upon this a great debate arose in the house concerning the punishment of the prisoners a deliberation of great delicacy and importance Capital punishments were rare and even odious in Rome while on the other hand the crimes of which they were convicted required a quick and exemplary punishment Silanus the ensuing year's consul was of opinion that they should all be put to death to this all who spoke after him readily assented till it came to Julius Caesar's turn to deliver his opinion This extraordinary man who was chosen praetor for the ensuing year had from the  very beginning of his life marked out a way to universal empire and now thought that a shew of clemency upon this occasion would conciliate the favour of the people It is supposed also by some that he secretly favoured the conspiracy and only waited for its first fortunes to put himself at its head He therefore observed in an elegant and elaborate speech for of all orators in the commonwealth Cicero alone excelled him that those who opined for death were on the merciful side since death was but the relief of the miserable and left no sense of good or ill beyond it The heinousness of the present crime he said might justify any severity but the example was dangerous in a free state where power sometimes happened to fall into bad hands Though no danger could be apprehended from such a consul as Cicero yet in other times and under other consuls none could tell how far justice might stop short of cruelty his opinion therefore was that the conspirators should be sentenced to perpetual confinement His speech delivered with all the arts of a complete orator seemed to make great impression on the whole assembly Silanus himself began to excuse and mitigate the severity of his former sentence and even the friends of the consul were almost convinced when Porcius Cato at last stood up to oppose it No two characters could be more opposite than his to that of the former speaker  Caesar was merciful gentle and insinuating Cato severe forceful and overbearing Caesar loved his country in hopes one day to govern it Cato loved it more than other countries only because he thought it more free the one scrupled no means however illicit to attain his ends the other laboured but to one end by one way the most exalted justice conducting him to the most inflexible virtue In fact the opinions of the Greek philosophers began to give a bent to the dispositions of the great men of the time so that Caesar was a follower of Epicurus and Cato was a rigid stoic He began therefore by describing Cicero as he really was a man dignified with almost every virtue conducive to his own happiness together with all the talents that could improve happiness in others He proceeded by wondering how any debate could arise about punishing men who had begun an actual war upon their country that he had never pardoned in himself the very wanderings of his heart and could not easily forgive the most flagitious actions in others that they were not deliberating on the fate of the prisoners only but on that of Catiline's whole army which would be animated or dejected in proportion to the vigour of their decrees wherefore his opinion was since the criminals had been convicted both by testimony and their own confession that they should suffer  death according to the custom of their ancestors in circumstances of the like nature His speech was seconded by another still more forceful from Cicero and these carried such conviction that they put an end to the debate The vote for the death of the conspirators was no sooner passed than Cicero resolved to put it in execution lest the night which was coming on should produce any new disturbance Lentulus Cethegus and the rest were therefore taken from their respective sureties and conducted by the chief magistrates who delivered them over to the executioners who presently strangled them in prison  In the mean time Catiline had raised an army of twelve thousand men of which a fourth part only was compleatly armed the rest begin furnished with what chance afforded darts lances and clubs He refused at first to enlist slaves who flocked to him in great numbers trusting to the proper strength of the conspiracy but upon the approach of the consul who was sent against him and the arrival of the news that his confederates were put to death in Rome the face of his affairs was entirely altered His first attempt therefore was by long marches to make his escape over the Appennines into Gaul but in this his hopes were disappointed all the passes being strictly guarded by an army under Metellus superior  to his own Being thus hemmed in on every side and seeing all things desperate with nothing left him but either to die or conquer  e resolved to make one vigorous effort against that army which pursued him Antonius the consul being himself sick the command devolved upon his lieutenant Petreius who after a fierce and bloody action in which he lost a considerable part of his best troops destroyed Catiline and his whole army which fought desperately to the last man they all fell in the very ranks in which they stood when alive and as if inspired with the spirit of their leader fought not so much to conquer as to sell a bloody victory and to mingle public calamity with their private ruin The commonwealth being thus freed from their apprehensions of danger unanimously concurred in their applauses of Cicero whose councils had been the chief means of removing them Public thanks were decreed him by the senate and at the instance of Cato he was styled the Father of his country the people with loud acclamations confirming the justice of the decree  The extinction of this conspiracy seemed only to leave an open theatre for the ambition of the great men of the state to display itself in Pompey was now returned in triumph from conquering the East as he had before been victorious in Europe and Africa Every eye was fixed  upon him as being the most powerful man in the state and capable of governing it at his pleasure His success in war had procured him the surname of Great and he was still more pleased with the title than the consciousness of deserving it This was the post his ambition aimed at he seemed more desirous of being the leader than the ruler of his country of being applauded than obeyed He had it in his power often to make himself master of the state by force but he either declined the fatigue of it or lived in perpetual expectation of receiving as a gift what he did not chuse to extort by violence His parts were specious rather than penetrating and his chief instrument in governing was dissimulation but being a better soldier than statesman he was adored abroad and gained in the camp that homage which was denied him at home  The first thing he did upon his return was to direct the election of both the consuls by whose help he hoped he should readily obtain the ratification of all that he had disposed of in Asia together with a distribution of lands to his soldiers of part of the countries they had conquered However he was disappointed in both these expectations the senate who began to see and dread his power were desirous of besieging it by every opposition The two consuls turned against him as well as the rest and were  seconded by all those who were not the profest instruments of his party The tribune Fl  vius who was the promoter of the law impatient of the delay and animated by Pompey's power had the hardiness to commit Metellus the consul to prison and when all the senate followed and resolved to go to prison with him the tribune put his chair against the door to keep them out This violence however gave such offence to the people that Pompey found it adviseable to draw off the tribune and relea  e the consul From this opposition in the senate he began to find that his own interest alone would not be sufficient to rule the commonwealth without taking in some of the most powerful men of the state not as partners to divide his power but as instruments to assist i    Crassus as we have already observed was the richest man in Rome and next him possessed of the greatest authority his party in the senate was even stronger than that of Pompey his rival and the envy raised against him was less He and Pompey had been long disunited by an opposition of interests and of characters however it was from a continuance of their mutual jealousies that the state was in some measure to expect its future safety It was in this situation of things that Julius Caesar who had lately gone praetor into Spain and had returned with great riches and glory resolved to  convert their mutual jealousy to his own advantage This celebrated man was nephew to Marius by the female line and descended from one of the most illustrious families in Rome he had already mounted by the regular gradations of office having been quaestor aedile and grand pontiff and praetor in Spain Being descended from popular ancestors he warmly espoused the side of the people and shortly after the death of Sylla procured those whom he had banished to be recalled He had all along declared for the populace against the senate and by this became their most favourite magistrate He had received proper intelligence during his administration in Spain of what was going forward and resolved to return to improve occurrences in his favour His services in Spain had deserved a triumph and his ambition aspired at the consulship However it was contrary to law for him to have both for to obtain the consulship he must come into the city and by entering the city he was disqualified for a triumph In this dilemma he preferred solid power to empty parade and determined to stand for the consulship at the same time resolving to attach the two most powerful men in the state to him by effecting their reconciliation He accordingly began first by offering his services to Pompey promising him his aid in having all his acts passed notwithstanding  the senate's opposition Pompey pleased at the acquisition of a person of so much merit readily granted him his confidence and protection He next applied to Crassus who from former connexions was disposed to become still more nearly his friend at length finding neither averse to an union of interests he took an opportunity of bringing them together and remonstrating to them the advantage as well as the necessity of a reconciliation had art enough to persuade them to forget former animosities A combination was thus formed by which they agreed that nothing should be done in the commonwealth but what received their mutual concurrence and approbation This was called the first Triumvirate by which we find the constitution weakened by a new interest that had not hitherto taken place in the government very different from that either of the senate or the people and yet dependant on both A power like this however as it depended upon the nice conduct of different interests could not be of long continuance and in fact it was soon after swallowed up in the military power which took away even the shadow of liberty  CHAP XXI From the beginning of the first Triumvirate to the death of Pompey  THE commonwealth might at this time be considered as made up of three different bodies each pursuing separate interests The Triumvirate aiming at sovereign authority and desirous by depressing the senate and alluring the people to extend their own influence The senate equally apprehensive of the three great men who controled them and of the people who opposed them formed a middle interest between both and desirous of reestablishing the aristocracy which had been set up by Sylla gave their struggles the name of freedom The people on the other hand were desirous of freedom in the most extensive sense and with a fatal blindness only apprehensive of the invasion of it from the side of the senate gave all their influence to the triumvirate whose promises were great and pretences specious  The first thing Caesar did upon being taken into the triumvirate was to avail himself of the interest of his confederates to obtain the consulship The senate had still some small influence  left and though they were obliged to chuse him yet they gave him for a colleague one Bibulus who they supposod would be a check upon his power but the opposition was too strong for even superior abilities to resist it so that Bibulus after a slight attempt in favour of the senate remained inactive the succeeding part of the year Caesar however was by no means so but began his schemes for empire by ingratiating himself with the people He preferred a law for dividing certain lands in Campania among such of the poor citizens as had at least three children This proposal was just enough in itself and only criminal from the views of the proposer The senate being resolved to oppose him in all his schemes endeavoured to thwart him in this which only served to exasperate the people still more against them▪ The multitude drove them from the place of assembling with stones Cato and Bibulus who were most active against the law were compelled to retire and the rest of the senate were obliged to take an oath to confirm the observance of it During this struggle Pompey and Crassus became the dupes of their associate driving the law forward with all their activity and interest the former publickly declared that if any would come as he was informed they would with swords to oppose it he would be the first to lift up his shield in its defence  By this conduct he lost all his former influence in the senate while Caesar only gained all the popularity of a law which was of his own proposing From that time he acted entirely without the assistance of his colleague so that it was jestingly called the consulship of Julius and Caesar intimating that all things were done only by him  Having thus ingratiated himself with the people his next step was to procure the favour of the knights who made a very powerful body in the state They had for many years been the the financers or farmers of the public revenue and by that means had acquired vast riches however they now began to complain of their inability to pay the stipulated sums into the treasury Caesar therefore procured a law to abate a third part of their disbursements notwithstanding the opposition of the senate In this manner having advanced his influence among the lower orders of the state he determined to attach Pompey still more closely to him by giving him his daughter Julia in marriage a woman with every accomplishment that could tend to cement their confederacy  Having thus strengthened himself at home he next deliberated with his confederates about sharing the foreign provinces of the empire between them The partition was soon made Pompey chose Spain for his own part for being  fatigued with conquest and satiated with military fame he was willing to take his pleasures at Rome and there being no appearance of revolt in that province he knew it could easily be governed by his lieutenant Crassus chose Syria for his part of the empire which province as it had hitherto enriched the generals who had subdued it would he hoped gratify him in this his most favourite pursuit To Caesar was left the provinces of Gaul composed of many fierce and powerful nations most of them unsubdued and the rest only professing a nominal subjection Wherefore as it was rather appointing him to conquer than command this government was granted him for five years as if by its continuance to compensate for its danger Having thus divided the empire between them they each of them prepared for their respective destinations but previous to Caesar's setting out there was still an obstacle that seemed to blast his aims and which he wished to have removed This was Tullius Cicero whom we have already seen by his penetration and eloquence defeating the conspiracy of Catiline and who still continued a watchful guardian over the liberties of Rome This great orator and statesman or to give him an higher appellation still this excellent philosopher had from a very humble original raised himself into the foremost rank of the state he was endowed with  all the wisdom and all the virtues that could adorn a man However his wisdom by directing his views over too wide a sphere often overlooked those advantages which are clearly discerned by shortsighted cunning and his virtues by being applauded by others and receiving his own conscious approbation enclined him to vanity He seemed in his general conduct guilty of a fault too common with men of great abilities a desire of uniting in himself incompatible qualities which gave an air of ridicule to his greatest actions Thus while he aimed at being the first orator in the state he was eager also to be thought the best jester while he taught men to contemn vanity he was seen earnestly intriguing for the honour of a triumph which however he had done nothing to merit While no man saw the corruptions of the times more clearly than he yet he had hopes of governing so corrupt a commonwealth without fraud Thus though he saw through every person he conversed with yet he suffered himself to be the dupe of many rather than recede from the rectitude of his aims It was no wonder therefore that Caesar was desirous of expelling such a character from the republic which was so unlike his own to effect this he resolved to take into his party Publius Clodius a man of patrician birth dissolute manners great popularity and an inveterate enemy of Cicero  Besides an opposition of character a principal cause of their enmity was Cicero's having formerly appeared against him upon his trial before the people for an offence against the matrons of Rome whose mysteries he had intruded upon dressed in woman's cloaths He was at this time a tribune of the people although he had been obliged to get himself adopted by a plebeian before he could obtain that office The hopes of revenging himself upon Cicero in some measure incited him to stand for it and the concurrence of Caesar and Pompey with his pretensions soon assured him of success He therefore publickly began to accuse Cicero for having put the late conspirators to death who being citizens ought to have been adjudged by the people Cicero terrified at this accusation did all that lay in his power to oppose it He applied to Caesar to take him as his lieutenant into Gaul but Clodius had art enough to allure him from that design by pretending that his resentment was rather a matter of form than of revenge Pompey too contributed to put him off his guard by a promise of protection so that the cunning of these men of moderate abilities was more than a match for the wisdom of the philosopher Clodius having first caused a law to be enacted importing that any who had condemned a Roman citizen unheard should himself be banished soon after impeached  Cicero upon it It was in vain that this great man went up and down the city soliciting his cause in the habit of a suppliant and attended by many of the first young noblemen whom he had taught the rules of eloquence those powers of speaking which had been so often successful in defending the cause of others totally seemed to forsake him in his own he was banished by the votes of the people four hundred miles from Italy his houses were ordered to be demolished and his goods set up to sale None now remained that could defend the part of the senate but Cato and he was shortly after sent into Cyprus under pretence of doing him a favour but in reality in order to leave an open theatre for the triumvirate to act in Caesar during these intrigues pretended to be an unconcerned spectator and to be wholly occupied in his preparations for going into Gaul He in fact left nothing undone that might advance the speed or encrease the strength of this expedition wherefore leaving Pompey to guard their mutual interests at home he marched into his province at the head of four legions that were granted him by the senate and two more that were lent him by his new associate in the empire  It would be impossible in the narrow compass which I have assigned myself to enumerate all the battles Caesar fought and the states he subdued  in his expeditions into Gaul and Britain which continued eight years He has himself given a detail of them in his Commentaries a work which does as much honour to his abilities as a writer as his conduct did to his talents as a general To abridge such a work is but to destroy it to turn it into a dry catalogue of names that cease to interest and of battles that would appear to be all the same it will be sufficient just to mention those victories which a great and experienced general at the head of a disciplined army gained over the barbarous and tumultuary though numerous forces that were led to oppose him The Helvetians were the first that were brought into subjection with the loss of near two hundred thousand men those who remained after the carnage were sent by Caesar in safety to their forests from whence they had issued The Germans with Ariovistus at their head were next cut off to the number of eighty thousand their monarch himself narrowly escaping in a little boat across the Rhine The Belgae were cut off with such great slaughter that marshes and deep rivers were rendered passable from the heaps of slain The Nervians who were the most warlike of those barbarous nations made head for a short time and fell upon the Romans with such fury that their army was in danger of being utterly routed but Caesar himself hastily catching  up a buckler rushed through his army into the midst of the enemy by which means he so turned the fate of the day that the barbarians were all cut off to a man The Celtic Gauls who were powerful at sea were next brought under subjection After them the Suevi the Menapii and all the nations from the Mediterranean to the British sea From thence stimulated by the desire of conquest he crossed over into Britain upon pretence that the natives had furnished his enemies with continual supplies Upon approaching the shores he found them covered with men to oppose his landing and his forces were in danger of being driven back till the standardbearer of the tenth legion boldly leaped ashore and being well assisted by Caesar the natives were put to flight The Britons being terrified at Caesar's power sent to desire a peace which was granted them and some hostages delivered A storm however soon after destroying great part of his fleet they resolved to take advantage of the disaster and marched against him with a powerful army But what could a naked undisciplined army do against forces that had been exercised under the greatest generals and hardened by the conquest of the greatest part of the world Being overthrown they were obliged once more to sue for peace which Caesar granted them and then returned to the continent  But his absence once more inspired this people naturally fond of liberty with a resolution to disclaim the Roman power wherefore he resolved upon a second expedition where by repeated victories he so intimidated their general Cassibelanus that he no longer attempted to resist him in the plains but keeping in the forests attempted to protract the war However Caesar pursuing him closely and crossing the Thames with his army so straitened him that he was obliged to submit to the conqueror's conditions who imposed an annual tribute and took hostages for the payment of it Thus in less than nine years he conquered together with Britain all that country which extends from the Mediterranean to the German sea It is said that in these expeditions he took eight hundred cities subdued three hundred different states overcame three millions of men one of which fell on the field of battle and one was made prisoners of war These conquests and this destruction of mankind may in the present advancement of morals be regarded with detestation but they were regarded as the heighth of human virtue at the time they were atchieved In fact if we examine Caesar's great assiduity in providing for his army his great skill in disposing them for battle and his amazing intrepidity during the engagement we shall not find a greater general in all antiquity  But in one thing he excelled all with incontestible superiority namely in his humanity to the vanquished This seemed a virtue but little known to the times he lived in so that mankind were then more obliged to heroes than they at present chuse to confess almost each of whom has introduced and given sanction to some new virtues which philosophers▪ might have speculatively applauded before but could never have influence to make popular without such an example  While Caesar was thus encreasing his reputation and riches abroad Pompey who remained all the time in Rome steadily cooperated with his ambition and advanced his interests while he vainly supposed he was forwarding his own Upon the first news of his great exploits he procured a decree of the senate for a solemn festival of fifteen days which was doing Caesar greater honour than any general had received before him When Caesar after remaining in Gaul three years passed over into Italy to refresh himself for a while from his fatigues in order to renew the next campaign with greater vigour Pompey together with Crassus took a journey from Rome to meet him and there when Caesar pleaded the cessity of being continued in his command his associates resolved to endeavour at the consulship for the next year in order to keep him  his province for five years longer This design was so displeasing to the senate and the dissentions so violent concerning it that they went into mourning as in a case of public calamity Cato did all that lay in his power to oppose their aims declaring upon every occasion that the liberty of Rome was in danger he even procured one Domitius to offer himself a candidate against the interest of the whole triumvirate Pompey however knew how little the indignation of the senate could avail against the power he was already possessed of wherefore he sent a body of armed men against Domitius as he was going to offer himself at the election These killed the slave that preceded him and then dispersed the company Cato being wounded and Domitius hardly escaping with life By this violence Pompey becoming master of the suffrages he and Crassus were declared consuls and in consequence of this promotion Caesar was continued five years longer in Gaul Crassus was appointed to Syria where as we have said he expected to reap an harvest rather of wealth than of glory and Pompey was fixed in his government of Spain which he governed wholly by his lieutenants pretending that he could not leave Rome because of the general charge of provisions which was committed to his care an office procured him by Cicero who was lately recalled from  banishment by his influence the popularity of Clodius having given him some umbrage  In this manner Pompey continued to dictate to the senate and to exercise his authority rather than encrease it But he began at last to be rouzed from his lethargy by the rising reputation of Caesar The fame of that great commander's valour riches and humanity began secretly to give him pain and to make him suppose they began to eclipse his own for as being more recent they were more talked of He feared nothing so much as an equal in point of glory and yet by his own arts he had raised Caesar's so high that he was threatened with a superior He now therefore began by a change of the same arts to do all that was in his power to diminish Caesar's reputation obliging the magistrates not to publish any letters they received from him till he had diminished the credit of them by spreading disadvantageous reports While every thing thus portended a repture between these principal men accident contributed not a little to widen the separation by the death of Julia Pompey's wife who had not a little contributed to improve the harmony that subsisted between them From this moment Pompey resolved to pursue his own particular advancement and to depress that of one whom he found though too late  to share an equal degree of reputation with himself  However his efforts were now too late Caesar was in possession of a great share of popularity which it had been the study of his life to promote he was loved almost to adoration by his army whose attachment he had gained by his humanity and great rewards he seemed to acquire immense riches only to bestow them upon the bravest and most deserving of his soldiers particularly those who were worn out in his service he paid the debts of many of his officers and gave them every motive to wean their love from the public and to place it on their commander Nor were his attentions fixed upon his soldiers alone but extended to his partizans in the city he assisted these by promoting them to offices lavishing large sums of money to bribe their elections he pillaged the wealth of his provinces to spread it among the citizens of Rome and gave even his rapine an air of generosity  All this was frequently told Pompey but he at first wished it true then pretended to disbelieve it and at last found that he had committed a fatal oversight but suffered that consideration to prevail as late as possible However he at length wished to resume that power which he had formerly suffered others to share and an opportunity soon offered of obtaining  his desire As all elections had for many years  been carried on by sedition and bribery there seemed about that time to be a total cessation of authority no magistrates having been elected for the space of eight months This state of anarchy was heightened still more by the death of Clodius who was killed by Milo in the country as he was upon his return to town As Clodius had been always a favourite of the people his body was immediately brought to Rome and exposed publickly to view Nothing more was requisite to kindle a tumult the multitude ran furiously to Milo's house to set it on fire but being defended by his partizans Milo repulsed them with great slaughter Upon this returning to the dead body they drew it to the senatehouse and there making a pile of the seats of the magistrates consumed both the body and that stately building together After this the mutineers dispersed themselves all over the city where under pretence of searching for Milo's friends they committed the greatest outrages that unlicensed fury could suggest Thus every street was filled with murders and quarrels while none could walk from their own houses in safety In this universal tumult and distraction all eyes were turned upon Pompey to restore tranquility and give the sufferers redress Many were for creating him dictator but Cato unwilling to endanger the state by  entrusting the greatest power to the most notorious ambition prevailed that instead of being created dictator he should be made Sole consul which differed from the former office but in this that he was accountable for maleadministration upon the resignation of his employment In consequence of this accession of power a body of troops were allotted to him a thousand talents were granted to subsist them the government of Spain was continued to him for four years longer and Milo was accused of having killed Clodius and condemned to banishment even though Cicero himself undertook to defend him It seems the tribunal from whence he harrangued the populace was surrounded by the consul's soldiers so that he was quite intimidated and unable to proceed with his usual impetuosity Pompey who had hitherto acted alone then took in Metellus for his colleague whose daughter Cornelia he had lately married a woman of great merit and beauty and by this new alliance he supposed he had confirmed his former authority  Caesar who now began to be sensible of the jealousies of Pompey took occasion from the many honours which the latter had just received to sollicit for the consulship in his turn with a prolongation of his government in Gaul desirous of trying whether Pompey would thwart or promote his pretensions In this Pompey  seemed to be quite inactive but at the same time privately employed two of his creatures who alledged in the senate that the laws did not permit a person that was absent to offer himself as a candidate for that high office Pompey's view in this was to allure Caesar from his government in order to stand for the consulship in person Caesar however perceiving his artifice chose to remain in his province convinced that while he headed such an army as was now devoted to his interests he could at any time give laws as well as magistrates to the state  The senate which were now devoted to Pompey because he had for some time attempted to defend them from the encroachments of the people ordered the two legions which were in Caesar's army belonging to Pompey home as it was pretended to oppose the Parthians but in reality to diminish Caesar's power Caesar easily saw their motive but as his plans were not yet ready for execution he sent them home in pursuance of the orders of the senate having previously attached the officers to him with benefits and the soldiers with a bounty The next step the senate took was to recall Caesar from his government as his time was now very near expiring Every person perceived the danger the state was in from the continuance of his command over an army entirely devoted to  his interests and become almost invincible by long experience It was the general sense therefore of the house that Caesar should return and some went so far as to talk of bringing him to an account for the large sums of money he had extorted from the provinces of Gaul But Caesar was not without his friends in the senate among the rest Curio who had lately been elected a tribune of the people and had been bribed to his interests secretly favoured his cause Curio was a man of strong eloquence great resolution loaded with debts and deeply engaged to Caesar for extricating him from a part of them he therefore pretended highly to approve the resolutions of the house and asserted that he could never think liberty secure while such armies were in readiness to destroy it whenever their leaders should give the word of command but then he thought the chief security of the state depended upon the fear which these armies whether in Spain Gaul or Italy stood in of each other It was therefore his opinion that Caesar should not leave his army till Pompey had set him the example This was a proposal which Pompey had by no means been prepared for his friends alledged that his time was not yet expired but this not satisfying the tribune Pompey himself observed that he had taken up his offices at the command of the senate and that he was  ready to resign them whenever his employers thought fit that he knew Caesar with whose friendship and alliance he had been made happy would not hesitate to do the same when he knew the senate had appointed him a successor Curio who saw the art of Pompey whose only aim was to have a successor actually nominated replied that in order to shew the sincerity of his professions it was not enough to promise to give up his government but at that very instant to perform a thing he had it so easily in his power to do he added that both were too powerful and that it was for the interest of the commonwealth that they should return to their former privacy he concluded with saying that there was no other method left for public security but to order both to lay down their commands and to declare him an enemy to his country who should disobey Curio had made this proposal with a certainty of its being rejected by Pompey whom he knew to be too well acquainted with the advantages of command and too confident of his own superiority over Caesar to begin the submission in fact he judged very justly Pompey was rendered arrogant not only by his long good fortune and his present honour but also by accounts brought him continually from Caesar's army importing that his soldiers had no esteem for him and that they would certainly forsake  him as soon as they had croft the Alps all which falsehoods though merely invented to gain Pompey's favour by suiting the account to his inclinations he readily gave credit to Nay to such a pitch of self security did he at last make pretensions that when Cicero asked him what forces he had to repell Caesar Pompey replied that if he only stamped with his foot an army would start up from the ground to oppose him Thus confidence at first and shame soon after to have been in the wrong operated so powerfully upon him that he did not prepare for his defence lest he should be obliged to acknowledge himself in danger  Curio having attained his aims in this particular dismist the senate as he was impowered to do by his office but Marcellus who was consul and a creature of Pompey convoked it immediately after and then put it to the vote whether Caesar should be continued in his government The whole assembly were immediately of opinion that he should be discontinued He then demanded their pleasure as to Pompey's continuance in the government he enjoyed The majority declared that it was proper to continue him Curio then put a third question whether it would not be most expedient to discontinue them both to which three hundred and sixty of the senate assented and twenty two only declared against it Marcellus being thus frustated in  his views of obtaining the sanction of the senate to continue Pompey in his government could not contain his resentment but rising in a rage cried out If you will have Caesar for your master why have him Upon which one of his own party asserting in order to intimidate the senate still more that Caesar was past the Alps and marching with his whole army directly towards Rome the consul immediately quitting the senate went with his colleague forth from the city to an house where Pompey at that time resided He there presented him with a sword commanding him to march against Caesar and fight in defence of the commonwealth Pompey declared he was ready to obey but with an air of pretended moderation added that it was only in case more gentle expedients could not be employed  Caesar who was instructed in all that past by his partizans at Rome though he was still in Gaul was willing to give his aims all the appearance of justice He therefore wrote to the senate several times desiring to be continued in his government of Gaul as Pompey had been in that of Spain or else that he should be permitted to stand for the consulship and his absence dispensed with He agreed to lay down his employment when Pompey should do the same But the senate who were devoted to his rival rejected all his propositions blindly confident  of their own power and relying on the assurances of Pompey Caesar still unwilling to come to an open rupture with the state at last was content to ask the government of Illyria with two legions but this also was refused him a fatal obstinacy had seized the senate who were willing to sacrifice all his power to encrease that of their present favourite so that they attempted to repress his injustice by still greater of their own Wherefore Caesar now finding all hopes of an accommodation fruitless and conscious if not of the goodness of his cause at least of the goodness of his troops began to draw them down towards the confines of Italy and passing the Alps with his third legion stopt at Ravenra a city of Cisalpine Gaul from whence he once more wrote a letter to the consuls declaring that he was ready to resign all command in case Pompey did so too But he added that if all power was to be given to one only he would endeavour to prevent so unjust a distribution and declared that if they persisted he would shortly arrive in Rome to punish their injustice and the wrongs of his country The menaces contained in the last part of his letter exasperated the whole body of the senate against him Marcellus the consul who as we have said was the creature of Pompey gave way to his rage while Lentulus his colleague who being of wrecked fortune could expect to lose nothing by a civil war  openly declared that after such an insult further deliberation was needless and that there was now more occasion for arms than for suffrages It was then after some opposition decreed that Caesar should lay down his government and disband his forces within a limited time and if he refused obedience that he should be declared an enemy to the commonwealth They next gave orders to the consuls that the commonwealth would receive no damage which was the form of investing them with absolute authority in cases of immediate danger After this they appointed Domitius a man of great courage and abilities as Caesar's successor in the government of Gaul Pompey was ordered to put himself at the head of what troops were in readiness and all those who were under the influence either of him or the senate prepared to take up arms at Rome  In the mean time they who had declared themselves most strongly in Caesar's interest began to fear for themselves from the absolute power granted the consuls of disposing all things at their pleasure and of treating whom they would as enemies to the state But particularly Curio with the two tribunes Marcus Antonius and Longinus supposed they had reason to be apprehensive They accordingly fled disguised as slaves to Caesar's camp deploring the injustice and tyranny of the senate  and making a merit of their sufferings in his cause Caesar shewed them in the habits which they had thus assumed to his army and seeming touched with the strongest compassion at their treatment burst out into severe invectives against the senate alledging their tyranny over the state their cruelty to his friends and their flagrant ingratitude to himself for all his past services These cried he pointing to the tribunes who were in slaves habits these are the rewards obtained by the faithful servants of their country men whose persons are sacred by their office and whose characters have been esteemed for their virtues are driven from their country obliged for safety to appear as the meanest of mankind to find protection only in a distant province of the empire and all for maintaining the rights of freedom those rights which even Sylla in all the rage of slaughter durst not violate All this he enforced with the most passionate gestures and accompanied his words with his tears The soldiers as if inspired with one mind cried out that they were prepared to follow him wherever he should lead and were ready to die or revenge his injuries An universal acclamation rung through the whole camp every man prepared for a new service of danger and forgetting the toils of ten former campaigns went to his tent to meditate on future victory  When the army was thus fit for his purpose Caesar at nightfall sat down to table chearfully conversing with his friends on subjects of literature and philosophy and apparently disengaged from every ambitious concern however after some time rising up he desired the company to make themselves chearful in his absence and that he would be with them in a moment in the mean time having ordered his chariot to be prepared he immediately set out attended by a few friends for Arminium a city upon the confines of Italy whither he had dispatched a part of his army the morning before This journey by night which was very fatiguing▪ he performed with great diligence sometimes walking and sometimes on horseback 'till at the break of day he came up with his army which consisted of about five thousand men near the Rubicon a little river which separates Italy from Gaul and which terminated the limits of his command The Romans had ever been taught to consider this river as the sacred boundary of their domestic empire the senate had long before made an edict which is still to be seen engraven in the road near Rimini by which they solemnly devoted to the infernal gods and branded with sacrilege and parricide any person who should presume to pass the Rubicon with an army a legion or even a single cohort Caesar therefore when he advanced at  the head of his army to the side of the river stopt short upon the bank as if imprest with terror at the greatness of his enterprize The dangers he was to encounter the slaughters that were to ensue the calamities of his native city all presented themselves to his imagination in gloomy perspective and struck him with remorse He pondered for some time in fixt melancholy looking upon the river and debating with himself whether he should venture in  "If I pass this river says he to one of his generals who stood by him what miseries shall I bring upon my country and if I now stop short I am undone"  Thus saying and resuming all his former alacrity he plunged in crying out that the die was cast and all was now over his soldiers followed him with equal promptitude and quickly arriving at Arminium made themselves masters of the place without any resistance  This unexpected enterprize excited the utmost terrors in Rome every one imagining that Caesar was leading his army to lay the city in ruins At one time were to be seen the citizens flying into the country for safety and the inhabitants of the country coming up to seek for shelter in Rome In this universal confusion Pompey felt all that repentance and selfcondemnation which must necessarily arise from the remembrance of having advanced his rival to  his present pitch of power wherever he appeared many of his former friends were ready to tax him with his supineness and sarcastically to reproach his illgrounded presumption  "Where is now cried Favonius a ridiculous senator of his party the army that is to rise at your command let us see if it will appear by stamping"  Cato reminded him of the many warnings he had given him which however as he was continually boding nothing but calamities Pompey might very justly be excused from attending to But being at length wearied with these reproaches which were offered under colour of advice he did all that lay in his power to encourage and confirm his followers he told them that they should not want an army for that he would be their leader he confest indeed that he had all along mistaken Caesar's aims judging of them only from what they ought to be however if his friends were still inspired with the love of freedom they might yet enjoy it in whatever place their necessities should happen to conduct them He let them know that their affairs were in a very promising situation that his two lieutenants were at the head of a considerable army in Spain composed of veteran troops that had made the conquest of the East besides these there were infinite resources both in Asia and Africa together with the succours  they were sure to expect from all the kingdoms that were in alliance with Rome This speech served in some measure to revive the hopes of the confederacy The greatest part of the senate his own private friends and dependants together with all those who expected to make their fortunes in his cause agreed to follow him Thus being in no capacity of resisting Caesar at Rome he resolved to lead his forces to Capua where he had the two legions that commanded under Caesar in Gaul His parting from Rome was not a little distressful to the spectators Antient senators respectable magistrates and many of the flower of the young nobility obliged thus to leave their native city defenceless to the invader raised an universal concern in all ranks of people who followed them some way with outcries tears and wishes for their success  Caesar in the mean time after having vainly attempted to bring Pompey to an accommodation was resolved to pursue him into Capua before he could have time to collect his forces However at the very outset he was in some measure discouraged by the defection of Labienus associate of all his former victories this general either disgusted at his command or unwilling to desolate his native country went over to the other side but Caesar who was not to be intimidated by the loss of one  man whose abilities he himself was able to replace did not seem much to regard it wherefore sending all his money after him he marched on to take possession of the cities that lay between him and his rival not regarding Rome which he knew would fall of course to the conqueror Corfinium was the first city that attempted to stop the rapidity of his march It was defended by Domitius who had been appointed by the senate to succeed him in Gaul and was garrisoned by twenty cohorts which were levied in the countries adjacent Caesar however quickly invested it and though Domitius sent frequently to Pompey exhorting him to come and raise the siege be was at last obliged to endeavour to escape privately His intentions happening to be divulged the garrison were resolved to consult their own safety by delivering him up to the besiegers Caesar readily accepted their offers but kept his men from immediately entering into the town After some time Lentulus the consul who was one of the besieged came out to implore forgiveness for himself and the rest of his confederates putting Caesar in mind of their ancient friendship and acknowledging the many favours he had received at his hands to this Caesar who would not wait the conclusion of his speech generously replied that he came into Italy not to injure the liberties of  Rome and it's citizens but to restore them This humane reply being quickly carried into the city the senators and the knights with their children and some officers of the garrison came out to claim the conqueror's protection who just glancing at their ingratitude gave them their liberty with permission to go wheresoever they should think proper But while he dismist the leaders he upon this as upon all other occasions took care to attach the common soldiers to his own interest sensible that he might stand in need of an army but that while he lived his army could never stand in need of a commander  Pompey having intelligence of what past upon this occasion immediately retreated to Brundusium where he resolved to stand a siege to delay the enemy until the forces of the empire should be united to oppose him Caesar as he expected soon arrived before the place and having accidentally taken one of Pompey's engineers a prisoner he gave him liberty with orders to persuade his general that it might be for the interests of both as well as to the advantage of the empire to have an interview but to this overture he received no return He next attempted to block up the harbour but in this being frustrated by the diligence of Pompey he sent another proposal for having an interview to which it was answered that no propositions of that  kind could be received in the absence of the consuls Thus seeing no hopes of concluding their disagreements by treaty he turned all his thoughts towards carrying on the war which Pompey on his side resolved to prosecute with all imaginable vigour  His first aim in keeping Caesar some time employed before Brundusium succeeded to his wish he at length therefore prepared with all imaginable caution to abandon the town and transport his garrison over to Dyracchium where the consuls who had been sent with a part of the troops before him were levying men for the service of the empire For this purpose having fortified the harbour in such a manner that the enemy could not easily pursue him he embarked his troops with the utmost silence and dispatch leaving only a few archers and slingers on the walls who were ordered to retreat in small boats provided for that purpose as soon as all the heavy infantry were got on board Caesar being apprized of their retreat by the inhabitants of the town who were provoked at the ruin of their houses immediately attempted to prevent the embarkation and was actually going to lead his men over a pitfall which Pompey had secretly placed in his way had he not been interrupted by the townsmen who apprized him of his danger Thus did Pompey with great skill and diligence  make his escape leaving the whole kingdom of Italy at the mercy of his rival without either a town or an army that had strength to oppose his progress  Caesar finding he could not follow Pompey for want of shipping resolved to go back to Rome and take possession of the public treasures which his opponent by a most unaccountable over sight had neglected taking with him It might have been alledged indeed that as these treasures were considered as a sacred deposit and only to be used in the last extremity or in case of a Gallic invasion it would have been wrong in Pompey to begin his operations with an act of impiety Thus it often happens that the weaker side through a fear of discrediting their cause by any thing irregular ruin it by unseasonable moderation Caesar was received at Rome with the repeated acclamations of the lower part of the citizens and by all his own party those of the senate also who were attached to his interests assembled to congratulate his arrival to whom he made a plausible speech justifying his conduct and professing his aversion to the violent measures to which he had been compelled Then under a pretence that his cause was that of justice and of the commonwealth he prepared to possess himself of those treasures which had been laid up for the uses of the public but upon his coming up to the door of the treasury Metellus  the tribune who guarded it refused to let him pass alledging that the money was sacred and that horrible imprecations had been denounced against such as touched it upon any occasion but that of a Gallic war Caesar however was not to be intimidated by his superstitious remonstrances observing that there was no occasion for money to carry on a Gallic war as he had entirely subdued all Gaul already the tribune then pretending that the keys were missing Caesar ordered his attendants to break open the doors but Metellus had still the boldness to dispute even this command whereupon Caesar with more than usual emotion laying his hand upon his sword threatened to strike him dead  "And know young man cried he that it is easier to do this than to say it"  This menace had it's effect Metellus retired and Caesar took out to the amount of three thousand pound weight of gold besides an immense quantity of silver which money was a principal means of promoting his succeeding conquests Having thus provided for continuing the war he departed from Rome resolved to subdue Pompey's lieutenants Afranius and Petreius who had been long in Spain at the head of a veteran army  Much had been expected by the opposite party from the army in Spain it was composed of the choicest legions of the empire and had  been ever victorious under all its commanders▪ Caesar however who knew the abilities of its two present generals jocosely said as he was preparing to go thither that he went to fight an army without a general and upon conquering it would return to fight a general without an army However it may be enquired why Caesar did not rather pursue Pompey directly than thus step out of the way as it were into Spain to engage his generals He had good reasons he was sensible that if he had overcome Pompey and driven him out of Greece where he was then making preparations he must probably have forced him into Spain where of all places he dreaded most to meet him it was therefore prudent first to destroy the army there and then there was little to be dreaded from the protection it might afterwards afford Accordingly having refreshed his men previous to their setting out he led them once more a long and fatiguing march across the Alps through the extensive provinces of Gaul to meet the enemy in Spain Indeed when I consider the amazing length of the way and the various countries his soldiers were to pass the mountains they had to ascend and the forests to cut through the various climates they were to endure and the military duties they were to undergo while every centinel wore seventy pounds weight of armour that would be considered as a modern man's load  while besides this each man was obliged to carry with him ten days provision upon the point of his spear and was allowed nothing to drink but vinegar and water on the way when I consider I say the fatigues these must have undergone and the length of their continuance I am struck with astonishment at their invincible patience and resolution Caesar having left one of his generals with a part of the army to besiege Marseilles which refused to admit him he proceeded with extreme diligence on his march to Spain and to attach his men more firmly to his interests borrowed money from all his officers which he distributed among the soldiers Thus engaging the one to him by his liberality and the other by the expectation of being repaid  The first conflict which he had with Afranius and Petreius was rather unfavourable It was fought near the city of Herda and both sides claimed the honour of the victory Nevertheless it appeared soon after that Caesar was reduced to great streights for want of provisions which the overflowing of the river and the position of the enemy entirely cut off However nothing was able to subdue his dilligence and activity for causing slight boats covered with leather to be made and causing a division of the enemy to another part he carried his boats in waggons twenty miles distant from the camp  launched them upon the broadest part of the river and with great dexterity caused his legions to pass over Having thus gained new supplies of provisions and men he made a feint as if he intended to distress the enemy in turn by cutting off their supplies and for this purpose be began to throw up entrenchments and cut ditches as if to turn the course of the river into a different channel These preparations so intimidated the enemy that they resolved to decamp by night but Caesar who had intimation of their design by his spies pursued them with a small part of his army and forcing them to ford the river before they had time to rally on the other side appeared with the main body of his forces to receive them Thus hemmed in on both sides they could neither get forward nor return to their former camp By these means he reduced them to such extremity of hunger and drought that they were obliged to yield at discretion But clemency was his favourite virtue he dismissed them all with the kindest professions and sent them home to Rome loaden with shame and obligations to publish his virtues and confirm the affections of his adherents Thus in the space of about forty days he became master of all Spain and then departing to his army at Marseilles obliged that city to surrender at discretion He pardoned the inhabitants as he said chiefly upon account of their name and antiquity  and leaving two legions in that garrison returned again victorious to Rome The citizens upon this occasion received him with fresh demonstrations of joy they created him dictator and consul but the first of these offices he laid down after he had held it but eleven days His design in accepting it was probably to shew the people with what readiness he could resign it  While Caesar was thus employed Pompey was equally active in making preparations in Epirus and Greece to oppose him All the monarchs of the East had declared in his favour and sent very large supplies He was master of nine effective Italian legions and had a fleet of five hundred large ships under the conduct of Bibulus an active and experienced commander Added to these he was supplied with large sums of money and all the necessaries for an army from the tributary provinces round him He had attacked Dolabella and Anthony who commanded for Caesar in that part of the empire with such success that the former was obliged to fly and the latter was taken prisoner Crowds of the most distinguished citizens and nobles from Rome came every day to join him He had at one time above two hundred senators in his camp▪ among whom were Cicero and Cato whose approbation of his cause was equivalent to an army These assisted him with their countenance and advice and by their influence  it was determined that no Roman citizen should be put to death out of battle and that no town subject to the Roman empire should be plundered by the conquerors All these advantages both of strength and council drew the wishes of mankind to his cause and raised an opposition that threatened Caesar with speedy destruction  Notwithstanding such preparations against him Caesar proceeded with his usual vigour and with a courage that to ordinary capacities might seem to be rashness He now resolved to face his rival in the East and led his forces to Brundusium a sea port town of Italy in order to transport them into Greece but he wanted a fleet numerous enough to carry the whole at once and it appeared dangerous to weaken his army by dividing it besides it was now in the midst of winter and very difficult for any vessels much more for so slight a fleet as his was to keep the sea added to this all the ports and the shores were filled with the numerous navy of his rival conducted by a very vigilant commander However these considerations could not overrule his desire to pursue the war with his usual unremitting assiduity wherefore he shipped off five of his twelve legions which amounted to no more than twenty thousand foot and six thousand horse and weighing anchor fortunately steered through the midst of his enemies  timing it so well that he made his passage in one day He landed at a place called Pharsalus not daring to venture into any known port which he was apprehensive might be possessed by the enemy When he saw his troops safely debarked he sent back the fleet to bring over the rest of his forces but thirty of his ships in their return fell into the hands of Pompey's admiral who set them all on fire destroying mariners and all in order to intimidate the rest by this cruel example In the mean time he was employed in taking possession of such towns as had declared for his enemy and in cutting off provisions from the fleet which coasted along that part of the country But still convinced that the proper time for making proposals for a peace was after gaining an advantage he sent one Rufus whom he had taken prisoner to effect an accommodation with Pompey offering to refer all to the senate and people of Rome but Pompey once more rejected the overture holding the people of Rome too much in Caesar's interests to be relied on  He was raising supplies in Macedonia when first informed of Caesar's landing upon the coasts of Epirus he now therefore resolved immediately to march to Dyracchium in order to cover that place from Caesar's attempts as all his ammunition and provisions were deposited there Upon his arrival at that city he began  to perceive that many of his newraised troops were very little to be depended upon their slowness in obeying command and their numerous desertions giving him very disagreeable apprehensions In consequence of this he obliged them to take an oath that they would never abandon their general but follow him through all his fortunes and being thus secure of their attachment he resolved to harrass out his rival by protracting the war as his resources were more numerous than those of Caesar The first place that both armies came in sight of each other was on the opposite banks of the river Apsus and as both were commanded by the two greatest generals then in the world the one renowned for his conquest of the East the other celebrated for his victories over the Western parts of the empire a battle was eagerly desired by the soldiers on either side But neither general was willing to hazard it upon this occasion Pompey could not rely upon his new levies and Caesar would not venture an engagement till he was joined by the the rest of his forces Accordingly both armies remained in this disposition for some days looking upon each other with all the anxiety of suspense yet each with equal confidence of success and mutual resolution  Caesar had now waited some time with extreme impatience for the coming up of the remainder  of his army the whole of his hopes depended upon that reinforcement and he had written and sent several times to his generals to use dispatch At last despairing of their punctuality and desirous of being freed from the anxiety of expectation he resolved upon an attempt that nothing but the extraordinary confidence he had in his good fortune could excuse He disguised himself in the habit of a slave and with all imaginable secrecy went on board a fisherman's bark at the mouth of the river Apsus with a design to pass over to Brundusium where the rest of his forces lay and to conduct them over in person He accordingly rowed off in the beginning of the night and was got a considerable way to sea when the wind all of a sudden changed against him the sea now rose in billows of formidable height and the storm began to encrease with much violence The fisherman who had rowed all night with great labour was often for returning but was dissuaded by his passenger but at length when far advanced on the intended voyage he found himself unable to proceed and yet too distant from land to hope for making good his return in this interval of despondence he was going to give up the oar and commit himself to the mercy of the waves when Caesar at last discovering himself commanded him to row boldly Fear nothing cried he you carry Caesar  and his fortune Encouraged by the presence of so great a man the fisherman made fresh endeavours and got out to sea but the storm encreasing still against them he was obliged to make for land which was effected not without great difficulty As soon as he was on shore Caesar's soldiers who had for some time missed their general and knew not what was become of him came joyfully round him congratulating his escape and kindly upbraiding his attempt in so far distrusting their courage and affection as to seek out new forces when they were sure without any aid to conquer His excuses were not less tender than their remonstrances but the joy of both was soon after still heightened by an information of the landing of the troops he had long expected at Appollonia from whence they were approaching under the conduct of Anthony and Calenus to join him he therefore decamped in order to meet them and prevent if possible Pompey with his army from engaging them on their march as he lay on that side of the river where the succours had been obliged to come on shore This diligence was not less successful than necessary for Pompey had actually made some motions to anticipate their junction and had laid an ambuscade for Anthony which failing  e was obliged to retreat under an apprehension of being hemmed in between the two armies  so that the junction was effected the same day  Pompey being compelled to retreat led his forces to Asparagus nigh Dyracchium where he was sure of being supplied with every thing necessary for his army by the numerous fleets which he employed along the coasts of Epirus there he pitched his camp upon a tongue of land as mariners express it that jutted into the sea where also was a small shelter for ships where few winds could annoy them in this place being most advantageously situated he immediately began to entrench his camp which Caesar perceiving and finding that he was not likely soon to quit so advantageous a post began to entrench also behind him causing magazines of corn to be made in all parts not already wasted by the enemy's forces Yet notwithstanding all his care provisions began to be very scarce in Caesar's army his men were obliged to make use of beans and barley and a root called Chara which they mingled with milk but they had been long used to greater hardships than these so that they bore all with their accustomed patience remembering what great honours they had often gained after a course of such miseries as these The inconveniencies that were like to follow however put Caesar upon a new design All beyond Pompey's camp towards the land side was hilly and  steep wherefore Caesar built redoubts upon the hills stretching round from shore to shore and then caused lines of communication to be drawn from hill to hill by which he blocked up the camp of the enemy He hoped by this blockade to force the enemy to a battle which he ardently desired and which the other declined with equal industry Not indeed but Pompey was continually and earnestly sollicited by his officers and the senators attending his camp to hazard a battle but he knew too well the danger of such an attempt and accordingly thought only of harrassing out the enemy by perseverance Thus both sides continued for some time employed in designs and stratagems the one to annoy and the other to defend Caesar's men daily carried on their works to straiten the enemy those of Pompey did the same to enlarge themselves having the advantage of numbers and though they declined coming to a battle yet they severely galled the enemy by their slingers and archers Caesar however was indefatigable he caused blinds or mantelets to be made of skins of beasts to cover his men while at work he cut off all the water that supplied the enemy's camp and forage from the horses so that there remained no more subsistance for them In this situation Pompey at last resolved to break through his lines and gain some other  part of the country more convenient for encampment Accordingly having informed himself of the condition of Caesar's fortifications from some deserters who came over to him he ordered his light infantry and archers on board his ships with directions to attack Caesar's entrenchments by sea where they were least defended This was done with such effect that all the centurions of Caesar's first cohort were cut off except one and though Caesar and his officers used their utmost endeavours to hinder Pompey's designs yet by means of reiterated attempts he at last effected his purpose of extricating his army from his former camp and of encamping in another place by the sea where he had the conveniency of forage and shipping also Caesar being thus frustrated in his views of blocking up the enemy and perceiving the loss he had sustained resolved at last to force Pompey to a battle though upon disadvantageous terms The engagement began by attempting to cut off a legion of the enemy which was posted in a wood and this brought on a general battle The conflict was for some time carried on with great ardour and with equal fortune but Caesar's army being intangled in the entrenchments of the old camps lately abandoned began to fall into disorder upon which Pompey pressing his advantage they at last fled with great precipitation Great  numbers perished in the trenches and on the banks of the river pressed to death by their fellows Pompey pursued his successes to the very camp of Caesar and now was the crisis of Caesar's fate it only depended upon the resolution and perseverance of Pompey's men to attack his entrenchments and utterly destroy his whole army but his usual good fortune prevailed Pompey either surprized with the suddenness of his victory or fearful of an ambuscade withdrew his troops into his own camp and thus lost the empire of the world However his generals and attendants looked upon his present success as a decisive determination of the war Not thinking of future engagements and dangers they carried themselves as undoubted conquerors and adding cruelty to their confidence put all their prisoners to the sword Caesar however was not to be intimidated by a single blow he found that hitherto his attempts to force Pompey to engage him upon equal terms were ineffectual he therefore resolved to appear as if willing to change the whole course of the war and to protract it in his turn wherefore calling the army together he addressed them with his usual calmness and intrepidity in the following manner  "We have no reason my fellow soldiers to be dejected at our late miscarriage the loss of one battle after such numbers that  have been gained should rather awaken out caution than depress our resolution let us remember the long course of victories which have been gained by us in Gaul Britain Italy and Spain and then let us consider how many greater dangers we have escaped which have only served to encrease the pleasure of succeeding victory If after all these renowned exploits and glorious successes one little disorder one error of inadvertancy or indeed of destiny itself has deprived us of our just reward yet we have still sufficient force to ensure it for the future and though we should be deprived of every resource yet the brave have one still left to overcome every danger namely to despise it"  After thus encouraging his men and degrading some of his subaltern officers who were remiss in their duty he prepared to lead his forces from their camp and to make his retreat to Appollonia where he intended to refresh and recruit his army Having therefore caused his baggage to go on before he marched after at the head of his soldiers and though pursued by Pompey yet having the advantage of setting off eight hours before him he effected his intent  In the mean time Domitius one of his lieutenants was in Macedonia with three legions and in danger of being surprized by the superior forces of the enemy he resolved therefore to  join him with all expedition and after having refreshed his army set forward with the utmost dispatch Pompey was in pretty much the same circumstances of apprehension for Scipio one of his lieutenants who was in Thessaly at the head of the Syrian legion and he was fearful lest Caesar's march was intended to cut off this body of troops before their junction Thus each general marched with all the diligence possible both to secure their friends and surprize their enemies Caesar's dispatch was most successful he was joined by Domitius upon the frontiers of Thessaly and thus with all his forces united into one body he marched directly to Gomphi a town that lies farther within that province But the news of his defeat at Dyracchium had reached this place before him the inhabitants therefore who had before promised him obedience▪ now changed their minds and with a degree of baseness equal to their imprudence shut their gates against him Caesar was not to be injured with impunity wherefore having represented to his soldiers the great advantage of forcing a place so very rich he ordered the machines for scaling to be got ready and causing an assault to be made proceeded with such vigour that notwithstanding the great height of the walls the town was taken in a few hours time Caesar left it to be plundered and without delaying his march went forward to Metropolis  another town of the same province which yielded at his approach by this means he soon became possessed of all Thessaly except Larissa which was garrisoned by Scipio with his legion who commanded for Pompey  During this interval Pompey's officers being grown insupportably vain upon their late victory were continually soliciting their commander to come to a battle every delay became insupportable to them they presumed to assert that he was willing to make the most of his command and to keep the numerous body of senators and nobles that followed his fortunes still in subjection confident of victory they divided all the places in the government among each other and portioned out the lands of those whom in imagination they had already vanquished amongst each other Nor did revenge less employ their thoughts than ambition or avarice this was not confined to such only as had taken up arms against them but to all those who continued neuter and had yet sided with neither party The proscription was actually drawn up not for the condemnation of individuals but of whole ranks of the enemy it was even proposed that all the senators in Pompey's army should be appointed judges over such as had either actually opposed or by their neutrality had failed to assist their party Pompey being thus surrounded by men of weak  heads and eager expectations and incessantly teized with importunities to engage found himself too weak to oppose he resolved therefore at last to renounce his own judgment in compliance with those about him and to give up all schemes of prudence for those dictated by avarice and passion Wherefore advancing into Thessaly within a few days after the taking of Gomphi he drew down upon the plains of Pharsalia where he was joined by Scipio his lieutenant with the troops under his command Here he awaited the coming up of Caesar resolved upon engaging and upon deciding the fate of kingdoms at a single battle  Caesar had employed all his art for some time in sounding the inclinations of his men and providing for their safety in case of miscarriage but at length finding them resolute and vigorous he caused them to advance towards the plains of Pharsalia where Pompey was now encamped The approach of these two great armies composed of the best and bravest troops in the world together with the greatness of the prize for which they contended filled all minds with anxiety though with different expectations Pompey's army being most numerous turned all their thoughts to the enjoyment of the victory Caesar's with better aims considered only the means of obtaining it Pompey's army depended upon their numbers and their many  generals Caesar's upon their own discipline and the conduct of their single commander Pompey's partizans hoped much from the justice of their cause Caesar's alledged the frequent proposals which they had made for peace without effect thus the views hopes and motives of both seemed different but their hatred and ambition were the same Caesar who was ever foremost in offering battle led out his army in array to meet the enemy but Pompey either suspecting his troops or dreading the event kept his advantageous situation for some time he drew indeed sometimes out of his camp but always kept himself under his trenches at the foot of the hill near which he was posted Caesar being unwilling to attack him at a disadvantage resolved to decamp the next day hoping to harrass out his antagonist who was not a match for him in sustaining the fatigues of duty and in expectation that as the enemy would not fail following him he might find some happier opportunity of coming to an engagement Accordingly the order for marching was given and the tents struck when word was brought him that Pompey's army had quitted their entrenchments and had advanced further into the plain than usual so that he might engage them at less disadvantage This was the juncture that Caesar had so long wished for in vain ever since he had landed in Greece  he had been employed in endeavours to draw on a general engagement and feared nothing so much as to protract the war whereupon he now caused his troops that were upon their march to halt and with a countenance of joy informed them that the happy time was at last come which they had so long wished for and which was to crown their glory and terminate their fatigues After which he drew up his troops in order and advanced towards the place of battle His forces did not amount to above half those of Pompey the army of the one amounting to above fortyfive thousand foot and seven thousand horse that of the other not exceeding twentytwo thousand foot and about a thousand horse This disproportion particularly in the cavalry had filled Caesar with apprehensions wherefore he had some days before picked out the strongest and nimblest of his footsoldiers and accustomed them to fight between the ranks of his cavalry By their assistance his thousand horse was a match for Pompey's seven thousand and had actually got the better in a skirmish that happened between them some days before  Pompey on the other hand had strong expectations of success he boasted in council that he could put Caesar's legions to flight without striking a single blow presuming that as soon as the armies formed his cavalry  on which he placed his greatest expectations would outflank and surround the enemy Labienus commended this scheme of Pompey alledging also that the present troops of which Caesar's army was composed were but the shadow of those old legions that had fought in Britain and Gaul that all the veterans were worn out and had been replaced by new levies made in a hurry in Cisalpine Gaul To encrease the confidence of the army still more he took an oath which the rest followed him in never to return to the camp but with victory In this disposition and under these advantageous circumstances Pompey led his troops to battle  Pompey's order of battle was good and well judged In the centre and on the two flanks he placed all his veterans and distributed his newraised troops between the wings and the main body The Syrian legions were placed in the centre under the command of Scipio the Spaniards on whom he greatly relied were put on the right under Domitius Aenobarbus and on the left were stationed the two legions which Caesar had restored in the beginning of the war led on by Pompey himself because from thence he intended to make the attack which was to gain the day and for the same reason he had there assembled all his horse slingers and archers of which his right wing had no need being  covered by the river Enipeus Caesar likewise divided his army into three bodies under three commanders Domitius Calvinus being placed in the centre and Mark Anthony on the left while he himself led on the right wing which was to oppose the left commanded by Pompey It is remarkable enough that Pompey chose to put himself at the head of those troops which were disciplined and instructed by Caesar an incontestible proof how much he valued them above any of the rest of his army Caesar on the contrary placed himself at the head of his tenth legion that had owed all its merit and fame to his own training As he observed the enemy's numerous cavalry to be all drawn to one spot he guess'd at Pompey's intention to obviate which he made a draught of six cohorts from his rear line and forming them into a separate body concealed them behind his right wing with instructions not to throw their javelins on the approach of Pompey's horse as was customary but to keep them in their hands and push them directly in the faces and the eyes of the horsemen who being composed of the younger part of the Roman nobility valued themselves much upon their beauty and dreaded a scar in the face more than a wound in the body He lastly placed the little cavalry he had so as to cover the right of the tenth legion ordering his third line not to march 'till they  had received the signal from him And now the fate of the vast empire of Rome was to be decided by the greatest generals the bravest officers and the most expert troops that mankind had ever seen 'till that hour Each private man in both armies was almost capable of performing the duty of a commander and seemed inspired with a desire to conquer or die As the armies approached the two generals went from rank to rank encouraging their men warning their hopes and lessening their apprehensions Pompey represented to his men that the glorious occasion which they had long besought him to grant was now before them  "And indeed cried he what advantages could you wish over an enemy that you are not now possessed of Your numbers your vigour a late victory all assure a speedy and an easy conquest of those harrassed and broken troops composed of men worn out with age and imprest with the terrors of a recent defeat but there is still a stronger bulwark for our protection than the superiority of our strength the justice of our cause You are engaged in the defence of liberty and of your country you are supported by its laws and followed by its magistrates you have the world spectators of your conduct and wishing you success on the contrary he whom you oppose is a robber and oppressor of his country and almost  most already sunk with the consciousness of his crimes as well as the bad success of his arms Shew then on this occasion all that ardour and detestation of tyranny that should animate Romans and do justice to mankind"  Caesar on his side went among his men with that steady serenity for which he was so much admired in the midst of danger He insisted on nothing so strongly to his soldiers as his frequent and unsuccessful endeavours for peace He talked with terror of the blood he was going to shed and pleaded only the necessity that urged him to it He deplored the many brave men that were to fall on both sides and the wounds of his country whoever should be victorious His soldiers answered his speech with looks of ardour and impatience which observing he gave the signal to begin The word on Pompey's side was Hercules the invincible that on Caesar's Venus the victorious There was only so much space between both armies as to give room for fighting wherefore Pompey ordered his men to receive the first shock without moving out of their places expecting the enemies ranks to be put into disorder by their motion Caesar's soldiers were now rushing on with their usual impetuosity when perceiving the enemy motionless they all stopt short as if by general consent and halted in the midst of their  career A terrible pause ensued in which both armies continued to gaze upon each other with mutual terror and dreadful serenity at length Caesar's men having taken breath ran furiously upon the enemy first discharging their javelins and then drawing their swords The same method was observed by Pompey's troops who as vigorously sustained the attack His cavalry also were ordered to charge at the very onset which with the multitude of archers and slingers soon obliged Caesar's men to give ground and get themselves as he had foreseen upon the flank of his army whereupon Caesar immediately ordered the six cohorts that were placed as a reinforcement to advance and repeated his orders to strike at the enemies faces This had it's desired effect the cavalry that were but just now sure of victory received an immediate check the unusual method of fighting pursued by the cohorts their aiming entirely at the visages of the assailants and the horrible disfiguring wounds they made all contributed to intimidate them so much that instead of defending their persons their only endeavour was to save their faces A total route ensued of their whole body which fled in great disorder to the neighbouring mountains while the archers and slingers who were thus abandoned were cut to pieces Caesar now commanded the cohorts to pursue their success and  advancing charged Pompey's troops upon the flank this charge the enemy withstood for some time with great bravery 'till he brought up his third line which had not yet engaged Pompey's infantry being thus doubly attacked in front by fresh troops and in rear by the victorious cohorts could no longer resist but fled to their camp The flight began among the strangers though Pompey's right wing still valiantly maintained their ground Caesar however being convinced that the victory was certain with his usual clemency cried out to pursue the strangers but to spare the Romans upon which they all laid down their arms and received quarter The greatest slaughter was among the auxiliaries who fled on all quarters but principally went for safety to the camp The battle had now lasted from the break of day 'till noon the weather being extremely hot notwithstanding the conquerors did not remit their ardour being encouraged by the example of their general who thought his victory not complete till he was master of the enemy's camp Accordingly marching on foot at their head he called upon them to follow and strike the decisive blow The cohorts which were left to defend the camp for some time made a formidable resistance particularly a great number of Thracians and other barbarians who were appointed for it's defence but  nothing could resist the ardour of Caesar's victorious army they were at last driven from their trenches and all fled to the mountains not far off  Caesar seeing the field and camp strewed with his fallen countrymen was strongly affected at so melancholy a prospect and could not help crying out to one that stood near him  "They would have it so"  Upon entering the enemies camp every object presented fresh instances of the blind presumption and madness of his adversaries on all sides were to be seen tents adorned with ivy and branches of myrtle couches covered with purple and sideboards loaded with plate Every thing gave proofs of the highest luxury and seemed rather the preparative for a banquet the rejoicings for a victory than the dispositions for a battle A camp so richly furnished might have been able to engage the attention of any troops but Caesar's there was still something to be done and he would not permit them to pursue any other object than their enemies till they were entirely subdued A considerable body of these having retired to the adjacent mountains he prevailed on his soldiers to join him in the pursuit in order to oblige these to surrender he began by inclosing them with a line drawn at the foot of the mountain but they quickly abandoned a post which was not tenable for want of water  and endeavoured to reach the city of Larissa Caesar led a part of his army by a shorter way and intercepted their retreat drawing up in order of battle between them and the city However these unhappy fugitives once more found protection from a mountain at the foot of which a rivulet ran which supplied them with water Now night approaching Caesar's men were almost spent and ready to faint with their incessant toil since morning yet still he prevailed upon them once more to renew their labours and to cut off the rivulet that supplied them The fugitives thus deprived of all hopes of succour or subsistence sent deputies to the conqueror offering to surrender at discretion during this interval of negotiation a few senators that were among them took the advantage of the night to escape and the rest next morning gave up their arms and experienced the conqueror's clemency In fact he addressed them with great gentleness and forbade his soldiers to offer them any violence or to take any thing from them Thus Caesar by his conduct gained the most complete victory that had ever been obtained and by his great clemency after the battle seemed to have deserved it His loss amounted to but two hundred men that of Pompey to fifteen thousand as well Romans as auxiliaries twentyfour thousand men surrendered themselves prisoners  war and the greatest part of these entered into Caesar's army and were incorporated with the rest of his forces As to the senators and Roman knights who fell into his hands he generously gave them liberty to retire wherever they thought proper and as for the letters which Pompey had received from several persons who wished to be thought neutral he burnt them all without reading them as Pompey had done upon a former occasion Thus having performed all the duties of a general and a statesman he sent for the legions which had passed the night in the camp to relieve those which had accompanied him in the pursuit and being determined to follow Pompey began his march and arrived the same day at Larissa  As for Pompey who had formerly shewn such instances of courage and conduct when he saw his cavalry routed on which he had placed his sole dependance he absolutely lost his reason Instead of thinking how to remedy this disorder by rallying such troops as fled or by opposing fresh troops to stop the progress of the conquerors being totally amazed by this first blow he returned to the camp and in his tent waited the issue of an event which it was his duty to direct not to follow there he remained for some moments without speaking till being told that the camp was attacked  "What says he are we pursued to our very entrenchments"  and immediately quitting his armour for a habit more suited to his circumstances he fled away on horseback to Larissa from whence perceiving he was not pursued he slackened his pace giving way to all the agonizing reflections which his deplorable situation must naturally suggest In this melancholy manner he passed along the vale of Tempe and pursuing the course of the river Peneus at last arrived at a fisherman's hut in which he passed the night From thence he went on board a little bark and keeping along the seashore he descryed a ship of some burthen which seemed preparing to sail in which he embarked the master of the vessel still paying him the homage which was due to his former station From the mouth of the river Peneus he sailed to Amphipolis where finding his affairs desperate he steered to Lesbos to take in his wife Cornelia whom he had left there at a distance from the dangers and hurry of the war She who had long flattered herself with the hopes of victory felt the reverse of her fortune in an agony of distress she was desired by the messenger whose tears more than words proclaimed the greatness of her misfortunes to dispatch if she expected to see Pompey with but one ship and even that not his own her grief which before was violent became then insupportable she fainted away and lay a considerable time without  any signs of life At length recovering herself and reflecting it was now no time for vain lamentations she ran quite through the city to the seaside Pompey received her in his arms without speaking a word and for some time supported her in his arms in silent despair After a pause of long continuance they found words for their distress Cornelia imputed to herself a part of the miseries that were come upon them and instanced many former misfortunes of her life Pompey endeavoured to comfort her by instancing the uncertainty of human affairs and from his present unexpected wretchedness teaching her to hope for as unexpected turns of good fortune In the mean time the people of the island who had great obligations to Pompey gathered round them joining in their grief and inviting them into their city Pompey however declined their invitation and even advised them to submit to the conqueror  "Be under no apprehenhensions cried he Caesar may be my enemy but still let me acknowledge his moderation and humanity"  Cratippus the Greek philosopher also came to pay his respects Pompey as is but too frequent with persons under misfortunes complained to him of providence Cratippus who was a man of genius and understood the world declined entering deeply into the argument rather satisfied with supplying  new motives to hope than combating the present impiety of his despair  Having taken in Cornelia he now continued his course steering to the southeast and stopping no longer than was necessary to take in provisions at the ports that occurred in his passage He came before Rhodes but the people of this city were changed with his fortunes against him From thence he went to Attilia where he was joined by some soldiers and ships of war However these were nothing against the power of his rival from the activity of whose pursuit he was in continual apprehensions His forces were too much ruined and dispersed to be ever collected once more his only hopes therefore lay in the assistance of the kings who were in his alliance and from these only he could expect security and protection He was himself inclined to retire to the Parthians others proposed Juba king of Numidia but he was at last prevailed upon to apply to Ptolemy king of Egypt to whose father Pompey had been a considerable benefactor Accordingly he lest Cilicia where he then was and steering for the kingdom of Egypt came in view of the coasts of that country and sent to the young king to implore protection and safety Ptolemy who was as yet a minor had not the government in his own hands but he and his kingdom were under the protection of  Photinus an eunuch and Theodotus a master of the art of speaking Before these therefore Pompey's request was argued before such mean and mercenary persons was to be determined the fate of one who but a few days before had given law to kingdoms The opinions of the council were divided gratitude and pity inclined some to receive him whilst others more obdurate or more timorous were for denying him entrance into the kingdom At length Theodotus the rhetorician as if willing to display his eloquence maintained that both proposals were equally dangerous that to admit him was making Pompey their master and drawing on them Caesar's resentment and by not receiving him they offended the one' without obliging the other that therefore the only expedient left was to give him leave to land and then to kill him this would at once oblige Caesar and rid them of all apprehensions from Pompey's resentment for concluded he with a vulgar and malicious joke dead dogs can never bite This advice prevailing in a council composed of the slaves of an effeminate and luxurious court Achillas commander of the forces and Septimius by birth a Roman and who had formerly been a centurion in Pompey's army were appointed to carry it into execution Accordingly attended by three or four more they went into a little  bark and rowed off from land towards Pompey's ship that lay off about a mile from the shore When Pompey and his friends saw the boat moving off from shore they began to wonder at the meanness of the preparations to receive him and some even ventured to suspect the intentions of the Egyptian court But before any thing could be determined Achillas was come up to the ship's side and in the Greek language welcomed him to Egypt and invited him into the boat alledging that the shallows prevented larger vessels from coming off to receive him Pompey after having taken leave of Cornelia who wept at his departure and having repeated two verses of Sophocles signifying that he who trusts his freedom to a tyrant from that moment becomes a slave gave his hand to Achillas and stept into the bark with only two attendants of his own They had now rowed from the ship a good way and as during that time they all kept a profound silence Pompey willing to begin the discourse accosted Septimius whose face he recollected  "Methinks friend cried he that you and I were once fellow soldiers together"  Septimius gave only a nod with his head without uttering a word or instancing the least civility Pompey therefore took out a paper on which he had minuted a speech he intended to make the king and began reading it In this  manner they approached the shore and Cornelia whose concern had never suffered her to lose sight of her husband began to conceive hopes when she perceived the people on the strand crowding down along the coasts as if willing to receive him but her hopes were soon destroyed for that instant as Pompey rose supporting himself upon his freedman's arm Septimius stabbed him in the back and was instantly seconded by Achillas Pompey perceiving his death inevitable only disposed himself to meet it with decency and covering his face with his robe without speaking a word with a sigh resigned himself to his fate At this horrid sight Cornelia shrieked so loud as to be heard to the shore but the danger she herself was in did not allow the mariners time to look on they immediately set sail and the wind proving favourable fortunately they escaped the pursuit of the Egyptian gallies In the mean time Pompey's murderers having cut off his head caused it to be embalmed the better to preserve its features designing it for a present to Caesar The body was thrown naked on the strand and exposed to the view of all whose curiosity led them that way However his faithful freedman Philip still kept near it and when the crowd was dispersed he washed it in the sea and looking round for materials to burn it he perceived the wrecks of a fishing  boat of which he composed a pile While he was thus piously employed he was accosted by an old Roman soldier who had served under Pompey in his youth  "Who art thou said he that art making these humble preparations for Pompey's funeral"  Philip having answered that he was one of his freedmen  "Alas replied the soldier permit me to share in this honour also among all the miseries of my exile it will be my last sad comfort that I have been able to assist at the funeral of my old commander and touch the body of the bravest general that ever Rome produced"  After this they both joined in giving the corse the last rites and collecting his ashes buried them under a little rising earth scraped together with their hands over which was afterwards placed the following inscription  He whose merits deserved a temple can now scarce find a tomb  Such was the end and such the funeral of Pompey the Great a man who had many opportunities of enslaving his country but yet rejected them all He was fonder of glory than of power of praise rather than command and was more vain than ambitious His talents in war were every way superior to all the rest of his cotemporaries except Caesar it was therefore  peculiar misfortune to contend with a man in whose presence all other military merit lost  lustre Whether his aims during the  last war were more just than Caesar's must for ever remain doubtful certain it is that he frequently rejected all offers of accommodation and began to talk of punishment before he had any pretensions to power But whatever might have been his intentions in case of victory they could not have been executed with more moderation than those of Caesar The corruptions of the state were too great to admit of any other cure but that of an absolute government and it was not possible that power could have fallen into better hands than those of the conqueror From Pompey's death therefore we may date the total extinction of the republic From this period the senate was dispossessed of all its power and Rome from henceforward was never without
