 EPISTLES TO LORENZO  Nec tardum operior nec praecedentibus insto  LONDON  MDCCLVI  ADVERTISEMENT  THE following sheets contain part of several epistolary Rhimes written on different occasions in different parts of  Europe  The object of the whole would be  to reconcile within the bounds of moderation the Zealots Philosophers of the present age  The author is sensible the latter or as they are call'd the advocates for natural religion are the greater bigots of the two that a superstitious attachment to  infidelity  is the masterpiece of Enthusiasm the rapsodies of  Jacob Boehmen  being much more intelligible than the  plain demonstrations  of some modern  If the truth of this observation be call'd in question the reader may turn for conviction to a late pamphlet call'd  the Light of nature the light of the gospel  written by an author who for twenty years past has occasionally oblig'd the public with works of the same stamp  freethinkers  To the end propos'd therefore the means would be to establish on undisputed principles the certainty of those maxims which most affect the present future happiness of mankind  With this view it is necessary the author should wear an assum'd character propose nothing but what  Reason  common to all may allow In doing this then he would endeavour to shew the principal defects point out the limits of the  Understanding  to prove  a priori  the source of  good evil  the universal propriety of  original sin  the moral necessity of that inseparable connection between  Happiness misery Virtue    Vice  the  immortality  of the soul being at the same time pointed out from arguments universally acknowledg'd felt  Such is the general design of the author that of the present  publication  is to inform himself how far this specimen may give the  publick  room to think him capable of the whole or whether any part may be worth a finishing hand  By the  publick  also he would be understood to mean the philosophical part of the world only for as to the gentlemen of the  Belles Lettres  he does not willinigly subject himself to their Censure having chosen a poetical stile for no worse reason than an incapacity to express the same sentiments better in any other Confiding therefore in the wellbred humanity of such Critics he hopes they will not put his verses to the  Horatian torture  by pulling them to pieces to examine the  disjecta membra Poëtae  EPISTLE THE FIRST  to LORENZO  While zeal pursues beyond the Grave  Whom Priest nor Patriot could save  Lost  St John  sav'd and damn'd by Fame  An honour'd a blasted Name  Lorenzo  asks ingenuous Youth  What is who beleives the  truth  Lorenzo  wouldst thou learn of me  Truth  is where all the world agree  Is there no point where all unite  I answer none are in the right  Yet wouldst thou know so Skepticks err  To whom enquiry may refer  Where trembling doubt error blind  At once a guard guide may find  At once successfully apply  And give to Falsehood's face the Lye  Alass denied the perfect rule  That serves alike the Knave Fool  Alike the Ignorant the Wise  Adoring these what those despise  Whether we judge from Nature's Law  That  Truth  infallibly we draw  Or think the just Criterion given  In Revelation pure from Heaven  It differs not unless we find  Some active index in the mind  Some Ray of Heaven's unerring light  To guide in this or that aright  Let  Christianity  display  It's wond'rous Volume to the day  The sacred lines however true  Alike affect not me you  Th' accepted sense of holy writ  Still resting on th' accepting wit  For who that read but comprehend  As taught by Father Priest or Friend  Or tenets new more nice than wise  Peculiar to themselves devise  How then prevails the sacred text  If by the comment thus perplex'd  If Hereticks of ev'ry kind  Still in the  word  their  Gospel  find  Still if the  spirit  hides the flaw  That marrs the  letter  of the  Law  Let  Nature  's striking scenes engage  The letter'd unletter'd Age  No fix'd Ideas yet we find  Convey'd from hence to Humankind  When meteors shine or Comets blaze  Behold the wond'ring  Crito  gaze  Prognosticate in error wise  The Judgments gathering in the skies  Th'  Aurora  streaming from the Pole  What mighty fears his Heart controul  See him confess his angry God  And dread his mercies as his rod  Whilst thou Blasphemer  Crito  cries  Liftst up thine hand against the skies  Fearless in Scientific pride  On the wild whirlwind's wings wouldst ride  When Thunder splits the Clouds in twain  Or Lightnings melt them into Rain  'Gainst Heaven itself so mad to arm  In magick steel you brave the storm  With  Franklin  impiously defie  The Thunderers red right arm on high  Bold Titan take your mounted stand  To wrest the Light'nings from his hand  Thus by no certain instinct led  We comprehend what's seen or read  But from unlike experience taught  Peculiar are our modes of thought  Dost pause when Pleas of  right  or  wrong  To captious opponents belong  While  this  affirm'd or  that  denied  With equal force on either side  Avoid  Lorenzo  vain dispute  'Tis empty triumph to confute  No Honour whets the  Champion's  Blade  Truth  warms no Casuist by Trade  See the wing'd Cork from side to side  Rebound the truant school boy's pride  With equal warmth with equal noise  So  Disputants  like truant Boys  Between what  Saint  or  Father  saith  Bang the light  Shittlecock  of  Faith  Our first mistake  Lorenzo  this  All on their  faith  wou'd found their bliss  And here while flattering hope depends  To  truth  presumptuous  faith  pretends  Thus  contradictions  are profess'd  Yet  truth  must be to all the test  But tell me what connection ties  So close the Happy and the Wise  Ah what avails the  Truth  to know  When  Truth  the frequent source of woe  While gilded  Fiction's  flattering rays  With sunshine beautifie our days  Or mildly shed it's silver beams  Reflected light our nightly dreams  While  Pleasure  it's laughing train  Dance by the Moonshine of the brain  From hence doth bliss or misery flow  The truth to know or not to know  For bliss in vain the Learn'd explore  Swift as their search it flies before  Thro' ev'ry Clime on ev'ry wind  And leaves their panting wish behind  O say what truth doth science reach  The Infant's peace of mind to teach  O say what truth shall faith receive  Exclusive happiness to give  In  Pope  or  Mufti  what is given  But fear of Hell hope of Heaven  A view of future bliss or woe  The guiding prospect here below  If promis'd then Seraphick skies  Or  Osman's  sensual Paradise  Or with the  Indian  taught t'ascend  To converse with a former friend  Still if the tenet moves to act  Words Opinions bow to Fact  To  truth  or  Knowledge  unconfin'd  The  Bliss  or  Woe  of Humankind  As happy those who blindly trust  In Pope or Mufti if as just  No more requir'd by gracious Heaven  Than to requiring Man is given  Let  Calvin  then selecting rave  Or  Luther  souls unsorted save  Or  Peter's heir  deny the Keys  Of Heav'n to Hereticks like these  Rejecting thou the vain abuse  Know ev'ry System hath it's use  Or new or old or yours or mine  Subservient all to Heav'ns design  Tho'  truth  from each be distant far  As  Good hope  from the  Polar  star  As parts to complex Engines prove  Inspir'd by Mechanism to move  This  retrogade  that  direct  In diff'rent modes to one effect  So these or moral or divine  In  nature's  grand machine combine  Machine how vast how lost is man  In  nature's  wonderworking plan  The reason thiswe ever drew  Of  Nature  a perspective view  Fix'd to  one Station  Time place  In power no just  survey  to trace  So individuals also draw  Their eye their rule their will their law  No wonder then that  wrong    right  Perplex from various points of Sight  That widely diff'rent both appear  If view'd from thence or seen from here  Place  lights  with art the  shades  between  And black white the varying scene  At points oppos'd each strikes the eyes  And  this  affirms what  that  denies  The demonstration of his Sight  Who doubts who knows not black from white  The proofs of both exactly suit  And evidence supports dispute  How madly then the world agree  To rave at alien Heresy  Heirs to Religion's brighter sphere  How strangely damn'd damning here  Halfwitted Zeal of all the test  Itself condemning with the rest  By Sampson's rage so thousands lost  Fell but at  blinded Sampson's  cost  Lorenzo  is't thyself to please  Dost covet  truth  in hopes of  ease  Woulds't thou of future bliss or woe  Secure thy hopes and fears below  Be  truth  no more thy ardent search  Behold thy  nostrum  in the Church  Faith  by indulgent Heaven design'd  To help the weak to lead the blind  To check the rash to warn the bold  T'affright the young t'amuse the old  From our ownselves ourselves to save  And bring us smiling to the Grave  Ask'st thou what  Church  by each confest  His own superior to the rest  Enquire of allof all enquir'd  Their  medium  is the term desir'd  Dost thou require this term of me  Go seek it in  Conformity  At  London Pekin  or  Peru  A constant rule for ever true  From hence deduce that  golden mean  Each daggerdrawing Church between  Nor doubt if here thou fixest right  In  half their difference  all unite  Their half of difference if unknown  Will  Moderation  make thine own  Hard is the task advent'rous Youth  And bold thy enterprize for  truth  Yet canst thou  bliss  or  ease  forego  And burns thy bosom but to  know  Hast in thine earlier hours been taught  The gen'rous fortitude of thought  To set blind prejudice apart  To rend  th'old Woman  from the Heart  To damn tradition's idle rules  The Mother the Nurse of Fools  Th' ingenuous muse shall lead the way  Safe in the theme tho' rude the lay  Truth  hopes not for poetic praise  To  Fiction  sacred are the Bays  EPISTLE THE SECOND  to LORENZO  Rul'd by no giant hopes or fears  Whose stature grows with length of years  In search of  Truth  expect to find  The labour suited to the mind  With genius  Nature  bearing part  The strict yet gentle nurse of  art  For aim not thou a point to hit  Beyond the reach of human wit  Or join  Lorenzo  blindly those  Who first would  Nature's God  disclose  For say the voice of  reason  true  Be ours a just abstracted view  Be it the priviledge of man  To trace exactly  Nature's  plan  The scale of Beings in his hands  To know the point at which he stands  Compar'd with all he boasts to know  As well above him as below  Yet if of human logick vain  He links to Heav'n a kindred chain  Man his conclusions idly draws  And  Heav'n  prescribes by  human  laws  Imagine thou in what degree  A  Seraph  stands 'tween  God thee  Conceive thyself a  mite  unseen  And  Being infinite  between  In this Comparison says Pride  A  Seraph  thou to  God  allied  Thy Pride  Lorenzo  disbeleive  Let  Locke  nor  Addison  deceive  For tho'  Creation's  varied plan  Assigns degrees respecting  man  Yet  Skeptick  know learn to fear  God  is beyond thy proper Sphere  Created  Beings  all his care  Doth he with them Creation  share  Ah no the System all our own  God  the Creator stands alone  At equal distance all his plan  The mite the Seraph or the Man  Is it not so the passive clay  Of yon Corinthian Column gay  That gilt entablature or base  Or marble of yon shining vase  Resemble more the artist's mind  Than if to meaner use consign'd  Absurd is  Jones's  genius known  By the great model or the stone  The Pile erect to  Trajan's  name  Affected not by empty fame  The Cross rever'd the honour'd Bust  And trodden floor are kindred dust  For all in one degree respect  Their sov'reign Lord the  Architect  How justly then so e'er we plead  That Reason nature's book doth read  As by it's known written laws  Of each  effect  we trace the  cause  Those laws can ne'er themselves confine  The legislative Pow'r divine  Whose will that order first decreed  And bade th' effect the cause succeed  Agent by some  superior scheme  Of which in this we can but dream  Bear  Atticus  the Critick's rod  In vain we then define a  God  In vain we attributes bestow  Or reason here from what we know  Tho' Science teach religion warm  What wild Ideas still we form  Incongruous embrios of the brain  That strive to scale the Heav'ns in vain  Too short to reach beyond the sky  The focus of the mental eye  Too cold our most transporting Zeal  To paint what Heav'ns light conceal  Yet will the skeptick ask me why  Go rise to the dogstar fly  Thou canst not nor the cause unknown  Central  attraction  holds thee down  A pow'r occult which e'er thy birth  Fast bound thee to thy native Earth  From which thou ne'er canst hope to rise  To Lunar plains or solar skies  Nor less within it's sphere confin'd  The subtle essence of the mind  Tho' Heav'n has giv'n it pow'r to rove  In Freedom thro' the plains above  Hath wing'd it's active feet to run  With  Merc'ry  round the central sun  Has giv'n it distant Worlds t'explore  And seas of space without a shore  Yet still within Creation's round  Within our narrow system bound  Of what's above or what without  We harbour universal doubt  Say light prevails no contrast shade  Outlines the void we would pervade  If darkness reigns no chearing ray  Delineates blind  Enquiry's  way  Hence mortal man must ever be  Thy Author here unknown to thee  Destin'd thy erring way to trace  Thro'  Nature's  particolour'd space  Let  Ignorance  then her  Idol  dress  In  Justice Love Happiness  Adorn with  Mercy  's golden chain  With all the virtues grace it's train  And then adore in humble plight  And call those fopperies  infinite  The  pagan  thus despis'd as blind  Creates his Idol to his mind  Thinking his deity express'd  By  bird  or  beast  he likes the best  Then bows before it's painted shrine  And calls his wooden God divine  Cast the presumptuous thought aside  'Tis not  humility  but  pride  Unless that truly humble we  T'adore the God  Humanity  And such it is for whence arise  Our virtues but from moral ties  Whose known relations thus define  That  Essence  mortals call  divine  Lorenzo  ready for reply  Lay not thy prompt objection by  Thou sayst "thy friend himself deceives  "Nor God adores nor God beleives  "For tho' the mind the pow'r descries  "If left it's  By Essence is meant here those attributes or qualities by which we define any known  EXISTENCE  or distinguish it from any other  essence in the skies  "If none beleiv'd or none display'd  "To what is adoration paid  "In me no certain Faith is found  "My deity an empty sound  Not so for granting Iconfess  Thy attributes a God express  Ev'n thou'lt assert "still undefin'd  "The  perfect  by  th' imperfect  mind  But to thy attributes must join  Thy  infinite  or thy  divine  As  jugglers  who t'enhance deceit  To sacred science give their Cheat  While with the curtain still they hide  The  slight of hand  too closely eye'd  So here sly  theologues  impart  The  Hocus pocus  of their art  And hold  religion  's sacred veil  Where  slights of Understanding  fail  For know alass their wisest plan  Displays but a SUPERIOR MAN  Whom  Infinite  the Conjurer's rod  Presto  converts into a God  For till they solve our problem right  And tell us what is  infinite  They still must be reduc'd to own  Their  compound  deity unknown  To all or reasoning or inspir'd  This  infinite  a term requir'd  Differs  Lorenzo  then with me  In terms alone we disagree  Perfection infinite  is thine  Indefinite Perfection  mine  Condemn not then halfunderstood  I not deny that perfect  good  Allgracious merciful  and  wise  God reigns supreme beyond the skies  Neither 'tis true my terms imply  But granting none I none deny  Requiring but to acquiesce  That thou thy  infinite  express  Idly doth  Bolingbroke  refine  Granting that  wisdom  is divine  While full as idly he denies  Justice Goodness  to the skies  Ideas equally our own  Our  Goodness  as our  wisdom  's known  To both as hard to reconcile  Or Nature's frown or Nature's smile  Alass no attributes of thine  Can e'er the  deity  define  Impossible to judge or know  Of God above from Man below  Reserv'd the prospect of the skies  To gratifie immortal eyes  Lorenzo  let us reason right  No finite spans an infinite  Unless with  Matho  vers'd in Arts  We hold th' infinity of parts  But none th' absurdity will plan  That God can be contain'd in man  Tho' as absurdly they suppose  Our qualities the  God  disclose  Join'st thou with  Florio  the dispute  T'enhance each moral attribute  Pretending these however crude  Divine perfection doth include  As Species in a Genus they  Or parts which do the whole display  So with the grandeur all t'inspire  Of the gay mansion of his sire  An Idiot Heir his mother's fool  Taught his synecdoché at school  Conceiv'd by part the whole was shown  And took a sample of the  stone  Convinc'd doth  Polydore  with me  That  God's  indefinite agree  Yet argue that our partial view  May still be relatively  true  For if no abstract lights we gain  'Tis  just  our best to entertain  Our  God  to call that wond'rous  cause  In Nature trac'd by nature's laws  Mistake not here nor  God  dethrone  Be the first Cause in Nature known  'Tis but a consequent  Effect  Whose  Cause  no similars respect  The  God  we then by this define  Nor self existent nor divine  Be known Creation's various ties  Whence Physical relations rise  Explain'd distinct to mortal sense  The wond'rous scheme of  Providence  Say'st thou the Knowledge hence deriv'd  Of him those systems hath contriv'd  Alass from hence we only trace  The Features of Creation's face  The front it bears to humankind  But not it's selfexisting mind  Should we presuming to display  The spirit of the golden day  Thus call it's essence it's result  Attraction Fire alike occult  Or say 'tis Vegetation green  Who'd think it is the  Sun  we mean  So here t'absurdity we fall  Nor thus define a  God  at all  Yet while to thee I freely own  I reverence a God unknown  Think not through Ignorance or Pride  A God was ever yet denied  No  The word  ATHEIST  is here us'd to signifie simply one who denies the being of a God  Atheist e'er was known on Earth  'Till fiery Zealots gave him birth  For controversy's sake their trade  And damn'd the Heretic they made  Doth  Clody  impudent vain  Deny a God in skeptick strain  And yet in ignorance advance  That Natures works were made by  Chance  Warm  Theologues  absurdly wife  With their anathemas despise  For well may  Clody  these inflame  Whose  God  exists but in a  name  A technic term devis'd at School  I pity  Clody  as a Fool  To  Epicurus'  strains belong  The censures of an Idle song  For say "united worlds might join  "By accident not design  "  Atoms  might  luckily  contrive  "And  Strangely  find themselves  alive  "Or by some other scheme as wild  "The world be  Fortune's  fav'rite Child  Explain the terms say what is meant  By  atoms fortune accident  What mean'st thou but th'efficient cause  Of Nature's works Nature's laws  O think not then th'  eternal mind  To  term  or  epithet  confin'd  But take away or change the name  And  Clody  's God  mine  's the  same  Say'st thou in  Chance  a pow'r defin'd  Fortuitous absurd blind  Unworthy that stupendous plan  Which Nature's scenes display to man  Where grace with harmony allied  And wisdom strike on ev'ry side  Alass to  Clody  these unknown  For wond'rous  Wisdom  's all his own  In Nature nothing he surveys  That actuates his soul to praise  In vain the Planets run their course  Obedient to  Attraction  's force  Th'eccentric Comets far wide  Pursue the same unerring guide  In vain describes their varied race  In equal times an equal space  In vain thro' microscopic eyes  Innumerable wonders rise  On the green leaf whole nations crawl  And myriads perish in it's fall  Alass what bears the barren mind  What beauty can affect the blind  Should  Clody  then his  chance  disclaim  And own a  deity  by name  The blundering deist must advance  A  God  no wiser than his  Chance  How obvious is the truth yet  What learned volumes have been writ  How Scholiasts labour to confute  What none do actually dispute  Of the first cause or fools or wise  The pure  existence  none denies  But in it's  The word  ESSENCE  is here us'd in the sense above mention'd  page  essence  disagree  For who defines  infinity  Blush not  Lorenzo  then to own  Th'eternal God a God unknown  Whose face to mortal eye denied  Can never gratifie thy Pride  To him your votive altars raise  As  Athens  did in antient days  Nor dare pollute his sacred shrine  With human sacrifice divine  But humble adoration bring  And silent praise fit offering  So the  Peruvian  pure in heart  Strange to the guile or guilt of  art  Unaw'd by tenet text or tale  Erects his temple in the vale  Sacred to th'  universal mind  The God guide of Humankind  No firstlings here affront the skies  Nor clouds of smoking incense rise  No Hypocrite with acid face  No Convert tortur'd into grace  No solid skull in wisdom's cowl  No hooded hawk nor solemn owl  Nor blind nor ominous invade  This spotless consecrated shade  But as the native of the spray  Man hails his maker with the day  By Nature taught Heav'n asks no more  In  spirit  in  truth  t'adore  EPISTLE THE THIRD  to LORENZO  Nor to the fount of  Hippocrene  Nor groves of laurel ever green  Nor where the wanton Graces stray  With flowers is strew'd the muse's way  Lorenzo  no I more rejoice  At Reason's rough manly voice  Than at the sprightliest softest airs  That ever tickled  Fancy  's cars  Tho' senseless Echo found them sweet  And bade the  public voice  repeat  Lorenzo  systems throw'n aside  Be  Reason  then our honest guide  The guide not only to the mind  In Science deep or sense refin'd  But to the  plain  and  honest  giv'n  The first best artless gift of Heav'n  Reason  that sees not but the sense  Of  Ciceronian  Eloquence  The limits of our Reason known  To Heav'n resign it's honour'd throne  On humbler wings but rise to know  Thy  Heav'n  on Earth thy God below  Content to trace from Nature's laws  Th' effects of an abstracted cause  The Cause of all th' effects we see  The all we mean by  deity  Adapted thus  Enquiry's  plan  To truths as relative to Man  Know Nature's law no less extends  To  Physical  than  moral  ends  What moves the fix'd mechanic pow'r  To shed the soft refreshing show'r  That in the womb of teeming Earth  It's atoms quickens into birth  Doth in the moral scene connect  The cause consequent effect  Hence vice the source of human woe  As springs of streams that from them flow  On virtue happiness depends  As matter to the centre tends  Nor less capricious to the  sense  Physicks  indeed than  Providence  Conceive not then as skepticks dream  That nature's an imperfect scheme  Because perplex'd with grief pain  Man covets perfect bliss in vain  Say'st thou that  Man  the work of Heav'n  To him if  imperfection  's giv'n  Imperfect must that system be  Whose  Lord  a being weak as he  Lorenzo  let not words deceive  All  imperfection  's relative  For of  perfection absolute  All Nature is beyond dispute  For all from God itself derives  And all is perfect God contrives  Man surely perfect then  you'll cry  As Man most perfect I reply  The Creature of his maker's will  But form'd his pleasure to fulfill  Design'd in wide Creation's plan  To fill the place act as  Man  For doth capacity t'improve  Perfection positive remove  As well imperfect might'st thou say  The rising sun at dawn of day  Since with superior heat light  It blazes in meridian height  Form'd with progressive powers to rise  In  this  ev'n man's perfection lies  Perfect as such  humanity  Howe'er degraded in degree  Yet wilt thou say "is man consin'd  "To fill the place by Heav'n assign'd  "Impossible to rise or fall  "Why feels he misery at all  Another question answers this  What title have mankind to Bliss  Correct Ideas let us gain  Say what the misery of pain  In vain  Lorenzo  dost thou here  Affected  Stoicism  fear  None feels more tenderly than I  Mine the soft heart wat'ry eye  The sanguine hopes the needless fears  Yet unsubdued by sense or years  Yet Ah how little understood  Mankind's imaginary good  To Heav'n my grateful vows be paid  That Man in human Frailty made  That grief ignorance my lot  In joy Literature forgot  Or best remember'd in the taste  They give t'  improvement  's rich repast  No transport e'er had fir'd my breast  If born of Sciences possess'd  As when by native genius fir'd  To early knowledge I aspir'd  By slow degrees instructed grew  As Nature open'd to my view  To the weak eye as Hope was giv'n  Hope that directs the soul to Heav'n  Hence tho' no  Stoick  I conceive  All joy and pain comparative  The glow of Health the bliss of ease  Had never boasted charms to please  Nor cordial draught nor downy bed  Had e'er reviv'd the drooping head  Had sickness pale trembling grief  Ne'er wish'd for wearied eyes relief  See  Belmont  on the sofa laid  What racking Pains his limbs invade  Take half his  Gout  the respite giv'n  He calls a blissful taste of  Heav'n  Give but a Youth dispersing Wealth  Who riots on the bloom of Health  That  blissful part  which yet remains  And  his  were  Hell's distracting  pains  Pains which no aggravation know  And yet so relative our woe  Inflict them when by  Chloe's  kiss  The am'rous Youth dissolves in bliss  Ev'n these distracting pains were worse  A mortal's most embitter'd curse  In  By  mental sorrows  are here meant those reflexions or uneasy sensations which are vulgarly suppos'd sometimes to attend the perfect health of the body  mental sorrows thus our grief  Seeks but comparative releif  The trifling cares that  you  despise  To  some  momentous miseries  Ah me what threat'ning danger nigh  Why swells the tear from  Delia's  eye  Ah whence proceeds this sad distress  From th' insignificance of dress  Thus ev'n to  circumstance  we owe  The difference of bliss woe  Pleasure pain as light shade  By one the other still display'd  O what capricious joy strife  Attend the various scenes of Life  To wield the Scythe with sweaty brow  To turn the soil beneath the plough  To sow in hope reap in joy  Thine  Labour  is the sweet employ  Stranger to hope from want secure  Life's easy burthen to endure  To eat the grape nor prune the vine  Laborious  Idleness  is thine  Yet  Idleness  of Care complains  And  Labour  quarrels with it's  pains  How sunk terrible to  thee  The hollow eye of  Poverty  While  Villius  meets her with a smile  And sings or whistles all the while  Tho' worn his hands perplex'd his head  He relishes the sweets of bread  And many a time in pleasant rue  Dances for joy without a shoe  Nor less thy woes nor more thy joy  Since equal cares thy peace destroy  Since wanting ne'er thou ne'er hast tried  Th' effects of being satisfied  In Plenty little more enjoy'd  Than the dull bliss of being cloy'd  The child of Penury but  Ease  As of satiety  disease  Disease that takes our lives by Stealth  And makes a beggary of Wealth  When Fortune made thee rich gay  It gave th' anxiety for  play  Bade with thy  Hawk  thine  acres  fly  Thy  freehold  totter with the  die  Not greater care poor  Villius  knows  As Blest in  nothing he can lose  Thus Plenty giving bread more white  But steals the whet of Appetite  A Blessing plainly halfaccurst  That gives me wine but steals my thirst  Lorenzo  farther might we go  And prove still nearer bliss woe  To each inseparably join'd  Alternate regents in the mind  Yet so precarious in their reign  Bliss  tyrannizes into  pain  And when to cruel pain we bow  It's rod grows light we know not how  The tension of th' extended nerve  Say  Physiologists  may serve  This seeming paradox t'explain  Th'  affinity  of Joy pain  As strung the  Harp  with trembling Wire  With Nerves so strung the  human lyre  In healthful  concord  tun'd they say  Pleasures  harmonious Concert play  But if their tension more or less  From Passion sickness or distress  Most  tremblingly alive all o'er  The strings in  discord  charm no more  But jarring plays th' ungrateful strain  With harpysingers deaf'ning  Pain  Deduce we then  Lorenzo  hence  That joys pains are modes of sense  As tunes in musick where each note  The simple  Gamut  has by rote  And adventitiously combin'd  Please or displease but as they're  join'd  Should also passion sense or art  Wind up too high the nervous part  The tuneful notes in noise expire  Or breaking strings unman the Lyre  For as excess of Joy or Grief  Finds in a tear the  same  releif  The rapture of  Cleora's  kiss  Inflicts the  racking pain  of  bliss  Th' effect the same while both destroy  Exquisite pain extatic joy  Theme of continual dispute  No  relative  is  absolute  No Error such conceiv'd by Man  A blunder is in  Nature's  plan  Nor dare we impiously pretend  Ills absolute from  God  descend  The Question old unanswer'd lies  From whence did  moral evil  rise  Thou say'st if pow'r to stand was giv'n  Man had not fell the care of Heav'n  No tempter known to lead to vice  Serpent nor Eve in Paradise  Lorenzo  in the pride of sense  Instruction  is impertinence  She therefore daughter of the wife  Hath long been shelter'd in disguise  Ent'ring beneath the mask of Sport  The  presence  tho forbid the Court  So fond with young  delight  to stray  And moralize the wanton's play  That ev'n her precepts still prevail  In ev'ry sav'rite Gossip's tale  Yet so that those her arts would learn  May th' allegory's face discern  The moral then from Tales deduct  And let Philosophy instruct  Here the grand Error that we make  Morals for Physicals we take  Like those half mad amphibious wits  Who jumble in their learned fits  Effects causes each for either  God man Heav'n Earth all together  Fire spirit virtue mixture rare  With darkness  soluble  in  air  To  Hutchinsonian  Idiots leave  What none but Idiots can conceïve  Nor think thou  moral ill  exists  And battles in Creation's lists  A formal Enemy to man  Since Nature's monarchy began  A  Being  Physical or  Pow'r  Active poor mortals to devour  For 'tis impossible a cause  Should counteract Creation's Laws  As one or other must prevail  And one or both together fail  Beleive me then what  Ill  we call  Is no abstracted cause at all  For stript Creation of mankind  No  moral ill  were left behind  Owing to th' human breast it's rise  For man's first moral action  vice  Lorenzo  state the matter clear  Be pain pleasure strangers here  Strangers to pleasure to pain  Induce what motives to complain  For had we ne'er been griev'd or pain'd  Of  vice  we never had complain'd  Suppose we then in Nature's plan  T'exist the  microcosm  of  man  Asleep in senseless matter's arms  Which  perfect rest  nor grieves nor charms  Should Heav'n a conscious

pow'r to act  To censure or advise a fact  As by Experience nought it knew  Of  good  or  bad  or  false  or  true  For Reason it's conclusions draws  From similar effect cause  No instinct faculty or sense  That promptly dictates innocence  That bids us Virtue's steps pursue  Or points to bliss it never knew  For giving  reason  then had Heav'n  No less than actual  pleasure  giv'n  This not suppos'd hence Reason's use  Some known effect must introduce  Now if as  We admit of few  receiv'd principles  nor would this have been admitted so easily had it not been what those Philosophers who doubt of almost ev'ry thing else will readily agree to  innate  we maintain  A love of bliss hate of Pain  Directed as the passions fir'd  The  will  to  pleasure  first aspir'd  If  Pleasure  was the point attain'd  Of  Pain  an equal sense was gain'd  As the first  tree of Knowledge  bore  Of  good evil  equal store  For when the mind one pleasure knew  It's state of  perfect rest  withdrew  No  Neutral  sense it might retain  As  less than pleasure  now was  pain  Thus felt th'  initiated mind  The sting which pleasure left behind  And  Reason  did to  act  commence  On th' information of

Ourselves our Crimes alone offend  Is Heav'n's  premeditated woe  Heav'n needs no friend nor fears a foe  Has no vindictive rage in store  For it's own sake on man to pour  Blest in himself th'

The  will  would work continual woe  Reason bestow'd a common friend  Not to keep faultless but amend  To lead selflove a glutton blind  Which else nor hopes nor fears could bind  To give it's scene

Happy if saint or sage could tell  Where I with her might ever dwell  With thee bright  Truth  for whom alone  My Genius for the verse be known  Content for thee to change the bays  The  Poet's  for
