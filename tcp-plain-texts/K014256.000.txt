that clown said his business should be to collect from travellers  retires  Enter  FELIX  Felix  Yes here the postboy must pass if there is a letter for me in the bag he may for a little cash  give it me and keep secret so prevent Sullivan discovering my hidden precious resource A pity my nurse was from home when I call'd there yesterday she'll be distress'd and perhaps may write this very post enough to let any reader know the means by which I have relieved her  sees  Franklin Isn't that the facetious pedlar  Frank  Aside  He sees me  advances  tol lol lol  sings  then Heaven bless you my

communicative of his villainy  aside  Felix  I think he has a letter for me that I would not wish should fall into the postmaster's hands  Frank  Then it's only a letter for himself he wants out of it

boy would make me the happiest fellow in the world  half aside  Frank  If your mind is really good now for a severe trial  aside  exit unperceived  Felix  Shall I ask the boy or no upon consideration I'd better not he might refuse and I get vex'd perhaps he'd run into town complaining then Sullivan would have a handle for his ill will to me No if there's a letter I'll leave it to chance Eh I'm before Rosa's Cabin well thought on I am to be with her  horn  how sweet that sound this tranquil evening over the hills but harsh to the voice of love and Rosa  AIR FELIX  The horn shrill mellow loud and clear  May call to chace a fearful deer  How poor the hunter's pride  The trumpet puffs in boasting strain  To fight and o'er the verdant plain  Must flow a crimson tide  The postboy's horn hark music rare  Now skims the lake now fills the dell  Or sink or float upon the air  Or dying pant or nobly swell  His eager sports let death proclaim  To camp and forest round  The lover hears the voice of fame  When flutes melodious sound  At rural feasts the master's skill  The pipe can warble make at will  To join the dulcet voice  Blind minstrel sit in tuneful state  Thy harp oh sweetly modulate  You charm and we rejoice  The postboy's horn hark music rare  Now skims the lake now fills the dell  Or sink or float upon the air  Or dying pant or nobly swell  Horn harp pipe trumpet loud proclaim  Fight dance or song around  The lover hears the voice of fame  When flutes melodious sound  Reenter  FRANKLIN  Felix  Ha my merry honest fellow here again  Frank  Young man the money you generously
