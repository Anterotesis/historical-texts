 A Full and Just ACCOUNT OF THE Present State OF The Ottoman Empire In all its Branches WITH The Government and Policy Religion Customs and Way of Living of the  Turks  in General FAITHFULLY RELATED From a Serious OBSERVATION taken in many Years TRAVELS thro' those Countries  By  AARON HILL  Gent  Coelum non Animum mutant qui trans mare Currunt  Hor Epist L  LONDON  Printed for the Author and are to be Sold by  John Mayo  Stationer and Printer at the PrintingPress in  FleetStreet Anno Domini    ANNE R  WHEREAS our  Trusty  and  Welbeloved AARON HILL  Gent has Humbly Represented unto us that he has with great Care Labour and Expence Compil'd and Prepar'd for the Press a Book En∣tituled  The Present State of AETHIOPIA EGYPT the Three ARABIA's PALESTINE and the Whole OTTOMAN EM∣PIRE  and has therefore Humbly besought us to Grant him our Royal Pri∣viledge and License for the  Sole Printing  and  Publishing  thereof for the Term of  Fourteen Years  We being willing to give all due Encouragement to Works of this Nature tending to the  Improvement  of  Useful Knowledge  are Graciously Pleas'd to Condescend to his Request And we do therefore  by these Presents  Grant unto him  the said AARON HILL  his  Executors Administrators  and  Assigns OUR ROYAL LICENCE  for the  Sole  Printing and Publishing  the Present State of AETHIOPIA EGYPT the Three ARABIA's PALESTINE and the Whole OTTOMAN EMPIRE aforesaid  for the Term of  Fourteen Years from the Date hereof  strictly  Forbidding  all our Subjects within our Kingdoms and Do∣minions to  Reprint the same  either in the  like  or

portrait of Aaron Hill  M  r  AARON HILL Aetatis Suae A  o  Domi  H Hulsbergh Sculp  NE SOLUM FORTI P  OPRIUM  THE DEDICATION To The  QUEEN  MADAM  WERE it Possible for me to offer at your ROYAL FEET a Tribute so Important as to MERIT your MAJESTY'S Acceptance I had never paid my Debt of Duty in so poor a Manner But since the  Smile of HEAVEN upon the WIDOWS MITE Instructs us that the WILL not POWER must Enrich the Offering I am al∣most led to hope YOUR MAJESTY will Stoop to the Reception of so Low a Present when you shall be pleas'd to know 'tis all I have to give For LIFE and FORTUNE are so firmly Yours already that I cannot hope to tast the Length of one or Worth of t'other but by holding BOTH in Your MAJESTY'S Disposal  THE Sacred Power of PIOUS MAJESTY Commands not only Love and Loyalty from Subjects and Dependants but as the Attra∣ctive Virtue of the Wond'rous MAGNET draws the Sturdy IRON to its Sway may Challenge an Authority to Rule the Salvage Minds of Independant Infidels The Mighty Glories of your MAJESTY'S Successful Reign have bent more Kingdoms than You Govern to an Envy of the  BRITONS  Hap∣py in Your Influences And Experience Taught me that while  BRITAINS NAME  is NOW the Praise and Wonder of such Na∣tions as BEFORE scarce knew it The Pro∣digious Honour paid Her NAME is on∣ly owing to the Virtues of Her MO∣NARCH  TO whom then MIGHTY QUEEN shou'd I Address my Self for a Protection of my Labours but to the THRONE of MA∣JESTY where CRITIC'S Malice and the Sting of CENSURE cannot Reach me and where HEAVEN has seem'd to Point our Marks of Duty and Humility to lie as by the Seat of MERCY and the VICEROY of  OMNI∣POTENCE  BE therefore pleas'd Great Ruler of the HEARTS as well as PERSONS of Your People to accept this humble Offering which I lay with Duty at Your GRACIOUS FEET For as the small Improvement ma∣ny Years continued Travels thro' the Rougher Corners of the World have made me Consci∣ous of may so be Crown'd with the  Great Honour of YOUR NOTICE all my Future Aims and Utmost Applications shall be how to make my Self attain one Step a∣bove the Character which now I can with Honesty and Faithfulness lay hearty Claim to of  MADAM  YOƲR MAJESTY'S Most Dutiful but least Deserving Subject and Servant  AARON HILL  THE PREFACE  IT was an admirable Observation of Sir  ROGER L'ESTRANGE  That  a Book that Fac'd the World without a PREFACE shou'd be look'd upon as much Unfinish'd as a BEAU who comes to Court without a PERRIWIG  For it is not only grown a kind of  Law  by long continu'd  Custom  but is even become a  Necessary  Labour for the  Vindication  of a Man who  dares  assume the Name of  Author  from the  not alone Sharp Criticisms  but  Reflections  and  Scurrilities  he will be sure to meet with  WE Live it seems in a  Faultfinding Age  and 'tis almost become a  Crime  or  Argument of Soft∣ness  a Newfashion'd Word for  Folly  in a  Gen∣tleman  to Read a  Book  with any  other Aim  than to  Condemn  or  Censure  what he Ʋnderstands not  I'M sure I have just Reason to affirm a  Truth  I have been taught by the  Ingratitude  I wou'd not wil∣lingly  make use of a more Sharp  Expression  of some  CountryMen  of  mine  who by the  Baseness  of their  Tempers  and  Malicious Aims  of  Disappoin∣ted Envy  took I hope more Pains than Ʋsual to Con∣vince me that my  Native BRITAIN  cou'd produce as  Barbarous  and  Sordid Wretches  as I ever met with in my Conversation with the  Infidels  THE  Reasons  which induc'd me to Address the World with an Account of what I had observ'd in  Tra∣velling  so many Years together were not  Vanity Am∣bition Mercenary Hopes  or any of the  Common Motives  which urge Great Numbers on to Write  and build them up  to the  Fond Name  of  Author Heaven  indu'd me with a  Soul  too Honest to become a  Prostitute  to the  Poor Dross  of  Interest  Nor were my  Circumstances  such as might  reduce  me to a  Want  of those  Advantages  which have  too often  made a  Good Man Infamous  HENCE  Perhaps  I found so many  Enemies  for we are  now  Ʋnhappily Divided into such Disorder'd  Factions Open Discords  and Ʋnaccountable  ByInterests  that  Honesty it Self  is measur'd by  Opini∣on  and the  Scale  of  Merit  is  Outballanc'd  by  Par∣tiality  so that when a Man is recommended to the World  as worth Regard  The  first Examination  made a∣bout him is  Who sides he with  And a Report is given of his  Capacity  or  Principles  according to the  Party  he may Chance to  Vote  for  POSSIBLY I have been represented as a  Zealous Stickler  for some  Party  or  perhaps  been thought to  Side  with  None  as not too  fond  of  Either  which of these have made me  Enemies  I can't determine or if I have  Enemies at all  since it  may be  'tis the  Fashion  to Discourage VVriters for endeavouring to take more  Useful Pains  than  other People Be it one or t'other  I can only say I shou'd if any be exempt from  Prejudice  on that Account since I have been so little  Resident  in  England  that I never yet found time to  think  on  Par∣ties  any further than to wish there were no  Illdivided Ones  so much as dream't of in the  Kingdom  MY  Friends Perswasions  when I came from  Tra∣velling  engag'd me to comply with their Desires in  Pub∣lishing this Book  which I more readily Assented to be∣cause I knew I cou'd say somewhat more than had been  seen  or  told  the  World  by  Former Travellers  and I was naturally led to hope my  Youth  might plead a  Pardon  for my  Errors  since an  Author  who attempts to  Write  at  Four and Twenty  might I thought be readily Ex∣cus'd for  more Mistakes  than will  I hope  in the  Succeeding Sheets  disgust the  Reader  BƲT there are a sort of  People  who appear such  Zealous Devotees  to  Malice  that no  Reasonable Plea  is Proof against 'em  Innocence  it self is  spurn'd  by their  Presumption  and they are so  overfond  of  Warring  against  Common Sense Humanity  and  Goodness  that they generally  blind  their  Judg∣ments  to  indulge  their  Vices  and  Attack  the  Castle  where 'tis  ablest  to  Repulse them  THIS has been my  own GoodLuck  and the  IllFortune  of my  Censurers  whose  Weak Objecti∣ons  spread abroad for  Ends  I am about to mention were so  Innoffensively Ridiculous  as to  swell up  with  huge  and  threat'ning Venom  but  then burst like Toads  with their  Selfdangerous Poyson  Yet tho' they  hurt  not  me  their  Guilt  and  Baseness  is not less than if I had been made a  Sufferer  by their  Ground∣less Malice  For as the  Poet  has it  Who  hurts me not  is not the  Righteous Man  But  He  who  will not  hurt me when he  can  THE Society of  Booksellers  have in a manner quite  engross'd  the  Press  and the  Unhappy Circum∣stances  of some  Authors  having given them  Oppor∣tunities  to impose on their  Necessities  by Purchasing for almost Nothing their  Ingenious Labours  and by making all the  Gain  their  own Sole Property  In∣structed them like  Stingless Drones  to feed upon the  Honey  of  Industrious Bees  they made Advanta∣ges of  such Occasions  and  Encroach'd so far  by  gradual Advances  that they us  'd all Authors  as they did their  Poor Ones  and  assum'd  not only the  Prerogative  of  Purchasing  for  Inconsiderable Sums  the  Brightest Copies  but pretended to be  Judges  of the  Work it Self  when  probably  they knew not what it  Treated of  HENCE they were Encourag'd to Impose upon the  Town  by Printing  Old Books  with  New Titles  Selling Others at a  Double Rate  and  Authors  knowing they cou'd reap no  Profit  from the  Publication  of their  Writings  left 'em wholly to the  Bookseller's Direction  whence the  Press  was commonly  Corrected  and the  Book  ex∣pos'd to  Publick View  with as much  Nicety  and  Learning  as became a  Bookseller's Capacity  BY having Printed some  Few Little Essays of my own the Common way  I went as far as any  Line  cou'd reach towards  Fathoming  the  Consci∣ence  of a  Bookseller  or  Two  and  thence  became Acquainted with their  Customs  well enough to care as little as I cou'd for Dealing with them and unwilling to have This  Book  come out as  Un∣correct  as it might probably have done and see the  Town  impos'd on by too  High a Price  or let the  Book come out  too meanly Printed or on  Com∣mon Paper  I resolv'd to have it in my  Power  to  use the  Buyers  as I wou'd be us'd  my Self  and therefore at my own Charge undertook the  Printing it  but was advis'd that I might run as little Hazard of a Loss as Possible to do it by  Subscription  BƲT I was not  thus  deliver'd from the  Impo∣sition  of the  Booksellers  who pretended it  their Right  to have  Two Books Gratis  for  Six Sub∣scriptions  I refus'd to grant 'em this  Extravagant Demand  and gave 'em often  Publick Notice  of my  Resolution  whereupon they made it their Endeavour to  decry  the  Book  with  Open Malice  and discourage it as much as possible But lest their  Currlike Howlings  shou'd be  scorn'd alone  as  Insignificantly Noisy  they procur'd some  Little Pensioners  of theirs to Act the  Mastiff  and by  joining  in the  Consort bark  the  Base  to their  poor Trebles  THE  Justice  of the Thing was what they least regarded 'twas enough for them to say 'twas  Bad  Tho' being ask'd the  Cause  they cou'd reply no more than that  'Twas so because it was so Ar∣gument  was a  strange Plant  to their  thin Gar∣dens  But it must be held as an  Undoubted Maxim  That it wou'd be an  Unpardonable Crime  shou'd  they promote  an  Author's Un∣dertaking  who refuses to  promote  their  Lawless Interest  SOME have had the  Simple Honesty  to bring their  Money  to the  Printer  in a  Rage  and  Swear  they never had  Subscrib'd  but that their  Custo∣mers  oblig'd 'em to it owning freely that they did the  Book  the greatest  Injury  they cou'd because the  Author  had refus'd to give 'em  Two  in  Six  for No∣thing  WELL  Sirs  go on with your Endeavours I am above the  Reach  of your  Detraction Gain  I sought not and for other Matters let the  Book henceforward  speak  in its own  Vindication I am only griev'd for those  Unhappy Writing Gentle∣men  too much  Depress'd  by  Fortune  and  thence Subject  to your  Tyranny  I was grown so weary of the Mentioning the  Book∣sellers  that I had resolv'd to say no more about 'em when a certain  Humour  of a  Member  of that  Good Fraternity  who has the Sign of the  Green Dra∣gon  for Distinction made me laugh at the  Remem∣brance  and record him for an  admirable BargainMaker  HE had with much ado my Promise  by a Friends Entreaty  to allow him  Eight  as he desir'd with a  Proviso  he shou'd take 'em all  Unbound  But tho' he was  Solicitous  for nothing more before I granted it he  humm'd  a while with a  Wise Air of Con∣templation  when I sent him Word he might  Sub∣scribe so  and reply'd He thought that  Nine  'twixt Man and Man were very  Reasonable  Had I granted those he wou'd have  ask'd for Ten  and so encreas'd till I had found  if possible  the  Measure of his Conscience  MY Book lay  Open  at the  Printers  as it pass'd the  Press  for  free Perusal  and the  Booksellers  and their  Adherents  had thereby an Opportunity to  raise Objections  with  Pretence  of having read the  Sheets  but as I never heard  one Censure yet deserving Confutation  or indeed requiring more than  Com∣mon Sense  to Overthrow it so I thought it only fit to let 'em  Sink  without regard to their  Original Ob∣scurity  But if there shall be found a  Gentleman  who meets with any thing He  justly  may  Object a∣gainst  Let him be pleas'd to hint it in a  Letter  for me Directed to the  Printer's  House and then to Sa∣tisfie the  World  and him I shall not think my Time Illspent to Print it with as  large an Answer  as is  Necessary  in the  Preface  I shall  Publish  with the  next Edition  AND now I leave the  Booksellers  to their  Ad∣vantages  assuring them I owe them no  IllWill  and only say thus much to Justifie my  Book  against their  Calumnies  If  Profit  cou'd have brib'd my  Tongue  or Hopes of their  Good Character  have stifled my  Affection to PlainDealing  I had never been so  Open  in my  Declarations  of their  Artifices Ju∣stice  always  guides  my  Pen  nor can  Rewards De∣sire of Praise  or  Fear of any Man's IllWord  divert my  Course  of  Truth  from its  Direct  and  Un∣corrupted Channel  Contrary to the Assertion of the  Celebrated Juvenal  Jvu Sat    Tanto major Famae sitisest quam Ipsam  Virtutis Quis enim virtutem amplectitur  Praemia si tollas  So much  more Pow'rful  is the  Thirst of Fame  Than the  Neglected Virtue's  Honest Aim  For who  Courts Virtue  or can  long  Obey  When the  Rewards  She gives are  snatch'd away  I shall only add that as 'tis  evidently True  The Methods I have taken were as  Just  and  Honour∣able  as was possible The  Malice  which inclin'd these People to oppose 'em was a  Plain Effect  of some∣thing  in their Principles not altogether  reconcilable  to  Justice  For where  Honesty  Encounters  Hone∣sty  a  Sympathetic Harmony  is found between 'em and we have the  Words  of an  Experienc'd Greek  to teach us that  One GoodMan  never  Hates another  SOME  Snarlers  do and many more  may  Cavil at the  Style  I have made use of and the  Weigh∣tiest Arguments  they bring against it are that it appears  Affected  and  Elaborate  That 'tis Dress'd in a  Romantic Air  and that in  short  'tis so like  Poetry  that it runs into  Blank Verse Mea∣sure  and becomes a kind of  ProsePoetic  Composi∣tion  'TIS methinks  ungratefully  receiv'd if  Cen∣sur'd  on so  Weak  a  GroundWork  For I doubt not but the  Learned  Reader will perceive no greater  Difference  in the  Style  throughout the Book than where 'tis  purposely design'd  according to the  Va∣rious  Natures of the Subjects Treated on and a  Ju∣dicious Tast  will easily distinguish that the  Language flows  more  negligently  than it  Climbs Affectedly  in all the Treatise  BESIDES allowing I had taken Pains by an  Elaborate Bent of Application  to Compose a  Style  which I might be Deceiv'd in thinking  Good  'twou'd be but  Generous  and becoming the  Humani∣ty  of all who read it rather to excuse the  Real Er∣rors  than create  Imaginary Ones  because the  Fault  I had committed cou'd proceed from Nothing but an ardent Inclination to endeavour more than  Or∣dinary  the Satisfaction of the Reader  AS for its being Dress'd in a  Romantic Air  were that  Malicious Accusation  full as  Just  as 'tis  Absurd  I cannot see the Reasons why it shou'd be look'd upon as an  Objection  Every Body Knows the  Language  of  Romances  differs from  more Seri∣ous Writings  only in the  Fine Descriptions Flo∣rid Speeches Artful Turns  and  Winning Elo∣quence  which are made use of to  Adorn  and  Re∣commend  a  Feign'd Relation  and by Covering the  Flaws  occasion'd by its Want of  Truth  excite as  Noble Thoughts  and raise as  Emulative  an  E∣steem  of  Honour  in the  Reader's Soul  as if 'twere  Real  And if the abovenam'd  Ornaments  can Shine so Brightly in a  False Account  of  Things  and  Places  surely when they are  Additionally Streng∣then'd  by the  Truth  as well as  Novelty  of what they Treat of vpon  Second Thoughts  those  Self∣confounding Critics  who have Censur'd me on  this Account  will find  that what they aim'd  as an  Abuse  has prov'd a  Compliment  AND just as Weak an  Argument  is  that  which blames my  Language  as  Poetical  For I wou'd only ask  those Gentlemen  who  broke  their  Shins  by  Stumbling  upon  that Objection  What was the  Original Design  of  Poetry  and  if they know so much  they'll Answer me  'Twas Introduc'd  for  Pious Ends  and  Practis'd first  to  Win Man∣kind  from  Guilt  and  Follies  by  the Sweet Insi∣nuation  of  Harmonious Doctrine  for the Force of  Numbers  bears a kind of  Unresisted Charm  which having first  bewitch'd the Senses pene∣trates the Ear  and  Warbles Smoothly  thro' the  Soul  dissolving  Passion  in a  Flood  of  Plea∣sure  WELL then this  granted  me must  conse∣quently  speak it  undeniable That Poetry  is  Fittest  to Command  Attention  and it follows that the nearer  Prose  can  Imitate it  so much  more  'twill  tempt the Soul  to  listen to its Eloquence  and if that be all the  Ill  my  Style  is Guilty of I may pre∣sume the World will easily forgive me  EPITHETS are certainly  the Life  of an  Ex∣pression  and if using  them  a  little oft'ner  and more  Artfully  than commonly  we  do  will  not alone  adorn  our Language with a  Smoother Cadence  and  Com∣pleater Harmony  but add a  Sparkling  kind of  Vigour  to the  Style  they're us'd in why shou'd Men persist in an  Old Error  rather than submit to take  Example  from the  Practice  of  another  I know not any  Book  before my own that has been Writ  this way  and  consequently  cou  d not hope to  In∣troduce  a  Novelty  without encount'ring  Everarm'd IllNature  Even were my  Style  as free from Faults as I cou'd  Wish it  'twou'd have  Enemies  because 'tis  New  and how can any  Lower Aim that way  ex∣pect to Prosper  Unoppos'd  when even the  Glo∣rious Reformations  of our  Church  and  Go∣vernment  have many  Foes  who dare  Reproach 'em  AMONG the  Few  who I heard were Wise enough to think the  Arguments forenam'd  a Proof of their Capacities There is it seems a kind of  Talking Spark  who holds an  Office  in the  Ex∣chequer  very fond of  Raillery  He thinks that he has  Wit  enough to make  Atonement  for his Want of  Memory  or I shou'd take the Liberty to Blame him for forgetting he attempted  once  to make himself an  Author  But the  Itch  that  Juvenal  calls  Scri∣bendi Cacoethes  wanting Force to lift him higher than the Character of  Horace's Promissor Hiatu  he fell down like  Icarus  and Drown'd himself in  Infamy  thence losing all  Right of Pretence  to  Censure Others  by the  Miserable Insufficiency  of his  own  Labours  SATYR is a kind of dangerous  Edg'dTool  and like a  Razor  in a  Monkey's Paw  will  cut  the  Fingers  of a  Fool  who trys to use it  Wit  like  Fame  is very  Coy  and  Hates  a  Ravisher  She  Sports  and  Wantons  like the  Nimble Dolphin  in her  Native Channel  but like  Herrings Dies immediately  and  Stinks out  of her  own Element  THERE are a sort of People  to so Sil∣ly a Degree  the  Enemies  of their own Cha∣racter that  Silence  tho' the only  Skreen  to hide their Want of  Common Sense  is most a  Stran∣ger  to their  Daily Practice  These are to be  Pitied  and it wou'd be  Happy  since they are  Blind of Soul  cou'd there be found a  Mental Occulist  of Skill enough to  Couch the Cata∣taracts  of their  Obscur'd Capacities  that when their  Eyes  of  Reason  wou'd permit their  Judg∣ment  to see  Clearly  they might borrow a  Latin Dictionary  and try to  Construe  the  Two Ver∣ses  following  Juv Sat    Felicia tempora quae  Te  Moribus opponunt habeat jam  Roma  pudo∣rem  THAT I might  not alone Inform  but please my Reader I have taken care in the  Succeed∣ing Sheets  to Introduce as many  Stories  as I cou'd with  different Aims  for some are  Moral  some  Diverting  others  Melancholy  and of all  Kinds some  The only Fault which can be found with this is that it is  Digressive  from the  Subject  of my Book  'Tis true  and so are all the  Moral  and  Occasional Reflections  scatter'd up and down yet doubt I not but as the  Last  will be acceptable to  Honest People  on account of the  Good Doctrine  they contain and which I ever hope to bear in my Remembrance so the  First  will find a  Welcome  for the  Diver∣sion  they may give  Unprejudic'd Perusers  AS  some  may like my Book the better  others  will I question not  complain  that my  Quota∣tions  from the  Classic Authors  are too frequently Applied to  this  I need reply no more than that they  struck  my  Memory  as I was Writing and were  thence Transcrib'd  as they occurr'd by Ac∣cident Yet  this  I dare be pretty sure of that  there's none will Censure me for  the Respect  I bear  the Classics  in so  often mentioning their Thoughts  but such  Poor Wretches  as for  want of Tast  are made  Incapable  of  Prizing  or for  Want of Learning  cannot  Understand them  AS I have  little Reason  to believe my  Judge∣ment  any ways  Superlative  I will  not say  but I have Injur'd  them in the Translation  Where  the Lines  wou'd bear a  Literal Version  I have rend'red  the Expressions English Word for Word  but where I cou'd not come so near  the very Words without destroying  all  the Har∣mony  I  thought it better  to make Ʋse of  the Assistance  of a  Paraphrase  yet still preserv'd  En∣tire the Genuine Sense  of  the Original  A  Literal Translation  commonly appears  Con∣fin'd Uneasy Close  and  Aukward  like a  StreightLac'd Lady  in her  New Made Stays  but when  the Version  has put on an  Easy Para∣phrase  and the  Fine Lady  is compleatly  Dress'd  with  Ribbons Manteau  and her  Looser Or∣naments  tho' they are  still  the  same  they were before they brightly double  Former Graces  and become  Adorn'd  with an  Attractive Ma∣jesty  ONE  Sucking Critic  after having turn'd the Book over and over at the Printers with a Design to Practise the  Discerning Art  he had so lately taken on him fix'd at last upon this Translation of the fol∣lowing Line  Coelum non Animum mutant qui trans mare currunt  Men

PRETENDING to  Condemn  all Actions but  our own  is common  now  from even the  Cour∣tier  to the  Cottage  and  Deceit  is Dress'd in such an  Air  of  Honesty  they cannot often be distinguish'd from  Each Other Ignorance  Assisted by a  Grave Assu∣rance  passes currant for the  Depth  of  Learning Censure  is Esteem'd a Proof of  Judgment  and  Pre∣tended Merit  Elbows from her  Throne  the

Disguises  Impudence  Bullies  to  Peace  make  Counterfeit Pretence  And  Pious Carriage  hides the  Sinful Wretch  I hope I need not  Fear  that any Man will  Carp  at my attempting to  Translate at all  the  Authors  I have Quoted since the Book will  probably  be read by many who can only Ʋnderstand the  English  and the  Men of Letters  reading the  Original  may if they please pass over the  Translation  THE  Stretch  of  Malice  is so very wide that it has  Seiz'd  among my  Censurers  a  Pastor  of the  Church  of which tho' an  Unworthy  I'm an  Ho∣nest Member  and am therefore very  Sorry  that to Justifie my Self from the  Aspersions  of his  Tongue  I am oblig'd to do a thing so much against my  Nature  as expose the  Follies  I am loth to think 'em Worse of one who has the Honour to  Officiate  in the Cause of  Christ  and  thence  shou'd rather Merit the  Profound Respect  my Nature teaches me to bear the  Cloath I hope  he will not  long  be so  Unworthily Possess'd  of Men tho' never so  Religious  are not wholly free from  Mortal Frailties  He may  possibly Repent hereafter  tho' I see  as yet  but little Likelyhood of such an Alteration  I must own I was surpriz'd  beyond Expression  when after having  urg'd him  to forbear some  False  and  Scurrilous Reflections  on a  Dr  Gth  Gentleman  of  Worth  and  Learning  in a high Degree I saw him  Strike  his  Fist  upon the  Table  and cry out in  Passi∣on  before many  Witnesses Endeavour not to Justifie him he's a Vn Re and Rl and I'll run him down with all the Spite and Malice I am capable of uttering  And to do the  Lecturer Justice  he's as Capable of Both as any Man in  Christendom  I had not wonder'd to have heard this Speech from some  Robust  and  Brawny Grenadier  But when Mr  Dbns a Parson  utter'd it from whom I look'd for  better Doctrine  I was frighted at the  Em∣phasis  he put on his  Expression  and starting back∣wards with  uplifted Arms  cou'd scarce forbear repeat∣ing  Et Tu Brute  as the  Dying Caesar  did to his  Assassinate  NAY thought I if  you  who from a  Pulpit  e∣very Week Instruct the World can  thus  by your  Ex∣ample  contradict your  Precepts  you may

Injury  than I imagin'd and I thank his  Conscience  he has  try'd  to  keep his Word in this Particular  I had not mention'd him  in Reverence to his Gown  but that the  Credit  he obtains  thereby

Pretending to be  free  from  Malice  therefore I ow'd this  Justice  to my own Vindication for his  admirable Dissimulation  and  Set Airs  of  Gravity  are as  Persius  says  Persius Sat    Ad

Com∣plaint  to the more  Generous Call  of Humble Gratitude which tells me  loudly  that I cannot mention the  Advantages  I had of  other Travellers  without  Rememb'ring  and  Acknowledging  to  whom I  ow'd  them and declaring to my Reader that whate'er I  know  and far the  Worthiest Part  of what I saw was due to the  Unmerited  but  Boundless  Generosity of that  Glory  to his  Country The Right Honourable the LORD PAGET  many Years Residing at  Constantinople  as  Ambassador Ex∣traordinary  and so Wisely  Managing  that  Slippery Post  that he deserves  in all Respects  the Lofty  Character  he bears in  Turkey  of  The only Man who ever cou'd Preserve the Favour of the  Turks  and Interest of his Country both toge∣ther  I went Abroad  so very Young  that after having Sail  d a  Voyage  and made use of Accidental Opportuni∣ties to Visit  Egypt Palestine  and other  Eastern Parts  I came to  Constantinople  time enough to  owe  the  Best Improvements  of my  Education  to the Ge∣nerous Care of this  Wise Nobleman  whose  Instru∣ctions  and  Example  gave me  first  a Notion of the  World  and under whose  Protection  I was afterwards so Happy as to  see it to Advantage  having had the  Honour  to attend him from the  Turkish Court  to  England  in a Journey over  Land  thro' almost all the  Celebrated  Parts of  Christendom  THE Great  Discretion  Sure  Dispatch  and admirable  Policy  wherewith he manag'd the  Impor∣tant  Business  of his  Embassy  were such as won him so  Uncommon  a Respect from all the  Turkish Ministers of State  that under the  Extensive Um∣brage  of his  Interest  any Man who took upon him the  Protective  Name of  Englishman  was sure to meet in  every Part  of their  Dominions  more  Civilities  and  Toleration  than the  Christian Travellers  of any  other  Country whatsoever cou'd pretend to  hope for  HENCE a  Thousand  Marks of Favour were Conferr'd at several Times on many of  our Countrymen  and  hence  I snatch'd the  Lucky  Opportunity of  Seeing  with some other  English Travellers  in the Year  One Thousand Seven Hundred and Two  the Great  Seraglio  at  Con∣stantinople  so much  farther  than had been  before  permitted The  Grand Signior  being  then  at  A∣drianople  and his  Ladies  with him at his  Palace  in that  City  I have little now to add but that I  wish  with all my Heart the Reader cou'd be promis'd a sufficient Share of  Satisfaction  in the Perusing the succeeding  Sheets  to make  Atonement  for the  Tedious Time the Book  has been ex∣pected  Malice  is so very  Prevalent  and  every

Ex∣amples  of the  Greatest Men  who ever Publish'd Books  this way  BƲT as I seek not the  Applause  and very heartily despise the  Censures  of the  Snarling Ignorant  and  Ungenerous Vulgar  I Address my  Plea  to such a∣lone as  Learning  or a  Native Nobleness of Soul  has Qualify'd for  Serious  and  Impartial Judges  and those I dare presume to hope will easily perceive that if the  Book  has been a little  longer  than it was  Propos'd  in coming out it was no Fault of  mine  but owing to the  Common Slowness  of  Proceed∣ing  us'd in all  Books  Printed by  Subscrip∣tion

Author  but since I have made so  fair  an  Offer  of Obliging  all Objectors  with the utmost Satisfaction  Truth  can give them I wou'd willingly perswade my Self to hope that none will be so

P l for  Declaration  r  Declamation  The Present STATE OF  AETHIOPIA  c  CHAPTER I Of the Vast Extent of the  Turkish  Empire  The Cause of the  Turks  Success  THE  Turks  arriv'd at their amazing Grandeur from so obscure an Origin that the invaded World stood won∣dering at their Growing Fortunes while they shou'd have endeavour'd to repulse by a vigorous Opposition the bold Incursions of their encroaching Numbers And as at this Day they owe the quiet Possession of their former Acquisitions to the Supine Negligence and Civil Discords of the Christian World so the same Neglects and dissonant Interests and Affecti∣ons first built their Glory on the Entire Subversion of our Jarring An∣cestors But 'twill be needless to insert here any more of their History than will be found necessary for the more easy Comprehension of their present Condition  The Origin of the  Turks  WHETHER push'd on by Famine or expell'd by the prevailing Pow∣er of contending Neighbours is altogether uncertain A Body of Adven∣turous  Scythians  forsook their Country in the Year of  Christ  and inur'd to Hardships by the daily Prospects of Familiar Dangers pass'd o'er the  Caspian Mountains  and wrested forcibly the Possession of  ARMENIA MAJOR  from its surpriz'd Inhabitants From the Appellation of its Newcome Masters it receiv'd its present Name of  TƲRCOMANIA  who strengthen'd by the daily Accession of their Wand'ring Countrymen grew strongly planted in their Conquer'd Habitation and were soon af∣ter able to send Men under the Command of  Tangrolipix  the Chief of the  Selzuccians  a Family Eminent among them to the Assistance of  Mahomet  the  Persian Sultan  who by their prevailing Valour gave a happy turn to his declining Fortune But the  Babylonian Caliph  being Over∣thrown  Tangrolipix  offering to withdraw his Forces was detain'd unwil∣lingly by the Arbitrary Power of his ungrateful  Ally  This bred a warm Resentment in the  Turkish  Soldiers who retiring to a Wood increas'd  their Numbers by a daily Reception of deserting  Persians    Their Ad∣vancement to the Empires of  Persia  and  Babylon  till at last they Overthrew the  Sultan  in a bloody Battle and by the mutual Consent of both Armies  Tangrolipix  in place of the deceas'd  Mahomet  was declar'd  Sultan  of  Persia  and  Babylon  Stupendious Fortune favour'd the Attempts of his active Successors till the Glorious Expedition of the United Christi∣ans redeem'd the Conquer'd  Syria  from their Usurp'd Dominion  Their Ruin by the  Tartars  Vari∣ous was their future Fortune sometimes Gaining sometimes Losing till the Empire of  Tangrolipix  was wholly Subverted by an unexpected Inun∣dation of the Conquering  Tartars    They rise again  To whom the Flying  Turks  abandon'd the Possession of their enlarg'd Dominions and joining with their Coun∣tryMen of the  Selzuccian  Race in  Asia Minor  they follow'd the Fortunes of the Successful  Aladine  who Invading the neglected Corners of the  Graecian  Empire then Warring with the  Latines  Possess'd himself of  Cilicia  and the Neighbouring Countries Erecting at  Sebastia  the Arbitrary Throne of a Newwon Kingdom  Are entirely ruin'd in all Parts  BUT they enjoy'd not long a quiet Possession of their easy Conquests for the  arring Sons of  Aladine  dismembred their Dominion by a mutual Opposition to each others Interest till the fourth King from the Founder of that Monarchy became a Tributary Vassal to the Victorious  Tartar  who had now entirely broken their large Empire in the Greater  Asia  as the Successful  Mamalukes  had drove their CountryMen out of  Egypt  But the  Tartars  neglecting their numerous Acquisitions the remaining  Turks  seeing no Power to prevent their Wills divided with their Inter∣ests the dismembred Country And he that had Strength enough to take Possession enjoy'd the Government of whatever Part his Inclination led him to make Choice of  ERTOGRIEL  the Son of  Solyman  a Principal Member of the  Oguzian  Fa∣mily had with an unexpected Supply successfully Assisted  Sultan Ala∣dine  in a doubtful Battle and was Rewarded with the Possession of  Siguta  a  Bithynian  Lordship in which he settled his separated Family whose unstable Residence had till then oblig'd them to wander thro' the various Mazes of an uncertain Fortune And after a long and peaceable Possession having gain'd the Affection of  Christians  and  Turks  by his mild Disposition he dy'd in the Year of Christ and left behind him three Sons  Osman Saragutin  and  Iundas  The Rise and Antiquity of the  Ottoman  Empire  OSMAN  was Elected by the  Oguzians  to his Fathers Government who taking the opportunity of resenting some Outrages committed by the Neighb'ring  Greeks  Invaded their Dominions Overthrew their Armies in several Pitch'd Battles and having made himself Master of the City of  Nice  was after the Death of  Aladine  Elected to the Dignity of  Sultan  and reigning Years he wrested from the  Greeks Cappadocia Bithynia  and most of the Fortify'd Towns which border'd on the  Euxine  Sea till in the Year he chose  Neapolis  for his Regal Seat and from thence we date the Original of the present  Turkish  Empire  Then succes∣sive Conquests  OSMAN  was Succeeded by his Son  Ʋrchan  whose successful Attempts on the  Graecian  Provinces so much enlarg'd his Dominions that he fix'd his Seat of Empire at the Great City of  Prusa  which retain'd that Ho∣nour until  Mahomet  the First after several Acquisitions in the  European Greece  removed it to  Adrianople  The Successors of this Prince continued their Invasions on the remaining Branches of the  Graecian  Empire till by the unparallell'd Negligence of the State then disagreeing with their Em∣perour they lost their Ancient City  Constantinople  to the prevailing For∣ces of a Second  Mahomet  who by this additional Glory was justly Ho∣nour'd with the Title of  Great  the Loss of their  Metropolis  was fatally succeeded by an entire Subversion of their Shatter'd  Empire  Continuati∣on of their History  THE Successors of  Mahomet  by yearly Acquisitions enlarg'd their Territories in  Europe  and  Asia  which at last not contenting them the Victorious  Selym  extended his Dominion over  Syria  and  Egypt  bringing the  Arabians  under his Authority and raising the Foundation of a Larger Power on the bloody Ruin of the Subverted  Mamalukes  since when the latter  Sultans  have added to their Dominions most of the Islands in the  Aegean  Sea  Rhodes  with those Noble Knights who so vigorously De∣fended the Seat of their Order submitted at last to the Irresistible Power of the Successful  Solyman Cyprus  was oblig'd to fall before the Conquering Armies of the Second  Selym  and since then so prodigiously have they spread their Conquests that they now enjoy a free and unmolested Pos∣session of the Noblest Parts of  Asia Europe  and the Remoter  Africa  on which Extensive Foundation they have certainly built the most absolute Empire and Arbitrary Monarchy that has ever flourish'd since the Worlds Original  Extent of the  Turkish  Empire  FOR First the  Western  Part of its  European  Dominion is extended to the very Borders of the oncelost  Hungary  stretching to the  Adriatick  by the  Ragusean  Confines bounded on the  South  by the  Mediterranean  Sea on the  East  with  Pontus Propontis  and the  Aegean  even to the  Scythian Chersonesus    Poland  and  Russia  scarce bound its  Northern  Limits Within this vast Extent of Empire are contain'd the fertil Territories of the fam'd  Romania Ser∣via Rascia  and  Bulgaria Valachia  and  Moldavia  pay Tribute to its Pow∣er  Albania Epirus Macedonia Bosnia  and  Greece  are now entirely  Turkish  and the fruitful Islands of the  Aegean  Sea with those of  Candy Rhodes  and  Cyprus  acknowledge now no Lord but him  Their Em∣pire in  Asia  HIS  Asiatick  Territories contain that vast Tract of Land between the  Euxine Cilician  and  Aegean  Seas  viz Bithynia Pontus Phrygia Galatia Lycia Cappadocia Pamphylia Cilicia  and the vast Extent of  Armenia Mi∣nor  stretching  Northward  from  Colchis  to  Catai  and  Eastward  to the inac∣cessible Mountains of the Hardy  Georgians Armenia Major  is now mostly theirs  Babylonia Mesopotamia Phoenicia Coelosyria  and  Palestine  are al∣together in the  Turks  Possession as are the vast Dominions of the Three  Arabia's  Their Domi∣nions in  Afri∣ca  IN  Africa  it stretches along the unmeasur'd Coasts of the  Mediterranean  from the RedSea to the inmost Parts of the  Mauritanian  Country inclu∣ding  Tripoli Tunis Fez Algiers  and  Morocco  so vastly Large are the usurp'd Dominions of these encroaching Infidels But that the Reader may more plainly comprehend the  Whole  by a Measure of some  Parts  I have Calculated the following Account for his more particular Satis∣faction  PALƲS Moeotis  entirely his spreads full a Thousand Miles into the Land The Circuit of the  Euxine  or BlackSea contains at least Two Thou∣sand Six Hundred Miles Three Thousand Two Hundred Miles scarce compass  Egypt  and as much of the  Mediterranean  Coast as is subject to the  Turk  contains above Seven Thousand Miles in compass From the  Caspian Derbent  to  Aden  on the RedSea is Three Thousand and odd Miles and near Four Thousand Miles from  Tremessen  in  Barbary  to  Balsora  on the  Per∣sian Gulf  So that the amazing Conquests of the  Macedonian Alexander  are swallow'd at a Morsel by the swifter Acquisitions of a Modern Empire The stupendious Victories of the successful  Jews  outdone by these The mighty Power of the  Egyptian  Monarchs intirely baffled by the  Turkish  Soldiers The  Graecian  Empire once so famous for its Military Atchieve∣ments divided into Provinces by One far Greater  Athens Sparta Corinth Lacedaemonia  and those numerous Governments so fam'd for their aboun∣ding  Vertues are all involved in one Common Ruin and the Glorious Actions of their Prodigious Hero's forgotten and unimitated by the bro∣ken Spirits of their supine Posterity  The Conve∣niencies of their  Metropo∣lis  NOR wants this vast Dominion any thing that is requisite for the strenuous Support of its exalted Splendour its very Situation seems to speak it built upon the Loftiest Columns of  Ʋniversal Monarchy  for its e∣qual Division between  Europe  and  Asia  has plac'd it in the Center of the Surrounding World whereby they are ever ready to enlarge their Con∣quests either way and have fresh Supplies still near at hand to reinforce their broken Troops in every Corner while his Imperial City the Ancient  Constantinople  standing so Commodiously on the extreamest Limits of those joyning Regions is officiously attended by Two Neighb'ring Seas whose meeting Waters gliding by the Walls of the Magnificent  Seraglio  bring Wealth and Honour to this Potent Lord and lay the various Treasures of the Earth at the Worshipp'd Feet of their Illustrious  Monarch  The Titles of the  Turkish  Emperour  NOTHING can in a more lively manner express the Sense they have of their extended Power than that affected Vanity with which their haughty  Sultans  swell their Titles as  "King of Kings and Lord of Lords Ruler of the  East  and  West  and of all Parts of the World Prince of the Holy and Chast City  Jerusalem  Shining with the Brightness of God Thrice happy Lord of the Refulgent  Mecca  Tamer of Infidels and Scour∣ger of the Unbelieving Race of Christian Vassals Lord of the White and Black Seas The most Mighty and Invincible  Sultan  who has Power from God to Rule all People with a Bridle and to break open the Gates and Bars of all Cities and Strong Places into whose Almighty Hands are deliver'd all the Ends of the World none excepted"  These and many suchlike Titles are proudly Challeng'd by the Imperious  Ottomans  who in former Times have Blasphemously presum'd to take upon them the ve∣ry Attributes of the Almighty But of late they are become more Modest which may proceed from the numerous Disappointments that in the Mo∣dern Wars have so frequently baffled their presumptuous Armies and by curbing the Designs of their ambitious  Sultans  taught 'em better how to know themselves and prize their Neighbours yet notwithstanding the Inglorious Reigns of several Modern Emperors have added nothing to their Territories they still continue in a full Possession of their former Ac∣quisitions and are not only able to Defend  their own  but Conquer  other  Countries shou'd the Warlike Spirit of some more Active  Sultan  once lead 'em out to  Action  CHAP II Of the  Turkish  Policy  THE Political Maxims of an Arbitrary Government may not improperly be compar'd to the spreading Roots and twisting Fibres of some Tall Oak whose elevated Heigth exposing it to double Danger by the raging Force of Stormy Winds a∣mong its Branches has no Security but the Rooted Depth by which it is supported against the strongest Efforts of contending Tempests and certainly a Government so vastly Large so inexpressibly Rich and so strangely different from all other must be supported strongly by some uncommon Policy without which Guard the daring Ambition of aspiring Princes and the formidable violences of intestine Discords would like some surprizing Earthquake break fiercely thro' the Bands of Duty and by their factious Consequences involve the Empire in most inevitable Ruin  THAT I may with greater ease Describe the solid Foundations upon which the  Turks  have built their Safety 'twill be necessary to di∣vide their Maxims into Two Parts The First are those by which the  Sultan  supports securely his unrival'd Grandeur and the sure Dominion of his extensive Empire The Second are such Notions as are taught his Subjects with the earliest Rudiments of their common Knowledge and diffuse with ease a certain Awful Duty or almost Idolatrous Veneration thro' the whole Country for the Person of their Emperour and are the only causes of that mild Obedience and miserable Servitude with which they own themselves his Slaves and endeavour vigorously to exert an uncommon Industry in hopes to gain some Mark of Fa∣vour from the inestimable Bounty of their Common Master  The first Maxim of the  Turkish  Policy  I shall begin with the  Sultan  whose first Maxim of Policy is to Depo∣pulate as much as may be the remoter Parts of his wide Empire the more effectually to strengthen its Center  The Reasons upon which this Maxim is founded  The Reasons he gives to prove the Usefulness of this Maxim are these First That Countries far di∣stant from his Eye might with more ease and less danger be induc'd to some fatal Rebellion were the Number of their Inhabitants but any way proportionable to the Conveniency of their Situation Secondly By the miserable and barren Condition of a dispeopled Country 'twould be found a matter of inconceivable difficulty for an Invading Enemy to penetrate their Empire with a numerous Army since their Troops without the chargeable Inconvenience of vast quantities of Pro∣visions would never be able to subsist in a Country whose flying hand∣ful of Inhabitants would immediately convey what little Stores their Poverty afforded them to Woods and Mountains and Places inacces∣sible to People unacquainted with the Passes of the Country Another Reason is the utter impossibility which Discarded Favorites by this Means find to escape the Anger of their Offended  Sultan  for knowing no Place capable of Assisting or Concealing them unless they Re∣tire to some  Christian  Country they rather choose a voluntary Re∣signation of their Lives and Fortunes to the undisputed Will of their Great Master and quietly submit their Necks to the Sword of the Exe∣cutioner  BUT considering on the other side that the Strength and Glory of a Prince does chiefly consist in the Numbers of his People he is ever care∣ful not only to draw to the Center the Conquer'd Inhabitants of his dis∣p  opled Frontiers but by the subtle Bait of some inveigling Privi∣leges is constantly attracting innumerable Quantities of Tributary  Christians  to Embrace the Doctrine of their Fallacious Religion and by becoming Members of the  Mahometan  Faith enjoy the Possession of some little Marks of Distinction purposely deny'd to their more honest Fel∣lows who bravely prompted by the Dictates of their Vertue can with∣out concern despise those gaudy Trifles of a fansied Happiness and dare prefer the heavy Chains of honest Slavery to all the guilty Pleasures of an Apostates Liberty  Second Maxim  HIS Second Maxim is That the only way to preserve a Domestick Quiet is to employ the Heads and Hands of his Subjects in some Foreign War  Its Reasons  The numerous Advantages which accrue from this Maxim are so Conspicuous as scarce to need an Explanation for by this means he is continually enlarging the Bounds of his Dominions or at least improving the vast Numbers of his Soldiers in an Instructive Practice of all the va∣rious and necessary Points of Military Discipline By these means he pre∣serves himself secure from the sudden Violence of Domestick Rebellion for the search of Glory firing the Breasts of Officers and Soldiers they unanimously bend their utmost Endeavours to encrease the Power of their extended Empire which a lazy Peace might rather prompt them to Destroy For the working Brains of Men inur'd to War and Dan∣ger will abhor the Rust of idle Sloth and stir up gradually an Am∣bitious Fire in the Breast of the Soldier to lay a sudden hold on some inviting Opportunity and raise himself to Power and Honour upon the bloody Ruin of his surpriz'd Commander  Third Maxim  IN the Administration of his Justice he holds it a necessary Maxim that a tedious Legality is far more dangerous than a swift Injustice  Its Reasons  His Reasons for this are First The Fear and Awe which so rigid a manner of Proceeding infuses strongly into the Hearts of his Subjects making them ever ready to obey his most irrational Commands with an unexampled Willingness and terrifying their Reflections with so deep a Sense of his Power as to deter them from the smallest Inclination to a dangerous Disobedience and Secondly tho' some by so hasty a Severity may unjustly suffer yet Numbers are by their Examples fright∣ned from Villanous Actions whose Natures and Necessities would o∣therwise incline them to a constant Practice of the blackest Vices  Fourth Max∣im  ANOTHER Maxim teaches them That Learning is of all things the most dangerous to an Arbitrary Monarchy  Its Reasons  For First Was Knowledge encourag'd by the happy Advantages of a liberal Edu∣cation the Genius of their People would soon become much more re∣fin'd and consequently the gross Absurdities and fictitious Lessons of their  Alcoran  be look'd upon with Indignation when compar'd with the Brighter Doctrine of the Christian Religion They would soon discover the fallacious Dreams and vain Delusions of their fansied Paradise and throw off with their Ignorance the dull Stupidity of their slavish Ancestors they would soon perceive the Felicity of other Nations in a Glorious Liberty and casting off the Yoak they had so long submitted to attempt unanimously some wondrous Revolution and weary of a shameful Fate in their so long Subjection to a Tyrannical Govern∣ment redeem their Honour with their long lost Liberties and Tri∣umph in the Ruin of their Subverted  Sultan  Another Reason for this Maxim is a Notion commonly receiv'd in  Turky  that the Use of Letters  is altogether inconsistent with the rougher Genius of a Warlike Nation and that Learning if encourag'd would lull their Faculties in a silent love of Study till sinking in the soft indulgence of a Philosophical Solitude they would neglect entirely the more noble Practice of those Martial Exercises whose successful Application has bravely rais'd them to the glorious Em∣pire which now distinguishes them from the less Powerful World  Fifth Maxim  BUT above all these there is One Maxim the constant Care and Secu∣rity of the  Turkish Sultans  and that is to be serv'd by such Men as they can Raise without Envy and Destroy without Danger This they put in Practice by admitting none to the Honour or Trust of great Preferments but such as have been brought up under the strictest Discipline of a  Seraglio  Education They are generally the Sons of  Christian  Parents taken Cap∣tives by the wand'ring Incursions of the Roving  Tartar  and sent by way of the  Black Sea  to  Constantinople  as to a Common Market Out of great Numbers of these there are Yearly Chosen a certain Quantity for the  Grand Signior  's  Seraglio  where at their first Admission they are carefully In∣structed in the Rudiments of the  Turkish  Language and Religion Thence proceeding gradually as qualified in Body or Mind from the laborious Practices of the meanest Drudgeries to the loftiest Studies of their more Po∣lite Accomplishments till their Knowledge and Experience encreasing with their Years they are Preferr'd at last to some Place of  Honour  about the Person of their  Emperour  and thence advanc'd as Occasion offers to the Government of some Principality a Seat of Justice or Command in the Army whichsoever their Genius has chiefly seem'd to bend them to  Its Reasons  And by these Means being Educated from their Infancy with a ser∣vile Awe upon their Spirits their Endeavours are entirely bent to please their  Sultan  and starting from so severe a Discipline to the Seat of  Power  without Friend or Parent to assist them in their Enterprizes they have no possibility of attempting with the smallest likelihood of Success the least Design against the Interest of their  Sovereign  But besides this The  Grand Signior  has another Method no less Politick to prevent them from making an ill use of the Authority he trusts them with and that is the frequent Change of Officers often calling them from one  Government  to take  Pos∣session  of  another  in some far distant Part of the  Country  by which means having no time to fix an Interest with the People that are under them they are absolutely debarr'd from the smallest Hopes of Success in an At∣tempt against the  Person  or  Power  of their  Sultan  who seldom continues them so long as Three Years in one Place and as if in that time there was danger of a  Revolt  takes care by other Methods to render it still more impracticable for giving them no Money when he prefers them to a  Go∣vernment  and themselves Possessing nothing but what they receive from his Bounty they are oblig'd to borrow great Sums on Credit to furnish out their Equipage for which the  Christian  Merchants exacting often  Cent per Cent  Interest they have no other way to pay these Debts than by a bar∣barous Oppression of the  Provinces  they are sent to and knowing their time to be but short they seldom fail by Arbitrary Methods to enrich them∣selves for ever after by a Three Years Plunder of the poor Inhabitants by which means they become odious to the People who would be so far from assisting them against the  Sultan  as readily to embrace the smallest Oppor∣tunity for revenging their Misfortunes in the Death or Ruin of their Tyran∣nick Governour By which the  Grand Signior  's Power stands more unshaken than that of  Christian  Princes who have too often suffer'd by the Ambitious Inclinations of Rebellious Subjects  THESE are the most noted Maxims of the  Eastern  Policy whereby the  Turkish  Emperours maintain an uncontroul'd Authority over their so vast Dominions Others there are which being taught the People as Es∣sential  Points of Duty and Religion oblige them quietly to bend their Necks and calmly stoop to the galling Yoak of an Ignoble Slavery  Sixth Maxim  AND First Obedience to the  Sultan  's Will is taught them as a Duty the neglect whereof will draw down the Curses of God and  Mahomet  up∣on themselves and their Posterity His Word must ever be a settled Law and Infallibility a peculiar Perfection of his Nature None dare believe he errs and tho' his Actions appear altogether inconsistent with Reason or Humanity they must rather question the perspicuity of their Senses than presume to think he ever can be guilty Nay so widely has this crafty Lesson spread its Doctrine that to die by the Hand or Mandate of their Emperour is look'd upon by these deluded Wretches as a never failing Passport to the Gates of Paradise and so Sacred a Veneration do they pay to the Person of this Idoliz'd  Sultan  as if his People were destin'd as an in∣ferior Species of Mortality to serve the mighty End of his Creation The better to support this awful Sense of Fear and Duty the Expounders of their Law have fix'd a Notion in the Superstitious Breasts of the Common Peo∣ple that they can never pay too deep a Veneration to the Person of their Emperour since the good or evil Fate of the  Turkish  Empire depends entirely on the Preservation or Extinction of the  Ottoman  Family  Seventh Max∣im  ANOTHER Maxim among the  Turks  declares That Merit is the only valuable Nobility  Its Reasons  whereby the Meanest of their People exert their ut∣most Industry in the pursuit of Honour as knowing they must owe their Fortune to their own Personal Worth and not the Hereditary Possession of Lands and Tenements from the successful Labours of industrious Ancestors for the  Grand Signior  is the common Heir to all Mens Estates and distri∣buting some small Part among the Children leaves them to cut out their own way to Riches and Preferment and throws in the remainder amongst the numerous Heaps of his own prodigious Treasure  Eight Max∣im  ANOTHER Opinion not a little conducive to the  Turkish  Interest is That those who die in Battle against a  Christian  Enemy are immediately Transported into Paradise as a Reward for their Courage  Its Reasons  'Tis no great difficulty to guess the Effects of such a Notion on the thoughtless Crowd who are thereby at all times willing to Invade a  Christian  Country and hur∣ried forward to a zealous Madness by so encouraging a Doctrine fall rash∣ly on and prove too often fatal Instruments of Death and Vengeance  Ninth Maxim  THERE is another Maxim of their Policy which seems to have been owing to the vast Successes of their Arms in the Infancy of their Em∣pire and that is To look upon Prosperity as an infallible Sign of God's owning the Justice and Legality of their Endeavours  Its Reasons  By these Means they have encourag'd their Armies to a constant Assurance of repeated Successes from the favourable Consequences of one single Victory and drawn in pro∣digious Numbers of Voluntary Soldiers to the assistance of a Cause which such propitious Omens had induc'd them to believe must necessarily entitle them to the Smiles of Providence  Tenth Maxim  THERE is a Law amongst the  Turks  which I believe was introduc'd from an ancient Maxim of their Political Government strictly prohibiting all Subjects to the  Grand Signior  from Travelling for Improvement of their Knowledge and Experience into any Country not under his Authority especially such Parts of the World as are enlightned by the Heavenly Rays of  Christian  Doctrine and so very nicely is this Law observ'd amongst them that he who is accus'd of having broken it without a positive Order or Permission from the Court is often punish'd in an Exemplary manner and his Goods and Chattels forfeited thereby to whatsoever Use the  Sultan  shall assign them  Its Reasons  THE numerous Advantages arising to their Government from so strict a Prohibition of a Custom so diverting to the curious Inquisitions of our  Europaean  Gentlemen are so obvious to the Judgment of a Common Reader that they hardly need a farther Explanation since every Body must per∣ceive the chief Design of this so useful Maxim was to Cloak the Fallacies of their deceitful Doctrine from the hoodwink'd Eyes of its Professors whose clouded Apprehensions fatally Illuminated by a  Christian  Conversa∣tion might probably be brought to an entire Discovery of that inglorious Servitude in which they live and tempt their Courage to assume new Fire and redeem their Minds from an Erroneous Superstition while they brave∣ly chang'd the base Subjection of their Insulted Bodies for the generous En∣joyment of a Nobler Liberty And how far the continuance of this subtle Maxim may be serviceable to their Interest does beyond dispute appear in the good Effects it has hitherto produc'd and the frequent Insurrections and intestine Jarrs that almost Yearly happen on such of their Frontiers as by their nearness of Situation to the  Christian  Countries have render'd their Inhabitants no ways Strangers to the difference of their Government  MANY besides these are the Political Maxims of the  Turkish  Nation but I shall content my self with having nam'd the Chief and those on which they build the Pillars of their Constitution and will proceed in the next Chapter to give as full an Account as I can of the peculiar Form and artful Management of their  Civil Government  CHAP III Of the Civil Government of the  Turks  TIS Perhaps the most difficult Undertaking a Man can put himself upon to write of the numerous Intricacies of Foreign Govern∣ments and particularly One like that of  Turkey  the Native Haugh∣tiness of whose Insulting People and their coy Deportment to the Travelling Subjects of a  Christian  Country are so many inaccessible Barriers to the Curiosity of their Observations But 'tis a Task yet more difficult to endeavour a satisfactory Description of that Part of their Consti∣tution which composes this Chapter since the Offices of their Religion are so closely interwoven with those of their Law that 'tis almost impossible to treat of either without involving both in a promiscuous Confusion  HOWEVER that I may the more easily avoid the disagreeable Ob∣scurity of so unnecessary a Conjunction I shall gradually proceed to an Ac∣count of the Places of Trust and great Offices of their Empire as they now differ from or are dependant on each other  BY the foregoing Chapters the prodigious Power and unlimited Autho∣rity of the  Turkish Sultan  has been fully taught the Reader But tho' his Rule is Arbitrary and his Sway Despotick and Tyrannical he submits the Management of his Large Dominions to the depending Government of a deputed  Viceroy  and indeed it has ever been the Custom of the  Eastern  Emperors to Constitute some favour'd Subject in a Degree of Honour next themselves a Custom by many Authors condemn'd as owing its Instituti∣on to the slothful Disposition of some Inglorious Monarch wholly given up to Ease and Luxury  The Policy of Constituting a  Viceroy  a great Support of the Sultans Power  but in my Opinion founded on the subtle Maxims of a deeper Policy for by these means the Emperours may not only when they please unbend their Minds from the fatiguing Cares of an intangled Government but when the growing Anger of their injur'd Subjects provoke them to a Resentment of their oppressive Cruelties they throw the odium of their own Injustice upon their Guiltless  Viceroy  who skreening the Mis∣carriages of his Imprudent  Sultan  from the Revenge of a Rebellious Multi∣tude becomes himself the Object of their Hatred and lays the Foundati∣on of his Masters Safety on the Peaceful Consequences of his own Destructi∣on  The manner of Creating a  Grand Vizier  THIS Officer among the  Turks  is distinguish'd by the Title of  Vizier Azem  or Councellour in Chief to the  Grand Signior  from whom all Power is immediately deriv'd to him and by whom he is Created without any o∣ther Ceremony than the delivery of a large Golden Seal whereon is En∣grav'd the Name and Age of the then Reigning  Sultan  this Seal he always carries in his Bosom and becomes thereby Invested with an Authority al∣most as Arbitrary and Unlimited as that of the Emperour himself  The Antiqui∣ty of this Office  AMƲRATH  the Third was the Institutor of this Office at a time when breaking into  Europe  he conferr'd the Dignity of General and Chief Councellour on one  Lala Schabin  his Tutor since which time his Successors have continued to appoint some favour'd Subject to the Dignity of  Vizier Azem  and honour those Officers with the Name of Tutor as often as they hold Conversation with them  His Business and Authori∣ty  THE  Vizier Azem  as in Title so in Power is the Head and Mouth of the  Turkish  Law to him Appeals are brought from all their Courts of Judicature and by him the former Sentences of Inferiour Judges are frequent∣ly disannull'd and the Cause decided in favour of the Party who before had lost it There lies no Appeal beyond him unless to the Person of the  Grand Signior  and that so very difficult that 'tis very rarely put in Practice  The manner of Appealing to the Grand Signior  The manner of doing it is so odd and different from the  Europaean  Customs that the Reader will be inclin'd to pardon the Digression if I describe the Ceremony as briefly as is possible At certain Hours of the Day when the Gates of the  Seraglio  are set open for the Admittance of great Numbers of Citizens and Others whose Business with the Officers of that Place require their daily Attendance there the Persons who would complain of any grievous Injury they have suffer'd and which the Injustice or Connivance of the  Grand Vizier  has refus'd to redress enter hastily the Outward Court and putting Pots of Fire upon their Heads run swiftly forward nor dare the greatest Officer presume to stop them till they arrive in the Presence of the  Grand Signior  and humbling themselves at his Feet declare the weighty Wrongs they labour under and implore the gracious Mark of his unquesti∣on'd Justice in a kind Redress of their Oppressive Injuries  THERE is a private  Divan  or Court of Justice held in the Palace of the  Vizier Azem  every Wednesday and Thursday on the other Days ex∣cepting Friday which is the  Turkish  Sabbaoth the  Divan  is kept in an open Chamber of the  Seraglio  whither the  Vizier  is magnificently Attended by a great number of Pursuivants and Serjeants at his Arrival he is saluted with the noisy Acclamations of the People and guarded by a sort of Soldiers maintain'd purposely for that Use to his Place upon the Bench where be∣ing Seated with the  Cadeelescheer  or Lord Chief Justice and Six  Viziers  of the Ben  who are Grave Men that have formerly born Offices in the Govern∣ment  and are skill'd in the Knowledge of their Law but not permitted to give their Opinions on any Point unless demanded by him He listens to the Judgment of the Lord Chief Justice who hears and determines all Causes unless the  Vizier  shall disapprove his Sentence and Reverse it as he thinks is most agreeable to the Justice of the Cause or his own pri∣vate Inclinations  THUS much may serve as to the Judicative Power of the  Grand Vizier  but is far from expressing the utmost Limits of his Authority which ex∣tends its self so far beyond that of the other Great Officers of the Empire that tho' he cannot by virtue of his own immediate Order take off their Heads or recall them from their Governments he has so great an Interest in the  Grand Signior  that he can without the smallest Difficulty obtain his Warrant for the Displacing or Beheading any Officer at Court or else∣where who has unfortunately disoblig'd him or stands obnoxious to the danger of his Envy  IN time of War he has the Command in Chief of the  Sultan  's Armys and leads them where he pleases without the least necessity of waiting for his Master's Order He gives Audience to the Embassadors of Foreign Princes Receives and Answers the Contents of their Memorials and is in short the only Master of the Executive Power over the  Grand Signior  's whole Dominions  The Splendour of his Court  ANSWERABLE to the vast Authority of this great Officer is the pompous State in which he Lives his Court consisting frequently of Five and Twenty Hundred Servants including the Officers about him when he appears Abroad he is distinguish'd not only by the Splendour of his Equi∣page but the bearing on the fore part of his Turbant Two large Feathers set on with a great Knot of Diamonds and other Jewels of inestimable Va∣lue the peculiar Mark of his Degree the  Bashaws  being permitted to wear but One and the  Sultan  himself never appearing with more than Three Three Horsetails are carried before him on a lofty Staff another distinguishing Mark of his Authority Great Numbers of stately Horses adorn'd with Trappings of Gold and Silver set thick with Precious Stones are led before him his Stirrops held by the obsequious Hands of his sur∣rounding Slaves and his Garment kiss'd with the most profound Respect by endless Crowds of prostrate Officers whose servile Souls encline their Actions to the basest Practice of a vile Subjection to Men by Fortune plac'd above them while they basely Triumph over the miserable Wretches that are under their Command with all the haughty Marks of an insul∣ting Arrogance  His Revenues and Advanta∣ges  PRODIGIOUS and beyond Belief are the amazing Profits arising from this Post to the Coffers of its Possessor For tho' the Revenues of the  Grand Vizier  or his immediate Salary from the Crown does scarce exceed Five Thousand Pounds  per annum  'tis yet impossible to guess the vast Ad∣vantages it brings him for besides the great Sums of Money he receives from the Numbers of his Petitioners who be their Business of what nature it will dare never move it empty Handed there are daily Rivolets of Plenty from all Parts of the Empire flowing to his Treasury No Subject to the  Grand Signior  dares enter on a Place of Power till by the moving Rhetorick of some considerable Present he has brib'd the Favour of the  Grand Vizier  without which he is always sensible his Head will surely pay the Forfeit of his Avarice There are certain times of the Year when all the Governours of Provinces are oblig'd to send Presents to the  Sultan  after the manner of our  NewYearsGifts  and tho' there is no Obligation which compels them at that time to remember the  Vizier  a fatal Experi∣ence  of the Consequences of such a Neglect has often convinc'd them that tis highly Dangerous to forget him The Rulers of the Remotest Branches of the  Turkish  Empire are Oblig'd to Court his Favourable Re∣presentation of their services with the Perswasive Oratory of their Golden Messengers and in short no Man who omits his Duty this way can reason∣ably hope a long Possession of his Honours or Preferments  BY these means a  Vizier  of a Covetous Disposition who loses no Advantage he may Reap from his Authority has such Incredible Oppor∣tunities of Encreasing his Wealth that many at the Death which generally Attends their short liv'd Splendor have been found Possessors of such Im∣mense Heaps of Treasure as have Equall'd if not exceeded that of the  Grand Signior  their Master But those very Riches which still render this High Office desireable in the Emulative Breasts of the  Turkish  Candidates are the very Poyson of its Pleasures and to a Genius blest with a se∣rious Contemplation on the Frailties of Humanity would open all the dangers of its Gawdy Glories and rather frighten him from their search than allure him to their Possession  The Office of  Vizier  a Dangerous Station  FOR few there are who long enjoy the Slippery Honours of this wish'd Preferment the  Sultan  's Policy forbids a long Permission of such un∣bounded Power and urges him to frequent changes of such dangerous Officers nor are there many who survive the loss of this High Post for having some time serv'd like a necessary Sponge to gather Riches for the  Sultan  's use he Squeezes them at last into his own vast Treasure and to free himself from all the fears of their Resentment invents some Plausible pretence to take them off and put others in their Place to grow up Gradually to the same Fate their Predecessors met with  IMMEDIATELY under the  Vizier  are these three Officers  viz  The  Muftee  the  RiesEffendie  and the  Tefterdar Bashaw  Of the first of these I shall take occasion to speak largely in the Chapter relating to the  Turkish  Religion as being  High Priest  and consequently not properly to be Treated of under this Head further than as he is concern'd in the In∣terpretation of their Civil Law and of that in its due Place  The Office of  RiesEffen∣die  The  RiesEffendie  is Secretary of State and in constant Attendance on the Person of the  Vizier  by whose Orders he dispatches Innumerable quantities of Patents Decrees Commissions and other Instruments over all Parts of the  Turkish  Empire  Its Profits  This Officer has Places of great Trust and Profit under him and by the Multiplicity of his Business Collects such Sums of Money to his own Possession as often Equal the Riches of the  Vizier  himself  The  Tefterdar    THE  Tefterdar Bashaw  is Lord Treasurer of the Publick Revenues he Pays the Salaries of all great Officers Depending on the  Sultan  by him the Souldiery is Weekly Paid and all Publick Disbursements made  His Profits and Danger  This is an Office of great Honour and Advantage but has the same Fate En∣tail'd on its Possessors with those abovenam'd and exposes them not only to the Danger of their  Emperour  's Hatred but often Sacrifices their Lives and Fortunes to the Fatal Malice and Inordinate Caprices of a Discon∣tented People  The  Muftee    I undertook to say as much of the  Muftee  in this Place as concern'd his business in the Management of their Laws  His Dignity  He is an Officer of great Authority Nominated to that Dignity by the  Sultan  's voice who ought to choose a Man of Exemplary Piety Untainted Virtues and Humility and more Especially of undoubted knowledge in the explanation of their Law His opinion in matters Civil and Criminal as well as in Affairs re∣lating  to the State is given by Subscribing Yes or No with the humble Addition of God knows better to a Paper in which the Question is for that purpose Stated and tho' he gives his Judgment in a Perswasive not Compulsive manner his Sentence is notwithstanding wholly Decisive and the Judges Verdict Regulated accordingly without the tedious Trouble of a further Appeal or any Dilatory Practice whatsoever for the Reli∣gion of the  Turks  having Plac'd in this Man a Perspicuity of Judgment al∣most equal to the Peremptory Doctrine of a Roman Infallibility no Sub∣ject dares dispute the  Muftee  's Wisdom nor will the Emperour himself contemn his Counsel for he seldom undertakes a distant War or any o∣ther Business of Weighty Moment till the Approbation of this Religious Man has Sanctified the Action When Matters of Difficulty are Debated before the  Sultan  the  Muftee  is always Present at the Council and his ad∣vice requir'd with the utmost Veneration  The Odd manner of Punishing them  but as his Honours are Superiour to most other Officers of the Empire so is his Punishment when his Demerits have requir'd it in an Exemplary manner more Surprizing for in a Castle at  Constantinople  which the  Turks  distinguish by the Name of the Seven Towers there is purposely expos'd a Brazen Mortar of un∣common Shape and Magnitude into which the  Muftee  when convicted of HighTreason or Unwarrantable Practices is Publickly thrown Head∣long and Pounded to Death with a Massy Iron Pestle  The Office of  Cadeelescheer  THE next Office below the  Muftee  is that of  Cadeelescheer  or their Lord Chief Justice  His Power  whose Authority tho' Originally confin'd to the Souldiery extends its self at present to the Determination of all sorts of Law Suits whatsoever with Submission to the Pleasure of such Superiour Powers to whom there lies an Appeal from the Tenour of his Sentence for the Military Body of the  Turkish  Nation enjoy this Privilege beyond the Civil that tho' themselves are Subject to none besides their own Com∣manders the Authority of their Officers extends Promiscuously over all sorts of People insomuch that all Commission'd Officers of the  Turkish  Army are by Virtue of the Commission they possess Entituled to the Office of Justices of the Peace over all parts of the Empire a Policy not a little Advantagious to the  Grand Signior  by the vast En∣couragement it gives the Souldiers who ever were and must be still the Pillars of his Government this Office of  Cadeelescheer  is a step from which they often Mount to that of  Muftee  nor can any Man be Legally Enti∣tuled to the one who has not first Discharged with Universal Praise the Duty of the other  The  Mollah  THEY generally rise to the Preferment of  Cadeelescheer  from the Office of a  Mollah  the Advantages of which Post are different according to the Places over which they Exercise their Power some are Judges in Chief over whole Provinces and have under their Command the  Kaddees  or Judges of Stately Towns and Villages others there are whose Go∣vernment is Confin'd to Poor and Inconsiderable Places having under them the Tatter'd Judges of a few Distrest and Miserable Cottages  The  Kaddee  THE next Inferiour Officer is the  Kaddee  abovemention'd or the Lowest sort of Judges among the  Turks  the Profits arising from this Post are more or less according to the Places under their Jurisdicti∣on but is Considerable as being the First Step towards obtaining the Dignity of  Muftee  a Preferment Eagerly desir'd by the Politest of their People  THUS much may have serv'd to give the Judicious Reader a Sufficient Idea of the Fountain of Civil Government now Exercis'd in the Court of  Turkey  whence slow Innumerable Streams of Policy  to the Channels of remoter Governments possess'd in their several De∣grees by  Beylerbeys Sangiack Beys Bashaws Beys  and  Aga's  every one of which Offices I shall largely Treat of in their respective Places  The division of their Em∣pire  THE Formidable Empire of these Successful Infidels is divided into Twenty Two Parts each Division of so vast Extent as exceeds the Mag∣nitude of many of our  Europaean  Kingdoms and govern'd by its  Beylerbey  or ArchDuke for of all  Christian  Titles there is none which can more nearly express the nature of that Office every one of these ArchDuke∣doms is divided into certain unequal Numbers of  Sangiacks  or Provinces some containing Twenty some not more than Seven Ten or Fifteen according to which Numbers the ArchDukedoms are more or less Profi∣table to their Governours  The Sangiack Bey  over every Province there is plac'd a Ruler distinguish'd by the Title of  SangiackBey  or Lord Provincial These de∣pend upon and are subservient to the several ArchDukes under whom they live  The Bey  INFERIOR to the Lords Provincial are the  Beys  or Lords of the several Partitions into which the abovenam'd Provinces are divided  The Aga  These have under them another sort of Lords distinguish'd by the Name of  Aga's  or Captains of a certain Number of Towns or Villages and their Dependencies all which Officers have their several Courts of Justice pe∣culiar to the different Nature of the Governments they hold and yet are link'd together in the joint Promotion of one Common Interest and a firm Obedience to the Sacred Will of their Great Lord the  Sultan  The Bashaw  BESIDES these ArchDukedoms severally Subject to their respective  Beylerbeys  there are certain Parts of the Empire independant on those Divisions and altogether Subject to the Government of  Bashaws  a Title almost equal to that of Prince and generally born by such Men as having gradually Ascended from the meanest Offices have inur'd their Minds and Bodies to the roughest Changes that can befall Mortality and having prov'd their Knowledge by a successful Disintangling the occurring Intricacies of State and War distinguishably Shine by the conspicuity of their Me∣rits and Succeed alternately to the Highest Offices of their Unshaken Empire  BUT that I may explain more fully the unimagin'd Grandeur of the  Turkish  Emperors I will particularize the several Governments of all the  Beylerbeys  and the Number of those extensive Provinces over which they preside that by considering the numerous Opportunities the  Grand Signior  is Master of whereby to Reward the Fidelity of his Subjects the Reader may no longer wonder at the Support of his Authority  The ArchDukedoms of the  Turkish  Empire  THE Twenty Two ArchDukedoms before mention'd are distin∣guish'd among the  Turks  by the following Names  Anatolia Caramania Diarbekir Scham Siwas Esrum Pascha Childir Cheruzul Halep Marash Kibros Tripoly Terbozan Kars Musul Rika Rumeeli Kupudan Bosna GrandCairo  and  Babylon  of which the Governours of the Two Last receive their Salaries from the Treasury of the  Sultan    The Salaries of the Bashaws of  Cairo  and  Babylon  The First which is the Highest Government in the  Grand Signior  's Dominions has a Yearly Re∣venue of Three Hundred Thousand Pounds the Salary of the Last exceeds not Six Thousand Pounds  per annum  but the numerous Advantages which accrue from his Perquisites afford him daily Opportunities of amassing vast heaps of Riches  THE remaining Twenty have a certain Yearly Income appointed them out of the Annual Revenues due from their Provinces to the Coffers of the  Sultan  which tho' inconsiderable in it self is constantly multiplied into Fifteen or Twenty times its quantity by the griping Arts and avari∣tious Practices whereby these Arbitrary Governours oppress their People The fixed Allowances which they may justly Claim are these which follow  The respective Salaries of the ArchDukes of  Turkey           l  The  Beylerbey  of  Anatolia  has a Yearly Salary of       Caramania          Diarbekir          Scham          Siwas          Esrum          Pascha          Childir          Cheruzul          Halep          Marash          Kibros          Tripoly          Terbozan          Kars          Musul          Rika          Rumeeli          Kupudan          Bosna       THESE are the certain Salaries settled by the  Grand Signior  on the several  Beylerbeys  abovemention'd but as I hinted before are seldom the twentieth Part of the Profits into which they improve their Em∣ployments  THE Provinces contain'd in these Twenty Two ArchDukedoms are at least Two Hundred and Sixty Four every one of which as I said be∣fore has a Lord Provincial over it whose Profits may be computed about half as much as those of the  Beylerbeys  their Superiour Governours The  Beys  and  Aga  's possessing smaller Salaries in a just Proportion to the Infe∣riority of their Offices The  Bashaws  are all entitled to Revenues agree∣able to their Power and both the one and the other are alike un∣bounded  BY the prodigious Sums of Money amass'd this way which any Cu∣rious Reader may nearly compute by the Account abovemention'd and which in comparison with the  Sultan  's Revenues are as so many small Canals to the unfathom'd Ocean you may guess at the surprizing Gran∣deur and inexhausted Riches of the  Ottoman  Emperours which shall be particularly Treated of in a more proper Place I shall now proceed to inform the Reader in what manner the  Turks  Administer their Justice and how the Forms of Law are practis'd by that People  A Maxim of  Tacitus  'TWAS the Opinion of  Tacitus  that those Governments have most Laws who have least Policy and the strenuous Support which the  Turkish  Empire receives from few but necessary Maxims does in a great measure justifie the Truth of his Assertion for they have no confounding Volumes of one Lawyers Observations upon the Remarks of another no  COKE  upon  Littleton  to explain the different Interpretations of a Thing that is or ought to be the same The Reports of such a Judge or such a Lord Chancellour have here no Power to guide the Sentence of a Court of Justice by the prevailing Virtue of some forgotten Precedent  The speedy dispatch of  Turkish  Justice  Their Laws are few but always put in Execution with the utmost Severity and tho' the Sentence  Pro  or  Con  depends entirely upon the undisputed Will of an Arbitrary Judge whereby the Subject is depriv'd of that indulgent Liberty we tast in  Britain  and sometimes Sacrific'd to the mercenary In∣terest of a brib'd Decider he has yet this Happiness superiour to us that he always loses a Cause before the melancholy Consequences of a tedious Controversy has disabled him to support that Loss and depriving him of all possible means of a future Subsistance unfortunately sink both the Cause and the Client in promiscuous Ruin by one single Act of an unexpected Injustice  THE Truth of this will evidently appear by the speedy Dispatch of their decisive Sentence having no Form of Law but this which follows  Their Deeds and Instru∣ments  What∣ever Land Moneys Goods or any of the common Benefits of Life are bought by or given to a Subject of the  Grand Signior  's Dominions or any other Inhabitant of that Empire must be confirm'd to his Possession by virtue of a Seal'd Instrument call'd an  Hodget  which being Sign'd by the  Kaddee  or Judge of the Place they live in does certainly entitle them to as firm a Property as all the Deeds of Gift Releases and other endless heaps of Parchment now in use amongst us such an Instrument being once pro∣duc'd admits of no evasive Quirk to weaken its Authority no Word mis∣plac'd or Name mistaken by the adding or omitting some single Letter can baffle the Legality of a Subjects Endeavours by the Shock of a Nonsuit but where the Justice of a Cause is undeniably conspicuous they very rare∣ly suffer by a partial Sentence tho' where the Case is doubtful or obscure the native Avarice of a  Turkish  Judge will generally incline him to a favou∣rable Opinion of that Side from whence most Money challenges his Grati∣tude  Bribery com∣mon among them  nor is the Curse of Bribery esteem'd so black a Crime in this Coun∣try as in the  Western  World most Men practising it in a publick and au∣dacious Manner wheresoever their occurring Interests make it Usefull  Womens Oaths not taken  WOMENS Oaths are never taken but against a  Christian  nor a  Christians  against a  Turk  Among themselves the concurring Evidences of a plurality of Witnesses decide a Controversy Their Punishments are either Bodily or Pecuniary the first are rarely suffer'd when not deserv'd but the latter sometimes inflicted unjustly by the malicious Prosecution of re∣vengeful People or the partial Sentence of some poor and avaritious Ma∣gistrate  The Office of a Saubashaw  THERE is no City which has not its  Saubashaw  or Head Constable o∣ver it whose proper Business it is to inspect as secretly and as narrowly as possible the Behaviour of the Inhabitants having his inferiour Officers in e∣very Corner to detect the Misdemeanours of offending People and seizing their Persons deliver them over to such Punishments as upon Convicti∣on of their Guilt shall be judg'd agreeable to the nature of their Of∣fences  THE Corporeal Punishments in use among the  Turks  are different according to the several Crimes for which they are impos'd the most Common and that which is inflicted on Slaves Servants and the Practi∣cers of  Pettylarcenys  is the Bastinado or beating them on the Soles of the Feet The method of putting this in Execution is as follows  Their manner of Excecuting the Punish∣ment call'd Bastinado  FIVE or more Officers seizing the Offender by the Arms conduct him roughly to some smooth piece of Ground or Grassplat where throw∣ing him upon his Back the heaviest among them sitting down upon his Breast prevents him from springing upwards to avoid the Blows when two others by the help of a large Stick like the handle of a Broom bor'd thro' at both ends to receive a Rope there fastned by two Knotts and hanging down in a bent Form like that of a Bow lift his Legs from the Ground and rowling the Stick downwards as far as the Rope permits them prevent them from moving either one way or the other this done another with a stiff Hazel Wand gives him as many Strokes upon the naked Soles of his Feet as he was order'd to undergo which are some∣times several Hundred and have often prov'd Mortal to the guilty Party  A Comical Story of an  English  Mer∣chant  I cannot forbear the Crime of a small Digression to divert my Reader with the Comical Relation of a certain Passage which once in this Coun∣try afforded me the pleasure of a very agreeable Amusement There was an  English  Merchant who had for many Years been troubled with the  Gout  in a very violent and uncommon Degree nor could the daily Application of the richest Medicines procure him Ease much less the Cure he sought in vain for insomuch that being in a manner transported by the sharpness of his Pain he became so very peevish that he could neither talk walk or sit still in Comfort The pressure of this Gentleman's extraordinary Affairs requiring his presence at  Adrianople  he undertook the Journey with a great deal of uneasiness and met at the Entrance of a Town call'd  Baba  a considerable Party of  Turkish  Soldiers who were marching towards  Con∣stantinople  the Officer as is common in those Parts took the liberty as he pass'd to express himself a little disrespectfully in contempt of the  Chri∣stians  in the Merchant's Company and he unqualified at that time by the peevish Effects of his Distemper to bear it patiently made an ill Use of his Skill in the  Turkish  Language and return'd the Salutation as roughly as it was sent him The Inhabitants of that Country are of all others least able to bear Reflections on their Government or Religion and the Officer of these Men forgetting that himself had been the Aggressor resented the Affront so very highly that he order'd the Merchant to be taken from his Horse and undergo the Punishment of One Hundred and Fifty Basti∣nadoes in the manner above written Vain was Resistance against a Num∣ber so much Superiour and Complaints were altogether useless in a Country where the speedy Execution of an Arbitrary Order is the high∣est Qualification they believe themselves capable of In short the poor Merchant submitted aukwardly to the unwelcome Novelty and was so sorely beaten on the Soles of his Feet that for many Days he was oblig'd to continue in a House at  Baba  nor was he able to stand upright for a long time after but the Jest of this Story comes in the Conclusion for the Bastinadoes it seems having frightned away his Gout his Distemper went off with his Bruises nor was he ever troubled with the return of one single Fit from that time forward The unexpected Consequence of this lucky Beating oblig'd the Merchant at his return to  Constantinople  to seek industriously after the Author of his Cure that he might thank him for the Favour but not being able to find him out he contented himself with a grateful remembrance of the weighty Obligation and to this Day if he be still alive as constantly Drinks to the Health of his  Turkish  Doctor as he sits down to his Table  BUT to return to the Subject in hand they have several Punishments peculiar to the Military and other Orders which shall be describ'd here∣after in their proper Place One now in common Use amongst them is Impaling Alive that is thrusting in a sharp Pole at their Fundaments  Their man∣ner of Impal∣ing Alive  and Forcing it out at the Upper Parts of their Body and so Fast∣ning the Pole upright in the Ground they leave them in some High way as Miserable Examples to Deterr others from the like Practices  Other Pu∣nishments in use there  STRANGLING in a very Expeditious manner is the Death whereby they distinguish Suffering Noblemen Hanging they seldom use Breaking on the Wheel very Rarely but the most common way of Execution is Beheading the Condemn'd Person with a Broad  Scy∣metar  while he Kneels upon a large Heap of Sand to that end pro∣vided Other kinds of Punishments there are in  Turkey  but such as be∣ing very rarely put in Practice are altogether needless to be here mention'd and for that reason purposely omitted  CHAP IV Of the Government Military  IF the general Experience of the knowing World allows it as a necessary Maxim that every Effect of Nature and Morality must be Supported by those very Causes to which they owe their First Production it will follow Undeniably that a Government not Gra∣dually Rais'd from the continued Improvements of some unresisted Co∣lony but founded Violently upon the Bloody Ruin of a Conquer'd Peo∣ple must Slacken by Degrees that Nervous Strengh by which it Flou∣rish'd when the long neglects of Idle Peace Corrupt its Natives with the Love of Pleasure and draw them by Degrees to Hate the Practice of those Successful Arms by whose Unequall'd Force their Braver An∣cestors had Cut a Passage to Meridian Glory  The Effects of Peace of dangerous consequence to Warlike Governments  'TIS this alone to which the  Persian Graecian Roman  and every o∣ther Glorious  Monarchy  have ow'd their Downfal and 'tis the same In∣dulgence of a Slothful ease has Rusted all the Powerful Springs of  Turkish  Discipline and chear'd Exceedingly the Drooping Spirits of the  Eastern Christians  with Reviving hopes to see the Happy Resto∣ration of their Religion and their Liberty in the Entire Subversion of their Usurping Tyrant for that perswasive Poverty which once In∣clin'd the  Turkish  Souldiers to a Scorn of dangers has now no more the Power to Urge a Brave Defiance of the Shocks of War since they are all Possessors of a Rowling Plenty the want of which provok'd 'em Chiefly to their Ancient Actions  A great de∣cay in their Military Dis∣cipline  BUT tho' the present Managment of their Military Discipline falls greatly short of what in former Ages spoke them Matchless they are not yet so sensibly Decayed as to become an easy Conquest were the United Arms of Warlike Christendom now bent against them for tho' their Souldiers are not now Inur'd to War and Hardship nor by the Frequent Victorys they were us'd to gain familiar with the Face of Ruin and continual Contest they are not less in Num∣ber  than they were nor all so Ignorant as their Majority The  Turk∣ish  Policy permits no loss of Power by the loss of Souldiers and is perhaps the only Government that e'er grew Stonger by the Death of Subjects for having Numbers ready upon all Occasions to Supply the Room of such as Die their Places are Improv'd to double Worth by a surprizing Management peculiar to the  Turks  which shall be told the Reader in its proper Place They have no occasion on declaring War or losing Battles to dispatch their Officers for fresh  Recruits  about the Country and supply with raw unpollish'd  Rusticks  the Places of well disciplin'd and skilful Soldiers They have formidable standing Armies in every Corner of their Empire which from time to time supply the Vacancies of their  contending  Bodies which like the boundless Ocean tho' discharging endless Depths of Water appears no less in  Ebb  than  Flow  but stands the same in every Season never subject to perceptible  Di∣minution  IN describing the present Establishment of the  Ottoman  Forces I will begin with that Order of Foot Soldiers commonly known by the Name of  Janisaries  for the peculiar and remarkable Privileges whereby they are di∣stinguish'd from the ordinary Militia may justly intitle them to the Ho∣nour of a Preference  The derivati∣on and Ori∣ginal of the Word  Janisa∣ry  Janisary  is nothing but a Corruption of the Word  YaniCherr  which in the  Turkish  Language signifies a  NewOrder  they took their Original from the Death of one  Hodgy Bectash  an Old Religious Man of an  exemplary  Life and Conversation in the Reign of  Sultan Amu∣rath  the third King of the  Turks  This Man had long endeavour'd to dissuade  that  Prince from dangerously exposing his Person by too near a Familiarity with the Subjects of  Servia  often Prophesying the sudden Death which afterwards befel the  Sultan  upon the Overthrow of  Lazarus  the Despot of that Country when walking out to view the Heaps of Slain one  Miles Corbelitza  a  Christian  Soldier rising heavily from a Mount of Carkasses made shift to stagger in the Pangs of Death and by expressive Motions of his Head and Hands desir'd admittance to the Person of the Emperour who thinking he design'd to beg his Life permitted him to such a near Approach that the undaunted  Servian  falling on his Knees as if he would have sued for Mercy snatch'd out a Dagger from his  bleeding  Bosome and striking it with violence to the  Sultan  's Heart reveng'd successfully his Countries Wrongs and liv'd and dy'd like  Israel  's  Sampson  a double Scourge to an Ambitious Enemy  THE Death of  Bectash  immediately succeeded that of  Amurath  for having often prophesy'd the Blow and not preventing it tho' near the  Sultan  's Person he was cut in pieces by the furious Guards as a  Party  in the Treason but foreseeing easily what Fate would soon befall him he rent off a long Sleeve which he wore continually on his Right Arm and putting it upon the Head of one of the Soldiers cried out prophetically in the  Turkish  Language  Life from my Death shall like a Phoenix spring  To Guard from Dangers your Succeeding King  THIS said he Fell a bloody Victim to the Soldiers Anger but had his  Prophecy  compleatly verifi'd in the First Year of the next  Sultan  's Reign who reflecting seriously on the Fate of  Bectash  resolved to take some Me∣thod of  perpetuating  his Memory and Instituted a New Order of the Mili∣tia by the Name of  Janisaries  who to this Day in Imitation of the Sleeve which  Bectash  put upon the Soldiers Head are all obliged to wear a Head∣piece fac'd with pollish'd Steel to which is fastned a large piece of  Buff  that falling in a moderate Breadth from the Crown of their Head spreads gradually wider to the midle of their Backs  The ancient Care to sup∣ply the Em∣pire with  Ja∣nizaries  THE Institution of this famous and formidable Militia was Founded Originally on the surest Pillars of a deep but barbarous Policy for Officers were continually dispatch'd to make triennial Seisures of the  Christian  Children Inhabiting the Countries unhappily fallen under the galling Yoke of  Turkish  Slavery These miserable Wretches thus violently ra∣vish'd from their sorrowful Parents were distributed in Parties over all the Empire till they reach'd the Age of Sixteen Years at which time com∣pleatly versed in the Knowledge of the  Turkish  Language and Religion they were severally disposed of in the many  Seraglio's  belonging to the  Grand Signior  where for the space of Five or Seven Years they were in∣ur'd to Hardships by the laborious Practice of continual Drudgeries such as cleaving Wood bearing Burthens working in Gardens and every o∣ther toilsome Exercise till having learn'd the Art of Patience and sub∣missive Resignation to the Will of their Superiors they were instructed diligently in the Art of War and as the Death of other  Janizaries  afforded Vacancy succeeded gradually to their Posts and Privileges where Pra∣ctising with an emulative Courage the Dictates of their Education they give a fatal Proof how much the present Ties of Life exceed the Bands of weaker Nature for not retaining the minutest Notion of their Parents or their Country they bend entirely the Endeavours of their Arms for the wish'd Promotion of their  Sultan  's Interest and have in former Ages by the Excellence of their Discipline and Greatness of their Courage been Chief Supporters of the  Turkish  Glory and by the Just Rewards their Va∣lour won distinguish'd  Honourably  as the Flower of that Empire  The present neglect of that Order occasi∣on'd by their former Inso∣lence  BUT far below the ancient Spirit of this Martial Order is the grovel∣ling Genius of the Modern  Janizaries  who tasting largely of the Sweets of Power in the black Successes of their bold Resentments grew madly Inso∣lent and so familiar with Rebellion that having dy'd their Weapons in the guiltless Blood of many  Sultans  they became so terrible to succeeding Emperors that they have long endeavour'd by the subtle Force of undis∣cover'd Policies to Raise some Milder Order on the Ruin of the Former least like unhappy  Rome  's  Pretorian Cohorts  the rough Effects of their au∣dacious Violence should one Day Ruin that declining Empire whose Defence alone was the true Design of their Original Institution  Their Num∣ber and Pri∣vileges  THEIR Number was at first confin'd to Seven Thousand but is now improv'd to more than Forty Thousand  lawfully  Enroll'd besides vast Numbers who by the winning Virtue of an annual Present to the Officers of this Order become Possessors of those innumerable Privileges which exempt the  Janizaries  from Taxes Prosecutions or any other Ties of Ju∣stice so that being own'd on all Occasions by the Muster Masters of that Militia they stand secure above the Law and practice Villanies by the favourable Connivance of an uncontroul'd Authority  Their Way of Living  THERE are now One Hundred Sixty Two Chambers or large Buil∣dings call'd  Odaes  at  Constantinople  for the Lodging of the  Janizaries  but none in any other Part of the Empire because the  Sultan  's having ever look'd upon this Order as the Safety and Support of their Authority took care to have them always near their Persons a Design well laid but fatal in its Consequences Over every Chamber is an Officer appointed under the Title of  Oda Basham  or  Inspecter  of the Chamber The Creation of a  Janizary  is a peculiar Prerogative of this advantageous Office and the man∣ner wherein it is perform'd deserves Remark  The manner of their Cre∣ation  WHEN the Persons to be Chosen have gradually proceeded thro' the tedious Counse of their probationary Labours they are Summon'd  in their Places  to a Personal Appearance before the Muster Master of that Order  who having Registred their Names in Rolls of Parchment presents them Ceremoniously to the Inspecter of that Chamber into which they are to be admitted who making them pass  by  according to their Seniority the  Youn∣ger  holding up the  Elder  's Garment strikes every Man a Blow upon the Ear to remind him of the Duty and Subjection he then takes upon him and without the trouble of any additional Formality declares them  Ja∣nizaries  Their Pay  THEY receive their Pay proportionable to their Merit beginning with little more than a Penny a Day and encreasing their Allowances upon e∣very worthy Action till they reach the Salary of Seven Shillings  per  Week which is the utmost Pay a  Janizary  can pretend to till the  Seniority  of their Years or  peculiarity  of their Actions advances them to the Offices peculiar to their Order and makes their Riches equal to their Authority But by the way the Reader must observe this Pay is only an  additional  Encou∣ragement to excite their  Valour  for they have not only  daily  Meals provi∣ded in their Chambers with all the other Necessaries of Life but receive an annual Present of a Suit of Cloaths from the Bounty of their Emperour which is generally made of very good and serviceable  Green  or  Violet  colour'd Cloth the Form whereof may fully be perceived by turning to the Cut relating to the  Grecian  Wedding described at large in the One and Twen∣tieth Chapter of this Book  The Power and Interest of their Ge∣neral  THERE is an Officer appointed over this Militia distinguish'd by the Title of  YaniCherr Aga  or General of the  Janizaries  whose suspected Power alarms the Court with such preventive Jealousies that the  Sultan  takes a constant Care to give that Charge to one intirely in his Interest A Policy whose Effects have often sav'd the Modern Emperours from the threatned Violences of their fierce Rebellions The boundless Power of this Arbitrary Officer extends it self to the decision of every intervening Ac∣cident in favour  of  or judgment  against  them The common Punish∣ments of their less hainous Crimes are generally ordered by their Inferiour Officers and executed by the  Cooks  of their respective Chambers  The way of Executing a  Janizary  but if any of that Order is detected in a Guilt deserving Death he is condemned immediately by the Sentence of his General and thrown at Midnight with the greatest Secrecy imaginable with Weights about his Neck into the middle of the Sea  Their Arms abroad and at home  THEIR Arms in War are Scymetars and Musquets wherewith they Fight on Foot surrounding always the Person of their Emperour or in his Absence the  Vizier  or  General  they seldom Fight in other Order than the Figure which of old compos'd the  Macedonian Phalanx  When at Home they are appointed a the Guards of Honour to the  Christiam  Embassadors to keep perpetual Watch in all the Gates and Avenues of their Imperial  City  to Accompany and Protect such Strangers as are Curious to behold the Rarities of the Country from the barbarous Insolencies of the rude In∣habitants which they will do with all imaginable Courtesy and Fidelity for the small Reward of half a Crown a Day and sometimes les  They bear no other Arms at Home than a small Dagger call'd  Hanjarr  which with a large smooth Cane not much unlike the largest Staffs belonging to our Constables are known so commonly and so extreamly fear'd by all who meet them that no Man dares presume to offer the least Affront to any  Christian  guarded by a  Janizary  least his Blood should pay the Forfeit of his Insolence  A Story of a  Janizary  at  Constantinople  I remember with concern that at my first Arrival in that Country while I was a perfect Stranger to their Nature and their Language I was promp∣ted by the Curiosity of my Temper to walk about the Streets of  Constanti∣nople  and make my Observations on the Place and its Inhabitants under the undoubted Convoy of a faithful  Janizary  we were passing on a Caus∣way in a Publick Street when the Misfortune of a Rude and Ignorant Pot∣ter led him on to stop our Way by the means of an Ass that he had loaden with brittle Ware to Sell his Customers about the City The  Janizary  had already passed the Door of a large Shop from whence the poor Fellow drove his Ass upon the Causway and prevented me from following my Convoy there was a fair Descent not much beyond him whereby he might have gone down to the middle of the Street had he turn'd his Asses Head the other way but whether mov'd by a Religious Zeal which na∣turally teaches them to hate a  Christian  or by the Native Haughtiness of his unpollish'd Temper he press'd his Ass with fury forward and the Pas∣sage wanting breadth to give him room oblig'd me roughly to the incon∣venient trouble of an unwilling Squeeze to give him all the way I could but finding the unwelcome pressure of the Asses Panniers a little incomo∣dious I was forc'd to lay my Hands upon the Creature's Side and pushing forward somewhat violently and unexpectedly together both the Potter and his Panniers fell headlong from the Causway which was al∣most Five Foot high into the middle of the Street almost half a Foot deep in Mud and Water The Fellow somewhat hurt by the roughness of his Fall and very much enraged at the Destruction of his Glasses drew out a long Knife which he wore within his Girdle and running to the Causway endeavour'd furiously to reach my Legs with a revengeful Wound The  Janizary  who had heard the Fall and was come back to my Assistance leap'd swiftly down and drawing his  Hanjarr  in hasty Passion struck it to the Hilt in the poor Fellows Shoulder who falling on his Knees amidst the Dirt cry'd out with lifted Arms  O  God  and  Maho∣met  his only Prophet in what have I Offended to be made the Ʋictim of a Cur∣sed Infidel  Nay to so unreasonable a Degree was he transported by his Passion that finding no Redress he threw the Mud upon his Face and rowled himself about in Blood and Water while the  Janizary  march'd for∣ward unconcern'd and stately leading me untouch'd thro' Crowds of People who tho' their Eyes declar'd their Anger were oblig'd to hide their Thoughts in the deceitful Postures of a mild Neutrality  A dangerous Privilege of the Militia  AMONG the numerous Privileges peculiar to the  Janizaries  there is one a little inconsistent with the cautious Policy of the  Turkish  Government that is a Permission of increasing their Common Treasury by the successive Additions of what Sums of Money their  Aga  's or Generals die possessed of and the Grant of very considerable Profits arising from the Tenure of se∣veral large Tracts of Land in  Anatolia  How dangerous it is to Assign such Power and Riches to a Standing Army ever Quarter'd in the  Metropolis  of their Empire the  Turkish Sultans  have experienc'd dearly by the frequent Effects of that audacious Insolence which having long been nourished by the dictates of their Plenty has often Flesh'd the Lawless  Janzaries  in the Murder of their Sovereigns Nor do they only study their  Revenge  in the Success of their Rebellion since 'tis the never failing Interest of this Order to outlive the Reigns of many  Sultans    Their Abuses of an Inter∣regnum  for besides the sure Addition of a daily Penny to their former Pay they gain an uncontroul'd Authority to Rob and Plunder during the space of a small Interregnum violently Pos∣sessing as a lawful Prize whatever Goods they lay their Hands on and committing boldly black Outrages with the plausible Pretence of Griev∣ing out of measure for the mournful Death of their Indulgent Ma∣ster  THE melancholy Consequences of this Abuse of Power have as is be∣fore declar'd induc'd the Government to study Means of ruining this Order which not being able to accomplish by the dint of Force they have inven∣ted  many subtil Wiles to Weaken Gradually the Foundations of their Power for whereas the Matchless Discipline of Ancient  Janizaries  gave bright Examples to Inferiour Orders they are now admitted frequently without the Gradual Labours of Probationary Servitude Marriage once de∣ny'd 'em with the Strictest Prohibition is not only Suffer'd but En∣courag'd by their Officers Trades are follow'd and the Weekly Musters Slighted by Permission insomuch that their Unfurnish'd Chambers once the Nurseries of Successful Valour can furnish few at Wars great Summons who do not Artfully decline the Service by the prevailing Pleas of Wife and Family or some mean Shift whose common Practice has al∣ready Weaken'd and will in time Entirely Ruin the declining Columns of that Dwindling Order  The  Turkish Spahee  's  NEXT to the  Janizaries  I proceed to speak of that Order of the  Turkish Horse  commonly distinguish'd by the Name of  Spahee's  and di∣vided into two Bodys  viz  the  Europaean  and the  Asiatick  These  LightHorse Men  were in Ancient times the  Noblest  Cavalry the World could boast of  Rich  and  Formidable  by the Plenty they were Masters of never coming into the Field without the Stately Splendour of a Numerous and Magnificent Attendance and Shining Brightly over all the rest of their  Militia  by the vast advantages they made of their Acquaintance  with  or Interest  in  the Greatest Officers of the Empire  The Reasons of their late Decay  but Poisoning their Loy∣alty with the encrease of their Authority they Sacrifis'd their Honour to the Dictates of Ambition and Insolently Practic'd a continued Lesson of Mutiny and Rebellion 'till the common Fate of Falling Treachery Involv'd their Order in a general Ruin and from the Towring  Pyramids  of their Unrival'd Grandeur reduc'd them Gradually to a common Le∣vel with the Inferior Orders of the  Turks Militia  Their Pay and Opportunities of Encreasing it  AT present the Number of Spahees exceeds not Five and Thirty Thousand who Receive a Quarterly Payment in the Presence of the  Vizier Azem  a Custom Introduc'd by the Famous  Kupriuli  to prevent the Black effects of those Intestine Discords  common  Formerly from their Pay Day Quarrels The lowest Salary of a  Turkish Spahee  is at the Rate of one Shilling a Day to which they become Intituled to upon their first Pro∣motion to that Office and encrease their Pay by Gradual Steps such as the Favour of their Officers the Addition of Pence or Pence a Day for the Head of every Enemy they bring their General as much for the Infor∣mation of a  Spahee's  Death out of the Pay of the Deceas'd a Custom Poli∣tickly Instituted to prevent the Fashionable Cheats Impos'd on Christian Princes by their Military Officers Besides which casual Opportunities of Encreasing their Allowances they Receive the Additional Reward of Pence a Day upon the Accession of every New  Sultan  to the Throne of his Predecessors so that by the Favourable turns of Merit or good Fortune they go on Encreasing by Successive Additions till they attain at last their  Ne plus Ʋltra  and sit down contentedly in the full Possession of Eight Shil∣lings and FourPence  per  Day  Their Arms in War  THE Common Arms in use amongst these HorseMen are numerous and convenient and so strangely differing from one another that 'tis a Sight Compleatly curious to observe a Disciplin'd  Spahee  as fully Arm'd as War requires him For first a Glittering Helmet rather Graces than Defends their Heads a Back and Breast Piece Guard their Bodies and on their Shoulders Hangs a Bow with a Capacious Quiver of their Eastern Arrows their Girdles often hold HorseMens Pistols a long Light Mus∣ket Slung like ours hangs Neatly at their Sides and on their proper Thigh is Fast'ned a Large Weighty Scymetar werewith when Broken in upon Disorder'd Enemies they do Prodigious Execution and Riding  short in strong and spacious Stirrops lift themselves with ease beyond their Saddle and extend a Blow with double Fury Besides these Arms they bear upon the left side of their Horses beneath the Girt ano∣ther strong and broader BackSword which with an Iron headed Mace for that purpose fasten'd on the contrary side they use promiscu∣ously as they see Occasion  Their Disci∣pline rather desperate than regular  THEIR Discipline is mean and insignificant for they never Form their Bodies according to the politer Practice of the  Christian  Nations in∣to Regiments or Companies Rank File or any other Order but uniting strongly into one gross Multitude observe attentively the Nod of their Commanders and repeating loudly Exclamations upon God under the Expressions  Allah Allah  fall rashly on with speed and vigour and if re∣puls'd in their two first Endeavours to break the Order of their Enemies repeat with desperate Rashness their dangerous Attempt and if repell'd that fatal time forget their Courage and disperse confusedly in all the hurry of a shameful Flight  Their Punish∣ments  IN War the Charge of those Rich Waggons which contain the Mo∣ney for the Payment of the Troops is constantly committed to the Custo∣dy of the  Spahees  whose place it is to stand on Horseback as Centinels of Honour with a  Janizary  on Foot at the end of every Rope which supports the stately Pavilion of their  Sultan  or in his Absence the  Vizier  his Gene∣ral When their Crimes deserve the Punishment of Death they suffer pri∣vately like the  Janizaries  but when Demerits of a lower Nature call for Punishments of smaller Rigour they are bastinadoed on their Feet as is be∣fore describ'd while offending  Janizaries  feel the Cudgel on their fleshy But∣tocks that the one may Ride and t'other Walk without uneasiness by which means neither is prevented from the Service of his  Sultan  SO much shall serve to have spoken of the two extraordinary Orders of the  Turkish  Militia who receive immediate Salaries from the Treasures of the  Sultan  I shall now proceed to Calculate as nearly as is possible the prodigious Numbers of their Cavalry whose formidable Bodies have so often struck a panick Fear thro' the despairing Armies of con∣tending Governments  Zaims  and  Ti¦mariot    what  hey are  THE main Support and sinewy Foundation of their Military Power are the Orders distinguish'd in their Language by the Names of  Zaim  and  Timariot  the First of which in Rank and Title is no ways Inferiour to an Earl in  Christendom  the last may justly be compar'd with our  Euro∣paean  Barons and both not much unlike those Persons who in  En∣gland  possess'd Estates in  Capite  or the ancient Tenure of Knight's Ser∣vice  Their Use and Duty  IT ever was and still continues a Custom amongst the  Turks  immedi∣ately after having Conquer'd the Dominions of an Enemy to parcel out the Lands into certain large Divisions and bestow them instantly upon such of their Officers as had successfully distinguish'd themselves in the Reduction of that Country These Men in return for the Possession of their Lands are besides the necessary Duties of a Rustical Improvement oblig'd continually to maintain a settled Number of Men and Horses com∣pleatly Arm'd and ready at a Minutes warning for the Call of War to which they go themselves attended by their several Numbers when the  Grand Signior  or  Vizier  appear in Person in the Field but generally go or stay according to the Dictates of their various Inclinations when the Ar∣mies are Commanded by some Inferior General  The Charge incumbent on a  Zaim  OF these the  Zaims  as noblest in their Quality are richest in their Pos∣sessions and consequently Tax'd with a proportionable Weight of Care and Charges The lowest Charge incumbent on a  Zaim  is Four compleat and qualified Horsemen and the highest Nineteen The highest of a  Ti∣mariot  is Four and the smallest One But many of these Men ambitious of Preferment and desirous to be taken notice of for overacting their Parts of Loyalty and Obedience will often double sometimes treble their Proportion of the Soldiers  THAT the Reader may be able to compute the Number of the  Otto∣man  Forces I will proceed to make a reasonable Calculation of these Horsemen from the several Farms belonging to the Two and Twenty Provinces heretofore mention'd  In the Province of  Anatolia  are rekon'd    Zaims  and    Timariots     Caramania                  Diarbekir                  Scham                  Siwas                  Ezrum                  Pascha                  Marasch                  Cyprus                  Tripoly                  Rika                  Terbozan                  Halep                  Childir                  Kupudan                  Rumeeli                  Bosna                  Kars                  Musul                  Kibros                  Babylon               The Militia peculiar to  Grand Cairo  GRAND CAIRO  is omitted here as having a Militia peculiar to its self to be treated of hereafter consisting of Twenty Thousand Horse and Eighty Thousand Foot kept constantly to be ready upon all Occasi∣ons so that in the One and Twenty ArchDukedoms abovemention'd are contain'd at least Three Thousand Five Hundred and Four  Zaims  and Fifty One Thousand Five Hundred Seventy Nine  Timariots  and the Charges incumbent on the First of these being as I have said before from Four to Nineteen Men we may reasonably conclude that the Grandeur of One making full amends for the Deficiency of the Other they come at∣tended to the Field at the rate of Ten Followers to each Man which ad∣ded to their Masters compleat the Number of Thirty Eight Thousand Five Hundred and Eighty Men  A Calculati∣on of the Number of the  Turkish  Horse  THE lowest Quota of a  Turkish Timariot  as has been told already being One Man and the highest Four and indeed there remaining few of the Former since the vast Improvements made of ancient Farms we may with reason judge  Timariots  to bring one with another Three Men besides themselves to serve in War which make in all the Number of Two Hundred and Seven Thousand Three Hundred and Eight Fighting Men which added to the  Zaims Spahees  and  Egyptian  Soldiers aforemention'd compleat their Cavalry and form a Standing Army consisting of at least Three Hundred Thousand Eight Hundred and Eighty Eight accomplish'd Horsemen  NOR is this large Account of their Prodigious Numbers Swoln be∣yond the fix'd Reality of their Existence I might rather have ad∣vanc'd my Calculation in a High Degree from the Natural Dictates of Conspicuous Probability but shall Content my self with having given my Reader an Account Sincerely void of all Extravagancies and those Fashionable Practices whether  Justly  or  Ʋnjustly  I shall not here dispute so Unfortunately Imputed to the too Prolifick Fancy's of our Modern Travellers  The Order of the  Tukish  In∣fantry call'd  Azapi  PROPORTIONABLE to the Cavalry is the Unnumbred In∣fantry of the  Turkish  Nation which consists of several Degrees in Honour or advantage and all Maintain'd in War and Peace without the smallest Burthen on the  Sultan  's Treasury the most Unvalued Numerous and Unpolish'd Souldiers of the  Turkish  Army are the  Azapi  an Order void of Form or Discipline who in the Storming Towns defending Trenches or Attacking Armies are like useless Blocks of Timber Push'd upon their Ruin that falling Dead by Thousands they may as it were make Blunt the Weapons of the Enemy and with their Bodys fill a Ditch or form a Bul∣wark for the Passage or Defence of their more Valued Followers  BESIDES these General Bodies of the  Turks  Militia every Province has some Peculiar Order for its own Defence nor do the Guards of  Viceroys  and  Provincials  form an Inconsiderable Part of their Unshaken Strength and Power no  Bey Bashaw  or any distant Governour be∣lieving himself secure without the Guard of certain Thousands of Souldiers Appropriated to his Service who when the Common Danger or their Masters Loyalty speaks 'em necessary are sent to serve their Country where any Seat of War requires their Presence  THERE are besides these mention'd Orders several other sorts of Souldiery such as Gunners Armourers BaggageGuarders  c  of which in  Constantinople  only may be Reckon'd constantly the Number of or Thousand whereby the Reader may be able to guess what Propor∣tionable Swarms must be Distributed in all the Spreading Corners of that Spacious Empire  The  Turks  Auxiliary Forces from  Valachia  and  Moldavia  THE Subjects of  Moldavia  and  Valachia  are Oblig'd to send Auxiliary Forces to the Assistance of the  Turks  whensoever their occasions Press 'em to Require it the Settled  Quota  of each Country is about Eight Thousand Men Commanded always by their Respective Princes nor can the Weightiest Plea of Incapacited Poverty Exempt 'em from that Duty  The Duty of the  Tartar Han  in respect to the  GrandSig∣nior  's Service  BUT the Greatest aid the  Turks  Receive from their depending Allies is the fix'd Supply of Fifty Thousand Horse a Tribute due to the Occasions of the  Sultan  from the Petty  Tartar  to be led by the Young  Han  his Son or the Chief Minister of the Country when the  Turkish  Army is Commanded by the Grand  Vizier  or any other Ge∣neral but when the  Emperour  Commands in Person the  Tartar Han  or Prince himself must come and joyn him with a Furnish'd Army of an Hundred Thousand Men  HAVING Dwelt so long upon those Numerous Orders whose Unnum∣ber'd Multitudes Compose that Formidable Power whereunto in for∣mer Ages the Successfull  Turks  have ow'd their Fortune it may not be Esteem'd Unnecessary to describe particularly that Accomplish'd Discipline so strictly Practis'd in the Longest Marches of their Nu∣merous Army  THO' the  Turkish  Management of their Body Military has been Rendred void of Form and Discipline by the Mistaken Representations of some too Hasty Travellers yet a Person who observes with a Cu∣rious Impartiality the Artfull methods of their Warlike Government will soon percieve a Matchless Order Shine Conspicuously throughout their Camp whose Good effects Produce continually such Happy Con∣sequences as will more than make a full Atonment for their known Deficiency in the Art of War  The use of Wine denied Souldiers of the  Turkish  Army upon pain of Death  FOR First the use of Wine is there Deny'd 'em by so Strict a Prohibi∣tion that the Smallest Quantity when Discover'd is a certain Sacri∣fice of that Mans Life who has it in Possession Hereby those frequent Quarrels and Audacious Villanies so Fatal and Pernicious to the Chri∣stian Armies are Perpetually avoided and the Noisy Clamours of Tu∣multuous War Subservient Calmly to the Milder Influence of a Peace∣full Quietude no Rapes or Murders Plead for Justice to the Base Abettors of a Countenanc'd Disorder no Hopes or Prospect of Unlaw∣full gain can Tempt the Officers of a  Turkish  Army to the Loose Permission of Licentious Insolencies all is Mild and Serene and Silent and the Horrid Face of Gloomy War Disguis'd or Painted by the Brighter Marks of Form and Discipline  TIS for this the Officers of any Marching Troops throughout the  Turks  Dominions Dispatch continually from Place to Place a certain Number of the Trustiest  Janizaries  to Search the Towns through the which their Men must Pass and Seal or Stave what  Buts  of Wine or other Spirituous Liquor they find therein at Least Days before their Camp Arrives  A Curious sort of Torch∣es us'd in  Turk∣ey  ANOTHER Custom Prevalent amongst the  Turkish  Armies is to March 'em constantly from Town to Town and never suffer them in Peace or War to Lie so long in any Place as to Contrive such Mischiefs as our Christian Souldiers by their Tempting Opportunities do too often Study and find means to Execute nay so Carefull are their Chiefs to prevent Disturbances that they will rather Travel all Night long than give their Men the means of Plundering those Miserable Wretches on whom they Quarter and indeed it is a Sight Extreamly Pleasant to behold 'em Marching thro' the Thickest Gloom of Win∣ter Nights with so Innumerable a Quantity of Bright Illuminations as almost Rival Day it self with their Extended Lustre nor are these Lights like our small Torches but Compos'd of Large and Massy Balls of Flax and Cotton dip'd in Tarr or Turpentine or oftner a sort of Oily and Bituminous Wood which certain  Arabs  Purposely At∣tending on the  Turkish  Camp and there Distinguish'd by the Name of  Massalageelar  bear aloft in Iron Cages carried on a Tall and Eleva∣ted Staff not much unlike those Ancient Lights Describ'd in Old and Valuable Tapesttry  The form wherein the  Turkish  Gene∣rals Pitch their Camps  AND now since I have so often mentioned the  Turkish  Army 'twill no ways favour of a Disgressive Prolixity if I Describe at Large that Gracefull Order and  unthought  Magnificence wherewith they Pitch their Camps in every Place they come to First then the Large Pavilions of the  Sultan Grand Vizier  or any other General then Marching at their Head are Pitch'd directly in the midst of some Extensive Plain Surrounded at Submissive Distance by the Tents of his Lord Treasurer Chief Steward Secretary and the Master of the Ceremonies these Five Pavilions Plac'd as I have said before at a Respectfull Distance Extend themselves upon a vast Spot of Ground leaving in the Mid∣dle  one fine open  Square  in whose delineated Center stand a double Row of stately Pillars which support a lofty Canopy under which all Punish∣ments when order'd by the General are put in Execution Here come the Officers of the Army either led by Business or desire of Conversation and walking up and down in several Companies form agreeably a sort of  Pro∣menade  diverting tho' irregular  The  Turkish  Treasury how Guarded in the Camp  NOT far from hence are plac'd those valuable Chests which bear the Treasure for the Soldiers Payment pil'd in gradual Order one upon the other and rising in a Form directly circular These Chests are guarded both within and without by certain Chosen HorseMen who all Night long keep strict and formidable Watch with Spears and FireArms  THE Two abovemention'd Quarters are surrounded by the graceful Tents of the  Bashaws Beys Beylerbeys Sangiacks  and  Aga  's whose stately Form and vast Magnificence can never be imagin'd but by such whose ocular Demonstration have convinc'd 'em of their Grandeur for tho' the  Turks  delight but little in the outward Ornament of Houses nor aspire in the least to overdo each other in the  Europaean  Custom of Polite and Solid Architecture yet do they far more exceed us in the rich Ornaments and Contrivances of their Pavilions than we outshine their homely Hutts and miserable Cottages by the stupendious Fabricks of our finest Mar∣ble and the most lasting Statelyness of our most celebrated Edi∣fices  The wonder∣ful Conveni∣ences of the  Turkish  Pavili∣ons  'TIS every way impossible to describe at large those tripple Walls vast Rooms of State innumerable Apartments Kitchens Butteries Cel∣lars and convenient Offices wherein those Tents abound which form the Courts of some considerable Officers in their Army their Rooms are square and full of Windows neatly form'd to open always from the Windy Quarter and in short nothing either Useful or Ornamental is omit∣ted to compleat them  The Quarters of the  Zaims Timariots  c  BEHIND their Masters lie in measur'd Order a prodigious Number of the  Zaims Timariots  and  Beylerbeys  in Proportion to the  Sul∣tan  's Army who with their Horses Camels Mules and Carriages ap∣pear a huge and formidable Body of wellskill'd and disciplin'd Sol∣diers  Quarters of the  Janizaries  THe Chosen Glories of the  Turkish  Camp compose its Front consisting chiefly of the bravest  Janizaries  and such accomplish'd Voluntiers as ha∣ving fully qualified themselves by a long Experience for the Duty of an Office expect impatiently some profitable Employment by gradual Suc∣cession to the vacant Posts of such as fall or by the longwish'd Favour of some Great Commander These encompass at an aweful Distance the  YaniCherrAga  or General of the  Janizaries  whose Place and Power I have lately spoken of in the foregoing Part of this Chapter  The  Spahees  Quarter'd in the Rear  THE Rear of their Army is generally compos'd of the Politest  Spahees  who with many other Regular and Wellappointed Horsemen of the most Esteem'd and Honourable Orders maintain their Posts in case of need with wonderful Alacrity and Resolution making Good the Retreat of their dis∣order'd Fellows by bravely Sacrfising their Lives and Liberty for the preferable Interest of their  Sultan  and his Country  Station of the Baggage and heavy Artil∣lery  'TIS generally under the Guard of these abovenam'd Horsemen that the Baggage Camels and heavy Artillery belonging to the Army are safely Convoy'd and really when a Man who seriously reflects on  what he sees becomes a Witness of the numberless Attendants Trains and Carriages of the  Turkish  Armies he cannot but with Wonder bless that God who curbs in Mercy the Ambitious Arms of this prodigious Govern∣ment and has kindly plac'd a powerful Hook in the presumptuous Nostrils of their Great  Leviathan  THUS have I at large describ'd the fatal Instruments of those depo∣pulating Slaughters whose raging Violence in former Ages rais'd the Mo∣narchs of a ravish'd Empire to the loftiest Throne of undivided Power and arbitrary Tyranny which the World supports and still continue to main∣tain the Swords Prerogative whereby without respect to Justice or Religion the  Turkish Sultans  trample proudly on the softer Dictates of Nature and Morality removing violently whatever Rubs obstruct their Will and to whose Inhumane Practices nothing can be more applicable than the Precepts of  Photinus  express'd as follows in the Eighth Book of  Lu∣can  Sceptrorum vis tota perit si pendere justa  Incipit evertitque arces respectus honesti  Libertas Scelerum est  c  Scepters lose Pow'r when Kings Religious grow  And  valued  Honesty does Tow'rs o'erthrow  Free Villany Supports an  enviod  Reign  And  unsheath'd  Weapons  unshock'd  Pow'r Maintain  He who in Wicked Actions takes delight  Is Safe no longer than they Crown his Sight  The Pious Man in Courts shou'd never dwell  Vertue  and Sov'reign Pow'r agree not well  But he who meanly thinks such Sin a Shame  Let him for ever fear and miss the Road to Fame  CHAP V Of their Naval Force  The conveni∣ent Situation of  Constanti∣nople  in re∣spect to Na∣vigation  LET us now proceed to search a little into those extraordinary Conveniencies for attaining the highest Perfection in the Art of Navigation so peculiar to the Capital of the  Turkish  Empire that it seems as if the Hand of Providence had fix'd at  Constanti∣nople  the happy Seat of Universal Monarchy and blest its Neighbourhood with all the mighty Helps that bounteous  Nature  can afford a Country or the Hand of  Art  can possibly require to extend Dominion over all the World and spread Authority thro' distant Climates vainly separated by the Watry Desarts of a Stormy Ocean  NOT all the Kingdoms of the  Christian  World shou'd they resolve to join their Forces and partake promiscuously of one anothers Blessings cou'd afford conjointly more Materials for Maritime Improvements than  grow commodiously within the beckon of the  Turks  Metropolis  Timber whence brought them  for round the Shores whose ragged Cliffs encompass the  Euxine  or  Black Sea  stand endless Numbers of Tall Woods whose stately Timber fell'd for Use sup∣ply the City thro' the  Thracian Bosphorus  with the finest Wood requir'd for Building  Canvas Hemp Tar Pitch Tallow and Bisket  CANVAS for Sails and Hemp for Rigging well what Ships they build they have beyond all possible Necessity from those Parts of  Egypt  which surround  GrandCairo Valachia Moldavia Epirus  and  Albania  supply them plentifully with Tallow Pitch and Tarr the best in  Europe  as for Bisket it abounds incredibly thro' every Corner of their vast Dominions  The prodigi∣ous Magni∣tude of the Arsenal at  Constantinople  THEIR Ports and Arsenals for building Ships are Numerous and Convenient beyond Imagination that at  Constantinople  is so vastly Large and full of Volta's or Docks for Building as to be capable of Fitting out a∣bove One Hundred and Thirty Five Vessels at one and the same time nor are the other Arsenals and Harbours of his Empire less Convenient or Magnificently Splendid in proportion to the several Magnitudes of the respective Towns or Places where they are  Whence sup∣plied with Gally Slaves  and as for GallySlaves to tugg laboriously at the toilsom Oar they neither  do  nor  can  want fresh Supplies while the  Barbarian  Pirates or dreadful Ravages of the Inhumane  Tartars  present or sell them yearly Thousands of such un∣happy Wretches as have fallen unwarily into their Hands and so be∣come the wretched Victims of their insatiate Avarice  NOW may my Reader be induc'd to fansie from the Accounts above∣mention'd that the Relation I shall give him of the  Turkish  Fleets will be proportionable to their Conveniencies for encouraging above the  Chri∣stian  World the useful Art of Navigation but he will find his Error with a deep Surprize when he perceives their Naval Force not only un∣improv'd by an industrious Application to an equal Balance with the  Christian  Navies but on the contrary every way Inferior to the Maritime Improvements of those Poor Republicks whose small Extent and insigni∣ficant Possessions do scarce intitle them to the Name of Governments when look'd upon in Competition with the far superior Power of  Confe∣derated Christendom  Why the  Turks  grew weak in Navigation  YET is this great Misfortune rather owing to their  Ignorance  than  Idle∣ness  having frequently Attempted to Equip vast Navies and with some Success Invaded Hostile Nations with their sometime Formidable Squa∣drons but their want of Knowledge in the Arts of Building Rigging or the Management of Vessels still occasion'd Yearly Losses to the  Sultan  by their dreadful  Shipwracks  when they met with Tempests or more dreadful  Overthrows  when driven by the Turns of Chance to stand the Shock of a more Skillful Enemy in the destructive Trial of some decisive Battle  Gallies now chiefly us'd  'TIS for this alone they have of late disus'd their Large  Maahumes  or Ships of War and fallen wholly into building Gallies and Galleasses so that trusting rather to the Oar than their Strength or Courage they preserve their Navies from those shocking Dangers which so often broke 'em when they vainly thought themselves a Match by Sea as well as Land for  Christian  Enemies  THERE are notwithstanding now at  Constantinople  so many Tall and Stately Ships of War as might compose a Navy of Five or Six and Thirty Sail from Twenty Four to One Hundred and Sixteen Guns  but these are never sent Abroad for Use but Oftentation  The Form of  Turkish  Ships of War  They are beyond imagination high and broad their Sterns and Heads built high one Deck above another for Conveniency of Lodging Officers but so unweildy by their Form and so unfit for Stormy Weather by the Green unseason'd Tim∣ber which is us'd about 'em that tho' they put to Sea with Drums and Trumpets Sounding endless Crowds of Sailors Shouting and their Strea∣mers Flying with a rich Magnificence they soon return Unrigg'd and Shattered less in  Number  as in  Splendour  bearing shamefully the ragged Marks of Weakness and Disorder in their tatter'd Sails and Planks just ga∣ping to admit the Ocean  THE  Turkish  Gallies which as I said before are what they most de∣pend on are jointly subject to the same Misfortunes with their Larger Vessels and utterly unable to resist the Fury of a Winter Sea wherefore beingfix'd in dry Docks belonging to the Arsenal till the sharp extremity of that unfavour'd Season is a little over there are Orders given to the  Sultan  's  Admiral  distinguish'd by the Name of  CapitainBashaw  to call 'em from their Stations and with all imaginable Expedition put to Sea and Cruise all Summer  The manner of their rai∣sing Seamen  PROCLAMATION is immediately hereupon Issued carefully over all the  Turks  Dominions bordering on the Black and Midland Seas that such as hold their Lands in Tenour of Sea Service shall suddenly Re∣pair with their respective Quotas to their several Posts on Board their Gal∣lies this is done with utmost speed and generally brings together about Two Thirds of that great Number which their Fleet requires upon all Occasions  The Pay of a  Turkish  Sailor  TO fill the Vacancies which still require supply they List immediately prodigious Numbers of a sort of Mariners  there  distinguish'd by the Name of  Tchurmah  who are kept as Slaves by People in the Towns which border on the Sea and hir'd to serve the Summer out on board the Gallies where for Six Months Drudgery at the laborious Oar they receive a good Allow∣ance of Provision for the Voyage and about the Sum of Five and Twenty Pounds at their Return which is the sole Right and Property of their respective Masters who live an Idle and Inglorious Life upon the toilsom Labours and unpitied Miseries of their Fellow Creatures  IN case there still requires a fresh Recruit they send a certain Number of their sturdiest Seamen to rove from Place to Place about the Provin∣ces which border on their Capital and there Impress the lustiest Clowns they find amongst them till by this Addition they compleat the Number which the Service of the  Sultan  then demands  An admirable Policy  THESE last are call'd  Azaps  or Clowns and as least Useful to the Necessities of their Emperour are still least Burthensome to his Treasury for tho' their Pay is equal to the rest it Costs the Government not one sole Farthing for out of every Five and Twenty Families they claim a Right to one  Azap  and for his Maintenance that Summer the other Four and Twenty Houses are oblig'd to raise an equal Sum of Money to reward his Service  BESIDES these several Orders of the  Turkish  Seamen there remains another to be spoken of which consists of those condemn'd Delinquents of the  Christian  Churches subject to their Tyranny whose Crimes or evil Fate have chain'd their Bodies to the Oar of Slavery whence Death alone has Power to free them these with such of the  Maltese Venetian Spanish  or  Italian  Mariners as have unfortunately been the Prize of War are kept  Misery of  Gal∣leySlaves  together void of Hope in endless Misery never to enjoy their Ravish'd Li∣berty till the Pitying Sea demands their Bodies Worn and Meagre by continual Labours or the Happy turn of a Successfull Battle shall with Joy give back again that Darling Blessing which it once took from 'em  The Yearly Voyage of the  Turkish  Fleet of  Galleys  THE  Turkish  Galleys thus Equip'd set Sail for a large Port upon the  Hellespont  now call'd  Gallipolis  Their Number ne'er exceeds one Hundred nor can the Mighty Power of the  Turkish Sultan  maintain a greater Fleet tho' oft Attempted Hence they Sail as  War  or  Business  leads their Admi∣ral from Isle to Isle round all the Tributary Islands of the  Archepilago  to awe the Natives from Rebellion or Disorder or Preserve their Shoars from the Repeated Insults of their  Christian  Enemies till having spent the time Allotted for their Absence they return again to the Port of  Constan∣tinople  and Discharging all their Hired Seamen Place the Galleys in their former Stations and retire to their Respective Habitations till Approach∣ing Spring Invites their Officers to Renew their Care and Summon Back the Marriners to their Abandon'd Duty  Beyes  of the  Archipalago  BESIDES the Fleet Immediately depending on the  Sultan  's Admiral there are a certain Number under Twenty of the Lords or Governours of the abovenam'd Islands who by the Tenure of their several Govern∣ments are still Oblig'd to Joyn the Navy every Summer with each a well appointed Galley under his Command when every Prize they Chance to Take is the undoubted Right and Property of their  Sultan  but when in Winter they continue Cruizing after the Return of their High Admiral and his Navy whatever Prize their Fortune gives 'em is their own by Law and by themselves Possess'd as Lawfull Booty  A great Over∣sight in their Governments  THE Fatal cause of that Unsinew'd Weakness in the  Turkish  Nvay may not be Improperly Assign'd to their Unskilfull Practice in the Art of Navigation guiding with a sort of Listless Application their Un∣polish'd rules of Maritine Improvements and so Confiding in the sure Perfection of the  Christian  knowledge in that usefull Science that with∣out the least Examination into the Pretensions of a Renegado they Im∣mediately advance him to the Post of Gunner SailMaker Carpenter or Boatswain never doubting his Accomplishment in a Study which they look upon as natural to the Natives of a  Christian  Country  I know not whether it proceeds from a mean Despair of being able to Exceed or Equal us in Sea Affairs or is the Luxurious Effect of their Prodigious Plenty and those Rich Dominions they Possess by Land which Tempts their Inclinations to a Gross and Unmolested Enjoyment of their Unmeasur'd Wealth and draws away their minds from that Industrious Application they must long time use before they can Attain a full Perfection in that neglected Science But Plain and Undeniable Demonstration convinces us that they Affect not in the least becoming Formidable by a Powerful Navy never Venturing into distant Oceans and very Rarely out of sight of Land Sailing always by Direction of certain False and Illdesign'd  SeaCharts  Mechanically Drawn without the Smallest knowledge of a Mathematical Proportion and as a Cloak to Shroud the Shamefull Ignorance which Reigns among them make Fre∣quent use of an Inglorious Proverb  A  Turkish  Pro∣verb  viz That God hath given the  Land  to  their  Possession and thought fit to leave the  Sea  to the Dominion of the Infidels  IN former Ages the  Grand Signior  cou'd by Virtue of his great Au∣thority at any time Oblige the  Algierines  with those of  Tunis Tripoly  Morocco Fez  and other Parts of  Africa  to come with Powerful Ships of War to his Assistance  The  Pyrates  of  Barbary  Inde∣pendant on the  GrandSig∣nior  but the Princes of those Country's having lately much Encreas'd their  Power  as well as  Policy  find constant Means by some Excuse to Quitt his Service nor Approach his Empire but in Order to Recruit their own with Fresh Supplies of Men and Plunder while they Frequently Attack such  Graecian  Islands as are under the Pro∣tection of the  Turkish Sultan  and Artfully contrive to Play the Pirate by Lying off at Sea without the Reach of any Fort or Castle that upon Complaint by those they Injure to the Officers of the  Grand Signior  those Avaricious Ministers who  Ʋnderhand  receive their Shares of all the Booty may have a fair Pretence for the Refusing to demand a Legal Satisfaction as knowing it beyond their Power to Revenge the Injury  HAVING lately spoken of the Miserable Fate wherein such Wretches find themselves Involv'd as are by the Unhappy Chance of War be∣come the Slaves of an Inhumane Enemy it may not be Unwelcome to Relate a Story of the Particulars whereof I was Inform'd by many People who were Witnesses to the Truth of most of its Uncommon Passages  A strange Sto∣ry of a  Turkish  Slave redeem∣ed from Servi∣tude  SIGNIOR PIETRO CORNARO  a Young Accomplish'd Gentleman of an Ancient Family and considerable Fortune in the City of  FERRARA  in  Italy  was led not many Years ago to Travel thro' the Various Provinces of his Celebrated Country that by Improving his Experience he might Entirely Satisfie his Eager Curiosity and Enrich his Mind with such Refin'd Notions as wou'd distinguish his Perfections from the far less Qualifi'd and common Conversation of his Fellow Citizens  HE came amongst other Places to  Leghorne  and took up Lodgings at an Inn in order to Observe the Rarities of that well Peopled City and Hapning to be Plac'd in an Appartment that Op'ned to the Pub∣lick Street wou'd often take a Morning Walk about his Room and looking Frequently upon the Street Divert himself Agreeably by a Curious Observation of whatever Pass'd before him  A Privilege of Slaves in  Leghorne  TIS a Custom of the Town abovemention'd to Enlarge the  Turks  who serve 'em as their Slaves and give them Liberty to Ply as Por∣ters or betake themselves to any other Toilsome Drudgery Obliging them to Pay their Masters such a Daily Sum of Money as is Judg'd convenient and Permitting them to keep the little Overplus to serve Occasionally their own Necessities  A Virtuous Curiosity  DIRECTLY Opposite to  Signior Pietro  's Chamber was a Bench on which he often saw a Melancholy  Turk  sit Thoughtfull and Dejected Leaning Pensively his Head upon his Hand and Dropping now and then a Silent Tear which he Endeavour'd Secretly to Wipe away with a large Knott of Ropes the Wretched Badge of his Unfortunate Employment The Frequent Repetition of this Mournfull Practice tho' begun too Early for a Publick Observation was perceiv'd with Won∣der by the Compassionate  Italian  who Earnestly desirous to become Acquainted with the reasons of his Sorrow sent at last a Messenger to Fetch him and having Carry'd him Directly to his own Appartment Discours'd a while and Askt him several Questions in the  Italian  Lan∣guage wherein the  Turk  had then Attain'd Considerable Knowledge and Receiving Answers  Modest  and  Particular  Proceeded to demand the manner of his being Taken and how long he had continued in that State of Slavery  WITH wringing Hands and elevated Looks which seem'd to blame his Starrs for his unpity'd Misery The poor disconsolate  Mahometan  be∣gan his Tale and water'd his Complaint with showers of Tears whose falling Streams spoke piercing Proofs of his ungovernable Sorrow I am says he an honest  Musse  man  never Friend to  War  or  Rapine  but became a Sacrifice to both in an unlucky Visit to an Aged Father then in Health and Peace at  Cyprus  now perhaps laid Cold and Breathless in some gloomy Grave and may have broke his Heart to hear my Misery  THESE sad Complaints were follow'd mournfully by a sincere and full Account of every Accident which had concurr'd unfortunately to re∣duce him to this Slavery he soon at large inform'd his kind Inquirer that he had sorrowfully spent Four tedious Years in that Condition which had left Three Wives Two Sons now Men and Nine small Children drown'd in Grief for his unlucky Loss and wholly destitute of any means whereby to know his present Habitation  THE pitying Breast of  Signior Pietro  fram'd for tender and compas∣sionate Impressions melted generously with Sympathetical Concern to hear the wretched and forlorn Condition of this complaining Infidel and asking him his Name and other things he thought convenient he gave him Money and dismiss'd him kindly with a Word or two of Comfort  A generous Compassion  THE  Turk  return'd disconsolately back to the unwelcom Practice of his daily Labours and the tendernatur'd  Signior Pietro  seriously reflecting on his weighty Sorrow and considering that the Will of Providence or some unthought of Turn of fickle Chance might one Day make the Case his own and teach him by the bitter Proofs of sad Experience how to pity others Miseries by the insupportable Extremity of his own Misfor∣tunes he resolv'd to do a noble Act of  Christian  Charity and making In∣terest with the Governour of the Town found means to get the  Turk  Releas'd for the Ransom of about One Hundred Forty Five Duc∣cats  NEVER could more welcome and surprizing News rejoyce the Heart of Humane Sufferer than that which brought the happy  Turk  the News of his Delivery with rapid Transports of ungovern'd Joy he fell upon his Knees embrac'd the Feet of his ador'd Redeemer and with numerous Vows of hearty Gratitude entreated  Signior Pietro  to inform him how he might return  twice told  that friendly Sum which had so ge∣nerously purchas'd him his valued Liberty  An honoura∣ble Liberality  THE Good  Italian  wish'd him well but told him he expected no Re∣turn yet if his Soul was Noble and wou'd urge him to be Grateful he only ask'd his solemn Promise that he wou'd at his Return Redeem from Slavery some  Christian  Gentleman whom he shou'd think did most deserve it and send him back as soon as possible to visit once again his Native Country This last Agreement was in fine c  ncluded on and the deli∣ver'd  Turk  supplied with Cloaths and all things necessary embark'd on board an  English  Vessel bound for  Turkey  and return'd successfully to his former Habitation  THERE pass'd about Three Months beyond the Day of the  Maho∣metan  's Departure from  Leghorne  when  Signior Pietro  having been the greatest Part of that time in  Venice  pleas'd extreamly with the City and its People became enamour'd of a Lady Young and Beautiful call'd  Maria Margarita Delfino  who had for several Years resided in that Town under  the Roof and Care of a substantial Merchant youngest Brother to her Fa∣ther who with her Sisters and the major Part of her Relations liv'd at  Malta  Nothing cou'd disswade the Amorous  Italian  from a violent Ex∣pression of his growing Passion he sollicited her Uncle with incessant Im∣portunities and at last engag'd him to permit him to Address her upon this Condition that he should accompany his Niece and him to  Malta  there to gain her Father's Approbation of his Person and Condition This he promis'd and continued Four Months daily visiting the Object of his Affection till he gain'd entirely her Consent to Marry him when she was Authoriz'd to do it by her Father's Order and it seems their Sympathetic Ornaments of  Mind  and  Body  pointed out the Match and spoke 'em only Worthy of each others Value  A strange Mis∣fortune which befel a Lover and his Mi∣stress  THEY Embark'd upon a Vessel Bound for  Malta  and belonging to that Island which they were almost arriv'd in Sight of when a  Turkish  Gally met and boarded them making undistinguish'd Prize of all her Car∣go and transporting  Signior Pietro  with his Mistress and her Uncle into threatned Slavery landing them at  Smyrna  together with the Valuable Prize in which they took them  OH Strange Uncertainty of Humane Life blind mad Event of fickle Fortune How much in vain do thoughtless Mortals boast the Blessings of a Worldly Grandeur when the sudden Turns of War or Accident destroy Tyrannically in one poor Moment the stateliest Pillars of that fansied Greatness upon which Foundation we so vainly Build our Hopes of Happiness  A very odd and surprizing Turn of For∣tune  I forgot to tell you that the Three Companions in this miserable State had chang'd their Cloaths for course and rougher Habits when they saw the Danger they were falling into that being so disguis'd they might ex∣pect a Ransom from a smaller Charge than otherwise would serve 'em so that being taken with the Common People they were like them  in Chains  conducted to the Publick Market where the Slaves are  Bought  and  Sold  like Sheep or Oxen  Signior Pietro  and the young Ladies Uncle were ty'd to∣gether and plac'd with many more to wait the Purchase of the fairest Bid∣der opposite to them the Poor Unhappy Lady stood  half dead  with Fear and Anguish with a numerous Crowd of  Christian  Women Young and Old expecting every Moment to be Bought and torn away from any hopes of seeing ever more her Lover and Relation  A grating Trial of a Lo∣ver's Patience  WHO cou'd now express the swelling Grief conflicting Passions and tumultuous Agonies wherewith these poor  desponding  Lovers view'd each other yet not daring to discover their Concern for fear their Love should double their Misfortunes till at last a young and graceful  Turk  came up to the disconsolate  Maria  and bargaining immediately with the Officer who kept her paid the Money and throwing on a Veil he brought on purpose took her from the rest and carry'd her away with an extraordina∣ry Satisfaction  MANY a Complaining Look did the despairing Lady give her Friends who answer'd her with all the mournful Marks of silent Lamentation and were now especially the Lover so confounded with their Misery that they stood insensible like Marble Statues looking stedfastly upon the Ground and took no notice of the many Purchasers who walk'd about from Place to Place to view the Persons of the wretched Captives  WHILE they stood thus fix'd in Contemplation on the transitory Blessings of a Mortal Life there came a  Turk  from Stall to Stall enquiring  earnestly of every Officer what Quality and Country their several Slaves laid claim to and examining particularly the Slaves themselves to the same Effect at last he came to  Signior Pietro  who holding down his Head the  Turk  stoop'd forward to look upon his Face a Courtesy not often put in Practice by those barbarous People who when a Slave refuses to hold up his Face will generally take them roughly by the Chin as when a Jockey looks upon a Horses Mouth and rudely force 'em to expose their Counte∣nances  A lucky Ac∣cident  The  Turk  no sooner saw the Face but starting back in great Surprize he rais'd his Arms and Eyes towards Heaven and half tran∣sported at the strange Discovery cry'd out aloud  I thank thee Holy Pro∣phet thou hast guided well my lucky Footsteps  The griev'd  Italian  looking up at this surprizing Exclamation saw before his Eyes that very Man whom in  Leghorn  he had so kindly freed from Slavery no Pen can tell the Rap∣tures he must needs conceive at this so happy Meeting swift Embraces follow'd their Surprize and when the Wonder of the  Turk  would give him leave to speak again he thus address himself to  Signior Pietro  A memorable Piece of gra∣titude  I promis'd thee  said he  thou best of Christians that I wou'd certainly redeem such Slave from Servitude as I shou'd judge did more than any else deserve that Blessing and now thank  Mahomet  in thee I have discover'd him  with that he order'd him who guarded them to send some Person to receive his Ran∣som and conduct him presently to his own House The overjoy'd  Italian  heard with Pleasure the Design of his accomplish'd Gratitude but told him  if he would be doubly kind he might Redeem his Friend who suffer'd with him and they wou'd find some speedy Means to reimburse his utmost Charges  the Proposition was embrac'd as soon as offer'd and a Person being sent to take the Money receiv'd immediately the Ransoms he demanded and returning to the Market left the Gentlemen in the Care of their Redeemer  Another strange Sur∣prise  THE  Turks  Two Sons when told the Accident by which their Father met the Man to whom before he ow'd his Liberty express'd sincere and grateful Joy and bid them welcome with an inexpressible Civility and after having heard the manner of their being Taken and their sor∣rowful Complaint for loss of an unhappy Virgin whom they lov'd so dear∣ly he who was the Eldest of the Two cry'd out with earnestness  Now by the Religion of our Prophet and his People my Father's House contains this Virgin  and thereupon proceeded to inform them he had bought that ve∣ry Morning a young  Christian  Slave to wait upon his Mother and his Fa∣ther's other Wives that she had giv'n the same Account as they had done of the particulars of her Captivity that she was then above among the Women and he wou'd for satisfaction fetch her down that very Moment  'TIS easy to imagine the Disorder of their Breasts possess'd alternate∣ly by  Hope  and  Fear  which rag'd impetuously and rack'd their Minds till Doubt gave way and boundless Joy o'erspread their Souls to see the Person they so lately lost conducted to their Arms by him to whom the Laws of  Turkey  gave her up as lawful Purchase  THEY staid a Week with their kind Landlord who wou'd not rest till he had likewise Ransom'd Two Men Servants and a Maid who waited on the Lady these together with as many of their Goods and Cloaths as he could purchase from the  Turk  who took them he bestow'd again upon their lawful Owners gave them a considerable Sum of Money and contriv'd to get them Passage on a Vessel of  Marseilles  then Bound for  Malta  SIGNIOR PIETRO  the young Lady and her Uncle frequently Endeavour'd to Oblige this Honest  Turk  to take their Bills or find some other method to secure his Money but he Persisted in a Positive Refusal of their smallest Proffers telling  Signior Pietro  the Debt was Paid before it was Contracted and would often lay his Hand Devoutly on his Bosom and with a Zealous Sigh repeat this Proverb  A  Turkish  Pro∣verb  The God of Heaven has given us Plenty that we may give from God where need requires it  Moral reflecti∣ons on the In∣stability of Fortune  THIS Story tho Digressive from the Subject of the Chapter may perhaps so far divert the Reader as to make a full Atonement for its Undesign'd Prolixity since a Moral Observation may thereby be made and Teach us happily so well to use our Charitable Opportunities that we may reasonably Hope if once our Fate shou'd Chance to be Inverted duely to receive that Measure of Compassion which our former Mercy Heap'd Abundantly on those who wanted it always bearing in our Me∣mories that the Transitory Smiles of Worldly Fortune tho' they make a Blessing  Great  can never make it  Fix'd  or  Permanent  that  KINGS  and  BEGGARS  are alike the Sport of Chance and those who  Rule  to Day may  Serve  to Morrow while the  Blanks  and  Prizes  of our Frail Mortality Pro∣claim Alternately the  Good  or  Ill  of Humane Life uncertain as a  Lottery  BUT to return to what I Undertook to speak of Such as before De∣scrib'd is now the Greatest Naval Power which the  Turkish Sultan  's Boast Possession of and while the Reader may be led to Wonder at the Blindness of those Enemies to  Christendom  he wou'd do well to Praise the Mercies of that God who by his Undeserv'd and Boundless Providence vouch∣safes to Curb the Wild desires of an Ambitious Government by not Per∣mitting them to know their Interest and Improve those vast peculiar Oppor∣tunities their Provinces afford them to the Terrour or Destruction of his Church and People  A Powerfull Navy the Glo∣ry of a Nation  THE Numerous Advantages a Nation gains defended Formidably by a Warlike Navy are beyond dispute the Pillars of her State and chief Promoters of her envied Glories since a People strengthen'd by a Powr'full Fleet not only reap Advantages from Foreign Traffick and become thereby Immensely Rich at home but are Enabled fully to ex∣tend their Conquests to the spacious Earths remotest Corners and become free Denizons of all the Countries of the Habitable World  The decay of Naval Force among the  Turks  an O∣men of their Downfall  THAT therefore these Aspiring and Ambitious Infidels instead of having gain'd a double knowledge of the useful Art of Navigation as their daily Conquests swell'd their Empire have extreamly Slacken'd their oncewarm Endeavours and begin to slight Marine Improvements may well be look'd upon as an undoubted Proof of their declining State and Sinking Grandeur and many reasonable Causes joyn to Prompt a  Christian  's hope that he may live to Triumph in the downfall of a Throne whose Black Foundation fix'd its Greatness on the Bloody Overthrow of Injur'd Princes and the Undistinguish'd Slaughter of Invaded Na∣tions  NOR are the  Turks  insensible of their Weakness they know they lie entirely open to the Insults of the  Muscovites  who lately forc'd a Passage through the  Euxine Sea  and sent a Ship of Guns which brought on Board the  Czar  's Embassador and coming to an Anchor at the Point of the  Grand Signior's Seraglio  saluted and surpriz'd the City with a whole Broadside never was there seen a greater Consternation which continued with un∣common Hurry and Destraction till 'twas Publickly Proclaim'd he came to bring their Emperour a Compliment from  Moscovy  since that they  have repair'd some Castles on the Entrance of the  Bosphorus  and  Black Sea  but never built one Vessel more nor taken any requisite Precaution in order to withstand the growing Danger which alarm'd their Fears from so undreaded and remote a Corner  CHAP VI Of the Tenets of their Faith and how differing from the  Persians  The  Turkish Alcoran  or Body of their Faith  THREE Noted Books among the  Turks  Direct their Faith and Dictate their Religion The  ALCORAN  or Body of their Law and Faith was first Compil'd by the Impostor  Mahomet  assisted by the Pen of  Sergius  a Monk this Book is written in  Arabian  Verse but  rough  and  inharmonious  nor must be either read or written in another Language 'tis like the  Gospel  amongst  Christians  Sa∣cred and Incontrovertible and approach'd Devoutly with a zealous Kiss nor must be  touch'd  by  Christians  or the  unwash'd  Hands of  Turks  them∣selves The Titles under which it passes are agreeable to their Opinion of its Doctrine such as Light of God Sole Guide to Paradise and Divine Director unto Heavenly Glories  The Second Book of their Religion  THE Second Book which teaches their Religion is the  Assonah  or sure Traditional Decrees of their Enlighten'd Prophets  Ebubeker Omar Haly  and  Ozmyn    The Third by whom 'twas written  The Third is call'd  The Necessary Consequences of the Books of Life or True Interpretation of the Prophet's Pleasure  Which last was written by the Ancient  Caliphs  of  Egypt  and  Babylon  whose vast Authority the Power of the Sword and Change of Governments has cen∣tur'd in the  Muftee  of the Modern  Turkish  Empire  The Five Ar∣ticles requir'd to Constitute a True  Maho∣metan  NOW tho' these Three abovenam'd Books contain the total Sum of their fallacious Doctrine yet are they inverted greatly by the various Ex∣plications and directly opposite Opinions of their Expounding Doctors But notwithstanding their Divisions into numerous  Sects  which Teach peculi∣ar Doctrines to their several Adherents there is a certain  Standard  of their Faith containing Five Religious Articles of Fundamental Piety and In∣dispensible Necessity which are requir'd to Constitute a True  Mahome∣tan  and allow'd by all sufficient Proofs to gain a  Man  of any Party or O∣pinion whatsoever the valuable Character of a True Believer  The First  is frequent Cleansing with a Pot of Water all the outward Parts of their polluted Bodies  The Second is  to Pray Five times each Day they live  The Third  to keep one Month in Twelve a Strict and Holy Fast  The Fourth  to give according to their Wealth a large Proportion to the Poor Believers  And the Fifth  to Visit once at least before they Die the Celebrated Tomb of their Impost'rous Prophet or depute some Holy Person in their Stead and Bear his Charges going and returning thro' the Num'rous Stages of that commanded Pilgrimage  The main Profession of the  Turkish  Faith  THE only Great and Noted Article of the  Turkish  Faith is centred fully in the following Profession  Allah Ekbirr Esaked hu enlah Ilah he Illallah ve esked hu enai Muhammed weesuul  The meaning of which Words in our Language may be express'd as follows  I verily believe there is but one God and Mahomet is the Prophet of that God  Other Rites and Ceremonies are only look'd upon as Tryals of Obedience and never reckon'd neces∣sary Rules to guide their Faith or forfeit tho' omitted their assur'd Salvation  Certain other Principles of their Religion  AMONGST these last may be esteem'd the Duty of their Circum∣cising Children their abstaining zealously from Blood and Swinesflesh their observing  Friday  as an holy Sabaoth their refusing Images or Pictures in their Churches and a Number more of their Religious Customs  A pleasant Notion of the  Turks  con∣cerning the Creation  THO' they acknowledge God in all his Attributes of  Great Good Just Omniscient Omnipresent  and  Incomprehensible  they deny with violence the Doctrine of the  Trinity  and not distinguishing the Sacred Union of that Heavenly Mystery are blindly led to think we Worship Three  distinct  and  separated  Godheads They believe that God Created both the World and all Things in it and relate a pleasant Story how he form'd Man of various sorts of colour'd Clay which having lain for many Thousand Years neglected in the Sun he breath'd into him the Breath of Life and being much delighted with his new Creation made the Angels Kneel down and Worship him But when the innate Pride of haughty  Satan  urg'd him to deny his God's Decree by boldly daring to dispute his Will the kindled Anger of the Great Almighty threw him headlong down to Hell with all those Angels which appear'd his Friends for which they say the  envious  Devils have since that been  unrelenting  Enemies to Hu∣mane Happiness  Their Opini∣on of our Sa∣viour  THO' they dissavow with Heat the Noblest Principles of  opposite  Chri∣stanity they do not only speak respectfully of  Jesus Christ  but own him as a Prophet far beyond the  Hebrew Moses  and inferiour only to their worshipp'd  Mahomet  whom he  preceeded  with  inferior  Share of Inspiration as he  succeeded Moses  with a  greater  Portion  They deny his Crucifixion  They call him in their Books  The Breath of God  but own not his  Divinity  nor can be brought to credit his asserted  Crucifixion  which they say was inconsistent with the Justice of a God so Holy and Impartial they can by no means think he wou'd permit a Prophet whom he had endu'd with Vertue to resist all Sin Cure worst Diseases Raise the Dead and do all other Miracles to be made a Sacrifice to so Unworthy Base and Curst a People as the  Jews  then were and die so Vile a Death as  Christian  Doctrine says he suffer'd  A strange O∣pinion of the  Turks  concer∣ning  Judas  THE better to defend this Error in their Faith they have contriv'd a subtle Story how when Christ was led to die Almighty God transla∣ted him invisibly to a Place in Heaven and deceiv'd the Eyes of the de∣luded  Jews  by such prevailing and mistaking Blindness that they seiz'd on  Judas  who betray'd him to their Hands and taking him for the depar∣ted  Jesus  nail'd him to the Cross and Executed him instead of our Re∣deemer  No  Jew  per∣mitted to turn  Turk  till he becomes a  Christian  THEY believe him to have been a Virgins Son and that his Mother  Mary  Bore him at her Breasts Conceiving not by Humane Help but by the virtuous Odour of a certain  Rose  They will not suffer him to be Blasphem'd but own he will return to Judge the World some Years be∣fore its Dissolution Nay so great a Veneration do they pay his Memo∣ry that they refuse to let a  Jew  turn  Turk  till he has first espous'd  the  Christian  Faith and will from thence become a perfect  Mussul∣man  THEY quite deny the Doctrine of  Eternal Punishment  believing eve∣ry Man attended constantly in  Life  and  Death  by Two contending Angels  One  whereof is  White  and  Kind  the  Other Black Severe  and  Cruel  Such they say as die Religiously are transported soon to Joys in  Paradise  while such as live a Careless Loose Debauch'd and Sinful Life shall long be tortur'd by their  Sooty  Angel and receive a great and tedious Punishment for all past Wickedness before their White and Friendly Angel can prevail to lift 'em from the Flames of Hell and bear 'em pure and free from Stain to tast the Bliss their Paradise affords them  THE gross Absurdities of their politest Notions of a Future State are such as will undoubtedly surprize the Reader with a wonder at their Ig∣norance but are not if consider'd rightly void of Crafty and Designing Subtilties since to the rude and barbarous Natures of those unpolish'd gross and sordid People who were first deluded by the  Turkish  Superstiti∣on nothing cou'd have been a fairer Mark to draw away their Minds than those alluring Prospects of a Carnal Pleasure which so entirely suited their extravagant Desires and unrefin'd Capacities  The  Turks  odd Notion of a general Judg∣ment  THE Common Notion prevalent in  Turkey  of a General Judgment and its necessary Consequences is ridiculously Founded on the following Particulars They say the winding of a frightful Horn shall shake the World to single Atoms by the raging Force of unresisted Earthquakes God alone shall Judge all Mortals  Moses Christ  and  Mahomet  appearing severally at the Head of their respective Followers to intercede with the Almighty for the Pardon of their Sins  The Line or Bridge of Ju∣stice  That  Cain  shall lead the Num∣bers of the Damn'd all loaden heavily with Satchels full of Crimes upon their burthen'd Shoulders to pass upon a small and slippery Rope thence call'd the Line of Justice that the greatest Sinners shall be forc'd to tumble on the Rightside into prodigious Flames and scenes of Torment there to be till having expiated all their Guilt they shall be taken suddenly to Seats in Paradise while  Hell  the  Devil  and his wicked  Angels  shall be∣come annihilated by the Power of Heaven  THOSE whose Sins are less in Weight and fewer in their Number falling gently to the  Left  of this abovenam'd Line of Justice shall be ta∣ken in a nearer way to endless Bliss and undergo but very small and tri∣fling Punishments to purifie their Natures for the Tast of Happiness  Reward of Vertue  BUT as for those whose Pious Lives and Exemplary Vertues have de∣serv'd on Earth no just Reproof they shall be pois'd in Passage by their Guardian Angels and attain successfully their Throne of Joy without the trouble of the smallest Stay in either of those Places not unjustly call'd the  Turkish  Purgatories  The odd Chi∣mera's of the  Turkish  Para∣dise  PARADISE  is by the  Turks  conceiv'd a spacious Land o'erspread engagingly with lofty Palaces inviting Shades soft murmuring Foun∣tains cooling Grotta's verdant Bowers and slow'ry Meadows adorn'd magnificently with Trees of Gold and Rocks of Diamond amidst whose soft alluring Charms the neverfading Joys of Love must bless their Hours with constant Pleasure giving each his lovely Mistress rich in Beauty and accomplish'd Sweetness both of Mind and Body never subject to the Earthly Passions or Deficiencies of Nature Pure and Perfect in their Forms and Substance daily gaining back their rob'd Virginities to bestow again on those to whom before they lost 'em ever blooming in the Flower  of Youth and serv'd obsequiously by the attendant Duty of divinely Featur'd Boys or Angels and in short Enjoying in their fansy'd Paradise the ve∣ry Heigth of those Extravagant desires which are on Earth the wild and vain Effects of an Insatiate Wanton and Luxurious Appetite  Predestination  Strictly held in  Turkey  PREDESTINATION in its Highest  Extended Pitch is by the  Turks  most Zealously Mantain'd nay to such strange degrees of Height does this Opinion lift 'em that they Scruple not to look on God as the Unquestion'd Author both of  Good  and  Evil  THEY all Unanimously Acquiesce in one Belief That every Man Receives upon his Forehead at his time of Birth the Undisputed Mark of all his Future  Good  or  Ill  that  there  is Written both the Time and Man∣ner of his certain Death nor can he Possibly by any means avoid the Fate to which the Will of God has so Ordain'd him and herein they seem Ex∣actly to agree with those Expressions of the Famous  Seneca  in his Tra∣gedy of  Oedipus  A Quotation from  Seneca  Relating to  Predestination  Fatis Agimur Cedite Fatis  Non solicitae possunt Curae  Mutare  c  Guided by Fate we must Subservient be  Nor can our Care Subvert one fix'd Decree  Whate'er our Mortal Race does Undergo  Whate'er we think or Act from Heav'n must Flow  All Natures Springs move one  Appointed  Way  And the  First  Hour Points out the  Latest  Day  A very Strange and Humerous Custom of the  Turkish  People  THEY hold the Name of God so Sacred and Inviolable that they seldom speak of the divine Omnipotence without a Reverend Stroaking down their Beards and Faces nay so Carefull are they to Pre∣serve from Disrespect the Power of God that when they find the Smallest Piece of Paper fallen in the Street the Gravest Man among them will with Reverence stoop to take it up and Thrust it Closely into some small Nook or Crevice in the Walls or Houses as they pass along A Stranger wou'd be very much Surpriz'd to see the outward Cases of the  Turkish  Buildings Cram'd as full as Possible of little Rough and Rumpled Scrips of Brown and Writing Paper  Their Rea∣sons for it  THE Reasons which they give Inquiring  Christians  for the Practice of this Odd and Trifling Ceremony are Diverting and Particular for First they Judge it an unseemly Action to permit the Feet of Men or Beasts or Highway Mud which fills their Streets to Touch or Soil with their Polluted Filth a thing whereon the Name of God might Probably be Written  THE other reason which Excites the Walking  Turks  to Narrow Searches for such bits of Paper is a Notion they have got amongst them  that before they come within the Walls of their delightfull  Paradise  they must be all Oblig'd to Walk BareFooted o'er a large and Glowing Plain of RedHot Iron without Permission to have any thing Beneath their Feet but all those Former Bits of Paper which they Sav'd on Earth from being Trampled on by the Polluted Tread of  Men  or  Horses  The  Turks  Un∣gratefull for their Womens Favours  WOMEN are but rarely suffer'd to appear in  Mosques  and then are plac'd  all over Veil'd  behind a large and darken'd Lettice for the  Turks  however fond of Female Conversation and wholly given up to wanton  Dalliances and the warm Caresses of their Womens Persons are so far from placing like our amorous  Christians  Flames and Darts Death Wounds and Lightning in a Ladies Eye that they inhumanely deny their Dovelike Women even so much as one poor Place in that enchanting Pa∣radise which we like more indulgent Lovers make our Mistresses the sole Disposers of  The  Turkish  Ladies are de∣ny'd a Place in  Paradise  THE fine Virginityrestoring Ladies I so lately spoke of are not such as here on Earth the  Turks  Enjoy but fine newform'd and shining Crea∣tures purposely Created for the Place they dwell in while the poor for∣gotten Objects of their Worldly Love remain without in Places far less Bright and Glorious nor are allow'd one distant View of those transpor∣ting Joys in whose Possession their oncelov'd and stately Lords now live in Raptures  AND now to give you  British  Ladies an enlivening Tast of  Turkish  Arrogance to your deserving Sex and let you see how little Cause you have to grieve that we possess a just and mild Preheminence by Natures Laws and those of  Matrimony  I'll venture to Translate a famous Song now much in Vogue among the celebrated  Beaux  and  Belles  of  Turkey  You'l pardon Ladies if it wants the Spirit of a Good Translation since where the Subject does not please the jaded Pen will very rarely reach Perfection The Song shou'd seem to have been made by some successless Lover on his meeting a Repulse from one he Courted for his Fourth and Favorite Consort  I  A very odd and comical  Turkish  Song  Three Wives I boast as black as Jet  And Comely as the Pine  'Mongst all the Three I never met  A Baulk to one Design  O  Mahomet  O Prophet you who can  Hear and Revenge an Injur'd  Mussulman  II  A Short and Fair late won my Heart  And her I wou'd have blest  She shou'd have had of Love a Part  Superior to the Rest  O  Mahomet  O Prophet you who can  Hear and Revenge an Injur'd  Mussulman  III  But she deny'd the proffer'd Bliss  And durst

time will come when I shall see  The poor inferior Wretch in Hell  Not Worthy once to look on me  Then slight conceited Slave if there you can  The proffer'd Courtship of a  Mussulman  The  Turks  for∣bid the Use of Wine  THE Use of Wine is in the  Alcoran  forbid the  Turks  on pain of the se∣verest Anger of their  God  and Prophet yet they Publickly express their great Dislike of that Injunction by the frequent drinking it in largest Quantities in Men of Years and grave Appearance 'tis esteem'd a Crime beyond Excuse to be inclin'd to common Drunkenness and Men of High and  Envied Posts  are careful how they show the smallest Inclination to the like Intemperance lest they shou'd give a joyful Opportunity to their ob∣serving Enemies to blame the Follies of their several Governments as an impure Effect of lov'd Ebriety But Men of Gay and Sprightly Tempers Young and unimploy'd in State Affairs affect the Practice of continual Drinking  Yet drink it to Extrava∣gance  nor is the Use of Wine by them conceiv'd as Sovereign by its  Virtues  or  enlivening  Qualities but by the downright Operation of a pow'rful  Quantity  which skrews their Spirits to a strange Extravagance and robs 'em wholly of their  delug'd  Reason by the moist Effects of its  in∣toxicating  Nature  THERE is a Custom I observ'd amongst the  Turks  that they will often visit  Christian  Merchants at their Country Houses where retir'd from fear of Publick Observation they have convenient Time and Opportunity to Carouse at Pleasure till becoming downright Drunk and Mad they run immediately to mount their Horses and tho' scarce able to continue on their Feet when fix'd securely in their Saddles begin to Spurr with rest∣less Fury riding up and down from Hill to Valley in a constant Gallop till they grow again sedately Sober and return to take a formal Leave of him whose Wine they quass'd so freely of  THERE goes a pleasant Story of the Cause why  Mahomet  prohi∣bited the Use of Wine to all his Followers which is related by the  Turks  themselves with these Particulars  A Story how  Mahomet  came to forbid his Followers the Use of Wine  THERE was a certain Shepherd in the Neighbourhood of  Meccha  whose Possessions were so far Superior to the rest of his Fraternity that he was Chosen as a Ruler of their whole Society and exercis'd a sort of mild Authority by the joint Permission of the Shepherds of that Country  IT happen'd that this Man oppos'd with violence the Doctrine of the Impostor then but newly vented in those very Parts wherein he liv'd and all the Brotherhood depending upon him as on their Lord and Oracle The crafty  Mahomet  perceiv'd it difficult without his Friendship to accomplish his Designs and so resolv'd to court his Favour by the most respectful Marks of Honour and Civility  ACCORDINGLY he came one Day to make a Visit to this pow'rful Shepherd attended pompously by a magnificent and numerous Retinue it hapned that a Daughter of this honest Mans was that Day Marry'd and a splendid Entertainment made to feast those many Guests who grac'd her Nuptials when the Prophet enter'd he saluted kindly all the Company with his most hearty Blessing and sat him freely down among the rest pretending great and wond'rous Satisfaction in their agreable and pleasant Conversation  The first and best Effect of Wine  THE merry Company a little Elevated with the Fumes of Wine for∣got their Hatred to the Doctrine which he taught and pleas'd to see him so familiar and respectful grew extreamly fond of the Impostor's Person shaking him by the Hand embracing him with fervour and saluting him with Kisses on his Cheeks and Forhead  BUT Business leading him a little farther he began to take his leave and was detain'd against his Will by the uncommon Kindness of the Shep∣herd and his Family who wou'd by no means suffer him to go till he en∣gag'd himself by solemn Promise to return again as soon as he had ended what small Business he was then to go about He went and finish'd in an Hour or Two the utmost of his Task and made all hast imaginable to be there again imputing the Excess of their Civilities to the Virtue of the Wine they drank so plentifully which he therefore bless'd with oft repea∣ted Orders to his numerous Disciples that they shou'd thenceforth drink a double Quantity of that Celestial Liquor whose Effects produc'd such peaceable Engagements and had Power to change the sharpest Hatred in∣to Love and make a Friend of a profess'd and open Enemy  The last and worst Effect thereof  BUT when he came again among them he perceiv'd a mighty Change in all their Humours they were now become entirely Drunk and turn'd the late Expressions of their Kindness into rude ungovern'd and tumultu∣ous Violence him whom so lately they address'd with Kisses now they Curse and strive to Murder Noise and Discord Fighting and Distraction were the only Scenes he had before him and in short with much ado e∣scap'd alive from their oppressive Injuries  THE  New Effect  of this mistaken Liquor urg'd the Prophet to a  New Decree  as much against it as the First had been in favour of it for per∣ceiving now it cou'd excite Disorder and give birth to  Broils  as well as  Mirth  he chang'd the Sentence he so lately gave and made it an  Haraum  for ever after or  Abomination  not to be encourag'd by the Children of his People  The  Turks  and  Persians  much divided in Re∣ligious Mat∣ters  THESE are the prevailing Tenets of the  Turkish  Faith but differ widely from the  Persian  Doctrine which last Nation tho' the Followers of  Mahomet  and his Religion do  notwithstanding that  prefer before him  Hali  his Successor and Usurper of his Empire by the Claim of Marriage with the Prophet's Daughter who in the end was overthrown and slain by  Ebubeker Omar  and  Osmyn  whose Opinions are at present follow'd as believ'd Inspir'd like  Mahomet  himself by all the  Turks  depending on the Government of the  Grand Signior  But as for  Persia  She adheres intirely to the Thoughts of  Hali  and esteems him not Inferior even to their fam'd Impostor  THESE dissenting Notions and encreasing Differences in Opinion have at last so far extended their pernicious Influences that from small and gradual Breaches they are now burst out to open Hatred of each others Persons complaining mutually that either Side has added  to  or taken  from  the Substance of their  Alcoran  as has been most agreable to their respective Interests and the promotion of their own Opinions  NAY to such unbounded Madness does their Hate arise that not con∣tented to heap Loads of dreadful Curses on each others Heads they set themselves in every Point directly opposite to one anothers Notions the  Turks  remaining censur'd as  Schismatical  by the adverse Exposition of the  Persian  Creed and  Persia  Stigmatis'd for wilfull Heresy in more than  Seven∣ty  Places of the  Turkish Alcoran  A rude and barbarous Proof of dis∣respect  THUS will the  Turks  revile that  Hali  whom the  Persians  own as their Infallible Director and the  Persians  in return to mock the Objects of the  Turkish  Worship raise in  Sugar  at their Marriage Feasts the Figures of the Three respected Friends of  Mahomet  viz  Ebubeker Omar  and the forenam'd  Osmyn  when growing merry in their drunken Cups the Bride∣groom and his Fellows draw their Scymetars and with a spightful Scoff and noisy Mockery first cut them down from top to bottom and then proceed to melt the numerous Pieces as a means to sweeten their Sherbets and other Liquors  'TIS from a natural Aversion that the favourite Colour  Green  which by the  Turks  is only worn about the Head and Noblest Parts is by the  Persians  chosen to make their Breeches Shoes or Drawers and employ'd continually in all the most indecent disrespectful Uses which a Man can possibly invent to put it to  Several diffe∣rences be∣tween the  Turkish  and the  Persian  Tenets  THE  Turks  esteem it necessary to resort in frequent Numbers to the Publick  Mosques  to pray  conjointly  for the Grace of God and Blessing of their Prophet but the  Persians  hold it only needful to convene at Churches in a full Assembly there to make an open Declaration of their fix'd Belief without the Duty of a general Prayer to Heaven for Mercy  THE  Persians  never Shave the Hair upon their Upper Lip but cut and trim the Beard upon their Chin according to the various Forms their se∣veral Fancies lead 'em to make Choice of whereas the  Turks  preserve with care a very  long  and  spreading  Beard esteeming the Deficiency of that  respected  Ornament a shameful Mark of servile Slavery  SWINESFLESH and the Use of Wine deny'd the  Turks  with strictest Prohibition are by the  Persians  practis'd with a fond Indulgence nor do the  last  distinguish Meats by  Clean  and  Ʋnclean  but enjoy promi∣scuously the common Gifts of Nature's Liberality  THE  Persians  when they wash their Feet before they Pray do seldom more than stroke the outward Part with their Right Hand just dipp'd in Water and hold it a superfluous Ceremony to rub hard as if they wash'd a∣way the Dirt which  last  the  Turks  believe a Duty of assur'd and  indispensi∣ble  Necessity  A Number more of suchlike opposite and contradictory Opinions di∣vide the Faith and Interests of these Powerful Neighbours who invent a yearly Store of black  Invectives  to attack alternately each others Doctrine amongst which Curses none are more surprizing odd and comical than these which follow  The Curses common be∣tween the  Turks  and  Persians  MAY your fatigu'd and hated Soul find no more Rest when damn'd to Purgatory than a  Christian  's Hat enjoys on Earth  By this I guess they meant to ridi∣cule our  European  Custom of Saluting oneanother with our Heads unco∣ver'd  May your transmuted Soul become in Hell an hackney Ass for even the  Jews  themselves to ride about on  These and many others needless to insert are fashionable Curses and in frequent use among the Hotbrain'd  Zealots  of each Adverse Party  THUS have I at large set down the most material Articles of  Turkish  Faith which if the Reader looks upon as gross absurd and void of Rea∣son let him direct his Praise to that Great Being whose enlight'ning Rays of Mercy and Compassion have inspir'd his Soul to Steer aright and miss the stormy Seas of Pride and Ignorance  YET this the  Turks  agree upon with us that tho' they differ in their Notions of the Godhead yet they own One Great Supreme and Sacred Being to whose unlimited and mighty Power the Earth Mankind and all Things else owe their Existence And it is observable that tho' most Nations vary in their Opinions yet they own conjointly One Superior Es∣sence as is observ'd ingeniously by  Lactantius  in the following Expressions  All People un∣der different Notions own One God  OMNIƲM Sententia quamvis sit incerta ebdem tamen spectat ut Provi∣dentiam unam esse consentiant Sive enim Natura sive Aether sive Ratio sive Mens sive Fatalis Necessitas sive Divina Lex idem est quod a nobis dicitur DEƲS  THE Opinions of all Men tho' never so uncertain tend directly to one common Center and agree unanimously upon one conspicuous Provi∣dence Which is that be it Nature Light Reason Understanding de∣stin'd Fate or the Divine Decree 'tis still the same with that which we distinguish by the Name of GOD  CHAP VII Of the Ceremonies of the  Turkish  Religion  The many In∣conveniencies of  Turkish  Su∣perstition  A STRICT Adherence to the dangerous Tenets which Com∣pose the foregoing Chapter have expos'd the  Turks  to constant Troubles that strange inhumane Tyranny and barbarous Vio∣lence with which their haughty Arms have crush'd the  Christi∣ans  have oblig'd whole Nations to become their Enemies The rash and inconsiderate Doctrine of  Predestinated  Fortune has expos'd their Lives by an imprudent and unnecessary Scorn of Danger from the fatal Influences of contagious Pestilence their false Belief of a Sublime Reward for Death in Battle has excited Thousands of their bravest Soldiers to forget the Charms of Life and Liberty and run directly on the Mouths of Cannons  YET tho' they see these many Inconveniencies and have  doubtless  some amongst them who have now discover'd the fallacious Principles of their impure Religion they persist with obstinacy in the strictest Practice of its weakest Precepts like those whom  Marius Victor  censures sharply in the following Verses  Nil Hostes nil dira Fames nil denique Morbi  Egerunt fuimus qui nunc sumus ijsque periclis  Tentati Nihilo meliores reddimur unquam  Sub vitijs nullo culparum fine manentes  In vain dire  Hunger Foes  and  Sickness  strove  The fix'd Intention of our Souls to move  What  once  we  were  we strongly  still remain  And the same Snares  once  felt  now  fell again  No length of Time can our stiff Natures bend  We live 'midst Show'rs of  Vice  and  Sin  that knows no End  The danger of entering a  Tur∣kish  Mosque  THE Superstitious Ceremonies of the  Turkish  Nation are as Number∣less as they appear Extravagant nor is it easy to obtain Admittance where we may become Eyewitnesses of their devout Retirements for so severely do they Guard their Publick Mosques from  Christian  Observation that shou'd an heedless and unwary Stranger set his Foot within their Gates at certain Seasons of extraordinary Devotion he wou'd be seiz'd immediately by watchful Officers and hurry'd headlong to a partial Magistrate whose harsh Decree admits no Bail nor any other Means of Liberty than be∣coming instantly a Member of their Faith by publickly renouncing the Divinity of Christ and owning  Mahomet  a Greater Prophet which they must Attest by the commanded Seal of instant Circumcision a severe and barb'rous Custom but must surely be Submitted to unless the Person so surpriz'd will die a Martyr to the  Christian  Faith and bravely spurn with just Contempt the proffer'd Doctrine of their vile Impostor  AND now since I have spoken of the Circumcision us'd amongst the  Turks  it will not be improper to begin with  that  in the description of their Ceremonies and acquaint my Reader with the Form whereby they put that  Act  in Execution  THEY are not by the Precepts of their  Alcoran  oblig'd to Circum∣cise their Children as a Point of Duty but continue to observe that ancient Practice from the Custom of  Arabia  long before the Time of  Mahomet  and use it now as an undoubted Mark whereby they stamp the Faith of  Mus∣sulman  on tender Infancy  The manner of Circumcising Infants in  Tur∣key  THE Act of Circumcision is perform'd by Surgeons when the Child has reach'd the Age of Seven Years and is suppos'd sufficiently Capacita∣ted to profess his Inclination to become a  Mussulman  at which time all his Friends Relations Schoolfellows  c  are Invited to a Feast and Enter∣tain'd as splendidly as their various Qualities may be thought to Merit then the Boy is brought amongst 'em and demanded whether he approves of the intended Ceremony his Assent is given by the lifting up his Finger and himself extended on a Table where the Surgeon strait performs his Office and having thrown the Skin upon a Chasingdish of Coals he baths the Wound in Salt and Water after this his Head is shav'd to one small Lock whereas before he wore his Hair dishevel'd and untouch'd by Ra∣zor this done they put him  on  a large white  Turbant  and from that time forward he becomes a Member of the  Turkish  Faith  Their Circum∣cision of a full grown Con∣vert  WHEN any  Christian  ripe in Years becomes a  Turk  and will Apo∣statize to base and sinful Superstition he is led in Triumph on a stately Horse thro' all the Great and Noted Streets to some considerable Mosque or Temple holding in his Hand an elevated Javelin the Point whereof he frequently affixes to his perjur'd Breast a silent Declaration of his Will to die for that Religion he has then embrac'd The zealous  Turks  who pass along bestow their various Presents on the shameful Wretch with very large and bounteous Liberality and being Circumcis'd in publick State he is attended back with great Solemnity receiving constantly some Means of Livelyhood by Pension from the Court or such Preferment in their  Sea  or  Land  Affairs as his Profession whilst a  Christian  speaks him sit for  Sacrifices what and how made in  Turkey  THEY have at Publick Times like those of Circumcision certain  Sa∣crifices  yet not such as formerly were us'd as Duties of Religion but are commonly the Flesh of  Sheep  or  Lambs  the  Heart  cut out and burnt in Fire while the Beast  divided  is distributed with care among the  Poor  and  Indigent  about the Neighbourhood  A strange uncommon fatal Accident fell out about the Year when I resided with his Excellency the Right Honourable the Lord  Paget then  Embassador Extraordinary at  Constantinople  Mediator and Plenipo∣tentiary at the Treaty of  Carlowitz  whose truly Great and Noble Services have left behind him an Immortal Character to the Interest and Honour of the  British  Nation and the Admiration of the  Turkish  Empire  A most un∣happy Story of the total ru∣in of a  Turkish  Family  THERE was a  Turk  who liv'd in the abovenam'd City not extrem∣ly  Rich  but  moderately  stor'd with  easy  Plenty he had a Wife so tenderly belov'd and gratefully returning a reciprocal Affection that he wou'd not use the freedom of his Country in regard to tolerated and indulg'd  Poly∣gamy  but confin'd the Treasure of his honest Love to the endearing Cen∣ter of his first Wife's Bosom He had  two  Children by his Favorite Consort one was  then  Four Years of Age the other lay a Speechless Infant in its easy Cradle when his Fruitful Wife became deliver'd of a Burthen which de∣clar'd him Father of a Third and hopeful Son  THE common Custom of a grateful Sacrifice on such Occasions led him to prepare a splendid Feast and summon all his near Relations to be Witnesses of his exceeding Joy for this new Blessing they met together in an open Court and after several usual Forms proceeded to the Place where many Sheep were kill'd to give the Poor The Person who perform'd the Ceremony cutting the Throat with a large Knife peculiar to that Office and departing with the Company to have the Sheep divided in another Place more fit for such an Action  A strange Cu∣riosity of a  Turkish  Infant  THERE was a Window open'd from the Room where the Childbed Woman with her Newborn Infant lay upon a  Saffrai  elsewhere spoken of at the Lettice of this Window stood the Eldest Son and saw with pleasure the Performance of the Ceremony He was much diverted to behold the Blood of the expiring Sheep run trickling from their Throats and taking notice that the Knife wherewith 'twas done was left behind by Chance or Negligence and that the People who attended him were  some  gone down to see the Sacrifice and those above intently busied by his Mothers Mat∣tress he endeavour'd slyly to escape Discovery and stole away without so much as being any ways observ'd by those about him  HE was no sooner out of Sight but he descended by a Case of Marble Steps directly to the Place where lay the Knife yet  red  and  reaking  with the Blood of those poor Beasts whose  bleating  Innocence it had so lately Sacrific'd  HE took it up and hiding it with all imaginable Cunning underneath his Vest return'd as slyly as he could and enter'd the Appartment he so lately left as unperceiv'd as he had just before departed from it  A Murder innocently committed  IN a low  capacious  Cradle near the Place where then the Mother lay his Second Brother not above a Twelvemonth Old was Sleeping calmly and secure from any fear by  yetunbroken  Rest and native Innocence To him the poor unhappy Boy immediately repair'd and little thinking what he was about began to practise on his tender Throat the Method he ob∣serv'd the Man to use in Butchering the Sheep design'd for  Sacrifice  The waking Child began to cry as quickly sensible it felt some Pain while still the Boy continued his Endeavours drawing  up  and  down  like some small Saw the fatal Knife and laughing heartily to see the Blood distain the Cloaths wherein his Brother lay who strugling to the utmost of his little Strength the other to maintain the Sport which so delighted him endeavour'd  hard  to keep him down and leaning  forward  with too great a Weight o'erturn'd the  Cradle  and the  Infant  in it  A melancho∣ly Conse∣quence there∣of  THE Mother whom the Cries of the assaulted Babe had just then led to look that way beheld her Son come  tumbling  out all stain'd with  Blood  and wounded  horribly  the strange surprize of such a  shocking  Pro∣spect drew her to forget her weak Condition so that rising hastily she stagger'd  inconsiderately  on the Newborn Child and treading on its Neck became its Murderer  The Third Ef∣fect of an un∣lucky Acci∣dent  THE guilty Son perceiving by the  Shrieks  and  Postures  of his Mother that he had someway or other done amiss threw down the Knife and running from her Presence to avoid the danger of a  dreaded  Punishment fell down the high and slippery Marble Steps and broke his Neck by that  unhappy  Accident  THE Mother follow'd to the fatal Place and  Swooning  at the Sight was carried back to the unlucky Chamber but the  overstrain'd Attempt  she had so lately made beyond the Strength of her  reduc'd  Condition so disorder'd all her Body that unable  long  to bear the Burthens of her  Grief  and  Weakness  she died herself some few Days after  The miserable End of an un∣happy Master of a  Turkish  Family  THE wretched Master of this miserable Family surviv'd not long the melancholy Loss of so  endear'd  a Consort and such  hopeful  Children but became thenceforth abandon'd over to a mournful  Solitude  nor could the  oftrepeated  Efforts of his dearest Friends procure him Comfort so that wholly losing all the Tast of Mortal Pleasures he began to languish  more  and  more  and e'er one Year was fully past quite broke his Heart with  weighty  Sor∣row and compleated  dismally  the last sad Scene of such a fatal and surpri∣zing  Tragedy  I have inform'd my Reader in the  foregoing  Chapter that the five  noto∣rious  and  essential  Points requir'd by  Mahomet  from all his Followers are  frequent Washings Prayers and Fasting  one whole Month  the giving Alms  proportionable to their Substance and  performing e'er they die one Pilgri∣mage to  Mecca  I shall  distinctly  treat of all these Duties in their several proper and respe∣ctive Places and as their Washing is a  previous  Ceremony to the other Four it will be requisite I shou'd begin with an Account of that  Two sorts of Washings now in use among the  Turks  IT is divided into Two distinct Formalities the  Publick Washing  in their  Baths  or  Bagnio  's and the  Private Washing  in whatever Place their  Inclina∣tions  or their  Business  find 'em  The  Turks  de∣scended from the Race of  Esau  NOW tho' their Prophet has  expressly  order'd in the Lessons of his  Al∣coran  that every  Turk  shall often Wash declaring  Cleanliness  a valuable Part of his  injoin'd  Religion yet the Custom is of more  Antiquity  than  He  by many Ages for the  Turks  derive it from the Days of  Esau  whose  Poste∣rity  they boast themselves to be descended from and therefore claim the Name of  Ishmaelites  But tho' the ancient Institution of these Washings ow'd its being to the wholesome Practice of a cleanly People and was ne∣ver meant a  Sacred Ceremony  yet the fix'd Decree of their ador'd  Impostor  has inclin'd the  Turks  to such a strange Opinion of its efficacious Virtues that they now believe the Water they make use of not alone sufficient for the cleansing all the  outward  Parts of their polluted Bodies but of Sov'reign Power to wash away their Sins and free from Guilt the most  internal  Pas∣sages of their impurest Souls  Private  Bag∣nio  's in Great Men's Houses  WE may divide their  Bagnio  's into two Sorts the First are such as  Rich  and  Noted  Persons build in some convenient Part of their own Houses  where their  Wives themselves  and all their  Servants  Bathe  conveniently  in different Divisions as often as their Duty Inclination or their leisure from Employment urge 'em to it  The Publick Baths and reason why so cheaply ac∣commodated in them  THE Second sort of  Bagnio  's are those Publick Places where for pay∣ment of a  Penny  or  Threehalfpence  they are wash'd  Politely  and supplied with  Linen  or whatever else the  Bath  requires by the diligent Attendance of  appropriated  Servants The reason why they are so cheaply serv'd is ow∣ing to the great Revenues left to  Bagnio  's by  deceas'd Mahometans  who 'mongst the other Dictates of their  Morality  hold it as a very  meritorious  Deed to build a Publick  Bagnio Hospital  or other Place of Entertainment for  benighted  Travellers and  endow  the same with an  extensive  Liberality  Men deny'd Entrance while the Wo∣men bathe  THESE  Publick Baths  are very common in their largest Cities and receive  at several Hours  prodigious Numbers of either  Sex  and every  Qua∣lity  for whose  distinct  and  separate  Accommodation they afford  divided  and  particular  Conveniencies When Women Bathe a large and  Ivoryheaded Indian  Cane is plac'd against the Door that opens from the Street and no Man dares on pain of  Death  at such a time as that claim Entrance  THE Law of  Mahomet  obliges every  Turk  to bathe his Body when he has  Caress'd  a Woman and the Ladies are oblig'd to do the same so that e∣very Morning when they rise the first Employment of the Day is washing in the  Bagnio  where they are not only cleans'd with Water but  perfum'd  and dried with  scented  Linen  Hair  how taken off without the Razor  The Heads of  Men  are daily Shav'd and  Men  and  Women  are alike injoin'd to leave no  Hair  on any other Part In order to obey which firm Decree the  meaner Sort  make use of a  compounded  Substance made of  Earth  from certain Islands of the  Archipelago  and neat∣ly mix'd with  Lime  and Drugs of proper Virtues this they beat to Pow∣der and applying it to any  Hair  they wou'd remove it takes it off as clean as possible  BUT as the frequent use of the  abovenam'd  Powder is of  dangerous  Con∣sequence if suffer'd to continue but a  moment  longer than the falling of the Hair  Some use Pincers  the more Polite and Fashionable Ladies rather choose to use the help of Pincers and  irradicate  it swiftly by a  twitching  violence  Others shav'd by Waiting Maids  yet this is only done by such as would distinguish all their Actions from the custo∣mary Practices of other People for the  Generality  of  Turkish Ladies  caring little for the Pain of using Pincers and unwilling to descend to vulgar Methods constantly appoint some favorite  Waitingmaid  to play the  Bar∣ber  and perform that Office with a  sharpedg'd Razor    st  Sort of private Wash∣ing when practis'd  THE other sort of  Washing  is divided likewise into two  distinct  Per∣formances the First is practis'd after having made the necessary  Evacuati∣ons  requir'd by Nature and  to this  they use the three last Fingers of the Left Hand on this account  the Turks of Note  have Cocks of Water run∣ning into Marble Basons in their several  Privies  and the meaner sort of Men among them never go to suchlike Places without an Earthen Pot of Water form'd commodiously with a narrow  Spout  which serves their Use on all occasions  Second sort when pra∣ctis'd  THE  second  Sort of this  last  Washing is in order to their  Prayers  for which  sole  End a numerous Quantity of  Brazen Cocks  supply large  Cisterns  plac'd in order at the Entrance of their  Churches  here they wash by way of Preparation first their  Arms Hands Head Neck Teeth  and  Forehead  thence proceed in  Summer Weather  to their  Naked Feet  but if the time be  cold  and  rigid  'tis enough to make  an Outward Motion  and the  Will  is taken for the Duty of the Action  The several Hours where∣in the  Turks  are Oblig'd to Pray  NEXT come their  Prayers  and those at  least Five  times a Day the  OverZealous  Bigots to their fals belief pray always  Seven  but the com∣mon times Injoyn'd by  Mahomet  are Just before  SunRising  Just at  Noon  Betwixt  NoonDay  and  Setting of the Sun  Exactly at  SunSett  And last of all Two Hours after  Their Forms of Prayer by whom In∣vented  THEIR Forms of Prayer consist of Sentences Collected  here  and  there  from several Chapters of the  Alcoran  some  few  whereof were left by  Mahomet  but  many more  Compil'd by his Successors  Ebubeker Omar Osmyn  and  Hali  and most Men  now  of good Capacities Compose their  Prayers  according to the Pressures of their several Occasions They Praise  therein  the  Mercy Bounty  and  Divine Omnipotence  of the Almighty Author of our Earthly beings Petition  Heaven  for the constant Welfare of their  Sultan  and his  Empire  and Conclude  Inhumanely  with Numerous  Curses  on the  Christian  World  THE Reader will be better able to perceive their manner by the fol∣lowing Copy of a  Janizaries  form of Prayer who was appointed by the  General  of that  Order  to be  one  amongst a constant  Guard  which kept the Gate belonging to the  British  Embassadour at  Constantinople  The Prayer of a  Turkish Ja∣nisary  IN God's great Name in God's great Name and in the Holy Name of  Ma∣homet  his  Mighty Good  and only Prophet God is  Great  my  God  is one I shall be  Happy  and  Successful  while I trust in him may my  Sword  be Broken and my  Head  become the  Drinking Cup  of  Infidels  when I forget his Glory let my  Prince  live long and Flourish like the  Cypress  let my  Order  be Ʋn∣numbred as the sands of the Sea shore that we may well defend him and let his Lands become as large and Ʋnresisted as the Boundless  Ocean  Let the Cursed Infidels be Damn'd for Ever since they dare  O Mahomet  Oppose thy Precepts let the Meanest Slave within the Territories of my Dread Sovereign put his Foot before 'tis Wash'd upon the Neck of that Proud King amongst their People who once Blasphemes the Holy  Prophet  let the Infidel I Guard be Safe whil'st under my Protection but let all others Perish Quickly or Enlarge the Bounds of thy Reli∣gion God is  Great God  is  One  and  Mahomet  his only  Prophet  Their postures when they Pray  WHEN they resolve to Pray in any  Mosque  they leave their Slippers at the Entrance of the Place when they Pray they turn their Faces to the  East  because their  Prophet  lies Entomb'd that way then standing for some time  Ʋpright  and  Silent  with their Arms a  Cross  in serious Contemplation on the Duty they are Summon'd to they  Elevate  their Eyes and Mutter to themselves some Pious Sentence after which they sit down  Cross Leg'd  with their Hands before 'em and repeating Slowly several short Ejacu∣lations at the  End  of  Each  bend forward to the Earth and Touch it with their Foreheads some will Kiss the Ground in pure Acknowledgement of their Submissive Natures this they do for several Minutes looking  now and then  behind 'em over  Either  Shoulder for they think their  Prophet  when he comes will suddenly appear behind some  Mussulman  devoutly Praying  Their fix'd Attention in the Act of Prayer  THEY Pray with Fervour and a fix'd Attention never turning like too many Inconsiderate  Christians  in our Noisy Churches to behold what People pass behind them all is  still  and  softly  Sacred no Man mutters Prayers of Course and Gapes the while to see about him how his Neigh∣bours Cloaths are Fashion'd no loud Indecent Whispers Interrupt Devoti∣on to inform some busie  Irreligious  Asker who Addresses such a Lady and how much such a Woman brought her Husband no  Opening  Pews and  Shutting  them again disturb the Congregation with their needless Cla∣mour no  HolyTalking  and  Conceited  Hypocrite outruns the  Parson  with  her zealous Lips while her lew'd  Eyes  behind a Fan are laughing heartily at some poor Jest her Ears have listen'd to no turn'dup Eyelids seem to speak her Thoughts on Heaven while a  Wrymouth  or Scornful turn of her  affected  Nostrils declare her Observation running o'er the  Faults  or  ill Con∣trivance  of her Neighbours Pettycoat A  Turkish Mosque  is free from Noise and all within it so  sedately  bent on what they do that 'tis a matter of suf∣ficient Wonder to behold so many met together in so deep a Stillness  A pious Nice∣ty  And indeed so very Sacred do the  Turks  esteem the Act of Prayer that if the casual Sting of some small  Gnat  the scratching of their Heads or any other common Accident but chance to interrupt them they  begin  again tho' almost  ended  thinking such prevented  Prayers  of no  Effect  or  Virtue  whatsoever but  neglected  as unworthy the Great Ear of Heaven  Preaching how practis'd in  Turkey  A  small  and  unadorn'd  erected Pillar bears a Case not much unlike a Pulpit whence the Priests sometimes direct a  monitory  Sermon to the listning Congre∣gation consisting  generally  of  explanatory  Sentences on the Mysterious Chap∣ters of their  honour'd  Alcoran with proper  Applications  to the numerous  Audience  The Book is held in rev'rence to its  Author  almost even with the Reader's Eyes and certain  grave  religious Songs are  intermix'd  with their  Devotion  which being ended every Man begins to stroke his  Beard  and uttering  short  and  private  Praises to his  God  and Prophet takes his leave and goes away with an extraordinary Satisfaction  Beads how us'd among the  Turks  THEY use a sort of  Beads  not much unlike the  Rosarys  of  Roman Ca∣tholicks  but to an End extreamly different for whereas the  latter  make those  Trifles  guides of Devotion Men in  Turkey  only bear 'em in their Hands and tell 'em over while they want some other Exercise the Beads consisting generally of a scented Past agreeably perfuming all who touch them I mention these because some heedless  Travellers  observing them in common Use among the  Turks  mistook the Cause and never searching into their Design have confidently spread a  noted Falsehood  on the  fix'd  Authority of their  afform'd Experience  No business must excuse the  Turks  from Prayer  SUCH  Turks  as at the common Hours of  Prayer  are on the Road or so employ'd as not to find Convenience to attend the  Mosques  are still ob∣lig'd to execute that  Duty  nor are ever known to fail whatever business they are then about but pray  immediately  when the Hour  alarms  them in that very place they chance to stand on insomuch that when a  Janisary  whom you hire to guard you up and down the City hears the Notice which is giv'n 'em from their Steeples he will turn about  stand still  and beckon with his Hand to tell his  Charge  he must have Patience for a while when taking out his  Handkerchief  he spreads it on the Ground sits  cross∣leg'd  thereupon and says his Prayers tho' in the  open Market  which ha∣ving ended he leaps briskly up  Salutes  the Person whom he undertook to Convoy and renews his Journey with the  mild Expression  of  Ghell John∣num Ghell  or Come  Dear  follow me  The Creation of a  Turkish Yemaum  or Pa∣rish Priest  THE  Turks  are summon'd at the Hours of Prayer by the repeated Ac∣clamations of their  Yemaums  or Parish Priests a People Chosen to their Offices by the recommendatory Letters of their best Parishioners to the  Vizier Azem  if near the  Metropolitan  or  if in Places far Remote  to the  Bashaw  of the respective Provinces where such  Vacancies  may chance to hap∣pen by him they are Examin'd for the  Turks  admit of no such thing as Spiritual Authority and if found qualified to read the  Alcoran  and to have practis'd an  austere  and  rigid  Life they are confirm'd by Virtue of a  Sigil  in the sought Possession of a vacant Priesthood  How the  Turks  are call'd to Prayers  THESE call  as I have said above  the  Turks  to Prayers by mounting to the Steeple Tops of their high Mosques where straining to a vast De∣gree the shrillness of their Voice they oft repeat  that  God  is one and  Mahomet  his Prophet  by constant Practice of this ancient Custom some attain a great Perfection and stopping with their Fingers both their Ears will raise their Voices to so high a Pitch that it amazes Strangers when they hear them crying  Bells not al∣low'd in  Tur∣kish  Churches  BY this Contrivance they supply the want of Bells not tolerated in the  Turkish  Churches  The reason of their Prohibi∣tion  the Cause whereof some Travellers ascribe to an un∣willingness they have to follow any Custom of the  Christian  Countries which tho' they vow a disrespect to our  Religion  and our  Manners  is not altogether the prevailing Cause of their forbidding  Bells  throughout their Government But as the  Turks  are more inclin'd to groundless Su∣perstition than the  Christian  World there is an ancient Prophecy which having  long  foretold the Greatness of their Empire in the Downfall of the  Greeks  advises them to take a constant Care least by the tinkling of a Bell the Walls of  Constantinople  shou'd be betray'd again and the  undreamt∣of  Fall of that  Important  Place denote the Ruin of their whole Dominions The Words of this  fear'd  Prophecy  translated into English  run as follows  A  Turkish  Prophecy  The time shall come when Earthquakes shall confound  With  unresisted  Shocks a fertil Ground  When the wide Ocean shall be stain'd with Blood  And Bulwarks float on the  portentous  Flood  When Smoak and Fire shall joyn to form new Rods  And Mortals ravish Thunder from the Gods  Then shall the Courage by mean Swains possest  Lead the bold  East  to overrun the  West    The Pride of Conquest shall adorn the Field  And the  Tall Cross  to the bright  Crescent  yield  But e'er the  Growing Moon  her  Full  attains  Her  waning  Face shall see her Sons in Chains  In a black Hour a  fatal Bell  shall Ring  Sure Mark  of  swift Success  to a  new mounting  King  The meaning of the Pro∣phecy  THIS Prophecy they look upon as verify'd in the Destruction of the  Graecian  Empire about the time that  Gunpowder  and the Use of  Cannons  was invented the  Swains  who were to lead the  East  to overthrow the  West  were  successful Shepherds  who laid the first Foundation of their  present Empire  the  Cross  they look upon to signifie the Empire of the  Greeks  al∣luding to the Banner of  Constantine the Great  the  waning  of the Moon be∣fore her  Full  they say denotes the Ruin of the  Ottoman  Family before they have obtain'd their Wish of Universal Monarchy and their Inter∣pretation of the  Bell  I have just now given you  The Dress of the  Yemaums  how differing from the rest  NOW tho' these Parish Priests are reckon'd while they hold the Pla∣ces they obtain amongst the Number of the  Turkish  Clergy yet are they no ways differently drest so much as to distinguish them from  Laymen  but in the folding up their Turbant which they wear a little larger than the rest they seldom  Preach  or venture to expound  in Great Assemblies  the mysterious Points of their Religion but content themselves with leading People into Mosques and the Inferior Businesses before related and if their Posts are taken from them they remain no more as Members of the Priesthood but betake themselves  at pleasure  to such different Em∣ployments amongst the  Laity  as their several Educations may have quali∣fied 'em for the Practice of  The  Sohoigs  or Preachers of the  Turks  THE Common Preachers in the  Turkish  Churches are the  Sohoigs  a sort of Men Politely Bred of Eminent Perfection both in Mind and Body vers'd  Gentelely  in a more than common knowledge of the  liberal Arts  and  Sciences  and sedate Professors of the rules of Moderation these are most respected by the  Turks  and  Christians  and are really so Accomplish'd in external Carriage and the  Ʋnfeign'd  Practice of an Inward Piety that 'tis not common to behold their Fellows even in the most  Refin'd  and  Po∣lish'd  parts of  Wellbred  Christendom  The  Muftee  THE Head of their Religion is the  Muftee  an Officer of the highest Dignity as to the  respect  which all Men show him but not extreamly Powerfull in that he is rather look'd upon as an  undoubted Oracle  in Cases of Dispute in Justice or Divinity than as Possessor of a large and Personal Authority  How Created his Salary and Perquisites  He is Created by the  Sultan  's Choice who puts him on a Rich and Splendid Vest of Sables and confers upon him  as his Places  's  due  the Yearly Salary of about two Thousand Pounds which by the Sale of certain  Benefices in his Gift  belonging to the  Royal Mosques  of  Constantinople  and the frequent Presents he Receives from  Foreign Ministers  and those of  Tur∣key  is Improv'd to times as much again  The  Emirs  or Kindred of  Mahomet  how respected  I may set down amongst the Orders of the  Turks Religious  the  Emirs  or Branches of their Prophets Family These are so highly Valued by all sorts of People that 'tis present Death to lift an Hand against their Per∣sons They are Independent on the common Government and Subject to some  Grave  and  Ancient  Member of their own Fraternity They Wear a sort of Turbant High and Stately in Bulk not much Inferiour to a  British  Bushel Its Colour is and must be  Green  for that alone Distinguishes their Lineage and is Worn because it was the Colour of their Prophet's  Standard  which a Member of their  Brotherhood  must always Carry to the War when the  Grand Signior  does appear himself in Field  The  Turkish  Funds for Maintenance of their Cler∣gy  IN order to maintain their Stately  Mosques  and Endless Numbers of the Preists about 'em above one Third of all the Lands within their Em∣pire are appointed for the Raising Sums of Money to defray the Charges of  Religious  Establishments and such Prodigious Gifts are daily added to the  Settled Income  of the Lands Appropriated for the use of all their  Royal  and  Inferiour  Churches  The Yearly Revenue of  Santa Sophia  that the  fix'd Revenue  of that Famous  Mosque  distinguish'd by the Ancient Name of  Santa Sophia  does Amount to near one Hundred Thousand Pounds  per  Annum  Their  Preists  Subservient to the civil Magistrates  THE Priests of  Turkey  are not  as in Christendom  subservient to the higher Power of Superiour Clergy but every Man dependant wholly on the Civil Magistrates of his  respective Parish  so that having no dispute up∣on the several Priviledges of  Spiritual  and  Temporal  Authority they mingle mildly in a joint Obedience the Clergy showing due respect to the  Ʋnbridled Laity  and the latter giving daily Proofs of a  Profound  and Decent Veneration to the Office of the former which they show sufficiently in that  respectfull Style  wherewith they  commonly  Address them  How the  Turks  Address their Clergy  TO you the  Rich  and  Valued Mines  of  Eloquence  and  Wisdom  bright Directors to the Paths of  God  belov'd of  Heaven  and Children of the Prophet the Glories of Religion and Illustrious Pillars of  Unbyass'd  Justice may your Judgment be  Encreas'd  and joys be  Doubled  c  The  Turkish Ramazaan  or Yearly Fast of thirty days  I now proceed to an Account of the beforenam'd  third Injunction  of their Prophet to the Followers of his Doctrine and that is  to observe a Fast one Month in twelve  This Fast they call the  Ramazann  and keep it by the different Courses of the Moon always falling  sooner  out each Year than  other change the Season with the Month they Fast in and oblige 'em  once in Thirty Years  to Fast each Day of every season  Their manner of observing it  THEY keep this Fast by  strict unbroken Abstinence  from the first ap∣pearance of the Morning Sun till after  Sunsett  in which  Religious  time 'tis Death to  Eat  or  Drink  or  Smoak Tobacco  but when the Lights appear upon the Steeples of their  Mosques  they lay aside Sobriety and bringing out the Dainties  purposely reserv'd  begin to revel in a loud Extravagance turn  Fast  to  Feasting Night  to  Day  and Dallying with their Women  Loose  and  Wanton  spend their their Hours in Mirth and Jollity till some shrill Cock invites their Sleep by loudly telling them the First appearance of unwelcome Morning  Travellers and the Sick a little fa∣vour'd  HOWEVER  Travellers  or  Persons Indispos'd  may break the Fast of  Ramazann  provided when recover'd from their Sickness or arriv'd in Safety at their Journies end they Fast as many Days together as they then omitted doing it  The strictness of the Duty  SO strictly do they keep this  Celebrated  Fast that  in their Noted Cities  Officers are sent about from Place to Place to make their Observations on the Peoples Actions and it has been known that some of their most active  Sultans  have rode  Incognito  about the Streets attended at a distance by observant Executioners who at the smallest Beckon of their Masters Fin∣ger were in constant readiness to  Strangle  or  Behead  whatever Persons he had found  in Actual Disobedience  to the rules of their Religion  The Feast of  Bairamm  and manner of its Celebration  IMMEDIATELY subsequent to the  Ramazann  is that  short Three Days Feast  they call  Bairamm  not much unlike our  Easter  They have  two  of these each Year the  First  is Introduc'd by the appearance of the first new Moon that closes up the  Fast  and is Proclaim'd by the discharge of all the  Cannon  round the  Sultan  's Palace and the  Airy  notes of  Sprightly Musick  sounding loud from every Corner the  Second  is about Threescore and Ten Days further in the Year This Feast is kept with universal Mirth and all the Sports which  Turkish  Gravity permits the Practice of and at this time they visit one another with a nice formality observing from the  Courtier  to the  meanest Peasant  certain  Punctual  and  Establish'd  forms of Salutation not inferiour to the polish'd  complaisance  of  Christian  Palaces  Zacatt  or giv∣ing  Alms  how order'd by their Doct∣rine  AND now I come to treat of their  Zacatt  or Fourth Injunction of their  Prophet  which is nothing else but  giving Alms  according to the Plenty  God  has blest 'em with They are prescrib'd the several rules of this  commanded Charity  in Books the ancient Doctors of their Law have left behind 'em The  Standard  rule is to bestow  one Penny in an Hundred  of their utmost substance on the Publick Funds for  Building Hospitals  maintaining  Poor  and  Aged  People erecting  Hans  or Inns upon the Road where  Pilgrims  find  freecost  a Threedays Entertainment or for any o∣ther publick good which shall be thought convenient  The different Principles of the  Turks  dis∣cover'd in their Charity  this is the lowest they shou'd give but some are found whose  sordid base  and  avaritious  Principles incline them meanly to  deny  their  Wealth  that they may save a  Poor  and  Inconsiderable  Portion from the uses they shou'd give it to and others have been known who  generously  prizing  transient  Riches at their proper Worth refuse to hide one  number'd  Penny but  on the Contrary  bestow the  Fourth  or  Third  of all their substance on the  needy objects  of a  pity'd Poverty  The Pilgri∣mage to  Mec∣cha  FIFTHLY  The Annual Pilgrimage to  Meccha is enjoyn'd the  Turks  who must from every Part of their wide Empire  once at least before they  die  perform that Journey as a  Typical Expression  of their Passage from this World to that hereafter Many Thousands  Yearly  undertake this  celebrated Pilgrimage    Referr'd to the th Chapter  but as there is a large Account of all the  Ceremonies  of that  respected  Duty in another Part of this Book I shall say no more in this Place but will referr my Reader for his further Satisfaction to the Eight and Fortieth Chapter treating fully of some strange Particulars  Friday  the  Tur∣kish  Sabbaoth  FRIDAY  as I said before is set apart by the  Mahometans  for their Day of Rest or  Sabbaoth  which they keep  religiously  till the Duties of the  Mosques  are fully ended  Their Punish∣ment for breaking it  and if  in time of their Divine Service  a  Turk  pre∣sumes to open Shop they  nail his Ears  directly to his Counter and expose him to the Scoffs of Publick Scorn as one who merits not the Name of  Mussulman  The  Dervee∣shes  who they are  THEY have a sort of Priests amongst 'em call'd  Derveeshes  who on these Days harrangue the People in the open  Mosques  and turn themselves about in  frantick Postures  to the  noisy sound  of certain Instruments of Mu∣sick till giddy by the frequent Rounds they make they fall upon the Ground and lying for a while  without the smallest Motion  rise at last  with elevated Eyes  and  Arms extended  telling with a  grave  and  artificial  Look their gaping Audience that while entranc'd as they beheld they have been taken into Heaven and convers'd with Angels in the Fields of Glory  The Cheats they put upon the People in their  Mosques  and so proceed while shelter'd by the Cloak of  deep Hypocrisy  to tell the People what their own Desires wou'd have perform'd under the prevailing Notion that they are all the while pronouncing Sacredly the Will of Heaven  The Tempe∣rance and Longaevity of the  Derveeshes  THESE Priests are most  abstemious  in their Diet and  austere  in Hu∣mour rarely speaking but in  Mosques  and never drinking Wine or any other Liquor than the Fountain Water whereby secure from those Di∣stempers which the ill Effects of  Gluttony  and  Drunkenness  make common to  luxurious  and  intemperate  Appetites they  generally  live to a prodigious Age and serve to prove by undeniable Experience the inconsiderate Follies of such Rich Men as hurry headlong to their Graves by lewd Extrava∣gancies and the constant Practice of a loose Debauchery on which the following Verses in  Lucan  's  Pharsalià  are a very eloquent and nice Re∣flection  O prodiga rerum  Luxuries nunquam parvo contenta paratu  Et quaesitorum terrá pelagoque ciborum  Ambitiosa fames lautae gloria mensae  Discite quam parvo liceat producere vitam  Et quantum Natura petat Non erigit aegros  Nobilis ignoto Diffusus Consule

Life may be preserv'd  And how much  Nature  asks Ill is he serv'd  Who strives by  strong oldWine  his Health to raise  Prest in some  ancient King  's forgotten Days  The  hearty Poor  the  wholesome  Country  Swain  Drinks not in  Gold  nor does for  Myrrh  complain  Bread  and the  murm'ring Current  of some  Mead  Supply his  largest Wants  nor does he  Dainties  need  AND indeed it is a very common thing to see in many of those Countries subject to the  Turks  both Men and Women of  amazing Ages  A very odd Discovery of a Man in  Bul∣garia  who had liv'd to be Years old  Once I travell'd through  Bulgaria  and  Valachia  into  Germany  from  Adrianople  with the Right Honourable the  Lord Paget  then returning from his Ten Years Embassy in the  Turkish  Court we pitch'd our Tents about a Fur∣long from a small and inconsiderable Village through whose midst a  smooth  and  pleasant  River gently glided  natural Curiosity  and the  coolness of the Day  invited me to take a  melancholy  Walk along the  green  and  solitary  Banks of the delightful Current where I was surpriz'd to find a very  old  and  graceful  Man lie stretch'd upon the Grass and humming to himself the  merry remnant  of a  Turkish  Song  I view'd attentively the  wrinkled  Visage of this ancient Man who seem'd to have been  buried  and return'd to Earth with all the Furrows of  destru∣ctive Time  engrav'd upon his Forehead But while I wondred at the  brisk∣ness  of his Voice he doubled my Amazement by his leaping up with such agility of Body as became the Strength of one in all the Vigour of accomplish'd Manhood  A cringing Method of Salutation us'd in  Turkey  he came towards me bowing with a servile Air peculiar to the slavish Nature of that conquer'd Nation and endeavour'd to Salute me  with a strange Humility  by the kissing of my Vest a  cringing  Custom us'd in  Turkey  and only proper for the sordid Practice of a  base submissive  and  inglorious  People  I prevented his Design and pleas'd to see the odd Appearance which he made desir'd him to follow me to  yonder Camp  and I wou'd treat him with a glass of Wine  A strange In∣stance of Mirth in old Age  he seem'd transported when he saw the Tents and running on before me a considerable way with aukward steps as if he aim'd at something like a Dance he threw his Arms and Feet about him at a merry rate and with a very  brisk  and  laughing  Countenance repeated in a sort of  tuneless  Ballad several Verses to the following purpose  Wine  makes  old  Men  young  again  Ay marry and  Women  too  Wine  cures  Sorrow  takes off  Pain  And former Joys can soon renew  The odd Ac∣count he gave of himself  I brought him to the Camp where having eat roast Beef and drank a∣bove a Quart of  strong red Wine  we ask'd him  Where he liv'd How old he was  and many other such like Questions He return'd  for  Answer that he knew no more than that he was about thirty Years of Age when the Village where he liv'd was burn'd to Ashes that his Children's Children  he thank'd God  were dead and he had nothing left upon his Care but his  old brisk  and  honest  Person and so began to  sing  and  dance  again as he had done before  BY this time several of the Country People who came out to look up∣on the  Tents  where gather'd round him and inform'd us that his Family had liv'd above two hundred Years as  Farmers  in that Neighbourhood that he had long outliv'd the  period  of his Race  extinct  near fourteen Years be∣fore by the death of two of his Great Grandsons Men fullgrown that he was now maintain'd by charitable Contributions of the Houses in the Village and that he was by  punctual Calculation  from the burning of the Place computed  then arriv'd  at the surprizing Age of one hundred sixty and two Years  Teeth three times chang'd  HE cou'd eat the  toughest Meat  without the  smallest trouble  leap about without a Staff and having chang'd his Teeth three several times the Set he had were wholly sound and white as Ivory Nor was he  then  in seeming danger of approaching Death but may perhaps be now alive as healthful and untouch'd by those Infirmities peculiar to Old Age as when he was an Infant  CHAP VIII Of the several Sects into which they are Divided  Frequent Changes in Religion a certain Proof of humane Imperfection  AMONGST the num'rous Imperfections which attend Mortali∣ty there is none can better serve to prove the  Frailties  of our  human Nature  than that  diffusive Levity  which does so often change the Notions of Mankind in matters of  Religion To Day  we strongly fix our Resolutions to defend the Creed we  now profess  with Lives and Fortunes  nay  so warmly struggle to promote its Doctrine that we scarce avoid the Guilt of  Persecution  to enlarge its Limits yet  to Morrow  shakes the Pillars of our Faith and leads us headlong to a blind Ex∣travagance in joyning vigorously  with some new Sect  to undermine clan∣destinely the mock'd Foundations of our forsaken Church and on  Her  Ruins raise the Columns of some  New Opinion  and prevailing Heresy  Interest the common Cause of new Opinions  AND if we guide our Judgment by a  contemplative  View of those great Turns to which the  Ancient  or the  Modern  Changes in Religion ow'd their  Introduction  the pricks of Conscience will be rarely found the  real Causes  of those  numerous Innovations  perswasive Interest is still the Motive that excites our Actions to our own Advantage Man is  naturally prone  to love himself and will embrace such Tenets as do best agree with his  de∣sir'd Conveniency  or sooth most favorably the gross accomplishment of his  licentious Inclinations  and when the  tempting Call  of such a Doctrine sum∣mons his  Adherence  Nature urges him to quit a Faith  more rigid and severe  and make himself a Member of such new Profession as enlarges him to pra∣ctise  free from Censure  the unbounded Pleasures of a welcome Liberty  Men are natu∣rally led to quit the wea∣kest Party  THUS every Age produces  new  and  various Heresies  nor can the meanest Doctrine want its Proselytes if vented at a time when  Foreign Wars  or  Civil Discords  shake the Pillars of  that  Faith it must oppose for Men of small and undiscerning Judgments will be proud of owning  in its shining Grandeur  a Religion they will quit with  scorn  and  indignation  when too weak to grant its  persecuted  Sons a  claim'd  Protection And as a  palliating  Excuse for their  abhorr'd Apostacy  can only say with  Ovid  Tempora mutantur Nos mutamur in illis  The  Times  are chang'd and  we  are chang'd with  Time  The means whereby  Ma∣hometanism  gaind Success  'TWAS by these means  Mahometanism  invading  Asia  at a time when  Wars  and  Tumults Schisms  and  Heresy  and all the Plagues of fatal Discord  rent the Kingdoms of the  Christian World  with dire Divisions met a  Swift  and  strange Success  perhaps beyond the very  hopes  or  wishes  of the Black Impostor  The cause of the Variety of Sects among the  Turks  BUT as all Men let them change as much as possible their  Natures  and  Religion  must  notwithstanding  still retain  some Scatter'd Notions  of their for∣mer Customs and perhaps a sort of  native Fondness  for their ancient Practices so the Prodigious Body of the  Turkish  Church promiscuously receiving  different Nations  to compose its Grandeur is thereby Divided into full as many Sects and  different opinions  as a mixt confusion of  Mahometanism  in its own Divisions with the broken Remnants of so many Hundred se∣veral sorts of Worship cou'd produce amongst them  Above an Hundred dif∣ferent Opini∣ons now pro∣fess'd in  Tur∣key  THERE are at present near an Hundred  noted Sects  among the  Turks  who disagree in very wide Contrarieties of opinion and many more whose  unsupported Follies  sinking Daily by their want of Learning to defend their Tenets are not worth  a Stranger's observation  nor esteem'd enough considerable by the  Turks  themselves to claim a Place in their Reli∣gious Lists  TO treat  Distinctly  of the various Sects that now divide them wou'd require more Room than can be spar'd from matters  more Material  and  Diverting  and afford the Reader  small delight  and  less Improvement  I will therefore mention but the Heads of some  prevailing Tenets  and proceed to what will entertain  the Curious  with a  more uncommon  and  agreeable Amusement  A sort of  Turks  who own our Saviour for the Son of God  AND first in due respect to the  eternal  Glories and Immense com∣passion of  our blessed Saviour  I must  with zealous wishes for the great Im∣provement of a happy Prospect  mention an opinion  long since form'd  in se∣veral Parts of the  Grand Signior  's Country and  of late  encreas'd to such a strength that  Thousands  of his Subjects openly avow it in despite of danger  The Tenets of the Sect a∣bovementi∣on'd  THE  Professors  of the Doctrine Taught by this opinion are  distin∣guish'd  by the Name of  ChoopMassiahee  or  Dreamers of Messiah  These de∣clare  that Christ was God is now in Heaven and shall come to Judgment far superior to their Prophet or his followers  To prove the truth of this  oppos'd  As∣sertion they produce the words of  Mahomet himself  by a  Quotation  from their  Alcoran  where it is said  thine Eyes  O Mahomet  shall see thy Lord return in Glory  They are generally Men of clear Capacities and  exquisite Dexterity  in management of Business and by the sacred notions they retain of the Divinity of  JESƲS  appear  not widely separated  from the Pale of his  Religion  Some have gone so far in their  enlighten'd  preference of  CHRIST  to  MAHOMET  that they have fallen  Martyrs  to an  unripe Faith  and  even in Death  maintain'd their Principles  The Barba∣rous and In∣humane Do∣ctrine of the  Morgee  ANOTHER Sect Intituled  Morgee  hold with obstinacy that all the followers of true  Mahometanism  must  necessarily  attain the most sublime and heightned joys of their transporting Paradise tho'  while on Earth  they liv'd in endless Wickedness but on the contrary affirm that any who deny  their Prophet  tho' they have led a  Sober Vertuous truely Exemplary and Ʋnspot∣ted Life  will find it yet Impossible to be admitted into  Heaven  or  indeed  to save their Souls from tedious Scenes of Future Punishment  The  Chawar∣gee  THE  Chawargee  maintain it an absurd and false Conclusion to assert that ever God bestow'd on Man the Gift of Prophecy or thought it necessary to inspire  with boasted Knowledge  or  Infalibillity  the blest Ca∣pacity  of any chosen or distinguish'd Mortal  They deny the Propheti∣cal Inspirati∣on of  Maho∣met  these allow no more to  Ma∣homet  than that he was a Man whom  Nature  had endow'd with great Ac∣complishments and God afforded an  enlarg'd peculiar  and  uncommon  Porti∣on of his  holy Spirit  in regard to his  unequal'd Zeal  and unaffected Piety  The  Sephatee  THE  Sephatee  affirm that God Possesses endless Attributes of  Power Life Wisdom Truth  and  Justice  but extend their Notions to such  wild extravagance  as to conceive his  Senses  built upon the same  corporeal Organs  which compose the  Fabrick  of our humane Bodies they think he  hears smells sees feels tastes  and  understands  as we do here differing from  Mor∣tals  only  thus  that whereas  our  Bodies are both  weak  and  finite God  has fram'd  himself  a Being  strong  and  infinite  This Notion they  defend or strive to do it  from those several Passages of  holy Scripture  where the  figurative  Sense of the Expression speaks of  God  's creating  Eve  from  Adam  's  Rib  as by the virtue of a manual Operation  his sitting on a Throne repenting often what he had decreed  as of the Actions of a  humane Body  The grossness of their Ap∣prehension  They will not be disswaded from conceiving those  Expressions  in a  literal Sense  and being  for the most part  Men of  gross  and  vulgar  Apprehensions ascend not to the height of  sacred Contemplation  on the  mysterious  Attributes of the  AllGreat Incomprehensible  A Sect among themselves divided into one and Thir∣ty different Opinions  WONDERFULLY  various  and strangely  contradictory  to their own Assertions are the Notions form'd of the  Divine Omnipotence  by the  MuhawTazlee  a Sect divided into  one and thirty  several Interpretations of that  controverted  Tenet which divides them from the rest And that is  GOD is Holy and Eternal by the Virtue of his Essence yet refuse to own him eternal by his Eternity knowing by his Knowledge or merciful by his Mercy  Their surprizing Caution and fantastic Notion of  Almighty God  proceeds from their aversion to the Doctrine of a  Trinity  so that to avoid a  multi∣plication  of the Divine Power they run themselves to  strange abstruse  and  in∣coherent Dreams  of something which they  wou'd conceive  but  cannot  A Sect who wait the com∣ing of another Prophet  ANOTHER Sect call'd  Zeidee  believe that long before the World shall end a  Persian Prophet  shall be sent by  God  to  disannul  the Laws of  Mahomet  and teach a  new  and  surer  way to Joys hereafter  A Blasphe∣mous Opini∣on  JABHAIAH  are a sort of People who affirm  that God created Man the World and all his Labours by meer chance and accident  denying his  Om∣niscience  and believing that he improves  like Men  by  Practice  and  Ex∣perience  Two Sects di∣rectly oppo∣site  MAALƲMGEE  and  MeizhaChullha  are  Sects  directly opposite to one another the first affirming  GOD is to be known on Earth by the knowledge of our selves  and the last maintaining it  impossible either in the present World or that to come to know him otherwise than by a faint perception of his Rays of Glory  A stoical and melan∣choly sort of People  KAADEZADEELI are a stoical and melancholy Sect who practise strange and superstitious Ceremonies in praying for the Dead  These Men profess a natural aversion to the sound of  Musick  and neglect with  rigid  and  austere disdain  the chearful use of  Mirth  and  Pleasure  they sit whole Days and Nights  alone still bending forwards  and repeating with a  doleful  and  despon∣ding  Accent the  respected  Name of the supreme Almighty  Idolaters a∣mong the  Turks  THERE is a certain Sect call'd  Sabbin  tending strongly to adore  Idolatrously  the  Sun  and  Moon  from the  conspicuous Influences  they are found to have on Things below  A Sect among the  Turks  who allow the Trinity  ANOTHER sort of Men call'd  Escrakee  allow the  Trinity  as a Number springing from the  Ʋnity of God  This Sect are blest with a Pla∣tonic Contemplation on the great  Idea  of divine Omnipotence and discer∣ning plainly all the  gross  and  sordid  Falsehoods of the  Turkish Alcoran  reject the Notions built upon its  Fabrick  and support their Arguments upon the surer Principles of humane  Reason  A sort of Men Professors of an exemplary Modesty  THE  Hairhetwee  diffide so much in natures Strength and humane Understanding that they think it  Sin  to contradict the  weakest Argument  prefer'd against them affirming that our  frail Capacities  can never repre∣sent a  true Idea  of a Being so superior to us These Men behave themselves with an  accomplish'd Modesty  give no offence to  Man  or  Beast  but when a  Question  is propos'd for their  desir'd Solution  return this Answer  Allah Belerr ammah Ben Yoketer  God knows all but I am Ignorant  A Sect who hold the Trans∣migration of Souls  BUT more  diverting  and  extraordinary  will appear the  Munasahee  or  Py∣thagorical  Opinion which maintains with violence the old  Metempsychosis  or the  Transmigration of our humane Souls  To this Assertion are inclin'd the ablest  Physicians  of the  Turkish Empire  and it is a matter worth the Rea∣ders Patience to reflect a little on the oddness of their Notions  as to this particular  THEY hold that when a Man departs this Life his Soul shall enter  in that very Moment  the  appointed Body  of some certain Beast whose Nature did in  Life  the most resemble the  prevailing Genius  of the late deceas'd thus for example the  undaunted Soul  of some  brave Warrior  shall be sent to animate the  Lyon  the  Coward's Soul  shall dwell at rest within the  Hare  the  Generous  shall possess the  Horses Body  and the  Goat  contain the Soul of the  Lascivious  The Camel much respe∣cted among the  Turks  But  as a Blessing most desir'd  and the sublimest  Happiness  they can attain  in Death  the  pious grave religious  and  contented Man  shall see his Soul inform the  Camel  a  Beast  of every other most respected by the fond  Mahometans  A very strange Opi∣nion  THUS  cas'd  and  fetter'd  shall the Souls of  Mortals  wander in the course of a  refining Pilgrimage  for the full space of  three thousand and five hundred Years  still growing  more and more  polite and glorious till the longest Date of their  injoin'd Peregrination  once expir'd they return again to some bright Part of  undiscover'd Earth  where free from those  unnumber'd  and  insulting  Imperfections which attend Mortality  in its impure and unrefin'd Existence  they shall enjoy the choicest of such  unimagin'd Blessings  as will fit them  joyfully  for that  more bright Reception  they expect to meet in the transpor∣ting Mansions of a  future Glory  THERE is a Story which a very  grave  and  seemingly religious Turk  wou'd often tell me with  repeated Vows  and  serious Protestations  of the truth of his Assertion He was a strict Adherer to the Doctrine of  Transmigration  and gave the following account of a  surprizing Accident  which had oblig'd him to embrace the Articles of that  till then despis'd Opinion  A strange Re∣lation of a  Turk  's Con∣version to the Doctrine a∣bovementi∣on'd  I was  said he  about my one and twentieth Year of Age a violent op∣poser of the Tenets of  Munasahee  or such as hold the Pilgrimage of Souls  for so 'tis call'd among the  Turks and often us'd to laugh at the Opinion of  an elder Brother  who delighted much in running Races and was won∣derfully  swift of Foot  on which account he often us'd to fansie that  after Death  his Soul wou'd animate some  Horse  or  Antelope  He dy'd and left me very sorrowful for he deserv'd my  love  by  frequent kindnesses  and triumph'd in  a more than common share  of my sincere Affection I of∣ten hunted in the neighb'ring Woods and took a great delight in all the  Practices of  Rural Pastime  when on a certain Day  with several of my Acquaintance  riding out to seek some Sport we rows'd a  Stagg  of stately Size and spreading Antlers  Strange Acti∣on of a Beast directly con∣trary to his Nature  THE  Beast  no sooner saw the  Dogs  about him and beheld the Com∣pany prepar'd for his Destruction but instead of flying from  impending  Danger he came running swiftly  towards my Horse  as if he aim'd to overthrow me with his fury  A very odd Passage  SURPRIZ'D at the  advance  I saw him making I prepar'd as well as possible for  Selfdefence  and  poizing  in my hand  a pointed Javelin  I carried with me was about directing it to wound his Breast when  O amazing Prodigy  I saw the Dogs begin to  tremble  and  instead of tearing his unhappy Limbs  lie down and fawn  with lolling Tongues  upon the panting Animal who with a timorous hast  as sadly apprehensive of the threatning Weapon  rear'd himself upright upon his hinder Feet and  with his two fore Legs  and the  expressive  motions of his  Head  and  Eyes  made melancholy signs of some  important Secret  which his want of Speech deny'd an  utterance  A  Turk  disco∣vers his Bro∣ther's Soul in the Body of a Stagg  METHOUGHTS the very moment when this  moving  posture of the  Stagg  was pleading for compassion I perceiv'd  a sudden cold  strike thro' my Body and imagin'd  I distinctly  heard a  murmuring Whisper  speak these Words as  softly  and  serene  as if some gentle breath of Wind had fann'd my Temples  Pity O unthinking Man thy Brother's Soul to whose appointed wand'rings the intended Death of this poor Stagg shall add twelve Years of tedious Pilgrimage  ASTONISH'D at the strange and unexpected Accident I drop'd my  Javelin  from my trembling hand and scarce preserv'd my self from sinking off my Horse by the  industrious  Favours of my Friends Assistance But while they were busy in endeavouring to recover me again the  Stagg  was gone nor did one  Dog  attempt to follow him  AND now  continued he  you will not wonder that I hold the Do∣ctrine you so much oppose for  certain Truth  and  undeniable Reality  my Brother's Soul  by this strange Accident  converted me and may the Will of  God  direct some Chance to lead your Judgment  first  to see the light of  Mahomet and then  the certainty of this  sure Faith  the  Tenet  of his Follower  EXCUSE me  Reader  that I have so long detain'd you on so  whimsical  a Subject nor believe you see  this Story here inserted  from a fond effect of my  Credulity  I tell it to divert you with the  Turk  's Opinion who had fram'd  hereon  a fix'd belief of  Transmigration  and imagin'd  by the whisper which he dream'd he heard  that  such departed Souls  as dwelt within a  Beast  that hap∣ned to be  kill'd  or die  by accident  before its time shall lose entirely all those Years they had remain'd inclos'd  before such accident  and be oblig'd to  wander so much longer  thro' the  various Stages  of their tedious Jour∣ney  Monasteries among the  Turks  by whom Or∣dain'd  MONASTERIES or a sort of  Cloisters  for religious  Turks  of se∣veral Orders were  anciently  ordain'd  by Mahomet's Decree  in imitation of the  Convents  famous  then  for  exemplary Piety  and  great Oeconomy  by the religious Practices of  Solitude  and  Sanctity  among the  Christians  Muveh lehvee  an Order of  Turkish  Monks  OF these are held in most esteem  Muvehlehvee  an Order  silent hum∣ble modest  and professing  Charity  they wear the coursest Dress that can  be possibly invented and renounce the  World  with all its Glories fasting  every Thursday  round the Year besides the  Ramazann  or  publick  Ceremo∣ny and neglecting piously all  earthly Pleasures  for the  preferable  Blessings of a  future Paradise  These Monks the most ac∣complish'd Spies of  Turkey  ICONIƲM  is the  favour'd  Residence of these religious Men  there  dwells the  Chief  or  Prior  of their  Order  and from thence they go  like Ro∣man Missionaries  up and down thro'  China Persia  and the wide Domini∣ons of the  Great Mogul  striving to convert to  Turkish  Superstition every Man they can  commodiously  fall in with and by travelling  without the least suspicion  into foreign Countries become the only  able Spies  of all the  Sul∣tan  's vast Dominions  Not much un∣like the  Capu∣chines  of  Rome  THERE is no Order  in the Romish Church  which does so nearly suit the  Manners Habit Humour  and  Deportment  of these  Turkish Fryars  as the  Capuchines  and  they  agree so  fully  and  exactly  in their several Customs that were it not for staining with the near Comparison a  Christian  Cha∣racter these  Eastern  Priests and  MonkMahometans  might  not improperly  be call'd the  Capuchines  of  Turkey  Nimtulahee  ANOTHER Order of the  Turkish  Priests they call  Nimtulahee  these have their Convents in the City of  Constantinople  weigh their Bread by  Drachms  and  Scruples  fast and pray  whole Days together  and avoid the Company of all Mankind They place no value on the Blessings of Morta∣lity making frequent use of this  grave Maxim  in their  common Conversa∣tion    Their pious Maxim  Riches are the vainest Trifles we can possibly collect since they so far possess our Thoughts that we forget one fatal Hour may take us from them  and  herein  they seem to steer the  prudent  Course of a  sincere  Morality believing the natural Frailty of our  humane  Bodies undeserving half the pains we take to pamper 'em and disregarding with a wise Disdain those  transitory Orna∣ments  and  fading Satisfactions  which must perish with the  Persons  of un∣thinking Mortals And here they act agreable to the Notions of the  admi∣rable Horace  in the  seventh Ode of his fourth Book  Hor L    Ode    Pulvis umbra sumus  Quis scit an adjiciant hodiernae crastina summae  Tempora Dii superi  Cuncta manus avidas fugient haeredis amico  Quae dederis animo  Cum semel occideris de te splendida  Minos  Fecerit arbitria  Non Torquate genus non te facundia non te  Restituet pietas  What are the Bodies Men so vainly boast  But  Dust  and  Ashes  and a  fleeting  Ghost  Who knows if Heav'n whose Pow'r  to day  we praise  Will add one short  to Morrow  to our Days  Vainly fond Mortal does thy Soul employ  Her  greedy Faculties  in search of Joy  For all those Blessings thou dost now prepare  Will fly the eager hopes of thy expecting Heir  When the  impartial  Stroke of  certain  Death  Shall ravish all thy  Glories  with thy  Breath    When the Great Judge of Heav'ns  unbounded  State  Has  sentenc'd thee  to some  eternal Fate  Alas my Friend where's  then  thy noble Blood  What will avail thee  there  thy  earthly Good  Vainly thy  Eloquence  will  there  implore  Nor can thy  pious Life  thy  finish'd Course  restore  Edheemi  a grave and so∣litary Order  ANOTHER Order of the  Turks Religious  call'd  Edheemi  live in  Woods Cells hollow Trees  and other lonely Places converse  familiarly  with  Lyons Tygers  and the wildest Beasts which haunt the Forest if we may believe the Members of their own  Fraternity  They have some  Convents  in the  Eastern  Parts of the  Grand Turks  Dominions but will rather choose to live  abroad  and taste the  free uninterrupted  Pleasures of a constant So∣litude  Santoons  a loose and frantic sort of People  SANTOON  's or HolyMen a sort of  frantic idle  and  conceited Beg∣gars  going  almost Naked  with their Bodies wounded deep in many Places are esteem'd among the  Turks  as  Sacred  and inspir'd by the  divine Illumina∣tion  These commit the worst extravagancies under the deceitful Cloak of  heavenly Raptures  and are allow'd the use of  Wine  and all  strong Li∣quors  to enable them the better to converse with  GOD  and view his  Glories  Fools and MadMen valued much among the  Turks  MADMEN and  Fools  are by  the Turks  esteem'd the Favorites of  Heaven  They think 'em taken  from their Tenements of Clay  to talk with  Angels  in the upper Regions and will therefore beg the blessing of an  Ideot  when they meet him in the Streets and bending forward  kiss his Garment  with the most  profound  and  humble  Veneration  Schism more prevalent in  Turkey  than in  Christendom  MANY other  Sects  and  Orders  are at present found  among the Turks  some of which assert Opinions in  diametrical  opposition to the  Tenets  of the others and divide the Doctrine they profess from  Mahomet  into such  in∣testine Jarrs  and  publick Disagreements  that the power of  Schism  in  Christian  Churches falls far short of that now found in every  Province  of the  Turkish  Empire  The Opinions of some dia∣metrically op∣posite to those of others  SOME profess  perpetual Chastity  and fearing  Nature  will incline 'em to forget  the tenour of their Vow  will make themselves  unable to commit such Sin  by the  preventive  virtue of a  selfCastration  others  Marry freely in their very Convents  and enjoy amidst the rigid Ceremonies of  religious Solitude  the loosest pleasures and  unbounded  freedom of allow'd Polygamy some again  must never Marry  but are made a full amends for that  restriction  by the li∣berty they have to hold a  free  and  undisputed  Conversation with as many  Concubines  as they find means to compass  One common Article in which they all agree  THUS they vary widely from each others Practice and only  join una∣nimously  in this One  common Article That 'tis their duty to oppose with Violence the Doctrine of  Christianity  hate kill and persecute  without compassion  all the Members of that  envied Faith  till they have rooted from the Earth the Name of  Jesus  and reduc'd the Nations of the conquer'd World to worship singly One Great  God  and  Mahomet  his Prophet  BUT the  neverfailing  Mercy of  our great Protector  who prevented  hi∣therto  their curst Designs has  graciously  been pleas'd to take away  all Cause of fear  from his  defended  Church whose  firm Foundation  he has plac'd upon a  Rock  nor shall the Gates of  Hell  prevail against it  CHAP IX Of the  Turkish  Studies and how far Learning is encourag'd among them  Learning dis∣countenanc'd in  Turkey  and the Reasons of it  LEARNING  as inconsistent with the nature of a Government whol∣ly founded on the Power of the Sword  receives but small encourage∣ment in any Part of the  Grand Signior  's Empire and as I have said  before  it is a  Maxim of his Policy  to bend the Minds of all his Sub∣jects to a constant Practice of the Art of War imagining that when a Man  relaxes  from the love of  Military Toils  to the more  soft bewitching Charms  of Books and Solitude he grows  unfit for Martial Labours  and becomes so deeply sunk in pleasing  Contemplations  on the Works of  Nature  that he loses  by degrees  that  active Vigour  which shou'd bravely recommend  a da∣ring Soldier  to the face of Danger  Learning a∣greeable to mild and gen∣tle Govern∣ments  ROME  the  ancient  and the  glorious  Mistress of the  kneeling World  has taught the  Turks  by sure Experience that  Learning  and the moral dictates of attain'd  Philosophy  agreeing  sympathetically  with the  noble honest  and  re∣ligious Forms  of milder  Governments  preserve a peaceful and  unshock'd Tran∣quility  for Men  thereby  will see the Blessings they enjoy in Liberty and know to prize their happy Freedom  Dangerous and fatal to an arbitrary Monarchy  But in  Governments Tyrannical  and  Arbitrary Learning like a Spurr to Horses of a fiery Nature  only serves to make 'em  feel  and  hate  their Servitude exciting  warm  and  dangerous  sparks of Courage in their Breasts whose sure Effects produce an  eager  and  undaun∣ted  Inclination to expose their  valued Lives  and  Fortunes  for redeeming  gloriously  the ravish'd Charms of  Liberty  and  Property  Rome  success∣ful in her pristine Igno∣rance  THUS while the  weak  and  dubious  Fate of  infant Rome  oblig'd her Sons to slight all Studies but the Art of War she triumph'd  nobly  in a vast Success and grew in  time  to such a pitch of Pride that she subdued the  Monarchs  of the  distant East  and rais'd Her Emperours to all the  Pow'r  that  arbitrary Rule  and  unresisted Tyranny  cou'd possibly afford them for the constant Practice of a  Military Toil  made Dangers  natural  to all her Peo∣ple who  allur'd by hopes of fresh Success  attempted freely any hazard like the Men of whom thus  Lucan  in his first Book  Quos ille timorum  Maximus haud urget Lethi metus inde ruendi  In ferrum mens prona viris  Who fearless  ev'n of Death  fears  blackest  fright  Led on by Courage  swiftly  rush to fight  O'er  Groves  of  pointed Steel  O'erturn'd and ruin'd by polite Im∣provements  BUT when the  Roman Conquests  had possess'd the World and gain'd the heighth of  universal Monarchy  the call of War no more alarming their forgotten Valour they betook themselves to study  Arts  and  Sciences  and flourish'd for a while in all the Blessings of  meridian Glory  but the dictates  of their Learning  fatally encourag'd  soon inspir'd their glowing Bosoms with a scorn of Slavery and produc'd such  bloody  and  intestine Discords  as o'er∣turn'd the  Grandeur  of their  spreading Empire  and involv'd the  Government  in all the miseries of divided Ruin  HOWEVER as 'tis natural for the working Brains of Man to fix  attentively  on some peculiar and selected Object how wide soever from the fashionable Practice of the Times they live in so  some  are found  among the Turks  whose native Curiosity inclines them to the search of what  small share of Knowledge  they can  possibly  attain from the perusal of those  few  and  tri∣fling Books  they have among them  The first ad∣vance of  Tur∣kish  Learning  AND tho' for reasons mention'd in the Chapter of the  Turkish  Policy the Art of  Printing  is prohibited among those People 'tis not likely they should reach so great Perfection in the Study of  Philosophy  and other du∣bious Parts of Learning as the more inlightn'd Scholars of the  Christian  World yet are not  all  so meanly ignorant as the  generality  The Person whose Ambition leads him to bestow upon some favourite Son a costly Education  generous  and  particular  must first begin like those in  Christen∣dom  and see them  taught  their A B C or  Alphabetic  Knowledge of the  Turkish  Language  The Know∣ledge of the Alphabet as much as is re∣quir'd in any  Turkish  Mini∣ster of State  NOR is the Knowledge of their  Orthographic  Learning look'd upon  as here with us  like Childrens Study and the first accomplishment of every mean Capacity But  on the contrary  nothing further is requir'd from such as are elected to the greatest Places of the  Empire  than to be qualified to read a Chapter in the  Alcoran  and sign with their respective Names the written Instruments dispatch'd about from Place to Place by their Au∣thority  Scribes or publick Nota∣ries us'd much in  Turkey  SCARCE  One  in  many Hundreds  of the  Sultan  's Subjects tho' they read perhaps indifferently well can write  his Name  or form one single Letter of the  Alphabet  so that when any Business offers which they would acquaint a Friend with who resides at any distance from the Towns they live in they must address themselves to certain  Scribes  or  Publick Notaries  whose peculiar  Trade  it is to write the  Letters Wills  or other Paper In∣struments of any such as will employ them  Their Num∣ber in  Con∣stantinople  NO less than  Thirty Thousand  of these  Publick Scribes  at present dwell in  full Employment  in the City of  Constantinople  and proportionable Num∣bers are distributed by order of the Court to other Cities of the  Empire  They are admitted  upon full Examination  by the  Great Vizier  or some infe∣rior Officer deputed by him They take an Oath to keep all Secrets no ways tending to the  Sultan  's prejudice but discover every little Hint that looks like Treason hereby 'tis difficult  beyond Imagination  to maintain a treacherous or illegal Correspondence  Their several Businesses  NOT only  Letters  and the little Instruments of  private Business  are dis∣patch'd  promiscuously  by the  Scribes  abovenam'd but all the Copies of such  ancient Manuscripts  or  modern Treatises  as are in use among them must be frequently transcrib'd by some of  these  the Art of Printing not allow'd as I before inform'd you  The art of Writing fair in great Per∣fection with the  Turks  HOWEVER  Omne malum habet in se bonum  Every  Ill  contains some  Good  within its self The  Scribes of Turkey  by perpetual Practice are become such  Masters  in the Art of  Penmanship  that they have  Pieces  com∣mon in their meanest Houses which for justness of Design equality of Character and accomplish'd  Beauty Grace  and  Smoothness  cannot be  exceeded or indeed  match'd  by the politest  WritingMasters  known in  Europe  The difficulty of sending Letters to any Part of the  Turkish  Em∣pire  SINCE I have had occasion here to speak of  Letters  'twill not be digressive from the Subject of the Chapter to acquaint the Reader that in order to prevent the ill Effects of treasonable Correspondences they per∣mit no settled  Posts  in any Part of  Turkey  so that he who wou'd dispatch a Letter to a Friend tho' hardly fifty Miles asunder is oblig'd to hire  on purpose  some  Courier  or proper Messenger or must be forc'd to stay the motion of a  Caravan  or the departure of a certain sort of  Messagebearers  Natives of  Arabia  who ramble  up and down  on foot to every Corner of the  Turkish Empire  and will carry Letters for a large Reward to the remotest Borders of the  Turks  Dominions  The danger of travelling a∣lone very great in  Tur∣key  THE Reader will conclude that  wanting Posts upon the Roads  must ren∣der Travelling a vast  expence fatigue  and  hazard  and really where a Man presumes to trust himself  alone  or  undefended  by the Power of some re∣spected Order he exposes rashly both his Fortune and his Life to the  repeated Insults  he is sure to meet with from the barbarous Wretches he must pass by in his Journey  How a Man must do to travel safely  BUT the Man who knows the Custom of the Country will be sure to hire a  Turkish  Janizary to accompany him by whose Protection he will not only be secure from Danger but may  Eat  and  Drink Sleep Ride  or what he pleases free from Charge upon the  oftinvaded Property  of the  poor enslav'd  and  miserable Inhabitants  The second Step of  Turkish  Learning  BUT to return to what I was about no sooner has the Student gain'd a  full  and  finish'd  Knowledge of these earliest Rudiments but he proceeds to change his  Theory  to  Practice  and apply himself to study with the utmost care and venerable industry the  unnumbred Intricacies  of their  Alcoran  for to be learn'd  in that  is what they all desire with eager Emulation as the Means whereby they gain the reputation of accomplish'd Scholars and are throughly qualified for any  Post  of Honour or Religion  The great respect the  Turks  show to such as are well vers'd in the Exposition of their  Alco∣ran  THE Men who reach Perfection or as great an Height as can be well attain'd in this respected Study  are on all hands  sought to by the common People as the  Oracles  of their Religion and undoubted Solvers of the most abstruse and noted Difficulties but  more than any other  are esteem'd a sort of Men who by a daily running over the several Chapters which compose their  Alcoran  in time commit it to their Memories and can repeat in or∣der every Sentence of its valued Doctrine so that bearing as it were the Body of their whole Religion within themselves they are esteem'd as Sa∣cred as the Book it self and every where distinguish'd by such shining Pri∣vileges as declare how much the  Turks    O shame of Christendom  encou∣rage more than we the Study of Religion  The  Turkish  Language rough and be∣holding to other Dialects  THE  Turkish  Language  rough  and  inharmonious  is oblig'd to the  Ara∣bian Persian  and  Chaldean  Tongues for all the softness it at present boasts which  notwithstanding  is so very little and so seldom understood by com∣mon People that the  Turks  of late difuse the Practice of that  borrow'd  sweetness  once  the aim of all their Nation  Italian  the only Western Language studied by the  Turks  OF all the noble Languages at present spoken by the Western World  Italian  is the only Favourite among the  Turks  and that being seldom un∣derstood beyond the superficial Knowledge of a common Conversation the  Latin German Spanish French  or  British Dialects  are altogether strangers to their  Learning  or  Affections  nor is the  Graecian  Tongue that  poor unhappy Sufferer with her ruin'd Sons so much as  sought  or any ways  esteem'd  by the illiterate Subverters of that  lamented  Nation  BUT tho' the native harshness of their own unpolish'd Tongue de∣nys that smooth enchanting  Eloquence  those various  Tropes  and graceful  Figures  which shou'd form the  fine  and  lofty Stile  requir'd in  Rhetorick  the  Turks of Note  or lovers of Improvement are not void of other Means whereby to reach a wish'd amusement which the barren Study of their barbarous Language cannot give them  The  Persian  and  Arabian  Romances much in vogue among the  Turks  THE Method then they take to raise their Souls to  emulative  heights of  Honour  and Ambition is to study an accomplishment in all the artful Turns of  Persian  and  Arabian  Oratory whereby they are inspir'd with lofty thoughts and brave desires of equalling those  great  and  noble Actions  which they read with wonder in the generous Characters of  ancient Hero's  celebrated  gloriously  in the fam'd  Romances  and ingenious  Novels  nume∣rously scatter'd  up and down  in both those Languages  The common Subjects of the  Persian  Stories  THESE  Novels  and  Romances  are compos'd by certain famous Wri∣ters who possess a  Genius  fertilely productive of inimitable turns of  Wit  and  Fancy  they consist  for the most part  of broken Remnants of the several  Histories  of worthy Men set off to great advantage by the fictitious Beauties of their strange Additions nor do they want the taking  Graces  and enchanting  Ornaments  which shine so softly thro' the various Subjects of our  British French  and  Spanish  Novels  How they are adorn'd  THEY boast their  Knights  relieving Ladies in Distress and Slavery their  Tilting Tournaments  and amorous  Courtships  their  enchanted Castles Gyants Monsters Dwarfs  and  'Squires  their  delightful Meadows murm'ring Currents shady Bowers  and  Groves of Myrtle  all which are  there  as  frequent  and  fantastical  as in any  Clelia  or  Cassandra  of them all  One  Kederlee  the same with them as St  George  among the  Christians  AMONGST the many mighty Men of  Valour  and  Renown  whose Acts of  Chivalry  they record as  Miracles  they relate prodigious and di∣verting Stories of a certain  Knight  call'd  Kederlee  who by the Actions of his Life appears no other than the fam'd St  George  that celebrated Dra∣gonkiller of the  British Nation  The Beasts which the  Turks  have plac'd in Pa∣radise  And so highly do the  Turks  respect the Memory of this illustrious  Champion  that in regard of his unequall'd and surprizing Merits they have given his  Horse  a Seat in  Paradise  and plac'd him  there  in state and  glory  with the  Ass  whereon our  Saviour  rode the  Dog  belonging to the  Seven Sleepers  and the favourite  Camel  of their Prophet  Mahomet  The  Turks  un∣skill'd in Hi∣story  AS for the delightful and improving Knowledge of  History  the  Turks  are wholly destitute of any means whereby to reach the smallest Skill in that engaging  Study  for tho' they take a constant care to keep  exact  and punctual Records of the  Rise  and  Progress  of their own prodigious Empire they are so ignorantly defective in the Study of  Chronology  that by the strangely rude and barbarous dictates of receiv'd  Tradition  they con∣found all  Ages Reigns  and  Persons  in the mixt disorder of a wild irre∣gularity  A strange O∣pinion of the  Turks  con∣corning  Solo∣mon  and  Ho∣mer  THUS they look on  Solomon  and  Homer  to have been two Brothers who contended with each other for the Bays bestow'd upon the most deser∣ving  Poet  and believe that  Homer  having gain'd the universal  Plaudit  of the Judges of those times was envied by his Brother  Solomon  and being banish'd from the Court was forc'd to roam about the World and beg a livelyhood from charitable Contributions  I know not how it comes to pass but  Solomon  is now the only Prince who lives in their Traditions and so great a Notion have they form'd of his extensive Power and the splendour of his Government that they have listed all the famous  Monarchs  of the ancient World as Servants to his Grandeur  Another of  Julius Caesar Job  and  A∣lexander  the Great  THUS is the celebrated  Julius Caesar  thought by  all the Turks  to have been  Admiral  of a prodigious Fleet of Ships belonging to the abovenam'd  Solomon  consisting of a Thousand and odd Hundred Sail They say that  Alexander the Great  was the illustrious  General  of his victorious Armies and that  Job so famous for his exemplary Patience  was the  Judge  of all Civil Causes of his large Dominions  More vers'd in Poetry and why enclin'd to study it  SOMEWHAT more refin'd are their Capacities in the Art of  Poetry  if that indifferent Skill they boast may claim the honour of so high a Character for the ambitious  Sultans  of the  Turkish  Empire hearing that the Works of ancient  Poets  are esteem'd in Christendom  Ambition of the  Turkish  Sultans  and having been inform'd  by Runagado  's what immortal Characters have been confer'd on former  Princes  by the Pens of such as writ harmoniously became inspir'd with eager Wishes that their own great Actions might be copy'd to ad∣vantage by some  Eastern  Muse and so transmitted  with a shining Glory  to the praises of Posterity  The  Turkish  Language too rough for Poetry  THIS flatt'ring Notion of the  Turkish  Monarchs caus'd an eager ap∣plication of their Subjects Fancies to the favour'd study of Poetic Excel∣lence but the unpolish'd Cadence of their  guttural Language  not allowing them sufficient Harmony they make but dull insipid Verses unless they tune their Muses to the warbling Lyre of smooth  Arabia  The Argu∣ments they use in its defence  HOWEVER notwithstanding all the disadvantages they meet in their attempt they still continue to improve their Genius in the practice of this Study using Arguments to prove the  use  and great  necessity  of Poetic Learning not much unlike the thoughts of  Horace  in the following Verses  Vixere fortes ante Agamemnona  Multi sed omnes illacrymabiles  Ʋrgentur ignotique longa  Nocte carent quia vate sacro  Men  brave  and  valiant  liv'd before those Days  Wherein fam'd  Agamemnon  gain'd his  Praise  Yet does a dark  oblivion  shrowd their Fames  And Nights black Mists efface their glorious Names  Ʋnknown  and  unlamented  dead they lie  While Deeds of  later Hero  's never die  Hence springs the Cause  the first  no  Poets  praise  The  last  outlive their Death in  Bards immortal Lays  The Study of Poetry why oppos'd by certain rigid Sects  STRONGLY notwithstanding are these great Encouragers of  Poetry  oppos'd by certain Sects of  grave morose  and  rigid  Principles who raise Objections to the Study from the many  false  and contradictory Assertions of the greatest Poets  The Reasons which they give for their dislike of Po∣etry  which besides the scandal they affirm it must infal∣libly create to their unstain'd and holy Doctrine has another ill Effect which is so painting over all the Vices of a  Man  or  Nation  and so Satyri∣cally detracting from their envied Virtues that Posterity will be oblig'd to read a mix'd Account of  Truth  and  Falsehood  without the smallest pos∣sibility of distinguishing  with certainty  between the  one  and the  other  And herein they seem to blame such noted Fictions as those for which  Ausonius  censures  Virgil  in the following  Verses  on the Statue of  Queen Dido  as I remember in the th Epigram  Auson Epig    Illa ego sum  Dido  vultu quam conspicis hospes  Assimulata modis pulchraque mirificis  Talis eram sed non  Maro  quam mihi finxit erat Mens  Vita nec incestis laeta cupidinibus  Namque nec  Aeneas  vidit me  Troius  unquam  Nec Libyam advenit classibus Iliacis  Sed furias fugiens atque arma procacis Iarbae  Servavi fateor morte pudicitiam  Pectore transfixo castos quod pertulit enses  Non furor aut laeso crudus amore dolor  Sic cecidisse juvat Vixi sine vulnere famae  Ʋlta virum positis moenibus oppetii  Invida cur in me stimulasti musa MARONEM  Fingeret ut nostrae damna pudicitiae  Vos magis Historicis lectores credite de me  Quam qui furta  Deum  concubitusque canunt  Falsidici vates Temerant qui carmine verum  Humanisque  Deos  assimulant vitiis  The Epigram in  English  I am that  Dido  's Image  kind  and  fair  Whose  Form  thou seest here carv'd with artful Air  Such was my Body but my  Soul  ne'er knew  The Crimes which  Virgil  made my Story do  Nor was my Life debauch'd by loose Desires  Nor burnt my honour in  incestuous  Fires  Never did fam'd  Aeneas  see my Face  Nor land his  Trojan  Squadrons in this Place  Flying the Rage of proud  Iarba  's Will  To save my valued Fame I chose my self to kill  Nor was it  Madness  made my Bosome bleed  But chast and weighty  Grief  that urg'd me to the Deed  Thus did I fall  unwounded  in my Fame  My  Consort  's Wrongs reveng'd and all my Shame  And built a stately Town to celebrate my Name  But why  malicious Muse  didst thou inspire  Erroneous  Virgil  with a strange Desire  To heap a feign'd Dishonour on my Name  And sell my  Modesty  to raise his  Fame  Learn all from me credit  Historians  more  Than  those  who ne'er will give their Fables o'er  But  daringly  expose to publick View  The secret Acts of Love which  Jove  is pleas'd to do  Poets  are  Lyars  and for love of Rhymes  Will make the  Gods themselves  pertake of human Crimes  The manner of making  Turkish  Verse  THE  Turkish  Poetry consists of certain short and broken Measures chain'd  most commonly  to double Rhymes that so that  jingle of the Numbers  may atone  as much as possible  for the unpleasant roughness of the Cadence they confine their  Muses  for the most part to  low  and  doggrel  Balads or the whining Composition of some amorous Pastoral yet some few are sound among them of a very  brisk  and  sprightly Wit  who will on  Weddings Victories  or other such occasions exert their Faculties in forming some∣thing like a  Panegyrick Epithalamium Ode  or witty  Anagram  and hav∣ing done their utmost with design to please the  Patrons  they address receive a Present equal to the  merit  of the Work or rather given accor∣ding  to the  generous  or  avaritious Temper  of the Person they have com∣plimented  Examples are the surest means of teaching any thing  BUT  Examples  will be most diverting and inform the Reader more exactly of their peculiar Tast of several sorts of Poetry I  therefore  now proceed to come as near as I can trace their Language to some  remarkable  and  celebrated  Turns of  Turkish Wit  whereby the  Authors  gain'd a great and lasting Reputation  A pleasant Story of a  Turk  who hir'd Poets to make Verses on his Wed∣ding  THERE was a noted  Turk  who liv'd in  Constantinople  and had lately gain'd the Parents Approbation of a certain Lady  young  and  beau∣tiful  they were married and their  Nuptials  celebrated with a Splendour equal to their Fortunes which were great and plentiful The Sports per∣form'd on such occasions drew the Observation of all sorts of People who were treated and caress'd with wonderful Civility among the rest  un∣willing to omit the smallest point of lofty Liberality  the joyful  Bridegroom  sent an Invitation to the most esteem'd and brightest  Poets  of the City assur∣ing them they should receive an hearty welcome and to tempt the trial of their utmost Skill inform'd 'em he design'd a good Reward for him who made the finest Verses in  congratulation  of his Marriage  The Poets feasted by the Bridegroom  THE summon'd  Bards  appear'd immediately and having feasted plen∣tifully on the Bridegroom's Entertainment thought it proper to remember what they came for and retiring severally to the private Arbours of their Patron's Garden soon compos'd the  mercenary  Praises he expected from them and returning to the Place where waited the impatient Company repeated  every Man his own Performance  each submitted  each in hopes of pre∣ference  to the decisive Judgment of a fair  Majority  THE Consequences of this famous Battle of the  Turkish Muses  having made some noise about the City many Copies of their  aukward Panegyricks  were distributed about and since I was oblig'd by an Acquaintance with an  Italian  Translation of them all I wou'd not think the Pains too great  for the diversion of my Reader  to present him with their Verses in a  British  Dress the first are these which follow  The first Poets Verses  I  Mustapha Bashaw  to you great  Ali  Fav'rite of  Mahomet  and pride of  Hali  Address my Lines  you  are a Man so clever  That I cou'd wish you were to live for ever  For then the beauteous Wife you now enjoy  Wou'd bring you ev'ry Year a smiling Boy  So wou'd the  World forever  happy be  Beauty  and  Youth Wit Wealth  and  Honour  see  Your  Wife  and  Sons  wou'd prove the  former two  And the  three last  must ever shine in you  I assure the Reader I have done the  Poet  Justice in his  Fancy  and  Ex∣pression  which tho' a little brighter in the  end  than the  beginning  may be excus'd in that 'tis  more than tolerable  in a Country where the  Sun  of  Lear∣ning  shines so seldom But here comes another somewhat merry and di∣verting  The second Poets Verses  O mighty  Ali  let me swear  That a most happy Man you are  Your self is wondrous wise and witty  And  God  has sent a Wife to sit ye  But that I may discover best  How much I really think you blest  Oh Heav'ns were I one Hour of Life  To be in bed with your sweet Wife  S'bud how shou'd I for Joys then strive  And be the happiest Man alive  THE Author of this  comical Conceit  was one  Morat  a brisk and airy Spark who wou'd not lose his Jest where'er he found it but his Muse however mist the  Prize  and tho' the  Bridegroom  seem'd well pleas'd and laugh'd for company he was not master of a  Turkish  Nature if he did not curse the  Poet  for his  odd uncommon  way of praising him A third succeeded him  more gravely  with the Lines which follow  I  The third Po∣ets Panegyrick on the Bride∣groom  God made two  Sparks  of heav'nly Fire  More  bright  than others were  Fram'd 'em to kindle  soft desire  Both  Spotless Chast  and  Fair  II  Go down says He to  Earth  and  there  Long wander up and down  Till having found the  loveliest Pair  Their Bliss by  Marriage  crown  III  They came and journey'd long in vain  Untill they found the Two  Then  center'd here  and  now  contain  The  destin'd  Joys of you  A comical Reward for Poetry  SOME other Poets tried their Skill but  all  fell short of  these  and one  Zulduc  the Author of the last was judg'd deserving of the promis'd Prize which was accordingly bestow'd upon him by the  Bridegroom  's Or∣der the Present was a wellshap'd  Ass  with  Saddle  and  Caparison  em∣broidred richly and the  Bridle Breastpiece  and the other Harness all emboss'd with polish'd Silver of which Metal were the large and weigh∣ty  Stirrops  made according to the  Turkish  Fashion  THIS strange  illchosen  Present soon alarm'd the Town with mirth and wonder at the novelty of our triumphant  Poet  's odd Reward and 'mongst the many others who reflected pleasantly upon the  Turks  unfashio∣nable Gift a certain humerous  Spanish Runnagado  skill'd compleatly in the  Eastern  Languages and still retaining sprightly  Reliques  of his Coun∣tries  Genius  was a little sharp upon the Subject in the following  Satyr  A Spanish Runnagado's Satyr on the Bridegroom and his Pre∣sent  Complain not poor  Zulduc  that thy Reward  Seems not to speak a  generous  regard  Thou dost  alas  mistake thy Patron's Mind  The  Gift  he made thee proves him  more than kind    For as a Lover whom strong Passions move  Yields up  himself  a Sacrifice to Love  So  Ali  's Hand has giv'n to thee  dull Man  Tho' not  himself  as near it as he can  For  Nature Bridle Saddle  all combine  To show how near the  Ass  and  latenoos'd Ali  join  The Conditi∣on of Musick among the  Turks  PROCEED we now to  Musick  's Charms as  like  to those of  Poetry  as possible yet not so much encourag'd by the  Turkish  Nation who are al∣together  Strangers to the melting Strains of Vocal Harmony nor under∣stand the charming use of those delightful Instruments whose elevating sounds have unresisted Power to move the Souls of dying Men and make the poor desponding Wretch forget his Sorrows and erect  with Joy  his drooping Head to hear the  soft  and  tunefull  Call that lulls his Cares and hushes  for a while  his loud Misfortunes  Their Notions thereof a sort of Paradox  THE Notion of the  Turks  concerning  Musick  will appear a  Paradox  for they abhor the  brisk  and  airy  Tunes of  Christian  Composition and alike despise the dulcid Notes and melancholy soft complaining Strokes of grave  Sonata  's  The shape of a  Turkish  Ghit∣tarr  yet are they never easy  when alone  unless they have a kind of course  Ghitarr  or such a sort of Instrument consisting commonly of se∣veral Wires upon a long and slender wooden Body with a round capa∣cious hollow head the form whereof is represented in the  Cutt  relating to the  Graecian Wedding  in the one and twentieth Chapter above the Letter  I  on the right hand of the Figures  Their manner of using it  WITH this dull Instrument the solitary  Turks  divert themselves in e∣very Place and every Company they place it in the left hand and tur∣ning its unweildy Belly to their Sides with the unheeding Fingers of their other Hand strike up and down  at random  all the Wires and whine out horrid and unpleasant Noises to the  humdrum  Echo's of their barbarous Instrument  The strange esteem the  Turks  profess for the above∣nam'd Instru∣ment  YET so bewitch'd are all the  Turks  to this ridiculous Amusement that a Stranger must be plagu'd in every corner of their Streets and Houses with repeated sounds of dolefull Airs and noisy Voices void of harmony nay to such extravagant Affection are they now arriv'd for this prevailing Fashion that the  Soldiers  go not to the War without their  Fiddles  nor can any travel half a Day in  Turkish  Territories but he shall see a grave  longbearded Mussulman  sit singly  crosslegg'd  under some large  Oak  or sha∣dy  Cypress  pleasing his conceit with melancholy Ditties to the  Strumstrum  Musick of his thrum'd Ghittarr while his poor Horse is turn'd to graze a∣bout the Field and seeks the pleasure of a more substantial Entertain∣ment  The shape and use of the  Turkish  BaseViol  ANOTHER Instrument in use among the  Turks  is a large wooden Trunk not much unlike the fashion of the former whereto one large and  rozin'd  twisted Catsgut is affix'd so straitly that by scraping thereupon with a proportionable Bow a certain hoarse and hollow murmur strikes the Ear like the unpleasant tuning of a bad  Base Viol  The form of Timbrels and how us'd in  Turkey  ANOTHER very celebrated Piece of Musick is the noise they make with jingling  Timbrels  which are form'd exactly like a Sieve the bottom made of  Buff  extreamly strong and durable small long and narrow holes about the sides contain a certain number of round thin and polish'd Plates of Brass bor'd thro' the  center  and securely fastned with a liberty to play upon a little Pin this Timbrel they make yield a very jarring and discordant sound by striking with their Fists upon the middle of the Lea∣ther which thereby affords a sort of drowsy Base to the more  shrill  and sprightly trebble of the clattering Plates of Brass about it Both these a∣bovenam'd Instruments are likewise represented in the  Cutt  aforesaid  Wind Musick not in use a∣mong them  WIND Musick is not much in vogue in any part of  Turkey  a sort of Pipe or aukward Flute they make of Reeds is what they chiefly  now  de∣light in But the  Hautboys Trumpet  and the favour'd Instruments of  Christian  Countries even from the  amorous Flute  down to the rustic Bag∣pipe are entirely strangers to the  Turkish  Practice  Drums and Kettledrums in high esteem  DRUMS they use in martial Expeditions and delight extreamly in their warlike Thunder Kettledrums they beat with skill and pleasure but they understand no Tunes nor boast the noble  Theory  of  Musick  but play by rote on any Instrument the  incoherent  dictates of a  wild extrava∣gant  and artless fancy  The  Turks  unskill'd in Logick  THE  Turkish  Studies boast no Logick nor does any Man among the most polite of all their People know its meaning no tough  Syllogisms  puz∣zle their Discourses no  Nego Minorem Majorem  or  Consequentiam  confound their Students with asserted Contradictions  The Reasons why they dis∣approve it  all is  vulgar plain  and  igno∣rant  nor do they wish to gain a clearer notion of a dangerous  Science  which they say opposes  always  and  too often  overturns the truth of  Argu∣ment  and light of  Reason  Their Igno∣rance in Me∣taphysicks  THEY know no more of  Metaphysicks  than a trifling Contest on the  Attributes  of  GOD  and that maintain'd with such absurdity and weak∣ness that the artless Tenour of their jangling Disputations cannot boast a regular proceeding but is founded grosly on the obstinate profession of il∣literate Contrarieties  Physick not well under∣stood in  Tur∣key  PHYSICK is esteem'd a sacred Study but their Ignorance therein exceeds belief for tho' the ancient  Doctors  of  Arabia  were the best  Physi∣tians  of the times they liv'd in and cou'd say with  Solomon  they knew the  vegetable  nurseries of  Nature  nay cou'd tell their Virtues from the  Cedar  to the  Hyssop  yet the modern  Arabs  and the spacious Body of the  Turkish Empire  are eclips'd by Clouds of such supine  Obscurity  that they can boast no good  Physician  in their Nation but respect a  Quack  if bred in  Christen∣dom  as an undoubted Master of an useful Science which their want of Learning or neglect of Opportunities deny  themselves  the smallest know∣ledge of  Navigation how far known to  Turkish  Mari∣ners  NAVIGATION as I said before is little understood by  Turkish  Mariners The Compass is  by them  divided into Eight great Points and the dependant Usefullness of that illustrious Art so much unknown that they can only sail before the Wind and while the nimble Ships of other Nations ply  with ease  their handy  Tacks  to  starboard  or to  larboard  Quarter  veer about lie by  and coming up within few Points of  every Wind  sail on  secure  in spight of  adverse  and  tempestuous Weather  the baffled Efforts of the  Turkish Sailors  sailing their Desires the unweildy Vessels of those ignorant People must be forc'd to creep for hospitable shelter to the close protection of some neigh'bring Harbour and expect with patience the desir'd return of pro∣per Winds to prosecute their Voyages  The State of their Geogra∣phic Learn∣ing  GEOGRAPHY is so unknown among them that they hardly find a possibility of reaching Skill enough to learn the situation of their own Dominions and so very dark are their Capacities  that way  that some  the most refin'd among them  have desir'd me to inform them whether  Britain  did not border on the Mouth of the  Mediterranean  and the  King of France  's Territories spread their Frontiers to the  Western Indies  Geometry Astronomy and Astrolo∣gy how far known in  Turkey  GEOMETRY they cannot boast the smallest Notion of and are ex∣treamly ignorant of  Astronomical  Observations yet some are found in  Tur∣key  who pretend to  Schemes  and  Figures  in  Astrology  and calculate  Nati∣vities  for superstitious People when even those very Men who pass for  Conjurers  and are esteem'd  as such  by the unthinking Populace behold  with wonder  the surprizing Form and advantageous Uses of our  Christian Globes Celestial  or  Terrestrial  BUT let us now descend from lofty Studies to the Rural Practices of Country Labours and we shall perceive the common Ignorance as for∣midable  there  as in their Schools of Education and unpolish'd  Semina∣ries  of Religion and Philosophy  The  Turks  un∣skill'd in Husbandry  SO little are they skill'd in  Agriculture  and the Art of  Gardening  that where the Ground requires  manuring  they are wholly ignorant of all Im∣provements which the rustic Arts of  European Husbandmen  have taught the Practice of and let it lie  neglected  and  untill'd  not useful to themselves nor advantageous to Posterity  Their Lands extreamly fertil  BUT Providence has  strangely  so ordain'd that they possess such  fertil  and  productive  Territories as will yield the Blessings of a  double Harvest  from the easy Labours of an  unfatigu'd  and pleasing Industry  Greeks  com∣monly em∣ploy'd to till the Ground  YET are the  native Turks  so giv'n to  Luxury  that few among them care to take the smallest Pains in  rural  Practices but  on the contrary  they still employ the subject  Greeks  to do their Drudgery and live supinely like the lazy  Drones  upon the plunder'd  Honey  of the  Bees  about 'em  The Reason why the  Turks  neglect im∣proving Lands  AND perhaps this universal negligence in Country matters may proceed from that inglorious and submissive Slavery wherein they live and which depresses weightily their  unsupported Spirits  by the sad reflections of their miserable Servitude to an  unbounded Monarch  who possesses  at their Deaths  the Product of their Labours and becomes  sole Heir  to all their Lands excluding  even the Children  of a frugal  Father  from the wish'd en∣joyment of a  ravish'd Patrimony  How a Coun∣try Life may be unpleasant  FOR tho' the Charms and various Pleasures of a Country Life may tempt the Inclinations of a thinking Man to leave the hurries of a Towndestraction and relax the Springs of wearied Life in gentle Solitude yet is not any of these flattering Blessings to be  met  or  hop'd for  from a Rural Life encumbred with the plagues of noisy Discord and severe effects of an insulted Slavery where every Moment may produce some  strange  and unexpected Accident and reduce the  Owner  of a rolling Plenty to the shame of Poverty or  Military Ravages  upon the spiteful  Nod  of some  capricious Governour  When and how a Coun∣try Life is tru∣ly happy  THEN O  sweet  and  gentle Solitude  are thy Retirements truly happy when we can enjoy  secure from danger  the inviting Pleasures of thy dulcid Mansions when the softer Wishes of our peaceful Souls may  free  and  un∣confin'd  become successful and our  undisturb'd  and blissful Hours roll smoothly on within the limits of  Paternal Residence  How truly just are the exalted Notions of the  Roman Horace  on the present Subject when he says  Hor  Ode d  Epod  Beatus ille qui procul negotiis  Ʋt prisca Gens Mortalium  Paterna rura bobus exercet suis  Solutus omni faenore  Neque excitatur classico Miles truci  Neque horret iratum Mare  Forumque vitat superba civium  Potentiorum limina  The Ode in  English  Happy the Man who  free from Care  As Men in former Ages were  From  Ʋsury  retires  And Plows with pure industrious Hand  With his own Steers  his  Father  's Land  The  Crown  of his Desires  No storms of  War  his  Peace  can shake  Ʋnmov'd  he sees the  Billows  break  And mocks the  Oceans  frown  He shuns  all  Courts where  Lawyers  are  Disdains the  haughty  Grandeur there  Contented with his own  BY what has been  already  said the  Reader  may conceive  with ease  the utmost altitude of  Turkish  Learning I shall  now  proceed  in the ensuing Chapter  to inform him of the  Morals  of those mighty People  CHAP X Of the  Turkish  Morals  All Men by Nature more or less are taught Mora∣lity  THE Reader can expect no elevated Notions of refin'd Morality from such as live on others Misery and owe the Grandeur of their lofty Fortune to the bloody Ruin of invaded Nations yet as  Natures  Dictates and the common Lessons of a mild Huma∣nity excite Mankind to do the  Justice  they again expect so have the  Turks in the last Age  been more refin'd than formerly they were by fre∣quent Converse with the  Christian Nations  which their extended Con∣quests made their  Neighbours  Some  British  Travellers have flatter'd the  Turks  STRANGELY do the Characters which all our Travellers have given the  Turks  mistake their Nature some Ingenious Gentlemen  the Natives of Great Britain  have thought fit to speak those People noble Ma∣sters of a spotless Vertue and describe them sailing in a Sea of Glory la∣den richly with the golden Notions of  Morality  and  Wisdom  which distin∣guish'd anciently the Great Inhabitants of the Countries they have con∣quer'd  Others have detracted from their real  Merits  OTHERS  less obliging  but  alike mistaken  byass'd by the Follies of a fond  Partiality  allow them owners of  not one  commendable or vertuous Practice but describe their Natures wholly sunk in dull Stupidity and  universally  inclin'd to  Mischief  and  Iniquity  A  Medium  most eligible and the near∣est Truth  THESE  Extreams  are  both  to be rejected and a modest  Medium  cho∣sen to direct us we shall  then  discover that the same  variety  of  Humour  and  Morality  now reigns in  Turkey  that is found in  Christendom  and that the numerous  Mahometans  are  like our selves  divided into  Good  and  Bad  accor∣ding to the Lessons of their different Educations or the contrary Impulses of a  vicious Soul  or one inspir'd with a sublime and generous love of Vertue  Their divided Notions of Morality  NOT more divided is the  Turkish Faith  than their infirm Morality  some  holding  lawful meritorious  and  as duty  that which  other some  con∣demn as  odious sinful  and  illegal  nay to such degrees of violence do they proceed herein that some believe it Sin to  pity Christians  others hold it Charity to  relieve them  some hate  Mirth  and others  Sorrow  some love one thing some another each opposing t'others Principle with all the malice of discordant Obstinacy as is describ'd by  Horace  in the eighteenth Epistle of his first Book  Oderunt hilarem tristes tristemque jocosi  Sedatum celeres agilem gnavumque remissi  The  Sad  the  Airy  hate the  Brisk  the  Sad  The  Swift  the  Slow despise  the  Joyless  hate the  Glad  BUT to let the  Curious  clearly understand in what Condition are main∣tain'd the  common Morals  of the  Turks  in general I will transcribe a sort of  Catechism  taught their Children who imbibing early what the Parents make 'em learn continue  when grown up  to justifie their Tenets The In∣terrogatories are as follow  A  Turkish  Ca∣techism  Q  Tell me thy Name  A  My Name is  Mustapha  Q  How wert thou made  A  By One Great God  alone  and  indivisible Almighty Mercifull Omniscient Sempiternal  full of Truth and rich in Glory  Q  By what means dost thou hope to gain Salvation  A  By walking strictly in the Paths of Holiness as measur'd out by God's Decree and set before all true  Believers  by the goodness and compassion of our Pastor  Mahomet  whose Name be Sacred sent by God to teach Mankind and  now  in  Heaven  his mighty true and  only Prophet  Q  How dost thou expect to gain his Favour or reward his Goodness  A  By promoting his Religion and a Charitable Pity of my Fellow Creatures  Q  How must his Religion be promoted  A  By destroying with the  Sword  and  Fire  all such as dare oppose his holy Doctrine till the Infidels are rooted from the  Earth  and all the  Ʋniverse  submits to own his Glory  Q  How will you extend the  Charity  injoin'd you  A  By erecting  Hans  or publick Inns for entertaining poor  be∣nighted Pilgrims  building  Bagnio's  and endowing  Mosques  with large Revenues if  the Lord of Paradise  is pleas'd to bless me with a plentifull Ability  If not  by giving free∣ly  to the Poor  as much as I can spare redeeming Slaves and looking upon the  Beasts  which serve our Uses with a mild Compassion  Q  How are you to pity  Beasts  or  Birds  which serve you  A  When an  Ox Ass Horse Dog Mule  or  Camel  has for ma∣ny Years been truly serviceable I must let him graze in peace about my Grounds and live the rest of his  disabled  Life entirely free from  Toil  or  Drudgery  as a Reward for all his former Labours  Q  What else are you requir'd to do to such poor Animals  A  I am oblig'd to load my Camels and all other Beasts of Bur∣then favourably and with pity buy the  Birds  that pine in  Cages  for their absent Mates and let them fly away to seek lost Liberty  Q  Who  under Mahomet  will you obey  A  My  Prince  and Parents  Q  How must you serve your Prince  A  With Life and Fortune for he is the  Lord  of all my Plenty and may honour my Head by making it his Footstool I am to  live  and  die  when  he  commands it and depend on no∣thing but  his  sacred Pleasure  Q  How will you respect your Parents  A  With the unfeign'd Duty of a meek Humility as becomes the Honour of those Persons from whom  next God  I had my Being  Q  How will you deal with your Neighbours  A  Love those who love me hate those who hate me kill those who strive to kill me but never give back  Ill  for  Good  nor  Good  for  Evil  Q  What is your highest Wish  A  On  Earth Success  and  Paradise  hereafter  Q  Is your Wish sincere If not may Heaven refuse it  A  So be it to me  THIS Catechism may convince the Reader that howsoever differing their Notions are in other Points they all concur in one unanimous re∣spect wherewith they humbly own the Power of  God  and worship his  Divinity  of which the eldest Ages of  Antiquity  acknowledge the assur'd Existence and  Hesiod  seemingly inspir'd with more than  Heathenish  light of Reason thus expresses  A Quotation from  Hesiod  concerning the Power of God  Highthund'ring  Jove  who in Heav'ns loftiest Throne  Sits  uncontroul'd  and rules the World  alone  At pleasure  lifts  to Empire  lowly Swains  And hurls from  boasted Grandeur  him who reigns  With ease extirpates Lines of noblest Race  And gives  undreamt  of Honours to the Base  In short his Arm can make the Crooked Straight  And draw out  all the Pride  which swells the haughty  Great  The bad Ef∣fect of a bad Opinion  THEIR Notions of the  Duty  which obliges them to propagate the Doctrine of their  Prophet  leads their  Reason Justice  and  Humanity  so much astray that neither  Promise Vow  nor  solemn Oath  can bind their  Con∣science  to omit an opportunity of adding any thing to former Acqui∣sitions  The  Turkish  Trade is ma∣nag'd by the  Jews  BY this means  Christians  find it dangerous to deal in  Turkey  and gaining no security from sacred Oaths nor  oftrepeated  Promises refuse to credit such as they suspect who  therefore  not regarding publick Business leave the management of all their  Trade  to crafty  Jews  a People  wily  and industrious in the art of Cheating handsomely and who are numerously spread o'er every Corner of the  Turkish Empire Constantinople and its Neighbourhood  containing many Thousands of those scatter'd People  The crime of Lying seldom known a∣mong the  Turks  LYING is a Crime not often known in  Turkey  nor does any Man affirm for certain Truth what is not  prov'd so  by his own Experience and  speaking generally  when a  Turk  has stroak'd his Beard and laid his Hand with gravity upon his Breast sedately to assert some question'd Point you may  securely  take his Word nor is he ever known to falsifie his Promise  Swearing practis'd and encourag'd  OF all the  Turks  immoral Practices the Vice of  Swearing  to a strange extravagance is most in fashion and so oddly  new  and different from  ours  are their invented  Oaths  and  Curses  that it will not be a needless trouble to inform the  Reader  what uncommon Thoughts those People exercise on such occasions  Strange and unexampl'd Curses us'd in  Turkey  THUS for example When they would express their anger to a  Man  or  Beast  they do it commonly in the rash and inconsiderate manner follow∣ing  May the Graves black Angel fry your Soul May you vomit up your Bowels and your Heart Strings burst in sunder May the Birds of Heav'n defile your Head and your unwash'd Body damn your Soul to future Vengeance  But more ridiculous and impiously void of reason is a Method they incourage by a constant Practice cursing with a strange and senseless fury things  inanimate  and void of Understanding if a  Man  affronts 'em  Camel Horse  or any other Beast of burthen checks their Will or any accidental stumble  o'er a Stone  provokes their Passion they proceed  without reflecting on the Object of their Rage  to vent these Curses  Annah sana Secteim Gaour Annah sana Yonnina Sicheim  That is I ravish'd your Mother you Infidel and I will ravish her again as she lies in her Grave  The common Oaths in use among the  Turks  THEIR common Oaths are such as these  By  Mahomet  's Great Office By the Throne of God By the Roof of Heaven By the Sea and Land By the Sul∣tan's Soul and the hairy Scalp of my Mother  Gaming how far encou∣rag'd  GAMING is so little prejudicial to the  Turkish Government  that tho' the Natives much delight therein as shall be shown hereafter it was ne∣ver known  among this People  that Estates were ruin'd and whole Families  impoverish'd  by the curs'd Effects of such a vicious Practice  Drunkeness a prevailing Vice among them  EBRIETY I have before inform'd my Reader is unlawful by their  Prophet  's Prohibition of the use of Wine or other strong intoxicating Li∣quors yet how far this weak and disregarded  Barrier  stops their progress in so lov'd a Vice will be easily conceiv'd when I assure him that no Na∣tion under Heaven is addicted more to frequent Drunkenness than are the  Turks  in private Meetings  Whoredom and Adultery but rarely practis'd  WHOREDOM and Adultery too much encourag'd by the  Chri∣stian  's Practice and alleviated commonly by the  palliating  Cloak of a pre∣tended  Gallantry  are seldom found among the  Turks  the Punishments so great and obviously known and Difficulties of obtaining Female Corre∣spondence so insuperably hazardous deterr them from attempting such  ille∣gal Love  and the little value which they hold their Women at the Slavery that poor unhappy Sex are there subjected to and the unbounded Liberty their Laws afford 'em in promiscuous Use of  Wives  and  Concubines  excite no search of such unvalued Pleasure  The  Turks  are much inclin'd to Sodomy  BUT now O black and horrid Shame I must with all the detestation of a  Christian  Zeal descend to speak a shocking Truth relating to the strange and curs'd Pollution of  inverted Nature  that ancient hellish Crime which ruin'd  Sodom  and at present reigns  among the Turks  with such libi∣dinous extravagance that they will publickly avow their countenanc'd de∣light in such a beastly and inhuman Practice  THEY have their favourite  Pooshts  or  Catamites  as common as their Concubines and ride attended to the Wars or distant Governments by rich and splendid Numbers of these young  Male Prostitutes  The means whereby the  Turks  grew fond of Sodomy  'TIS more than probable that the raging Fire of this  impetuous  Lust began to flame from the original Confinement of the  Turkish Janizaries  denied like  Roman Priests  the liberty of Marriage who therefore not sup∣porting the unwelcome Prohibition with expected resignation to the Will of their Commanders broke out in loose and wanton searches after  un∣known Pleasures  and like Water check'd in its incumber'd Chanel soon doubled former force and rapidly o'erflow'd the  delug'd  Banks whose lof∣ty Mounds had  formerly  confin'd them  The Vice en∣courag'd by Impunity  IMPUNITY for such unnatural and encroaching Guilt emboldens their Presumption to so vast an height that I remember with the greatest horror and amazement an  unexampled  Impudence I was my self a witness of at  Adrianople  A Story of a  Turk  at  Adri∣anople  SIR  Robert Sutton  now Embassador from Her Present Majesty to the Court of  Constantinople  being just arriv'd in the abovenam'd City where his Predecessor had some time expected him it was my Duty to Congra∣tulate his Entrance on that Dignity which I did in company with many  British Gentlemen  at that time there The House in which Sr  Robert  lodg'd was seated pleasantly upon a noble River which runs along the City and an open  Kiosk  or airy  Summer House  look'd out upon the Water  WE were standing here extreamly pleas'd with the delightful Prospect when from the Plain upon the other side we saw a  Turk  of middle Age and decent Habit lead a Boy about Fourteen directly to the Bank which slop'd upon the River where he thought himself securely shelter'd from the People of a Village not far distant  An incredible Proof of  Tur∣kish  Insolence  DESCENDED to a Place convenient as he thought for the execu∣tion of his Purpose he began  to our surprize and inexpressible confusion  to prepare himself and his  consenting Catamite  for acting a Design so hateful to our sight and such a stranger to our Customs that we scarce believ'd our Eyes when they beheld this Object We hallow'd loudly to the lustful Wretch who turn'd his Head with seeming wonder to perceive us there but still persisted in his first Attempt till snatching up a  Fowlingpiece  which lay by chance upon a Table in the Summer House I cock'd it and presented it against his Body as if I would have shot him dead immedi∣ately  at this  he started and adjusting the disorder of his loosned Dress retir'd precipitately with a thousand Curses on the House and Company for having baulk'd so impious an Intention  A noted Proof of God's abhor∣rence of the Crime  THERE is in  Barbary  upon the Coasts of  Fez  and in the Neighbour∣hood of that Imperial City a most strange and dreadful Proof of  God  's Re∣sentment of this growing Guilt in his surprizing Judgment on a certain  Moor  inflicted in the very moment of the beastly Action  Why unbe∣liev'd  'Tis  unbeliev'd  at least  suspected  tho' attested in the Works of  several Authors  but that common fate of Travellers Assertions shall not make me backward in main∣taining Truths I know  The folly of believing Tra∣vellers more apt to lie than other People  nor will  judicious Readers  question the Authority of any Man's Relation for his having travell'd into other Countries a  poor  a  weak malicious  Proof of  Envy  and the mean effect of  Judgments Want  or  scarcity of Honour  For Men  by Nature favourers of Truth  will still continue so what ever Place or Climate they may chance to visit For as  Horace  says  Coelum non animum mutant qui trans mare currunt  Men who o'er Seas to distant Countries rowl  Oft change  their Climate  but retain  their Soul  The particu∣lars of the Story  UPON a spacious wild unshadow'd Common in the way from  Fez  to  Arbacan  a Village not far distant you perceive at near six Furlongs from the common Road the Figure of a  Turk  committing Sodomy upon the Body of an  Ass  and coming nearer  led by wonder  or  prevailing Curio∣sity  discover it to be an  Image  form'd in very hard and solid Stone the  Hoofs Hide Hair Teeth  and  Colour  of the  Ass  as various and distinct as when alive The  Turbant  of the poor unhappy  Man  seems half unty'd and hanging  negligently  o'er his Shoulders  A very won∣derful Act of Providence  even the  Eyebrows Nose Mouth Lips  and  every Feature  of his  Face  exactly form'd to speak him  living  nay the very  Rings  upon his Fingers and the  Nails  of either Hand remain di∣stinguishably obvious to the common View alike converted into Stony Substance varying in its Colours answerable to the different Parts of that amazing  Metamorphosis  it represents  IT stands so strong and deeply rooted in surrounding Earth that nei∣ther  Man  nor  Ass  can possibly be separated nor the whole  conjunctive Mo∣nument  of Sin remov'd from its Foundation which they say has very of∣ten been  in vain attempted  A traditional Account they give of the abovenam'd Accident  TRADITION teaches  them  and they teach  Travellers  that in some old forgotten Age of which their ancient Records make no mention the miserable Wretch thus strangely represented frequently committed  Sodomy  upon the open Common with  Asses Mares  and other Beasts which graz'd  promiscuously  upon the publick Pasture but that  at last  the weighty Justice of  Almighty God  o'ertook his Insolence and chang'd him into Stone whilst busy'd in his Wickedness that so he might remain to future  Ages  an  immortal Monument  of  Heavenly Vengeance  No sort of Robbery much known in  Turkey  HOUSEBREAKING  Pocketpicking  and the meaner Practices of  PettyLarceny  are altogether strangers to the Natives of this Country who so much abhorr the Person of a  Thief  that where a Man accus'd of any Robbery escapes the hand of  Publick Justice  he will  notwithstanding  fall a Victim to the unresisted fury of the raging  Populace  for  all the Turks  are so entirely free from fear of losing Goods or Chattels by the breaking up their Dwellings that the richest Warehouses which their City boasts of oft lie whole Nights  unbarr'd  and open  in their lowest Windows  nor are these frequent Opportunities of Robbing any ways improv'd to eithers dis∣advantage  A very comi∣cal Bargain customarily made among them  BUT if they  overreach  each other in their private Dealings they do not only think it  lawful  but a  commendable discretion  and therefore 'tis a common Custom with the  Merchants  of this Country when they hire a  Broker Bookkeeper  or  other Servant  to agree that he shall claim no  Wa∣ges  but to make amends for that unprofitable disadvantage they give them  free  and  uncontroul'd Authority  to Cheat them every way they can in managing their Business  but with this Proviso  that they never must ex∣ceed the privileg'd Advantage of  ten per Cent  all under that which they can fairly gain by blinding  their respective Masters  in the settling their Accounts is properly their own and  by their Masters Will  confirm'd to their Possession  THE  British Merchants  will be apt to censure these Proceedings as  ridi∣culous  and tending to incourage  Knavery  but he will soften his Opinion when he thinks upon the  Reasons  which they give for the permission of this Custom  The Reasons why the  Turks  allow this Custom  THE  Servant  knowing he has nothing to depend on but the Profits he must gain by an industrious Application to the  art of Cheating  puts himself upon a  wily Method  of o'erreaching others in the Goods he buys  by order of his Master  whom he strives  again to overreach  by reckoning them to his Ac∣counts at  full  and  current Prizes  The  Master  on the other hand well knowing that unless he watches carefully his  Servant  's Managements he will deceive him  ten per Cent  And probably go far beyond those  tolerated Limits  becomes observant of his own Affairs and keeps his Profits in his own Possession  Murder com∣mon in the  Turks  Domi∣nions  MURDER is so dangerously common in this Country that there passes scarce a Day wherein some Man or other is not kill'd The  Turks  however rarely butcher one another but the hated  Christians  fall in every Corner wretched  Victims  to the blinded Zeal of such Mad  Pilgrims  as re∣turn from  Meccha  or the lawless Insolence of  unrestrain'd Levant  's or those who Man their Ships of War  On what ac∣count com∣mitted by sorts of Peo∣ple  the first of these transported by the Di∣ctates of delusive Doctrine aim at  Heaven  by the Death of every  Christi∣an  they may chance to meet till they are kill'd themselves by way of Ven∣geance and the last delight in  Murder  by the bloody Consequence of a licentious Education so that you can hardly pass the Streets of  Tur∣key  but you must be witness of an hundred Proofs of their inhumane Practices  A Story of a Pilgrim who endeavour'd to kill the Author  ONE Day I went on board a  British  Vessel in the Port of  Constantino∣ple  and returning to the Shore with several  Europaean  Gentlemen all dress'd according to the  Christian Fashion  we receiv'd a thousand barba∣rous Affronts as we were landing from the Boat but being long inur'd to  Turkish  Insolence we took no notice of their scurrilous Expressions but endeavour'd to have pass'd 'em by with an uncommon exercise of  Pati∣ence  and Humility till we perceiv'd a certain tatter'd Wretch  in Habit of  a Pilgrim  leaping up and down with  elevated Eyes contracted Forehead  and a Visage full of  Passion  and  Deformity  he held a  Dagger  in his hand and skip'd about with such conceited violence as made me take his  zealous Transports  for an Air of Madness so that thinking him some simple  Antick  I laugh'd aloud at his extravagant Diversion  The barbarous Action of a zealous Mad∣man  HE saw me laugh and made directly towards me with his brandish'd Weapon which a  Greek Interpreter  endeavouring to turn aside receiv'd  unhappily to the Hilt  within his Bosom I began  at this  to change my hu∣mour and endeavour to prevent the proffer'd Salutation of the  Pilgrim's Dagger  stepping back I drew my Sword and kept him at a distance still retiring from his aggravated Fury which being now encreas'd to double height by now and then a thrust upon his Wrist he grew quite desperate and finding that he cou'd not come within my Sword step'd back a Foot or two to gather force and threw the Dagger swiftly at my Breast with all the Strength that  Zeal  and  Anger  cou'd supply his Arm with  An odd way of reaching Heaven  PROVIDENCE perverted its  design'd  Effect and led me to avoid the danger of its Point by sinking suddenly with Knees upon the Ground but dreading the Event of his continued Villany I made a strong and lucky Thrust which pierc'd his Bosome through and through and brought him stagg'ring to the Ground to reach the  Paradise  he hop'd to gain by such a bloody Method and inhumane Species of mistaken Merit  NOT one pretended to detain us from Escaping but on the contrary discontinued all their Insolences to gather  numerously  round the Body and repeat a  Prayer  for his departing Soul desiring  Mahomet  to see the  Piety  of his Intention and reward his Death with the assur'd Possession of expected Glory  A strange and horrid Principle alike destructive to the  Turks them∣selves  and Strangers in their Country who seldom let the Death of an  assaulted Friend  go unreveng'd by which means all the Trading Towns of  Turkey  constantly afford successive Scenes of Murder and Destraction  THE wonderful Discovery of a barbarous Murder hap'ning in the time of my continuance in this Country claims a Place in my Remarks for two great Reasons  first  the oddness of the thing it self distinguishes the Accident in a surprizing Manner and  secondly  the  neversleeping  Justice of  Almighty God  appears conspicuously in the strange Conviction of so black a Villany  A Story of the wonderful discovery of a Murder  THE  Sackah  or the Man who carry'd Water for the Use of our  Em∣bassador  at  Constantinople  us'd to fill his Leathern Vessels at a very  deep  and ancient  Well  not far beyond the Buildings of the City where  one Morning  he with great surprize beheld the lifeless Body of a Man  without his Head  lie weltring in a stream of Blood  disrob'd  and mangled in a thousand Pla∣ces to disguise him from the Knowledge of such  Travellers  as might occasi∣onally pass that way  A cursed Po∣licy  the  virile  marks of Nature were entirely cut away that so the Proofs of  Circumcision  or  omission of that Ceremony  might not speak him  Turk  or  Christian  CONCERN'D to view so sad a Spectacle the melancholy  Sackah  soon return'd and telling every Man he saw the Accident he met with endless Crouds of curious People flock'd to see the headless Trunk of this unknown and miserable Object for a  Week  or  Two  it made a mighty noise about the Town and great Enquiries were  for some time made  in or∣der to discover the inhuman Author of this strange Barbarity  An undeniable Instance of God's Care and Justice  BUT full three Months were now expir'd and no news came of any Man so much as guess'd to be concern'd therein so by degrees it was forgot and silenc'd till  the hand of Heaven  thought fit to point out the  un∣dreading Villain  and deliver him to Justice which he thought himself too wise to be detected by  Hor  Ode  Lib    Raro antecedentem scelestum  Deseruit pede poena claudo  Rarely does  Vengeance  quit the Villains Chace  Tho' She pursues his Crimes with a  slow halting  Pace  THERE was a public ShootingMatch  with Bows and Arrows  appoin∣ted to be held upon that very spot of Ground wherein the  Well  was dug near which the Body had before been found unnumber'd Multitudes were gather'd to behold the Skill of the  Competitors  and being heated by variety of Exercise drew Water from the  Well  and cool'd themselves by drinking it  The Murde∣rers Name and Quality  A Crowd of Men were gather'd round the Brink and gave a sudden Shout as if surpriz'd at some  undream't of Novelty  from every corner of the Field the People ran to know the matter and  among the rest  one  Cara Musul Alimet  a Scrivener of the City press'd among the foremost to de∣mand Particulars  HE was no sooner come but looking o'er the Shoulders of a Man or two who stood before him he perceiv'd  to his confusion and astonishment  that one who had design'd to draw up Water in the  Bucket  had attracted to the  Brim  of the surrounded  Well  a dead Man's Head all  pale  and  ghast∣ly  hanging  by the Hair  upon the Iron of the  Bucket  A most pro∣digious and amazing Acci∣dent  HE had reason to appear amaz'd and had begun to tremble when the  Head  fell suddenly from off the Pail and tumbled swiftly o'er a sloping Ground till it arriv'd directly underneath his Feet and there lay still its horrid Face and dreadfull Visage turn'd quite upwards seeming to accuse the silent Guilt of his confounded Murderer  The Name and Quality of the Person murder'd  THE trembling Wretch half dead with fear confess'd he had been  Author  of the famous Murder that had been  of late  so much discours'd of telling those about him that the Name of him he kill'd was  Gurat Oglani  a Merchant of  Aleppo  newly come from thence to sell some  Jewels  he had bought a Pennyworth of the  Eastern Caravan  that he had been directed to his House by Letters from a Friend to  lodge  and  board  while he conti∣nued in the City and that cursed Avarice had tempted his desires to kill him  on a certain Evening  near that  Well  into which he threw the Head and had so cut and mangled all the Body that he knew 'twou'd be impossi∣ble it shou'd be  known  or guess'd at  A very curi∣ous and parti∣cular Obser∣vation  CONFESSION was enough to gain a Sentence for the Villain's Death who being  broken on a Wheel  directly in the Place the Murder was committed in acknowledg'd it to be  as near as he cou'd guess  that ve∣ry Spot whereto the  Head  had roll'd and stop'd beneath his Feet when first he own'd the  monstrous Action  The  Turks  more prone to Vice than Vertue  THUS much shall serve to have spoken of the  Turkish Morals  who are generally more inclin'd to  Vice  than  Vertue  and tho' there are some Men  sincerely Pious  sound among them yet are the greatest Part of those who pass for Men of  zealous  and  religious  Principles but  seemingly  affected  with the love of Piety and rather honest by the fear of  Punishment  for acting wickedly than by the pungent Dictates of a  tender Conscience  directly contrary to the Vertuous Man whom  Horace  thus describes in the th Epistle of his first Book  Hor  Epist  Lib    Tu nihil admittes in te formidine poenae  Oderunt peccare boni virtutis amore  Never let  fear of Punishment  incline  Thy  backward  Will to act a good Design  He who is  truly worthy  hates to  Sin  'Cause  Guilt  must wait  without  where  Vertue  dwells within  I lead my  Reader now  to view their  Trade  which with their  vari∣ous  and  peculiar  Arts of Management therein will be the only Subject of the following Chapter  CHAP XI Of their Trade  Foreign  and  Domestick  The  Turks  not ignorant of the Advanta∣ges of Trade  THE numerous Advantages of  Foreign Trade  and vast Improve∣ments which those Nations make to whom the Benefits of an extended Commerce open great and glorious Blessings are so en∣tirely known and envied by the  Turkish Court  that they reflect with grief upon those Maxims of their Policy whose rigid Dictates have confin'd their  Traffick  to the meaner Profits of  Domestick Correspondence  THEY would willingly abate the rigour of their Laws to tast the Sweets of so desir'd a Liberty but fear the breaking one Decree should shock another  Why not encourag'd by their  Government  for 'twould be full as dangerous to a  Turkish Sultan  to per∣mit a Traffick  Foreign  and  Domestick  and thereby let his People grow more Rich and Wise as should some heedless Sailor in tempestuous Wea∣ther strike a Window thro the Sides of a deep loaden Vessel to admit the Light and thereby let in dangerous Waves to sink the Ship in a tumul∣tuous Ocean however their esteem for  Trade  and inclinations to encou∣rage it as far as may consist with the Security of the  Sultan  and his  Power  may be discover'd by the Efforts us'd to draw as many  Merchants  to the  Harbours  of their  Empire  as may settle a continued Commerce with the  Turks  from the respective Nations which they all belong to  The glorious Titles of the  Turks Metropo∣lis  CONSTANTINOPLE  is  to this end  nam'd  The Harbour of the Ʋniverse Throne of Splendour  and  The Seat of Riches  But the common Title which both  Turks  and  Christians  give that City is  The Ottoman Port  and by that Name alone we generally express it  SINCE then their want of Skill in  Maritime Affairs  and the discoun∣tenance of the  Supreme  and  Arbitrary Power  forbid their sending Ships a∣broad let us proceed to see what Foreign Nations condescend to sell the  Manufactures  of their Country in a  Turkish  Market  The  British  Factory at  Constantinople  AND  first  the Trade  we  manage with these People is so great and ad∣vantageous that the Right Worshipful the  Turkey  Company employ a worthy and a numerous  Factory  at  Constantinople  consisting commonly of five or six and twenty Merchants with their Servants and Dependants for whose Protection and Encouragement the  Kings  and  Queens  of  En∣gland  The Antiqui∣ty of the  Tur∣key  Company  since the Reign of  Queen Elizabeth  have still maintain'd some  wise Embassadour  at the  Turkish Court  whose prudent Managements have all along preserv'd a sure Establishment of profitable Commerce and de∣fended both their  Persons Character  and  Factory  from those affrontive In∣solences and audacious Impositions which the haughty Carriage of the  Sultan's Ministers  have often offer'd with success to other Nations  The Factory at  Aleppo  ANOTHER  British Factory  is settled at  Aleppo  under the direction of a  Consul  of our Nation but that City standing far from any Port but  Scanderoon  or  Alexandrietta  a little Town which borders on  Cilicia  and lies in Degrees of  Northern Latitude that  is the Harbour whence the Goods are carried to and from  Aleppo  by the Merchant Ships of  our  and o∣ther Nations  The other at  Smyrna  SMYRNA  has its  Factory  and  Consul  and in some measure Rivals both the other in the richness of its  Traffick  many other Places subject to the  Turk  have their  peculiar Consuls  but are inconsiderable in respect of the aforenam'd Cities and dependant on the Plenipotentiary Authority of the  Embassadour  residing at the  Port  The  Goods  of  British  Manu∣facture com∣monly expor∣ted into  Tur∣key  THE Goods exported to these Wealthy Factors on the Ships be∣longing to the  Turkey  Company are chiefly  Cloath Lead Tin Pewter Li∣nen Coral  and the finest  Iron  all which Merchandices are esteem'd at profitable Rates and turn to good Account if rightly manag'd  Sugar how carry'd thi∣ther  BRITISH  Vessels often sail to  Lisbon  where they take in Cargo's of  Brazil  strong Chested Sugars which they carry on to  Smyrna Scanderoon  or  Constantinople  and dispose of to a Profit sometimes reaching  Cent per Cent  and always near it  Gunpowder a profitable Commodity  GUNPOWDER yields considerable Gain and ever finds a speedy vent the  Turks  not skill'd in making it so well and eagerly ingrossing any Quantity the  Christians  will afford them  Firearms how valued  FIREARMS of all sorts will be sure to meet a ready Purchase and the Musquets of a  strong true British Bore  are so esteem'd in every Part of  Turkey  that they stick at nothing reasonable in the Price provided they are suffer'd to approve their Value by a  Shot  or  two  's Experience  Pitch Tar and Rozin  PITCH Tarr  and  Rozin  are exported thither in considerable Quan∣tities for tho' the Conquests of the  Turks  and Nations  Tributary  to their Government afford far more than they can possibly consume they  not∣withstanding  value that which comes from  Britain  and will barter for it with a double Weight of what they have among them which is often brought again to several Parts of  England  and there dispos'd of at full the Price the first had cost 'em  Clocks and Watches much esteem'd of  ALL sorts of  Clocks  and  Watches  made in  Britain  are in  Turkey  vendible Commodities with many other valuable Merchandices frequently export∣ed into the  Grand Signior  's Country and affording very  large  and  easy  Profit  Goods impor∣ted by the  Turkey  Mer∣chants  THE  British  Merchants in return for these import vast quantities of  Grograms Camlets Tissues Velvets  and  raw Silk  in great abundance fine  Rhubarb Opium Aloes Balm of Gilead Cassia Coffee  and a thousand other  Drugs  of noted Efficacy in  Medicinal  Operations  FINE  Cochineal GumMastick Terra Sigillata Indico  and  Cotton  rich  Sherbets Cavear  and  Carpets  of a noble Size and wrought beyond Com∣parison  Embroider'd Muslins Silks  and  Handkerchiefs  or curious Work∣manship in  Gold  on  Leather  with a number more of such like  Manufactures  profitably pleasant to  industrious Traders  are imported with an unknown Gain from several Harbours of the  Sultan's Empire  Shagreen how made and whence imported  ANOTHER sort of Merchandice imported thence is  Leather  of all sorts  prepar'd  and  unprepar'd  besides which the Country yields great quan∣tities of  SealsSkins GoatsSkins  and the  Wild Ass'sHide  whereof they make the best  Shagreen  in use amongst us  PISTACHES Almonds Dates  dried  Quinces Marmalade  and  Fruits  of all sorts are by Foreign Merchants bought at very  low  and  rea∣sonable Prices  whence transported to the several Ports of  Christian  Coun∣tries they are sold to great advantage  The  Hollan∣ders  Conveni∣ences in tra∣ding with the  Turks  NEXT to the  British Factory  the  Hollanders  maintain the greatest Trade with  Turkey  dealing for the same Commodities but sending  Ships much larger  and at half the Charges they  for the most part  make the best Returns and speediest Voyages  The ungene∣rous Policy of  France  in re∣spect to  Turkey  THE  French  as well as those last nam'd maintain  Embassadours  at  Con∣stantinople  but with this difference that the  first  design thereby no other Interest than their  Factories Prosperity  whereas the  last  have other ends di∣rectly contrary and by preserving a perpetual Amity between their  Mo∣narch  and the  Sultan  endeavour  still  at every favourable Opportunity to stirr that People up to  War  against such Nations as are Enemies to  France  by such  unchristian  Practices imagining to gain some sure Advantage by the great Diversion which the  Turk  must make  invading Christen∣dom  The  Jews  the only Brokers for the  Turkish  Merchants  I have  before  inform'd my Reader that the  Jews  are  Brokers  to the  Tur∣kish Merchants  and indeed on them lies all the management of publick Traffick People fram'd  by Nature  with a  Conscience  and  Capacity  alike en∣dued to cheat the  Ʋniverse  they grow  by these means  soon extreamly Great and Wealthy but the  Turkish Ministers  have learn'd a Lesson how to squeeze a  Grape  when  ripe  and  juicy  to the best advantage  Domestic Trade how carry'd on  THE utmost of their  Foreign Trade  is  now  express'd I  next  proceed to speak of their  Domestic Traffick  which is partly carried on by Coasting Vessels sailing cautiously at little distance from the Shore and partly by the  Caravans  or  Land Conveniencies  which are constantly in motion and ex∣port the  Manufactures  of  one Part  of their Dominions to another  THEIR Navigation  as I have before declar'd  is mean and far inferior to the  Christian  's Skill and  therefore  they are backward in the hazarding Commodities by Sea unless in Trade with  Islands  or a Country they may  reach with ease and safety  How far the  Turks  employ their Ships in Trade  thus they send their Ships to load with Goods from  Cyprus Candy Rhodes  and all the Islands of the  Archipelago  and sometimes venture with considerable Fleets to  Alexandria Scanderoon  and certain other Ports of  Barbary  and  Egypt  The Trade of  Turkey  with the  Euxine  or  BlackSea  THE  Euxine  or  BlackSea  has a peculiar Fleet of Ships appropriated to the Trade the  Turks  maintain with all its Harbours whence they deal for little else but  Timber  and supplies of  Slaves  to serve their Uses which are sold them  annually  by the salvage  Tartars  who in their destructive Ra∣vages and deep Incursions into  Poland Russia Muscovy  and other  bordering Christian Territories  spare nor  Sex  nor  Age  nor  Quality  but carry all in equal Fetters to the  shame  and  torment  of perpetual Slavery  THE  Caravans  of  Turkey  are mistaken generally by the vulgar notions entertain'd among our common People who misled by their affinity of Name with certain  Carriages  in use amongst us think 'em large unweildy  Waggons  which contain a multitude of Passengers  What a  Tur∣kish  Caravan is  whereas the true and genuine meaning of the  Turkish Etymology  is  Haraavahan  that is to say  a mix'd Conveniency  and such are all the  Caravans  of  Turkey  consisting of un∣equal Numbers of assembled  Merchants Travellers  and  Pilgrims  from  Fifty  to an  Hundred Thousand  and so on to sometimes  Fifty Sixty Seven∣ty  or an  Hundred Thousand  Souls  The Order they observe in all their Caravans  OVER these promiscuous Multitudes presides a certain  Officer  distin∣guish'd by the Name of  CaravanBashaw  or  Captain of the Caravan  he con∣stitutes inferiour Officers punishes Disorders regulates Abuses and pre∣serving fix'd  tranquility  and  peace  throughout their Journey guards 'em with a number of selected Soldiers from the scatter'd Parties of  Arabian Horsemen  who are all profess'd  Freebooters  and will oft attack a Number ten times larger than their own and carry off the Merchandice and  Camels  in the  Rear  in spite of all the opposition can be made against them  The method Travellers must take in  Turkey  TRAVELLERS agree with this  commanding Officer  for such a sum of ready Money to be serv'd with  Carriage  and  Provision  if they please for any Journey and by means of these continual motions of the  Caravans  from every corner they are constantly supplied with all the richest Pro∣ducts of their distant Manufactures and the finest  Jewels Porcelane  and the rest of the  Commodities  abounding in the most remote Divisions of  EastIndia Persia China  or the  Aromatic  Confines of  Arabia Felix  The  Turks  ex∣act great Custom for imported Goods  'TWAS  long  before the  Turks  had learn'd the benefit of making Fo∣reign Goods pay  Custom  of Admission but when once they tasted the Ad∣vantage it might bring them they proceeded to exact such vast unreaso∣nable Sums that  Christian Traders  find themselves oblig'd to raise the for∣mer Prices of their Goods the better to enable them to bear the Impo∣sition  Mechanic Skill divided into ex∣treams  AS for the Skill this People boast in their  Mechanick Professions  it is dif∣ferently  great  or  small  according to the Inclinations of the Natives in  gene∣ral  or  particular Genius  of the  Tradesmen  of that Country  Some Handi∣crafts  fall vastly short of ours in  Britain others  far excel the fam'd  Artificers  of even the most refin'd and celebrated Parts of  Christendom  The  Turks  ex∣cellent at Embroidery  THUS in the Art of  Sowing  or  Embroid'ring  on Leather with a party colour'd Silk or golden Wire they have reach'd so great a pitch of Excellence that not the nicest  Needles  of our most industrious  Housewives  can  by any means  compare with their Perfection  Extreamly ig∣norant in ClockWork and Ingraving  AGAIN in  ClockWork  or the curious Arts of  Cutting  or  Engraving  Metals they are skill'd so poorly that they understand not  good  from  worthless Work  but will  alike  encourage every ignorant and idle  Vagabond  and the accomplish'd Master of the nicest Operation  The  Turkish  art of damasking their Scyme∣tars  THE  Turks  have reach'd peculiar Excellence in  Damasking  their Scy∣metars whereby they do not only  strengthen  but  adorn  the Metal with a fine and  streaky  Substance yielding a delicious Scent and odoriferous Per∣fume surprizingly agreable to such as draw their Weapons  unawares  and suddenly  THERE is a Notion commonly receiv'd but  false  and  groundless  as is well observ'd by  Monsieur Tavernier  in the two hundred and thirtieth Page of his  Persian Travels viz  That all such  Scymetars  are brought from  Damas  or  Damascus  and can no where else be made when it is certain and notorious truth that they are done as well in many other Parts of the  Grand Signior's Empire  An Error in the Assertion of Monsieur  Tavernier  BUT as 'tis difficult  almost beyond surmounting  to avoid asserting some  erroneous Probability  while we zealously endeavour to reform the false Opi∣nions of the Men we speak to so the Author lately mention'd to correct one Error hath produc'd another for to undeceive such People as imagin'd  Steel  was only  damask'd  at  Damascus  he informs his Reader that  Golconda  does alone afford a  Metal  capable of that Impression when it is not only practis'd in the Cities of  Aleppo Smyrna Cairo Constantinople  and an hun∣dred other Parts of  Turkey  but in many Provinces of  Christian Countries  I  my self  once bought a Sword at  Hambourgh  of a  Cutler  who for ten Pence more than his demanded Price both  damask'd  and  perfum'd  it to so high a pitch that it retain'd the Scent for some Years after  The manner of damasking  THIS is done by heating  to a moderate degree  the Metal you wou'd damask and instead of cooling it  as usual  by the dipping it in Water twisting round it a  rough Canvas Towel  purposely permitted  for an hour or two  to lie and soak in  Milk  and  Fountain Water  wherein has been dissolv'd a certain quantity of  Vitriol SalArmoniac  and some other such like Com∣positions  The  Turks  ex∣quisite at ma∣king Bows and Arrows  BOWS and  Arrows  they have learn'd the Art to make with wonderful dexterity and can in  Steel  or  Wood  not only shape them to an exquisite Perfection but contrive them  even for Ʋse  far better and more lasting than the celebrated  Archers  of the  Indian Countries  can pretend to e∣qual  CARPENTERS Joyners Masons Smiths  and other  Artisans  of  Turkey  tho' they are extreamly skill'd in their respective Trades  according to the Customs of the Nations they inhabit  cannot boast that  admirable Genius  which at present shines in the conspicuous Improvements of our  Europaean Arts  but labour hardly under the oppressive weights of Ignorance and Tyranny  Painting ill understood in  Turkey  PAINTING is in  Turkey  little understood because they look on representing any  human Image  or a Being blest with Life as gross Idola∣try and a black abomination in the sight of  God  on which account they have maliciously defac'd unnumber'd Pieces of  Antiquity  by beating off the  Heads  or picking out the  Eyes  of every  painted Figure  or accomplish'd  Sculpture  which they had the  undeserv'd good Fortune  to become the Masters of in their successive  Conquests  Their manner of Painting  HOWEVER some there are who Paint in  Miniature  and represent in  fine  and  lasting Water Colours  great variety of  Fruits  and  Flowers  and sometimes  Landskips  but 'tis rarely known that any can attain a tolerable Skill in the expressive Doctrine of a true Proportion  AND yet they seem ambitious in the search of new Improvements and wou'd gladly reach the  White  they aim at while push'd forward to a vi∣gorous desire of an encrease of Knowledge by the placing as sublime a Value on the Excellence of Art as is express'd by the  Greek Hipparchus  in the following Verses  Life boasts no Blessing more refin'd than  Art  Nor can  kind Heav'n  to Man a loftier Bliss impart  For when  the unexpected Turns of Fate  Has shook  to Ruin  our  securest  State  When dubious War shall all things else destroy  That  stands  unshock'd  and  safe  a  sure  and  lasting  Joy  The Cause of  Turkish  Igno∣rance in Arts  BUT what shall Man presume to say when the  Almighty Justice  of an overruling  Providence  permits a poor and miserable People to continue groaning under the  resistless  Torments of a servile Bondage to the arbitra∣ry Sway of an  unbounded Monarchy  whose barbarous Policy permits no light of  Learning  to disperse the  Gloom  of an  encourag'd Ignorance  BEFORE I end the Chapter I am  now  upon I will propose a  use∣ful  and an  easy  way of Gain to any who had rather  hazard  and  fatigue  their Persons by embracing such a Prospect as will give them more than hopes of great Advantages than sit  contentedly  in idle  Shame  and  Poverty at Home  indulging the deficiencies of blinded Reason by a long neglect of active Industry  A usefull Pro∣ject for a skill∣full Brewer  LONDON  contains an unknown number of ingenious  Brewers  who for want of Stock to carry on a creditable Trade are forc'd to live in mean Conditions Servants to the  wealthier  and more  thriving  Brothers of the same Profession Let such as these consider well their present Circum∣stances and learn by what I now proceed to treat of how they may im∣prove them  BRANDY  Wine  and all strong Liquors known in  Turkey  are un∣lawfull to their Use by the aforesaid Prohibition of their  Prophet Mahomet  yet are these People so inclin'd to drinking that  for want of other pleasing Be∣verages  they will often venture publick Scandal and severest Punishments to satisfie the Call of their insatiate Appetites by drinking  Wine  in such prodigious quantities that I forbear to mention what  my Eyes  have often witness'd lest it shou'd  with difficulty  gain belief  NOW this excessive love of  Wine  proceeds from nothing else but their  complain'dof  Ignorance in Brewing other Liquors  The  Turks  ex∣treamly fond of  English  Beer  for I frequently ob∣serv'd that when an  English  Ship had brought some Bottles of our Country  Beer  or  Ale  to  Turkey  and presented 'em to such as afterwards wou'd com∣pliment the noted  Turks  of their Acquaintance with a share in drinking them they constantly express'd a wonderfull Esteem and eager Inclination to obtain a Quantity assuring us  repeatedly  that cou'd they make such  Drink  themselves they never shou'd be tempted to commit a Sin by breaking thro' their  Prophet's Order  to forbear the Use of  Wine  and  Brandy  NOTHING can be possibly more easily accomplish'd than the uni∣versal Wish of  Turks  and  Graecians  upon this occasion wou'd some  En∣glish Brewer  skill'd in his Profession make a Voyage into  Turkey  purposely to use his best endeavours for the introducing common use of  Beer  or  Ale  instead of Water  FOR first I have sufficiently explain'd my Reasons to believe the Na∣tives of that Country wou'd  with pleasure  drink it and the Price by no means cou'd retard the Practice  Malt incredi∣bly Cheap in  Turkey  for so cheap is  Malt  throughout their  Empire  that they feed their  poorest Horses  with the best of Barley and with so much ease might he expect to thrive herein that tho' he sold the Liquor he shou'd brew at not so great a Price as a  Quart a Penny  he must soon grow rich by more than  Cent per Cent  clear Profit in his Dealings  BUT so far beyond this lowest computation may he reckon his Ad∣vantage that I can  experimentally  assure him he might sell it and be ne∣ver thought too dear at full the Price it bears in  London  nor wou'd the  Turks  think  more  too much or if they shou'd the very  Factory  it self ex∣cluding all the other  Christians  there residing wou'd enrich him spee∣dily provided he took care to  manage well  the brewing  all his Liquors  Some Ob∣jections an∣swer'd  IF any timorous Man objects the Inconvenience of so long a Voyage his being altogether unacquainted with the  Country  and its  Language  and his want of  Friends  to help on his Design those difficulties soon will vanish when I tell him he may bargain for his Passage on an  English Ship  and be supplied with all Provisions  even to Constantinople  for considerably less than  twenty Pounds  that he will land within a few Stones throws of the  Em∣bassadours House  to whom the  Captain  must of course present him if de∣sign'd to settle  there  that he is bound to grant him his  Protection  and  En∣couragement  that he may have a  Druggerman  or an  Interpreter  to wait upon him for a little Charge and still conversing with his  Countrymen  maintain a  Trade  almost as free and  uncontroul'd  as if in  England  The probabi∣lity of the Projects meet∣ing with suc∣cess  I beg the  Reader  's pardon  now  and shou'd  before  have beg'd his Patience for this long digression but have said thus much to tempt the Inclinations of some more sprightly Men than ordinary to attempt a Project that can  no ways  hurt them but can boast of more than single probability to advance their  Fortunes  If it does the Good for which it is intended I am fully sa∣tisfied if none believe it worth their while to put in Practice I shall still remain  alike contented  Why the  Turks  are more deficient in the point of Trade than we  I have said as much of both their  Foreign  and  Domestick Trade  as either Subject will afford and if you think it not proportionable to that  mighty Bulk  and  farextended  Power of their arbitrary Government consider them as People altogether strangers to the peaceful Practices of  correspondent Justice  a Nation built on  Ruin  and the  Sword  and  in its rude Original  entirely void of  Honesty  and  Commerce  If then this great unweildy Body has of late descended to the thoughts of  Traffick  you must look upon it only as a  Branch  of their  prodigious Oak  and consequently flourishing in far less  bright  and  e∣mulative Splendour  than our  Christian Arts of Trade and Navigation  which are the strong and stately  Trunks  of our more thriving Trees of Profit by whose celebrated Sap and vegetative Juice those spreading Limbs are still supplied and richly nourish'd with a neverfailing and consummate Plenty  CHAP XII Of the  Turkish  Habits  GOVERNMENTS so  absolute  and  tyrannical  as that of  Turkey  give us little reason by the Notions we conceive of their unpo∣lish'd Constitution to expect Examples of a  common Decency  much less  exact Oeconomy  from the untaught and rustical Deport∣ment of their rough Inhabitants  An exemplary Prudence of the  Turks  in point of dress  YET to my great surprize I found the  Turks  in many things  I speak it with concern  more prudent or  at least  more orderly than any part of  Christendom particularly so  in that accomplish'd Regularity observ'd among them in respect to  Dress  you may  with ease  distinguish there the  Mistress  from her  Waiting Maid  and know the  Quality  of any Man you meet by the peculiar Ornaments of his  restrain'd Appearance there  no  Footmen  huff along ridiculously vain as if they wore their Master's  Honour  in the lining of his  Livery  Those look great  among the Turks  who really are so and a mo∣dest Carriage and sincere Humility adorn the  Persons  of the common People  Men oblig'd to dress accor∣ding to their Quality  DRESSES are as Marks whereby to know the Men you meet tho' Strangers to your View and pay the nice  Punctilio  's  of Respect  which are requir'd  from every Quality  to those  above  and those  below  them but the  Head  as commonly esteem'd the noblest Part is always chose to bear the Mark of an injoin'd Distinction nor is it possible to speak  in any reasonable Compass  of the strange Varieties among their Fashions every  Rank  of Men or different  Order  being  more  or  less  distinguish'd from the other by some  answerable  Turn of  Habit  and  Appearance  I proceed to treat  distinctly  of as many as may prove diverting to the  Reader  or deserving of his Notice  The  Turks  observe the Custom of the Ancients in respect of Habit  THE ancient Custom of the  Eastern  Nations who delighted much in  long  and  open Habits  is  to this Day  prevalent among the  Turks  nor do they ever change the Fashion of their Dress esteeming little such as are misled to frequent Alterations of the Cloaths they wear and hating with a  fix'd  and  rancour'd Enmity  the modish Shape of  Christian  Habits asserting that by openly exposing  Legs  and  Thighs  and wearing  Coats  so  short  and  close  we do not only act  immodestly  but by the Follies of a  fond fantastic  and  af∣fected Levity  for which they willfully mistake our  Conge's  and genteel De∣portment entirely rob our selves of that  grave Majesty  which shou'd di∣stinguish  Man  from  other Creatures  The  Mahome∣tan  Lock  THEY shave their Heads as soon as  Circumcis'd  and still continue to renew that Practice through their riper Years permitting only one small Lock to grow upon their Crowns to an uncommon length which being daily  comb'd  and  scented  by the  Barber's Art  is twisted with a neat and won∣derfull dexterity then fast'ned in a  Knot  and suffer'd to remain  unloos'd  beneath their Turbants  The common Notion of it false and groundless  RIDICULOUS and groundless is the common Notion  that the  Turks  expect to be receiv'd by  Mahomet  from  Earth  to  Paradise  their Prophet holding them by the abovenam'd Lock of Hair thence call'd  Maho∣metan  An exemplary Piety of cer∣tain poor and miserable Christians  THEY rather wear it as a  voluntary Mark  of their Profession of his Faith as many  Christians  now inhabiting the miserable Countries of  Bul∣garia Georgia Servia  and  Sclavonia  invent an Art to stain  by application of a certain Juice  the tender Foreheads of their Newborn Children with the Forms of  Crosses  that when afterward  grown up  and subject to the arro∣gance of  Turkish Neighbours  they must keep their Faith  in spite of Persecuti∣on  or expose their Persons to the scorn of  Christians  and be shun'd for∣ever in their base  Apostacy  The shape and substance of the  Turkish  Shirts  THEIR Shirts are form'd alike for Men and Women open in the Sleeves which some Men wear near half Yard broad they make 'em of a sort of  Callico Crape  or  Muslin  without either  Neck  or  Wristband  never suff'ring any Linen to appear when they are dress'd a pair of Drawers tie upon the Shirt of the same Stuff and reaching loosely to their very Ancles  Shacksheers or Drawers  over these they draw their  Britches  call'd  Shacksheers in the Turkish Language  made of  Scarlet  or a  Violet colour'd Cloath  and reaching like the former to the  Instep  where being gather'd at the bottom commonly three quarters round they strongly sow 'em to a sort of Leathern  Houseshooes  soft and yellow and contriv'd exactly to the shape of every Foot these they call  M  sts  which serve  within Doors  while they  sit  or  walk  on their embroidred Carpet  Papooches or their walking Slippers  for they leave at entrance into any House their walking Slippers or  Papooches  made with smooth and yellow  upper Leathers  and the  Sole  extreamly thin but so well beaten that it will resist the  Dirt  or  Water  in their Streets to admiration they are made without the smallest Heel instead of which they use a piece of  Iron  fram'd exactly like a  Horseshooe  they are shap'd like Womens Slippers with a sharp and picked  Toe  and come not half way up the Instep so that by the smoothness of the  outside  of the  inner  and the  inside  of the  outer Shooes  I often kick'd 'em off as I was walking in the Streets nor can a Stranger keep 'em on his Feet till  use  has made 'em easy to his motion  The Inconve∣niencies of wearing 'em  ANOTHER Inconvenience which attends the wearing these abovenam'd Slippers is the custom they have got of leaving 'em without  like Womens Clogs  at every Door they chance to enter so that  often  when I have been present at their stately  Visits Feasts  or  Publick Ceremonies  com∣ing out amidst a Crowd of People I have sometimes found my Slippers chang'd and others  soil'd  and not worth  wearing  left me in their room nay very often have been forc'd to walk thro' all the Dirt with nothing on my Feet but  Mests  which letting in the wet were worse than if I had gone home barefooted  Coaches  are not found in  Turkish Cities  as esteem'd an idle Proof of an  Effeminate Indulgence  The shape of  Turkish  Boots  THEY ride on Horseback with a great delight and wear a sort of  Boots  unable long to keep out Water they are shap'd at bottom like the  Shooe  's above describ'd and made  but weakly  of the same  smooth Leather  reaching to their Knees and large enough to hold  with ease  the numerous  Gathers  of their spacious Britches  Their Wastcoats  A Doublet made of thin strip'd  Silk  or  Stuff  convenient for a Summer wear is form'd without the shortest Sleeves and reaching to the  Hipp  is folded  one side o'er another  and fastned on the left with  Loop  and  Button  Another sort of Wastcoat  OVER this they wear a  Dolamann  or long loose Robe of  Callico  or  Muslin  in the heat of Summer in the Winter made of  Silks  or  Stuffs  em∣broider'd richly or not at all according to the Quality of those who wear 'em These reach like Ladies  Nightgowns  to the Ground of spacious breadth at bottom the Sleeves are close and button at the  Wrist  where they turn back with  Facings  of the same they button also at the  Neck  whence one side sloping o'er the other they are fastned in the same  place  and  manner  with the under  Wastcoat  just now treated of  The richness of their Gir∣dles  THEY bind these  Dolamanns  with Silk or Muslin Girdles of a length sufficient to allow three rounds about the Body after which they tie an artificial double Knot before and twist each overplus within the Girdle to the  right  and  left  the ends of these long Scarfs embroider'd purposely or richly flower'd with Gold and Silver finely intermix'd with  Persian Silks  of various Colours  A sort of Winter Gown to wear in Houses  AT home  in Summer  they have  nothing on besides  still turning up the Corners of their  Dolamann  within their Girdles but  in Winter  most Men in their Houses wear a sort of loose and open  Gown  which reaches to their Knees some lin'd with  Silk  and some with  Furrs  some having open Sleeves and some not any all according to the different Inclinations of the Men who wear 'em  A costly sort of Lining  WHEN they go abroad they let down constantly the Corners of their  Dolomann  and put on  Blue  or  Scarlet  sometimes  Green  long Robes which train upon the Ground lin'd thro' with  Ermin SquirrelsFurr  good  FoxSkins Rats  or  Sables  some of which are very costly and can scarce be bought for  fifteen hundred Dollars  A noble sort of Robe not much unlike the  Roman  Mantle  SOME delight in wearing light and unlin'd Silken Robes not much un∣like the Dress wherein we often see the ancient  Hero  's painted loosely o'er their Armour they are fastned with a  Silver Gold  or  Diamond Clasp  above the Breast thence falling back with admirable Grace and spreading with an hundred airy Folds  wide broad  and  stately  from their Manly Shoulders  The fineness of their Daggers  GLOVES they wear not nor appear with  Scymetars  but when they Travel all the Arms they bear about 'em is the short  Hanjarr  or  Dagger  which I mention'd in the Chapter of their Military Government which being thrust within their  Sash  on the left side thereof does often shine with precious Stones and other rich and splendid Marks of the  Authority  and  Grandeur  of the Man who wears it  The Quality of  Turks  di∣stinguish'd by their  Turbants  THEIR Heads as I have said before distinguishing their Quality are differently dress'd by different degrees of People yet they all affect the wearing  Turbants  some of  Muslin  some of  Silk  and some of  Callico  the various  Colours Forms  and  Magnitudes  whereof contain the Marks of  Splendour  or  Subjection  The  Muftee  wears one bigger than a  Bushel  yet not heavy nor any ways incommodious The  Sultan  wears his somewhat less and differently twisted the  GrandVizier LordTreasurer  and other Officers whether  Civil  or  Military  are each oblig'd to wear a  Turbant  answerable to their Quality  Their several Colours  THE fashionable Colour of these  Turbants  is a spotless  White  tho' they are sometimes worn of  Black Red Yellow  or of any other unmix'd Colour for a strip'd or speckled  Turbant  is a Mark whereby they know a  Christian  who must never wear one of a pure and single Colour Green is the pecu∣liar Property of those  Emir's  or Kindred of their Prophet which I  long  since  spoke of a  Turk  is Punish'd if he dares presume to Wear it on his Head unless Intit'led to it But a  Christian  so offending is without the smallest hopes of Pardon instantly Condemn'd to a Renunciation of his Faith or must assert it by the Trial of a Painfull  Martyrdom  The Dress of common Peo∣ple  THE Meaner sort of People go  BareLeg'd  with Girdles twisted round their Middles and a Dirty Towel wrapt about their Heads or sometimes a small Scarlet  Skullcap  covering their Crown and reaching to the tops of both their Ears which is the only cover that the Ser∣vants Wear throughout all  Turkey  who tho' somewhat better dress'd than are the other common People yet in this Restriction are not much above them  that is  they must not Wear those loose Furr Gowns de∣noting Power but be contented with a tight closebody'd Dress which speaks their Servitude  The Dress of  Turkish  Ladies at home  THEIR Womens Dress  at Home  is just the same in Britches Slip∣pers Shirts and Wastcoats with the Mens before describ'd upon their Heads they Wear a sort of Pastboard like a foursquare Trencher cover'd over with Embroid'red  Muslin  to certain Silver points on whose ex∣treamest Edges their Perfum'd and Scented Hair is fastn'd so that twisted into several Locks and Hanging with a sort of easy Freedom round their Heads adorn'd with  Ribbands Diamonds  and an hundred different sorts of Glitt'ring Stones it gives a gracefull Look and amiable Air to the appearance of the  Turkish Ladies  TIS but very rarely that they go abroad and then to no Place but the publick  Bagnio  's or the  Funeral  or  Marriage  of some  near Relation  but when they do they cover their abovenam'd HeadDress with a  Linen Muffler  which Meeting with another Piece of Black and Shining Silk that hides the upper Part of their Faces nothing but their Eyes and Nose can possibly be seen  THEY hide their Faces in Obedience to the Precepts of their Prophets Law which tells 'em tis unlawfull to discover any of those Beauties God has given them but to their  Husband  or their  Father    Their Dress a∣broad  they Wear abroad a Gown of  Blue  or  ScarletCloath  which Buttons fast be∣fore and Hangs with narrow Sleeves below their Fingers as they Walk they hold the Bottoms of their Gown in their  LeftHand  as low as they can possibly Reach and Swing their  Right  each step they take with a Surprising  Haughtiness  or rather  Gravity  They Die their Nails with certain Drugs which yield a Colour like a  Reddish Yellow  and delight Ex∣treamly in the Richness of their Habits tho' they very seldom gain an Opportunity of showing them  THE  Female Slaves  and Servants of the  Turks  are Veil'd or Muffl'd while about their Business but meanly Dress'd according to the Servi∣tude of their Condition  BUT what I have already spoken of the  Turkish Habits  shall the rather serve in that the Reader may Discover with his Eye the se∣veral Dresses Represented in the  Cutt  hereto Annex'd more fully and particularly than can be comprehended in a Verbal and more dark Description  The  Turks  in all their Cu∣stoms opposite to us  IN every Action of their Lives the  Turks  oppose the  Europaean Customs they  Wear long Cloaths  we  Wear short ones  we in Salutation of a Friend  esteem it Rudeness not to Bow with Head uncover'd  they  Receive that point of Breeding as the greatest and most base Affront  that can be put upon them  we  esteem a bending of the Body  gracefull  and  obliging  they interpret it a mean acknowledgement of our  Inferiority  to him we speak to  they  love  Sadness  and a grave Deportment  we  love  Gayety  and briskness of Behaviour Every thing in short is carryed on di∣rectly opposite to both our  Humours  and our  Customs  whether one or t'o∣ther's Airs of Breeding are the most consistent with that Native Majesty which Man was form'd with must be judg'd by  several Persons several Ways  and whether  they  or  we  are  right  or  wrong  we both believe our own the worthiest Fashion For as the fam'd  Athenian Solon  has it in his  Elegies  The  Cowards  self is brave in his own Eyes  And the most  homely  Wretch will his own  Features  prize  CHAP XIII Of their Wives Concubines Ways of Courtship and Forms of Marriage  THE inimitable  Virgil  was undoubtedly inspir'd with  Love  and  Truth  when he asserted this so oft experienc'd Max∣im  Omnia vincit Amor nos cedamus Amori  Love conquers  all things  to his Pow'r we yield  And  proudly  lose the Day when  Beauty  takes the Field  The Power of Love  THE roughest  Hero  's of the ancient World amidst the dusty Scenes of  War  and  Ruin  red with Blood of undistinguish'd Slaughter and encom∣pass'd round with  Care  and  Danger  often slacken'd Nature's Springs and sinking calmly from the love of Glory let their  Laurels  wither on their Heads and lost the Sense of  Honour  and  Renown  entirely stupified in all their Faculties and slumbring meanly in the  downy Scenes  of this  Le∣thargic Passion  How much that Passion now prevails among the  Turks  EVEN the adamantine Breasts of  Icy Scythia  have admitted  Love  in all its fervour and forgot entirely native roughness by the softening Charms of Female Conversation nay to such excess does that bewitching Passion now prevail among the  Turks  that as if they were not the  Posterity  of such  uneffeminate  and  hardy Ancestors  they frequently neglect the great Affairs of  State  and  Interest  to dally  wantonly  with  favourite Women  and enjoy the lov'd and rapid Transports which attend on their  Caresses  HEREIN  however  they have got the start of  Europaean Lovers  that whereas we languish  long  and  unsuccessfully  for some lov'd Ladies Fa∣vours they enjoy the utmost of their Wishes in a speedy  Consummation  of their forwardest Desires  The Power of  Turkish  Husbands  AGAIN tho' I'll not give my  Country Women  cause of Anger by af∣firming  that  as preferable an Advantage as the former they boast a sort of unconfin'd Authority which makes their  Wives  submissively Obedient but since it ne'er allows that mutual Confidence that  generous free  and  open familiarity  so requisite to make a Marriage truly happy I cannot praise their Policy in robbing Wives of that well tolerated Liberty which serves to soften Matrimonial Bondage and proves a sure and winning Mark of  Conjugal Goodnature  An ancient Saying  IT was the Saying of a very ancient  Graecian  Author    Nature did not frame the Woman to command  And  Philemon  a Poet who flourish'd in the Reign of  Alexander the Great  has left his Noti∣ons of the Matter in the following Lines  A Wife my Friend who takes the wisest way  Shou'd not  command  her Husband but obey  For where a Woman o'er her Consort Reigns  The weight that  gaul'd before  now wounds with killing Pains  AND so entirely do the  Turks  adhere to this Poetic Doctrine that for fear their Wives shou'd  by degrees  encroach on their Prerogative they rob them barbarously of those indifferent Liberties without whose tast 'tis mo∣rally impossible for Man or Woman to be truly happy  Submission and affection of the  Turkish  Wives  THE good Effects of  Turkish Discipline  surpriz'd me much when I perciev'd that notwithstanding their severe Behaviour towards their Wives the  patient Turtles  were so far from less'ning their Affection  on Confinement  that they rather doubled their respect and  Spaniellike  fawn'd humbly on their Injurers with the assurance  Horace  had from  Lydia  Tecum vivere amem tecum obeam libens  With thee dear Soul I cou'd for ever live  My Life  to die with thee  I'd  freely  give  The mistaken Notions of some of our  British  Ladies  IT is a strange amazing  Labyrinth  of Female Wonders to behold the contradictory Inclinations of that  unintelligible Sex  while  those in Turkey  grow goodnatur'd by a brutish Usage  ours in Britain  sometimes think it  out of Fashion  to oblige an  easy Husband  and instead of mending on the Kindness they receive insult the more and make their  Spouses  gentle Con∣descention their undoubted Privilege of Nature  these  speak in rougher Notes than those above and plead like  Juvenal  's unreasonable Woman  Sic volo sic jubeo stat pro ratione voluntas  It shall be so I will 'tis my Command  And  Resolution  shall for  Reason  stand  ENCREASE  and Multiply  is held a very good and necessary Max∣im by the  Turkish Nation  and indeed they lose no time nor opportunity of putting it in execution to the best advantage  Wives Slaves  and  Concu∣bines  promiscuously granted them without controul and every  Tenet  of their  Faith  and  Practice  of their  Lives  combining jointly to indulge their Wishes in the gross Enjoyment of a sensual Appetite  POLYGAMY was by  Mahomet  allow'd them freely and unbounded but the Dictates of their Policy oblig'd 'em to restrain that tolerated Li∣berty and fix a certain  Limit  to that dangerous Privilege for the Reasons following  The Reasons why the  Turks  restrain Poly∣gamy  WERE Men permitted to indulge their Senses in the various Pleasures of promiscuous Embraces they wou'd Marry inconsiderately such a num∣ber of  Wives  that on their Death the  major part  of their Estates devolving to the  Sultan  little wou'd be left to share amongst them and the  helpless Ladies  consequently forc'd to  Want  and  Beggary  ANOTHER Reason and indeed the wisest of the two is this The numerous  Doubts Fears Envies Jealousies  and  Quarrels  which al∣ternately possess a Womans Mind where  Rivals  are respected wou'd by tolerating many Wives become so  frequent formidable  and  ungovern'd  that those  Fairy Pleasures  which invite to  Matrimony  vanishing away wou'd leave behind 'em little else but  Noise  and  Discord Troubles  and  Distraction  How many Wives the  Turks  may Marry  HOWEVER they are yet permitted by the common Custom to espouse four  lawful Wives  and lest their wand'ring Inclinations shou'd in∣duce 'em to believe they were denied a Pleasure  Heaven  design'd 'em they are freely suffer'd to enjoy the Persons of as many  Concubines  or  purchas'd Slaves  as they may think agreable nor are the Children so begot esteem'd in  Turkey  as in  Christian Countries  spurious and illegitimate but equally intit'led to their  Father  's Love and Honour of his Quality with others born in Wedlock  WITH this Proviso notwithstanding are they  Freemen  and  Legitimate  they must be manumitted in a publick Form by  Will  and  Testament  before some  Judge  of Civil Administration  Seal'd Sign'd  and  Given in  by their own  Father  's Hand with solemn Ceremony  A very strange and barbarous Custom  This neglected leaves 'em Servants to their Brother's  Will  who may at pleasure use them as their Bondsmen  O  happy Turks  cries some disconsolate and wretched  British  Husband when he hears me tell him  Turkish Matrimony  is not quite so true a  Gordian Knot  but that 'tis frequently untied without much difficulty yet perhaps were some  Mahometan  his Spouses  Consort  he wou'd find a Blessing which her present Owner either does not  know  or  care  to value  The  Turkish  Marriages not perform'd by Priests  BUT e're we speak of their  Divorces  'twill be proper to describe their Matrimonial Ceremonies and in order thereunto I must acquaint my Reader that the Act of Marriage is perform'd by the appearance of the  Husband  with the  Father Ʋncle Brother  or some near  Relation  of the  Brides  before a  Judge  where in a publick manner he avows his Inclina∣tions and Affections to the Person of the Lady tho' perhaps he never saw one Feature of her Face but that's no matter  Love  you know is painted  blind  and  thence  blind Bargains are become a Fashion  PROCEEDED this large Step on his intended Journey he is  next  demanded by the  Judge  what offers he can make deserving her Acceptance Settlements are made according to his Circumstances or the fetter'd Pri∣vileges of  Turkish Subjects  and the  Bridegroom  signing  there  an Instrument whereby he owns her for his lawfull Wife the  Match  is ent'red in a publick  Register  and ever after they are  conjugally coupled  How the Man employs the Night before  NOW then let's venture to observe the Consequences of this previous Ceremony after which the Man  transported to be sure and full of Raptures  takes his own and halfgain'd Spouses  Male Relations  to his own Appart∣ment where he entertains them till within an Hour of Midnight with the fashionable Musick  Vocal  and  Instrumental Coffee  and  Sherbet  and if of brisk and airy Constitutions sometimes treats 'em with a glass of Wine but very sparingly for fear of Reprehension  How 'tis em∣ploy'd by the Women  BUT as for the poor Female Victim who is trembling all this while with dreadfull apprehensions of some near Surprize she sits  unveil'd  on an embroid'red Cushion in the midst of a large Room round which are plac'd her  SheAcquaintance Friends  and  Kinsfolks  all invited by her Mo∣ther  if she has one  to inform her what she is about to do and read alter∣nately repeated Lectures of the Duty of a  Wife  and Power of her  Hus∣band  while the poor  halffrighted  Creature stares about her with a blush∣ing Ignorance  amaz'd  and quite  confounded  with their  Monitory Lessons  THUS they pass away the time till almost Midnight when they take the  Bride  with one consent and lead her to the  Bagnio  if there is one in the House  if not  a common  Bathing Tub  will serve the turn  Here  every  Gossip  plucks a Feather till having quite undress'd the  helpless Virgin  they begin to  wash  and  rub  her soundly smoothing o'er her Body with a certain  scented  and  balsamick Oyntment  the better to prepare her for approaching Pleasures after this they put her on a Shift and wrapping NightGown thence conducting her to take her Rest till early the next Morning  The Morning Ceremony  AT the dawning of the Day they come again to wake the Bride who rising from the last Possession of her  Virgin Pillow  is by them attended with officious Ceremony dress'd in all her richest Robes and soon made ready for the amorous Call of her expected Husband  HE is not tedious  we'll suppose  in dressing but with all the Friends he entertain'd the Night before sets forward from his House well mounted and attended by a gallant Troop of Gentlemen on Horseback Serenaded as they go by several sorts of Musick sounding with them thro' the Streets They come at last where lives  the Bride  whose Father summon'd by the noisy Instruments commands his Door to be set wide open and demands within it  what they want  and  why they visit him  The manner of the Bride∣groom's com∣ing to de∣mand his Wife  THE Bridegroom answers sitting on his Horse  he comes to claim the lovely Jewel  God  has given him  and names her with a loud and haughty Voice and being further ask'd  how well he can defend her  he lays his Hand directly on his Scymetar and draws it half way from the Scabbard every Horseman in the Company proceeding to the same Expression of his Friendship to the Married Couple hereupon the Father stepping from his Door advances slowly some few Paces to salute the  Bridegroom  who with all his Followers dismounting nimbly lays his Hand devoutly on his Breast and utters this Expression  True Happiness this Moment blesses me  to which the  Father  answers heartily  O may that Happiness be great and lasting  How the Bridegroom is receiv'd at his Fatherinlaws House  THE Bridegroom enters full of Joy and with his Father flies up Stairs as nimbly as he can his Friends mean while conducted in and en∣tertain'd  below  according to the  Turkish Fashion  at the entrance of the Wo∣mens Chamber he is met by the expecting  Bride  her Mother and Relati∣ons  she unvail'd  and aiming all her Beauties to surprize his Fancy en∣t'ring he extends his Arms with wonder and astonishment and  doubt∣less overwhelm'd with Rays of brightness  finds himself unable to sustain the Shock and therefore turns him round with great Humility in order to e∣scape the danger of his Spouses Lightning  How the Bride receives him  BUT the tender natur'd Nymph unwilling to confound at first Ap∣pearance calls him back with gentle Phrases and the mild Expression of  Gehl Giacquir bennum  that is to say  Return my good Angel  this encou∣ragement removes all fear and tempts him forward till his newmade  Consort  takes him by the Hand and leads him to a Table little higher than the Ground she seats him crossleg'd there upon a fine embroid'red Cushion and sits down herself in the same Posture  opposite  to him all the Company  then  place themselves on Cushions six Foot distant from the  ogling  Spouses till they form a fine and spacious Circle round the Table  His Entertain∣ment  SMILES and Glances and the common Airs of meeting Lovers pass the Time till there is brought upon the Board betwixt them two small Dishes one containing a fat  roasted Dove  the other fill'd with certain  Cakes  not much unlike our Barly Sugar  Emblematical Proceedings of the married People  THE Dove is cut in four  distinct  Pieces whereof the  Head  and  Neck  make  one  the  Rump  the second and the  Body  slit in two composes both the other The  Bridegroom first  presents his Lady with the  Rump  and this Expression  Tho' lowest yet acceptable  The  Bride  returns her Consorts Compliment by giving him the  Head  with this submissive  Motto Be thou my Head and I thy Footstool  THEN put they both their Hands  together  on the Table taking  each  one half of the divided  Pidgeon which  denotes that they shou'd live  like harmless Turtles  and that tho' the  Head  and  Tail  make some distinction yet they ought to love and prize each other as two diff'rent Parts of one sole Body  THIS done the  Bride  extends her Hand and reaching from the other Plate a piece of the abovenam'd  BarleySugar  directs her Fingers to her  Husband  's Mouth and makes him swallow it  he  does the same to her a∣gain by this expression of their silent Will declaring  mutually  that it shall be always  eithers  chief endeavour to oblige the other by a constant practice of the sweetest Carriage and most tender Actions which can prove  Af∣fection  A drinking Emblem  THEY  next  proceed to call for Drink which presently is brought 'em in a  ChinaCup  containing  fine perfum'd Sherbet  of costly Preparation  First  the  Husband  sips and  then  the  Wife  which having done they joint∣ly lay their Hands upon the Cup and spill the Liquor on the Table which is thereupon remov'd immediately This  Emblem  signifies that they must always join with sympathetical  Concern  or  Joy  and  gain  or  lose  the Plea∣sures of this Life with equal satisfaction  AFTER all these Ceremonies are perform'd the  Bridegroom  takes his leave and goes away to his own House in order to prepare for the Noctur∣nal Entertainment of his charming  Wife  who  in the close of Evening  is at∣tended to his Place of Habitation in the following manner  In what man∣ner the Bride is carried to her Husbands House  THE  Bridegrooms  Brother or the nearest of his Kindred claims the Lady in her Husbands Name who is deliver'd into his Possession Veil'd all over mounted  like an Amazonian Heroine  astride on Horse∣back and Attended by a Stately number of her Female Friends who Ride about her and Support a sort of  Indian Canopy  which falling like a Tent below her Horses Breast becomes a perfect  Cover  and pre∣vents her being seen by any of the People who will always Crowd the Streets on those occasions round this shining Troop of Ladies Ride a greater number of the Male Acquaintance of both Parties who serve alike to grace the  Cavalcade  and Guard the Women from the Insolent Abuses of the common People  How she is re∣ceiv'd there  ARRIV'D at last the Waiting  Bridegroom  standing in his Door Receives his Consort  open Arm'd  and leads her Instantly to some pre∣par'd  Appartment  where their Numerous Men Relations who Assisted in the Ceremony enter  One by One  according to their Quality and having  each  bestow'd some Present answerable to his Circumstances they with∣draw  genteely  with repeated wishes for a happy Bedding of the Amo∣rous Pair returning every Man to his particular Place of Habitation  The Pastimes of the Wo∣men  THE Women to divert the Husband and his Bride begin to Dance at which Profession they are Skill'd but  Aukwardly  performing always Singly and Inventing  Strange  and frequently  Lascivious  Postures to adorn their Motion and Excite an ardent Flame of  Expectation  or to call it by its right Name  Lust  in the  alreadykindled  Fires which Warm the Breast of the Impatient Lovers  The previous Ceremonies to the Bedding  BUT now the  time  which ever Rolls along with heavy Wheels on such occasions Summons them to hasten the usual Preparations for the  Bridal Bed  in order whereunto they lead the  Bride  with Songs and Musick to the Chamber which contains the stately Scene of her expected Pleasures here they Place her on a small Square Block all cover'd oer with  Silk  or  Velvet  and retiring to the distant Corners of the Room Invite the Husband to the Comical performance of a Merry Duty  Fashionably Incumbent  on new Married People  NO Pulling off the  Bridal Garters Throwing the Stocking  or other common Practices in use at  British Weddings  are observ'd among the  Turks  but sure the Reader will allow the  Turkish Bridegroom  has a Task far more Diverting Strange and Comical  A Comical Injunction on the  Turkish  Bridegrooms  FOR he is  First  oblig'd to be his Spouses  Valet  and Undress her for his Bed nor is this odd Injunction all is he oblig'd to for the Young and Airy  Turkish Ladies  who delight in Dressing a new Married Friend con∣trive such Strange and Artful  Knots  about the Silken strings which Tye her Drawers that 'tis next to a downright Impossibility to find out gen∣tle means to loosen them yet the  Eager Bridegroom  is Injoyn'd to kneel and Fumble  with his Teeth  till he can some way or other get them open which the Young and Vigorous Lovers all Impatient of delay with violent endeavours bite Asunder none in such a Case must use the least Assistance either of their own or Spouses Fingers so that were there  Men  as well as  Women  present at this Ceremony they would doubt∣less find themselves far more Diverted than the Merryest Company that ever grac'd a  Christian Wedding  IT would  it is presum'd  be altogether needless to Instruct the  Male  or  Female  Reader in the well known consequences of these Preparatory Pastimes since the common knowledge of both  Turks  and  Christians  will  direct their Fancy's to a full Discovery of these secret Practices whic  eithers  Modesty  will constantly incline their Will to draw a Curtain over  to leave them  undisturb'd  and  private  AND now since I am treating of the Lover's fond  Elyzium  'twil  not be improper to observe that those bewitching Joys are sometime  frustrated and lessen'd very commonly by the Jealousy or Malice of  som  other Wife  transported with the fear of Scorn at the appearance of a Riva  in her Lord's Affections  Witchcraft ve∣ry common a∣mong the  Tur∣kish  Women  IN  Turkey  nothing is more frequent than a deep and cursed Knowledge in the Practices of  Witchcraft Sorcery  and a sort of  jugling Villany  where∣by they render  impotent  and  ineffectual  the strongest Efforts of a vigorous Lover on his  Wedding Night  and 'tis perhaps to this the  Turkish Matri∣mony  tho' indulg'd in  Polygamy  owes the common and amazing  paucity  of Children  NAY so skill'd are many in this  damnable  Profession that they inso∣lently dare pretend to force Affection from Antipathy it self to punish In∣fidelity in Affairs of Love and give a Lady supernatural Charms to change her humble Servant's vow'd Inconstancy  The Practice very ancient among the  Greeks  NOR do we find such Practices of Modern Date the  ancient Greece  was famous for this Study which they had  Originally  with their worthier Knowledge from  that Source of Learning Egypt  How skill'd the  Grecian Ladies  were in  Magic Incantations  may be gather'd plainly from  Simaetha  's Words to her Maid  Thestylis  in the second  Eidyll  of  Theocritus  where she endeavours to bring back  Delphis  who had abandon'd her Affe∣ctions  Part of the d Eidyll of  Theocritus  Where are my Laurels  Thestylis  And where  The pow'rfull  Philtres  we must now prepare  This sacred Cup with  purple Fleeces  bind  That tho' my  fickle Lover  proves unkind  I may some  Magic Incantations  use  And force him to a Breast he would not chuse  Since he  ungratefull  went twelve Days are fled  Nor knows he whether w'are alive or dead  AND a little further in the following Words begins her Incantation  With all the  Sacred Charms  of  Magic Art  I'll now inchant the  lov'd Inconstant  's Heart  But thou  O Moon  shed favourable Rays  For grateful I to thee address my Lays  To thee  O Goddess  and to  Hecate  The pow'rfull subterraneous Deity  At whose Appearance Curs forget to bark  And silent let thee  Stalk  thro' dreadful Dark  Whilst  o'er the Graves  at Noon of Night you tread  And press the  clotted Blood  of the  corrupted Dead  Hail  awfull  Hecate hail  Goddess  hail  Grant me thy AidSo shall my Charms prevail  Go  Iynx  go  kind Spirit  hast away  And  drag  him to my House without the least delay  Another sort of Sorcery  THERE is another sort of Sorcery much us'd in  Turkey  if it may be call'd so since perhaps the Notion took its rise from nothing but the super∣stitious Fancies and ridiculous Opinions of  Hypocondriacal  Persons they call it  Magic of the Eye  or the bewitching by an evil Look now whether there are any real grounds for this Belief I shall not venture to determine  A Story of a Gentleman bewitch'd by an evil Eye  But this I can assure my Reader that I knew a Gentleman at  Constantinople  who was naturally blest with an uncommon Share of Wit and Judgment yet became a downright  Idiot  in the space of twenty four Hours upon go∣ing by the Invitation of a  Greek  of his Acquaintance to make one among the Guests at an  Armenian Wedding  and it was believ'd in Town by every Man who heard the Story that the Evil Eye of  one there present  had depriv'd him of his Senses  Another sort of Marriage us'd in  Turkey  THERE is  among the Turks  another sort of  Marriage  generally us'd by Strangers who reside but little time in any City this is call'd  Hakabin  and is a Bargain made before a  Judge  whereby the Man is bound to take the Woman and maintain her as his Wife for  one two six  or more Months and when his Business calls him to another Place he is oblig'd to give her such a  Sum of Money  as is mention'd in their first Agree∣ment  Concubinage how tole∣rated  CONCUBINAGE  as I have said before  is granted to the  Turks  who always keep as many  Slaves  as they can purchase and maintain to serve  by Day  the Uses of the House and  all Night long  the Pleasures of their Master  THERE is in  Constantinople  a  SlaveMarket twice  or  thrice  a Week thither the People go and see the miserable  Christian CaptiveVirgins  dress'd in all the tempting Ornaments that can allure the Looks of  amorous Passen∣gers  they speak to those they are inclin'd to like and having ask'd them any Questions they think fit to start they feel their  Breasts Hands Cheeks  and  Foreheads    A curious Search  nay proceed if curious in the nicety of Search to have the young and wretched Creatures taken privately to some convenient Place where  undisturb'd  and  free  to use the utmost of their Will they find out certain subtle Means of boasted Efficacy to discover instantly by  Proofs  and  Demonstration  whether the  pretended Virgin  has  as yet  been rob'd of that so celebrated  Jewel  she affirms her self Possessor of  THE Slaves they buy they carry home and use as is  abovedeclar'd  till growing weary of their  Persons  and  Embraces  they have liberty again to sell them to some  Friend  or  Neighbour  taking others to their changeable Affections nor are  their Wives  at all disturb'd to see them use this tolerated  Freedom    The  Turkish  Wives may claim one Night in seven  Custom's tyranny has made them humble none complaining of her Husband's slight provided he bestows  one  Night in  seven  in her  conju∣gal Caresses that  the  Law  has given them as their  unquestion'd Property  and will oblige the Man to own it as his Duty  The  Turks  no∣tion of Cuck∣oldom more Reasonable than ours  AN Honest and an Admirable Notion sways the Judgments of the  Turkish People  in the Point of  Cuckoldom  for that which  here with us  is strangely look'd upon as  the Husbands shame  is  in their Country  plac'd more Wisely and with  Justice  on the  Lewd Adultress  and her  Hornified  Rela∣tions for where the Husband finds his Bed Dishonour'd and Polluted he Applies himself  directly  to some  Judge  or  Governour  and sitting forth  at large  the Cause of his Complaint obtains relief by an Immediate Or∣der of  Divorce  and free's himself  at once  from  Wife  and  Scandal  Why the  Turk∣ish Sultan  's must not Mar∣ry  THE  Turkish Sultan  's must not Marry or it is become a Politic O∣mission to forbear so doing  First  in that 'twou'd cause  Alliances  and dist∣ant  Kindred  to their  Royal Family  a thing they always  Fear'd  and  Hated  and  Secondly  because the  Greatest  and most Unexpected turns of  Fate  shall never wound the  Princes Honour  in obliging him to see a  Wife  become the  Victim  of Licentious Insolence and he himself an helpless  Witness  of her shameful Usage  The Original of the Cu∣stom  BAJAZET  an  Ancient  but  Ʋnhappy Emperour  by dear Experience taught 'em this for when the  brave Victorious Tamherlane the Great  had won the Battle which reduc'd him to his Misery his Wife  Dehespeena  whom he dearly Lov'd and in whose Blessings  his  were  Centr'ed  being taken  Prisoner  was before the Face of her distracted Husband Ravish'd by the  Conquerour  The Unsupported sorrow which the  Haughty Turk  con∣ceiv'd hereat shook all his  Patience  into  Madness  and produc'd that Rough and  Melancholy Death  which put an End to all his Sufferings  THE  Princes  who succeded  Bajazet  resolving  for the Future  to a∣void so black and piercing a Misfortune made a Law that none shou'd Marry  ever after  on the Throne of  Turkey  which has been observ'd with such Religious constancy that two late  Emperours  have been depos'd and little urg'd against their Governments but that they took the Liberty of  Marriage  and thereby Infring'd the solemn Prohibition of their Wiser  Predecessors  Four sorts of Divorces us'd among them  I spoke just now of their  Divorces  and will here Describe Four several Methods now in use whereby the  Turks with ease  Untye the strongest Cord which joyns their  Matrimony  The First  THE First is Registred before a  Judge  as are  Indeed  the other Three by this the  Man and Wife  are only separated  either free  and altogether Independant on the others Power  here  the Husband is oblig'd to settle a sufficient  Maintenance  and keep her separate as well as when they Liv'd  together  The Second  THE Second kind of separation is a Wider breach of  conjugal Con∣junction  for they  then  are left entirely to their Liberty and as by  joint con∣sent  they may return again to one anothers Arms so may they also Mar∣ry  at their Pleasure  any other Person who shall best agree with either of their Circumstances  The Third Di∣vorce in Case of Impotence  THE Third Divorce now Practis'd by the  Turks  is when a Wo∣man is unfortunately Married to a Man unqualified for satisfaction of her Warm desires by the  Natural  Misfortune of an  Impotent Frigidity  in such a Case the  Man  refusing to discharge his  Wife  is Summon'd  by her Friends  before a  Judge  and forc'd to bring her with him to the same Appearance when the Charge is Read against him she is ask'd if she will  then  affirm the Truth of all that Accusation hereupon she Stoops and taking off her Slipper Spits upon the Sole and Strikes it  on her  Husband's Forehead  Modesty requires no further Confirmation from a  Female Plantiff  and the Sentence is immediately pronounc'd  in favour of the Lady  who is  thenceforth  free to Marry as she pleases and intitled  not∣withstanding  to a large  Allowance  from her  former Consort  's yearly In∣come  NOR is it hard that  Women  shou'd be favour'd in a case so reasonable when it is the only  Plea  they have for gaining a  Divorce  while  on the con∣trary  the Men possess a thousand great and boundless Privileges and are at any time enabled to obtain Releases from their  Matrimonial Chain  on e∣very  mean  and  slight Occasion  A very merry kind of Pra∣ctice for the Punishment of Levity  BUT the most diverting sort of a  Divorce  that e'er was heard of is the  Oochey Tahalac  which having  once  disjoin'd a Pair permits no second thoughts or change of Inclination so as to be  reconcil'd again  till as a Pu∣nishment for his  ridiculous  and  fickle Humour  the repenting Husband will contentedly stand by and see his  Wife in open Day  enjoy'd before his face by some brisk Stranger who is led by accident to pass the House where they expect  impatiently  the first fair Comer  A pleasant Passage hap'ning some Years since at  Constantinople  will afford an  entertaining  and  compleat Idea  of this humorous Custom it fell out as follows  A pleasant Story of the Master of an  English  Vessel  THE Master of an  English Merchant Ship  who understood but little  Turkish  scarce enough to buy an  Orange  as he walk'd the Streets wou'd needs be vent'ring frequently  on Shoar  sometimes  with Company  and some∣times  without  well dress'd with  Turbant Dolamann  and every other part of Habit  in the Turkish Fashion  he was often caution'd of the Dangers he might fall into but never list'ned to his Friends Advice returning always safely to his Ship without the least Affront or meeting any who ac∣costed him in the Country Language  BUT rambling  on a certain Day  about the City he was beck'ned to by several  Turks  who stood  together  at the entrance of a House surpriz'd at first he wou'd have pass'd 'em slowly by as if he took no notice of their Summons but before he got five Yards beyond the Door he felt himself  pull'd back  by one who  smiling  spoke a  long  and  speedy Sentence  and retur∣ning towards the Door he came from dragg'd him  as it were by force  to fol∣low him  THE Master understood not one small  Syllable  of what he said but went as he was led without so much as speaking all the way till coming to the Door the other Company began to laugh and talk with eagerness as if they were informing him of something very pleasant and diverting he seem'd to listen with a wonderfull attention and to cloak the matter laugh'd for Company but durst not speak for fear of a Discovery he  then  began to curse his forwardness and  Turkish Habit  and to wish himself  secure  on board his Ship resolving to attempt no more such  single Wander∣ings  A comical Surprize  MEAN while the  Turks  had led him forward and conducted him to a large Chamber on the  elevated Floor  whereof there lay a  Bed  with  Quilt  and  Mattress  after the Fashion of the Country upon the Bed sat  crossleg'd  a genteel young Lady gay and beautifull with Face  unveil'd  and sprightly Countenance who blush'd at his appearance on a  Cushion  not far distant sat a grave  Kaddee  or  Judge  the Master of the House and in a corner of the Room stood  leaning  and  disconsolate  a wellmade  Turk  who  by the sequel  prov'd to be the Husband of  the Lady on the Bed  and standing  there  to be  Spectator  of a Duty he wou'd rather have ex∣cus'd  A very doubt∣full State  THE Company withdrew at the approach of the Master leaving none behind but the  young Lady  and her  Husband  smiling as they pass'd him by and pulling to the Door to keep them private 'Tis not difficult to guess the wonder which amus'd his thoughts at such an  odd  and unexpected Ac∣cident he star'd about him like a Man distracted ignorant what he was to do and fearing  every Moment  some Design which he conceiv'd was form'd against him  AT last the  Husband  looking roughly towards him spoke a few low Words which  by the accent  seem'd uneasy and with  a nod or two  and  mo∣tion of his Hand  made Signs that he shou'd do the Duty he was call'd to without delay the Lady  likewise  beck'ned with her Finger and repeated often these Words  Gehl Adham Gehl  that is  Come Man come  he under∣stood  so much  but no ways apprehending what they meant by those ex∣pressive Motions instead of answering their repeated Invitations  stood still  and gaz'd about with mute  Astonishment  THE Husband half amaz'd to see his Silence and fix'd Posture as al∣so eager  since he knew it must be done  to have it over came grimly up and pushing him with anger  forward  cried out aloud  Geddi Brai Boc Kahdin  that is  Go Fool see the Lady  But the frighted  Britain  all surpriz'd at this new step was so confounded with the turns of the  amazing Accident  that scarce rememb'ring  who  or  where  he was he forc'd himself with fury from the  Turk  and in the  English Tongue  cried out  Why in the Devil's Name d'ye push me thus I know not what you wou'd be at nor understand one Word you say to me  An odd dis∣covery  THE shock'd  Mahometan  with all imaginable wonder started back to hear him speak an unknown Language and snatching off his  Turbant  pre∣sently discover'd him a  Christian  by the manner of his being shav'd and  pointing to his Head  cry'd loudly to his Wife  Vollah Boo Adham Gaour By the Lord this Man's an Infidel  With that he drew his Dagger from his Gir∣dle and his  Wife  began in passion to rise up and fall upon the  Master  when the  Turk  bethought him of a cunning Stratagem to save his Honour and having given the  English Man  his  Turbant  back again endeavour'd  partly by fair Words  and  partly by his Signs  to make him understand he shou'd go out as silently as he came in and seem to smile as if he had been pleas'd with his Adventure  THE trembling Master glad of any opportunity to get away from such a dangerous Scene of Wonders made abundance of expressive moti∣ons with his  Head  and  Hands  to thank him for his kindness and was marching off with counterfeited Smiles upon his Face when all the Com∣pany still waiting in the outward Room began to gather round him and to ask him if he had been satisfied in his  goodfortune  he answer'd as the  Husband  had made shift to teach him  Hevett Sultanum  that is  Yes noble Sir  A merry Acti∣on of a  Tur∣kish  Lady  But the expecting Wife who had  it seems  been baulk'd of her Desire and was unwilling tho' she lost the  Christian's Kindness  to deprive her self of some more qualified Person's follow'd to the Door and cried out  Yoketer  that is  he lies  as loud as she was able  THIS alarm'd the  Judge  and all the  rest  and made the  Husband  hang his Head like one condemn'd to  Stocks  or  Whipping Post  in short they seiz'd upon the  poor discover'd  Master and began to drag him back to do the  Duty they expected from him He  unwilling to comply with their desires  en∣deavour'd by continued Strugling to break loose and get away till in the  Scuffling  he again let Fall his  Turbant  and with much ado escaping from their hold ran swiftly thro' the Street while all the  Boys  he pass'd by seeing him disorder'd and Bareheaded and  besides  A Fortunate escape  Alarm'd by the repeated ex∣clamations of the  Turks  he broke away from who Cried out  an Infidel an Infidel  as loud as they were able gather'd round him and with  Dirt  and  Stones  pursued him thro' the City till he came upon the Water side and found among the rest some  Janizaries  whom he knew and whose Au∣thority protected him from further Injury  I cannot say what Second  Spark  the Lady found to serve her turn or how the Business was perform'd among them but the  Masters  ill success in this last Ramble prov'd more Efficacious to disswade him from such bold attempts in future Voyages than all the  Good Advice  and  Solid Doctrine  which had been  before  in vain bestow'd upon his  rash  and  Inconsiderate Obstinacy  I promis'd in the Title of this Chapter to say a little of the  Turkish ways of Courtship  and will now proceed to let the  Reader  know as much of their  Amours  and Gallantry as fell occasionally within the Compass of my Ob∣servation  No coming in∣to Womens Company in  Turkey  THERE is no such thing in  Turkey  as a Publick Meeting and pro∣miscuous Conversation of  Sexes  at the  Park Ring Balls  or  Theatre  or any other tolerated Scene of Honourable Liberty all are  Grave Reserv'd  and  Solitary  Women seldom stirr abroad  before  or  after Marriage  and as there is never found the Smallest Opportunity of  seeing  or  Conversing with  the  Ladies Love  is consequently quite a Stranger to their Warmest Inclinati∣ons till they have obtain'd an  object  whereupon to Build it yet there Flames amongst the  Youth  of this Licentious Nation such a Raging Passion of  Desire  that they employ the Wishes of their  earliest Man∣hood  how to get a  Wife  or  two  to pass their time with and apply themselves  accordingly  to those allow'd and fashionable means whereby tho' Blindfold they may gain a  Mistriss  Matches made by Friends  THEIR common Custom  then  in such like Cases is to listen to their Friends Proposals such a  Man  has such a  Daughter Neice  or  Sister  so and so possess'd of  Beauty  and  good Humour Fortune  they expect none with a  Wife  in  Turkey  for the Husband  there  must buy her Person with a settled Sum according to her  Value  which they seldom hold at Mighty Rates or the agreement made between the Parents of the willing Couple  A Pig in a Poke  THE  Fathers word  is sometimes taken for the  Daughters Merit  and the  Bridegroom  signs the Articles of Marriage before he is admitted to a sight of his Beloved But the  Brisk  and  Wiser  sort of  Gentlemen  will seldom make so blind a Bargain and refuse to listen to the smallest motion of a  Matrimonial Treaty  till they are convinc'd by  Ocular Experience  that the  Mistriss  offer'd them is really as deserving in her Person as they speak her in her Character  The  Turkish  Custom in case of Rivals  IT sometimes happens that  two Rivals  Jarr about  one Lady  and in such a Case the  Parents  of the  Virgin  will not Interpose their Counsel nor Au∣thority but by the following Method bring the  Lovers  to her sight and let her choice decide the matter they are  both  appointed at a certain time to meet beneath the Window of a Chamber of the House she lives in  Lettic'd over  so that nothing can be seen within the Room but those who stand within can easily perceive whatever passes in the Court before it Here is  plac'd the  Mistriss  of their hopes who having  by the Throwing down a piece of Silk  inform'd 'em she is there the Amorous Madmen strait begin to strip one Arm  above the Elbow  drawing with the other hand their  Sharpedg'd Dagger  and exerting  each  his Brightest Faculties in  Singing Riding Leap∣ing  Hurling the  Geritt  or  Javelin  and an Hundred other Exercises in which the Vanity of  either  has perswaded him to think he can excell the  other  A dreadfull way of mak∣ing Love  BUT the most ridiculous and senceless Method of expressing their Af∣fection is their singing certain  amorous  and  whining Songs  compos'd on purpose for such mad occasions between every line whereof they  cut  and  slash  their  naked Arms  with the abovenam'd Daggers each endeavouring in this emulative Madness to exceed the  other  by the depth and number of the Wounds he gives himself Some  Turks  I have observ'd when  old  and past the Follies which possess'd their  Youth  to show their Arms all  gash  'd and  scar'd  from  Wrist  to  Elbow  and express a great  Concern  but greater  Wonder  at their past simplicity  How the La∣dy makes her Choice  THE  Marble Hearted Lady  proof a while against these barbarous De∣monstrations of their  Love  at  last  makes choice of him whose  Air  and  Face  she best approves and speaks her Mind by throwing down a  Ball  of twisted Silk while he on whom her Mind is bent is whining out her Praises this produces frequently so great a fury in the disappointed Soul of him who loses her that running furiously upon his happier  Rival  they proceed at  Daggers length  a second time to try their  Titles  to her partial Favours and before they can be parted oftentimes prevent the Bliss of  either  by an interchangeable bestowing on each others Bosoms such amazing Wounds as bleed away their  Love  and  Life together  THE oddness of the Stile invited me to render some of the abovenam'd Songs into  English  which are the most esteem'd and run as follows  An amorous  Turkish  Song  Cou'd I  dear Ray  of heav'nly Light  Who  now  behind a Cloud dost shine  Obtain the Blessing of thy Sight  And tast thy Influence all Divine  Thus wou'd I shed my warm  Heartsblood  As now I gash my  veiny  Arm  Wou'dst thou but  like the Sun  think good  To draw it  upwards  by some Charm  Another follows as diverting as the former  Another  Tur∣kish  Song on the same Subject  Oh  lovely Charmer  pity me  See how my  Bloood  does from me fly  Yet were I sure to conquer thee  Witness it  Heav'n  I'd gladly die  But  oh  I fear when I am  dead  In  t'other World  we shall not meet  If not how  like a Fool  I'm sped  For dying  blindly  at your Feet  I have  at large  inform'd my  Reader  of their Matrimonial Ceremonies and have nothing  further  left to tell him on that Subject but that however loose the Inclinations of the  Turkish Ladies  may be rendred by Confinement it is seldom known that any Wife defiles her Husband's Bed perhaps 'tis  owing to their want of opportunity for I must own my self a  great  and  ut∣ter Enemy  to that restriction which the  Eastern Nations  lay upon their Wo∣men and believe that where a  mutual Freedom Liberty  and  Familiarity  is  by Custom  or  Ʋnkindness  any ways deny'd a Married Couple 'tis impossible to reach that elevated Happiness describ'd by  Horace  in his thirteenth Ode  Hor  Ode Lib  Felices ter amplius  Quos irrupta tenet copula nec malis  Divulsus querimoniis  Suprema citius solvet amor die  Happy  thrice happy  more than  blest  Are the  unshaken Pair  Whose  Tie  stands fix'd in  eithers  Breast  Unbroke by  Grief  or  Care    Whose  grounded Love  by trifling  Jars  Feels no  abrupt  Decay  But keeps within true Duties  Barrs  Firm to the  latest Day  CHAP XIV Of the  Turkish  Women in General  IF by the Title of the Chapter the Reader may be induc'd to expect a particular Account of the  exterior  Qualifications of the  Turkish La∣dies  he must imagine a difference in their  Persons  and  Complexions  answerable to the Climate of a  hotter  or  colder  Country whose  various Influences  must unquestionably produce as  various Effects  in the Persons of its Natives  The  Turkish  Wives submis∣sive and re∣spectfull to their Hus∣bands  But as the unlimited Authority which the  Turks  usurp as a right of Nature over their submissive Wives extends its force to the re∣motest Borders of their  unmeasur'd Empire  The continued Practice of a  Con∣jugal Obedience  has bent the nature of their haughtiest Women to acknow∣ledge readily an  inferiority of Sex  and obey their Husbands with the strictest Duties of an unfeign'd Humility This usefull Maxim which is for ever taught 'em with the earliest Rudiments of their infant Knowledge has  among many other  this one Effect that by representing the  Women  even in their own Imaginations  subservient  to the Will of  Man  it inspires them all with an ardent Zeal in the daily Practice of those  alluring  Parts of Edu∣cation which may render their Persons most charming and agreable to the happy Object of their exalted Wishes  The great Ad∣vantages thereof  MANY  besides this  are the great Advantages the  Turks  receive from their Wives  Subjection  for it entirely frees 'em from the  imperious  Behavi∣our of  insulting YokeMates  keeps 'em secure from the uneasy Discords of a  jealous Consort  and gives their leisure Hours an entire Possession of the fullest Pleasures to be found in  Matrimony  while the common Plagues and  bitter Minutes of some  Europaean Marriages  are altogether strangers to the sweet Enjoyment of their  Consummate Happiness  How Wives are kept in  Turkey  'TIS a sense of awfull  Fear  and  Duty  that obliges them contentedly to live  at Home  without the smallest Power in Domestick matters shut up  together  in a long Appartment divided  like our Hospitals  for several Beds where free from  Envy Pride  or  Jealousy  they  Eat Drink  and  Work together  Guarded by the Watchful Observation of  Industrious Eunuchs  and excluded from the Society of  Men  above Ten Years Old never Stirring from their Houses nor making Visits to their Neighbours but all entirely bent to please  by turns  the Wandring will of their Respected Husband  THESE then are the  Chief Accomplishments  of their Womens Minds which are Moulded by the  same Customs  to the  same Nature  in every Part of their Country And tho' some Provinces have been esteem'd more Fa∣mous than others for the Beauty of their Women the Following Account will serve as a Description of the  Turkish Ladies  The Excel∣lence of their Complexions  THEIR  Complexions  are for the most Part of a  Lovely Fair  and with∣out the help of  Art  so exquisitely  Smooth  and  Ruddy  that 'tis beyond the Power of  Imagination  to Guess at their  Beauty  which Extraordinary Per∣fection they owe to their so frequent use of  Bathing  and Perpetual Confine∣ment to their Houses by which means they are never Ruffled by the  Changes  of the  Weather  nor subject to the Sultry Influences of a  Scorching Sun  but 'tis observable that they lose their Beauty much sooner than the Inhabitants of the  Northern World  for the daily use of  Bagnio  's tho' it smooths their Skin and softens their Complexions does  notwithstanding  prejudice their Constitu∣tions by the Warm effects of its  Sulphureous Quality  A Discription of the Persons of the  Turkish  Ladies  Their  Features  are Gene∣rally most agreeably  Regular  of an exact and sweet Proportion their  Eyes  of a Piercing  Black  almost Transparently  Bright  and  Striking  and the larger they are the more Esteem'd for so vast a Value do the  Turks  Profess for  Great Ey'd Ladies  that the Enjoyment of such is by  Mahomet  promis'd them as one of the Sublimest Joys of their  Chimerical Paradise  Arch'd EyeBrows Judg'd a Beauty by the  Turks  the  Arched Excel∣lency  of their  Eyebrows  is no small Addition to the Beauty of their Features and so Nicely sensible they are of this Perfection that where  Nature  has de∣ny'd 'em so agreeable a Charm they are never contented till by the  repeat∣ed  Applications of  Artificial Endeavours  they raise their Brows to a lofty  Semicircle  meeting over their Nose in a  Sharp  and  Gracefull Angle  Their Shapes and Aires  I can hardly speak of their  Shapes  with so large  Encomiums  as I have done of their  Beauty  since the Looseness of their  Dress  denies them that  forc'd Slenderness of Wast  so much admir'd by our  Europaean Ladies  but tho' they boast not  that one Excellency  Nature has adorn'd 'em with a  Thousand others  which sufficiently supply its want for their Bodies have somewhat of  an agreeable turn  and their Motions carry a  Peculiar Grace  in an  Easy  and  un∣affected  Freedom of behaviour the Native Chams of an  Amorous Softness  appear unfeignedly in  every look  while  every Step  bears somewhat of an Air not altogether free from a  Majestic Gravity  and yet entirely Govern'd by an  Ʋncommon Easiness  The  Turkish  Ladies are Lasciviously inclin'd  I am sorry after so  true  yet  great  a Character of their  Persons  to De∣scend to the Weakness of their  unguarded Vertue  which lies so open and  Ʋn∣fortifyed by Principle  as to be Incapable of resisting the smallest Temptation of a Favourable Opportunity This Vice of  Incontinency  is undoubtedly no  Hereditary  Misfortune deriv'd from their  Ancestors  since most of the  Modern Turks  especially those of  Europe  are Descended from the  Greeks  the old Inhabitants of that Subverted Country a Nation so entirely free from  Lewdness  and  Immorality  that they Instructed all the World in the  Sublimest  Vertues  The reasons of their Lewd¦ness  The warm Desires which at present sway the looser Inclinations of the  Turkish Ladies  are rather the effects of their unnatural Confinement and the strict  Prohibition  they are under from the Society of  Mankind  which raising their Imaginations to an opinion of a more elevated Bliss than is really found in the Conversation of  our Sex  enflames their  Wishes  as it heightens their  Curiosity  and renders the coldest Constitution of 'em all an easy Conquest to the first Addresses of an advent'rous Lover and 'tis no wonder they have no more regard to their  Vertue  or their  Honour  while the Duties of  Religion  are never taught 'em but  on the contrary  their Mind's possess'd that as  God  has given them a Soul  inferiour to that of Man  he exacts less Service from the  Female Sex  whom he only created for the  Ʋse  and  Satisfaction  of the  nobler Males  BY these Notions and the want of Liberty  beforemention'd  they are all led to so vast an esteem of  Men  that they scarce know a difference in their  Merits  receiving  promiscuously  all such as  Chance  or  Assurance  throws in their way and proceeding without the Ceremonies of a  formal Courtship  to a plenary Satisfaction of their lewd Desires  The Lewd∣ness of the  Turkish  Ladies when they can convey some Stranger into their Appart∣ments  and so  lascivious  are their Inclinations that if  by the ingenuity of their Contrivances  they can procure the Company of  some Stranger  in their Chamber they claim  unanimously  an equal share of his  Caresses  and proceed  by Lots  to the Enjoyment of his Per∣son nor can he be permitted to leave them till having exerted his  utmost Vigour  in the Embraces of the  whole Company  he becomes incapable of fur∣ther Service and is dispatch'd with the  Thanks  and  Presents  of the oblig'd Family  I will desire my Reader's Patience while I entertain him with a fair Ex∣ample of the  Levity  for which I thus accuse the  Turkish Ladies  'tis not now above eight Years since first it hap'ned to a fond  Mahometan  who all pos∣sess'd with  Europaean  Dreams of  Love  and  Beauty  wou'd neither  marry  Wife nor take a  Concubine  that was not Mistress of a tender Nature and as he thought accomplish'd sweetly in those bright Perfections which in spite of Fate must make him happy  The folly of our inconside∣rate love of Beauty  but oh how vainly does deluded Man de∣pend on  Beauty  as a means of Bliss when every frail Misfortune of defici∣ent Nature robs him of his Hope it is a Blessing ever subject to a thou∣sand  accidental  shocks of Ruin and even in its longest and  uninterrupted  course of Sunshine but the transient Shadow of a  momentary  Satisfaction excellently defin'd by  Seneca  in his Tragedy of  Hippolytus  Anceps forma bonum mortalibus  Exigui donum breve temporis  Ʋt velox celeri pede laberis  Oh Beauty  doubtfull Good  to human kind  Thou  shortliv'd  Blessing  transient  as the Wind  How dost thou  slide  with  slipp'ry speed  away  And how the baffled hopes of Mortal Life betray  THE  Turk  of whom I am about to speak was long an Enemy to ev'ry Thought that led him to a  Scene of Matrimony  but he was caught at last and I have ever found that those who most inveigh'd against it have been soonest tempted to its  Yoke  and often most gaul'd by it It was a very witty Observation made by an old  Greek Poet  in the follow∣ing  Epigram  The witty Observation of an ancient  Greek  The Man is curs'd who takes a  She  As  Partner  of his Bed  This  all Men  know as well as  me  Yet who forbears to  Wed  A pleasant Story of the bold Adven∣ture of an  En∣glish  Sailor  THIS  Turkish Nobleman  for smiling Fortune had enlarg'd his Circum∣stances to a great and lofty pitch of Splendour kept a very large  Haramm  or  Chamber of his Women  he possess'd  I think  of  Wives  and  Concubines  no less a Number than  a quarter of an Hundred  and so fondly doated on their amo∣rous Conversation that he knew no Pleasure greater than the Enjoyment of their Company wou'd pass whole Days in their  Apartment  and chuse some one among them  every Night  to carry to his  Bed  and favour with the Duty of his kind Embraces  HOWEVER whether  Nature  had not qualified him for the  Womens Favourite  or whether  every Lady  thought her turn too long in coming is not known but this is certain that the whole Society of Beauties were ex∣treamly Melancholy and wou'd pensively retire to a large Window which look'd out upon a  Garden  on the backside of their Apartment and by throwing up the  Lettice  let in  Air  which  fan'd  not  cool'd  the warmth of their Desires their  Lord  it seems was very covetous and finding  Eunuch's  somewhat chargeable maintain'd but one and that an  old  and  lazy  Fellow who wou'd always go to Bed before his  Ladies  and by that means give them favourable Opportunities to open the abovenam'd Win∣dow and look out upon the  Garden  or divert themselves with any Enter∣tainment they thought fit to pass the Night in  'TWAS late  one Evening  and the Family secure in their repose when a brisk  English Sailor  who had lost his Company in coming  not an Hour before  from drinking at a little  Hovel  where a  Greek  sold Wine had rambled up and down from Street to Street till he arriv'd in a small narrow Lane one Wall whereof belong'd to the abovenam'd Garden  A lucky Curiosity  he was walking hastily along not knowing whereabouts he was when he was startled at the sudden noise of Womens Voices and desirous to behold what sort of Creatures  Females  were in  Turkey  he was led by  Wine  and  Curiosity together  to ascend a sort of Wooden Scaffold which he found there rais'd against the Wall and had been built in order to repair some Breaches made by Time  THE Art of his Profession had instructed him to climb by which means he with ease got up so high that hanging by his Hands and Feet he overlook'd the ridge of the Wall and cou'd perceive distinctly by the favour of the  Moonshine  several Ladies almost in their Shifts and sporting wantonly together in a Window on the other side the Garden he was wonderfully pleas'd to see a sight he had been long a Stranger to and not being able to express himself in  Turkish  was resolv'd to show his Breeding in the  English Language  and call'd out aloud  A comical Salutation  Ha my dear Rogues have I caught ye faith Egad I wish I was among ye  NOTHING cou'd have been a greater surprize to the discover'd  Ladies  than to hear a  Voice  at once appearing to be  a Man  's and  Stranger  to their  Language  or  Acquaintance  but 'twas encreas'd  if possible  when they beheld a  Head Chin high  looking o'er the Wall with  short thick Hair  and  Hat  of  English  Fashion  A Surprize soon over  the fright at first oblig'd 'em to a  Shriek  and drove 'em from the Window for about five Minutes but perceiving none had overheard them in the House they gather'd Courage and return'd again believing  Providence  had sent a  Man  to gratifie their Wishes  THE  Sailor  had by this time got astride upon the Wall and was be∣ginning an  old Ballad  in that merry Posture not remembring he had chang'd  his  Wapping Residence  for a short continuance in a  Turkish City  But the  Ladies  gather'd in a  knot  about the  Window  and by the  cautionary Motions  of their Fingers hush'd him into silence and began to beckon him with smi∣ling Looks and all the tempting Invitations of an  amorous Deportment  A very kind familiar Invi∣tation  ENCOURAG'D by their unexpected  kind Behaviour  the adven∣t'rous  Tarr  forsook his Station and leaping from the  Wall  into the  Garden  express'd his Satisfaction in their beautifull Appearances by all the  aukward  Bows and  apish Cringes  his Marine Accomplishments had made him Ma∣ster of He came at last and stood directly under them explaining by the Motions of his  Head  and  Eyes  and other Signs that he was sorry such an inaccessible Heighth prevented him from reaching them  An obliging Condescenti∣on  THEY talk'd a while by  Signs  and  Motions  but perceiving they cou'd reap but little Pleasure from so remote a Conversation the obliging  Ladies  loth to lose so rare an Opportunity began to make  successfull  use of those  inventive  Faculties which  Nature  constantly bestows on Woman in her amorous Exigencies and while certain of the Company continued at the Window smiling in a sort of wanton Dalliance with the  raptur'd Sailor  others ran and tied as many of their Sheets together as wou'd reach the Ground which having done they came again and making fast the  hither end  to certain  Hooks within the Chamber  threw the other down to him and kindly beck'ned him to make a proper use of their inviting Fa∣vours  A bold Ad∣venture  HE was not  backward  in performing their desires but  never thinking of the Consequences which might happen  made a shift to reach the Window by the help of their Contrivance they receiv'd him joyfully and had begun to stare upon the strangeness of his Habit when he interrupted them by roughly kissing all the Company imagining that since he always us'd his  English Mistresses  in that familiar manner it was the Fashion so to do in every  Foreign Place  he came to  THE  Turkish Husbands  never kiss their  Women  but in  Bed  and conse∣quently this Behaviour of our merry  Britain  wonderfully diverted them they laugh'd exceedingly and gather'd round him every one ask'd some particular Question but he cou'd not understand one Word they said and finding more than he expected in the Chamber look'd about him with a  great amazement  but began at last to catch them in his Arms embracing them by turns with so much  zeal  and  rapture  that 'twas hard to tell which Party knew most pleasure  he  in meeting such  engaging beautifull  and  willing Creatures  or the  Ladies  in their accidental Satisfaction of admit∣ting to their Arms a  Lover  of so brisk and airy a  Deportment  and a Man so full of  Mirth  and  Ʋigour  A very fair Proceeding of the  Turkish  Ladies  THE Room wherein they lay was  long  and  broad  with  Beds  all laid in order along either side and each desirous  first  to offer him a part of hers they rais'd a sort of  War among  them till it was resolv'd that all shou'd draw a Lot a piece and stand to the decision  THIS then  at last  they all agreed to and with  Scissars  cut a Crimson  Ribband  into  five and twenty Pieces  each a little longer than the former these they made the  Sailor  hold and drew their  Lots  in order she who had the  longest  was that  very Night  to have him for her  Bedfellow  and so  proportionably  she who had unfortunately drawn the  shortest Lot  was doom'd to be the  farthest distant  from his  wish'd Embraces  The Order they contriv'd to keep  THUS had they form'd almost an  whole Months Task  for the  poor Sailor  who never us'd to think on time to come and therefore went con∣tentedly to Bed with his fair  firstnight Mistress  We will not doubt the satisfaction which he met with but proceed to tell the  Reader  that  an hour before the break of Day  that  Lady  who was  next  to be his  Partner  came and wak'd him from a pleasing Slumber lest he shou'd unluckily by  oversleeping his Security  be found  as soon as Morning broke  by the  Eunuch  who was al∣ways us'd to walk his Rounds about that time and this was the concluded order they were all to take for their assur'd Security  I scarce believe our  amorous Tarpawlin  when the cool reflection of his waking Senses represented his condition found himself so pleasant as the Night before but he had gone too far to think of going back till he had done the Duty they expected from him and therefore  wisely  thought it best to seem transported with his  present past  and  future Happiness  The Contri∣vance which they made to hide him  In short they led him to a very high and spacious  Pr  ss  or rather  Wardrobe  for it was the Place wherein they us'd to hang their Cloaths in this  Repository  he was forc'd to  stand  or  lie  all Day and had the Door  by chance  been op'ned he had yet  perhaps  continued undiscover'd  hid  all over by the Cloaths about him  THE Master of the House wou'd often come and pass some Hours every Day amongst his Women so that all Day long the  Sailor  was con∣fin'd to keep his Station yet wanted little else but Liberty for he had  Meat  and  Drink  far more than he requir'd  Their good na∣tur'd manner of getting him Provisions  which the  good humour'd La∣dies  order'd to be set aside pretending they wou'd eat it at another time and taking some convenient Opportunity when all was safe they carry'd it directly to their  pounded Amoroso  All over∣turn'd by an unlucky Ac∣cident  THEY pass'd about ten  Days  and  Nights  without the smallest  fear  or danger of  Discovery  when an unlucky Accident fell out and ruin'd all it hap'ned that the  Lady  to whose turn 'twas come  that Night  to claim the  Sailor  for her  Bedfellow  was taken by the  Turk  her  Lord  and  Master  to the  unexpected  Favour of his own Enjoyment so that she whose  Lot  came  next  was  sooner than she thought of Mistress  of her  long hop'd Happiness  but when the next turn came the Lady who the Night before had lawfully possess'd her Husband's Bed renew'd her Title to the  baulk'd  Enjoyment of the  Sailor's Person  which  she  who next expected it deny'd with fervour urging that she having lost her turn shou'd stay till  last  of all before she cou'd  in justice  lay a  second Claim  to what she aim'd at  The Sailor's dangerous Discovery  WORDS were multiplied to noisy Disputations and  from thence  they fell to downright Blows about the matter till the House  alarm'd by their Disturbance  wak'd the  Eunuch  who came running to the  Chamber  to de∣mand the Cause of their so sudden Disagreement and the first thing he took particular notice of was the  poor Sailor  who was got among the thickest of the  Fray  to interpose the best of his Endeavours for appeasing their tumultuous Violence  His bold At∣tempt to get away  THE  Eunuch  all amaz'd to see a  Man  so strangely dress'd  among the La∣dies  came and caught him  roughly  by the  Shoulder  who surpriz'd as much to find himself discover'd struck the  old  and  feeble Eunuch  such a Blow up∣on the Head as beat him to the Ground and running to the Window ne∣ver staid to look for  Sheots  which  if he had he wou'd have miss'd  but ven∣turing his  Neck  to save his Liberty leap'd nimbly down and lighting on the soft and yielding Mould receiv'd no hurt but made a shift to  clamber  up a  Gate  which open'd to the Lane and after half an hours rambling up and down  half dead with fear  came out upon the  Port  where lay an  English Vessel half Ʋnladen  close upon the  Key  He got  Onboard  and over∣joy'd at his escape went  next Morning  to the Vessel he belong'd to which departed two days after  bound for Alexandria  The Liberali∣ty of the  Turk∣ish  Ladies  HE brought off Ten or Twelve considerable  Diamonds  of a greater Value than the Profits of a Hundred of his Voyages cou'd possibly a∣mount to every  Lady  gratefully bestowing  One  the Night she Bedded him Had he but staid to have gone through the Family he had grown Rich by their  Successive Bounties  but he had cause to be contented with his Fortune  eitherway  And what will serve to make this Accident the more diverting is that when the  Eunuch  rose and look'd about him the Ingenious  Ladies  joyn'd to tell him an Amazing Story how the Man he saw came in and Frighted them which Passing for a truth they sav'd their  Reputations  and perhaps their  Lives  while it was commonly re∣ported  round the City  that the  Devil  or an  Infidel  had entred the  Ha∣ramm  of such a  Nobleman  nor was it known which way he had  got in  or how he cou'd find means to get away again  A Story of the Unfortunate Intrigue of a  French  Embas∣sadors Secre∣tary  LESS  Fortunate  tho' equally  Adventurous  was the Comical  Amour  of a Young Gentleman  Secretary  to the  French Embassadour  at  Constantinople  a∣bout the Year who Attempting to have Brib'd an  Eunuch  of a  Turkish Noblemans Haramm  receiv'd Encouragement to hope Admission on a certain Night when coming by Direction of the abovenam'd  Eunuch  to a certain  Woodpile  in the  Yard  belonging to the House where∣in they were he Mounted on the  Loggs  and waited for a Summons  HE had not long continued there before a certain  Lady  purposely  as 'twas reported afterwards  admitted to a Chamber very near him came and look'd about her at the Window the  Amorous Monsieur  had no sooner fix'd his Eyes upon her  A silent way of making Love  but believing  that  to be the Future Object of his  Love  he put in practice all the  Lears Bows Cringes  and  Grimaces  he was capable of using  BUT while thus employ'd upon the  Turkish Woodpile  the Master of the House who had been told the  Secret  by his faithful  Eunuch  came Attended by a Number of his Servants and Apprehended him amidst the Numerous Airs of his too distant Courtship  The bad suc∣cess of his A∣mour  No excuse cou'd plead his Pardon but he was immediately led out and in  the very Gate  set open purposely to gather Lookers on receiv'd  two Hundred Bastinadoes  on the Soles of his Feet and was turn'd out to hop along the Streets and reach his Home as well as his sore Bruises wou'd permit him  The  Turks  sharp answer to the  French  Embassadors complaint  COMPLAINTS were made by the  Embassador  his Master but the  Turkish Court  return'd for answer that  as all their dealings with the se∣veral Ministers of Foreign Princes had been hitherto directed by the Cu∣stoms of their Country so they knew not well to grant a Satisfaction for an Ac∣cident which had not yet afforded them a Precedent  Thereby Insinuating that the  Secretary  had so  greatly  and so  openly Affronted  the  Turk  who  Bastinado'd  him that 'twas an  Action  whose  peculiar  Insolence was  past Example  Loves blind effects excuse∣able in all Men  LET  Love  excuse the  Amorous Frenchmans  rash attempt or rather his Miscarriage 'tis a  Flame  will Burn in every Country and the  Smoak  it raises may excuse the Blindness of the  objects  which it Seizes on No Man can always run too fast for following  Indiscretion  and you know who tells us  Nemo omnibus horis Sapit No Man is always free from Folly  Well spoke that  Ancient Greek  who asks this Question in the very Case we now are Treating on  Ah  brainless  Youth in vain you fly from  Love  He's  wing'd  and you  on foot  who then must  swiftest  move  The  Turkish  Ladie's want of Honour ra∣ther to be pitied than condemn'd  CONSIDER  Readers  when you see this strange Account of  the Fair Sex in Turkey  'tis not  Nature  but the Rules of  Education  which inspire the most  accomplish'd Chastity  with purer Notions and if the  rude  and  barbarous Ignorance  wherein the  Turkish Women  are oblig'd to live has sacrific'd their  Honour  to the  warmth  of their  Desires  rather  pity  than  condemn  their want of Vertue and remember in compassion of their Frailties that  Humanum est errare  'Tis natural for all Mankind to go astray  CHAP XV Of the  Turkish  Customs and Ceremonies in Conversation  IN describing the general Customs of the  Turkish Conversation  'twill be the plainest Method to begin with their  Morning Exercises  and trace them through the various Entertainments of a  busy Day  for when you know what manner of Living is practis'd by the  richest  and  most active  of their People you may easily guess at the less  stately  or  stirring  Life of the remainder  The first Em∣ployment whereto Great Men in  Turkey  put the Day  EACH then obeys  for the most part  the Summons of the  earliest Cock  and rising from his  Mattress  for  FeatherBeds  are never us'd in  Turkey  his  Slaves  attend in an obsequious Reverence to wait his Motions to the  Bag∣nio  which  Great Men  constantly build in their Houses  others  must be contented with the Publick ones  Here  when throughly cleans'd they rub him with Napkins till he is dry and then attend him silently to that part of his House he pleases to be dress'd in every Servant knows his Office one puts on his  Shirt  another his  Wastcoat  the third his  Vest  and another his  Turbant  till he is at last compleatly ready  Their Diver∣sions when at Home  IF he intends a  Visit  he commands his Attendants to put themselves in order and in the mean time sits  cross leg'd  on a  Cushion  in the corner of some  Saffrai looking into his Gardens smoaking Tobacco drinking Coffee  or perhaps  playing at Chess  with some  Favorite Eunuch  which are the only  Do∣mestick Diversions  in use amongst them  Their manner of making Visits  WHEN his  Horse  is ready for they seldom visit  on foot  he comes gravely down to the Gate of his House thro' a double Row of his Atten∣dants  who laying their Hands on their Bosoms bow slowly to the Ground and kiss the corners of his  Vest  which is the common Salutation of the  Turks  to their  Superiors  his Horse is cover'd with a stately  Caparison  of  Cloath of Gold  or  Silver  sometimes adorn'd with  Jewels  which reaches from under the Saddle to his Heels his Stirrops are of  Silver  and so large as to contain his whole Foot they are held  while he mounts  by  two  of his Servants and when he moves he is follow'd by a great number of them on Foot walking  two by two  at equal distance  How they re∣ceive each o∣ther at their Houses  in this order he proceeds to the House of him he would visit having before given him notice where alighting at the bottom of the Stairs he is conducted  thro' double rows of Servants  to the Presence of their  Master  who meets him  nearer to  or  farther from  his Room of State according to the difference of their Quality tho' to  Christians  they never stirr out of their Places but receive them sitting after the  mutual Compliments  of somewhat declining their Bodies with their Hand on their Bosom they proceed thro' several Rooms to that they are to sit in the  Stranger  as they walk always taking  the left Hand  preferr'd as the noblest Place in Conversation because whoever has it is suppos'd to be Master of the others Seymetar as  I think  I have in the foregoing part inform'd my Reader When they are entred they advance to that elevated part of the Floor call'd the  Saffrai  and place themselves  crossleg'd  opposite to each other on Cushions richly cover'd with their Hands upon their Laps  like our Women  How they are Enter∣tain'd in Visits  NOW begins  Discourse  which is hardly enter'd on when several  Pages  richly dress'd bring in a Silk or Muslin Handkerchief finely embroi∣der'd and spread it on the  Strangers  Lap then comes another with a  Sal∣ver  containing several sorts of SweetMeats in little Spoons like those we use for  Tea  some of these he eats and is immediately attended by a third with a  Dish of Coffee  that drank the Handkerchief is taken away and they withdraw but the  Visiter  has hardly renew'd his Discourse when they return again with another Handkerchief which being spread  as before one  sprinkles SweetWater in his Face from a Silver Bottle and  another  smoak∣ing his  Beard  and the inside of his  Vest  with burnt Perfume from a golden IncensePan they withdraw again these two Ceremonies are usually per∣form'd at the  Page's Discretion  as to the time between them but there re∣mains a  third  which they must wait their  Master  's call for and that is the bringing in a large Dish of  Sherbet  of an excellent Flavour which as soon as the  Stranger  has drank he takes leave and goes away  A very odd Custom  for 'tis their Custom never to call for that Liquor till they grow weary of their  Visiter's Company  THEY seldom eat above one  Meal  a Day and  that  a  Dinner  they are rarely known to be  luxurious  in their Appetite and  are yet extreamly covetous  of heaping  vast  and  numerous Sums  of Money from the  Offices  they hold unskill'd in that incomparable Doctrine of  Horace  in the twelfth Epi∣stle of his first Book  Hor  Epist Lib  Tolle Querelas  Pauper enim non est cui rerum suppetit Ʋsus  Si ventri bene si lateri est pedibusque tuis nil  Divitiae poterunt regales addere majus  Cease your Complaints  'Tis not the  want of Riches  makes Men poor  Nor can your  Wealth  a lasting Bliss procure  If you have  Meat  and  Drink  and  Habit  too  Oh learn  Content  what  more  can  Riches  do  The  Turkish  Diet  THEIR  Diet  is but course and rarely varied consisting generally of  boil'd Hens  or  Mutton  and a sort of  butter'd Rice  of late much us'd in  Bri∣tain  where 'tis call'd according to the  Turkish Name Pilowe  their  Butter  is not made like ours but  on the contrary  is nothing else but  Sheeps Tail Fat  once melted down and so preserv'd in certain Skins for common Uses  Sheep with Tails so large that they are forc'd to draw them after 'em on Carriages  AND since I mention  Turkish Sheep  it will not be digressive from the Subject I'm upon to tell you that there are in many Provinces of  Persia  and the  Grand Signior  's Country  Sheep  whose Tails are so prodigiously encumbred with an incredible load of  Fat  that  twenty thirty  often  forty English Pounds  of Grease are taken from the Tail of  one sole Sheep  nay to such a  bulk  and  weight  they sometimes grow that 'tis a very common  Scene  in many Parts of  Turkey  to behold 'em dragging after them their  pond'rous Rumps  on  twowheel'd Carriages  contriv'd on purpose  Turkish  Pies  ANOTHER sort of Diet us'd among the  Turks  are certain  Pies  in∣differently bak'd and fill'd with Meats of various kinds but so excessively and  past all relish  mix'd with  Garlick  that the strongest  Appetite  of  France it self  cou'd scarce digest them  Their manner of dressing RoastMeat  THEY seldom roast and when they do observe a very different manner from the  Europaean  Practice all their  Fires  are made in  holes  cut  one  or  two  Foot deep in Earth about the several Parts of all their Kitchins an  Iron Engine  shap'd not much unlike a  Gibbet  holds a String which fast'ned to some part of any thing they roast turns gradually round and so prepares it for their easy Palates  A very savory sort of Dish in use among the  Turks  ONE Dish they have in frequent use  of relish not unsavory  which may be nam'd a sort of  forc'd Meat  it consists of many kinds of  Flesh  all minc'd and chop'd together with the  rind of Limons Nutmegs Pepper Cloves  and  Cinnamon  all this they roll when season'd into  Balls  of reasonable sizes wrapping them about with doubled  Bayleaves  newly gather'd and pro∣ceeding so to roast 'em with a gentle Fire This  I think  they call  Kabobb  and is  if my skill'd Country Cooks will take my Word  a sort of palatable Prepara∣tion worth the imitating  Their way of making Bread  AS for  Bread  they use no other than a sort of  flat  and  doughback'd  Cake they call  Ecmeck  they make it of a course and illground  Flour  rend'red moist by  Milk  and  Water  after it is kneaded they proceed to press it out with heavy  rolling Pins  and cutting Cakes in Trencher form lay many on an  heated Hearth  by one another throwing over them the  hot  and  burning Ashes  till they judge 'em bak'd sufficiently by which means they are very harsh and grating in the Teeth as if some  Sand  had fallen up∣on them  Their manner of Eating  WHEN they eat they use no  Plates Knives Forks  or any thing but  Wooden Spoons  not much unlike the fashion of our  Ladles  these Cakes of Bread supply the place of Plates or Trenchers upon them they lay their Meat so throughly  boil'd  or  roasted  that they tear with ease what part they chuse by the assistance of their Fingers eating last of all the Plates themselves as did  Aeneas  and his newly landed  Trojans  thus describ'd by  Virgil  in his seventh  Aeneid  Virg  Aen  Consumptis heic forte aliis ut vertere morsus  Exiguam in  Cererem  penuria adegit edendi  Et violare manu malisque audacibus orbem  Fatalis crusti patulis nec parcere quadris  Heus etiam mensas consumimus inquit Julus  AN EXPLANATION OF THE PLATE Which Represents the Manner of DINING Among the  TURKS  of  QUALITY  THE Place they Sit in is a  Kiosk  or  SummerHouse  The Posture of the Servants the Towel that goes Round on all their Laps the Man who Reaches Water from the Fountain the Car∣pet on the Floor and every Figure in the Piece is done as Natu∣rally as is Possible  depiction of Turks of quality at dinner  Turks of Quality at dinner  To her Grace Mary Dutchess of Ormond c This Plate is most humbly Dedicated  S Bois  While having swiftly swallow'd all their Meat  Nor finding further  Dainties  left to eat  Insatiate  Hunger  not yet fully fed  Forc'd their keen Teeth to gnaw their  smallshar'd  Bread  With eager  Jaws  and  Hands  to  bite  and  tear  The poor Remains of their  portentous  Fare  Nor ev'n the  very Plates themselves  to spare  See cry'd  Ascanius  we no Morsel lose  But make those  Trenchers  Meat which we  for Meat  shou'd use  Their Po∣stures when they eat  THEY sit at Meals  crosslegd  about a  Table  scarce so much as half Foot high made hollow and the inside plated o'er with  Tin  or  Silver  in their Laps there lies a long course  Towel  very narrow reaching round the whole Table whose uncover'd Surface contains their several Dishes still remov'd as soon as tasted to make room for others only diff'ring in the Colour of the  Soop  wherein their Meat is brought before 'em  The Drink they use at Meals  AS for Drink they rarely use at Dinner any other than the Fountain Water commonly at hand in all their  Dining Rooms  and taken up in  Sil∣ver Gold  or  Earthen Cups  that moment it is call'd for by the  Servants  who attend them It is seldom known that all the Family sit down together to their Meat one  Smoaks  another  Sings  a third perhaps is playing on his  Fiddle  one is  Eating  and a fifth employ'd at  Chess  with some Companion of no greater Stomach than him self but that their ways of  Eating  and their  Postures  when about it may be understood more fully I have here annex'd a  Cut  wherein the Reader may behold 'em plainly repre∣sented  THEY commonly delight in sprightly Exercises after Dinner as be∣lieving 'em  conducive  to their  Healths  and  Reputation  many Sports they use all which I shall describe in proper order and will  first  proceed to treat about their Hurling the  Geritt  the  favourite Exercise  of all these Peo∣ple  Hurling the Dart a com∣mon Exercise in  Turkey  THIS Manly Sport is not unlike  perhaps the same  with that  ancient Roman  Custom of  darting Javelins  from their Hands the  Vigour  wherewith they threw them and the  Execution  they perform'd when thrown may be conceiv'd by the Description of the Death of  Turnus  in  Virgil  's last  Aeneid  Virg  Aen  ult  Cunctanti telum  Aeneas  fatale coruscat  Sortitus fortunam oculis corpore toto  Eminus intorquet Murali concita nun quam  Tormento sic saxa fremunt nec fulmine tanti  Dissultant crepitus Volat atri turbinis instar  Exitium dirum hasta ferens orasque recludit  Loricae Clypei extremos Septemplicis orbeis  Per medium stridens transit femur incidit ictus  Ingens ad terram duplicato poplite  Turnus  Aeneas  swift to use the  lucky Hour  Grasp'd his  strong Spear  with a  collected  Pow'r  And  lifting  all his Body to the throw  Aim'd at his  Rival's Breast  a dreadful Blow  Not from Stone Walls by  batt'ring Engines  broke  With half such  horrid Roar  resounds the Stroke  Not meeting  ThunderClaps  which rend the Sky  With such  loud Shocks  roll on and  striking  backwards fly  The  Jav'lin  flew like a  black Whirlwind  strong  Bearing  grim Death  with  hissing  force along  Till thro' the edge of his broad sev'nfold Shield  It pierc'd his  Coat of Mail  unus'd to yield  Transfix'd his Thigh with a surprizing Wound  And nail'd  with folded Knee  great  Turnus  to the Ground  The  Turks  how skill'd therein  NOR is the  Turkish  Skill inferior to the  Roman  in this celebrated Exer∣cise which is so common and  thereby  so exquisitely known that some are found among them  who with one strong throw  at fifty five Yards distance will with  blunt unheaded Wooden Javelins  break a Door of near  Inch thick∣ness  into twenty Pieces  NAY to such Perfection are the  Turks  arriv'd in this encourag'd Pra∣ctice that they never miss the smallest Mark they aim at using the Diver∣sion both on  Horseback  and on  Foot  and catching with their Hands the Wea∣pons of their Enemies in certain  Skirmishes  by way of  Single Combat  or a Party of an  Hundred Twenty Ten  or  more  or  less  against an equal Num∣ber  The Beauty of their grace∣full Forms of Exercising it  'Tis a curious sight and worthy observation to behold their admira∣ble  Horsemanship  and dext'rous Management of these  Gerits  at certain publick and appointed Trials by the way of  Challenge  where an  emulative fire  inspiring either side with hopes of Conquest leads 'em on to act as cautiously as if in earnest 'Tis amazingly agreable to see these Men a∣midst an hissing multitude of Darts which fly continually from side to side behave themselves with  free  and  unaffected  Carelessness with ease defend∣ing every Part and  turning prancing rearing  and  curvetting  on their Warlike Horses as if they were not two  distinct  and separated Bodies  Their dexte∣rity in several admirable Points  THEY bear within the left side of their Horses Girt a  certain Cane  of crooked top not much unlike a  Crook  or  Nuthook  with which they suddenly snatch up whatever  Javelin  lies upon the Ground which  some  can do without such help by bending from their Saddles in the swiftest Gallop  others  there are found in  Turkey  who will throw a Dart with all their Strength a little rising as it flys and watching eagerly the Course it takes spurr violently on and catch it as it is inclin'd to fall  some Yards before  it comes upon the Ground and this they often will repeat for  twenty  some∣times  thirty  Casts together  AND now since I occasionally spoke of  Turkish Horsemanship  I will describe the manner of their riding which together with the gracefull  Shape  couragious  Nature  and the swiftness of their Horses renders them the  surest  and  politest Horsemen  of the  Ʋniverse  The  Turkish  Saddles and Caparisons  THEIR Saddles are of deep and solid Make of gentle rise behind and bearing at the  Bow  a sort of  high  and  round Steel Brass  or  Silver headed Pummel  very dangerous to Men unus'd to Riding They tie their upper Girt quite round the Saddle under which is fast'ned to three Buck∣les a  Caparison  which falling largely back hangs almost to the Ground and being made of  Silk  or  Cloath  of various Colours is embroider'd richly with a  Gold  or  Silver Wire  and oftentimes set thick with pre∣cious Stones of a surprizing  Lustre  and inestimable Value their  Bitts  are excellently made of polish'd Steel so  sharp  and yet so  easy  that when gently held they cannot hurt a  softmouth'd Horse  and yet upon occasion will controul a  Lyon  All the  Bridles  us'd by  Gentlemen  are made about the breadth of one of our  Inches  of a sort of fine and twisted Silk of  Green Blue Scarlet White  or any other Colour  Their way of riding  BOTH their  Bridles  and their  Breastplates  are adorn'd with massy Plates of  Brass  or  Silver  gilt genteely and their  Stirrops  of a very large  unweildy size  with four sharp Corners which supply the want of  Spurrs  upon their  Boots  for those they never wear in  Turkey  They are fast'ned strongly to the Saddle Frame but hang so short that they are forc'd to ride with  Knees quite bent  as when they sit  Its advantage over ours  but tho' this Posture may not seem so gracefull to the  Eye  as ours in  Christendom  'tis yet far more  secure  and  usefull  for by this means  Turkish Horsemen  rising in their  Stirrops  and elonging all their Bodies to each Stroke they give both reach as far a∣gain as  we  can do and strike with twice the strength of  Europaean Caval∣ry  and 'tis in imitation of this  Eastern  Custom that the  Hussars  of our Army ride so short and are esteem'd so usefull in  Pursuits  or  Par∣ties  Their use of Bows and Arrows  ANOTHER Exercise much us'd among the  Turks  is shooting for a  Prize  with  Bows  and  Arrows  at which they are  expert  and  dext'rous  as I have said before but practise this Diversion in a very dull and slothfull manner always near the Mark and shooting at a sort of plaister'd  Target  while they fit in rows upon the shady Grass and send their  Servants  for the  Arrows  as they use 'em  Their Bows how made  All their  Bows  are toughly made of hard'ned  Horns  of  Buffelo  's mix'd with  Steel  of admirable Workmanship and finely  Gilt  and Painted with an airy Mixture of bright  Sylvan Co∣lours  The  Turkish  way of Wrest∣ling  WRESTLERS are esteem'd and very common but unskillfull in the dext'rous Art of  tripping  fairly all their Method is to strip their Bodys naked to the Middle  oyl their Joints  and stooping forward very low run aukwardly about each other making  sudden strange  and  uncouth noises  to surprize or startle their  Antagonist  and snatching with their Hands his  Leg  or  Thigh  so throw him upon his Back without so much as ever making use of  their own Legs  about it  Ropedancers and Juglers  ROPEDANCERS and a sort of  Juglers  are encourag'd to perform their several Tricks to please  with mean Amusements  in the open Street such Persons as will stand and gather round their Exercises who contribute  something each  to pay their Labours when a Fellow brings about a certain wooden Dish to every one of the  Spectators  and desires their  Penny Twopence  or whatever  more  or  less  they please to give him  The Carriages in  Turkey  THE Carriages in use in  Turkey  are a sort of  long  and heavy Wag∣gons drawn by  Buffelo  's a kind of Beast not much unlike an  Ox  but  stron∣ger far  and  larger  by one half their Horns are long and spread to such considerable Breadth that I have seen the  Tips  or  utmost Points  almost two Yards asunder  Their unfami∣liar way of Living  I have told  before  their manner of Saluting one another as for  Visiting  they seldom use it and when Business leads 'em to each other's Houses they are always entertain'd in outward Rooms nor are their  Wives  permitted to appear nor grow acquainted with their  Neighbour  's  Con∣sorts  Their manner of Sleeping in their Cloaths  THEY sleep on  Quilts  extreamly hard  and very often in their Cloaths  by which continued Custom they are  some of them  so  lousy  that you cannot pass a Street without observing three or four employ'd  while sitting at their Door or in their Shops  in searching for and killing those encroaching Ver∣min Nor do they blush to be discover'd in so strange an Action common  Practice  having made a Fashion of this  lazy Pastime  They make Water like Women  WHEN they have occasion to make Water they withdraw from publick Observation and  like Women  couch themselves almost upon the Ground least by an accidental  drop or two  upon their Cloaths they shou'd become defil'd They spit with scorn to see a  Christian  stand against a Wall and sometimes strike him as they pass along to signifie their hatred of his Action and Immodesty  A Story how a Gentleman was circum∣cis'd for pis∣sing against a  Turkish Mosque  I very well remember that I landed once at  Candy  with about four more all  Englishmen  and Strangers to the Customs of the Country we were busy in observing  as we walk'd along  the Buildings of the City and afforded as  surprizing Objects  as we look'd upon by being dress'd in  English Habits  till  at last  an inconsiderate and unluckly Member of our Company who found himself inclin'd to  Ʋrinate  turn'd round with far more  Confi∣dence  than  Wit  to do it just against the Corner of a  Turkish Mosque  THE People with a sudden hollow flew about us and began to use us somewhat roughly but a mild Deportment and submissive Carriage sav'd all harmless but the  frighted Criminal  he  poor Man  was doom'd to suf∣fer certain insolent and  unrestrain'd Levants  the Sailors of the Country came about him with their  Knives  all drawn and having a long time beaten him about the Head oblig'd him to lie down upon his Back and  never waiting for the usual Ceremonies  Circumcis'd the  strugling  and complaining  Gentleman  with Butcherlike Incision  THEY said abundance but to little purpose for we understood not then  one Syllable of Turkish  yet suppos'd they were upbraiding the Offender and advising him to err no more lest he shou'd meet a  second sort of Circum∣cision  far more  fatal  than the former and indeed the suffering Person was beyond expression overjoy'd to find his Loss not half so great as he at first expected it  Complaints are vain where Remedies are never found  so we were glad to march contentedly away resolving for the future to avoid the dan∣ger which our  Friend  had met with  A comical Humour of the Gentle∣man in rela∣tion to his Mistress  SHAME and regret so much confounded him that he endeavour'd  once  or  twice  to drown himself upon receiving a  kind amorous  Letter from a  Mistress  he had left in  England  and wou'd often swear he never wou'd re∣turn because of his Misfortune but it  seems  some merry  Gentleman  of his Acquaintance writ a Letter to the  Lady  and inform'd her of his  Resolution  and the  Accident  which caus'd it and upon her writing to her  Lover  that she knew the Business and was glad it was no worse the poor dispirited  Gallant  took Courage once again and ventur'd to go back He  Married her  immediately on his return and since he found  her  satisfy'd has little reason to continue melancholy I cou'd tell the Reader a more pleasant Story of a∣nother Gentleman but he's unmarried and might chance to lose his Mi∣stress by the Bargain  What the  Turks  hunt with Dogs  HUNTING is an Exercise in which the  Turks  take great delight sometimes  with Dogs  and sometimes  without  With  Dogs  but far inferior to our  English Breed  they course the  Stagg Fox Hare  and other swift defense∣less Animals but when they hunt the  Lyon Leopard Tyger Boar  or other Forest Beasts they use the Dogs for nothing but to rouse the  Game  and leave it to their Management  How they hunt Wild Beasts in  Turkey  THEY have both  Weekly Monthly  and  Yearly Hunting Matches  when the Gentlemen about the Country gather in a great and formidable Body at some noted Place of  Rendezvous  each mounted bravely on some  Horse  that has been train'd to Warlike Discipline and arm'd with a large  oval Target  full of Spikes almost yard long which hangs on their left Sides  upon their Shoulders certain  Quivers  full of the beforenam'd  Geritts  or  Steel pointed Javelins  and in their Girdles stick a  pair or two  of small  skrewbarrel'd  Pistols besides all these a crooked  Backsword  arms their  Thigh  When thus accout'red they obey the Summons of the  Captain  's  Trumpets  one distinguish'd by that Title being always over them  The Form they ride in  THE common form wherein they ride is that of an extended  Crescent  or  HalfMoon  whereby encompassing the corner of a Wood they send in Dogs to rouse the Beasts about it which the  cautious Currs  no sooner have perform'd but they come barking back and save themselves from dan∣ger by retiring underneath the Horses Heels If 'tis a  Lyon  or a  Tyger  they disturb those often have the Courage to run  roaring  forward and attack the Party  WHEN the Beast is seen approaching every Man prepares his  Tar∣get  for his own Defence unknowing where he aims his Vengeance while the furious Salvage makes directly at some singled Horseman who oppo∣sing his sharppointed Shield the leaping Beast is wounded deeply and while redoubling disappointed Efforts clos'd upon by the surrounding Par∣ty who discharge a shower of  Javelins  at his Body till he falls and dies a∣midst a thousand Wounds  When they shoot Wild Beasts with Pistols  BUT if  as sometimes has been known  the Man at whom the  Lyon  leaps is ignorant at his Defence and lets him seize his  Back  or  Shoulder  with a dreadfull Paw the Company no more prefer  their Sport  to their  Companions Safety  but ride in upon the  Beast  and shoot him dead with  Pistol Bul∣lets  How they hunt the Boar  THE  Boar  they often hunt  on foot  with Spears of Steel and having rows'd his bristled anger wait his coming with a  cautious Eye  and leaping from his  Tusks  as he runs swiftly by them take him  on the turn  with strange agility and strike him through the Heart with their abovenam'd  Boar Spears  How WildCats are hun∣ted  WILDCATS or Catsof  Mountains  there afford an excellent Diver∣sion they frequent the  Woods  and leap about from  Tree  to  Tree  insomuch that all who hunt them are oblig'd to wear a sort of Headpiece for 'tis very common to behold 'em jump upon the Shoulders of their  Hunters  and endeavour  so  to Wound them till they are prevented by the  Dart  or  PistolShot  of some behind them  The manner of a  Turkish  CoffeeHouse  COFFEEHOUSES are frequented by all sorts of People for 'tis  there  they meet to talk of  News  divert themselves with  Smoaking telling Stories  or hearing  Novels  read yet are these  CoffeeHouses  different from  ours  in that they only are a sort of Stalls like  Tailors Shopboards  open to the Street and capable of holding  twelve  or  fourteen Men  who meeting  there  sit  crossleg'd  for an hour or two to pass away the time which lies upon their Hands with several different kinds of innocent  Diver∣sions  Opium how and by whom taken among the  Turks  OPIUM has  in former times  been taken as a Cordial by the generali∣ty of Men among the  Turks  and certainly that Custom ow'd its Introdu∣ction to the  Prohibition  of the Use of  Wine  yet  now  'tis much disus'd and mostly practis'd by the  Lawyers Scribes  and such whose Heads are ever busied in Affairs of  great  and  high Importance  these  by constant use  be∣come enabled to digest a Quantity of force sufficient to destroy  three other Men  Its chief Effect is  for a while  to elevate the Senses to a wond'rous Pitch of  Mirth  and  Gayety  but in few hours they must renew the means or  their  agreeable  and  brisk  Deportment will be soon Transform'd to a sur∣prizing  Dullness  and  unguess'd Stupidity  An excellent Custom to en∣courage In∣dustry  THERE is an admirable Custom First  no doubt  design'd as an En∣couragement to  Industry  by so perswasive an  Example  that the  Sultan  's must profess some certain  Trade  or  Calling  so to be the better able  shou'd their Fate require it  to get their  livings  by their own HandLabour Thus some are Taught the Art of  Turning Cups  and  Balls  in  Lignum Vitae  others learn to dress up  Turbants  some make  Bows  and some  Em∣broider  every one in short who has the smallest prospect of Succession to the  Throne of Turkey  being Taught some  useful  and  Ingenious Art  to  Honour  and  Promote  Industrous Applications  I have as fully Treated of their ways of living  in this Chapter  as is needful or diverting to the  Reader  who may see thereby that tho' they boast no  Sunshine  of illustrious  Learning  nor the more  Polite  and  Ceremonious Customs  of the  Christian World  they are not altogether void of  form  and  order  in their  Publick  or their  Private Wheels of Government  Proceed we  now  to trace them to their  Graves  and see their Offices of  Mourning  and  respect  for such as having run the course of Nature drop a sleep and make their  Exits  CHAP XVI Of the  Turkish  Funerals  Moral reflecti∣ons on the con∣sequences of superstition  TO what a strange degree will  Superstition  lead astray the Minds of Mortals and how wonderfully Blinded in a Cloud of  Igno∣rance  and  Obstinacy  must our Senses lie when even the Brightest  Ray  of  Truth it self  wants force to dissipate our Errors  YET  such a Darkness  Sways the Judgment of the  Turkish Nation  nor can even the plainest demonstrations of their most  Ridiculous SelfContradictory  and  Erroneous Principles  convince them of their folly they are hardned in their  Resolutions  to persist  Ʋnthinkingly  in what they have so long  Maintain'd  and the encreasing Weight of dangerous  Pride  has shut the Door against their  Reason  The  Turks  un∣happy in a grounded ob∣stinacy  THE follies of our Lives forsake us seldom where we see them not and the unhappy  Turks  believing all their  Superstitious notions  Sacred truth  Die  as they  Live  and have as strange and unaccountable Opinions of a future State between their  Death  and gaining  Paradise  as of the  Pleasures  which they Dream will  there  present themselves Tis pity that a  People  so prodigiously Successfull and so full of  Power  shou'd be  Hoodwink'd  from the knowledge of a more  refin'd  and Hea∣venly Doctrine how true is that Expression of the  Greek Theognis  True  Wisdom  knows a more exalted Bliss  Than  Boundless Pow'r  or  Mighty Empire  is  FOR want of that the  Turks  mistake the Road to Truth and Wander both in  Life  and  Death  alike estrang'd from  reason  or the smal∣lest share of  solid  Judgment  The Ceremo∣nies us'd by the  Turks  in Sickmens Chambers  WHEN any of this People  Weak  and  Aged  by the course of Nature or  perhaps  invaded by the raging pains of a distemper'd Body are sup∣pos'd by their  Acquaintance  or  Relations  any ways in danger of ap∣proaching Death they flock in Numbers to the  Sick Mans Chamber  and endeavour to perswade him that he ought  contentedly  to meet his Fate and Chearfully resign his Soul to him who gave it making him repeated Protestations of their great affection and assurances that they had ra∣ther  Die  to keep him Company than  Live  to lose his  valued Conversation  they Sing incessantly in doleful strains a kind of  Melancholy Songs  where∣by they think they Charm the Evil Angel who attends to Kill him the subject of these Songs is the profession of their  Love  not much unlike  but far less Tuneful than  the  th  Ode of the second Book of  Horace  where he thus Addresses his  Expression  to the indispos'd  Maecenas  Hor  Ode lib  d  Cur me querelis exanimas tuis  Nec diis amicum est nec mihi te prius  Obire  Maecenas  mearum  Grande decus columenque rerum  Ah te meae si partem animae rapit  Maturior vis quid moror altera  Oh why  Maecenas  shou'd  you  thus  unkind  With your  complaining Murmurs  rack my Mind  Believe me 'tis not kind to  Heav'n  nor  me  That  you  shou'd First to  Death  a  Victim  be  You  the  great Ornament  of all my Fate  And generous  Prop  of my depending State  Ah if too  Swift a Call  this Mournful Day  Must  Snatch  my Souls dear  better half  away  Why shou'd the  other part Imperfect  longer stay  Their Cere∣monies imme∣diately on a Friends Death  BUT when the Fleeting  Breath  of the departed Mortal has forsook his Body and they find no further room for  hope  they tear their  Cloaths  and  for a while  abandon o'er their  reason  to the force of  Passion  Weeping with a  long Immoderate Sorrow  till  at last  those  Kinsmen  farthest from his Blood begin to Dry their Eyes and strive to comfort  him  whose near∣ness of Alliance to the Person of the  Deceas'd  requires him to appear  Chief Mourner  at his  Obsequies  they  First  Condole his loss and then proceed to such advice as the so late nam'd  Horace  gives his Brother Poet on the Death of  Quinctilius  Hor  Ode  d  lib  Multis ille bonis flebilis occidit  Nulli flebilior quam tibi  Virgili  Tu frustra Pius  heu  non ita creditum  Poscis  Quinctilium  Deos  He's  Dead  and when he lost his precious Breath  A Thousand  pious People  Mourn'd his  Death  Yet none  O Virgil  does  like you  complain  And ev'n  your self alas  lament in vain  For not the utmost  Pity  you can show  Will bring his  summon'd Ghost  from the dark  Shades below  THE melancholy Mourner must  a while  resist their strongest Argu∣ments but  by degrees  is brought to own with them the Notions of the same abovenam'd Author  Durum sed levius fit patientiâ  Quicquid corrigere est nefas  'Tis hard but  Patience  makes that Burthen  light  'Gainst which 'tis  vain  to  strive  and  sin  to fight  SO that when their  Tears  are dried away and they have time for  Ceremony  they proceed to do their  other Duties  in the following man∣ner  Their way of laying out dead Bodies  THE  Men  by  Men  and  Women  by the help of  their own Sex  are  in the midst of some large Room  laid out as  here in England  on a  Carpet Mat  or something meaner answerable to their Quality A Crowd of  Friends  swarm round the Body which is  naked  on the Ground and having turn'd it nine times  round and round  with Prayers and Invocations for the Mer∣cy of  Almighty God  they  lather  it with  Soap  and  Water  shaving it from  head  to  foot  with sharp edg'd Razors  AFTER this they wash it clean with  Milk  and  Water  somewhat warm  A very strange expression of respect  then tie their  Beads  or other little  Toys  about his Limbs which is a fashionable method of expressing their Affection But the strangest Custom I have ever found among the Practices of any Nation is a method they have got to wound their  Bosoms  with a  Pin  or  Bodkin  and receive as much of  their own Blood  upon their Fingers end as will enable them to write distinctly in a crimson Character their  Names  and  Ages on the Breast of the Deceas'd  How they fold the Body  THEN fold they up the Body in a  Linen Sheet  which twists about a dozen times the compass of the  Corps  but is left  open  at the  top  and  bottom  for a pleasant sort of reason which I shall  hereafter  mention and which  Superstition  has perswaded them to think  sufficient  WHEN they bear 'em to the  Grave  'tis  commonly  about the close of Day and with a numerous Train of the  Acquaintance  and  Relations  of the  late Deceas'd  the manner you will see describ'd at large in the  Cut  that is annex'd hereto but for the  Reader  's further satisfaction I will set down all the order which the  Turks  observe at the most celebrated  Funerals  of Men of high and noted Quality  Their forms of marching to a Funeral  FIRST march a Train of grave  Derveeshes  or the  Priests  of whom I spoke in a  foregoing Chapter  these bear a certain number of large  flaming Torches  and with melancholy Looks and  carefull slow  and  heavy Steps  foretell the People what is coming after them  NEXT follow other  Priests  who by their  wringing Hands  and  shaking Heads  and other such  expressive  signs of Sorrow seem as much concern'd as if the Parts they only  act  were  true  and  real  AN EXPLANATION OF THE PLATE Which Represents the Prospect of a  TURKISH FUNERAL  A A  THE Grave and People gather'd round it  B B B  The ChurchYard  C  The Torch Bearers  D D D  The Priests and hir'd Mourners  E E E E

Monaghan  n the Kingdom of Ireland Baronet  his Representation of a Turkish Funeral is Respectfully Dedicated  The  Turks  all mourn in White  THEN come several Men who bear along large  Ensigns  trailing far upon the Ground behind 'em after them  four six  or  Ten led Horses  at an equal distance led by  Grooms on foot  come slowly forward cover'd  to the Heels  with fine  white Cloth  for that's the  Turkish Mourning  treading with a  grave  and  heavy step  as if they knew the Cause of their Appea∣rance  How the Bo∣dy lies upon the Bier  NOW comes the  Body  carried on a  Bier  by four tall Men half cover'd over with the  Mourning Cloath  which falls about 'em from the  Bier  and hangs upon the Ground the  Corps  is born  head foremost  through the City wrap'd in  Linen  with his Face uncover'd and a  Turbant  at his Crown whose  shape  or  magnitude  denotes his Quality they never bury them in  Coffins  so they lie all open to the publick View bestrew'd with every  Flower  which may happen  then  to flourish  BEHIND the Corps immediately appear two venerable Priests with  Turbants  of a  large  and  stately size  who  all the way they go  with  elevated Eyes  and  Arms extended  sometimes striking furiously against their Breasts call  vehemently  on the Name of  God  pronouncing it a thousand times with  awfull Sound  and melancholy Accent  The Close of the Procession  IN the rear of the  Procession  walk his Friends in gracefull Order  two by two  with Handkerchiefs to wipe away the  Tears  they shed for  grief  or  fashion  Women go not to the  Funerals  of Men nor Men to those of Wo∣men unless it be a number for their  Safety  and performance of the Cere∣monies requisite in  Burials  Their Church yards how and where plac'd  CHURCHYARDS  among the Turks  are always plac'd without the  Town  or in some  wild  and  vacant  Place within it as for Ground they ne∣ver mind to chuse it  level Hills  and  Dales  are all alike and for the space of  sometimes  full three Miles about you see a sort of  Grove  or  Wood  if the Expression be allow'd of lofty Stones for at the  head  and  foot  of  every Grave  is plac'd a Marble of the shape and bigness of a  common Man  The only way they have to signalize the Memory of Noblemen  I mean great Officers  among them is to carve the tops of both the Stones they fasten at his Grave to represent a  Turbant  of a  size  or  form  which speaks his Qua∣lity they strow the Ground with  odoriferous Flowers  and often plant such little  Trees  and  Herbs  as are for ever  green  and  flourishing  A charitable Custom of the  Turkish  Wo∣men  Three times a Week the Women meet in all their  Coemitery  's to condole the loss of  dead Relations  with continued  howlings  for about two Hours leaving when they go away  on every Grave Meat Drink  and  Money  as a charitable Offering to the numerous Poor who afterwards come in and taking what they find  there left  do gratefully repeat a certain number of Petitions for  the Soul of the Deceas'd  proportionable to the  Alms  bestow'd upon them  Their Cere∣monies at the Grave  HITHER then they bring the Corps and coming to the  Grave  first lay it on the Earth and gather round it every one repeating Prayers for his Delivery from the Punishment of  Purgatory  for they hold as I have said before a middle State this done they bury him without a further Ceremony and filling up the Grave with Earth return again in order as they came  A very strange Notion of an Examination in the Grave  NOW says the  Turkish Doctrine  they no sooner leave the Body in the Ground but up start two  black horrid Angels  with their Hands of  Steel  and Heads of  Fire  these immediately rejoin the  Soul  and  Body  and by force oblige the frighted Wretch to  sit upright  while they with great sharp Knives of fiery Substance cut the Body widely open and examine nicely  all his Heart to see what sort of Life he led  while here on Earth  if they perceive his  good Deeds  more in number than his  evil Actions  they with humble  Congees  sneak away and in their room come  two bright Spirits  from the Realms of Bliss who lay him gently down to rest again and sit∣ting one to guard his  Head  the other to protect his  Feet  attend him so till the Great Day of  Ʋniversal Judgment  The Punish∣ments they fancy IllMen undergo  BUT if they find as  ten  to  one  they do that his  ill Actions  have sur∣pass'd his  Good ones  one  black Angel  with an  Hammer of a thousand Weight  with fury strikes him on the Head and beats him eighteen Fathoms under Ground by which time  being turn'd in passage like a Shuttlecock  the  other Fiend  receives him at the bottom with another Blow as fatal as the former and thereby sends him swiftly up again so continuing to knock him  up and down  'till  Mahomet  their Prince of Mercy shall in gracious pity of his human Frailties condescend to grant a short Reprieve which being pass'd the  bloody Executioners  strait fall to work again as roughly as before and this Opinion so prevails in their  Imaginations  that they always  in their prayers for Friends deceas'd  implore the Mercy of  Almighty God  to ease them from the Torture of the  two black Angels  And it is for these two  Fiend  's conveniency that  as I said before  the  Winding Sheet  is left unty'd at top and bottom  NINE Days  successively  the dead Man's Friends assemble  at his Grave  and pray together for the Welfare of his Soul that time of mourning over they erect a  Monument  of little cost  but not unless he was of a distin∣guish'd Quality  upon the flats whereof appear engrav'd in  Turkish Cha∣racters  the several  Graces  and  accomplish'd Excellencies  which adorn'd his  Person  with peculiar Merit while he liv'd and flourish'd  A pleasant kind of Buri∣al  SOME are buried in their Gardens and have  Tombs  built over them adorn'd with  Jessamines  and all the  odoriferous Plants  which blooming  Spring  perfumes the World with whose delightful Shades embracing with a sort of melancholy closeness the half cover'd  Pillars  of  Thebaick Mar∣ble  afford a  pleasing  and  surprizing Prospect  through a  grated Opening  in the outward Wall form'd purposely to let all Passengers behold the Monu∣ment  The Mauso∣laeums of the  Turkish  Empe∣rors  THE  Sultans  who have built large  Mosques  in  Constantinople  and who shall be spoken of in the Chapter relating to  that City  have their  rich  and stately  Mausolaeums  near the  Temples  where assemble daily numbers of poor Pilgrims who receive a certain Alms to pray for the departed Soul of him whose  Liberality  they then are blest with many Lamps are con∣stantly kept burning and a set of Priests maintain'd on purpose to inspect the Duties of the Place which are both numerous and superstitious even beyond imagination  Epitaphs of Modern use a∣mong the  Turks  'TIS seldom known that any other  Epitaph  is plac'd upon a  Tomb  than just a plain account of the  Condition Name Age Sex  and  time of Bu∣rial  of the Person there interr'd yet 'tis of  late  become a Custom with the  Richest  and  most Noble  of their People  here  and  there  to order certain short and witty Verses to be made upon the Vertues of the  Dead  and either  carv'd  or writ in  Golden Letters  on the Marble Monument I will  transcribe  and print in  English  one or two of different kinds that you may better guess their manner of composing them Here follows  one  upon the Death of  Ishmael Bashaw  the Governor of  Constantinople  who was kill'd in Bat∣tle at the great Defeat the  Turks  receiv'd in passing o'er the River  Raab  in  Hungary  to fight the  German  and  Hungarian  Forces under the Command of  General Montecuculi  on the th of  July Anno Domini    An Epitaph upon a  Turkish  General kill'd in Battle by the  Germans  Here by his two  good Angels  guarded lies  Ishmael Bashaw  in War the  German  's Prize  They kill'd him  basely  e'er the  Stream  he pass'd  He  won  but  lost  again because he  won too fast    O  Infidels  beware he who  perplext  Your Souls while in  this World  will  damn 'em  in the  Next  ANOTHER follows of a  merry Strain  upon a certain  Orange Merchant  who died in his  first Wives Arms  upon his  Wedding Night  in which they seem to shew a love of  Puns  by jesting on his Pro∣fession  An Epitaph upon a Man who died in his Wives Arms on his Wedding Night  Alas alas  here free from  Cares  and  Strife  Lies  one embrac'd to death  by his first Wife  Had'st thou been sow'r as  Persian Limons  are  Thou had'st not met a  Fate  so  sharp  so  rare    But as thou wa'st an  Orange  thou art dead  For  Women  love such  Sweetness  ev'n in Bed  And  she  who by thee chanc'd that  Night  to lie  Tasted  thee found thee  sweet  and quickly  suck'd thee dry  I cou'd insert some others which I now have by me but the two  a∣bovewritten  will suffice to shew their  Genius  and the  Turkish  tast of  Wit in Epitaphs  CHAP XVII Of the Publick and Private Buildings of  Turkey  The Reason why the  Turks  neglect great  Buildings  AMONGST the various and innumerable Follies which possess the  Turks  they boast  one Prudence  and maintain it with an Argu∣ment that is 'Tis  indiscreet  and next to madness to employ their Thoughts and constant Labours in the raising  lofty  and  stu∣pendious Palaces  whose solid Forms may probably outlive the very Memo∣ry of their  forgotten Founders  Why shou'd we  cry the  Turks bestow our Cares and Riches on the vain Contrivance of magnificent and stately Stru∣ctures when we neither know if we shall live  to Morrow  nor are sure to leave our sumptuous Habitations to an  Heir  's  Possession  of our  Race  or our Religion  Horace  wisely in his  second Book  and  eighteenth Ode  reproves this Folly  Hor  Ode Lib  Tu secanda marmora  Locas sub ipsum funus sepulchri  Immemor struis domos  In  hewing Marble  all thy Hours  Unthinking Wretch roll on  When the swift Call of  Death  's keen Pow'rs  Shall snatch thee  hence  anon  In building  Palaces  of State  You waste your  measur'd Breath  Vainly affecting to look  Great  Ʋnmindfull  of your  Death  The ancient Buildings of  Greece  quite ruin'd and forgotten  NOR are there  now  remaining many of those  vast  and  unexampled  Buildings of  Antiquity  whose stately Spires and venerable Piles in  former times  were wont to crown the face of  Greece  with an amazing Majesty almost all those ancient Marks of  Pride  and  Grandeur  are entirely ruin'd and effac'd from even the nicest ken of curious Observation and if any yet remain they are so  mouldred  and  deform'd  by penetrating time and  Ages Injuries  that they will hardly serve to any other end than the presenting a  Memento  to the Frailties of  Mortality  and  telling lookers on  with a prevailing  Silence  and the  horrid Marks  of an experienc'd desolation what  Ausonius  says when he declares that  Mors etiam saxis nominibusque venit  How wide alas does  Death  's  Dominion  fly  When ev'n our  Names themselves  and  Stones  must die  The Publick Buildings more magni∣ficent  THE  Turks  however negligent in the  magnificent  and  lasting Structure  of their Houses spare  no Pains no Art nor Money  in their Publick Buildings such as  Mosques  or  Churches Bagnio  's  Hans  and  Hospitals  which with their common dwelling Houses form the Subject of this  Chapter  and shall  at large  be treated of in their respective Places  The situation of their Mosques  AND first their  Mosques  as dedicated to the Service of the  Great Al∣mighty  tho' in an  erroneous  and  mistaken  way of Worship claim our Obser∣vation They are ever situated on some elevated Hill or rising spot of Ground thereby appearing more  majestically Great  and Tow'ring the common ones are seldom found so stately as our  Country Churches  and may be more particularly conceiv'd if the Reader will be pleas'd to look upon the Form exactly represented in the Figure mark'd by the Letter  O  in the  Cut  of a  Graecian Wedding  in the one and twentieth Chap∣ter  BUT the  Royal Mosques  or such as have  from Age to Age  been founded by the mighty  Turkish Emperors  deserve a more particular and full Descri∣ption which take as follows  The  Turks  un∣skill'd in the ancient Or∣ders of Archi∣tecture  first observing that the  Turks  unskill'd in an∣cient Orders of  Iönick Dorick  or  Corinthian Buildings  practice methods independent on the Customs of our  Europaean Architecture  and proceed by measures altogether  new  and owing to the Product of their own  In∣vention  The descrip∣tion of a Royal  Turkish  Mosque  THEY are built entirely of a  spotless White  and  shining Marble  round in form and rising to a large and stately  Cupola  supported nobly by a  double  sometimes  treble  row of Pillars of a different Order each from other yet without a Name whereby I can express them in the  British Language  their  Capitals  and  Bases  are not seldom form'd of  Brass  and frequently the  Columns  ring'd about with a continued Piece of  twining Carv'dWork  of that very Marble which composes the  Pillar  sometimes other Workmanship adorns them not unlike that rais'd Work which  Italian Architects  distin∣guish  by the Name of  Basso relievo  very often they are left quite plain but admirably polish'd by an Art which gives them  lasting Lustre  A sort of Turret not unlike the Monument in  London  THE  Capitals  of these high Pillars support not only the abovenam'd  Dome  or  Cupola  but a broad Marble  Gallery  which running round the whole Circumference at several Doors admits an ent'rance from  four six  or  eight  tall  Turrets  which surround the outside of the  Mosque  and are e∣rected of an equal  magnitude  from  top to bottom  rising from the Ground and reaching half as high again as to the  Center  of the  Cupola  at equal distance from each other every  Turret  is adorn'd with  two three  sometimes  four  large  Tarrasses  exactly like the  Gallery  upon the Monument on  FishstreetHill  in  London  whence  Priests  appointed for that Duty call the People to assemble in the  Mosques  at their divided Hours of Prayer  A glorious Appearance  THE  Cupola  's which often are surrounded with an hundred others small and close together like  a bunch of Grapes  are with these small ones richly  gilded  as are frequently the  Spires  of the abovenam'd  Turrets  so that the  Sunbeams  reflected  gloriously  from their all dazling Lustre strike the Eyes of  gazing Strangers  with a sort of  new surprizing  Plea∣sure  Religious Washing Places  ROUND the bottom of the outward Building are erected many  Ci∣sterns  curiously contriv'd with brazen  Cocks  affording Water for the Cere∣monious Washings of the zealous  Turks  who hold it an unpardonable Crime to enter any  Mosque  before their Bodies are prepar'd by  Washings  as directed by the Precepts of their  Prophet Mahomet  The fineness of the  Marble  sides and floors  A stately  Portico  admits them to these  Mosques  of wonderfull contri∣vance and extensive  magnitude  here all who enter leave their Slippers and advance  barefooted  upon  Mats  or  Carpets  which are spread at large and cover neatly all the Floor which with the sides is flagg'd with admi∣rable Squares of polish'd Marble join'd so closely that in many Places 'tis a difficult attempt to undertake a quick discovery of any Joynt  Images esteem'd Idolatrous  ALL Images as I have said before are so abhorr'd by the  Mahometans  that they esteem it an Idolatrous Offence to have 'em in their Houses so that  consequently  they are never found in  Mosques  or Places consecrated to the Practice of Religion  The use of  Niches  in the  Turkish Mosques  yet tho' Images are disallow'd the compass of the  inner Wall  of all their  Mosques  is full of  Niches  such as in the  Europaean Piles  contain fine  Statues  but are here appointed to another use for be∣ing  large  and  deep  beyond the  Christian Form  they fill the surface of those  spacious Hollows  with the  oftrepeated  Names of  God  and  Mahomet  in broad and shining  Golden Characters  FROM the  great Gallery  which I  just now  inform'd you was supported by the  Capitals  of those vast rows of  Pillars  which secure the  Building  cer∣tain broad and stately Arches  sloping downwards  through the Body of the Church between the  Columns  and the bottom of the  Cupola  surprize a Stranger with a distant Prospect of the sides of the  Mosque  and all within it terminating nobly in the  latenam'd Niches  rendred stately by the golden Names of  God  and  Mahomet  WITHIN the Temples ever burn prodigious Numbers of  Glass Lamps  which hang about ten Foot above the Ground illuminating  Day and Night  the Body of the  Church  with a surprizing Brightness and re∣quiring such an  annual Charge  for the supply of  Oyl  and  Cotton  that  Reve∣nues  are appropriated to that single use and such amazing Numbers still continue burning in their  Royal Mosques  that I dare hardly hope belief  when I inform my Reader that in the  Mosque  call'd  Sancta Sophia  at  Constantinople  An incredible Number of e∣verburning Lamps  no fewer  Lamps  are always lighted than  Thirty Thousand  and some outward  Odd Ones  A Descripti∣on of the  Turk∣ish  Bagnio's  TO every  Mosque  belongs a  Bagnio  which as much frequented by the  Turish People  is esteemed a Building of no small Importance these are  of∣ten  tho' not  always  built of Marble  Square  and  Spacious  all divided into ma∣ny and convenient Chambers  Sweating Rooms  and  Cooling Baths  which each makes use as he finds himself inclin'd in every one of these Divi∣sions  different Cocks of Brass  admit what quantity of Water  Hot  or  Cold  they think convenient and since  as I have said before  the  Men  and  Women  knowing constantly the Hours of eithers Bathing never offer at immodest Entrance there is no Precaution taken to prevent an In∣solence the Laws of  Turkey  Punish so severely All the Doors are  therefore  carelessly left open and the Modestest of all their Women  Wives  or  Virgins  Bath securely in unguarded Nakedness as never apprehending they are liable to any kind of Danger  A Merry Sto∣ry of an  Eng∣lish  Cook who caught some  Turkish  Ladies Naked in a Bagnio  YET what withholds the Bold presumption of a  curious Ignorance  'tis not many Years ago since an Assembled Company of  Naked Ladies  were unexpectedly surpriz'd by an Adventurous  Tarpawlin  Cook on Board an  English Merchant Ship  then lying in the Harbour He was Rambling up and down about the City when coming by a  Turkish Bag∣nio  built of Marble  Round  and not extreamly  Large  he took it for a  Cockpitt  and perceiving Nobody deny'd him Entrance was resolv'd to see a little Sport so in he went but had not pass'd two outward Rooms before he made a full discovery of his mistake and  something else  which the poor  Frighted Ladies  Shreik'd their Anger at but the Attendants of the  Bagnio  being  Naked  in performance of their Office and the  Starting Britain  nimble Heel'd and  Quick  to Apprehend his danger He escap'd and ran directly to his Fellows whom he left upon the Waterside and got  on board  without suspicion so that he can truly boast he was  EyeWitness  of a Curiosity unknown perhaps till then to the most esteem'd and favourite Breast of any  Christian  A Description of the  Turkish  Hans  NEXT come their  Han  's a sort of Square Stone Buildings for the Entertainment and Reception of  promiscuous Travellers  some of these have  Lodgings  and Conveniencies of  Diet  to deliver  Gratis  to whosoever asks it which has been the gift of some  Deceas'd Rich Officer  as are indeed most Buildings of this kind throughout all  Turkey  OTHERS only give them Room for  Carriages  and  Cattle  which are Rang'd  in Rows  along the Middle of the  Han  whose Sides are all di∣vided into large  Partitions  each whereof contains a  Chimney  where the Company who take it up may dress their  Meat  and Sleep on  Mats  if Weariness inclines them for nothing else can possibly occasion even the least repose in such a Wretched Place with such Companions as are generally met withal and in the midst of such  confus'd  and strange variety of endless  Noises  The Inconve∣niency of  Turkish  Hospi∣tals  INFIRMARIES  or  Hospitals  are commonly  Stone Buildings  of a large  Quadrangular  design not much unlike  our own  but that the  Beds  lie open to each other no  Apartments  being form'd to keep the  Sick  of one Distemper from  Diseases of another kind  but in∣considerately exposing all to Publick View and dangerous Conver∣sation  Description of their common Dwelling Houses  NOW let us look upon their common Houses and we shall perceive them  poor  and  mean  illcontriv'd and never higher than one single  Story  they are generally built I mean the Frames of  green unseason'd Timber  cas'd with  Mud  or  unbak'd Bricks  half hard'ned in the  Sun  which is the cause that yielding to the  Weather  they can seldom stand above ten Years without expensive trouble in a general Repair and another Inconvenience which attends their way of Building is that by the  sudden Moistures  and as  sudden Heats  these Bricks are subject to a sort of  black  and  deadly Scorpi∣ons  breed so frequently in all their Walls that I have had them  often  fall upon my Cloaths as I have  walk'd about  their finest Houses  THE meanest of their Buildings rise a little in the  Roof  and form a  low  and  archlike Ridge  defended from the Rain by  Slates  or  Tiles  of odd con∣trivance and have a sort of  Gallery  or  Balcony  built quite round them  Description of their finest Houses  The  better sort  are sometimes rais'd to moderate heighth by an  unpolish'd  kind of Stone of greyish Colour they open from the Street with  low  and  illmade wooden Doors  to spacious  Courts  or  Yards  which lead 'em to an illcon∣triv'd and timber  Staircase that  admits 'em to an Hall where wait Attendants at a Door which opens into the  more rich  and  private Cham∣bers  ROUND the abovenam'd CourtYard are the several Offices as  Stables Kitchen Cellar Buttery  and the other necessary Places in a Great Man's Family  Pleasant Rooms  THE best Apartments tho' not stately are beyond imagination  pleasant  and  agreable  for some are floor'd with  Oak  all cover'd over with fine  Mats  or  Carpets  painted on the Sides and  Cieling  with an hundred various Colours richly intermix'd with  Gold  and  Silver  and adorn'd with little Wands of  Deal  cut long and in a semicircular form the Flats where∣of are glew'd on  cross ways  to the colour'd Roof and form a sort of square confusion or  agreable irregularity one half  of all these Rooms is rais'd about a Foot above  the other  call'd the  Saffrai  which I have  before  occasionally mention'd and is generally that side of any Room which looking out up∣on the  Gardens  adds a double beauty to the Place it self which is alone  sufficiently agreable  by being cover'd with the richest Carpets and surrounded on the sides with fine  embroidred Velvet Cushions  upon which they  sit  or  lean by Day  to  eat drink talk  or entertain their Family  How the  Tur∣kish  Beds are made  and where  at Night  their  Beds  are made not soft with  Down  but stuff'd with  Camel  's  Hair Sheeps Wool  or  Cotton  OTHER Rooms are pav'd with fine and various colour'd Marble having  Fountains  of a round triangular square oval or what other form their Fancy leads 'em to make choice of in the midst of the Apartment  A melancholy but delight∣full Amuse∣ment  and several others trickling gently from the hollow Wall and falling with a sort of melancholy murmuring upon thin Shells of  Brass  contriv'd on purpose to resound the Notes of the complaining Waters and compleat thereby the dulcid  Entertainment  of a  charming natural  and yet  uncommon Harmony  THE  Turks  delight extreamly in a  Country Life  retiring often to some rural Seat to please themselves in Solitude to which end also they have very  large  and  costly Gardens  to their City Houses where tho' 'tis allow'd they neither  know  nor  covet Christian  Arts of Planting  Flowers  and marking out their Ground in  orderly Divisions    The  Turkish  Gardens form a sort of na∣tural Paradise  they yet contrive so charmingly to imitate  soft Natures Sweetness  in their  Wildernesses Groves  and  shady Bowers  that walking underneath the Covert of the meeting Boughs and undistinguish'd Avenues they seem possess'd of that  Elyzian Happiness  de∣scrib'd as follows by  Tibullus  Sed me quod facilis tenero sum semper amori  Ipsa Venus campos ducet Elysios  Hic Choreae cantusque vigent passimque vagantes  Dulce sonant tenui gutture carmen aves  Fert casiam non culta seges totosque per agros  Floret odoratis terra benigna rosis  Ad juvenum series teneris immista puellis  Ludit assiduè praelia miscet amor  Since  gentle Love  with ease my Heart invades  Venus  shall guide me to  Elyzian Shades    There Songs  and  Dances  swell full tides of Joy  And  Birds  from  Tree  to  Tree  their Wings employ  Stretching  for dulcid Strains  their tunefull Throats  And  chanting  Harmony in  warbling Notes  Ʋncultivated Shrubs  yield  Cassia  there  And  all the  kindly Soil does  fragrant Roses  bear  There  lovely Nymphs  with  amorous Shepherds  toy  Mix'd by  kind Love  in  Skirmishes of Joy  IT may not be improper under the Head of  Turkish Building  to intro∣duce a Word or two concerning their  Skill  in the Art of  Fortificati∣on  which far inferior to the  Christian Practice  you may take as fol∣lows  The  Turkish  Art of Forti∣fication  THEY have no Opinion of the lofty  Bastions Hornworks Ravelins Counterscarps Tenaille  's or  Outworks  of the  Christians  but level all their  Modern Works  within a little of the Ditches which surround 'em which tho' less chargeable they hold as  efficacious  to oppose  Approaches  as the other Method But their chief  security  and whole  dependance  is in undermining all their Works which they do so dexterously that by sinking one below another they can  blow up Bullwarks  after they are taken  three several times  so often ruining the Efforts of their  Enemies  The  Turks  the best Defen∣ders of a Town and why  THE  Turks  of any Nation are the best in the defence of Towns Be∣sieg'd for  Priests  or  Politicks  have craftily infus'd a Notion in their Minds that he who being  garrison'd  in any  Fort  belonging to the  Sultan  lives to see the  Infidels  possess it shall not only lose his  Prophet  's  Favour  but forever be excluded from the future Blessings of  expected Para∣dise  The  Turkish  Prisons few and weak and why  I shou'd add a little of the  Turkish Prisons  which the Reader may  perhaps  expect of  Strength  and  Number  in proportion to their  Cruelty  and  Arbitrary Power  which the  Sultan  exercises but that very Cruelty is  on the contrary  the only reason why there are  in Turkey  very  few  and those weak  Prisons  for the  Justice  or  Injustice  of the Sentence which condemns a Criminal of any kind is so speedily inflicted that there frequently are known but fourteen Hours between the  Crime  and  Execution  so that any Place will hold  the Guilty  since for reasons mention'd in the Part forego∣ing an  Escape from Justice  is esteem'd  impracticable  CHAP XVIII Of the City of  Constantinople  The Antiqui∣ty of  Constan∣tinople  THIS Great and Famous  Town  the Subject of this Chapter and an ancient Seat of Grandeur and Authority was built about the time wherein the  Persian Empire  flourish'd o'er the  Eastern World  her Founder's Name was  Byza  whence she took her first deno∣mination of  Byzantium  and continued an  obscure  and inconsiderable City till the Reign of  Pausanias King of Sparta  When Con∣quer'd by the  Romans  TO him it fell the Prize of War he won it by Assault and glorious∣ly rebuilt enlarg'd and strengthen'd it insomuch that long enjoying peacefull Plenty she continued  Mistress  of a fix'd Security and after three Years vigorous Defence became a dear and bloody  Victim  to the conque∣ring Army of  Severus  an ambitious  Roman Emperor  How rendred Great and Glorious  SHE chang'd her  Masters  but continued notwithstanding in the same Condition as to  Power  or  Character  till the Choice of that illustrious  Chri∣stian Emperor Constantine the Great  distinguish'd her by bright and shining Honours from all other Cities stripping  Rome  of all her Glories to adorn this happy Favorite of his Fancy and in short removing from the  Western World  the mighty Seat of universal Empire to dignifie this  new Elected Eastern City  with that envied Title and conferring on his rich and stately Residence the celebrated Name of  Constantinople  thereby expressing that he plac'd her Welfare in an equal balance with his own Prosperity and had elected that one Place of all the World to be the proud and splendid  Scene  of his amazing  Grandeur  TO draw Inhabitants from  Rome  to this new City he decreed that Citizens and Freemen of the one shou'd all  of course  be free of t'other robbing  Italy  of many Monuments of Conquest and Antiquity and tran∣splanting endless Numbers to  Constantinople  How long it flourish'd  which continued from the Year of  Christ  to in all the Glories of unrival'd Plenty and ex∣tended Power under a successive Race of formidable Monarchs who possess'd a large and uncontroul'd Dominion over distant Territories and enroll'd the Glories of their Great  Metropolis  in the Politest nay the fore∣most Leaf of  Fame  's bright  Register  But how uncertain and delusive are the Honours of Mortality And all the shining Trains of  Pageantry  which join to flatter us with promis'd  Fortune  What Condition of our frail  Humanity  is  permanent  or  solid  Or as  Juvenal  has it in his  tenth Satyr  Juv  Sat  Quae praeclara prospera tanti  Ʋt rebus laetis par sit mensura malorum  Where can be found that  uncomplaining  State  Or where the  Master  of so  blest  a Fate  That they can  freely  and sincerely say  Ours is a  griefless Joy  and Bliss  without  Allay  When  Constan∣tinople  was ta∣ken by the  Turks  AMBITION and the wild distractions of intestine Discords shook  at last  to worse than nothing that  divided Empire  and involv'd her Chil∣dren in a bloody Ruin by the conquering Arms of  Turkish Enemies  who in the Year abovenam'd won by storm that miserable City which with  different Fortunes  has born  different Names  and reign'd by turns the fam'd  Metropolis  and favour'd Residence of the ancient  Roman Graecian  and the present  Turkish Emperors  who now have chang'd her Name from  Constanti∣nople  to  Stambole  Her present  Turkish  Name  the  Etymology  of which  Arabian Word  is by the  Turks  in∣terpreted  Fair Peace and Plenty  Moral  Refle∣ctions on the instability of Fortune  LEARN O Mortals  by the Fate of Empires  not to swell imprudent Thoughts with Sails of Pride for any  frail  and  transitory  Gifts of fickle For∣tune when you plainly see how roughly she insults and swiftly tyranni∣zes over boundless Monarchies whose  unimagin'd Paleness  of  to days  decli∣ning State so strongly gives the  lye  to the deceitfull  gloss  of glittering Yester∣day Well judg'd the  Greek  who thus defin'd her fickle Nature  Fortune  makes wretched  humane  things her sport  And triumphs from the  Hovel  to the  Court    Those who but just before she downward hurl'd  She lifts again to shine above the World  Whilst he she  late  exalted to the Skies  Is thrown to  Beds of Clay  and on vile Dunghills lies  The Beauties and Conveni∣encies of  Con∣stantinople  LET us then proceed to view this City in her modern Dress  perhaps  not less illustrious tho' more enslav'd than when she shon the  Empress  of the gazing Universe her Situation  as I have before observ'd  has open'd all the Gates of Plenty and Command to her unbounded  Sway  and  Traffick  and the unexampled Beauties of the Prospects she affords are such as render her the Seat of Pleasure and the Paradise of Nature  Her form and situation  THE Town is built of form  triangular  and lies upon a  Cape  of Land which gently rises with a smooth  acclivity  to a considerable imminence of Ground The  Eastern  side is water'd by the  Bosphorus  or  Channel  which divides the  Euxine  from the  Hellespontic Sea  about seven Leagues in  length  in breadth three quarters of an  English Mile  A spacious  Haven  of une∣qual'd depth security and beauty lies upon its  Northern Line  and to the  West  'tis bounded by the Continent  The circuit of the Town and how for∣tified  THE Compass of the Town is sixteen Miles surrounded strongly by a  triple Wall  with  Towers  and Ditches the remaining labour of the ancient  Greeks  whose  Arms  and  Names  are yet perceivable carv'd  here  and  there  upon the Stones  Five Gates  of four and twenty open to the Land and  nine∣teen  look upon the  Sea  or  Haven  into which no Ship can come which does not first pass almost closely by the Point of the  Great Turk  's  Seraglio  which compleatly forms one  Angle  of the City and the Buildings rising gradu∣ally on seven easy Hills  each  crown'd with a magnificent and stately  Mosque  whose Spires and Domes are richly gilded and most strangely in∣termix'd with Groves of  Cypress  in the Gardens of their Houses form a Scene so lovely and surprizing that the ravish'd Traveller believes himself approaching to a Place no less agreeable than was the fam'd  Elyzium  of the ancient Poets  A wonderfull Disappoint∣ment  BUT nothing can be possibly a greater Disappointment than I found at entrance all those bright and golden Glories which had tempted at a di∣stance lost their Beauties in a nearer View  The Illcondi∣tion of the Town of  Con∣stantinople  and I instead of an expected  Heaven  was amaz'd to find a  Hell  of darkness narrow Streets with dir∣ty Causeways on each broken side and Windows hanging over almost meeting in a dark conjunction low mudd Cottages and wide divisions all o'ergrown with  Grass  or  Bushes  and unpleasant Prospects of dead Walls and crooked Lanes no Glass in any of their Windows but instead there∣of old rotten  Lettices  half stuff'd with  dirty Rags  of various Colours and half cover'd over with a sort of thick white pasted Paper every thing in short but their great Buildings such as  Mosques  or  Bagnio's Han's  or  Palaces  of powerfull  Officers  meanly representing to a Stranger's View the roughest side of  shamefull Poverty  seeming to upbraid the base Inhabitants with their dejected  Slavery  in all the shocking Marks of miserable  Ser∣vitude  HOWEVER many stately Publick Edifices well deserve a full de∣scription and in order thereunto omitting purposely the Great  Se∣raglio  the  SouthWestWall  whereof divides it from the City because I shall discourse  apart  of that proud Palace of the  Turkish Tyrants  in in the nineteenth Chapter I proceed to speak of all things else in proper Order  The Sultan visits  Sancta Sophia  every Friday  AND first among the many  Royal Mosques  which crown the highest Places in  Constantinople  none comes near the fam'd  Sophia  standing not far distant from the  Sultan  's Palace who resorts thereto  each Friday  in a publick State By the description of this  one  the others Stateliness may easily be comprehended  'TWOU'D be a needless labour to repeat the form since what I men∣tion'd in the foregoing Chapter may sufficiently inform the Reader as to that particular it shall suffice to say that as no humane Imagination can conceive its wonderfull Magnificence no mortal Pen can possibly describe it  A description of that glori∣ous Temple  'Tis in short a faultless and unequal'd  Edifice  yet not the Work of  Turkish Architects  for 'twas erected in the Reign of the Emperor  Justinian  and remains unrival'd  Queen of Temples  notwithstanding more than half her  beauteous  Ornaments have been maliciously defac'd by  Turkish Supersti∣tion  How much it has been de∣fac'd by  Tur∣kish  Supersti∣tion  FOR all that excellent  Mosaic Work  which so amazingly adorn'd the  Floor  and  Sides  with shining Figures of a thousand various Forms and Co∣lours is  at present  either hid by Mats and Carpets effac'd by Iron Instru∣ments or quite daub'd over with an  Inchthick Plaster  The Stone and Brazen  Statues  of the  Graecian  Emperors have lost their Heads and are be∣come disguis'd by the repeated Efforts of licentious Insolence The deep and admirable  Cisterns  which were form'd amidst the Vaults belonging to that Temple and supplied with Water from stupendious  Aquaeducts  now almost ruin'd by the mouldring rust of Time and base Effects of Sloth and Ignorance  Her further Encomiums  YET is the  venerable Pile  in spite of Accident adorn'd with such a Sacred Lofty and  Majestic Aspect  that her tow'ring Roof bright gilded  Dome  and artfull  Cupola's  her  marble Pillars  and unnumbred Ornaments combine to strike an awfull Reverence thro' the Breasts of Strangers ob∣liging them to own they see in  Her  a sort of shining Glory which our modern Buildings in their richest Splendour fail to equalize  A Sweating Pillar  AMONGST the numerous Rarities this  Church  affords there is a large black Marble Pillar plated from the  Basis  to the  Capital  with Sheets of Copper which at certain Hours of every Day throughout the Year emits a sort of vap'rous Moisture and is therefore call'd the Sweating Co∣lumn whence this odd Effect shou'd probably arise I cannot guess but 'tis the common Notion of both  Turks  and  Graecians  that it was the Pillar whereunto the  Officers  of  Pilate  bound our  Saviour  when they scourg'd him and  upon this only ground  perswaded to believe the Drops afford some secret  Blessing  or prevailing  Vertue  you may see great numbers of promiscuous People wiping off the Moisture with their Cloaths or Foreheads some expecting by its sovereign Power to be protected from the least Misfortune  A Door of  Noah  's Ark  FOUR  Doors  it boasts of stately heighth and curious Workmanship the Wood whereof the largest is compos'd is said to be a part of  Noah'sArk  and therefore being purposely left open in some

transport  Description of the Hippo∣drom  WITHIN the View of the abovenam'd Temple stands the  Hip∣podrom  a large round Spot of Ground like  LincolnsInnFields  surrounded with the best and noblest Buildings of the City about the middle of this spacious Circle stands a very large and stately  Obelisk  of rich  Thebaick Marble  on one Pedestal whereof may be discover'd these remains of some

three distinct corners of the City in the figure of a just proportio∣nal  Triangle  what the meaning of this ancient  Hieroglyphick  was is now unknown but this is certain that the  Turks  have had some grounds to look upon it as an  ominous  remain of  Magic Skill  since just two Months be∣fore the  Deposition  of their  Sultan Ibrahim  one Head fell off as if it had been saw'd which being fastned on again by some Ingenious Artist kept its Place as firm as ever  An ominous Observation  but about a Month before that great Rebellion some Years since which ended in the  Sultan  's Death and total ruin of his favo∣rite  Officers another Head  fell off and was attended by as fatal Consequences as the former  Another Obe∣lisk of seve∣ral Stones  ANOTHER  Obelisk  not far from thence consisting of a wondrous number of large Stones cemented artfully together now entirely ruin'd  so as scarce to represent the form it bore upon its  Basis  wears an ancient  Greek Inscription  so defac'd by Time that 'tis a needless trouble to insert the broken Characters  Constantine  's Pillar  THE  Pillar  commonly distinguish'd by the Name of  Constantine  's stands tolerably whole but

and most prodigi∣ous Cistern  BENEATH this celebrated  Hippodrom  there is a very deep and vaulted  Cistern  of incredible Extent and formerly supplied with Water by a subterraneous Passage in such plenty that when  Constantinople  was in∣vested fatally by  Mahomet the Great  it yielded daily a sufficient quantity for all the numerous Inhabitants but whether  Avarice  or their depen∣dance on their Strength has made the  Turks  neglect repairing it I cannot tell 'tis now quite ruin'd all the Walls being fallen in and rend'ring the  Cistern  consequently unfit for any future use or service  Whence it took the Name of  Hippodrom  THIS Place was call'd the  Hippodrom  from the  Greek Word  which signifies a  HorseCourse  and to that sole use it was of  old  appointed The  Turks  at  present  call it  Hatmahdan  which is as much as  Riding Place  in  English  'Tis here each  Friday  that the most accomplish'd HorseMen of the  Turkish Court  and  Army  meet in Parties to encounter one another in the hurling the  Geritts  which I so lately spoke of They do it always with such wonderfull dexterity that tho' their  Darts  are blunt they imitate exactly even the roughest Shocks of  real War  nor in their strange agility of Body come below those youthfull  Hero's  whom the tunefull  Virgil  celebrates as follows in his fifth  Aeneid  Virg  Aen  Postquam omnem laeti consessum

Histori∣cal Pillar  IN the Womens Market which the  Turks  distinguish by the Name of  AuharatBaasar  stands a  Column  of prodigious height and such a curious Workmanship that being full even from the  Basis  to the  Capital  with  Hieroglyphic Figures  representing in a twining manner by  Towns Castles Ships  and  Horsemen Battles  and a thousand other strange Devices all the Rise and Progress of the  Graecian Empire  from its original Successes the Fi∣gures are contriv'd of such proportionable Magnitude that both the high∣est and the lowest seem alike  The Author enters it and what he found there  This Pillar  like the Monument at London  is not solid but  within  to be ascended by a strong and winding Staircase where the curious  Enterer  finds not any thing that's worth his Observation but the Names of Travellers of every Country cut upon the Stones to tell succeeding Comers who were there before them I perceiv'd among them  all  but three that I cou'd think were

doubtless that Ingenious Gentleman who has so much oblig'd the World with his polite and learned Observations on the  Eastern  Countries  BUT now methinks I feel  in writing it  that weighty Grief which seiz'd my Spirits when I  saw  the poor remains of  ruin'd Majesty  the great and glorious Palace of the mighty  Constantine  where  Honour  breath'd as in her native Element and all the Vertues which adorn the Mind of Man conspir'd to render  good  a Court whose  Greatness  and  Magnificence  could possibly admit of no Addition even this rich Court with all its ancient State and Grandeur is so strangely chang'd amidst the unexampled Mi∣series of poor subverted  Greece  that those tall Roofs once shining brightly in a dress of Gold are tumbled with the Columns which supported them and lie confus'd in heaps of Rubbish scarce deserving even the Name of Ruins  The Palace of  Constantine  the Great now made a Stable for wild Beasts  Those bright Apartments which in former times were wont to shine with ornamental  Balls  and glorious Crowds of celebrated  Beauties  are  at present  made a Den or Stable for the several sorts of  Wild  and  For∣rest Beasts  which serve the Pleasures of the haughty  Sultan  HERE may the  Proud Man  read his Fate and see in the Example of this fallen Empire which by the haughty Reigns of her insulting Monarchs grew  divided  and was consequently weaken'd more and more till all her Discords ended in her Downfall How admirable are the Notions of the great  Tragaedian  upon this Particular  Sen  Trag  of  Troas  Violenta nemo imperia continuit

I have already nam'd of all those glorious Monuments of  Art  and Splendour which  in former times  adorn'd this City  Modern Buildings  as describ'd in the foregoing Chapter are not wanting but as none deserves particular re∣mark  The number of Mosques in  Constantinople  I only will inform you that the  Turks  compute the number of their  Mosques  at  Constantinople  to exceed Seven Thousand  BUT the Reader must not here mistake my meaning as confin'd to the wall'd Town alone for they include the Cities following joining all in one denomination as we do that of  Westminster  with  London  The City  Scutary  THE old  Chrysopolis  at present  Scutary  a  Bythinian  City standing  op∣posite  upon the other Shore of the abovenam'd  Bosphorus  contains within her Bounds a great  Seraglio  of the  Turkish Sultans  and is large and weal∣thy not much less than three Miles round  The City  Pera  PERA Galata  or  Cornu Byzantium anciently  reaches with considera∣ble breadth from the opposite Shore of the  Haven  much above an  English Mile  with steep a scent even to the very  summit  of the Hills which over∣look the City  The use of a Seraglio there  here is likewise a  Seraglio  of the  Sultans  serving as a Prison to receive at each triennial View of the  Grand Signiors Women  whole Shoals of  barren sick  or  antiquated Ladies  ALL the Ministers of Foreign  Christian Princes  have their Dwelling Houses in some part of  Pera  seldom suffer'd to reside within the Walls of  Constantinople  the Buildings of this Town are somewhat larger and more stately than the other all the  Christian Factories  residing there  The Christian Privileges there  and favour'd with a sort of privileg'd Immunity among themselves possessing a large Place thence term'd the  FrankStreet  or the Street of  French Men  for the  Turks  in common Talk call  every Christian  by that Name who  there  with pleasure live promiscuously enjoying  almost uncontroul'd  an envied liber∣ty which very rarely any  Turk  presumes to make Encroachments on tho' some have often  insolence  enough to threaten it  SOME other Suburbs such as those without the Gate of  Adrianople  where the  Turkish Sultans  at a certain  Tomb  of some old Prophet are in∣vested with their Power spread themselves about and much enlarge the compass of the City which if taken altogether  A comparison of  London  with  Constan∣tinople  does indeed possess a a greater space of Ground than  London  but by reason of the  Gardens  join'd to every House and many  vacant Places  of the Town can  notwithstanding  boast scarce half her number of Inhabitants  The Sultan common Landlord of most Houses  THE Houses or the greatest Part of  Constantinople  are the  Sultan  's Property who lets 'em out at different Rents according to their Value and appoints Collectors to receive the Profits thence arising  Besisteens their use and description  BESISTEENS  or large and  highroof'd  Places built of  Timber  or sometimes of  Stone  are publick Markets not unlike our  Old Exchange  where Goods of every kind are bought and sold each  Mystery  or  Trade  possessing a peculiar  Row  or  Walk  Hither resort both  Turks  and  Christians  who wou'd purchase any thing of worth for  only here  they can procure it all the Streets  directly contrary to ours  made dark and close in  Front  no Shops appearing in them worth the notice of a  Stranger  or  Inhabi∣tant  The form of  Turkish  Wher∣ries  THE Persons who inhabit the opposite sides of the  Haven  corre∣spond at ease by means of many thousand  Boats  perpetually rowing up and down call'd  Kaicks  of  long  and  narrow  form a little rising at each end and  widening  in the middle not unlike an open'd  Beanshell  And now I mention their conveniencies of Rowing I will venture to digress a little way in order to divert you with a Story common in the Mouth of every  Waterman  who rows you  by  a  Castle  founded on a  Rock  that stands sur∣rounded by the Water at about two Furlongs distance from the Town of  Scutary  The  Maiden  Tower  THIS  Fort  for such 'tis  now  is call'd by the Inhabitants the  Maiden Tower  it is strong and well defended by five and twenty  Cannons  of conside∣rable Bore the Sea between the Town and it runs thirteen Fathom deep yet is it plentifully stor'd with cool fresh Water by a spacious subterra∣neous Passage which admitting it from a  large Brook  not far from  Scutary  it finds a Channel and emits vast quantities from a prodigious  Well  within the  Tower  running thence through hollows in the  Rock  and mixing with the Waters which surround the  Castle  THE Story which they tell is somewhat odd but may divert the Reader or at least will serve him as a  Moral Caution  to beware how much he listens to the tempting Calls of  Loves extravagance  whereof the know∣ing  Seneca  has left this Maxim  Sen Tra  of  Hippol  Quisquis in primo obstitit  Repulitque amorem tutus ac

himself  undone  Gaul'd  by the weighty  Yoke  he  could  but  would not  shun  A Story of unfortunate and melan∣choly Love  THERE liv'd  say Turkish Chronicles  at  Scutary  then  Chrysopolis  a very rich and noble  Earl  extreamly favour'd by the  Graecian Emperor  with whom he often us'd to ride abroad on Hunting and continue absent some∣times twelve or fourteen Days together  THE  Countess  an exceeding good and pious natur'd Lady being dead and leaving  one sole Daughter  of the greatest  Beauty Wit  and other  Excel∣lencies  which adorn a female  Mind  and  Person  she was us'd to mourn her Father's absence in a solitary Sorrow still forsaking Company and Plea∣sure to retire alone to sigh or read amidst the  shady Groves  and  pleasant Meadows  which afforded sweet Retirements not far distant from her Fa∣ther's Palace  A Father's fatal foudness  HER celebrated  Beauties  had alarm'd the Youth of  Court  and  Country  Every  Father  wish'd his  Son  this  Maids  Possessor and the  Sons  of every  Pa∣rent  mad with Passion lost their sense of other Pleasures and enchanted by her Graces flock'd in numbers to sollicite her Affection but the  aged Earl  entirely doating on his Daughters Conversation never list'ned to their largest Offers bent  if possible  to keep her  single  that he might as long as he shou'd live enjoy her Company  An unexpe∣cted Meeting  FORTUNE on a certain time  the Father being absent  led a young and amorous Gentleman to take a pensive walk along the Bank of a de∣lightfull Current near the bottom of a Wood belonging to this  Earl  and not six hundred Paces from the House whence just before his lovely Daugh∣ter had walk'd out and was by him surpriz'd while leaning pensively be∣neath the shelter of a  spacious Oak  and reading softly with a fix'd at∣tention  NEVER was Joy more unexpected and transporting than that which seiz'd the starting Youth at this surprizing Accident for he had long been one of those who languish'd for her Favour but  till now  had never gain'd the smallest Opportunity to let her know how much he lov'd her having  been among the rest  denied admission by her Father's obstinacy  A sudden Conquest of a Lady's Heart  LOVE  I think  is seldom wanting upon such occasions to inspire his Subjects with  rhetorical Assurance  so that prompted by the Dictates of pre∣vailing Passion he address'd the Lady with a  Modesty so gracefull  yet  be∣coming Resolution  that she had no sooner cast her Eyes upon his Person but a  sudden Inclination  and  as sudden Fright  together seiz'd the tender Regions of her  Virgin Bosom  VARIOUS Arguments with mutual Satisfaction pass'd away the time in  sympathetic  Pleasures and such powerfull Charms did each discover in the others Person that  from that time forward  they agreed to meet in the adjoining Grove at the same Hour every Evening not having oppor∣tunity elsewhere to do it lest the Ladies Father shou'd discover their In∣trigue and hinder them from prosecuting their resolv'd affection  I need not tell the  English Ladies  that the Rules of  Vertue  and her  Fe∣male Modesty  oblig'd the Daughter of the absent  Earl  to seem more back∣ward than her eager Lover in the amorous Settlement of their intended Meetings but where  Occasions  are so seldom found it is a needless nicety to stand too long on ling'ring Ceremonies  A kind and gentle conde∣scention  so  in short  upon assurance of her Lovers honourable meaning and indeed her Quality had plac'd her far above distrusting his Pretensions she permitted him to hope he might at last be happy in her wish'd Possession and for many Weeks met  undisco∣ver'd  in the secret Grove and tasted all those innocent Delights which  Lovers  may enjoy without the smallest  tincture  of a guilty Conversa∣tion  BUT oh    How soon decay the brightest Scenes of splendid Fortune  'Twas not long this amorous Couple held their Bliss unbroken and serene for the  Earl long since return'd  had oft observ'd his  Daughter  absent in the Evenings and wou'd frequently reflect with not a little wonder that she always chose one certain Hour to leave the House and still refus'd whatever Company propos'd attending her  A fatal Jea∣lousy  his natural  Jealousy  requir'd no  fuel  to encrease its Fire but supply'd with this burnt out in double fury so that he resolv'd to watch which way his Daughter took and make it his endeavour to discover what he doub∣ted  ACCORDINGLY  one Evening  purposely disguis'd in habit like a  Shepherd  he continued in a Meadow near his House and saw the poor unthinking Lady hasten from a private Door and cross the Fields directly to the entrance of the  Grove  just mention'd  An unfortu∣nate Mistake  LITTLE did she dream her  Father  was so near and not mistrusting him who at distance she mistook to be the Person he appear'd went bold∣ly forward to the Place appointed where she met the  Object of her Love  and sitting down upon a Bank as usual tenderly reclin'd her Head upon his Bosom and began to say a thousand soft endearing things believing they were  then  as private as  before  till in a manner stupified with eager Passion both neglected every Object but each others Person not percei∣ving the suspecting Father who had gone a little round below the brow of an impending Hill and now  stalk'd  forward undiscover'd till he came so near behind the  Lovers  busied in their Courtship that he overheard with ease each little Word which pass'd between them  A dangerous Discovery  KISSES and a thousand other amorous Actions prompted the  unfor∣tunately raptur'd  Couple to repeat with loud and solemn Protestations old assurances of  Love  and  Marriage  insomuch that the surpriz'd and angry  Earl  transported by his rage to hear his Daughter give away  her self  to one to whom he had before denied her and for certain family Disputes extreamly hated drew a  Sword  which he had privately convey'd within his Dress and running violently at the  starting Nobleman  who drew in his defence was kill'd upon the spot before the Lady almost dead with fear recover'd from the fright his Sword had put her in  A cause for sudden and tempestuous Sorrow  BUT none can surely guess the storms of Grief and Wonder which o'erwhelm'd her Breast with a tempestuous Hurricane to hear the  Shep∣herd  's dying Voice so plainly speak her Fathers Accent in short upon ap∣proach she knew him notwithstanding his disguise and while the  Lover  half distracted at the fatal Accident prepar'd to speak his wonder and her comfort ran with violence about the Fields forgetting Love and all its Consequences but this last unhappy one which she proclaim'd aloud to every Servant of her  Father  's House whereto she slew with  shrieks  and  horror  THE Servants ran and seiz'd the Nobleman who stood confounded like a speechless  Statue  looking eagerly upon the Body of the  murder'd Earl  nor aiming to defend himself from being taken  A cruel Sen∣tence to di∣vide two Lovers  News was carried to the  Emperor  of every circumstance of the unlucky Action who considering wisely all particulars gave the Gentleman a present  Pardon  but resolving to prevent them from conversing with each other ever after order'd the young Lady with two  Aunts  and all the Family to be confin'd in the  beforenam'd Tower  then call'd  Stony Island  giving strict command to all who guarded it that they shou'd never suffer her to get away nor give admission unto any Person such excepted as were authoriz'd to claim it by his  Royal Passport  A while the  Lady  mourn'd so deeply for her Father's Death and the de∣sponding  Lover  for the Action he had done that neither thought upon the hardship of their cruel separation but when fleeting Time presented to their Minds the sharpness of their Fate in that severe Decree they both for∣sook all hopes of Comfort  she in Prison  grew quite weary of and hated Life and  he at large  became abandon'd to encroaching Sorrows  melancholy silent  and a Prisoner to his Grief amidst the Tracts of  disregarded Li∣berty  A melancholy way of Life  TWELVE tedious Months were now roll'd over and the discon∣tented Lover still continued every Day to visit the remembred Scene of  former Bliss  and  present Misery  he wou'd often walk disconsolately up and down along the Bank of that delightfull River which was us'd to mur∣mur out a melancholy harmony to sooth their Minds oppress'd by fear of ill Success in their commenc'd Affection and reflecting on the various Words and Actions which had pass'd between them wou'd  now and then  let fall a mournfull Tear to think on their Misfortunes  AT last despairing ever more to see his  dear contracted Mistress  he be∣gan to wish a  period  to his Life which only serv'd to lengthen out his Mi∣sery and as he walk'd  one Day  perceiv'd a Rock wherein he had heard talk of some dark Cave so  dismally forbidding  that no Man had ever yet been found who durst attempt to enter it Disdain of danger from a wea∣riness of living urg'd him on to seek the Place with resolution to go in re∣gardless of the Consequence  A bold and hazardous at∣tempt  HE found  at last  the gloomy Entrance of the horrid Place which o∣pen'd downwards with a very steep and dangerous  slope  and never wai∣ting for a second thought went boldly in and crept along the rugged sides a narrow Channel from the neighb'ring River running thro' a Pas∣sage 'twixt the Rocks directly in the middle for about an hundred Yards he made a shift to crawl along with wond'rous difficulty down a very deep and slippery Descent but  there  perceiv'd the Water which till then had ran confin'd to proper bounds encreas'd in breadth to such a vast de∣gree that there was left no more dry Ground to stand upon  A strange ex∣ample of the Power of De∣spair  however as desiring Death he was resolv'd to tempt it and continued his advances thro' the Water sometimes scarce above his  Knees  then almost to his Neck here running ten or twenty Yards indifferently smooth then falling many Foot and roaring round his head like some  Egyptian Cataract  some∣times he fell half drown'd with the impetuous fury of the Torrent some∣times walk'd thro' the rushing Streams which almost tripp'd him from his Feet with their amazing swiftness  A strange Curiosity  STILL he crept as near as possible to some one side and held upon the edges of the  Rocks  he met with till reflecting on the strangeness of the Place he walk'd in and how much it was impossible to reascend those wat'ry Passages he had already pass'd he was resolv'd to live as long as he was able and observe by  Touch  and  Ear  what further wonders the Descent might lead him to for 'twas so void of the least  glimpse  of comfortable Light that he had then no use of  Eyes  for none cou'd pierce one Inch of the surrounding Darkness  HE came  at last  so far that he perceiv'd a sensible decrease in breadth for he cou'd stretch his Arms with ease and touch both sides but  on the contrary  the depth encreas'd exceedingly and by the Waters doubled  roaring  and beating back as from some Wall he found the  Cavity  no fur∣ther capable of giving room to a continued Progress  A wonderfull subterraneous Passage  yet considering there must be some passage of emission and little caring whither it might lead he dip'd his  Head  and  Body  under Water and with much ado shot swiftly with the Eddy thro' a very short and narrow Neck and found himself im∣mediatly inlarg'd but cover'd over with a flood of Waters which he took to be the Sea when finding Breath grow short upon him he made use of strong and artfull Strokes which he had learn'd by swiming while a Boy by these means thinking he shou'd soon be freed and gain the Surface or expire amidst the Waves both which Events he form'd a swift  Idea  of ex∣pecting  either  with a like indifference  A strange Escape  BUT he was much surpriz'd when long before he guess'd it he per∣ceiv'd his head above the Water and as soon as he could see beheld him∣self within a sort of  Well  or  Cistern  almost level with the brim He swam a while about from side to side at last observ'd a  Channel  into which the Cistern disengag'd her rising Waters there he soon got out extreamly weak'ned by his  subterraneous Journey  and the first  fair Object  he discover'd when he look'd about him was his former Mistress walking in a Garden with a very sorrowfull and pensive Countenance  The happy meeting of two real Lovers  THE unexpected shock was much alike to both the Lovers but the  Lady  frighted at the odd appearance of a dropping Man who look'd like some Inhabitant of an inferior World began at first to  shriek  and  fly  but when he faintly call'd her by her Name she knew the Voice mistook him for a  Ghost  and fainted to the Earth unable to support the weight of so surprizing a discovery  BUT to conclude the  Guards  came in upon the  Ladies shrieking  and immediately laid hold on their advent'rous Visitor but when the Emperor was told the Story he commanded both the  Lover  and his  Mistress  to be brought before him and considering the particulars of this amazing Acci∣dent immediately revers'd his former Sentence had them Married in his Royal Presence grac'd them  ever after  with peculiar Favours  The Etymolo∣gy of the  Maiden Tower  and in me∣mory thereof commanded that the Castle shou'd be call'd the  MAIDEN TOWER  which  commemorative  Name it bears at present  EXCUSE me Reader for the length of my digression 'tis a Story con∣fidently told amongst the  Turks  but  Faith  is every Man's undoubted Pro∣perty believe it or believe it not I only  quote  and not  assert  it as I heard it told me for the strange Original of their  old Castle's Etymo∣logy  The seven Towers a strong Castle  THE  Seven Towers  an ancient Castle by the  Roman Emperors  call'd  Janicula  is now a  Magazine  or sometimes  Prison  for the noblest  Crimi∣nals  it is a very spacious Building and was strong beyond a common Fort before the murdering use of  Cannons  was invented the  Sultan  con∣stantly maintains therein a numerous  Garrison  Its situation is upon the  Southeast  side of  Constantinople  The Aquae∣duct of  Valen∣tinian  Miles long  BUT while I treat of this illustrious City 'twou'd be an Error no ways pardonable shou'd I fall to mention the prodigious  Aquaduct  of  Valentinian  which for sour and thirty  English Miles  brings Water upon Channels built on Arches over spacious Valleys from the top of one  tall Mountain  to a∣nother till  nigh the City  it pours down from a  stupendious height  and fills a Cistern like a Lake of fine white Marble which contains above  two hun∣dred  stately Pillars of the same and having been repair'd by several  Tur∣kish Emperors  does by  Pipes  and  Conduits  now supply  Constantinople  with the finest Water in the Universe  AN EXPLANATION OF THE PLATE Which

William Lord Paget Baron of Beaudesert c late Ambassador Extraordinary Mediator Plenipotentiary from y  e  Court of Great Brittain to the Ottoman Port this Plate as an Acknowledgement of the Authors weighty obligations is most humbly dedicated  H Hulsbergh facit  CHAP XIX Of the  Grand Signior  's Seraglio and particularly the Apartment of his Women  The Introdu∣ction  I Told the Reader  in the Preface of my Book  by what uncommon means I was so happy as to gain admission to a  Palace  which for many Ages has been kept a secret to the searching Knowledge of our  Europaean Travellers  and shall  now  proceed to entertain him with a wonderfull but pleasant and sincere account of new Discoveries which  like the Golden Indian World  lay long unenter'd as appearing barr'd against our View with unsurmountable Impediments but gain'd at last will spread throughout our  Western Regions  such surprizing Plenty of her valuable Product as may more than recompence the patient stay of your expecting Curiosities  I love not  flattery  from any hand much less wou'd sooth my own Perfor∣mances with elevated hopes of a success beyond their Merits  Complaint against the malice of the fashionable Criticks  but of this the World will give me leave to be assur'd that as I write the Beau∣ties of an  earthly Paradise  and  unimagin'd  Scenes of  amorous Royalty till now  unknown not only to my  Countrymen  but every part of distant  Christen∣dom  I have at least deserv'd the thanks of an impartial Reader and may be allow'd to blame the  undistinguishing Illnature  of such  steely Criticks  as in∣stead of owning an agreeable surprize in meeting Subjects  new  and  enter∣taining  strive ungenerously to condemn a Labour meerly out of ignorance or  incredulity  because they find it something odd and full of Novelty  HOWEVER all that base  Ingratitude  which meanly may endea∣vour to obscure the Worth of what I write shall never boast that  private fear  of barking Malice cou'd prevent my Pen from boldly aiming at a  pub∣lick Satisfaction  What the Rea∣der may ex∣pect in this Chapter  I will not therefore only entertain the World with an  agreable Amusement  but proceed by regular degrees to give the Reader an entire  Idea  of the fam'd  Seraglio  of the  Turkish Sultan  not omitting any odd and pleasant Observation but neglecting  purposely  the trifling repetitions of those things  preceding Authors  were enabled to inform you of and chiefly bending my design'd description to those glittering Piles of stately Buil∣dings  Groves of Pine  and  Bowers of Cypress Paths of Love  and  Labyrinths of Pleasure  which combine their Graces to adorn the Seat of  one Great Lord  and render perfect the delightfull Mansions where the amorous  Sul∣tan  toys away his Minutes in the wanton Raptures of his  Ladies Con∣versation  The lovely situation of the  Grand Signiors  's  Se∣raglio  FIRST  then  if ever  Heaven  decreed a part of this divided World shou'd shine conspicuously above the rest and seem to beckon  Ʋniversal Monarchy  to fix its Throne on her delicious Surface 'tis the very Ground whereon now flourishes the glorious  Palace  of the proud  Mahometan  for from that eminence of Ground on which the  Temple Sancta Sophia  has its Situation runs a narrow neck of Land descending  gradually  and on either side politely sloping downward till it forms at last a charming Angle on the  NorthEast  Point of  Constantinople  The Form thereof  THE Form of the  Seraglio  which is built hereon appears a sort of  long triangle  one whole side whereof is bounded by the neighb'ring Buil∣dings of the City both the other shelving downwards to  the Sea  which washes 'em and with their utmost Angle pointing out  amidst the Waves  directly opposite to the surprizing heighth and rough appearances of cer∣tain wild and distant  Asian Promontories Thrace  with all the Beauties of her  Europaean Landskips  forms a  prospect  full of Pleasures on the other side not one small  Ship  can anchor in the  Haven  but must pass the Point of the  Seraglio  first whose noble Situation leads the  Eye  to gaze  astonish'd  at such strange variety that all the ravish'd Sweets of  Art  and  Nature  here seem join'd as if they had agreed to mix their richest Excellencies and com∣pleat a modern  rival Paradise  to that of  Eden  Its strength and Circuit  IT is above  three English Miles  in measur'd Circuit quite surrounded by a  lofty Wall  defended strongly by a sort of  Quey  of five yards breadth which runs all round it where are planted numerous Pieces of prodigious  Cannon  of an  unexampled size  and  monstrous bore  One very deep and spaci∣ous  Ditch  encompasses the Wall which is moreover strengthen'd by capa∣cious  Ramparts  and a square  WatchTower  at every hundred or two hun∣dred Paces end in these stand  Day and Night  selected numbers of the finest Soldiers in the  Sultan  's  Guard  who see that none presume to venture near the Walls of his  forbidden Palace    The beauty of its Prospect at a distance  all the inside is adorn'd with  Spires  and stately  Balls  gilt round with  Gold  and shining  from afar  with a ma∣jestic Lustre which sublime appearance gently  soften'd  by the mix'd disco∣very of extended  Groves  of lofty  Cypress Trees  there planted in a sweet and natural Irregularity and somewhat shadowing in many Places the reful∣gent brightness of the  Spires  and  Cupola  's afford a Prospect to the distant view so full of Beauty and unknown variety that Words want Power to celebrate the Object therefore see the  Cut annex'd  for further Satis∣faction  BUT having given this short description of the  Form Extent  and  Outward Beauties  of the  Sultan's Palace  I will  now  proceed to lead my Rea∣der with a gradual Curiosity through every  inmost  Part of its discover'd Glories yet as the unnumber'd differences which alternately occur to claim our observation may confound the Prospect if I represent them jointly 'twill be much the safest way to separate the Building into five De∣grees and treat distinctly of them all that so we may preserve an usefull  regularity  The first great Court  FIRST  then  I will describe the  Outward Court  and all the  Offices  and  Orders  of the  Buildings  which surround and form it into which all  Travel∣lers  who please have free access and uncontroul'd admission  The second Court  SECONDLY I will proceed to do the like by a  more spacious Square  within the former and compos'd of far more  rich  and  lofty Architecture  in∣to which as to the first  all Strangers  are admitted  The third where all  Am∣bassadors  re∣ceive their Au∣dience  THIRDLY I intend to open to your View another Court within them both and far superior in its Order and Magnificence for in the rich  Apartments  which surround this Square the haughty  Sultans  give their Audiences to every  Minister of Foreign Nations  at their first arrival in the  Turkish Court  The Royal Lodgings  NEXT I lose sight of former Writers and visit with a Wonder equal to the Object the prodigious Statelyness and tow'ring Splendor of the  ROYAL LODGINGS  so surprizingly transporting me with endless Scenes of  artfull Pleasure Pride  and  Grandeur  that for want of  Models  to express  their form by which is quite unknown nay even  undreamt of  in the  Chri∣stian World  I have been forc'd to draw in the course of this Chapter another  Plan  of the amazing inside of that stupendious  Fabrick  which will give the Eye a true  Idea  of its wonderfull Contrivances  The Discove∣ry of the Wo∣mens Lod∣gings thought by most to be impossible  BUT now appears a  SECRET  worth the hearing the Discovery where∣of I often since 'twas made stood by and heard the greatest  Travellers  of several Nations join in one old  fashionable Story  and affirm to be no less than a downright  Impossibility  Yet I will not only trace the  Sultan  to his amorous Pastimes with the  Virgins  of his  Pleasure  but admit the Reader to the close Apartments of the fair  SERAGLIO LADIES  nay and into the retir'd Magnificence of their  Bedchambers  but shew him all the various Scenes of Love and Courtship which are practis'd daily by  their Lord  and  them  even to the Consummation of their utmost Wishes and if the  British Ladies  are desirous of a further Information still advance a step or two beyond it  AS I told you  in my Preface  that the absence of the  Sultan  and his  train of Ladies  then attending him at  Adrianople  gave a liberty beyond the Wishes of our  keenest Curiosity  as a Compliment bestow'd for Reasons there explain'd  A double Cu∣riosity  so I was willing to improve the opportunity as for as possible and while I pleas'd my  Eyes  with the delightfull Prospect of  engaging Novel∣ties  I satisfied my  Ear  with list'ning eagerly to the accounts our  Guides  thought fit to give us of the proper use of every Place and entertaining Stories of the  Sultan  's  Customs  Description of the great Gate of the  Seraglio  FIRST then The Great  Seraglio  opens to the  Sea  on either side with several low and private Gates but such as never are made use of but when the  Emperor himself  is pleas'd to order it the only common Entrance faces the beforenam'd Temple  Sancta Sophia  and admits you through a vast and spacious  Portal of white Marble arch'd  and strengthen'd in the an∣cient way of Building round the edges of the  Arch on either side  appear cut deeply in the Stone the hollow of the Letters richly fill'd with lovely mixtures of  Gold Green Red Blue  and every  other Colour  some few  Arabian Sentences  almost defac'd by  mould'ring time  but such as  Turkish Scholars  told us signified as follows  Inscriptions on the Portal  GLORY TO THE GOD Of MAHOMET AND MAHOMET HIS PROPHET  HONOƲR POWER TRƲTH AND JƲSTICE TRAMPLING ON THE NECK OF SIN AND GRANDEƲR HERE ERECT THE SEAT OF NEVER DYING EMPIRE  A Chappel built by  Con∣stantine the Great  YOU are no sooner entred thro' this lofty Gate than you perceive a  Court  the Square whereof contains almost three hundred Yards and is surrounded by a sort of  Cloyster  which I will describe immediately A di∣stant Prospect thro' the Gate at 'tother end presents you with a  long  and  lovely Scene  of  Cypress Trees  and  Fountains  charmingly adorning all the se∣cond Court About twelve Yards upon the  left  of your  first entrance  stands the round and broken Wall of an old  Chappel  built by  Constantine  and by him dedicated to the  Virgin Mary  It has been curious for its Building and Contrivance but has yielded  now  to the voracious  Rust  of Time and Ruin whose prevailing force is well describ'd as follows by an old  Greek Poet  What does not  Time  and length of Days o'erthrow  From  Times  black current endless Mischiefs flow  By  Time  the  Forms  and  Names  of Things are chang'd  And  Nature's mighty Self  from her own Face estrang'd  The Trophies of the  Greeks  hung up with∣in it  THE unintelligible Reliques of an old Inscription speak the  Chappel Christian Workmanship  and all about its broken Walls are hung as  Trophies  of their  curs'd  Success the  Spears Swords Breastplates Shields  and other Armour of those generous  Greeks  who bravely scorning to outlive the downfall of their sinking Country chose to die the  Martyrs  of its Liberty and tho' they fell above three hundred Years ago live nobly in the Praises of succeeding Ages who behold their Spoils here hung together strange∣ly representing in a ghastly manner Men in Armour with their  Arms  and  Legs  bound cross each other which the  Turks  have done by way of  Tri∣umph  to commemorate their Fortune This may seem a barbarous Action and the base Effect of their vainglorious Principles but ancient Practices of the inhumane Custom will excuse the  Turks  when  Homer  in his  Iliads  often gives us plain Examples of the like Proceedings and  Aeneas  is by  Virgil  represented glorying in the Overthrow of dead  Mezentius  and dres∣sing up an  Oak  with his insulted  Trophies  Virg  Aen Lib  Ingentem quercum dicisis undique ramis  Constituit tumulo fulgentiaque induit arma  Mezentî  ducis exuvias tibi magne tropaeum  Bellipotens aptat roranteis sanguine cristas  Telaque trunca viri bis sex thoraca petitum  Perfossumque locis Clypeumque ex aere sinistrae  Subligat atque ensem collo suspendit eburnum  Upon a  rising spot  of neighb'ring Ground  He plac'd a  sturdy Oak  lop'd closely round  And with  refulgent Armour  deck'd it o'er  The Spoils which  King Mezentius  lately wore  To thee Great  God of War  a  Trophy  due  Worthy the  Conquest  and the  Triumph too    High o'er the rest his  waving Plume  he ty'd  Yet reaking with the  Blood  wherein 'twas  dy'd    To these were bound the  Spears  which in the Field  Had pierc'd or broken on the  Trojan's Shield    His shining  Breastplate  grac'd the  Trophies  too  Hack'd deep  and pierc'd in  twice six  places  through    On his left side his  brazen Target  hung  And from the  Neck  his  Sword  all  sheath'd in Iv'ry swung  The Quarters and Employ∣ments of the  AjamOlans  THE rowe of Buildings which  upon the left side  bounds this outward Court is  low  and  mean  containing Lodgings for some thousands of those Men call'd  AjamOlans  or a kind of People bought as Slaves from every Country where the  Turks  maintain a  Correspondence  and educated from their  Youth  or sometimes  Infancy  in all the rough and servile Practices of a laborious Discipline till being qualified with strength of  Mind  and  Body  they are order'd  severally  by the  Overseers appointment  to the various Offices of the  Seraglio  The Wood∣yard of the  Great Serag∣lio  WITHIN the Court and still descending nearer to the  Sea  upon the  Europaean side  there is a plain and spacious Square wherein are pil'd in most prodigious and unnumbred heaps the  Logs of Wood  and various kinds of  Faggots  us'd in the  Seraglio  which amount  each Year  to such vast quan∣tities that fifty thousand  Waggonloads  are constantly brought in each  Waggon  drawn and  that not easily  by two strong  Buffelo's  Pleasant Places  FROM this large  WoodYard  to the Wall which bounds the  Palace  on the  Havenside  are finely planted stately  Cypress Trees cool Groves  and  so∣litary Wildernesses  which indeed run round the  whole Seraglio  in the space between the  Buildings  and the  Wall about it  but as I design to speak par∣ticularly of the  Garden Part  I shall defer describing this Division till its proper place requires my doing it  The Hospital of the  Serag∣lio  DIRECTLY parallel to the Apartment of the latenam'd  AjamOlans  runs another higher and more gracefull  Row of Buildings  bounded on  the other side  the Court aforesaid this is the  Hospital  for the  Seraglio Sick  divided into  Chambers  and convenient  Lodging Rooms  for People indispos'd according to the Quality of such as want them  Two prime Physitians  and as many  Surgeons  are appointed by the  Sultan  to inspect the Management of the distemper'd Persons who are carefully attended by great Numbers of  White Eunuchs  two of which stand constantly to guard the En∣trance  The Lod∣gings of the  Helvagees  and their Employ∣ment  NOT far distant but  behind  the  Hospital  are built the LodgingRooms appointed for the Habitation of the  Helvagees  a sort of  Boys  who wear a Dress peculiar to their Office and are kept to carry Messages from Place to Place  within the Palace  or  upon occasion  may be sent about the  Town  to bring in any thing the Servants want for no Man who possesses no Em∣ployment in the  Great Seraglio  ever dares on pain of Death attempt an entrance The number of these Errand Boys is generally reckon'd to a∣mount to near  seven Thousand  A fine rall'd List or Green for Exercise  ABOUT two hundred Yards below the Lodgings of the  Helvagees  there lies a  Green  of spacious breadth and rail'd about to keep out such as have not by their Posts the liberty to enter  Here  the  Sultan  often comes to see the Exercises of the  Manag'd Horse  and  hurling the Geritt  be∣fore describ'd and often orders equal numbers of his  Negro Pages  to main∣tain the  Lists  against the Challenge of selected  WhiteOnes  giving frequent∣ly Rewards of valuable Price to those who conquer  Other pleasant Places  SHELVING downwards towards the  Sea  on this side also lie vast tracts of Ground containing various Scenes of Rural fragrancy tall  Groves of Cypress  sweetly intermix'd with  rising Banks declining Greens delightfull Labyrinths  and  murmuring Fountains  The Gate and number of the Men who guard the entrance of the second Court  THE second Court is enter'd through the former by a lofty Gate a∣dorn'd with  Trophies  like the ancient Chapel just now mention'd guarded constantly by fifty  Janizaries  arm'd with  Musquets  who oblige all Horse∣men  Officers or others  to alight and walk if they design to gain a farther entrance for 'tis held the Duty of the  Sultan's Subjects high and low  to put off all the Marks of Pride and Grandeur and proceed as humbly to ap∣proach his Presence as they ought to do when they address the Object of their daily  Worship  Description of the second Court of the  Seraglio  THIS Court is far more large and stately than the former near four hundred Yards the square and curiously adorn'd with everspouting Foun∣tains round whose brims fine  Cypress Trees  are neatly planted forming va∣rious  and delightfull Figures of a different Magnitude all surrounded with a lofty  Cloyster Gallery  or  Piazza  artfully supported by amazing numbers of white Marble Pillars with their  Capitals  and  Bases  of the finest sort of  po∣lish'd Marble  and  of that  consists the spacious Pavements which in several places cross the Court and lead you plea antly to different Apartments which appear at some considerable distance thro' the Columns of this no∣ble Gallery  ABOVE the Pillars of the great  Piazza  and supported by them are the Lodging Rooms of several Officers of no mean Authority in the  Sera∣glio    The Stables of the  Grand Signior's Seraglio  and on the left hand at about a hundred Paces distance from it are the private Stables which contain about  five six  or  seven and twenty Hor∣ses  for the favourite Exercises of the  Sultan's Pleasure  above these Stables are the Rooms wherein are kept the  Bridles Saddles rich Caparisons  and other Furniture for his  LedHorses  most of which are so adorn'd with  pre∣cious Stones  and  rich Embroidery  that they amount in price to a prodigious and incredible Sum of Money As for the  Great Stables  they are plac'd behind the private ones and keep vast numbers of the  swiftest  and  bestma∣nag'd Horses  of their own and other Countries  The  Divan  or JusticeHall  DIRECTLY in a line with the  abovenam'd private Stables  but a lit∣tle nearer to the third Court's entrance stands a round and open Place they call  Divan  a sort of  Hall  or Council Chamber where the  GrandVi∣zier  and  Lord'sChiefJustices  with other  Ministers exhibit  Justice on appoin∣ted Days to all the People in a publick manner  THE Place is low and open to the view of all the People the Roof supported by large Wooden Pillars and all  leaded  over in a curious manner  Wainscot gilt  is all the Ornament the  inside  boasts of On the  Floor  is spread a Carpet where on Benches plac'd on purpose sit the Judges of occurring Causes  An excellent Policy in the Administrati∣on of the  Tur∣kish  Justice  From the  Roof  of this  Divan  there runs along on the left side a little  Gallery  which leads by certain private ways to the  Grand Signior  's Lodgings who by that means often comes and hid behind a  Velvet Curtain  overhears the Trials which are passing in the Court and if he sees unjust Proceedings frequently reverses or makes void the  Sentence  as he finds occasion punishing the  partial  or  unjust Decider  so that aw'd by doubt and never knowing when he  is  or  is not  there they are oblig'd to act with constant  Caution  and against the grain impartially determine every  LawSuit  ON every  CouncilDay  the  Turkish Janizaries  are drawn up and headed every Company by their respective  Officers  upon the Pavement underneath the Marble Gallery which I before inform'd you runs quite round the Buildings of this second Court  A piece of  Turkish  Osten∣tation  and there it is that they receive their Pay upon such Days as the  Ambassadors  of  Christian Princes  are ad∣mitted to the Audience of the  Sultan  or his  Ministers  that so they may vaingloriously appear possessors of a rolling Plenty by disbursing in the Pay∣ment of that one  Militia  for a few days Service such prodigious heaps of Money  Another Hall  BEYOND this Great  Divan  or  Hall of Justice  stands another Buil∣ding not unlike it but of far less magnitude here they seat such  Christian Ministers of State  or  Merchants  as may have occasion to apply themselves for  Justice  to the  Turkish Government  The Quarters of the  Balta∣gees  THE space dividing these two  Halls  admits you to a Gate that opens to the  left  and leads you into a fine spacious Square the Quarters of the  Baltagees  or  Hatchet Men  whose business 'tis to cleave and carry Wood  for every Part of the  Grand Signior's Seraglio  The Building boasts no Or∣nament but is divided  humbly  into many Chambers fit for the Reception of the  Slaves  for whom they are provided  THE Garden Wall prevents you from a further  Inquisition  on the left of this large second Court  The Kitchens of the  Seraglio  so let us visit the right side and we shall find the vacant space behind the Gallery politely terminated by a stately row of fine  stone Kitchens seven in number  each whereof is manag'd by  peculiar Cooks  and other Servants who are severally busied in providing Meat for  different Tables  from the  Sultan's own  to those of his superior Officers and from them to others of less Rank and meaner Quality  The Confecti∣onaries  ABOVE these  Kitchens  are an equal number of Preserving Rooms to which belong four hundred choice  Confectioners  perpetually employ'd in making  Sweetmeats  such as  Conserves Preserves Jellies Fruits  of all sorts  dried  or  candied  sometimes  liquid Syrups  in abundance and great quanti∣ties of  Marmalade  BESIDES these  Sweetmeats  'tis the business of the  Confectioners  to make  Sherbets  and  Limonades  of rich and costly Composition for the use of the  Grand Signior's self  and such of his Great Officers as will think fit to pay such Prices as from time to time are put upon these Rarities by those who make the Profits  The Perqui∣sites of the Confectioners  flowing from their  Perquisites  this way the most considerable Income of their whole Employment  BELOW the  Kitchens  and the seven  Confectionaries  which are plac'd above them at about some twelve or fourteen Paces distance nearer to the  Gardens  ending the declension  An admirable  Aquaeduct  stands the great and admirable  Aquaeduct  extending both above and underneath the Ground in very strong and stately  Arches Vaults  and  Cisterns  well supplied with  Pipes of Lead  and  brazen Cocks  of an uncommon magnitude and constantly attended by an Officer whose  Title  speaks him Master of the WaterWorks under whose command two hundred Workmen are continually in waiting  THE  Kitchens Butteries LodgingRooms  and all the various Quarters of the  Great Seraglio  are not only serv'd with Water from this noble  Aquae∣duct  for common uses  Strange and pleasant Fan∣cies  but the numerous  Fountains murmuring Currents artificial Lakes  and small  meandring Streams  which dance along with tune∣full Cadence o'er a thousand artfull  Falls  and  pebbled Precipices  cover'd over with surrounding Boughs or Grass of lovely green and length incredible are all supplied with neverfailing  Sluices  from the wonderfull Contrivances of that stupendious Structure  Description of the third Court of the  Seraglio  WE enter now the  third Division  or that Part of the  Seraglio  where the  Sultan  constantly receives the several  Ambassadors  of  Christian Princes  and you may observe that all the proud and haughty Carriage which in ancient times distinguish'd  Eastern Monarchs  reigns conspicuously  im∣prov'd  far rather than  diminish'd  in the  Turkish Emperors  who do not only with a sort of slight indifference refuse admission to a  second Audience  even so much as to take leave at their Departure but behave themselves that single time when they permit an  Interview  with such disdainfull Ar∣rogance and silent  Grandeur  that it will amaze the Reader to reflect upon their proud Deportment Alas how vainly do they swell their thoughts above  Mortality  the common fate of Death at last o'ertakes them but with this black difference that while the humble  Prince  still falls lamented they are generally made the bloody Victims to their  Subject's hatred  and de∣serv'd resentment so that falling short in their too elevated race of Power we may apply the Words of  Juvenal  to their unpitied Destiny  Juven  Sat  Ad generum Cereris sine caede vulnere pauci  Descendunt Reges sicca morte Tyranni  Few  Monarchs  die without some bloody Blow  Or visit  free from wound  the Shades below  And  Tyrants  who  on Earth  dare  Heav'n defie  Are very rarely found in  Beds of Peace  to die  How foreign  Ambassadors  enter the  Seraglio  A publick notice being given to  Ambassadors  when 'tis the  Sultan  's plea∣sure to admit them to his  Audience  they contrive to make as splendid an Appearance as their Quality allows or Honour of their Country may re∣quire them to furnish gallantly attended by their Retinue on  Horseback  they proceed in order to the  Great Seraglio  where alighting as is usual at the entrance of the second Court they are conducted to the third by cer∣tain Officers of mean Degree who  there  deliver the  Ambassador  to the  Capi∣gee Bashaw  or  Lord Comptroler  one who serves  upon occasion  for  a Master of the Ceremonies  'TIS  here  they stay by the appointment of their Guides till certain  Pages of the Wardrobe  come among them bearing each upon his Arm a sort of Vest or upper Garment roughly wove with  Silver Gold  and  yellow Silk  not neatly intermix'd of length sufficient to hang down and trail up∣on the Ground  Their way of doing Honour to Ambassa∣dors and their Retinue  THEY first address themselves to the  Ambassador  and having cover'd all his other Habit with this illcontriv'd addition next proceed as order'd to bestow a certain number on his Followers observing his direction as to their disposal thus adorn'd the Minister himself and such of his Atten∣dants as before receiv'd the Honour of a  Vest  are beckon'd to advance while those of meaner Rank are entertain'd by Men appointed for that Service under the  Piazza  or  long Gallery  by which as I before inform'd you all the second Court is gracefully surrounded  The ancient Custom of giving Chan∣ges of Rai∣ment ob∣serv'd among the  Turks  THIS  giving Vests  has been a very ancient  Eastern Ceremony  and was practis'd formerly as now it is  among the Turks  to give a Proof of the Re∣spect they bore the Person they so honour'd All  Ambassadors  residing in the  Turkish Court  may judge of the Esteem the  Sultan  bears the  Prince  they represent by the receiving more or fewer than is usual of these formal Gar∣ments and it is by long continued Custom now become a sort of due for the respective Ministers of different Nations to expect at least as many as some former Precedent may possibly induce them to lay claim to  A nicety a∣bout it  and if they find the Officers of the  Seraglio  obstinately bent to give them fewer than were bestow'd upon a  Predecessor  they will oftentimes persist so strong∣ly in the claim they lay to better Usage as to turn again and leave the  Pa∣lace  still refusing to obey their Summons to an Audience of the  Sultan  till the  Turks  consent to let them have it on the terms they sue for Giving Vests among the  Ancients  may be prov'd in many Places by the indisputa∣ble Authority of  Holy Writ  particularly in the five and thirtieth Chapter of the Book of  Genesis  and the two and twentieth Verse where  Joseph  sending back his Bretheren out of  Egypt  it is said  To all of them he gave each Man Changes of Raiment But to Benjamin he gave three hundred Pieces of Silver and five Changes of Raiment  UPON a warning given that the  Sultan  is arriv'd and waits his com∣ing the  Ambassador  proceeds conducted by the  Lord Comptroller  and at∣tended by such Persons of his own Retinue as are cloath'd in the above∣nam'd Garments Upon the entrance of the Court which  much unlike the  former two  The third Court not so regular as the former  is built irregular with many different Apartments independent each on other you perceive directly opposite a  lofty round  and  open Hall  the  Roof  whereof is neatly arch'd and well supported by a double row of  Marble Pillars  The Gate guarded by Eunuchs  THE Gate of this third Court is kept by  Eunuchs  as too near the  Sul∣tan's Lodgings  to be approach'd by common Soldiers All the Ground be∣tween the  Portal  and the  Hall of Audience  is enrich'd with Carpets of the costliest Workmanship on which the Strangers walk till they arrive at a fine  Marble StairCase  which ascends to the abovenam'd  Hall  on either side whereof there issues  from the Wall  thro' various artificial Passages un∣numbred Streams of Water falling with a different sound according to the bigness of their Channels upon sloping  Shells  of polish'd  Brass  and  thence  descending to a spacious  Cistern  flagg'd and floor'd with exquisite  Mosaic Work  of various Colours which easily perceiv'd thro' the  transparency  of the included Water wonderfully pleases the observing Eye with a sur∣prizing and uncommon Scene of Beauties  Description of the Hall of Audience  THE Stairs are cover'd with the richest Silks on which the introduc'd  Ambassadors  must tread in their ascent to the extensive Floor which tho' politely pav'd with curious squares of variouscolour'd Marble is all over cover'd with a  Golden Carpet  if it may be call'd so every thread whereof is little less than the  genteelest  sort of Straws which form our  Mats  in  Britain  ABOUT the middle of this spacious Hall there plays a  Fountain  in a very odd and curious manner from the  Cieling  to the  Cistern  not unlike a  Shower of Rain  The Throne of the  Grand Signior  and opposite to the Ascent there stands the  Throne  of no great  heighth  but splendidly adorn'd with an extensive  Canopy  broad  Backpiece  and thick pleated  Bases  all of black and costly  Velvet  high  embroi∣der'd  over with a glorious mixture of both  Gold  and  Silver Wyre  in the squares whereof are sew'd  Turquoises Diamonds Pearls  and  Rubys  so con∣triv'd that they not only look  Magnificent  but form a sort of easy Figure so politely pleasing that  against the Will  it captivates attention  UPON this  Throne  sits crosslegg'd the disdainfull  Sultan  looking round him with a sort of haughty Frown to view the base and servile Postures of the Slaves about him  How he is at∣tended on it  AND  first  the  Grand Vizier  stands humbly on his right Hand very near him and at more submissive distance almost opposite appear the greatest  Officers  of his  Seraglio  rang'd according to their several Dignities holding each his Hands across upon his humble Bosom not presuming once to elevate those servile Eyes which are not worthy so sublime an Ho∣nour as to gaze upon the Person of their mighty  Emperor  thus formidably Shining in his  Royal Lustre  The first ap∣proach of the  Ambassador  NO sooner the  Ambassador  appears within the Hall than there advance  two Officers  who taking hold of both his Arms attend him as he walks and still as he approaches nearer to the Person of the  Sultan  as it were by force incline his Body so much nearer to the Ground in three low Bows The  Sultan  condescends perhaps to look him in the Face and now and then bestows a gentle Nod while the  Ambassador  is seated just before him on an easy Stool all cover'd over with a rich  Brocado  The manner of his Audi∣ence  WHILE the  Credentials  are produc'd and Reading by the  Druggaman in English the Interpreter  the Presents brought and constantly expected from all Foreign Ministers upon their Audience of the  Sultan  are ex∣pos'd  to view and those of the  Embassadors  selected Train who have been first distinguish'd as before advancing with their Foreheads to the Ground have leave to kiss the  Hem  of the  Grand Signior's Vest  which hav∣ing done they silently retire and stand at some considerable space be∣hind the Stool of the  Ambassador  NO sooner has the  Sultan  heard the  Druggaman  read loudly the  Cre∣dentials  but he presents them to the  Grand Vizier  who purposely stands near him and the Audience being over the  Ambassador  takes leave but is not suffer'd once to turn his Back upon the  Sultans  Person  How he must retire  and in order to prevent it he is led out  Backwards  by the Officers who before Con∣ducted him from this time forward he must make his Application to the  Grand Vizier  and other Ministers about the Court for the  Grand Signior  tho' the Head of all their Business is himself above its Practice leaving all the Cares and Hurries of a  Throne  to his deputed Instruments of State and Power  The Cham∣bers of the Pages or I∣cholans  ALONG the left side of the Court there run Three Rows of Building Parallel to one another call'd the  Oda  's of the  Icholans  or Apartments of the  Pages  who ascending gradually from the Meanest Offices among the  Ajamolan  's are at last admitted to the lowest Chamber of the  Pages  where for full Six Years they are Inur'd to all the Practices of menial Drudgery such as  Baking Washing Linnen Brushing Cloaths  and such like Labours  IN the Second Chamber they continue commonly about Three Years employ'd in Exercises more Conducive to the Minds Improvement thence proceeding to the Third and after Two or Three Years ser∣vice there are call'd according to their several standings to the  Hazo∣da  or Apartment for the  Pages of the Presence  to supply the Vacan∣cies there made from time to time by the Preferment of the Oldest to the Greatest Places of the Empire  THERE is an  Officer  appointed over every Chamber to inspect the Management of these  Icholan  's commonly Amounting to almost a Thousand Men to him they are  Subservient  in so high a manner that no Imagination can conceive the  Strictness  under which they live  Their restraint in the  Seraglio  their Beds are Spread in order on each side of the Extended Building and themselves so rigidly deny'd a common Liberty that they are never suffer'd to converse with any other  Quarter  of the  Great Seraglio  The Baths of the  Seraglio  DIRECTLY opposite to these Apartments are Five Rows of  Baths  of different Forms and Structure as design'd for the convenience of the  High  and  Low  and every Person in the  Sultans Palace  one Row among them is the  Sultan's own  divided finely into Numerous Cham∣bers Pav'd with Marble of an Hundred Colours and Adorn'd with  Roofs  and  Walls  of  Chrystal  and a Thousand other strange contrivances to render them beyond example Pleasant and Convenient  A Barbarous Custom of the  Turkish  Empe∣rors  AMONG the Buildings of this Court there stands a low Roofed Hall of no mean length appointed for the Lodging of the  Dwarfs Dumb Deaf CrookBack'd  and other Blots of Nature many of each sort conti∣nually maintain'd for the Diversion of the  Sultan  who delights in Sport∣ing with those Wretches Miseries  The Quarters of the White  Eunuchs  THE large Apartments of the Powerfull  White Eunuchs  much in Vogue in  Eastern Countries

of the  Seraglio  plan of the Turkish sultan's seraglio at Constantinople  To the Right Hon  ble  Charlot Countess of  Warwick  this Plate is Most Humbly Dedicated  the Court on either side and reach within twelve paces of the Gar∣den Walls their form is in the shape of large  HalfMoons  embracing as it were the other Buildings with their horns or corners  The Mosque of the  Seraglio  ABOVE the Hall of Audience and between the  NorthEast  ends of the two great  HalfMoons  which form the  Eunuch's Lodgings  stands a  Mosque  whose  Spires  and  Cupola  's are richly gilded and the Pile surrounded by a lovely  Grove  of lofty  Cypress Trees  'Tis here the  Sultan  and his  Ladies  daily come to their Devotion yet unseen by any of those numerous Crowds of People who assemble in the Body of the Church in that they are divi∣ded from the  rest  by a Partition lettess'd over with an admirable Ingenuity but their Devotion is no sooner ended than they all return the way they came and pass thro' private  Galleries unseen by any  to their own Apart∣ments  Pillars brought from  Troy  DIRECTLY from the Mosque abovenam'd runs an  open Gallery  near thirty paces long and thirteen broad its Roof supported by great numbers of fine Marble Pillars six whereof the  Turks  report to have been brought from  Troy  to  Constantinople  when 'twas yet  Byzantium  they are all of different colour each from other one is  blue  another  green  and there∣fore held as sacred by the  Turks  and every one so naturally bright that they are falsly said by common Fame to be  transparent  Curious Re∣liques of An∣tiquity  THE high rais'd  Fretwork  of the Floor is wonderfully fine and stately all compos'd  Mosaicly  of great and little Marble Squares of all imaginable Colours richly representing some  Historical  and  Kingly  Figures which the superstitious  Turks  have now defac'd by picking out their Eyes and quite deforming all their Heads however the remaining beauty of this noble Gallery sufficiently demonstrates that it was the Workmanship of  Christian Architects  to grace some part of that illustrious Palace while it flourish'd gloriously in the peacefull Residence of  Graecian Emperors  Description of the  Grand Signior  's Trea∣sury  A very large and noble  Portico  or large  Piazza  terminates this  Gallery  on either side extending to an equal distance and compleatly forming a large  Semicircle  at each end whereof there open two large Doors each Door admits you to some one of four vast Chambers which contain the  Treasure  of the  Turkish Sultans  EVERY Chamber is alike for form and bigness making four  HalfMoons  or  Semicircles  two on either side at equal distance each from o∣ther with their horns or points directly contrary to those of the  Piazza  just now mention'd and betwixt one Building and another all the spaces be∣ing planted with the finest  Trees  and odoriferous  Flowers  in various artfull Figures form a sort of charming Prospect not to be imagin'd by the most capacious Apprehension  SIX Seals on either Door and three large Chains secure the Entrance never open'd but upon express Command from the  Grand Signior  to the  Hasnadar Bashaw  or  Lord High Treasurer  each Room is full of  Cupboards Coffers IronChests  and  Shelves  extreamly large all fill'd with  Riches  of a different kind and shining brightly with collected heaps of most inestimable  Wealth  and  curious Rarities  which have from time to time been freely  given bought  or  taken  from the distant Corners of the spacious Uni∣verse  The Royal Lodgings  DIRECTLY opposite to the  Piazza  which contains the Doors that open to this Treasure stand the  Royal Lodgings  which you enter by another great  Piazza  not unlike the former but with its Points so well  dispos'd and so exactly opposite that  both Piazza  's make a Space of  Circular design  and  large extent  the midst whereof contains a  Fountain  spouting from its sides large Streams of Water which Descending in a Body on the  Center  of the  Cistern  form a Figure Pleasantly un∣common  Two Ancient Obelisks  AMIDST the space between the  Horns  of the  Piazza  's stand two  Obelisks  of lofty Heighth and wonderfull contrivance but neglected by the  Turks  no Lovers of the Venerable  Reliques  of  Antiquity  are now o'ergrown with  Bushes  and Surrounding Multitudes of  Brambles  A Pavement leading to the midst of the  Piazza  brings you to the Entrance of the  Royal Lodgings  which compleat another  Semicircle  look∣ing out upon the inmost  Gardens  of the  Great Seraglio  and together with the  Gallery  adjoining to it looking like two C's affix'd together in the following manner  The Wings adjoyning to the Royal Lodgings  TWO Wings are added to the  Center  either enter'd by a Door which opens at each point of the  Piazza  and extending their  Apart∣ments  in two large  HalfMoons  directly opposite to those which form the  Treasury  but standing with their Horns the other way and pointing to the  Gardens  like the  Sultans Lodgings  ALL the space between these  Wings  and the abovenam'd  Treasury  is fill'd with Fountains  Cypress Trees  and curious Flower Gardens  Melancholy Grotto's  and the Vacancy on either side politely terminated by a  Semicircular Grotto  Built of Shells set here and there upon a rough hard substance exactly repre∣senting  Natural Rock  betwixt whose Hollows artificial Groves of fine Im∣pending Coral seem to sprout and thro' their dropping Branches  Mur∣muringly  discharge small Streams of Water gently Trickling down the Rock in many Places  The  Hazoda  or Apartment of the Pages of the Presence  THE  Right  of these two  Wings  the  Turks  distinguish by the Name of the  Hazoda  where the Forty  Pages of the Presence  have their Lodg∣ing under the Inspection of an Officer of high degree here they first begin to tast the sweets of Liberty and are permitted to converse with whom they please a Privilege for many Years before deny'd them  Apartments of the Great  Seraglio  Offi∣cers  THE  Left Wing  is divided into many fine and large Apartments where are Lodg'd the  SelictarAga  or  Royal Sword Bearer HichokadarBashaw  or  Bearer of the Cloak  and many other of the Greatest Officers of the  Seraglio  such as always have Admission to the Presence of the  Sultan  THE  Sultans Quarter  Boasts no more than Three Great Rooms but those so Splendid and  beyond Imagination  Stately and convenient that one who never saw them cannot comprehend the Twentieth Part of their Amazing Excellences  Description of the  Sultans  Glorious Chambers  THE Roofs are Arch'd and all set thick with Glittering Spires and Balls of  Chrystal  rim'd about with  Gold  and  Azure  whence in many Places hang great  Golden Globes  adorn'd with  Diamonds  of surprizing  Lustre  all the sides are Richly Flagg'd in separate  Pannels  with  White Black Grey Blue Green  and other colour'd  Marble  'twixt every one of which runs  one  of  Gold  or  Silver  reaching like the rest from top to bot∣tom all the Floor is  Veiny Marble  cover'd over with the finest and most costly  Cloath of Gold  that can be purchas'd neatly interwove with Twenty other different colours close against the Wall all round each Chamber  lie large Cushions of a  black green blue  or  crimson Velvet  embroidred in the richest manner with the finest Pearls some  long  some  round  and some of every form and magnitude in short no part of all those Cham∣bers but possesses  Ornaments  the most  accomplish'd Grandeur  of the stateliest Palaces of  Europe  cannot  equalize  A wonderfull River flowing two ways  BEHIND the Royal Lodgings at about two hundred Paces distance runs a River brought by Art from the adjoining Sea thro' subterraneous Passages to rise exactly in the middle of the highest Ground of the  Seraglio  where it forms a sort of Lake and thro' an artificial Channel runs along with mighty swiftness down the Hill on either side quite cross the Palace passing thro' the Garden Walls on either side by a large Iron Grate and so descending to the Sea two different ways from which 'tis constantly sup∣ply'd as fast as it emits the rising Waters  The impossi∣bility of ap∣proaching the Womens Quarter  IT is this River that divides the  Great Seraglio  from the Quarters of the Ladies hindring all Communication 'twixt the two Divisions by the means of its impetuous Current nor dares any Man how bold soever once presume to straggle from his Station towards the  Verge  of this for∣bidden Ground since cou'd he pass the numerous  Guards  of  Eunuchs  which impede his Progress tho' that  barr  alone is  unsurmountable  he must un∣doubtedly be seen by the  Grand Signior  or his  Officers  and present  Ruin  follow his Discovery  Lovely Gar∣dens  FROM the Buildings which contain the Lodgings of the  Sultan  and the  semicircular Wings  thereto adjoining runs a spacious and delightfull  Flowergarden  curiously adorn'd with every kind of odoriferous Plant and shady Tree which can afford a Smell or Prospect any ways  agreable  nu∣merous  Fountains  each of different form illustrate the Appearance and the  Gardens  reaching from one Wall to the other terminate their  breadth  upon the Bank of the abovenam'd River all along whose edge there runs a row of Breasthigh  Iron Rails  as on the other side appears a line of gilded Banisters  THERE runs a little Marble Pavement from the  Sultan's Postern  through a very stately Wooden Arch adorn'd with Trees and twining Jessamins which twist about it in the middle of the Garden not unlike the fam'd  Triumphal Arches  of the ancient  Romans  THIS Pavement is divided at about an hundred paces from the River into two distinct and  semicircular Galleries  with Banisters on either side a∣bout three Foot in heighth adorn'd with  Spires  and  Balls  of  Gold  Two Drawbridges which lead you to the Ladies Apartment  which lead to two great  Drawbridges  each guarded by a Party of  White Eunuchs  on the hither side and crossing the swift Current on each side of the be∣forenam'd  Source  of Waters at the other Foot of either Bridge there waits a constant Guard of  Black  or  Negro Eunuchs  and two other  Galleries  ex∣actly correspondent to the former lead two ways to such another Pave∣ment running also thro' an  Arch  adorn'd and built exactly like the other  Of the Apartments of the Women  AND now we are arriv'd upon a Ground where any  Man  except the  Sultan  is like  Juvenal  's  Rara avis in terris  even as great a rarity as  his black Swan  or any other Wonder nothing here is seen but  Beauty  strangely in∣termix'd with rough  Deformity  each small  Avenue  leading to the  Women  who inhabit this Division  Black or Ne∣gro Eunuchs  being watch'd continually by  Crowds  of  Blacka∣mores  not only rob'd of all the strong and  virile  Marks of  lusty Manhood  by a smooth  Castration  or  Decision rather  but elected from the most de∣form'd  and evil countenanc'd of that untempting  Race  as if the curs'd in∣satiate  Jealousy  of the  lascivious Sultans  cou'd not think the incapacitating them from amorous Practices with their distrusted Women were sufficient to secure them but they must inhumanely contrive a way to keep the Ladies Inclinations  Chast  by the prevailing Virtue of a strong  Antipa∣thy  Moral Re∣flections  HOW wide alas does this luxurious  Prince  mistake the real road to  Greatness  who instead of awing his audacious Subjects by a warlike Dispo∣sition and the even Balance of impartial Justice leaves his Empire to sub∣servient Managements and meanly gives himself entirely over to the con∣stant Practice of  voluptuous  Living neither knowing nor desiring other  Grandeur  than the plenary indulgment of his carnal Appetite not consi∣dering that as  Seneca  says in his  Tragedy  of  Thyestes  Sen  Tra of  Thyestes  Regem non faciunt opes  Non vestis  Tyriae  color  Non frontis nota Regiae  Non auro nitidae trabes  Rex est qui posuit metus  Et diri mala pectoris  Quem non ambitio impotens  Et nunquam stabilis favor  Vulgi praecipitis movet  THE  transient Honours  which frail  Riches  bring  Are not those  Royal Proofs  that mark a  King  Not  Tyrian Purple  o'er his Garments spread  Nor  regal Diadems  around his Head  Not gracefull  Robes  which shine in every fold  With a polite  embroidery  of  Gold    He only is a  King  who not opprest  By those black  Fears  and  Ills  which storm his Breast  Bravely stands firm his  Justice  to maintain  And hears  Ambition  tempt his Pow'r in vain  Who stands th' establish'd Pillar of his State  Always alike still Good and ever Great  Moral Re∣flections  CONTENT will make the meanest  Object  of uncover'd  Poverty  a happier Man than commonly the  Sultan  is in all these elevated  Scenes  of Pomp and Glory The tow'ring heighth whereon he stands does seldom fail to make him  giddy  then he falls below the bliss of those who can in Rags reflect on  Grandeur  in the following Notions of that admi∣rable  Author  Rex est qui metuit nihil  Rex est quique cupit nihil  Hoc Regnum sibi quisque dat  That Man's a  Monarch  who can fear no fate  So's he who never covets to be Great  And that which makes such sort of  Kingdoms  best  Is that  all Men  at will may be thereof possest  Moral Re∣flections  NO Man who seriously reflects upon the bloody ends which common∣ly attend the  Turkish Emperors  and overtake their Pride amidst the  Sun∣shine  they are fondly basking in wou'd wish to change degrees with their  uncertain Majesty  and surely Death must fall with double weight on such  as Power and Haughtiness of Soul have lifted up beyond the apprehension of its ever reaching them for to make use again of  Seneca  's Expres∣sions  Illi mors gravis incubat  Qui notus nimis omnibus  Ignotus moritur sibi  Death on that Man must heavy fall  Who  by his Grandeur  shown  Known  and  respected  too by  all  Dies  to himself unknown  A winding Gallery  BUT to return again to what I was about the Pavement on the other side the  second Arch  admits you to the entrance of a stately Gallery perhaps the finest that was ever heard of for it reaches from one Garden Wall to the other  winding  in and out exactly as we paint a folding Serpent all the turnings at an equal distance from each other and so often made that those who walk upon it lose the sight of one another every ten or fourteen Paces  Fine Marble Pillars  TIS supported nobly by two rows of Pillars of a red and white large veiny Marble all the  Bases  and the  Capitals  are  black  and the inverting Floor on which they stand consists of spacious Marble Squares politely in∣termix'd one half of  red  the other of a lovely  greenish Colour  YOU ascend the top of the abovenam'd Gallery by a broad Marble Staircase with three stately  Landingplaces  rail'd on either side with  Iron gilt  and headed with large  Balls  and Spires of  Gold  A golden Floor  You enter with a strange surprize to see the bottom floor'd to all appearance with thick Plates of  burnish'd Gold  which is indeed no more than  Copper gilt  but every Year or two renew'd or polish'd so that it reflects a dazling Lustre and amazing Majesty On either side is built a kind of Wall breast high whose inside  like the Floor  is plated over with the  Copper gilt  and all along upon its  top  on either side at five Foot distance from each other stand vast numbers of fine golden  Pyramids  each  Pyramid  adorn'd upon its utmost Point with one large  Globe of Gold  by four whereof the bottom is sup∣ported  THE Reader  I presume  will be inclin'd to think this Place as I have now describ'd it so magnificent and beautifull that it can scarce admit of an additional extravagance he will be consequently much surpriz'd  A lovely walking Place  when I inform him that on either side within the Wall are very deep and artifi∣cial  hollows  fill'd with  Soil  of a  productive  nature where are planted  Woodbines  commonly call'd  Honysuckles Jessamins low Flowers  and  Tuberoses  which supported by a stronger and more spreading kind of lasting  Greens  so sweetly intermix with one another meeting at the top and growing thick upon a frame of rich gilt  Box Wood  that you walk as in a dream thro' all the odoriferous extasies of  Natures Blessings  The Lodgings of the  Negro Eunuchs  THE  Gallery  is terminated on the left by a large Door which opens sideways into the Apartment of the  Negro Eunuchs  or  BlackGuard  of the se∣cluded Ladies which extends it self strait forward towards the  Point  of the  Seraglio  about two hundred Yards in  length  and  breadth propor∣tionable  it consists of only one large Hall supported by large Vaults where∣in are all the  Cellars Landries  and Conveniencies requir'd for the service of the Ladies  THE Room is equally divided into spaces for the  Eunuch's LodgingPlaces  and its high Arch'd Roof supported by an Hundred Marble Pillars Fifty on a side about the Middle opens a low Wooden Door and lets you out upon a Gallery which fronts the Gardens here they  Eat Drink  and Divert themselves when out of Waiting casting still an Eye of Ob∣servation on the Womens Actions  The Lodgings of the  Sultan's  Mistresses  DIRECTLY opposite and enter'd in the same manner lie the Lodgings of the  Sultans Mistresses  consisting also of one Room and Gal∣lery with Offices below it the Length Breadth Heighth and whole Proportion just the same with the Apartment of the  Eunuchs  The Furniture of their A∣partment  BUT as for all the Ornamental part the Roof Sides Floor and Pil∣lars of the  Ladies Chamber  are exactly like the  Sultans own Division  or if any difference appears it is because the Womens Quarter Shines more Brightly if it's possible with  Gold  and  Chrystal  and whereas the Rooms of the  Grand Signior  as you read before are Pannel'd from the  Cieling  to the  Floor  with Gold and Silver every Yard or two between the Marble  here  instead thereof they sert the finest  LookingGlass  which so surpriz∣ingly adorns the place that viewing as you walk along a strange confus'd irregularity of prospect in promiscuous mixtures of the various colour'd Marble Flags the Cushions Carpets and the Numerous Pillars which support the Building you are agreable amaz'd at so uncommon an ap∣pearance  Their Beds and way of Sleeping  THEIR  Beds  are only  Quilts  or  Carpets  five times doubled over which is laid a  Sattin Coverlet  which being turn'd aside they enter in their  Shifts  and  Mustin Drawers  and contentedly repose themselves till Break of Day beyond which hour they seldom are permitted to in∣dulge themselves in slumber  How their Beds are Plac'd  FOUR Rows of  Beds  there are from one end of the Chamber to the other and the Number of the Ladies sometimes more and some∣times less may commonly be reckon'd at about  Five Hundred  Two Rows of Beds are Plac'd against the Wall on either side and  two  be∣tween the  Columns  which support the Chamber  The Gover∣nante's of the  Seraglio  how chosen  BETWEEN each  Fourth  and  Fifth  of all the Beds their lies a kind of  Matron  if it may be proper so to call an  Aged Virgin  for they are always chosen out of those more Antiquated Ladies whose hard luck has bur∣then'd them with the  Ʋnsummon'd  Load of  Stale Virginity  and consequent∣ly made them fit for a Succession to the Vacancies of such a Post as by requiring a Malicious care to hinder  Wantonesses  they are Past the Tast of speaks 'em enviously and extreamly Qualified for its Possession  How the La∣dies live in the  Seraglio  IT is the proper Business of these Illnatur'd  Governante's  to inspect the Actions and Behaviour of the Young  Recluses  by day to keep 'em Strictly to their Work which for the most Part is  Embroidery  in various colours intermix'd with Gold and Silver upon  Silk  or  Muslin  at other times to see they miss not those Genteeler parts of Education such as  Sing∣ing Dancing  and the like according to the  Turkish Mode  all which is Taught 'em Daily by  Black Eunuchs  purposely oblig'd to Practice such Accomplishments as 'twill be Requisite to Teach the Ladies  A strictness to prevent Im∣modest Acti∣ons  THERE Burn  all Night  not far from each Beds Foot a sort of fine  Wax Tapers  and the only reason for it is that  by their Light  the  Go∣vernante  may be able to Discover all immodest or indecent Pastimes which the Wanton Inclinations of the Youthfull  Ladies  kept from the Society  or Sight of  Man  might prompt 'em to the Practice of did  Opportunity  and  Darkness  favour their  Endeavours  I cou'd give my Reader some A∣mazing Instances in that particular but since it may offend the  Mo∣desty  of my more  Chast  and  Vertuous CountryWomen  'twill be more Oblig∣ing if I spare their Blushes by  Omitting  the Relation  The Ladies Gallery  THE  Gallery  adjoyning to the  Ladies Lodgings  tho exactly correspon∣dent and alike in Form and Bigness to its  Opposite  belonging to the  Negro Eunuchs  shines beyond it in a High Degree by reason of the Rich  Em∣broider'd Cushions  Cloth of Gold and  Silken  Furniture wherewith the  Floor  and  Saffrai  are both cover'd looking out upon a Garden filling all the space between the Buildings and extending its  Avenues FlowerPlots Foun∣tains  and  Cool Grotto's  from the  Winding Gallery  to the bottom of the  Lodgings  A Stately QuicksettHedge  where it is terminated by a  QuicksettHedge  of a Surprizing Heigth and Thickness forming a  HalfMoon  the Horns whereof Embrace the  Inner Angles  of the two  Apartments  open in the Middle by a smooth and Artificial  Gap  which represents a large  Arch'd Gateway  leading to the Entrance of a  Shady Grove  the Spreading Branches of whose Various Trees meet over Head and form a Hundred  Lovely Bowers  and cool retirements which I shall  hereafter  largely Treat of  Lovely Gar∣dens  FROM the Galleries which Front the two Apartments you descend from either end by a large Marble StairCase turning from the  Quicksett Hedge  and Winding till they look towards the side Walls of the  Seraglio  These admit you to the Entrances of many Shady Paths and gracefull Ave∣nues of  Myrtle Cypress Orange Trees  and  Jessamins  which Wind delight∣fully from Place to Place  sometimes  admitting you to Subterraneous  Grotto  's all supported and adorn'd by Marble Pillars from whose sides there Issues Water that by falling down from different Heights on  Shells of Brass  of different Thickness makes a sort of gentle  Musick  sweetly full of Melancholy Harmony  Fine Greens for the Diver∣sion of the  Sul∣tans  Mistersses  SOMETIMES these Walks or rather  Labyrinths  lead you out upon fine  Greens  Round Square Oblong and of all forms imaginable Moated round by wellstock'd  FishPonds  in the Middle of these Greens there ge∣nerally stands a  Tent  each Rope whereof is Guarded by an  Eunuch  Here such Ladies as are graver than the Rest sit Cross Legg'd and observe the Pastimes of their fellow  Beauties  some of which run Wildly up and down the Field and form a kind of Sport not much unlike our  English  Country Game of  Threading the Scottish Needle  others Dance upon another part of the same  Green here  some are Walking and conversing Merrily  there  three or four are Lolling in the Shade Stretching and Rolling up and down in Wanton Postures and every now and then you may perceive some serious solitary  Virgin  Angling in the  Fishpond  and unmindfull of all Pastimes but her own sedate and innocent Diversion  Lascivious Customs of the Ladies in the  Seraglio  IT is not seldom that the  Sultan  does in Person grace their Exercises and then they all contrive with eager Emulation who shall most engage his fancy by the Artifice of her Behaviour now  Modesty  takes leave of these Licentious  Ladies  and the Warmer Arguments of loose desire incline them to the Practice of the most  Lascivious Dances Postures  and  Perfor∣mances  which serve to raise a Lustfull Fire and may excite the  Passion  of the Amorous  Sultan  to a Cooling satisfaction of his Heated Wishes in a full Possession of her happy charms who more than any other moves his Inclinations  SUCH  Gardens Groves  and fine  Plantations  of  Delicious Fruit Trees  as I have above describ'd fill all the large remaining space within the Inner  Wall of the  Seraglio  which confines the  Womens Quarter  The great Gardens of the  Seraglio  and divides the whole from those vast tracts of  Garden Ground  which quite surround the  Palace  and consist of Fruits of every kind  Herbs Cucumbers  and every in∣dividual thing which is requir'd even from the  Kitchin  to the  Dining Room  These larger Gardens are manur'd by Men of common Knowledge in Af∣fairs of  Husbandry  but those belonging to the  Ladies Quarter  are not en∣ter'd but by certain of the  Negro Eunuchs  purposely instructed in the art of  Gardening  that they may be qualified to serve in that Employ∣ment  Another Wall  ANOTHER Wall divides the  largest Gardens  from the  outward Wall  of the  Seraglio  leaving only space sufficient for the passing and repassing of those  Troops of Soldiers  who from time to time relieve the  Guards  perpe∣tually employ'd to keep the  Towers  which  as I said before  defend the  Palace  I know the natural Curiosity of my expecting  Female Readers  will in∣duce them to condemn my want of  Complaisance  if after having led them gradually thro' every corner of the  Sultan  's Palace I shou'd hurry 'em a∣way without permitting them to look a little into his  Amours  the hopes  perhaps  of which amusement was the only cause that brought 'em thi∣ther  TO this I answer That I will immediately comply with their Desires but must by way of Prologue urge 'em all to lay aside those vulgar Er∣rors and  Romantick Notions  former  Authors  or perhaps their  travelling Lo∣vers  have possess'd their Minds with  Common Fame a com∣mon Lyar  COMMON Fame is both a  Lyar  and a  Magnifier  of the falsities of all Mankind where Truth is doubtful or the Fact obscure she strait con∣trives to fill  deficiencies  with a productive train of illegitimate Assertions  A mistaken Notion of the  Grand Signi∣or  's Courtship  nor ever cou'd a Subject more entirely prove the certainty of this Opinion than the Great  Seraglio  of the  Turkish Sultan  and the ceremonious Practices of his uncommon ways of Courtship such as  walking thro' them with a Knott of Handkerchiefs fasten'd to his Girdle one of which he drops at every Ladies Foot he has a mind to make his Bedfellow  yet this erroneous Story had the for∣tune to obtain so good a Credit that the Learned and Judicious Sir  Paul Ricaut  has not blush'd to tell us in his  Maxims of the Turkish Polity  that such as is above describ'd was universally allow'd to be the  Pattern of the Sultan  's  Courtship  Love Affairs shou'd be kept secret  AFFAIRS of Love  the Ladies tell me  shou'd be kept as secret as Af∣fairs of State and certainly  if so  'tis doubly criminal when we betray the close Amours of  Royal Monarchs  yet  for once  I'll venture to transgress those rules of Privacy and give as punctual an Account as I am able of the  Scenes of Love  occasionally practis'd 'twixt the  Sultan  and his  Mistresses  If any of my  Countrywomen  shou'd be so delighted with the Pleasures I de∣scribe as to abandon  England  for the  Turks Seraglio  the Nation will for∣give me for the loss they suffer by considering the Accident as such a won∣derful surprize that not the sharpest  Mortal guess  cou'd ever have expected it  The notice given by the Sultan when he intends a Visit to his Ladies  FIRST then the  Sultan  almost daily visits the Apartment of his La∣dies and gives notice half an hour or more before he comes by looking out from his  back Windows  to the  Drawbridge  guarded by the  Negro Eunuchs  and informing them of his intention by the Words  Helvett Gelerrum  that is  Make ready I am coming  How he is receiv'd and what he does among them  THIS notice is enough and all the  inner Palace  rings immediately with the repeated sounds of this  Alarum  all the  Ladies  dress themselves with hast Wash Shift Perfume and Polish their Appearances for the Re∣ception of their  Master  who upon his Entrance is saluted by the whole As∣sembly on their  Knees  he sits drinks  Coffee Tea  and toys away an hour or two in  kissing  and  embracing  them with equal familiarity and then con∣ducts them to the  Greens  or  Bowers  within the  Gardens  where he takes de∣light to see their Emulation in the several Arts of pleasing which I just now told you they employ their time in  How the Sul∣tan chuses a Mistress  THIS is however but the method of his publick Conversation with the numbers of his Ladies amongst whom the Charms of  one  will often shine superior to the  others Her  on some such Day of publick Sport ap∣pointed purposely he beckons from the rest and leads her to some  Bower  to talk a while in private and prepare her Expectation for the Honour he allots her to  How he Courts her  THE  Eunuchs  who attend acquainted with the Reasons of their  Em∣peror  's withdrawing summon the repining Remnant of the disappointed  Virgins  back to their Apartment while the  newelected  Mistress of the  Sul∣tan  's  Love  receives perhaps the sweet advances of a  Kiss or two  in token of the value she has heard her Lord declare he bears her after which she is deliver'd by the Hand of the  Grand Signior  to the charge of those  Black Eu∣nuchs  then in Waiting  The Respect the other La∣dies are oblig'd to show her  BY them she is saluted with a low Respect becoming the Address of such as compliment the Partner of the  Sultan  's Bed and quite surrounded by her black Retinue walks in State along the Chamber she so lately was confin'd to all the other Ladies as she passes by rise up and falling on their  Knees  to kiss her  Vest  congratulate the Blessing she must soon be∣come Possessor of  Their Pride upon advance∣ment  TRANSPORTED by Success beyond her self and giddy by the height of her Advancement to such Fortune Reason which  before  perhaps had little place within her Mind  now  quite forsakes the elevated Creature who forgetting that her happiness depends upon the humour of a fickle Mo∣narch and must  stand  or  fall  as he is  pleas'd  or  displeas'd  with her first Embra∣ces looks about her with a scornful Air of  Pride  and  Grandeur  and believes herself as much above them in her Merit as she  then  appears by the respect they pay her hence spring a thousand Jealousies malicious Wishes En∣vies and Uneasinesses which are the neverfailing Consequences of Dome∣stic Preference among the Ladies and undoubtedly gave cause to that old  Graecian Poet  who by the way 'tis ten to one was Married to cry out  The Envy of the Women make Mens Houses downright Bedlams  Preparatory Ceremonies  THE Publick Wardrobe of the Ladies Lodgings is oblig'd to furnish rich variety of  Cloths  and  Jewels  upon such occasions and with these she is conducted by the grave  Matrona  's I before discours'd of to the  Bagnio  's of the  Sultan  where she is not only strip'd and wash'd from Head to Foot but  scented  with Perfumes to add new Charms to those of Nature that she may appear at Night deserving that Affection which her Royal Lover has vouchsaf'd to crown her with  A pleasant Custom  BESIDES the Preparation of the  Bagnio  previous to her Bedding the  Grand Signior  she is offer'd  Wine  to drink without controul that so she may possess  at Night  an artificial Vigour more engaging than the modest Bashfullness of her untried and native Innocence  THUS may the  Reader  see how wantonly the  Monarchs  of the  Turkish Empire  study means to swell their Pleasures to the utmost pitch of  Tast  and  Luxury  whereby they madly hasten on their Ends forgetfull of that  true  but much unheeded  Graecian Maxim  An admirable  Graecian  Ma∣xim  Three things there are that shorten  Mortal  's Breath  And hurry us  compendiously  to Death  Bathing  and  drinking Wine  to great  Excess  And love of  Female Joys  to lustful Wantonness  How the Lady is conducted to the  Sultan  's Chamber  WHEN Night is come and the  Grand Signior  full of Expectation laid in Bed the  Eunuchs  of his Chamber notifie his Pleasure to the  Waiting  Lady who is thereupon immediately attended by the  other Virgins Ma∣trons  and  Black Eunuchs  to the  Sultan  's Chamber all the Instruments of  Turkish Musick  sounding round her and a hundred large  Wax Tapers  light∣ing her along they leave her at the Door and wishing her a Satisfaction equal to her Honour separate and all return to their respective Places  How receiv'd there  MEAN while the trembling  Virgin  knocks and is admitted by the  Kisler Aga  or  Great Master of the Negro Eunuchs  who attends her coming to instruct her in some necessary Duties she must offer at Performing after which he modestly withdraws and leaves her in the Chamber  Her first Ad∣dress to the  Grand Signior  THE  Sultan  all this while expects her in the Bed to which she is di∣rected by two large white Tapers burning in the Room I shou'd have told you that she enters only cover'd with a  Wrapping Nightgown  and advancing to the Feet of the  Grand Signior  's  Bed  falls down upon her Knees and in an humble manner asks this Question  A Slave to your Commands  Great Monarch  waits your beckon may or may she not be now admitted  YOU may be sure the  Sultan  answers  Yes  and if impatient to possess her Beauties takes her in as soon and kindly as your self  young Reader  wou'd your Mistress  Their pleasant method of creeping in at the Bedsfeet  But alas poor Women common Custom  generally  forces them to a more humble Entrance for in token of Submission  dropping off their Nightgown  they must gently raise the  Bed Cloaths  at the Feet and so creep gradually up to those Embraces which an  Englishman  wou'd be so civil to believe deserving of a kinder Welcome and an  Englishwoman  if I know them rightly think too worthy to bestow in such a  mortifying  and submissive manner  Their Saluta∣tion in the Morning  'TIS possible however that an  aftergame  of Love and Kindness may make full amends for the indifference of her first Reception that we will not doubt of but proceed to tell you that when  Morning  breaks they are a∣waken'd by the sound of  Musick  and the shriller Voices of some tunefull  Eunuchs  singing certain Songs compos'd on purpose not unlike the  Epitha∣lamiums  of the Ancient all these Songs are handed up and down the City when the Story of some new Intrigue inclines the People to converse upon that Subject I had several presented me and one among the rest I have  Translated  to divert the Reader  A  Turkish  Epi∣thalamium  Blessings Crown the  Royal Pair  Mighty  Sultan  happy  Fair  Endless  Pleasures  bless your Bed  Angels Wings  around you spread  Godlike Offspring  grace your  Joys  Heav'nly  Daughters  lovely  Boys  All that  eithers  Wish can crave  That  let  both together  have  Long continue all your  Pleasure  Let your  Bliss  be out of measure  Blessings crown the  Royal Pair  Mighty Sultan happy Fair  The Present he makes her in the Mor∣ning  ALARM'D by the repeated Harmony of these  congratulary Songs  the  Newmade Woman  rises from the Bosom of her amorous Partner who be∣stows at parting with a gratefull Kiss some  precious Jewel  of inestimable Value as soon as she is cover'd by the Wrapper she threw off the Night before the  Sultan  pulls a  Silken String  and presently come in the  Ladies  and their  Matrons  to attend her in another Chamber while she dresses richly in the Cloaths I lately told you were demanded from the  Wardrobe  having first been bath'd and well perfum'd all over in the private  Bagnio  The Honour of a Favorite  IF she has been so happy as to please the  Sultan  in a more than common manner she continues  Queen  of his Apartment and Affection serv'd all Day upon the  Knee  by his  Superior Officers  and sharing every Night the Bed of her  Great Master  and it has been sometimes known that  One  has kept Possession of his Heart for many Years together insomuch that all the other Ladies have been slighted or forgotten while their  Monarch  's Thoughts were wholly bent to find new Pleasures for the Object of his Passion  How the  Sul∣tan  and she pass their time  WHEN any  Lady  is so fortunate as this the daily Custom of the  Sul∣tan  is to lead her up and down from Walk to Walk and  Bower  to  Bower  a∣bout the Garden Courting her as  amorously  and as full of softness as a  Chri∣stian Lover  wou'd a  Mistress  he address'd for  Marriage  all the while they walk the  Gardens  must be private not so much as a  Black Eunuch  is permitted to remain to overhear or see the fond  Amours  of the de∣lighted  Sultan  Other Diver∣sions  SOMETIMES they walk or sit in  Grottoes  sometimes in the coolest part of some sweet Grove where fine  Cascades  and other  Water Works  seem to join Harmony with warbling Birds about their Heads as if they strove to drown from any others Ear the whisp'ring softness of their Voices sometimes they mount a sort of winding Stairs that lead up to a little Plea∣sure House contriv'd within the Branches of an  Oak  or  Walnut Tree  and cover'd over with  Embroid'red Velvet Cushions  where they  sit stand lie  and dally wantonly unseen by any thing but  Heaven  in a mutual Tran∣sport  A strange Contrivance for a Seat of Pleasure  AMONGST the numerous Contrivances those Gardens boast one seems to have been copied from an  Indian Model  for in certain thickest parts of the close Groves is left a  Square  about four Yards in bigness at e∣very corner of this  Square  is planted a large  Tree  whose Branches growing very high and spreading far beyond the rest meet  overhead  and form a  Canopy  that shades all  underneath  from the most piercing Sunshine To the smallest of these  Trees  low Branches consequently such as any  weight  will move most easily are fastned strongly the four Corners of a doubled  Canvass  cover'd over with the richest  Velvet  which is pull'd so tight that it appears as  even  as a Table yet when any thing of reasonable Burthen  comes upon it all the Branches giving way like  Springs  it feels a very  odd  and  pleasant  kind of Motion  A charming SummerHouse  A little Wooden  StairCase  Winding round each corner Tree admits the  Sultan  and his valued  Mistress  to this  VelvetCover'd Canvas  where they sometimes roll about and rocking up and down so toy away their Hours in  Amorous Pastime  sometimes sitting Crosslegg'd Play at  Chess  or Talk away their Minutes in a Pleasing Conversation while their Ravish'd Senses are Enchanted in a manner by the Twining  HoneySuckles Jessa∣mins  and other  Odoriferous Plants  and  Flowers  which growing out of certain  Pots of Earth  Ingeniously made fast to the  TopBranches  of the Trees Hang sweetly down between the  Boughs  and form a Lovely  Scent  and  Prospect  not to be Imagin'd but by Persons present this Place so rich in Pleasure tempts the Passions of the  Toying Couple  to such Ardent Wishes that the Shady  Canopy  which covers them so well is often  Conscious  of their  Wanton Pastime  How the o∣ther Ladies are dispos'd off after Beding the  Grand Signior  BESIDES these  Inward Scenes  of the  Grand Signiors Dalliances  there stands a  Lettic'd Kiosk  or  SummerHouse  adorn'd with  Cloth of Gold  and  Velvet Cushions  whence while they are Drinking  Coffee Tea  or  Chocolate  they have an open prospect of the  Asian Mountains  all the  Haven  and the  Town  upon the other side with the  Kaickgees  or  Boat Men  Rowing up and down and the said SummerHouse being Built upon the outward Wall of the  Seraglio  all the  Gallies Ships of War  and  Trading Vessels  Foreign or  their own  must necessarily pass almost within  Pistol Shot  of their  Com∣modious Situation  THESE are the favours constantly bestow'd upon those happy Ladies who obtain a  Monarch  's Heart  in lieu  of their  Virginities  But the less suc∣cessfull Women after they have  one Night  tasted the Embraces of a Man are carried from the Chamber where they live  when Maids  and lock'd in a  Seraglio  call'd  Kadin Serai  or  Ladies Palace  here they live a Solitary Life confin'd within the Walls of an old Building Waited on by  Eunuchs  and can never hope for liberty unless they chance to prove with Child if so they are brought back to an Apartment near the  Sultans  and deliver'd in his presence ever after living there with liberty to wear a Crown of different shape and value according to her Quality which is defin'd by being First or Second Third Fourth Fifth or Twentieth  Ha∣sakee  or  Concubine  A Barbarous Policy  AS for the Sons they are deliver'd of the Barbarous Policy of their Jea∣lous Government immediately Imprisons them as soon as Born in a Dark Underground Apartment where they are Instructed in their Language and Religion all their necessaries handed down thro' Holes bor'd thro' the  Cieling  being never suffer'd even to see the Sun till on the Death of him who Reign'd the Eldest Brother is Elected from his Dungeon to the  Throne  of that  Great Empire  who of old as soon as he was Father of a Son or two himself was us'd to order all his Brothers to be Strangled in the Prison but of late they have disus'd this Black Inhumane Custom  THE NewElected  Emperor  enjoys at pleasure any of those Women who were brought to the  Seraglio  for the Pleasure of his  Predecessor  only the  Sultana's  or such Ladies as he had enjoy'd are Instantly remov'd to the  Kadin Serai  I lately spoke of all the rest remaining pure undoubted  Virgins  he possesses as he pleases  The care they use in getting Virgin  Here the Reader may take Notice that no Women are admitted into the  Seraglio  after Eight Years Old That so the  Sultan  may not be deceiv'd as to her being Innocent from even a thought of Man nor then unless their Beauties pro∣mise  by the Fineness of their Bloom to ripen by degrees to full Per∣fection  IT now and then so happens that a full grown Woman who is made the Prize of War is sent to the  Seraglio  by some Great  Bashaw  but then such a Lady must be Mistress of those Charms which seem to mark her as a Treasure only fit for the  Grand Signior  's keeping  How the  Sul∣tan  's Daugh∣ters are dis∣pos'd of  THE  Sultan's Daughters  at five six or seven Years of Age are married to  Bashaws  of high Command who in acknowledgment of the great Ho∣nour he conferrs upon them are oblig'd  each NewYearsDay  to send a Pre∣sent to their Royal Fatherinlaw of such considerable Value that it drains their Coffers faster than they find fair means to fill 'em so that by this lit∣tle Artifice the  Sultan  finds continual means to turn the Danger of a Sub∣jects Riches to his own Advantage  How the Wo∣men of the Se∣raglio plague the  Sultan  NOW will the Reader be inclin'd to think that  he  who  swims  in such a  Sea of Pleasure  cannot be invaded by the Stings of Discontent yet as a Proof that every  Mortal  must be subject to the Imperfections which attend  Mortality  a thousand little Anxietys torment and vex him and the Quarrels of his Women so distract his Temper that he often will be absent a considerable time in  Hunting  or some other Pastime on purpose to a∣void the trouble of becoming  Arbitrator  of their frequent Disputati∣ons  No State of Mortal Life entirely hap∣py  THUS can no Condition of our Life be fully happy  Celibacy  has its Inconveniencies and so has  Matrimony  we oft  change sides  like Men in  Fevers  yet can never reach the ease we aim at there are some admirable Notions hereupon in a  Greek Poem  which is already rendred  English  by so great a Hand that I will give 'em you Translated as I found 'em  Domestic  Cares  afflict the  Husband  's Bed  Or  Pains  his Head  Those who live  Single  take it for a  Curse  Or do things worse  Some  wou'd have  Children  those who have them moan  Or wish them gone  What is it then to have or have no  Wife  But  single Thraldom  or a  double Strife  TO wind up my Discourse of the  Seraglio  I will only add that in re∣spect to the  Grand Signior Mutes  are there in great esteem and such an aweful Silence always kept that they have learn'd a Language on their Fingers which is not only practis'd by the  Mutes  but all the Officers in the  Seraglio  who can readily  by Signs  express themselves as fully as they can by Speaking  Why Mutes are made the Executioners of  Turkey  Another thing the  Reader  may take notice of is that the  Mutes  are kept as  Executioners  and sent to Strangle such great Men as the  Grand Signior  Signs a Warrant for the Death of I know not why they more than others are appointed to that Duty unless it is because by be∣ing  Deaf  and  Dumb  they are not qualified to hear and pity those they Execute  CHAP XX Of the Revenues of the  Turkish Sultan  THE Reader must not here expect particular Accounts of those prodigious Sums of Money wherewith the  Emperors  of  Turkey  still find means to fill their Coffers  Private Trea∣sures how a∣mass'd in  Tur∣key  I can only tell him that besides the Publick  Treasury  I lately spoke of there is kept in the  Seraglio  private  Banks  of Money in strong leather Baggs the Sum which each contains inscrib'd upon a  Label  fast'ned to it These have been amass'd by former  Sultans  and are all distinguish'd from each other by the several Names of the collecting  Monarchs  deeply cut upon the Covers of large  Iron Chests  which hold the leather Baggs abovenam'd  To what Use reserv'd  THESE Private Treasures tho' containing mighty Sums of Money which instead of lying dead might be increas'd each Year by different Im∣provements are esteem'd so Sacred by the superstitious  Turks  that they believe it nothing less than hainous Guilt or  Sacrilege  it self to make the smallest use thereof till it may do their Country and Religion signal Ser∣vice at a time if such a time ever happen when the  Christian Nations  join against them and invade their Territories a thing I fear too much unlikely but in which the  Turks  are apprehensive of a Universal Dan∣ger  The yearly Revenue of the  Grand Signior  AS for the  Revenues  of the  Turkish Sultan  such I mean as are his fix'd Propriety and the undoubted Right of his  Imperial Dignity  they are at present reckon'd at about  eight Millions  and  three hundred thousand Pounds Sterling  yearly Income a Sum becoming the Possession of a  Prince  so ab∣solute as the  Grand Signior  The manner of Collecting it  THE manner of Collecting this prodigious Sum is by Assessing every Subject of his  Empire  at an inconsiderable Yearly Tax which he must pay as an Acknowledgment of his Dependance on and Duty to the  Sultan  and it is an admirable Method they have got of raising all this Money without any charge or trouble to the  Emperor  THE Petty Governors of every little  District  are oblig'd to gather the respective  Quota  's of the  Villagers  about them and set out with Guards suf∣ficient to defend the Money towards the next great  Town  to their dependant Residences here they must deliver it to the Possession of the  Aga  or the  Governour  of the Place demanding his Discharge for their Acquittance of a Duty so incumbent on their Offices  How carry'd to the Capi∣tal  THE  Aga's  adding to this Sum their own Collections guard 'em in like manner to the  Sangiacks  or the  Lords Provincial  they with the addi∣tion of their own deliver it to the Superior  Beylerbeys  or Great  ArchDukes  of  Turkey  and these last continue all in their Possession till demanded by the  Guards  who undertake to carry it in Waggons safely to  Constan∣tinople  THE Quarterly  Collections  never are behind hand for on pain of Ruin no Man dares refuse immediate Payment on the Day appointed so that  ten Days  after every  Quarter  the  remotest Provinces  begin to send away their Money towards the  City  I so lately nam'd In  every Province  the  Timari∣ots Zaims  and other  standing Soldiery  are summon'd to appear and form a general Muster  How guarded on the Road  whence with their  Commanders  at their  Head  they all advance and guard the Waggons to the Residence of the  Sangiack  of the adjoining Province  HE with all his Soldiers joining his additional Collections to the for∣mer there receives the Custody of all together and advances in like man∣ner till he reaches his next Neighbour who relieves him with another Par∣ty and in this settled Order they proceed still swelling their Collections till the last delivers all the  Revenues  of one Quarter to the  Lord High Trea∣surer  at  Constantinople  IT is observable that as the Provinces which lie the nearest to their great  Metropolis  must undertake the  Convoy  of far greater Sums than the  remoter Places  so the number of their  Soldiers  is proportionably greater as they are by far more populous for reasons mention'd in the Chapter treating of the  Maxims  of their  Policy  An admira∣ble Policy  NOW tho' the  Sultan's Treasure  is thus brought him by the universal Labour of his Subjects he is as I have said entirely free from any kind of Charge this Duty being fix'd upon his  Governors of Provinces  as one of those incumbent on their Places and consequently to be manag'd only by those Officers  Another way the Sultan has of raising Mo∣ney  BUT many are the means whereby the  Sultan  daily adds prodigious Sums to his Revenues such as  for Example  The obliging all the Great  Bashaws  and  Governours  of his Dominions every  NewYearsDay  to send him Presents commonly in ready Money which amounts to an incredible  Amassment  Another which he of∣ten uses  ANOTHER way he has when his Occasions press him to Collect extraordinary Sums by sending Orders to the  Lords Provincial  of his  Em∣pire  immediately to raise as much as he requires which they must do with∣out reply by Means as absolute as the Command of their  Great Master  oftentimes the  Sultan  takes occasion to demand such Sums from certain  Provinces  as 'tis impossible they can supply him with but sending in compliance with his Will as much as they can spare excuse themselves as  incapacited for a further Contribution  A barbarous Avarice  HERE the  Grand Signior  gains his end and finds a thousand fair Pre∣tences for the Execution of the  Governors  of all such  Provinces  he either sends 'em Word that they have quite Impoverish'd their Governments by tyrannous Oppression of their  People  to enrich  themselves  or that their Lives must pay the forfeit of their Disobedience having fail'd to execute his Royal Orders which obliges him to think them either  Traitors  to his  Power  or unable to discharge the  Trust  he had conferr'd upon them  EITHER of these Reasons or indeed a Weaker  often none at all  suf∣fice to ruin those whose  Riches  speak 'em fit for Execution which is done as I have said before by  Strangling  Why the  Turks  use Strangling  for it is esteem'd a Crime of an un∣pardonable nature to spill the Blood of any  Mussulman  The Treasure of such Governors is instantly declar'd Confiscated to the  Grand Signior  and accordingly deliver'd into his capacious Coffers  The  Turks  ve∣ry Covetous  THUS does Possession of a splendid Wealth endanger those who own it yet it is observable that  Turks  of every Nation are the most inclin'd to aim at growing Rich more zealously pursuing  Gain  by how much faster it rolls in upon them and this in every Age has been a Vice as  epidemic  as  un∣reasonable  The  Poor  are commonly the most contented with their For∣tune and  Juvenal  has left it as a Maxim that  Juv  Sat  Crescit amor nummi quantum ipsa pecunia crescit  Et minus hanc optat qui non habet  The love of Money  does  with Money  grow  Those wish it  least  who  least  its Comforts know  THE Customs upon Goods  Imported  and  Exported  are another means of bringing in considerable Sums of Money to the Coffers of the  Sultan  and  occasional Taxes  of an hundred kinds impos'd on  Christians  and the  Turks themselves  of which it was impossible to get a just Account amount each Year to such amazing Heaps of Wealth that the  Grand Signior  cannot tell the bottom of his Income  BUT as the violent Extortion of  Superiors  tempts the rest to imitate their Methods in a private Dealing every Man applies himself to study means of growing Rich as finding a necessity of being so if they wou'd make a Figure worth regarding  Juv  Sat  Ʋnde habeas quaerit nemo sed oportet habere  No Man will ask which way you  Wealthy  grow  Yet wou'd you gain  Respect  you must be so  THO' all the Nations of the World have ever disregarded  ragged Me∣rit  none despise it like the  Turkish People  For their  Nobility  becoming so but by the  Riches  they are Masters of the  Poor  are look'd upon with strange Contempt and their  successless Labours  slander'd with the Stain of  want of Industry  and the Curse of  Poverty  were in any Country an insup∣portable  Misfortune  tho' it had but that one Mark of Inconvenience nam'd by  Juvenal  Juv  Sat  Nil habet infelix paupertas durius in se  Quam quod ridiculos homines facit  Unhappy  Poverty  that heavy Curse  In its  oppressive  Weight has nothing worse  Than that such Men as griping  Want  endure  Appear  ridiculous  by being  Poor  PROCEED we now to view the present State of the poor  Modern Greeks  and see how much we find among them of the ancient Spirit of their  Glorious Ancestors  CHAP XXI Of the  Greeks  in their Modern State  The Learn∣ing and Pow∣er of the An∣cient  Greeks  THE spacious  Earth  affords no Scene which plainlier Represents to a Contemplative Genius the frail Foundation of all  Human Gandeur  than the present Condition of Subverted  Greece  that Ancient  Theatre  of  Power  and  Learning  and  Nursery  of the most Illustrious  Propagators  of  Wisdom  and  Morality  He who looks back on former Ages and Traces that unhappy Nation to its Meridian Splendour will be strangely struck with an uncommon Wonder at the Degenerate Principles of their Unman'd Posterity The Vicissitudes of  Fortune  will a∣maze his Thoughts when he Reflects Sedately on the Glorious State of  Power  and  Knowledge  in which they Flourish'd under the Instructive Discip∣line of their  Jonick Socratick Cyrenaick Platonick Academick Peripatetick Stoick  and  Pythagorean Philosophers  whose  Wise  and  Vertuous  Dictates in∣spir'd their Minds with an elevated Sense of  Piety  and  Honour  in the Practice of which as they exceeded and instructed most other Nations they endeavour'd to outvie each other All contending with an  Emu∣lative Zeal  for a wish'd Superiority of  Speculative Learning  till by the long continu'd Blessing of such Aspiring Inclinations they raised the Fame of their Illustrious Governments above the rest of the Submissive World and Built themselves a  Glory  whose encreasing Brightness cou'd receive no Shadow from the affected Ignorance of contending Nations  The Degene∣racy of the Moderns  BUT strangely different is the present Genius of that Metamorphos'd People who have so Widely Deviated from the Footsteps of their An∣cestors that to describe them rightly in their Modern State of  Sla∣very  we must place 'em in a Diametrical Opposition to  Honour Worth  and  Industry  Their very  Nature  seems to have been chang'd with their  Condition  as if their  Principles  had sunk with their  Nobility  Mahomet's  Massacre  whom  Ma∣homet  the Great on his Taking  Constantinople  endeavour'd to Extir∣pate by a general  Massacre  imagining Politickly that a Revolt of the Nation would be Dangerously and Unsuccessfully attempted when they should want a Head to guide the rough Resentments of an Undiscip∣lin'd Multitude  An Emperor Trodden to Death  Their last Emperour was Trodden to Death in one of the City Gates and the greatest part of his Family most Barbarously Butch∣er'd by the Inhumane  Conquerors  Those few who with their Wives and Children escap'd the Tyrants Rage retir'd to Woods and Places far remote from the  Imperial City  where in Disguises proper to con∣ceal their Quality they wander'd up and down in all the Wants and Hardships of a Miserable  Poverty  till by the Course of Time their mean Condition reduc'd the Nature of their untaught Posterity to so low an Ebb that their so lofty Extract which some remaining Members of that Family now vainly boast of serves but as an Arrow to Stab their Thoughts with the shamefull Idea of their present Miseries Nothing can more deeply Dictate the strange Degrees and Turns of Fate a Man is sub∣ject to than the Rigid Fortune of this Illustrious Family whose remain∣ing Branches scatter'd here and there and only known by the Name of  P  eologus  are so strangely fallen as to Live for the most part by a La∣borious  Practice of the most Mechanical Employments I was never more sensibly Afflicted at the Misfortunes of another than when I saw at  Con∣stantinople  in the House of Mr  Williams  an  English  Merchant now at  Aleppo  one  Constantine Paleologus  at that time a  Groom  of his Stables  His Posterity reduc'd to ex∣tream Pover∣ty  This Man demonstrated by undeniable Proofs that he was Lineally De∣scended from the Emperors of  Greece  but was most sordidly Illiterate and Inexpressibly Ignorant in any thing beyond the Dressing of his  Horses  yet he had a peculiar Majesty in his Person and somewhat uncommon distin∣guish'd his Extract from the Vulgar Dictates of his meaner Education an Awful Gravity adorn'd his  Countenance  and his silent Postures had somewhat Naturally Noble But it grieved me to see him after having readily repeated the Numerous Misfortunes of his Wandring Family and Proudly boasted of  Hereditary Nobility  Run unconcernedly by his  Horses  Side Trotting without Thought thro' the Dirty Streets with his hard∣en'd Hand upon his Master's  Stirrop  THE same Fate which attended the  BloodRoyal  involv'd the Nume∣rous Branches of the  Grecian  Nobility so that scarce a Gentleman now re∣mains who can Trace his Extract to the Third Generation All are be∣come alike Unhappy and alike contented and tho' the greatest part of the Inhabitants of  Bulgaria Romania  and several other parts of  Turkey  are still  Greeks    The Effects of Slavery  They Possess no  Land  enjoy no  Liberty  nor study any manner of  Learning  but with an unaccountable Indifference submit themselves to the Pleasure of the  Turks  paying them the greatest Part of that Miserable Maintenance their Labour gets 'em nor dare they think of shaking off the  Turkish  Yoke by a general  Insurrection  tho' the fairest Opportunity should Court 'em to endeavour it chusing rather to Live Op∣press'd by  Tyranny  than by an Active  Valour  undergo the Fatigues of a  Vigorous War  to regain the Possession of forgotten  Liberty  and the better to excuse the palpable grossness of their Ignoble Genius they have coin'd a Maxim now currant amongst 'em  A Greek Maxim  That they are Wisest who chuse to Know least where Knowledge of Things past would only encrease the Weight of pre∣sent Misery  BESIDES the  European Greeks Asia Major  and part of  Africa  is In∣habited by great Numbers of these People  Their Glut∣tony  But tho' Resident in different Countries they are all led by the same Genius to the Practice of little else but  Gluttony  and  Ebriety  which last Vice they were ever famous for spending their time in  Dancing Singing  and when they Merchandize in  Cheating  to such a Degree that  the Faith of a Greek  is now become a Jear Proverbially thrown at a Man of Dishonest Principles Some are Masters of small Vessels which carry Passengers and Goods from Port to Port in Coasting Voyages Those in  Europe  are employed by the  Turks  to Till the Ground themselves but little Skilled in Husbandry They are allowed to Plant  Vineyards  for their own use and that Labour they seldom spare re∣taining so much their Ancient Vice of immoderate Drinking that the Man is reputed a Churl who suffers his Friend to depart Sober from an Enter∣tainment they Drink in Earthen Cups replenishing them as fast as emp∣tied each Man for his Neighbour and sending 'em round without in∣termission till their Brains Intoxicated with the Fumes of the Wine they begin without Order to  Dance Kiss  and  Sing  Embracing one another with such Antick Gestures and a Noise so disagreeable that tis very sur∣prizing to a Stranger who is present at their Meetings  Mens Habit  THEY differ in their Habit according to their Professions ever imi∣tating the  Turks  as nearly as they dare which they are allow'd to do in all things but  Yellow Shooes Green Vests  or a  Turbant  of one Colour in∣stead whereof most  Greeks  use Furr'd Caps of what Form or Colour they  please Their Ancient Habits are now quite out of Date and they differ so much from them that whereas they formerly delighted much in long and spreading Hair in regard of which  Homer  often calls 'em    The long Hair'd Greeks  they now Shave all their Heads and account it ridiculous in the  Franks  not to follow their Example  Womens Ha∣bit  The Women as the  Turks  wear long Vests Mu∣slin Shifts and Drawers of Cambrick reaching to their Feet their Girdles are of twisted Silk neatly Wove and Embos'd with Gold Silver or Silver Gilt set thick with  Saphirs Em'ralds Rubies  or  Diamonds  and those whose Circumstances will not afford 'em to follow this Fashion procure Sophisticate Stones and Counterfeited Metal to imitate it as nearly as possible  Description of the  Graeci∣an  Women  THEIR Women are  for the most part  exquisitely shap'd generally of a  brown Complexion  excellently featur'd and their  Disposition  of all People the most amorous which Inclination of theirs is so well known to their Husbands that they take all imaginable care to preserve them for their own Embraces who esteem it no great Crime to receive anothers as often as  Opportunity  favours their  industrious Endeavours  Nature does so early teach 'em the advantages of  Beauty  that they use all possible means not on∣ly to preserve their  Stock  but to encrease it by the  counterfeit  addition of a  sophisticate Complexion  And so much do they esteem the Art of  Painting  that they  stain  the very  Nails  of their  Toes  and  Fingers  with a certain lively kind of  red  Soon decay'd  IT is to this  perhaps  they owe the numerous furrows of a wrinkled  Forhead  before they have attain'd the Age of  Forty Five  at which time  contemn'd by their Relations  they are employ'd in all the Business of the House and the most  menial  Offices of a  common Servant  A kissing Custom  KISSING  any but their  Husbands  is esteem'd a Crime unpardona∣ble unless between the  Resurrection  and  Ascension  of  our Saviour  at which time both Men and Women kiss promiscuously all they meet The  Man  first kissing the  Woman  on her  left Cheek  tells her in a Voice as  grave  as the occasion  God is Risen  when  she  upon his  right Cheek  yielding back the Compliment makes answer zealously  His Blessing be upon us  THEIR Houses are for the most part indifferently furnish'd not using  Featherbeds  but like the  Turks  content to sleep on  Mattresses  Their Lan∣guage diffe∣rent from the ancient  Greek  Their  Lan∣guage  is a  much corrupted Dialect  and differs so extreamly from the  ancient Greek  now only known to  Scholars  that they hardly make a shift to un∣derstand one Word in ten when  Strangers  speak it  Their four Patriarchs  NOW tho' the  Greeks  in all things but  Religion  are subservient to the Laws of  Turkey  they have yet  four Patriarchs  of their own who exercise a kind of mix'd Authority over them in  Temporal  as well as  Spiritual  Affairs They are those of  Constantinople Alexandria Jerusalem  and  Antioch  or rather  Damascus  These  four  have their several  Districts  of Government He of  Constantinople  has by much the largest Share extending his  Juris∣diction  over all the  Greeks  in the  Europaean Turkey  most part of  Asia Minor Colchis  and the  Northern Coast  of the  Black Sea  those in  Egypt  and  Arabia  are under the  Patriarch  of  Alexandria  he of  Jerusalem  has Authority over those in  Palestine  and all the Parts  adjacent  and the  Greeks  of  Asia Major  and  Armenia Minor  are subservient to the  Jurisdiction  of the  Patriarch  of  Damascus  How Elected  THE  Patriarchs  are all Elected by a  Synod  of  Bishops  under whom in most of the abovenam'd Places the  Greeks  are tolerated in a free and un∣molested Exercise of their  Religion  in  Churches  and in  Monasteries  which not∣withstanding they are not suffer'd to Rebuild when Ruin'd without vast  Presents  to the  Ministers  of  State  By which means all the Places of their publick Worship decreasing daily they become if possible each Year more ignorant than the  foregoing  This together with the tempting Opportuni∣ties of  turning Turks  made more desirable by the oppressive  Tyranny  with which their crafty Masters crush their Spirits draws  Multitudes  away to a Profession of the  Turkish Faith  chusing rather the transitory Enjoyment of a few small  Privileges  here on  Earth  than the lasting  Crown of Glory  in a pro∣mis'd  Heaven  hereafter  What Age their Women Marry at  THE Women  Marry  very Young and yet are apt to fansie if they tarry for a Husband till  twelve  or  fourteen  Years of Age Goodluck has quite forsaken them The Bargain being made between the  Parents  or  Relations  for till then  Love  and  Goodliking  must be kept at distance A Door is open'd and the  Lover  admitted to his  Mistresses Conversation  who is  generally  of too kind a Temper to put him to the trouble of a  tedious Siege  and to avoid that Incivility yields frequently upon the first Attack per∣haps because inclinable by  Nature  to profess the same Opinion with an an∣cient  Countryman  of hers who gives us this advice  Whate'er you do  do soon  for if  done late  You  rob  the  Favour  of near  half  its weight  Description of their Weddings  THE  WeddingDay  appointed certain Men are invited after the man∣ner of our  BrideMen  who are generally  Rivals  or such at least as the suspicious  Bridegroom  thinks he has more cause than ordinary to be jealous of These must  each Man  present a  Ring  which by the  Priest  is  interchangea∣bly  remov'd from the  Bride  's to the  Bridegroom  's Finger after which it is esteem'd a Crime almost of an  Incestuous  Nature for these  Bridemen  to commit  Adultery  with the Wife to whom they gave such a  Ring  by way of  Renunciation  from thence forward of all  Right  or  Pretension whatsoever  to her  Love  or  Person  An ancient Custom  THESE lead the  Bridegroom  thro' the Streets as finely Dress'd as his  Circumstances  will permit upon his Head he wears a  flow'ry Garland  which putting me in mind of  ancient  Ways of crowning  Oxen  when they lead 'em to the Altar oblig'd me to reflect upon the  horny  Fate which few  Greek Wives  fail of giving them and made me pity the dull  Victim  moving on withthe smallest apprehension of his Danger for a  Sacrifice  to  Matrimony  HE is surrounded by a Company of his  Relations  and  Acquaintance  at∣tended by a noisy number of  Boys  and  Fellows  with  Ghittars Pipes Drums Timbrels  and other  Musick  dancing antickly about the Company with grinning Faces and strange  apish  Gestures As they pass along there follow Men with Bottles and Glasses running up and down from one place to another and off'ring  Wine  to every Man to drink as they are walking thro' the Streets Thus they resolve to lose no time where  Wine  or  Mirth  invites their Application still retaining spite of all their Losses that  vivacity of Temper  in their Cups which formerly gave birth to an  Old Proverb  which describing gayety of Humour does

Priest  are  join'd  with several Prayers for the suc∣cessful Issue of their Marriage after which they change their  Garlands  and retire to their Houses where the remainder of the Day being spent in

ad∣mirably  Nature  has endued the  nimbleminded Graecian Ladies  with the finest qualifications in the World for  Cuckolding  their Husbands  A pleasant Story of a Graecian Lady  THERE is a little Village call'd  Belgrade  about fifteen Miles from  Constantinople  wonderfully pleasant for its  airy Situation  here a  Greek  who was grown rich by  Merchandizing  kept a very pretty  Country House  and in it a young Wife extreamly handsome but as somewhat brisker than he wish'd her she alarm'd his Jealousy to watch her strictly nor wou'd he often let her walk alone in the adjoining Groves and Meadows  HOWEVER I was  one Day  going by a Woodside at the bottom of a  Hill  to Angle in a  River  that ran by it and perceiv'd upon the  Bank  a charming youthful Lady busy at her Needle with a  Pot of Water  standing by her I immediately imagin'd right and guess'd her the  fine Wife  of the  rich Greek  abovenam'd I must own I was surpriz'd to find her so beyond my expectation gay and beautiful I saw she was alone and ventur'd to address her in  Italian  she return'd my Salutation in that Language and permitted me to sit down by her and converse with all the Liberties of  decent Familiarity  Her familiar Temper  SHE presently began to make Complaint of the Restriction she was under by her Husbands Jealousie and the Restraint which Women in that Country were oblig'd to undergoe and really thence proceeded to make such kind advances and so prettily encourage me to hope her fa∣vour e'er I ask'd it that I only wanted  vanity  to think I might have met success in any kind of offer  Youth  or  Inclination  might have tempted me to make her  A wonderful Presence of Mind  BUT on a sudden in the Height of her Discourse and  Gayety  we heard a Voice among the Trees upon the other side of the River Im∣mediately she knew it was  her Husband  and expecting every moment when he wou'd appear in sight was sure he must Discover me to have been talking with her so the very minute that he call'd her she fell  sideways on the Ground extended both her Arms with natural negligence let drop the  Silk  she was at Work upon and seem'd as much Asleep as if she really had been so  TWAS no hard Task to guess the meaning of this  Counterfeited Slum∣ber  so that willing to prevent all cause of Jealousy instead of striving to get out of Sight I started up and bending forward look'd upon her Face as if surpriz'd to find a  Woman  in that Place and Posture  I had hardly time to regulate my  Air of Wonder  when the  Greek  ap∣pear'd upon the Bank directly opposite he  Started  when he saw the Posture of his  Wife  and me so near her I pretended an  Amazement  equal to his own at his appearance and was just about to ask him if he knew that  Lady  when he Interrupted my design by  Hallowing  as loud as he cou'd possibly to wake his  Consort  SHE  Poor Creature  was so fast asleep that all his  Noises  were in vain she Slumbred on till I as willing to give all the Countenance Imaginable to her  Politic Contrivance  took her by the  Arm  and shook her pretty roughly  An admirable Counterfeit  at this she Rous'd and having rubb'd her Eyes with admirable Cunning look'd about her and was  doubtless  much surpriz'd to see me there it having been so long since we Discours'd together  HOWEVER I was pleas'd to see how excellently she contriv'd to humour wonder mix'd with an  alloy  of Modesty both which I fear and ten to one you'll think so by the Sequel were alike Strangers to her  Na∣ture  she started up upon her Feet and fix'd her Eyes upon me with an Artful  Wildness  running Backwards as I offer'd to approach her with a  Shriek  or two enough to Frighten all the  Tygers  in the  Wilderness  THE more to take all cause of Apprehension from the  Staring Husband  I advanc'd as she retir'd still bowing and assuring her I meant no harm desiring her to Apprehend no danger from my presence who was drawn by Accident to Walk that way and by her  Charms  detain'd to gaze upon her  Person  all this while the  Subtle Female Devil  kept a  Sidelongglance  upon her Husbands Countenance who seem'd diverted at the Fright my  Compliments  had put her in she saw him smile and was resolv'd to keep up the  Conceit  wherefore while I still continued  Bowing  and Addrest her with a Thousand  Congees  she  Inhumanely  stoop'd down and snatching up the  Earthen Pot  which stood upon the Ground threw full three  Pints of Water  in my  Face  and  Bosom  An unexpect∣ed return of Civility  A Reasonable Woman  one wou'd think  had been contented with this first Attack but she it seems was of another mind for while I stoop'd to shake the Water from my  Eyes  and  Linnen  she fell upon me  like a Lioness  Tore of my  Perriwig  and laid about her at so Merciless a Rate that I began to think the Safest way wou'd be to  Fly  where  Fighting  was esteem'd  Dishonourable  ACCORDINGLY I turn'd about in order to escape but my  she Adversary  caught me by the  Collar  on the Backpart of my  Neck  and push'd me on as fast as I well car'd to run still  Thumping  me upon the  Back  and calling  Names  as loud as possible till being got at some considerable distance from her  Husband  who was all this while half Dead with Laugh∣ing  A Pleasant way of Assig∣nation  she depress'd her Voice and in the  Softest Accents  she cou'd utter cry'd  Fail not to meet me here to Morrow  and as soon as she had spoke these Words she push'd me forward and ran back again as fast as she was  Able  THE turn of this  last  part of the  Intrigue  surpris'd me ten times more than all the rest However I ran back to fetch my Periwig while she was crossing a  small Bridge  a little higher to get over to her  Husband  who as soon as his long fit of Mirth allow'd an  Interval  cry'd out to me  Excuse her Sir the  Graecian  Wives are never us'd to Strangers Company and only love their Husbands Conversation  A mistaken Husband  As soon as he had made this Speech he fell a  laugh∣ing  more than ever and it was with much ado I cou'd forbear to follow his Example when I saw the  Fool  begin to  kiss his loving Wife  and hug her in his Arms till they got out of sight in their way  homeward  I must confess I sped so  Ill  at first that I had little cause to think my  watry Entertainment  was an  Omen  of  Success  in the Conclusion  Water  will at any time extinguish  Fires  that have but just  begun  to  blaze  and she had cool'd my  Flames  a little too soon to tempt 'em to a second kindling so that I forbore for many reasons going next Day to the aforesaid Place of  Assignation  A second Meeting  BUT 'twas about a  Fortnight  after when as I was walking up a Lane which ran along the backside of her  Husband's House  she saw and bec∣kon'd me to a small  Summer House  in which she sat at Work as formerly  GoodManners  led me to embraee the  Invitation  where the first Demand was  Why I did not come the Day appointed  I excus'd it as I cou'd and she proceeded with a number of Assurances to tell me  how concern'd she was that she had been oblig'd against her Will to use me so uncivilly  and in short pro∣ceeded to such kind Expressions that  I every moment  look'd to have another  Invitation  to the Rivers side  A surprize as bad as the former  BUT in the midst of her Discourse instead of answering my Expectati∣on by renewing her kind Summons she  on a sudden  rais'd her Voice to double heighth began to spit upon me and abuse me to a wonderful de∣gree  however  I had hardly time to be surpriz'd before I guess'd the reason of her Change by seeing her turn round and call as loud as she cou'd speak  Dear Dear come hither Dear and shoot this Stranger thro' the Head I cannot live in quiet for him  The moment after came the Husband peep∣ing over his Wives Shoulder looking after me who never staid to justi∣fie my self against the  Accusation  but made the utmost hast to get away least he shou'd take an Opportunity to do as his  Goodnatur'd Lady  had com∣manded him  I staid at  Belgrade  some Weeks longer but took care to go no more that way and by the strange Discovery I made  hereby  of Womens Temper I re∣solv'd to bear in my Memory two  Maxims  of this Country which are if I mistake not left as follows  Two  Graecian  Maxims  The first is  A  Woman  knows nothing but what she has a mind to  And the other  You that are about  Marrying  look upon your  Neighbours  The  Graecian  Funerals  THEY differ little in their  Modern  from their  Ancient Funerals  the  Pa∣rent Wife  or nearest of the  Kindred  catches the departing Breath by join∣ing Mouths with those who  die  when  dead  they wash their Bodies with the richest  Oils  and then instead of putting on a  Winding Sheet  adorn 'em in the  finest Cloaths  they wore  while living  Mercenary Mourners  THEN they lay them on an open  Bier  upon a  Quilt  or  Mattress  twisted round with  Garlands  of a hundred various kinds of Flowers and conduct 'em to the Place appointed for their  Burial  follow'd by the weep∣ing Friends of the Deceas'd who are preceeded by a certain Number of  bir'd Mourners  commonly of  Jewish Women  who by constant Practice of their  Hypocritical  Concern become such Mistresses of  Tears  and  Groanings  that by  howling  as they go along with  tearing off their Hair beating their Breasts  and lamentably weeping in a counterfeited Sorrow they extract a real Flood of  Tears  from many tenderhearted People altogether uncon∣cern'd in the occasion of their  Lamentations  so that they appear exact ob∣servers of the following Advice of that admirable  Tragedian Seneca  Sen  Tra Agam  Lacrymas Lacrymis miscere juvat  The mixing  Tears  with  Tears  affords a melancholy sort of Comfort  THEY lay the  Body  in the  Grave  without a  Coffin  cutting  first  his Cloaths to pieces with their  Penknives  lest the  Corps  shou'd be  dug up  by needy People for the sake thereof they throw great Boughs of  Cypress  on the  Grave  and hang it as we do  Atcheivements  over the Door of the Deceas'd Person's House  An ancient Custom  THE  Women  generally cut a Lock of  Hair  and tie it to the Body of their  dead Relation  why they use so odd a Custom none cou'd tell me but 'tis certain they receiv'd it from the Practice of their  Ancestors  for that 'twas us'd among the  ancient Greeks  appears in many  Writers  but particularly in the three and twentieth  Iliad  of  Homer  where he speaks as follows of  Achil∣les  celebrating the  Funeral  of  Patroclus  Hom Iliad      Standing  apart  the  Pile  where lay the Dead  He cuts the  yellow Tresses  from his Head  Tresses  he  long e'er that  to  Sperchius  vow'd  And turning to his Friend thus spoke aloud  Since I must  never  after all my Toil  Return to visit my dear  Native Soil    On lov'd  Patroclus  I these  Locks  bestow  That he may bear 'em to my  Friends below  This said His comely  Hair  he neatly spread  And laid it in the Hand of his  Companion Dead  Another an∣cient  Graecian  Custom  BESIDES their Hair they often bury in the  Graves  of their  Relations  things of rich and costly Value such as  Bracelets Rings Girdles  and the like this also is an ancient Custom for the  Greeks  of Note were burnt of old and had their  Funeral Piles  enrich'd with precious  Jewels Gums Sheep Horses Cloaths  and every thing of worth to serve their Uses in the other World The  Ceremony  may be well conceiv'd by a description you may find in  Statius  of the solemn Funeral of  Archemorus  Stat Lib    Non

 Cries  repeat  While num'rous  Flocks  and  Beasts half Slain  expire  Amidst the  rising Flames  of a  less noble Fire  BY what has now been said the Reader will perceive the  Greeks  ex∣treamly fallen from their  ancient Glory  and indeed they have not only lost their  Wisdom  but their very Industry deserving nothing less than the  En∣comium Juvenal  thought fit to give them upon that

Heav'n  he'll go  CHAP XXII Of the  Graecian  Religion  The Merit of the ancient  Grecian  Church  THE  Graecian Church  in former Ages has been famous for Convert∣ing many Nations to the Doctrine of  Christianity  but is as much decay'd at present as their  Temporal Affairs  a barbarous  Ignorance  possessing  Ʋniversally  their Notions of  Religion  WIDELY do they differ as to point of  Faith  from  Roman Principles  and tho' they often have profess'd a perfect Reconciliation to the  Tenets  of that  Church  and frequently agree'd on certain Articles of  Ʋnion  it was only at such times as being pinch'd by  Poverty  or other Inconveniencies they hop'd  Redress  from flattering the  Papal Clergy  into a Belief that they were willing to embrace the  Romish Doctrine  The Igno∣rance of the Modern  I have before inform'd you they are subject to the Power of four  Patri∣archs  those in former times were Men of  Learning  and  undoubted Piety  chosen to their Offices for their  Integrity of Life  and exemplary  Gravity in Conversation  now the highest  Briber  carries it and the declining Dignity is strangely sunk from ancient Worth to  Ignorance  and  Poverty  Two sorts of  Graecian  Priests  HOWEVER under these superior Members of the  Modern Graecian Church  are found two kind of  Priests  the  first  a sort of  Monks  despisers of the World and all its Vanities who taking leave of  Temporal Affairs  im∣mure themselves for Life within the  Walls  of certain strong and ancient  Monasteries  which are spread in Numbers over all their Country And the  second  are those common  Parish Priests  ordain'd by the abovenam'd  Patriarchs  to teach the People the Great Duties of  Religion  a  Task  for which they are but ill provided while depress'd by such a weight of  Slavery  and  Ignorance  The Monks call'd  Coloiero's  THE  First  the  Greeks  distinguish by the Name of  Coloiero's  or  Mona∣stic's  and among the many Places which contain the Brothers of their Or∣der  Mount Athos  is the Chief for on that Hill alone stand  four and twenty  spacious  Convents  constantly maintaining near  seven thousand Monks  who live retir'd by Oath oblig'd to a perpetual  Celibacy  and a  Life  entirely se∣parated from the  Layety  of their  Religion  The  Coloiero's  way of living  THEY wear a kind of long  black Gowns  and  Hoods  of a course hairy Substance letting grow their  Locks  to inconvenient length in contradicti∣on to the  Shaving Custom  of the  Roman Clergy  They live by their own La∣bours on what poor Provision they can get by  Tillage Spinning  and Im∣proving every way the  Product  of the Country round 'em They are  grave austere  and modest of Behaviour and by the Poor  unknowing Greeks  set out to Strangers with a thousand high  Encomiums  on their  Learning  and  Capacities  but fall so short of expectation  when convers'd with by a Traveller  and are so much  involv'd  in the Stupidity of their subverted Countrymen that all I learn'd by making them a Visit was the truth of an Expression of the ad∣mirable  Juvenal  who tells us  Fronti nulla fides  There is no knowing a Man's  Soul  by his Countenance And another honest  Spanish Proverb  that declares  A Spanish Proverb  No es tan bravo el Leon come le pintan  that is The Lyon is not half so fierce as they paint him  The Parish Priests de∣scrib'd  THE other  Priests  of  Greece  if possible are still more ignorant than they and scatt'red numerously up and down the Country not being very much respected by the common People nor in  Dress  or  Manners  very dif∣ferent from them 'tis a wonder if a Man considers the  oppressive Burthen  of that  Slavery  which crushes 'em how they have preserv'd the very  Faith  of  Christians  which they do not only rigidly profess but to support its Do∣ctrine still retain the following Principles  Their opposi∣tion to the Romish Church  IN opposition to the  Romish Church  which they esteem  Schismatical  and laugh at the Assertion of the  Papal  Title to the Blessing of  Infallibility  they hold that the  Holy Ghost proceeds from God the Father  only  Their Notion of the Eucha∣rist  THEY Administer the  Eucharist  in both kinds but as if the very Pra∣ctice of  Religion  shou'd submit to the  Intemperance  of a licentious People they esteem the  Wine  not any way  available  unless they drink it in consi∣derable quantities a sign  say they  that what we do we do with satisfacti∣on and a  heartiness  that proves we bear respect to the  injunction  while the  moderate sipping  of your  Western Churches  seems to speak a kind of force upon your  Inclinations  Leaven'd Bread  THEY  leaven  all the Bread they use in Administration of the  Sacra∣ment  esteeming such as is not so prepar'd unworthy the Great Use they are to put it to  Graecian  Paintings  THEY admit of  Paintings  on the  outward Walls  and  inward Orna∣ments  of all their  Churches  drawing frequently the  Virgin  which you may observe the  Eastern Nations  always represent a  Blackamoore  the Figure of  Almighty God  like an  old Man  with a  white Beard  the  Holy Ghost  and many of the twelve  Apostles  with the  later Fathers  of the  Church  as near as they can place 'em to the  Altar  The Picture of St  George  AMONGST the Paintings of the  Greeks Armenians  and some other  Eastern Christians  nothing is so common as the Representation of  St George on Horseback  fighting with a  Dragon  as in the  Pictures  on our  SignPosts  in  Great Britain  why they have this Figure in such  Vogue  among them I cou'd never meet a  Priest  of sence enough to tell me but am apt to think that  Basilius  and some other ancient Writers are of Opinion that much cele∣brated Piece is nothing but an  emblematical Design  An Emblema∣tical Repre∣sentation  St George  as painted like a well arm'd Warriour representing  a good Christian  strongly oppos'd by a  Great Dragon  that is the  Devil  who is vanquish'd by him and there∣by the  Kings Daughter  that is the  Church of Christ  preserv'd from being de∣vour'd by her dreadful Adversary and this Opinion is the more  authentic  because in every other Place but  England  we shall seldom see the  Picture  of St George  but in some ancient Church or Monastery and in either of those places seldom miss it  The Igno∣rance of Mo∣dern  Greeks  in Painting  NOW tho' they seem to value Painting they have nothing of the  Ge∣nius  of their fam'd  Apelles  left among them what they do is very flat and scarce deserves a better Name than that of daubing and it is observable that notwithstanding their respect for Pictures they abhorr all sorts of  Sculpture  with a strange antipathy refusing to admit them in their Chur∣ches or even Dwelling Houses out of a ridiculous Opinion that the very looking on such  Pieces  savours of  Idolatry  Ever burning Lamps  VAST quantities of Oyl they daily wast by burning it in Lamps in all their Churches never suffering them to extinguish as believing it a sort of Duty well receiv'd by God and shewing their respect to the Receptacle of his Divinity  Their Notions of the State of the Soul after Death  THEY all agree in the necessity of using  Extream Ʋnction  which they practice as inducted by St  James  they rigorously dissent from the Opini∣on of the  Roman Catholicks  in relation to the  Existence  of a Purgatory maintaining most of them at least  that the departed Souls of Mortal Men are sensible of neither Joy nor Torment till the Day of Judgement  The  Graecian  Holy Days  THE Year they reckon in the  Roman way  but mark above an hundred  HolyDays  to be observ'd on pain of  Excommunication  this I take to be an undeniable Example of their hatred to Activity and Inclinations to the Practice of an idle and luxurious Life forgetting Misery while drown'd in Sloth and wallowing supinely in the Down of Idleness amidst those tortu∣ring Proofs of Slavery which ought to sting a generous Mind with Sense of his Misfortunes  Their Fasts and Feasts  THEY Fast on  Wednesdays Fridays  and all  Holy Eves  but Feast on  Saturday  because  say they  it was the ancient  Sabaoth  but I rather am in∣clin'd to think because they are unwilling to omit the least pretence whereby they may indulge a craving Appetite  How far they tolerate Ma∣trimony  THE Clergy are allow'd to Marry once but  Bigamy  is look'd upon too wanton a desire to be permitted them and  Trigamy  is so abhorr'd by all the  Greeks  that it is never known among them but forbidden with the strictest Prohibition even to the Laity themselves  Their Lents  THEY keep four  Lents  within the Year so strictly that in either 'tis esteem'd a damnable Transgression and a Sin beyond excuse to eat the smallest Piece of Flesh or Fish wherein there is a drop of Blood contain'd yet one Exception may be made to this strict Rule because the  Lent  preceeding  Easter  is not held so rigid as the other wherefore all the Laity are then allow'd to eat what kind of Fish their Fancy leads 'em to or Circumstances can afford 'em  Their Litur∣gies and uni∣versal Igno∣rance and Stupidity  THEY read the Liturgy of St  Chrysostome  unless upon their Festivals and then their Priests attir'd  Pontifically  read St  Basil  's but with little Signs of Decency or Devotion and indeed so miserably are they led away by love of Idleness and long Captivity that they possess in any kind but few of those Perfections which in former times distinguish'd their Politer Countrymen retaining nothing but their  Name  their very Language be∣ing as I said before entirely lost among them and that ruin'd Nation sunk so low that from the dread and admiration of the distant World they are become at present the contempt and pity of the vilest Wretches of the whole Creation such is the uncertainty of  humane Blessings  and the cer∣tain  Frailty  of our weak Mortality  CHAP XXIII Of the  Armenians  and their Religion  What the  Ar∣menians  are  THAT  Christian Church  which calls its self  Armenian  is in Mag∣nitude far more Considerable than the  Graecian  and consists of the displac'd Inhabitants of those large Tracts of Land which bore the Name that now distinguishes her People who have Widely spread themselves in many Countries and are numerously Scatter'd up and down the Countries subject to the  Great Mogul Grand Signior  and the  King of Persia  Their patri∣archal Seat  AT  Tyberis  a large City in the Territories of the last they live in very great respect among the  Natives  and are very Wealthy by the means of Traffick Here their  Patriarch  has his Seat and here the Richest and most Noble of their People fix their Dwellings  Great Num∣bers subject to the  Turkish Sultan  BUT the occasion of my speaking of 'em here is that there are Vast Numbers like the  Greeks  remaining subject to the Government of the  Grand Signior  who possesses the Dominion of their Ancient Monarchs by the unresisted force of an Illegal Usurpation from the Right of  Conquest  Handed down from Prince to Prince for Ages long since past so that they now retain no notion of their former liberty but live dependant on the Pow'r of a Despotick Tyrant  Their Privi∣leges  IN this however they have better Fortune than their FellowSlaves the  Greeks  that they are free from that unnatural Duty of delivering their Children to be sent upon Triennial Seizures to  Constantinople  and enjoy a Hundred Privileges more  Why given them  because a certain Countryman of theirs a Flatterer of  Mahomets  and one who us'd to Prophesie his Future Great∣ness gain'd a Promise from him that he wou'd injoin his Followers if e∣ver they shou'd see occasion to Invade  Armenia  and the will of  God  shou'd give it to their Power that they wou'd distinguish the Inhabitants from other Conquer'd People by such large Immunities as shou'd allevi∣ate the Burthen of their  Losses  Their Cha∣racter  THEY are very Ignorant but very Honest Industrious in their Na∣tures Slow to Anger and extreamly willing to forgive an Injury Abste∣mious in their Diet little Drinkers and inclin'd to Melancholy and Sedate Retirements Devout and Superstitious in a High degree Patient in Af∣fliction nor too soon Buoy'd up beyond themselves by the Successful turns of Chance or their Endeavours  The Enmity between the  Greeks  and them  IN former Ages they were subject to the  Graecian Patriarch  of  Constan∣tinople  but about the time of the Eutychian Heresy Revolted from his Jurisdiction and had met with such unbecoming Usage from the Proud De¦portment of the  Greeks  in those  Old Times  that ever since they have Ab∣horr'd their Memory and now profess so rancour'd an Aversion to the Peo∣ple of that Name that if by Chance for it but rarely happens any  Greek  be∣comes a Convert to the Faith of the  Armenians  they refuse admiting him a Member of their Church till they have Rebaptiz'd him after their own Me∣thod  The number and piety of their Bishops  THERE are above three hundred Bishops of that Nation scatter'd strangely up and down with poor Allowances for the support of their De∣gree which notwithstanding is sufficiently atton'd for by the Veneration paid 'em from the common People and the humble dictates of their own Morality which teaches them contentedly to spend their  Lives  in peaceful Poverty and raise their Wishes to a  Future Prospect  far surpassing the chi∣merical Advantages accruing from the gross and earthly Blessings which attend the aim of  Prosperous Ambition  THE Tenets of their Faith are gather'd from the several Opinions of the  Eastern Churches  strangely shuffled into an obscure Collection hardly one in fifty can inform a Stranger in the Principles and Grounds of the Re∣ligion he professes But the Foundation of their  Faith  is altogether built upon the following Articles  Their Notion of one Na∣ture in Christ  THEY will allow in Christ one Nature only but yet maintain this No∣tion with a difference from  Eutyches  and the other Introducers of that Here∣sy for whereas they taught the Nature of our Saviour to be one by a com∣mixture of Divine and Human the  Armenians  hold the  Ʋnion  of those Natures to be made by an entire Conjunction as the  Soul  of Man is join'd to his  corporeal Substance  Some other Tenets  THEY Administer the  Sacrament  in both kinds but ardently deny all notion of the real Presence in it They hold a Purgatory but reject all praying for the Dead they disallow of the Supremacy of the  Roman Church  and joyn with that of  Greece  in their Assertion that the  Holy Ghost  pro∣ceeds but from the Father only and that the  Souls  of the Departed Good or Bad must never feel the smallest share of  Joy  or  Torment  till the dread∣ful Day of Universal  Judgment  The abstemi∣ousness of their Priests  THEIR Clergy like the  Greeks  are once and only once allow'd to Marry and so very rigid and austerely Exemplary are their Lives that they abstain from Flesh of any kind nor can by any means be brought to  eat it  oftner than five times a Year nor wou'd they then but in compli∣ance with the humour of the common People who as Superstitious in a high degree might be perswaded to imagine it a Sin to feed on Flesh shou'd they observe their Priests refuse to do it  Their fre∣quent Fasting  THEY place the greatest Merit in the World in duly keeping  Lent  which they observe with wonderful Devotion and Austerity and indeed the vulgar Sort as knowing little else of their Religion take such care to be beforehand in this Point that I have frequently observ'd them fast Day after Day without complaining and it may be said within the bounds of Truth that they fast three Days out of every seven  They Fast on  Christmass Day  AMONG the many other Days whereon the Stamp of Custom has in∣joyn'd their Fasting 'tis observable they always do it upon  ChristmassDay  with double Strictness what their reason is they cou'd not tell me use has made it now a  Law  and they esteem it as their Duty to obey and keep it  Their me∣thods of As∣sembling to Devotion  AS for Churches they have very few and those they have are so de∣cay'd by Time or Accident that they are hardly fit to hold an Audience wherefore they assemble to their publick Prayers and other Ceremonies in low private Chambers where they may be free from Noise and un∣disturb'd in the calm Exercise of their Religion They are seldom fond of Painting but are so entirely of the  Greeks  Opinion as to  Sculptures  that they cannot bear to see 'em in their Houses  The  Turkish  Policy to de∣stroy their Churches  IT is observable that tho' the  Turks  in many things give greater Tole∣ration to the  Armenians  than their other Subjects yet they use the same in∣human art to ruin their Religion never giving them Permission to rebuild a Church when once decay'd unless they are brib'd to it at so high a Rate that 'tis a very rare attempt to ask a Licence for that purpose from the  Turkish Officers  who always learn one Art that is to make the  most  if not the best of their Preferments  Their Po∣stures of Prayer  THEIR postures when at Prayers is like the  Turks  crosslegg'd those past they elevate their Bodies to a straiter Pitch and with the greatest Silence listen to their Priest who reads from the  Chaldean Tongue  such Chapters as he thinks convenient still expounding as he goes along the Mystery of what he reads  Their Forms of Publick Devotion  THIS Service over they again repeat their Prayers in the same Po∣sture as before the Priest excepted who then always turns his Face di∣rectly to the  Altar  and with lifted Hands and Eyes invokes a Blessing on his zealous  Auditory  Prayers once over every Man as he goes round the Room in order to depart kneels down before the Priest or Bishop if there is one present and while he kisses his left Hand is strok'd upon the  Head  and  Bless'd  devoutly by the other  IT is at these  Assemblies  that the Priest or Bishop nominates the Feasts or Fasts which are to be observ'd the Week ensuing after which no plea of Business or extraordinary Occasions can prevail to get a Dispensation or acquit them from the Duty and in order to prevent all expectation of suc∣ceeding in Petitions of that nature they have form'd a Sentence which by common use is grown a Proverb and is generally painted in the Letters of their Language on the Walls or Cielings of their Places of Devotion and the Houses where they dwell The Words are these  An  Armenian  Proverb  As the Almighty God is infinitely greater than the World and all therein by so much ought our earthly Business to give way to his great Worship  I told my Reader in the beginning of the Chapter that the People of this Nation are extreamly Poor and yet entirely Honest an extraordina∣ry Character yet what they very well deserve as what I am about to tell you is a fair  Example  A Story of a young  Arme∣nian  land his Honesty  THERE was at the abovenam'd City of  Tyberis  a young Man not thirty Years of Age the only Son of an  Armenian  Merchant who was yet so poor as hardly to be capable of living in a tolerable Credit This young Man was much in  Love  with the fair Daughter of a Countryman of his who gratefully return'd his Passion with an equal value But both these Families were Poor and Honest therefore cou'd not see the smallest possi∣bility of doing well shou'd they by Marriage suffer the fond Couple to encrease a Charge they found it very difficult to bear without ad∣dition  A bad Condi∣tion  THE hardship of their Fortune and sincerity of their Affection half distracted them when they reflected that the Barrier which prevented their so much desir'd Bliss was never likely to be taken off and found that every Day as  Love  encreas'd their  Poverty  grew greater  THE Poor young Man industriously inclin'd had try'd all ways of bettering his Circumstances but had much ado by all his Labour to sup∣port a Livelyhood and was become so melancholy by the misery of his Condition oppress'd at once by  Love  and  Indigence  that he cou'd find no Comfort but in the Conversation of his  Mistress  and  that  a sort of  anxious  Joy  An anxious Pleasure  because as often as it represented to his Thoughts the  Blessings  he shou'd gain by her  Possession  it  recoil'd  upon his Memory that 'twas almost impos∣sible to obtain so great a happiness  HE often walk'd disconsolately out of Town and wandred up and down unmindful of his Steps indulging  Solitude  as a lov'd means of Con∣templation  one Evening  very late the  Moon  shone bright and led him on in a smooth  Walk  that ran along the  great high Road  till he was met by a  grave Man  in habit of a  Pilgrim  who saluted him and beg'd he wou'd sup∣port him to the Town or he shou'd faint before he reach'd it the young  Armenian  looking earnestly upon his Face perceiv'd his Colour gone and all the Marks of sudden Illness plain to be discover'd  HE ask'd the  Pilgrim  whither he was bound who told him to  Con∣stantinople  and again demanding if he had any  Friends  within the City of  Tyberis  was inform'd that he was quite a Stranger and design'd to take his Lodging in some  publick Han  or open place of Entertainment such as is elsewhere describ'd for  Inns  and  Houses  of  Accommodation  are not met with in the  Eastern  Countrys  A compassio∣nate Action  THE good  Armenian  presently consider'd that the Usage he wou'd meet with in a  publick Han  cou'd no ways be agreable to his weak Condition and invited him to lie a  Night  or two at his Father's House by giving him a frank assurance of a hearty Welcome this kind offer was immediately embrac'd with many thanks by the  Sick Pilgrim  so he return'd again and led his  Guest  back with him using him with great Civility and Entertain∣ing him in every kind as well as the  Condition  of the one requir'd or the o∣thers  Purse  cou'd possibly  afford him  An Artifice to prevent Discovery  FIVE Days the  Pilgrim  kept his Bed and in that time wou'd often talk with the  Armenian  and his  Father  still concealing who he was and taking every now and then an occasion to complain of his  Misfortunes  and his  Poverty  till on the fifth Day in the Evening he desir'd the Company of the  Young Man alone  who came accordingly and as he us'd to do began to comfort the  Sick Man  with hopes of quick Recovery  AT last the  Pilgrim  interrupting his Discourse began to  weep  and ta∣king him by the Hand inform'd him that he found himself so weak that he had now no longer  hopes  of  Life  but begg'd him as he wish'd for Happiness hereafter to comply with the Request he was about to make him  The Speech of a dying Pilgrim  I am  says he  a  Merchant  who have traded many Years in  Jewels  which by travelling on  foot  and in the Habit of a  Pilgrim  I have always carry'd safe when others have been robb'd of all they had Almighty God has pleas'd to bless me with considerable  Substance  most of which is now about me in rich  Diamonds  neatly fastned in some corners of my Cloaths I have no  Wife  or  Child  but one  poor Mother  at  Constantinople  long main∣tain'd by my good Fortune her I make my  Heiress  she knows best what poor Relations at her Death to leave it to Now I design to write a Letter and for fear she loses all if sent her by the  Caravan  for  God Al∣mighty's Sake  do you in Person take the Charge of what I give you see her and inform her how I  dy'd  and where you  bury  me The  Charges  you have been so generously at and what my  private Funeral  may cost you this  small Purse  contains a Sum of Gold sufficient to repay you but to bear the  Charges  of your Journey to my  Mother  and in some degree reward your Goodness I will give you two  good Diamonds  for your self and then deliver all the rest to your safe Custody  A great Sur∣prise  HE ended there and from a  Pocket  in the  bosom  of his  Vest  that then lay by him took a Purse in which were  Eighteen Gold Chequins  of  Turkey  value  each ten Shillings  and deliver'd it to the  Armenian  who was more surpriz'd to see him  rip  the  corners  of his  Cloaths  and take out  two  and  twenty  noble  Diamonds  which had been the Business of the  Journey  he fell short in  Two  according to his promise he presented him withal each worth about an  hundred English Pounds  the  other Twenty most  of equal value he committed to his Charge took  Pen  and  Ink  and  writ  a Line or two directed to his  Mother  and the next Day died as he before imagin'd  A wonderful Example of Honesty  HERE was a Temptation few I fear in the  Armenian  's Circumstan∣ces wou'd so nobly have resisted he conceal'd the  Jewels  least his  Father  or his  Mistress  shou'd have tempted him to keep them own'd the Money bu∣ried the  dead Pilgrim  who I shou'd have told you was himself an  Armenian  writ a Letter and enclos'd  one Diamond  in it to assist his  Father  and with∣al inform'd him of the whole Concern he left this Letter on his  Chamber Table  sold the  second Jewel  for his own Expences and departed early  one Morning  with the  Pilgrims Weeds  belonging to the late deceas'd first having sow'd all up as they had been before the Owner had unrip'd 'em for his Satisfaction  IN short he brought the  Jewels  safe to  Constantinople  gave 'em with the  Letter  to the Woman they were sent to wou'd not take the least Re∣ward confessing he was paid beforehand and prepar'd for his  Return  to  Persia  after a short Stay of  thirteen Days  with the Mother of his  deceas'd Countryman  A generous Action of a  Persian  Envoy  BUT  Vertue  seldom fails Reward the  Story  was immediately spread round the City and among the rest a  Persian Envoy then  about returning to his Country hearing the report resolv'd to see such Worth encourag'd sent for the young Man inform'd himself of his Condition took him back to  Persia  in his Train and there presented him before the  King  as an  Ex∣ample  of surprizing Honesty and an  Object  highly worthy of his  Royal Favour  A Reward of Vertue  THE  King  commanded a great Sum of Money to be given him and learning that he was brought up a  Merchant  order'd him to be the Man with whom the  Court  shou'd for the future deal for all their Necessaries in his way of  Traffick  and accordingly he soon grew rich by that Advan∣tage and the many which attended the great  Character  it gave him so that he not only  Married  his  old Mistress  but in a few Years rais'd his  Family  to be the most considerable of all his Country a happiness he very well de∣serv'd for such a rare  Example  of an inborn  Honesty  and generosity of  Na∣ture  commonly inherent to the People of that Nation  CHAP XXIV Of the  Copties  The Original of the  Copties  TWAS in the  Infancy  of  Christian Doctrine  that the old Inhabi∣tants of many parts of  Egypt  chiefly such as border'd upon  Aethi∣opia  were Converted to the Faith of  Christ  by the successful Preaching of the Noble  Eunuch  who had been inspir'd by  Philip  with the purest Notions of  Religion  and Morality Those early Converts who embrac'd the  Gospel there  transmitted it industriously to the Practice of  Posterity  and Multitudes of the  Egyptians  constantly profess'd the Doctrine of  Christianity  thro' all the  Ages  of inhuman  Persecution  and the  Modern Offspring  of those Ancient People are the  Sect  nam'd  Copties  whom this Chapter treats of  The Causes of their Igno∣rance  BUT as  humane Nature  is  alone  too weak a  Prop  for  Faith  and the my∣sterious Knowledge of  Religion  so the want of  Spiritual Directors  thro the  Labyrinth  of Darkness which attended the disorders of successive  Persecutions  has involv'd them in a  Gulph  of  zealous Ignorance  and taught 'em an  unna∣tural  and  incoherent  mixture of the Superstitious Practices of  Pagan  Ceremo∣nies with the heavenly Rites of their profess'd  Christianity  Circumcision us'd among them and why  'TIS this Misfortune has confounded their religious Observation of the  Sa∣crament of Baptism  with the Heathenish Custom of an early  Circumcision  which they still observe but rather out of Veneration to the Practice of their  Ancestors  than any Notion of its  Efficacy  in religious Matters That it was an  ancient Custom  we are undeniably convinc'd from the Assertion of so old a  Pen  as that of  Herodotus  who declares it to have been observ'd among that People long before the  Age  he liv'd in they  Circumcise  their  Children  at  eight  Days old but  Baptise  them not till on the  fortieth  Tainted with the  Jacobin  Herely  THEY were originally tainted with the  Jacobin Heresy  and rigidly maintain'd the Doctrine of  one sole Nature in our Saviour  long before  Jaco∣bus  preach'd up that Opinion in the  Eastern  Parts of  Syria  they are so very cautious least by chance they shou'd expose his  Person  to the Proof of a  Di∣vision  that tho' they own him  God  and  Man  and  perfect  in both  Essences  they will not venture to distinguish one from t'other  How agree∣ing with or dissenting from the Church of  Rome  THEY administer the  Sacrament  in both kinds especially to  Infants just Baptiz'd  They stigmatize the  Church of Rome  with  Heresy  yet by the too prevailing vigilance of  Missionaries  sent from many Parts of  Italy  great num∣bers of them frequently embrace the  Romish Doctrine  they value not the Resolutions of those  General Councils  held since that of  Ephesus  and with an universal detestation of the Notions of a  Purgatory Praying for the Souls of the Deceas'd  and  Extreme Ʋnction  dissent from those three favorite  Points  of  Roman Doctrine  THEY have a  Patriarch  over them who takes his Title from the Town of  Alexandria  but commonly resides at  Grand Cairo  or sometimes at a large City call'd  Saieta  An ancient City  six days Journey higher on the  River Nilus  all Inhabited by unmix'd numbers of the  Copties  here 'tis said our  Savi∣our  and the  Virgin Mary  liv'd when flying from the Rage of  Herod  they sojourn'd in the Land of  Egypt  till the Death of that oppressive Tyrant  Here  likewise may be seen the Ruins of a noble Structure  stately  in the very  Dust  it lies in which the  Copties  tell us was in former times a  Cha∣pel  built by the religious  Helena  Mother to  Constantine the Great  and Con∣secrated to the  Virgin  in commemoration of her Residence in that  ancient City  The  Copties  keep  Lent  strictly  THEY are almost as strict observers of  Lent  as the  Armenians  never eating Flesh therein but in the Night unless on  Saturdays  and  Sundays  but upon those Days they hold it as a Sin to Fast  A painful form of Wor∣ship  PECULIARLY Devout and painfully Religious is their rigid form of Worship for on  Saturday at Midnight  they are summon'd to their  Churches  where they neither  sit stand kneel  or use the common Postures of a Man but till the  Sunday Noon  support themselves by leaning on a kind of  Crutches  Boys admit∣ted into Or∣ders  THE  Priest officiating  is cover'd with a  Veil  of fine white Linen and assisted by  three little Boys  attir'd not much unlike himself on whom as on great numbers of young Children they conferr the  minor Orders  of their  Priesthood  assuming their  Authority  for such a Practice from a weak Inter∣pretation of that part of the  Gospel  where  our Saviour  uses the Expression  Suffer little Children to come unto me and prevent them not for of such is the Kingdom of Heaven  Their publick Prayers  THEY frequently exalt their Voices and accompany the  Priest  in strange and unintelligible Noises using  some  the ancient  genuine Egyptian Language  now almost forgotten  some  the  Moorish Dialect  and  some  the  Tur∣kish  oftentimes the  Priest  not much unlike the  Romish elevation of the Host  lifts up above his Head a  Cloth  of  Crimson Colour  under which is plac'd the  Consecrated Sacrament  Other Cu∣stoms in usea∣mong them  THEY Sing the  Psalms  of  David  through at every Meeting sometimes a Chapter of the  Old  but oftner of the  New and more respected Testament  as Pen'd by  Nicomedes  they pay no Reverence to the  Pictures  of  our Saviour  and the  Virgin Mary  nor permit them to be plac'd about the  Altar  tho' they  commonly  are met with in the other  Corners  of their  Churches  Reliques of Martyrs  AT the Entrance of their Churches which can seldom boast  Magnifi∣cence  or  Ornament  you see on either side  square Chests  pil'd one above a∣nother and in these they keep the  Ashes Bones  or  other Reliques  of those who having been deluded by the strong Insinuations of the  Turks  to turn  Mahometans  have afterwards repented their  Apostacy  and openly professing a  Return  to the  Religion  they before abandon'd have been  put to Death  up∣on it and defended their  unshock'd  and  persecuted Recantation  by the painful  Tryal  of a glorious  Martyrdom  Men and Wo∣men kept a∣part  THE  Women  like the  Turks  are separated in their  Churches  from the Conversation of the  Men  and plac'd in  Galleries  all  lettic'd over  to pre∣vent  Inspection  They kiss their Hands at coming in and lay the  Right  up∣on the  Left  proceeding with a  Gravity  becoming their  Devotion  Their Habits and Subjecti∣on  THEIR Habits differ from the  common Greeks  in nothing but a kind of  SkullCap  of a close and humble Shape which all the  Copties  wear upon their Head They live in great Subjection to the  Turks  pay  double Taxes  and are hourly liable to the oppressive Violences of unbounded  Tyranny  and  swift Injustice  Sciences de∣cay'd among them  THEIR  Ignorance  is  great  and  universal  and their  Morals  consequent∣ly  weak  and poorly guarded  Sciences  are almost lost at least decay'd ex∣treamly in the  Practice  of their  Students  HOWEVER whether it proceeds from  real Inclination  or a Notion that the Character of  Conjurer  wou'd better suit  them  than another Peo∣ple by the Stories which the  Scriptures  and  Tradition  tell the World of the prodigious Operation of those fam'd  Magicians  among their Ancestors who strove so wonderfully to excel the Power of  God  in  Moses  I say I know not which of these excites their  Study  Great Lovers of Magick  but 'tis very certain that they all incline to practice  Magick  or at least such  juggling Arts  as  with the Vul∣gar  may intitle them to that denomination  Admirable Jugglers  THEY confidently boast a Power by the assistance of  Familiar Spirits  to inform Inquirers any thing they ask particularly in Affairs of  Love  and 'tis indeed a very pleasant Entertainment to behold how some of the  Poli∣test  of these  Jugglers  will impose on simple Crowds of  Listners  by the out∣ward Artifices of a  learn'd Appearance  while by subtle means they learn the Business of the  Querist  from  himself  or  Company  and then  amaze  him with a Declaration of no more than what he just before has told him  'TIS pleasant to behold 'em  burning Leaves describing Circles melting Wax  and using all the  outward Gestures  which we read of in the Works of  ancient Poets  to have been observ'd by  Sorcerers  or others in their  Magic In∣cantations  such as that of  Simaetha  in the  second Eidyl  of  Theocritus  Theoc Eidyl  d  c  c  Go  Ïynx on the wings of Passion move  And to my Presence  drag  my  tardy Love  Delphis  torments me but I'll take

 Flames  consume my  Perjur'd Dear  Go  Ïynx on the Wings of Passion move  And to my Presence drag my  tardy Love  As I now melt this  Wax  help'd from above  Just so  let  Myndian Delphis  melt with  Love  And as I  whirl  my  brazen Wand  around  Let him before my  Gate  in  Circles  trace the Ground  Go  Ïynx  on  the Wings of Passion move  And to my Presence  drag  my  tardy Love  No wonder that their Mo∣rals are not excellent  BUT certainly it cannot well be look'd upon a  Wonder  that  Morality  shou'd boast no fix'd Impression on the Minds of Men inur'd to  Artifice  and  Treacherous Practices  by the perpetual Dangers they have been expos'd to by the  Wars  and  Persecutions Changes  and  Subversions  which have constant∣ly attended their unhappy Country thro' a  Course of Revolutions  for so ma∣ny Ages when we find that  even our selves  divided as we are from all the World protected from the Miseries of  War  and  Rapine  and indulg'd by  Heaven  in all the Blessings of  Productive Nature  have no great Cause to think our  Morals generally speaking  better than our Neighbours  A strange and lab'ring Sect among the  Copties  AMONG the many Orders of  Religion  now profess'd by these  Cop∣ties  there is  one  very  odd  and  new Opinion  prevalent among them a  certain Sect  who Contemplating seriously and with incessant Application on the numerous Frailties of  Humanity  engage themselves  by Oath  in the most solemn manner every Year they live to take upon them some new  Mystery  or way of Living till they find  if possible  some State of Life  entirely hap∣py  These by turns are  Soldiers Merchants Husbandmen  and every thing their Substance can create them and the Good they do by this uncommon Practice of  profess'd Variety  appears conspicuously in the repeated Declarati∣ons which they daily make in Publick Places telling those who gather round them that  Experience  has convinc'd them  True Felicity  attends not such and such a Life for such and such occurring Reasons weighing all the  Good  with all the  Bad  of every Man's Condition and discovering how much the weighty  Evils overpoize the Balance  Their never ending La∣bours  THUS are the Lives of these unwearied Wretches spent in searches of  Content  a  Fairy Blessing  talk'd of like the  Phoenix  but unknown like that and never to be gain'd on this side  Heaven  yet they toil incessantly and drudge away their Moments in a kind of  Interrogatory Contemplation  like the learn'd  Ausonius  who thus expresses the convincing Proofs of  Mortal Im∣perfection  Auson  Eidyl th

travelling thro' their Country into their Acquaintance They receive and entertain him with a deep respect and waiting patiently till he has ask'd as many  Questions  as he pleases of their  way of Living  put great num∣bers of inquisitive Demands on  him  and listen with a close and wonderful  Delight  to hear the  Stories  which a  Stranger  tells them either of  his own  or  other Countries  NOR is it any ways  improbable  that  this  shou'd be the reason which induces such vast numbers to profess the Business of a  Guide  attending  Tra∣vellers  from Place to Place as often as the  Arabs  will permit them  An Arbitrary Practice of the  Arabs  but these  last  are  Lords  of  them  and their  Pretentions  and are well acquainted with the  Profits  thence arising wherefore they will  rarely  give the  Copties  liberty to serve as  Guides  to  Christian Travellers  but undertake the Task  themselves  and  thence  extort considerable Sums of Money in proportion to their  Carriage Avarice  or  Honesty  CHAP XXV Of the  Zinganees  or the Race of the  Gypsies  NOW Reader have I brought you to a sort of People who for every kind of Villany and unexampled Practices of Guilt in its most elevated Insolence may justly boast themselves without a Rival  Impunity  encourages them all to  Sin  and  independent Ar∣rogance  protects them in it They are shun'd by all degrees of Men and all Men equally by  them  detested They are  Nature's Outcast  and the black  In∣festers  of Humanity and common Goodness and of all the World may best lay claim to the Profession of a  Maxim  which the  Roman Satyrist  ex∣presses thus  Juv Sat    Aude aliquid brevibus Gyaris Carcere dignum  Si vis esse aliquis probitas laudatur alget  Wou'd you be  Great  and  dreaded  by Mankind  Dare to do  Mischief  never yet design'd  Contrive some  Ill  that may the Rope deserve  Then shall you thrive if  Good  be  prais'd  and  Starve  YOU shall rarely apprehend a  Zinganee  or execute him for a  Crime  but he will readily confess vast numbers more than e'er he was detected in their  only aim  is  Wickedness  and  that  they grow inimitable  Proficients  in They seldom differ one from t'other or if  some  have accidentally been more successful than  the rest  in bringing  Mischiefs  to  perfection  'tis because their Op∣portunities have been more favourable and proceeds not from a weaker Inclination to the Practice of Iniquity Their Guilt is  thus  the same and therefore I may well excuse the universal Wishes of the  honester Inhabitants  of the  Eastern Countries  who profess an open and deserv'd Abhorrence of the  Wretches  and their Customs desiring nothing more than their very Race might  wholly  be  extirpated  Juv Sat    Nam scelus intra se tacitum qui cogitat ullum  Facti crimen habet cedo si conat a peregit  For he who has his  Will  to  Evil  brought  And  secretly  dares form a  Wicked Thought  Commits the  Crime  that his Consent has won  Or  Sins  as much as if  'twere really done  BUT e'er I paint the  Morals  and  inhuman Nature  of these People 'twill be proper to inform my Reader  who they are  and having trac'd 'em to their black  Original  I will proceed to the Relation of their  Present State  and lay 'em open in the scatt'red Baseness of their Modern Cir∣cumstances  The History and Original of the  Zinga∣nees  'TWAS in the Reign of  Sultan Selym  the successful  Turkish Emperour  who overthrew the Government of the  Circassian Mamalukes  and added  Egypt  to his own Dominions that the few remaining  Soldiers  of that Name who had escap'd the Slaughter and retir'd in little Numbers to the  Borders  of the  Desart  were encourag'd by a  certain daring Slave  nam'd  Zinganeus  to assemble in one Body and make use of those  offensive Arms  their hasty Flight had left them to their best advantage they consented to the moti∣on and upon examination found themselves a formidable Body able to defend their Ground by reason of the difficulty of access against the Power of all Invaders  A Salvage kind of Life  THUS they liv'd some time made Nightly Inrodes to the fertil Pa∣stures on the Banks of  Nilus plunder'd Towns destroy'd Inhabitants drove off their Cattle  and committed all Outrages void of fear and free from Pu∣nishment not only keeping so secure a Guard that they defended their Possessions but admitting daily Numbers of their  old Companions  who de∣serted to their Party in considerable Bodies as often as they found conveni∣ent Opportunities  THE  Turks  who dreaded what might be the Consequences of this threat∣ning growth of Power sent Great Commanders with some regular Forces to  reduce  them to Obedience who fell short in their Designs and were sent back  half ruin'd  to assure their Officers they were to cope with greater Strength than they imagin'd  IN short the  Turks  perceiv'd so great a Difficulty in the Method they must take to bring 'em to Subjection that they rather chose to offer Terms of Friendship and Accommodation which the  Mamalukes  as rea∣dily accepted of as growing weary of the  Dangerous Alarums  they were Hourly Subject to so that a Peace was soon concluded  Articles of Accommoda∣tion  and the Articles thereof Obliging the  Circassians  to lay down their Arms permitted them to exercise what other way of Living their desires wou'd lead 'em to make choice of  BUT  Civil Discipline  agreeing rarely with the  Military Genius  of licen∣tious Multitudes they grew unruly and became so prejudicial to the common Interest that the offended  Turks  at last grew weary of forgiv∣ing and Enacted a degree that every  ZINGANEE for they were so distin∣guish'd from the Name of their Ringleader  shou'd in Fourteen Days depart the Kingdom  They are Ba∣nish'd  Egypt  This was so severely put in Execution that in less than two Months space not one remain'd who  Publickly  durst own himself of  that Denomination  for it was made Lawfull for what Man soever met them when their Date expired to  Take Kill Enstave  or  Ʋse  them as he thought convenient  NO Man from that time forward e'er knew certainly what became of  Zinganeus  their Commander tho 'tis commonly believ'd he staid in  Egypt  where at present  his Posterity  and that of  his Companions  openly dare own themselves A certain Prophecy is spread about relating to some fu∣ture hopes Predominant on the Opinion of the  Zinganees  tho  few  among the  Turks  regard or Value it The  Prophecy  as 'tis Express'd in the  Egypti∣an Language  varies nothing from the following purpose  A  Gypsie  Pro∣phecy  Years  over  Years  shall Roll  Ages  o'er  Ages  Slide  Before the  Worlds Controul  Shall check the  Crescents Pride  Banish'd  from Place to Place  Wide as the  Oceans Roar  The Mighty  Gypsie Race  Shall Visit ev'ry Shore  But when the  Hundredth Year  Shall three times  Doubled be  Then shall  an End  Appear  To all their  Slavery  Then shall the  Warlike Pow'rs  From  distant Climes  return  Egypt  again be  Ours  And  Turkish Turrets  Burn  A Vain and Groundless hope  THIS  Prophecy  has won so far upon the Miserable  Romnant  of the  Zinganees  in  Egypt  that they all expect as certainly to see the  Restoration  of their  Empire  in the Downfall of the  Turks  as the most  Rigid Jews  be∣lieve and wait for the return of their  Messias  But how wide from  Probability  their notion lies let  any Man  decide who will reflect on the Prodigious difference between the  Turks  and  Them  in  Number  and  Authority  The Wan∣dring Lives of the Banish'd  Gypsies  THOSE  Zinganees  who had not Courage to continue in their Coun∣try in contempt of the decree exhibited against them spread themselves in  Banishment  thro' every corner of the World and finding it a necessary  prudence to consider on some means of  Livelyhood  they took upon them the Denomination of  Foretellers  of the Accidents attending every Per∣sons Life Pretending to a natural Gift of  Prophecy  and finding it an easy matter to Impose upon the World by such Pretentions the rather be∣cause many  Families  among them had by  Art  or  Nature  really reach'd a Wonderful Ability in such like  Practices  they Flourish'd for a while and grew considerably Rich in many Countries  Their First Arrival in  England  AMONG the rest great Numbers Flock'd to  England  Travell'd up and down from Place to Place with Children at their Backs beg'd leave to he in  Barns  told  Fortunes  for their Livelyhood and when they could not fair∣ly get  Provisions  Stole 'em with an admirable Cunning till the many Mis∣chiefs which attended the Permission of these  Stroling Hypocrites  occasi∣on'd  several Acts  to pass in order to extirpate their Fraternity  THE Laws which were from time to time Enacted to that end had such effect that they were soon Transported hence in such surprizing Numbers that the few mean Wretches now pretending to the Character of  Gypsies  are not really so but such whose Miserable Circumstances have reduc'd 'em to a sordid  Imitation  of the Vices and Pretences of those Banish'd Per∣sons  The Original of the Word Gypsie  to whom Originally our  Forefathers  gave the Name of  Gyptians  or  Egyptians  to denote the Country they belong'd to but the word has been corrupted by the course of Time to the Present Vulgar Pronunciation  GYPSIES  BUT tho' the Prudence of our  cautious Ancestors  found means to rid this Nation of such Troublesome Inhabitants few other Countries took that care to free themselves from their Encumb'ring Multiplication  Turkey  very full of  Gypsies  every part of  Turkey  is especially so Pester'd with 'em that you seldom Tra∣vel Four and Twenty Hours without Encountring them  Their Way of Living  THEY are Divided into  Tribes  Acknowledge no dependance  on  or Duty  to  the Power of any  Government  whatever they have no  Laws  a∣mong themselves but mingle  Lustfully  together in the most  Incestuous  man∣ner never  Marrying  but using all  in common Women Goods  and all they Boast of  THEY Wander up and down with  Asses  Loaden with their  Tents  and other dirty Necessaries always Pitching their Black Camp as near some  Town of Note  as possible  Excellent Smiths  and Working commonly as  Smiths  particularly famous for the making  Hatchets  of an  Edge  so excellently temper'd that no  Nail  can turn it they are Hir'd sometimes for every kind of  Drudgery  but frequently refuse to Work and never tarry longer in a Place than till they have obtain'd as much as  Stealing  or their  Labour  can induce 'em to the hopes of  THUS in time they Visit  every  Part of every  Country  hated by Mankind and  Preying  on the Losses of their  Fellow Creatures  void of Principle and con∣sequently of  Humanity  If any of them Die they make a  Hole  within his  Tent  and Bury him about a Foot below the Surface never using  Coffin Shrowd  or  Decent Ceremony  Scoffing Publickly at  every Law  and all  Religions    Their Atheisti∣cal Principles  openly de∣claring they believe no  GOD  but impiously use no other Argument than that of Insolent and Ignorant  Obstinacy  telling  Christians  who rebuke their Wickedness that they have Daily reason to distrust the Notions of a  Godhead  since if there  were  a  Power  so  Mighty  and  Omniscient  as  God  is represented he wou'd never hear himself  Blasphem'd  and  Ridicul'd  at such a Rate as he is Hourly by their common Practice without some speedy Judgment on their Guilt This  Simple Notion  made me think upon an Ancient  Precedent  deliver'd to Posterity by  Martial  in his Book of  Epigrams  Mart  Epig  Nullos esse Deos inane Coelum  Affirmat  Selius  probatque quod se  Factum dum negat hoc videt Beatum  Selius  affirms there is no  God  in  Heav'n  And the  sole Cause  for  that  Opinion giv'n  Is that while  thus  he dares a  God  deny  He  Prospers daily  and no  Plague  draws nigh  Their Cu∣stoms and Humour  THEY commonly go  naked  or at least the  major Part  affect not Dressing  Nature  stains them of a  tawny Hue  and the  unresisted  Influence of a continual  Sun  encreases their Deformity they never  wash  their  Hands  or  Faces  but permit their  Hair  and  Nails  to grow to most amazing lengths They will not suffer  Travellers  to pass without accosting them extracting Money by repeated Declarations of the  Good  or  Evil Fortune  which is like∣ly to attend them But what most amaz'd me is that they assume the Impudence of giving good Advice exhorting them to  Piety  and all the  Graces  of  Humanity  concluding commonly their  Hypocritic Lectures  with these Words  Be Dutiful to  God  your  Parents  and your  Prince  and let the Blessings of them all be showr'd upon you  WHEN I perceiv'd that  such as these  cou'd give  Advice  who are the  open Enemies  of common Goodness I reflected with a wonderful surprize upon the Truth of an old  Maxim  I remember to have  read  in some  Greek Author  A  Graecian  Maxim  How readily do all our  Natures  tend  To give  Advice  with  Prudence  to a Friend  But  if we Err our selves  we know it not  At least our  Selfaffection  cloaks the Blot  A Story of the Impu∣dence of a cer∣tain  Zinganee  THE  Native Insolence  of these licentious Wretches may be guess'd at by a  Story  I will tell you At a little  Country Town  in  Turkey  where great Numbers of the  Zinganees  had pitch'd their  Tents  a  Friend  of mine who kept a Summer House retir'd to pass a Month or two and having been inform'd how Skillful they were fam'd to be in making  Hatchets  of an ad∣mirable temper had the Curiosity to purchase one at the dear rate of  three and twenty Shillings  in the Money of that Country  HE  try'd  his  Hatchet  which was neatly made and had a fine  turn'd Helve  and  Leather Case  to keep the Head from wet and found it so ex∣ceeding Good that he commended it extreamly to the Man who made it and profess'd he wou'd not lose it for its  double Value  A Cheating Temper  NOTHING cou'd have been more  welcom News  or  fairer Invitation  to the  Zinganee  than this he presently resolv'd to find some opportunity of stealing back the  Hatchet  that he might oblige the  Gentleman  to buy ano∣ther or reward him well for the pretence of having found the  old one  IN short he  watch'd  a day or two and having made his observation of the Place 'twas laid in soon found means to get it and was met one Mor∣ning by the Owner as he hasten'd from the Chamber with the mark of  Theft  about him The  Gentleman  surpriz'd to see a  Zinganee  in his  Apart∣ment  took him by the Arm as he was passing by and ask'd him somewhat  roughly what his Business was and whither he was carrying his Hatchet The  Gypsy an experienc'd Artist  answer'd nothing but with elevated Eyes and shaking Head endeavour'd silently to get away  A wonderful Assurance  but when the  Gentle∣man  encreas'd his anger and began to call his Servants to secure him with a bold undaunted Look and Tongue as nimble as his Fingers he began to talk away his Guilt in Speeches to the following purpose  The Speech of a Gypsy  FOOL that you are but  Christians  will be blind and who can help it Now I know you think that I came hither with design to  steal your Hatchet  O poor Frailty of your common Understanding I have Skill  honest Infidel  and by that Skill knew certainly that if this  Hatchet  was not taken from you this Morning at  Eleven a Clock  and just three Minutes after you wou'd have been inclin'd to try its Metal on you Log of Wood and so had surely cut your  Right Leg  half asunder I have Skill and valued you and so prevented it by seizing on the evil Instrument See here I will not be dismay'd I prize your  Good  above your  Friendship  and will  notwithstanding this  prevent your Danger  HE had no sooner spoke these Words but  off he ran  as fast as he was able nor was overtaken tho' the  Servants  follow'd him till he had reach'd a  Well  of an  unfathomable Depth  and there he stopp'd but first threw in the  Hatchet  which he knew cou'd never be recover'd from so deep a Bot∣tom  The Success of a Cheat  THE Gentleman who guess'd the  Zinganee  's Design cou'd scarce re∣frain from laughing at the  Air  with which he carry'd off his  Impudence  'twas dangerous to beat him tho' he wish'd he cou'd have ventur'd it in  short  the  Gypsy  won his point and still maintaining that his value for the Person of the Gentleman had made him throw away the former  Hatchet  got the making of another like it  I should have told you that they always chuse some  even spot of Ground  to pitch their Tents where the Men and Women  Sing  and  Dance  in auk∣ward  Gestures  all Day long  run hop  and toy away their Hours in various kinds of active Entertainments  Another Story of the Gypsies  I Lay in Company with several other  English Gentlemen  at a large Town in  Thrace  now call'd  Romania  I think the Place was nam'd  Burgoss  upon a spacious Plain without the City stood the Tents of seve∣ral Tribes of wand'ring  Gypsies  who were us'd to entertain themselves in Dancing till near Midnight and express'd their Satisfaction in each others Conversation by the number of their  Exercises  WE walk'd out one Day to take the Air upon the  Plain  I speak of and were very much surpriz'd to see a Company of  Naked People  of  both Sexes  join'd promiscuously in a kind of  Antic Dance  and leaping up and down with uncouth Noises and indecent Postures which declar'd them Strangers to the smallest Grain of common  Modesty  WE came as near 'em as we cou'd and were immediatly surrounded by their Numbers every Person striving to  foretell our Fortunes  by inspe∣ction of our Hands which we prevented them from doing by an obstinate refusal to admit them near us  An  English  Modesty  ONE Young Gentleman among us of a very  modest  or indeed a  bashful Nature  was half frighted to behold himself encompass'd by a Band of  Na∣ked  Women  and instead of striving to defend himself from their Endeavours kept one Hand before his Eyes and all on fire with  Blushes  turn'd his Head aside and beg'd us to depart from that  Society of Devils  A very dex∣terous and pleasant Cheat  THE  Zinganees  immediately perceiv'd the Opportunity he gave them and with all imaginable expedition  joining Hands  danc'd round him in a Ring and pulling him about from Place to Place laugh'd sung and kiss'd him with a strange Extravagance while several others came about us with a thousand artful  Postures  and  Discourses  to prevent us from observing what they did with our Companion who was so amaz'd to find himself  touch'd kiss'd  and pull'd about by such a  Naked  Multitude of  Females  that he knew not what they were about till they had thrown him down and rolling him along among themselves found means to  pick his Pockets  of his  Gold  and  Silver two good Rings  and a  fine Watch  of  English Work∣manship  The Impunity of  Zinganees  in  Turkey  WE were so much diverted with the  Accident  that we cou'd hardly frame our Tempers for a necessary Quarrel which was all in vain for they had done their Business and went on with their Diversion never minding our repeated Exclamations that they wou'd restore the Gentleman the Prize so lately taken we complain'd to the  Chief Magistrate  upon reent'ring the  City  but found no Redress all Men declining to concern themselves with People over whom they boasted small Authority and from whose Punishment they cou'd not hope  Retaliation  of an Injury receiv'd but wou'd be sure to suffer by a swift  Revenge  and never failing  Malice  so ex∣treamly burthensom and dangerous are the  Gypsies  in the  Eastern World  beyond those here in  England  or indeed in any other Part of  Western Christendom  BUT notwithstanding the abovenam'd Character of the  Zinganees in general  may incline the Reader to believe the Stories he has heard of  Gyp∣sies  and their wonderful Performances are all  Chimaeras  and the wild Production of distemper'd Fancy  Some Gypsies better than the rest  there are really some among them in whose  Families  the Spirit of  Foreknowledge seems  to live beyond Examples common in our Country  THERE is nothing a more certain Truth than that the  Masters  of some  Merchant Ships  have been advis'd to wait a happy Hour least on such and such a Coast they shou'd be  Shipwreck'd  which advice when slighted has appear'd of more  solidity  than they imagin'd by the fatal Loss of both the  Vessel  and the  Lives  of all her  Mariners  Strange Sto∣ries told of some of them  NOT only these but many other such like Accidents and some  more strange  have happen'd  frequently  in many Parts of  Egypt  and the other Coun∣tries where these  Gypsies  live I could relate surprizing things which have been told me with a  good Authority  but I forbear imposing Facts upon my  Reader's Faith  which notwithstanding the concurring Evidences of un∣doubted Witnesses and sometimes  ocular Demonstration  really seem to shock  my own  ONE  Story  I will here  however  tell you and so leave you to your Liberty  believe  or  not believe  that some of those call'd  Zinganees  inherit naturally the  Prophetic  Blessing of  foreknowing  Things to come which they pretend to I can only say they give such  staggering Demonstrations  of a Power beyond a  common Guess  that tho' I was unwilling to give credit to their Attestations I perceiv'd them built upon too sure a Ground to give me any opportunity of contradicting them  A Story of an Accident which befel the Author in his Travels  I Travell'd once with a considerable Number of my Countrymen and other People thro this Country and was musing  Pensively  behind my Company  on Horseback  in an easy Pace when from a kind of  Bushy Covert  on one side the Road there Started out a Man of  Venerable Age Long Beard  and  Decent Habit  In his Shrivel'd Hand he held a Staff and a  Con∣vulsive Palsie  shook his Head with an Incessant Motion  HE came forward Slowly Beckning me to stay as if he had some Busi∣ness of Importance to Communicate I stop'd my  Horse  whose  Main  he  Strok'd  with his  Right Hand  when he came to me and Seizing on my  Boot Top  with his  Left  let fall his Staff and look'd so earnestly upon my Face that I was Struck with a Surprize at the uncommon method of his Salu∣tation  I ask'd him if he  knew me  or had any thing to tell me that he look'd upon me with such  Eagerness  He  Skook his Head  with double force and after having us'd some Wonderfull Expressions which for certain Reasons I forbear to mention here he told me that a dangerous Cloud hung o'er my Head and Threaten'd me with Sudden Death  An unwel∣come Salutati∣on  Perhaps  Young Man  says he you have not half an Hour of Life to come but  Heaven  which only can avert the  Omen  YOU must needs Imagine I was somewhat Startled at this declaration which the Old Man had no sooner made than he departed Looking Back almost at every step he took and lifting up his Eyes in seeming Sign of some concern which look'd like Pity  A Wonderful Adventure  AT last I fansy'd him a kind of Madman and converted Contempla∣tion to a fit of Mirth so Gallop'd on as fast as I cou'd Ride to overtake my Company and entertain 'em with the Story of my odd Adventure But I had not Rode four Hundred Paces when from a Cross Road lead∣ing thro' a kind of Wood on either side appear'd some Horsemen Arm'd with  Javelins  who with elevated Weapons stop'd my Passage and made signs that I should presently alight or they would throw them at me  HERE the Sudden turn of a Reflection on the Probability of that short Space of Life alloted me by the Old Man more deeply terrify'd me than the presence of my Enemies  A Surprizing turn of For∣tune  I made a Shift unknowing in a manner what I did to lay my Hand upon a  Pistol  and had just presented it when all the Horsemen Gallop'd off together with a Motion equally Surprizing for its Swiftness and Occasion  THAT very Moment struck my Ears with the loud Sound of a large  Bra∣zen Trumpet  which a Member of our Company had carry'd with him and the Noise of HorsesFeer as if they Gallop'd  A timely suc∣cour  Presently appear'd the Major part of my Companions who had miss'd me and came Back by the Ad∣vice of an Old Guide among them who Inform'd 'em 'twas a Dangerous thing to Straggle from ones Company in such a part of such a Country  Reflections on the Accident  NOW tho this strange Deliverance might possibly have been unknown to the Old Man who met me and the Notice which he gave me of it the Effect of Chance or a Strange whim Inspir'd by  Providence  'tis surely far more Reasonable to suppose him Master of a more than common share of Knowledge or at least if this Relation does not Tempt the Reader to the same Opinion yet some Private Circumstances which attended it gave me such convincing Proofs of his  just Title  to a  Supernatural Wisdom  that I cannot help declaring I must still believe him Bless'd with a  Pro∣phetic Inspiration  CHAP XXVI Of  Sestos  and  Abydos  the Castles Commanding the  Hellespont  now call'd  Dardanelli  and of the Ruins of  Old Troy  Sestos  and  Abydos  AND now we are about to Travel into  Egypt  by the way of  Con∣stantinople  we must first sail down the  Hellespont  whose Entrance from the  Archipelago  is defended strongly by four  Castles  of consi∣derable Force The  outward two  whereof are  Sestos  and  Abydos  ce∣lebrated by the Pens of ancient Poets for the famous Loves of  Hero  and  Leander  METHINKS I found a certain secret Pleasure in the  very looking  on a Place of such  Antiquity  and while I sail'd along the  River  the complaining Murmurs of the rolling Waters seem'd to mourn  Leander's Drowning  and I cou'd not look upon the venerable  Turrets  of those  aged Buildings  but they brought to my Reflection the  Idea  of those dulcid Strains wherein  Musaus warbles  out the Circumstances of the  melancholy Story  Musaeus de Her Leand  In  ancient Days  upon the famous Shore  Where  Hellaspontic  Waves  incessant  roar  Close to the Sea  on either side the Flood  Here Sestos there  the  near Abydos  stood  Here  his strong Bow the wanton  Cupid  bent  And  one  swift Arrow to  both Cities  sent  The  Youth  vow'd  Love  the  Virgin  own'd the  same  Both  felt  one Passion  and profess'd  one Flame  Leander  was the  Lover  's Name and  She  Was  Hero  call'd as  Fair  as  Maid  cou'd be  She  dwelt in  Sestos  in  Abydos He  Both  blest  alike  in Beauty and in Love  Like  two fair Stars Both  in their  Circles  move  But  you kind Listner  if by chance you roam  And for those  distant Climates  leave your  Home  If in your  Wandrings  you by chance come  there  And led by  Choice  or  Business  curious are  Inquire of some  old Liver  grave and good  Where  once  a  certain ancient Turret  stood  Whereon the  Sestian Hero  chose to stand  And held a  Lantern  in her tender Hand  To teach her  betterhalf  which way to move  And  act the Pilot  to  Leander  's  Love    Look  next  upon those  Seas  which hourly roar  And wash the  Sands  of  old Abydo's  Shore  Weeping  as o'er the  Guilty Scene  they fly  That  Constant Lover  's  Loss  whom  there  they forc'd to  Die  A caution of the  Turks  AND indeed a  Traveller  has here a spacious Opportunity to follow the Advice of this  old Poet  for he is detain'd  three Days  by a fix'd Custom of the Country and must then submit to be examin'd  whither Bound what Countryman  and wait the searching of the Ship by  Officers  deputed from the  Castles  e'er he may have liberty to  Sail  beyond the Reach of their  Artillery  Its causes  THIS Caution is occasion'd by the necessary  Policy  of their sharp Go∣vernment whose  ever wary  Eye forbids the  clearing Foreign Ships  till after such a stay within the Entrance of the  Hellespont  least they shou'd have Commited any Breach of  Articles  before they left the  City  Reflections on the Modern Ignorance of this Country  BUT Oh how much in vain  Musaeus  bids us ask the People of these  Ancient Towns  for Places which they are not only Strangers to the  Know∣ledge  but to the  Names  of Ignorance and Insolence have Clouded  Learn∣ing  in the very Inclinations of the  Modern Masters  of this Country endless  Revolutions  in the very  Face  of  Furrow'd Nature  have Erac'd the Characters of  Former Wisdom  and destroy'd in an  Obscure  and  deep Oblivion  those Lamented  Monuments  of High  Antiquity  The  Darda∣nells  and why so call'd  THE Present Owners call these Castles  Dardanelli  and 'tis a more than Probable Opinion that their  Etymology  derives its Birth from their Vicini∣ty in Situation to the  Trojan Shore  their strength is little if compar'd with the more Artful forms of regular and modern  Fortifications  and are Inca∣pacitated to defend themselves against the Power of  Seiges  carried on by Land Entrenchments all their use arises from the large and Monstrous Bore of many  Cannons  Planted on a Level with the Surface of the  Water  and discharging  Bullets  made of  Stone  of such prodigious size that tho it has been known that Ships have pass'd in safety by the favourable Opportu∣nity of a great  Gale  and  Swelling Waters  'tis a  Rash  and  Dangerous  attempt and ten to one but all who hazard it are Sunk in the Performance  Reflections on the Present State of  Troy  WE Sail from hence and presently gain sight of  TROY  at least the Shore whereon  TROY  stood that Towering City whose Imperial Tur∣rets Brav'd the Fury of Confederate Nations and repuls'd so many Bloody times the Powerfull Armies of the  Graecian Hero  's under whose Renown'd and long defended Walls the Flowing Blood of  Hostile Nations  Bath'd a Soil which Nourish'd Laurels of Immortal Memory whose unbounded Sway and unexhausted Plenty drew the Wonder of an Emulative World as her Brave fall and celebrated Ruin mov'd the Pens of the Sublimest  Poets  in the  Ʋniverse  to Eternize her Glory This Illustrious Scene of Wonders This amazing Field of Action now lies Silent Buried and o'erwhelm'd in the too Melancholy fate of  TROJA FƲIT TROY WAS  NOTHING is remaining worthy of the Monument of so renown'd a City the relentless Teeth of Iron Time have Gnaw'd away her Beauties and the Miserable Remnant of her Ancient Grandeur is confin'd to such a Poor and little Measure  The Mistake of many Tra∣vellers  that those hasty Travellers who think it a suf∣ficient Satisfaction to have seen a Place at distance have inform'd the World that all is now converted into Pasture Ground or that in short a just  Idea  of the present State of that subverted City may be comprehended fully by the Tuneful  Chorus  of  a good old English Ballad  which as I remember tells us  Wast lie those Walls which were so good  And Grass now grows where Troy Town stood  HOWEVER as I was too curious in my Inclinations to rest content with the Reports of other Men in Places where I cou'd inform my self by ocular experience I resolv'd to go on Shore and was the more desi∣rous to become a Witness of the Miserable Blot which had defac'd so fair a Copy  The Grounds of that Mi∣stake  because I very well remembred to have met a  Jew  in  Portugal  who had assur'd me there was more to be Discover'd on the Shore of  Troy  than commonly was credited but the dangerous Barbarity of the Inhabitants was such as rendred it a hazardous attempt and consequently frighted many People from Landing in that Country  THE Captain of the Ship wherein I Sail'd oblig'd me with his Boat while adverse Winds detain'd us on the Coast and one  Francisco Condaliso  an  Italian Priest  who had been long a  Missionary  in the  Eastern Countries  and at present if alive resides at  Padua  consented to Accompany me  The Author Lands at  Troy  we Landed in a very Fair and spacious Harbour probably the same which formerly receiv'd the Boats of  Greece  returning  to and fro  with  Sol∣diers  and  Provisions  WE Walk'd about three Miles up thro' the Country on a Ground still rising from the  Sea  with small Acclivity but overgrown with Brakes and Brambles as indeed is every part which Borders on the  Sea  for many Miles along that Land so that the First Remark I made in this my  Trojan  Expedition was that my  old Countryman  the  Balladmaker  was mistaken in his  Calculation  An account of what he Dis∣cover'd there  WE look'd about as eagerly as possible but look'd in vain and had begun to doubt or even despair of finding any Marks or Ruins of Antiqui∣ty when  Francisco  struck his Foot with Accidental Violence against a Stone and casting down his Eyes imagin'd he Discover'd something like a  Piece of Building  scarce an  Inch  above the Ground all over grown with  Moss  and in a manner cover'd by the  Gross  about it  A Piece of the Old Walls of  Troy  UPON a closer view and digging up the Obstacles which interpos'd themselves we plainly found it was a part of some  Old Wall  and with our  Scymetars  removing all the Brambles and low Bushes near it we Disco∣ver'd it to be near Thirteen Foot in Breadth but Narrower and Higher in some Places than it was in others  TRACING it with more than common difficulty thro' a little Knot of Bushes we had soon lost sight of it and dug in vain as deep as we cou'd thrust our Swords to find if it continued farther on However hav∣ing met so fair encouragement we chearfully proceeded near a  Quarter of a Mile  and there Discover'd at considerable distance something like a  Rug∣ged Wall  or broken  Ruin  of an  Ancient Building  COMING near it we perceiv'd it was the same continued Piece of Building we had lately lost and on a close Examination found it of a black and solid Stone appearing join'd by Mortar which the length of time had notwithstanding hard'ned into Substance of an equal firmness with the Stone it self  A description of it  THE Sizes of the Stones were very different but rather small than of extraordinary Magnitude for few exceeded half a Foot in their Diameter The length of this old Piece of Wall was sixteen Yards the heighth at most exceeded not four Foot but was in many Places broken and in some scarce half a Foot above the Ground  'TWAS strangely overgrown with little Shrubs and divers Plants ap∣pear'd between the Joinings of the Stone which wore a melancholy  Sylvan  Dress of Most and Houseleek  Overgrown with Laurel  But the most engaging Part of the whole Prospect was a seeming Grove of spreading  LaurelTrees  which flourish'd on the top and hanging down on either side protecting as it were the Buil∣ding from the Injuries of Weather methoughts I never saw those kind of  Trees  so justly Planted and I cou'd not help rememb'ring that they look'd as naturally plac'd on these  Old Ruins  as upon the  Celebrated Tomb  of the  harmonious Virgil  in the Neighbourhood of  Naples  A new Disco∣very  ABOUE an Hour we  feasted Curiosity  with a repeated Observation of the pleasing Object and had tarry'd longer in the  same Employment  but were call'd away by the discovery of certain other  Ruins  at a little distance from us which we found to be no more than a  Continuance  of the  Wall  we had before been looking on  Three Monu∣ments or TombStones  BUT while we eagerly examin'd every Part we both took notice of a great disorder'd heap of  Stones  near which there stood three things like  TombStones  and upon approach we found 'em to be really such at least de∣sign'd to represent them they were two Yards long and four Foot broad of common Stone rais'd near two Foot in heighth and cover'd with three fine flat Marbles which by the  Inscriptions  on 'em seem'd to have been done in  Christendom  to gratifie the Humour of some curious Person wil∣ling to amuse  Posterity  when they shou'd find such  Tombs  in such a Place and never know which way they came to be there  BY the Workmanship and the decay'd Condition of the Monuments we judg'd 'em not the Children of the present Age if possibly the last was old enough to Father them with much ado upon the first we came to we cou'd read the following  Epitaph  which I presently remembred to have met with in  Ausonius  on the Death of  Hector  An Epitaph found upon the Tomb of  Hector  Hectoris  hic Tumulus cum quo  sua Troja  sepulta est  Conduntur  pariter qui  periêre  simul  This is brave  Hector  's Tomb  With whom his  Troy  found  Grave  One Fate  did  Both  consume  Both  one  Sepulchre  have  The Tomb of King  Priamus  A little farther stood the second  Tomb  which was  it seems  design'd to represent the Monument of  Priamus  the  Epitaph  which like the first and third is borrow'd from  Ausonius  seems to speak a Royal Mourner and Pa∣ternal Sorrow  Qui Tumulum  Priami  quaerit legat  Hectoris  ante  Ille meus nato quem prius ipse dedi  Hectoris    Patris  simul est commune Sepulchrum  Amborum quoniam juncta ruina fuit  His Epitaph  He who inquires for  Priam  's Grave  Shou'd first on  Hector  's look  That's mine the Tomb to him I gave  For my own Use I took  One common Sepulchre must hold  The Father and the Son  Because at once to Ruin sold  They jointly were undone  The Tomb of  Hecuba  THE third a little shorter than the former two contains an  Epitaph  upon afflicted Majesty in the known Name of  Hecuba  the wretched  Wife  and  Mother  of the latenam'd  Priamus  and  Hector  Quae Regina fui quae claro nata Dymante  Quae  Priami  Conjux  Hectora  quae genui  Hic  Hecuba  injectis perii superobruta saxis  Sed rabie linguae me tamen ulta prius  Fidite ne Regnis Prole stirpe Parentum  Quicunque hoc nostrum  legitis  Her Epitaph  I who was Queen who was the Daughter too  Of  Dymas  whose bright Glories all Men knew  I who was  Priam  's Wife who first gave Birth  To  Hector  whose Great Actions shook the Earth  I  Hecuba  fell here o'erwhelm'd with  Stones  But Curses e'er I fell reveng'd my batter'd Bones  Who e'er you are who shall hereafter see  This  Dogs Sepulchre  which now serves for me  Learn to depend on neither Sons Race State  Or any other slipp'ry Gifts of Fate  For what am I now Dead Tho' Living more than Great  THESE are the  most  and I may say the  only  Things worth Observa∣tion there tho' they deserv'd the Notice of a Traveller and I am there∣fore much surpriz'd that  none  have mention'd them at least no Country∣man of mine I have been told how true I know not that a  French Book  publish'd very many Years ago and call'd  L' Historie d' Asia  A rare  French  Book  mentions these particulars The Book I never met with but am apt to think that since they only have the Notion it was one of their own Countrymen who found the  ruinated Wall  and added the three  Tombs  I have so lately spoke of  YET 'tis a certainty beyond dispute that  Englishmen  have landed  there  at least one Countryman of ours has left behind him a convincing Argu∣ment of his Arrival in those Parts for underneath the Marble Flat which covers  Hector  's Tomb we found these Lines upon the side of a smooth Stone they seem'd to have been carv'd with difficulty by a Knife and spoke their Author a Salt Water Poet  A piece of Po∣etry made at  Troy  by an  En∣glish  Sailor in the Year  I do suppose that here stood  Troy  My Name it is  William  a jolly Boy  My other Name it is  Hudson  and so  God Bless the  Sailors  where ever they do go  I was here in the Year of our Lord and was  Bound to  Old England  God Bless her  WE staid  some Hours  with a wonderful delight and gaz'd about the Country with a satisfaction equal to our Curiosity but finding nothing more to entertain our Observation we began to think of getting back and so return'd the way we came we were not well on board before the Wind came fair and we set Sail immediately  The Island of  Tenedos  WE pass'd by  Tenedos  an Island celebrated for having hid the  Graecian  Navy from the  Trojan  View while they believing the Besiegers gone took in the Horse which enter'd  big with their Destruction  The Place is now not worth a Strangers notice but upon account of the abovenam'd Story Few Inhabitants are found upon it and those few the worst and meanest of the Countries thereabouts so strangely subject is the Fate of Nations to the common Changes and Uncertainties of frail Mortality  CHAP XXVII Of the Islands in the  Aegean  Sea  The Islands of  the Archipelago  famous anci∣ently  THE many Great and Little Islands which compose the  Archipe∣lago  have been at least most of them so extreamly famous for peculiar Attributes appropriated to 'em in the memorable Works of ancient  Poets  that I cannot pass 'em by without a transient View of such as most deserve our mention some there are so ve∣ry small as never yet to have been honour'd with a Name and many of the largest being sometimes seen and sometimes not in Sailing from  Constan∣tinople  to the Coast of  Egypt  I will only speak of such as Mariners ob∣lig'd sometimes to shift their Course by adverse Weather may by  Choice  or  Force  go nigh to touch at  The Names of the most con∣siderable  AND those are  Lemnos Chios Metelyn  and  Samos Icaria Patmos Zea Rhodes  and  Coos  sometimes a Ship is driven more  Westerly  and Sails by  Delos  pretty near the Continent sees  Thebes  and  Delphos Athens Corinth  and the famous  Creto  now  Candy  every one of these abovenam'd Places I will therefore treat of that the Reader may conceive a just Idea of the wondrous difference between their  Modern  and their  Ancient Circumstances  How it came to be call'd the  Aegean  Sea  BUT e'er I come to the particular Description of these several Places 'twill not be a miss to speak a Word or two in Explanation of the Sea in ge∣neral call'd  Aegean  from  Aegeus  Father to the famous  Theseus  who leap'd headlong thereinto believing that the Ship which brought his Son from Fighting with the  Monster Minotaurus  was return'd with the account of his Miscarriage the abovenam'd  Theseus  having fail'd in his Promise of conver∣ting his black Sails into white if he came back Victorious  Its Extent  IT is a Part or Arm and that the largest of the  Mediterranean  it reaches to the Entrance of the very  Hellespont  dividing  Greece  from  Asia Minor    'tis a dangerous Place to  Sail in  but especially by Night the  Islands  lying so extreamly close that oftentimes a Ship is driven forcibly upon a Rocky Shore in open Day by Stress of Weather  Lemnos  and its Product  Ter∣ra Sigillata  NOW let us visit  Lemnos  a considerable  Island  not so much for its extent of magnitude as the unthought Advantages accruing to the  Turks  it's present Masters from the yearly Exportation of a valuable Earth call'd  Terra Sigillata  from the small Impression of a Seal which marks the Balls wherein 'tis sold with  Turkish  Characters and so prevents the danger of an Imposition on the Merchant  IT was in ancient Times esteem'd of weighty Virtue in Medicinal Performances and gather'd Yearly by the Priests of  Venus  with a thousand Ceremonies and often mingled with the Blood of Goats in order to be of∣fer'd as a Sacrifice to that imaginary Goddess  LEMNOS  was formerly of no small Note for being taken notice of by  Homer  as the Place whereon the  Limping Vulcan  fell when  Jupiter  thought fit to kick him out of Heaven  Hom Iliad    When once I dar'd oppose my Brother  Jove  And Warr'd against him in the Realms above  He snatch'd me by the  Foot  then rais'd me high  And hurl'd me headlong from the  Starry Sky    Downward all Day I tumbled and begun  To draw near Earth at setting of the  Sun  On  Lemnos  then I fell  Chios  and its Etymology  NEXT  Chios  claims our Observation anciently receiving that Deno∣mination from the  Greek  Word  signifying  Snow  because her Moun∣tains frequently are cover'd with it now her Name is chang'd to  Zio  or as some pronounce it  Sio  'Tis near an hundred thirty odd Miles in com∣pass lengthning from the  Southward  to the  Northern Point  and subject to the  Turks  who notwithstanding suffer many  Greeks  to live among them with far greater  Privileges  than they give to any of their  Countrymen  in o∣ther Places  A description of the City and Inhabi∣tants  THE Town of  Sio  is considerably large and made convenient by a spacious Haven the City is defended by a Castle of no little Strength up∣on a Hill exceeding steep The Buildings of the Town are very Neat especially the Publick Ones and the Inhabitants I mean the  Greeks  so ve∣ry merry in their easy Slavery that all night long a Stranger is diverted with their Songs and Dances and their Instruments of Musick sounding briskly thro' the Streets The Women as esteem'd of old are yet the Mistresses of admirable Beauties fram'd by Nature for an amorous Con∣versation and possessing sweetly the politest Marks of gentle Affability They frequently appoint a kind of  Balls  and  Merrymakings  which are gi∣ven alternately from House to House and spend their Days in all the  Gayety  of Wealth and Liberty  The Manu∣factures of the Island  THE Product of the Island is the finest Corn and Oyl some Silks and Cotton and the best Sherbets which can be made by reason of the Excel∣lence of a rich kind of  Honey  found in  Mastick Trees  I call them so because  the Gum of that Name is in great abundance brought from thence and is a Distillation from the  Rind  which being cut in  August  still continues to emit great Quantities thereof till the beginning of  October  following  An old Tra∣dition  They have an  Old Traditional Account  that when  Saint Theodore  was led to  Mar∣tyrdom  he wept extreamly for the Blindness of the World and every Place which then was moisten'd by a  Tear  of his now bears the Tree affording  Mastick  tho' the  Tour  he took must have been very large for all the  South Part  of the  Island  bears them in great abundance  ARVIS  or  Amista  a large Mountain in the middle of the Country still abounds in that rich  Wine  so Celebrated formerly by  Virgil  in his  Eclogues  then call'd  Arvisian  now  Il vino Amistano  an  Italian Appel∣lation  Virg  Ecl  Et multo in primis hilarans convivia Baccho  Ante focum si frigus erit si messis in umbrâ  Vina Novum fundam calathis  Arvisia  Nectar  When elevated with a lofty Joy  Our Hours in  Bacchu's  Pleasures we employ  If Cold  by the kind Warmth of some bright Fire  Or  if 'tis Hot  to shady Bow'rs retire  Then with  gay Mirth  will we recruit our Souls  And with  Arvisian Nectar  crown the  Bowls  AND indeed the present Owners of the  Wine  agree with  Virgil  in the same Opinion  Chios  challen∣ges the Birth of  Homer  AMONG the many Things for which the  Island Chios  is remarkable she claims the Honour due to  Homer's Birth Place  challenging a right to that Pretention from a thousand several Circumstances and showing Travellers an ancient Monument which they would fain perswade us to believe was  Homer's Tomb  they either are mistaken in their Claim or the old  Distich  on that Subject shou'd have mention'd  Chios  in the room of  Iös  and have made the Verses run as follow  The seven contending Cities for him  IT wou'd be easy to Translate the Lines verbatim and inform the un∣learn'd Reader that the  Towns  contending for his Birth were  Smyrna Iös Rhodes Salamin Athens Argos  and  Colophon  but I have met with an admirable Thought in some  late English Poets Writings  tho' I cannot say directly who he was and rather chuse to quote his Words since they not only touch upon the present Subject but will represent a very true and lively Image of the little Honour Writers get till past enjoying it  Seven  Wealthy Towns contend for  Homer Dead  Thro' which the  Living Homer  beg'd his Bread  Mitylen  or  Lesbos  both those Names how given  LESBOS  or  Mitylen  another Island next appears considerable in her Magnitude near two hundred Miles in Circuit not far distant from the  Phrygian Continent  a very healthful Country of a temperate Air and Soil Productive of the finest Corn in  Christendom  The Island takes its Name of  Lesbos  from the Adventurer  Lesbus  Son of old  Sapithus  who was sent by the directions of the  Oracle Mitylen  from  Mitylene  the Sister to  Methymna  Daughter of  Macarius  and the Wife of the abovenam'd  Lesbus  The Town of  Mitylen  THE City  Mitylen  upon a small  Peninsula  the Capital of all the Island likewise claims from hence her Etymology Her Buildings are magnifi∣cently fine and beautiful her Situation high and stately and the brisk In∣habitants of this delightful Country gay and honest in their Poverty like those of  Chios  and like them now subject to the  Turkish  Government which here maintains a constant Fleet of well appointed Gallies to secure the Islands thereabouts belonging to the  Sultan  from the daring Squadrons of the bold  Maltese  or  Florentine  Adventurers  The Vertue of the  Lesbian  Wines  THE Wine of  Lesbos  is at present look'd upon exceeding good and boasting one convenient Property beyond most other sorts for let a Man Debauch as much as possible with an Excess thereof it never hurts him nor is troubled with those heady  Qualities  which  Graecian Wines  are gene∣rally subject to  IF you'll allow the Tast of  Horace  to have been polite and he methinks shou'd know its Relish who so admirably well describes its  Vertues  you may see his Thoughts upon the matter  Hor L    Ode    Hic innocentis pocula Lesbii  Duces sub umbra Nec Semeleius  Cum marte confundet Thyoneus  Praelia  Here under some thick Shade  By meeting Branches made  Shall you while no Sun Beams upon you shine  Drink Cups of harmless  Lesbian  Wine  Nor shall  Thyonian Bacchus  tempt your Rage  To rise to Disoord or with  Mars  engage  Spirits or frightful Ap∣paritions on the Coasts  THEY have a Notion that in some few Harbours of this Island frightful  Apparitions  flutter dreadfully about a Ship all Night that dismal Shrieks are often heard and I have been inform'd by many that they cou'd not Sleep without the trouble of the most tremenduous and amazing Dreams imaginable This last Assertion is a certain Truth but I am rather apt to think the matter an effect of the unwholsome Vapours rising from the Sea or Lakes about it near those Harbours  The Island  Samos  AND now we come to  Samos  not considerable in its self but on Ac∣count of a Commodity  thence  brought in very large and frequent Quan∣tities  A Dangerous Tempest forc'd  our Ship  to seek a  Shelter  in a certain  Creek  upon the  Southward  of this  Island  where we Anchor'd pretty safely and were drawn by the delightful Prospect of the  Shore  to  Land  upon it  about Six in Company  A pleasant Accident  WE left the Boat which brought us from the Ship within a little  Nook  or  Bay  nigh  Land lock'd  by the  High  and  Rocky Ground  about it and were Walking on the Shore in order to ascend the Country when we Spy'd upon the  Waterside  a thing which at a distance look'd not much unlike a  WashingTub  WE Walk'd directly to it and perceiv'd it was a  Vessel  of a very small and Incapacious Hollow full of  Oyl  in which were Swimming up and down near Twenty little  Engines  which upon Examination we discover'd to be  Sponges  each containing upon either side a little piece of  Cork  which being  fastned to the middle kept the  Sponge  it self afloat and only suffer'd half to move in or imbibe the  Oyl  within the  Vessel  WE were Busied a considerable time in looking on these things and wondring what shou'd be their use in so remote a Place from any  Town  as that appear'd whereon we found 'em but at last resolv'd to sit us down upon the  Sand  and wait the coming of an owner to the  Vessel  for we thought it Probable there was one and believ'd he cou'd not long be absent  BUT while we Talk'd to one another of the Wondrous Smoothness of the Waters in the  Bay  while those without were Ruffled by the Storm and cast our Eyes upon their stillness  A Strange sur∣prize  we were all surpriz'd to see a thing not much unlike a  Basket  pop with force above the  Surface  and continue Moving up and down a little Space then up there started something like a Man who shook his Head rub'd clear his Eyes and Swam directly in∣wards to the Place we sate on pushing in the  Basket  just before him  THIS Second Figure really startled us beyond the First and brought to our remembrance an  Idea  of the  Sea God Neptune  for we hardly cou'd believe him  Mortal  who had risen from the Water by whose side we had been sitting nigh ten Minutes  THE Man for such he prov'd to be no sooner saw us but he seem'd a little Shy of Landing till we beckon'd him and call'd as kindly as we could and so perswaded him to come ashore and bring the  Basket  with him He had left his Cloathes and other things behind the  Rock  not ten Yards from us and immediately ran thither for them  A Diving  Bas∣ket  in the mean time we approach'd his  Basket  found it quite bound round with  Cork  and co∣ver'd with a  Canvass  in the midst whereof appear'd a Slit thro which we put our hands and drew out  Sponges  of a surprizing Bigness  THE Man return'd as soon as dress'd and finding us more civil than he had expected told us in a kind of  Lingua Franca  that those  Sponges  grew on  Rocks  Ten Fifteen sometimes Twenty Fathom deep that there were many Hundred  Divers  in the  Island  some of whom had left him just before who got their  Livelyhoods  like him by gathering  Sponges  A curious Di∣ving project  THEN he shew'd us how they were enabled to perform it in the following manner Half the  Sponge  as I have said is soak'd in  Oyl  the other half is dip'd before in certain  Stiptic Waters  to prevent the  Oyl  from Penetrating farther than it ought to go when so prepar'd they take the  Sponge  and thrusting it within their Mouths the  Oyl'd  part outward but of that almost an Inch within the Lips they press their Teeth a little hard upon it and by that means force the  Oyly Sponge  to close the En∣trance of their Mouths against the  Water  How the Sponges are gather'd  THUS they  Dive  and with a little difficulty in a  Streighten'd Suction  make a Shift to tarry under  Water  a considerable time They sink the  Bas∣kets  by the help of  Stones  which they contrive to fasten at the  Bottom  and with  Instruments  they carry down on purpose cut the  Sponges  from the sides of  Rocks  till having fill'd the  Baskets  they take off the Weights and then they rise with ease by reason of the  Cork  about them  How long they tarry un∣der Water  BY constant Practice many of these  Divers  are arriv'd at such Perfecti∣on in the Art that they can tarry under Water till the Oyl corrupts which it will always do in less than two hours time There is a Law among the  Divers  of this Island that no Man shall be allow'd to Marry till he can  demonstrate by a Tryal he is qualify'd to Dive for one continued quarter of an Hour The Novelty engag'd us all to make experiment and I who more than most Men was averse to  Diving  did without great difficulty keep my Head two Minutes under Water But the Secret of the  Stiptic Preparation  he refus'd to teach us tho' we wou'd have gladly brib'd him to it  SAMOS  boasts no other Trade than this of  Sponges  which is yet so profitable that they Yearly send away vast Ship Loads of them and grow Rich thereby beyond the Emulation of their less Industrious or less Skill∣ful Neighbours  Why  Juno  is said to have been born at  Samos  THE constant clearness of the Air in  Samos  gave occasion to the  Poets  of Antiquity to feign that  Juno  taken allegorically for that Element was Born upon this Island and the excellent  Pythagoras  adorn'd the Country with the Honour due to the respected  Birthplace  of so Great a Man They also still pretend to shew the  Rock  whence  Aesop  was thrown headlong and a  Cave  where in the Reign of  Numa Pompilius Heriphile  a Sibyl prophesy'd of Christ  Description of the Island  Icaria  ICARIA  now  Niceria  is a small and inconsiderable Island Creeks it has but no commodious Haven bearing Corn in great abundance but possessing very few Inhabitants and famous for the  Fornoli  a ridge of sharp and dangerous Rocks much fear'd by Sailors in a Foggy Night It's ancient Name the Poets feign'd to have been given it together with the Sea it lies in from the fictious Fall of  Icarus  attempting to have flown with artificial Wings of which thus  Ovid  in his  Metamorphoses  Ovid Met    Oraque caeruleâ patrium clamantia nomen  Excipiuntur aquâ quae nomen traxit ab illo  He fell and on his Father call'd in vain  For as he sunk in the relentless Main  Skycolour'd Waters stop'd his eager Breath  And took the Name they bear from his untimely Death  AND in another Place  Icarus Icariis nomina fecit Aquis  Th'  Icarian Sea  from  Icarus  took Name  THAT the Island took its Name from the same Accident appears from  Daedalus  's burying his Son upon it thus describ'd by the same Poet in the Book abovenam'd  Devovitque suas artes corpusque Sepulcro  Condidit tellus à nomine dicta sepulti  He curs'd those Arts which drew his Ruin on  And built a Tomb upon his breathless Son  From whose unhappy Fate well known to Fame  The Ground wherein he lay receiv'd its Name  Description of the Island  Patmos  PATMOS  is an Island very small and full of Rocks extreamly Bar∣ren not affording even the common Necessaries for support of human Life which therefore the Inhabitants supply themselves withall from other Islands of the  Archipelago  The Land is Mountainous and has no more  than one small City which Equips a Fleet of Trading Vessels to Import Conveniencies from Foreign Parts the ancient Name is chang'd at present to  Palmosa  THIS Place is famous for the Character it has of being the Seat St  John  made Choice of while he Pen'd his  Revelations    A Monastery on a Hill  and upon a Moun∣tain in the  Northern  Parts there stands a Monastery of the  Graecian Coloie∣ro's  who profess that Saint their Patron and pretend to shew some Reliques to inquiring Travellers  THE Notice which I had hereof oblig'd me to the hopes of seeing  Patmos  and a Tempest was so favourable to my Wishes that we anchor'd in a Haven not far distant from the Monastery and the Opportunity invi∣ting me a Shore I landed with design to Walk and Visit it  THE  Northern  side of  Patmos  is but very thinly Peopled and as I was destitute thereby of any means to get a  Guide  so either want of Curiosity or Indisposition by the roughness of the Storm disswaded those on board our Vessel from consenting to go with me  The Author lands at  Pat∣mos  HOWEVER since the Road appear'd but short and seemingly conspicuous I resolv'd to undertake the Visit single so I landed with a pair of Pistols and a Scymetar and cross'd a little kind of Plain which brought me to the bottom of a Hill on which the Monastery had its Situ∣ation  THE Hill was overgrown with a large Wood thro' which appear'd no other Passage than a small Foot Path and that not beaten but a very unfrequented way which led me thro' an hundred several turnings to As∣cents extreamly steep and intricate as Labyrinths  Loses his way in a Wood  I came at last where I perceiv'd the Wood grow thinner and cou'd see a pretty way before me there I stop'd and looking up discover'd on the Brow of an impending Precipice a little Hut or Cave which seem'd the Habitation of some melancholy  Hermit  or unhappy Lover like the Swains of ancient Times who being baffled in their Hopes forsook the World for some forlorn and solitary Wilderness to spend the remnant of their silent Days in Grief for their Misfortunes  Discovers a Cave  SURPRIZ'D at first by the Romantic Air of this low Cave I stood a while to think if it were safe to venture forward since it was a probable belief that some wild Beast had chose that Den for the rough Scene of his Retirement but that groundless Apprehension vanish'd instantly for while I yet continued in suspense methoughts I cou'd discover plainly something like a Door that stood a jarr and consequently rendred it a Place improper for a Salvage Mansion  I advanc'd with equal Doubt and Curiosity till having gain'd the summit of the Precipice I found it was a Cell the Door of which stood half way open and contain'd upon its smooth outside a piece of course and halflost Painting with the following  Latin  Sentence in a homely Cha∣racter  With an In∣scription on the Door  Hic in Coelo Quies  Here  and in  Heaven  is  Rest  THE softness of this first Discovery invited me to make a Step beyond it so that with a gentle Force I push'd the Door quite open and was all amaz'd when I perceiv'd the inside of the Cell as still as Possible no Or∣nament appear'd to set it off but just against the Entrance burnt a Lamp on either side a little Altar and the weak and broken Light which they afforded faintly striking thro' the dullness of the Place  Finds a Man in a black Coffin  discover'd in the midst a large black Coffin fill'd with something not to be distinguish'd but as black and dismal in its first appearance as the Coffin it was laid in  NOTHING I then thought cou'd add to my surprize which yet was doubled when there rose with a deliberate Silence from within the Coffin something like a Man or rather Spirit who no sooner sate up∣right than looking on me with a frightful Aspect he pronounc'd these Words in a low Voice  Who invites him into the Place  Che sei se un Christiano benvenuto  Who are you If a  Christian  you are welcome  BY the Language of his Salutation I perceiv'd him an  Italian  and the trembling of his Limbs perswaded me to think that the appearance of my Scymetar and Pistols had as much surpriz'd him as he had me I there∣fore took immediate care to undeceive him in the apprehension he had fram'd that I was some arm'd Robber and inform'd him that I was a  Briton  Travelling the World and thrown by Chance upon that Island where I landed with design to Visit the  Greek  Monastery  THE old Man seem'd transported with the News made shift to rise and led me to a Seat hewn roughly from the Rock within the Cell he laid his Hands upon my Head pronounc'd a grave and honest Blessing and proceeded modestly to take the liberty of asking some few Questions which I willingly oblig'd him with as ready Answers to  Which proves to be a Her∣mits Cell  HE then abandon'd all the Coyness of his first deportment and inform'd me he had liv'd a Hermit's Life in that poor Cell nigh two and thirty Years together that he frequently was visited by the Fryars of the Mona∣stery not far distant that they sometimes brought him Meat and Wine which he consented  now and then  to take for the support of Nature tho' he rather chose to live on Roots and clear Spring Water that he always Slept in that black Coffin never to be absent from a strong  Memento  of his frail Mortality that he was born I think at  Zant  and nam'd  Antonio Giacomo Malaviso  A Chappel in the Wood  I purposely omit some Hours Discourse I had with this old Hermit because digressive from the Cause for which I mention him and only will inform my Reader that he wou'd accompany me to a small Chappel in the Wood at no great distance from his Cell built over the Stone Cave wherein St  John  is said to have resided while he Writ his famous Book of  Revelations  HE left me there first recommending me to the Civilities of certain Priests who kept the Chappel They receiv'd and treated me with won∣derful Respect and having talk'd away an Hour in Questioning each other as we thought convenient they proceeded to unlock a private Door which open'd from a corner of the Chappel to a very dark and nar∣row Passage  The Cave wherein St  John  is said to have Writt his Revelati∣ons  WE Descended some few steps and having Walk'd about six paces far∣ther came upon a sudden to a very large and lightsome Cave the Light was introduc'd by very Artificial Hollows from the Surface through the Rock and in the midst of one of the Four Squares which form'd the Cell was cut a Seat exactly like the  Niches  made for Statues in  Cathe∣dral Churches  JUST before this  Niche  there stands a solid Rocky Table of about a yard Square and here they wou'd perswade us to beleive the  Saint  was seated at his daily Studies  Reliques in the Cave  To confirm me in belief of this Opinion they made long Harangues of those Authentic proofs which justified Tradition and desir'd that I would take particular and serious Notice of a kind of round Impression on the  Area  or  Superficies  of the Table which they say was caus'd by the Perpetual standing of the Brazen Vessel which contain'd his Ink and on the Floor they show'd me several little Marks like Spots of  Black  which they assur'd me were the Drops occasion'd by the Shaking of the Pen where∣with the  Saint  was us'd to Write the Dictates of his holy Inspiration  The Monaste∣ry of  St John  WITH these obliging Priests I visited the  Monastery  and was there receiv'd as civilly as I coud possibly have found an Entertainment in the House of an Acquaintance or Relation every thing was Neat and Plen∣tiful without Extravagance becoming the Decorum of Religious Livers yet not void of Relish Form or Delicacy  A Miracle of  St John  's Hand  AMONG the many Reliques they delight to boast of and com∣municate to Travellers they shew'd me a large bony Hand which seem'd to be a Mans Cut off not far above the Wrist the Bones were dry and full of little Holes as if Wormeaten yet there seem'd to sprout at all the Fingers Ends a little sign of something which the  Fryars  told us were the Nails of the latenam'd  St John  HOW they came by  St John  's Right Hand they cou'd not tell me but attested that on every Second Sunday of the Month the Nails were Cut as close as possible and that they always grew again They brought me a large Silver Box wherein the  Parings  of these Nails were safely kept as sacred Reliques never to be us'd  The Virtue of his Nails  but when some Father of their order was ex∣treamly Sick and then they said a few of those thrown piously upon a Fire and the Smoke thereof ascending at his Nostrils are a very quick and neverfailing Remedy provided the Sick Man's appointed Hour of Death prevents not his Recovery  Description of the Island  Zea  FROM  Patmos  let us look on  Zea  a small Island of about Twelve Miles in Compass Hilly and extreamly full of Woods productive of a large and fat'ning Acorn of such noted goodness and of such abundance in this Island that the few Inhabitants upon it who are generally  Greeks  but subject to the  Turks Authority  enrich themselves considerably by ex∣porting Yearly great Shiploads to other Islands and some Places on the Continent  Asses excel∣lent at Climb∣ing  BUT what is most worth Notice here is the prodigious Usefullness of certain  Asses  which the Natives Saddle and upon their Backs so well do those poor Creatures Climb can Travel over Rocks and Craggy Pre∣cipices so extremely Steep and Rugged that a Man on Foot wou'd find himself put to it to ascend without Assistance  THE Island boasts one little Town but that entirely void of stately Buildings or indeed the Poorest Ornaments of common decency for not a Door in all the Place is Four Foot High but People almost Creep who  are oblig'd to enter them and this they do because the  Turks  who often come to buy or plunder Asses in this Island wou'd if possible make Stables of their very Houses  A description of the Island  Rhodes  RHODES  is an Island famous now as it has ever been for all the Bles∣sings liberal Nature can bestow upon a Country in ancient Times her va∣liant People were the Envy but withall the Wonder of their Neighbours Skill'd in every  Science Grace  and  Vertue  the temperate Air convenient Harbours fertil Pastures and unnumber'd Benefits she justly boasted of were admirable and peculiar and the Sun so constantly was known to shine upon this Country that  Clara Rhodia Rhodes the Bright  distinguish'd her among the Ancients for that glorious Blessing  Famous for two Things  TWO things of old she was particularly famous for  The first Disco∣very and Planting of the Vine  and that  stupendious Fabrick  the  Colossus  stri∣ding on the Sea from Rock to Rock that Ships might Sail with ease be∣tween the Legs and when thrown down the very Brass whereof 'twas form'd was found enough to load almost a thousand  Camels  ABOUT the Year of Christ  Emanuel Emperor of

and Rivolets abounding greatly with a noble  Wine  fine  Cypress Trees  and  Tur∣pentine  with many rich and usefull  Druggs  exported thence to almost e∣very part of  Christendom  But what this Island is most famous for is that it was the  Birthplace  of the great  Hippocrates  that Sacred  DemyGod  of  Physick  and Improver of a  Science  so extreamly Usefull to  Mankind in general  Description of  Delos  DELOS  now call'd  Diles  is an Island all encompass'd by a Ring of Rocks and lies conveniently directly in the Passage between  Greece  and  Asia  'Twas famous anciently for the Great  Oracle  and  Temple  of  Apollo  and receiv'd its Name of  From  signifying Clear  Delos  from the clear and pertinent  Responses Querists  met with to their  Questions  of all kinds whatsoever hence  Apollo  oftentimes was Worship'd by the Name of  Delius  The Ruins of  Apollo  's Tem∣ple  THE Island now is  Ʋninhabited  but well deserves a Strangers View for there remain the  Ruins  of  Apollo's Temple  still Majestical and full of Grandeur many stately Marble Pillars lie neglected in the Heaps of Rub∣bish and a very precious kind of Stone is sometimes brought away to ma∣ny Parts of  Italy  UPON the Death of  Christ  the  Oracles  grew silent and from thenceforth  Delos  lost her Honour and has never been frequented since that time We read in  Plutarch  a remarkable Relation of an Ac∣cident which happen'd to the Knowledge of one  Epitherses  who was for∣merly his  Tutor  in the Reign of  Tiberius Emperor of Rome  the Story is as follows  A Story from  Plutarch  BETWEEN  Corcyra  and  Leucadia  lay the  Paxe  two small Islands' where this  Epitherses  Sailing for the Coast of  Italy  was suddenly becalm'd and while the  Passengers  uneasy at the slowness of their Voyage walk'd upon the  Deck  a  frightful shrill  and  mournful Voice  alarm'd 'em from the Shore distinctly calling  Thamus Thamus Thamus  A Voice from an unknown Shore  THAMƲS  was a  Pylot  then upon the Poop one born in  Egypt  who was silent with amazement till the  Call  was thrice aloud repeated then he answer'd faintly and demanded why he summon'd him The  Voice  re∣ply'd As soon as thou art come to the  Palodes  let it be Proclaim'd aloud that  Pan  Great  Pan  is Dead  A sudden Horror seiz'd the Company to hear this strange and unexpected Salutation presently the Wind came fair and as the Ship drew near the Place abovenam'd  Thamus  as he was desir'd stood high upon the Poop and with an elevated Voice cry'd  Pan is Dead  when in a Moment all the Air was torn with Groanings and a mix'd Confusion of  complaining Ac∣cents  so extreamly dismal that it cannot be imagin'd  CAESAR  hearing this  Report  commanded  Thamus  to be brought be∣fore him who attested it with the concurring Evidences of the  Sailors  then on board  The Cessation of Oracles  Great  Pan  was  Christ  the Universal  Shepherd  and his Death had bound the  Devil's Power  no longer suff'ring his delusive  Oracles  to impose upon Mankind they therefore upon hearing this unwel∣come News bewail'd their Miseries with the abovenam'd Lamentati∣ons  SOMETIMES it happens that you Sail along the  Continent  and see the ancient venerable  Thebes  renown'd of old for admirable Vertues Skill'd politely in all Arts and Sciences Mistress of the Rules of War and Policy a Government made famous by the wonderfull Successes of a Race of  Heroes  but particularly Glorious in the never dying Memory of Brave  Epaminondas  who was yet ungratefully Rewarded for his Matchless Acti∣ons and neglected rather than encourag'd by the Factions of his Country a very ancient Vice and still I fear too fashionable in the Modern World I wish it were not in my Power to quote Examples  Thebes  as She now is  THEBES  is now entirely subject to the  Turkish Government  and groans beneath a weighty Burthen of  Oppressive Tyranny  some stately  Ruins  of  Antiquity  may still be seen and feast the Eye with wonderful De∣light while with a melancholy  Contemplation  of the short continuance of vain  Magnificence  they entertain the  Ʋnderstanding  Delphos  as at present  DELPHOS  memorably noted for a thousand Causes humbly rears her  miserable Head  as if rememb'ring former Splendour she reflected mournfully upon her present  Fall  and blush'd to be discover'd in her  chang'd Condition  The  Mountain of Parnassus  now no more pretends to boast the  Muses Residence  the lofty  Songs  of ancient  Poets  are forgotten on the nowneg∣lected Streams of  Helicon  and the delightfull  Harmonies  once celebrated there are now converted into  Howlings  of strange Salvage Beasts and  Bray∣ings  of  Wild Asses  Athens  de∣scrib'd  ATHENS  still may call her self a  City  but can only do it as the  Ske∣leton  of some  Dead Man  continues long to represent the Shape of  human Bo∣dy  for her ancient  Temples  are defac'd and buryed even beyond the Knowledge of the  very Ground  they stood upon her exemplary Forms of  Government  and  Order  ruin'd and demolish'd by the arrogance of  Infidels  more arbitrary and unjust than all the Tyrants she oppos'd in former Ages No longer now do the judicious Laws of the incomparable  Solon  sway her Natives Bribery prevails and  Justice  yields her Balance to the  Rapine  of an  uncontroul'd  and  barbarous  Authority  BUT notwithstanding the Destruction of her valuable  Liberty  she still retains her ancient  Plenty  constantly affording all the  Delicacies  require to be obtain'd by even such as wou'd encourage  Pride  and pamper  Luxury  Corinth  and her Product  CORINTH  situated on that narrow  Neck of Land  which joins  Moreae  to the  undivided Continent  is only famous for her  Mines of Brass  in great esteem among the  Romans  and affording still the finest  Metal  in the  World  but that in small and inconsiderable Quantities  Description of  Crete  or  Candy  CRETE  or  Candy  as at present call'd was taken by the  Turks  from the Possession of the brave  Venetians  who defended it some Years against a  constant Siege  and made the Place a  bloody Purchase  to the  Turkish Army  It is an Island very  large  its  Capital  containing stately Houses and defended by a  regular  and  modern Work  of admirable  Strength  and  Artifice  Provisions  here  are very Plentiful and the  Inhabitants  exceeding Numerous many  Har∣bours  of commodious form and a capacious magnitude invite the  Traffick  of the  Foreign Merchant  and it is observable that  Crete  is blest with a surpri∣zing Property which some have thought  peculiar  to the  Soil of Ireland  for nothing  poysonous  is  bred therein  nor can the  Reptiles  of another Country long survive their  Importation  thither  Very subject to  Thunder  'TWAS in this Island  Jupiter  was born and thinking when I saw the Place upon the fiction of the  Poets  I observ'd with Pleasure that the Judgment of the  Ancients  still mov'd regularly for nothing cou'd have been more natural than representing  Jove  a  Native  of  this Island  since there hard∣ly passes  one whole Day  throughout the  Year  wherein it does not  Thunder  with a mighty  Violence  CHAP XXVIII Of  Alexandria  in  Egypt  The Origin of  Alexandria  NOW have I brought you into  Egypt  at the common  Landing Place  the ancient  Alexandria  so call'd from the successful  Mace∣donian  who desirous to perpetuate his Memory there resolv'd to build a City which he did upon or near the Place where now the  Modern Alexandria  has its Situation  Its ancient State  HE Peopled it with  Greeks  and so amazingly adorn'd the  Streets  and  Houses  with the richest Gifts of Art and Nature that 'twas long the cele∣brated  Paradise  of all the  East  The Houses were supported upon  Marble Pillars  and as much of them were hid belowground as appear'd above Unnumbred  Statues  of the nicest Workmanship adorn'd the Place and every stately  Ornament  was purchas'd to compleat its Excellence  How different from the Pre∣sent  BUT oh How different from this does she appear at present The Houses which remain are low all meanly built and thinly Peopled those excepted which are situated on the Haven The form is almost square en∣compass'd round by double Walls with many Turrets in the ancient way These Walls are commonly believ'd the same which  Ptolemy  so ma∣ny Ages since commanded to be built for the Security of the thenvaluable City  Its Situation  TIS seated in a very Barren Desart Country and has no Allurement Trade excepted to invite Inhabitants  The Castle of  Alexandria  Upon the Entrance of the Ha∣ven formerly the Island  Pharus  now converted into Continent so great a Change does  Time  produce in all weak sublunary Beings stands a Castle ill supplied with Water or Conveniencies for long Defence The Ordnance of the Walls salute all Ships upon their coming to an Anchor for the Port of  Alexandria  is free for Traders of all Nations whatsoever  THIS  Pharus  which is now a part of the Main Continent was not only divided from it in Times past but if we may believe the Affir∣mation of old  Homer  was an Island situated at considerable distance  Hom  Odys  L    'Midst stormy Seas there does an Island stand  Which Men call  Pharus  before  Egypt's Land    So far disjoin'd that when the brisk Winds play  On a Ships Poop the speedy Vessel may  With swelling Sails get thither in a Day  THE Face of Nature has been strangely alter'd since the Days of  Homer  and the only Reason Men can give for this Effect is that it has been caus'd  by gradual discharges of the Sand brought down by  Nilus  in his An∣nual Overflows and so thrown up in heaps between the Island and the Continent till in the course of time the Sea was banish'd and the whole became firm Land as it remains at present  The Ancient  Pharus  or  Egyptian LightHouse  ONCE the  Pharus  had a Bridge built from it to the Shore of  Egypt  and upon a very steep and rugged Promontory of the Island stood the  Tower  on which the Mighty  Philadelphus  Built his  Lighthouse  which obtain'd the Honour to be Rank'd among the  Worlds Seven Wonders  it took its Name of  Pharos  from the Place it stood in and has given that old Denomination to all those Buildings which are rais'd to hang out Lights for the Directi∣on of such Ships as else would Labour in a dangerous Darkness  The Lake of  Maroeotis  THERE is a Place now call'd  Buchatra  anciently the Lake of  Ma∣roeotis  Famous for its Depth and even incredible Extent which took in Water at the Yearly Overflow and by the means of Sluyces of amazing Fabrick kept it in the whole Year round supplying numerous Canals of Artificial Length and Breadth beyond belief on which the old  Egyptians  Mad with Luxury continually delighted to Sail up and down in Stately Barges Gilt and Painted full of amorous Men and Women Brisk in Wantonness and Sounding Musick as their Oars divided the complaining Waters Singing and enjoying all the loose and airy Pleasures of a  Ju∣venile Extravagance  BUT those Canals are now at least the greatest part Dried up and lost by everrolling heaps of Sand  A Gloomy Labyrinth  the Lake however still remains but quite depriv'd of all appearances of that stupendious Building which con∣sisted of an intricate and Artfull Labyrinth that led by many Thousand Windings Dark and Dismal to the  Seven and Thirty Glorious Palaces  appointed for the Meeting of the  Seven and Thirty  Jurisdictive Powers of that formidable Country and at the End whereof we Read that there stood once a Stately Square and wonderfully vast Fine  Marble Pyramid  suppos'd to be the  Sepulchre  of  King Ismandes  the Original Contriver of the Lake and Labyrinth at least the Founder of the  Pyramid  THERE is not any thing in  Alexandria  worth the mentioning but some few venerable Reliques of Antiquity which still proclaim with silent Elo∣quence the onceaspiring and unrival'd Stateliness which Crown'd this City with a Dazling Majesty  The Tomb of  Alexander  the Great  AND First they show the Tomb of that brave Monarch  Alexander the Great  whose Body taken from  Perdiccas  by Ambitious  Ptolemy  was brought by him to  Egypt  where when he was kill'd by Soldiers in a Desart  Alexander  's Body was by them convey'd to  Alexandria  and lies entomb'd in a mean Chappel visited but rarely by some Curious Travel∣lers and held in great esteem by the  Mahometans  themselves who pay a twofold veneration to his Memory as a Mighty Warrior and a Holy Prophet for Tradition tells them he was  both  while Living  Joseph  's Gra∣naries  ANOTHER Rarity they shew most Strangers is a very Lofty Pile of Buildings all compos'd of solid Stone but ruin'd much by na∣tural decay containing many large Apartments strangely wild and void of Regularity some would perswade us to believe that these were  Joseph  's  Granaries  or Places which he order'd to be Built within the Seven Years of Plenty to preserve the Magazines of Corn against the fol∣lowing Years of Famine in those parts  Cleopatra  's Palace  UPON the rising of a Hill which overlooks the Haven stand the Ruins of a spacious and aspiring Structure probably the Palace of the fa∣mous  Cleopatra  whereof remain some Pillars yet entire and some few Ar∣ches of polite Contrivance They pretend to shew the Ruins of a private  Gallery  thro' which that Queen receiv'd  Mark Anthony  on his Return from the Defeat at  Actium  Pharaoh  's Needle  UPON the Place where  Alexander  's Palace stood of old remain two  Hieroglyphic Obelisks  of  Theban Marble  one quite fallen t'other standing of considerable height and vulgarly distinguish'd by the Name of  Pharaoh's Needle  UPON a little spot of rising Ground without the City Walls and on the  SouthWest side  there stands a  Column  of a Substance much like  Porphyry  in height near seventy Foot and five and twenty in circumference it stands upon a  Cube  or  Pedestal  far less in compass than the bottom of the  Pillar  THE Conquering  Caesar  here erected this fine  Column  as a memorable  Trophy  of his  Victory  over  Pompey  and left it to  Posterity  as an ambitious  Monument  of his successfull  Conduct  But to let Men see how vain are their Endeavours when oppos'd by  Heaven  he lost his aim and has instead of  Triumphing  o'er routed  Pompey  given the  Vanquish'd  all the Honour he  himself  aspir'd to gain from  future Ages  by the  Credit  of this  Victory    Pompey  's Pillar  for now the  Christians  know the  Column  by no other Name than  Pompey's Pil∣lar  so that many thousands hear  him  nam'd who never read or dreamt of such a Man as  Caesar  The Martyr∣dom of St  Mark  at  Alex∣andria  TRAJAN  was Emperor of  Rome  when they condemn'd St  Mark  to

its Extent Inhabitants and Forms of Government which tho' perhaps my Opportunities enabled me to do more fully than most former Writers yet it would require a length too tedious and digressive from my purpose to en∣large upon that Subject  How far the Author Treats of  Aethiopia  I only mean to speak so far of  Aethiopia  as the Country interferes with my Discourse upon the  Source  and  Channel  of the  River Nilus  as I have had occasion elsewhere in this Book to mention the Religion of the  Persians  Customs of the  Tartars  and some other points relating to such Countries as were widely distant from my purpose and were therefore Treated of no farther than they had dependance  on  or Interest  in  the  Turkish Empire  A Discourse of  Aethiopia  HOWEVER that vast Tract of Land distinguish'd  amongst Christians  by the Name of  Aethiopia  is not as is commonly beleiv'd commanded by the Arbitrary Nod of  one Great Monarch  whom we vulgarly call  Presler John  but by corruption of the Genuine Word which is no more than  PrissirJan  which in the Language of the Country signifies  Renown'd  or  Mighty Emperor  The Govern∣ment of  Aethiopia  TIS true he is Possessor of the  Greatest share  of  Honour  and  Authority  having more than Thirty  Tributary Princes  under his Command whose  Reigns  are  Limited  and  Power Created  by his undisputed will and Sove∣reign Pleasure but there are Monarchs wholly as Tyrannical and Absolute as  He Nine several Kings  possess vast Territories  free  and  independant  on each others Government and all these  Princes  so extreamly Jealous of their Neighbouring Equals and so carefull to preserve their own  Preroga∣tive  that they permit no  Traffick  'twixt their Subjects cautiously prevent∣ing with the strictest Prohibition all Communication whatsoever and condemning to  immediate Death  all Subjects of a  Foreign Prince  they find a∣mongst them  How divided in their Inte∣rests  AND as the  Int'rests  of these Princes are so widely separated so are their  Professions of Religion  and  Morality  Those under the Dominion of the late nam'd  Prissir Jan  are  Christians  or at least usurp that Title I say  usurp  because unfortifi'd by  Truth  or  Learning  they have grossly mingled sordid Remnants of their  old Idolatry  with the diviner Practices of  Christian Duty  THEY first receiv'd the  Faith of Christ  by the industrious Labours of the  Aethiopian Eunuch Philip's Convert  and retain a  Dusky  and  Traditional  Account of the uncertain Circumstances of that famous Action whereby they are misled to strange Opinions widely differing from each others Te∣nets but  alike mistaken  in the universal End they blindly aim at  And Religion  SOME prefer our  Saviour  as the greatest Person of the  Trinity  some esteem him  lowest of the Three  some believe not in the  Trinity  at all and many ignorantly Zealous in their Folly still prefer St  Philip  's Merits to the worth of our  Redeemer  Their Cha∣racter  THEY are a People generally speaking of a  Slothful Disposition Obstinate  and  Rash  extreamly swift to  Anger  and of daring  Courage  when provok'd by the temptation of a  strong Resentment  they are  Jealous  to ex∣cess and very  Avaritious Temperate  in  Diet  nor inclinable to  Drunkenness  they are  Tall  of  Stature Strong  in  Constitution  and  Robust  in their  Proporti∣on  and as I said before most resolute Defenders of their  valu'd Property  Why difficult to Travel there  IT is  perhaps  to their unreasonable  Hatred  of all kind of  Strangers  that the Civiliz'd Inhabitants of  Europe  owe their Ignorance of those  remote  and  dark'ned  Corners of the  distant World  for as they are prohibited by Princi∣ple to  entertain  or even preserve the Lives of curious Travellers it has been hitherto impossible to make Discoveries by the Endeavours of Adventurous Men  alone  or  amicable Parties  and the mighty distance they are at from  Christian Powers  the spacious Countries interposing their extensive Lands the  Mountains Lakes  and  Desarts  inaccessible to all Approaches were in e∣very Age and  still  continue formidable  Barriers  to the aim of  Curiosity  or efforts of  Ambition  The Princes who have been baffled in the Search of the head of  Nilus  IT is this alone that was enabled  many Ages since  to baffle the At∣tempts of Powerful Monarchs Men possess'd of every help which  Power  and  Riches  could afford their Resolution It is this alone that could have foil'd the oft repeated Efforts of  Egyptian Philadelphus  or the  Roman Nero  it is this alone that could have disappointed the resolv'd Attempts of Great  Cambyses  Fam'd  Sesostris  and the  Macedonian Alexander  All these Princes have at several times endeavour'd to no purpose an entire Discovery of that  Mysterious Sourse of Waters so conceal'd by Nature  that it seems to speak  our very Search unlawful  and  prohibited  thus nicely touch'd by  Lucan  Lucan    Arcanum Naturae caput non prodidit ulli  Nec licuit populis parvum te  Nile  videre  Amovit{que} sinus gentes maluit ortus  Mirari quam nôsse tuos  Nature O  Nile  forbids to look on  thee  Where thy  faint Streams  declare thy  Infancy    Thy rising  Fountains  she thought fit to shroud  And wrap'd thy  mantled Bosom  in a Cloud  Thence teaching  Nations  to admire thy Stream  And chuse  Applause  not  Knowledge  for their  Theam  A Discovery of the Sourse of  Nile  HOWEVER if we may believe the confident Reports of such  Egyp∣tians  as Inhabit Countries bordering on  Aethiopia  or indeed such  Aethiopi∣ans  themselves as will or dare Converse with Strangers  Nilus  rises in a great extent of  Marshy Grounds  surrounded by prodigious  Mountains  of an almost inaccessible Ascent the  Weeds  and  Rushes  so incumbering the un∣certain Waters that no  Boat  can pass from Hill to Hill and 'tis a more than dangerous Attempt to venture any other way on so deceitful a Foun∣dation yet  'tis said  that some have pass'd secure and seen a  Rock  of a stupendious Magnitude whence gush'd a Stream of roaring Waters with impetuous violence  'TIS said these Marshes lie near twelve Degrees beyond the  Aequator  and that the  Nile  forsaking his entangled Bed is found to wander in  maean∣dring Labyrinths  quite thro' prodigious  Desarts  spacious  Kingdoms  and re∣mote  Dominions  sometimes forming wond'rous  Lakes  and seeming to for∣get the Order of a River then recovering his spreading Waters and con∣tinuing a Course for many Leagues together  calm  and  gentle  swelling as he passes on to great increase by the reception of  encount'ring Currents  all im∣bib'd and carried on in his superior Channel every now and then sur∣rounding some delightful Piece of Ground and making  Islands  pleasant in their Situation and  agreeably Productive  of the gayest Sweets of aided Nature  The Course of the River  SOMETIMES rolling headlong from a  Mountainous  and  Rugged Country  to the  Vallies  under it it forms those loud and dreadful  Cataracts  so famous for the noise created by the Waters violently rushing from the lof∣ty  Precipices  and resisting  Rocks  that many Authors of  Antiquity  have join'd in the Reports that such Inhabitants as liv'd too near those  horrid WaterFalls  were by degrees made Deaf with their continual roaring  Where divi∣ded  THUS this great and celebrated River prosecutes his Course thro' many  Nations  till it enters  Egypt  there grown deep it smoothly runs with∣in its Banks in one broad Stream till near five Miles below  Grand Cairo  it becomes divided into two distinct and  Navigable Branches that  towards the  East  discharging all its  Waters  from a Mouth at  Damiata  situated on the  Mediterranean  and the  Western Branch  the  Old Canopus  likewise falling in∣to the abovenam'd  Sea  not far below  Rosetta  in the Neighbourhood of  Alexandria  Five of the Se∣ven Mouths of  Nilus  now quite lost  EXCEPTING many  Channels  cut by  Art  for the Convenien∣cy of letting  Waters  in upon the Country in the  Yearly Overflow  there now remain but these two  Branches  out of the  so often mention'd Seven  sometimes  Nine  which  Pliny Herodotus Ptolemy Diodorus Siculus  and other ancient Writers tell the World of they are now if ever such have been  choak'd up by Sand  or other common Accidents which are not seldom known to change the Course of Rivers in our  Europaean Parts  as well as  Egypt  The Rise or Increase of  Nilus  BUT  now  I come to treat of the Surprizing  Inundation  which this  River  causes  Yearly  in the Land of  Egypt  where it very seldom  Rains  and when it does tis rather  Mist  and never falls but in the  Winter Season  about  the  midst  of  June  the  Nile  Infallibly begins to rise thence Swelling by de∣grees till  August following  and Mounting in that Space the Height of two or three and Twenty  Cubits  WHEN thus it has encreas'd to a convenient Height the  Grand Ba∣shaw  of  Cairo  solemnly attended by the best of all his People comes upon the  Bank  and having given with his own Hand the  Warning Stroke  they cut it thro' in many Places where the  Water Rushes in  with an impetuous Current overflowing all the Country upon either side the  River  so con∣tinuing  many Days    Its Effects  then Suddenly  Decreasing  and  Retiring  orderly within its  Banks  leaves all the Land before a Desart cover'd Richly with a  Propagative Slime  of such an admirable Virtue that the  Corn  upon A∣batement of the Waters Scatter'd  Carelessly  about the  Surface  constantly produces  two good Crops  and sometimes more with equal plenty  And Decrease  not quite  Five Months  the Waters take in  Rise Continuance  and  Abatement  for about the  First  or  Second  of  November  all the Country  lately Delug'd  is entirely free'd from the invading Current which is  then  return'd to its ordinary Bounds and so continues till the  Year  Succeeding  TIS a Prospect highly  Pleasant  for a Stranger to behold a Country  Sud∣denly o'erwhelm'd  and  that  become a  Sea  which just  before  appear'd a  Desart  Men and Women briskly rowing up and down still more rejoicing the  more deep  they find the Waters  Their Pre∣sages by the Rising of the River  for from the  great  or  small encrease  of their  Presaging Nilus  they foretell  with ease  the neverfailing consequence of  Plenty  or a  Famine  THE great advantages accruing to this Country from the  Yearly o∣verflow of Nilus  being so extreamly plain and constant the  Rejoicings  which are made  on that occasion  are accordingly extravagant for when the Banks are Cut as I just now inform'd you all the  Noblemen  attend the  Great Bashaw  of  Cairo  to an  Ancient Castle  Built upon an  Island  in the  Mid∣dle of the River  where  Three Days together  they are Entertain'd and Feasted with the greatest Demonstrations of delight Imaginable  The Publick Rejoicings made in  Egypt  at the Over∣flow of  Nilus  NOR are the Common People equal Sharers in the Blessings of En∣crease less gratefull in acknowledging a Sense thereof but join una∣nimously in a Course of Mirth for many joyfull Days together forming Fireworks Singing Dancing Feasting with their Women and Employ∣ing all their time in one Incessant search of Pleasure and the constant practice of  Ʋninterrupted Gayety  NOW let us search a little into the Receiv'd Opinions of the  Learn∣ed World  and see if we can apprehend the Cause of this effect so won∣derfully different from the Common Course of  gradual Nature  Euripide's  Opi∣nion of the Cause thereof  AND First we find  Euripides  and many others of Opinion it pro∣ceeded from  Prodigious Thaws of Snow then Melted by the Sun upon the Aethiopian Mountains  but as we are certainly assured the constant Heat of that too Sultry Climate cannot suffer  Snow  to rest since even in  Egypt  it is never known not even on those Mountains which confine her Borders so the Modern Judgment of Politer Naturalists has quite re∣jected that mistaken Notion  The Opinion of  Thales Mile∣sius  THALES MILESIƲS  affirms that he believes the Inundation to proceed  from the continual Blowing of the Rough Etesian Winds  which then begin to Bluster from the  Northern Quarter  full upon the  Mouth of Nilus  hindering it thereby to enter the  Mediterranean  and violently  Driving back the Flood  upon the low and Sandy Ground of  Egypt  The Opinion of  Diodorus Siculus  BUT this is controverted by the Famous  Diodorus Siculus  in his First Book who to disprove the Argument of  Thales  Nominates some other Rivers equally expos'd to the  Etesian Winds  which yet are never liable to such like Inundations he therefore in dislike of this Opinion has prefer'd his own that Rain or Snow dis  olv'd from distant  Aethiopia  is the only Cause of an Effect so Wonderfull  The Opinion of  Herodotus  DIRECTLY Opposite to these is the Assertion of the Learned  He∣rodotus  who imagines that the  Sun  exhaling moisture in a great abundance from the River  Nilus  as he forms his Journey in the  Winter Tropick  causes it to run in an unnatural narrowness but when advancing towards the  Northern Climates  the Recovering River swells again with native Gran∣deur then possessing all its Streams and Flowing uncontroul'd with full Authority till the returning  Sun  again demands the Tribute of its Waters  The most re∣ceiv'd and probable Opi∣nion  AMONG all these the most receiv'd and probable Opinion is the First belief of  Diodorus Siculus that the Encrease of the Waters is occasion'd by continual Rains not Melting Snow upon the Hills of Aethiopia  and the Rea∣sons which are given in defence of this Assertion are as follow  Its Reasons  FIRST  for many Days before the Inundation happens all the Skies are seen in  Egypt  full of Black and Treatning Clouds incessantly produc∣ing  rumbling Noises  and by  Northern Tempests  driven fiercely towards the  Southern Parts  where always follows  Rain  in great abundance frequently near Threescore Days together  ANOTHER reason for this last opinion is the  Muddy thickness of the Waters when they overflow the Country  for Rushing violently thro' so many Tracts of Fertil Land they tear up great and hourly quantities of fatning soil which mixing thickly with the swelling streams is left upon the scorch'd and barren Sands of  Egypt  of a very deep and  slimy  substance  MANY other reasons are by the Inhabitants produc'd to prove the Justice and Solidity of this accepted Modern Notion but as tedious Ob∣servations and unnecessary Repetitions grow  Prolix  and  Heavy  on a Reader I will say no more upon the Present Subject than that all the  Naturalists  reputed Famous in the  Eastern Countries  agree among themselves in full belief of this Assertion  The goodness of the Water of the  Nilus  I must inform my Reader now that as this River boasts peculiar pro∣perties in  Fractifying  Nations to so rich a Plenty so its Blessings many other ways are equally particular his Waters are observ'd to be for ever free from  Mists  or  Vapours Sweet  to such an Admirable and uncommon relish that tis difficult if hoodwink'd to distinguish it from  Milk  How Clari∣fied  TIS Fam'd for many Operative Virtues in  Medicinal essays  and has but  one known Fault  which is a certain dusky thickness clouding its appear∣ance with a kind of dark unpleasant Colour which they  Clarifie  however in an Hour or two by casting into certain  Earthen Pots  wherein the Wa∣ter is contain'd small quantities of  bitter Almonds  bruis'd on purpose  Fish  by reason of the  just nam'd Muddiness  afford no delicate or pleasant tast and therefore is by Strangers seldom Eaten and neglected commonly by even the Natives of that Country  THE breadth of  Nilus  when within the Bounds of its own natural Course is equal to the  Thames  a Mile or two below the Bridge at  London  and upon the Banks on either side are built small poor and inconsiderable  Villages  inhabited promiscuously by  Turks  and  Arabs  The danger of Sailing on the  Nile  those last nam'd so insolently daring and extreamly dangerous to unsuspecting Travellers who pass in little Boats upon the River from  Grand Cairo  that they frequently attempt with Javelins in their Mouths to swim at  dead of Night  from some small Creek of the undreaded Shore and coming on them unawares kill take or plunder them as they may think convenient  A necessary Caution  HOWEVER led of late to think of their own safety by the many fa∣tal  Accidents  which have from time to time attended such as rashly trusted to implor'd  GoodFortune  and were disappointed of her Favours they have found a way to free the Passengers of their own Country or a Foreign one from those presumptious Insolences of  Arabian Robbers  for at present none attempt a Voyage on the  Nile  without providing usefull  FireArms  and ve∣ry frequently a  Guardian Janizary  by whose faithful Care and honest Courage they may be Protected safely from those villanous Outrages whose effects have  often  prov'd unhappy to the headstrong Resolutions of  unguarded Obstinacy  so cautious ought a Traveller to be who  ignorant of Danger  from an  ignorance of Custom  may unknowingly involve himself and Company in the unfear'd Misfortune of some treacherous swift and unexpected Ruin  CHAP XXX Of the Government of  Egypt  The History of  Egypt  from the  Roman  Conquest  IN Order to inform you of the present State of  Government  in  Egypt  'twill be necessary to inquire no further back in ancient History than the times in which the Great  Octavius  Emperor of  Rome  converted that extensive and subjected Kingdom to the meaner Title of a  Roman Province  which in that Condition was enlightned by the glorious Rays of introduc'd  Christianity  from the unwearied Labours of St  Mark  who suffer'd  Martyrdom  as I have said before at  Alexandria  Conquer'd by the  Greeks  THE  Graecian  Emperors upon the fatal weakning of the  Western  Power by the Division of the  Roman  Government became the  Lords  of  Egypt  and her People till oppressing them inhumanly by heavy Taxes and an arbi∣trary Tyranny they forcibly Revolted from their Yoke of Slavery and in order to expel the  Greeks  Authority invited to their Aid the hardy  Sa∣racens  Saracens  HOWEVER these about the Year of  Christ  six hundred thirty five were beaten from the Government they gain'd in the expulsion of the  Greeks  by the successful Arms of  Omir Kinsman  and  Successor  to the Power of the  Impostor Mahomet  And  Mahome∣tans  who satisfied with Tribute left them free to the Pro∣fession of their own Religion then fell they under the Dominion of the  Babylonian Caliphs  AFTERWARDS they chose a  Caliph  of their own who was suc∣ceeded in a long uninterrupted Line of full three hundred Years when  Alme∣ric  the  Sixth  King of  Jerusalem  invaded and reduc'd them to a great extremity  AMIDST this  exigency  they entreated Succour from the  Syrians  whose designing  Sultan  sent immediately a greater Aid than was demanded from him but as soon as they had beat the  Christians  back to their Pos∣sessions  Sarco  General of the  Syrian  Forces murder'd basely the  Egyptian Caliph  and usurp'd the Kingdom to his own Dominion  The Original of the  Circas∣sian Mama∣lukes  THE Mighty  Saladine  succeeded  Sarco  and for the space of seventy six Years the  Syrians  held Possession of this Kingdom till ambitious  MelecSalha'a  jealous of the Courage or Integrity of his  Egyptian Vassals  yearly bought prodigious numbers of  Circassian Slaves  from their Allies the  Tartars  and depending wholly on their Valour and Fidelity arm'd thousands of them till he had compleated his design'd and numerous Army  BY the Assistance of these bold and hardy Men he grew successfull in the Wars he made upon his Foes the  Christians  till at last the  Slaves  too well acquainted with the fatal Power wherewith he trusted them  ungratefully  Revolted from their just Obedience murder'd  MelecSalha'a  and upon the bloody Ruins of his broken Power erected a  New Form of Government  a∣mong themselves inviting into  Egypt  all their Countrymen or purcha∣sing in every Place as many of them as had formerly been taken  THUS the Government of these  revolted Slaves  became in time extreamly Powerfull dreadfull to their Enemies and rich in their Possessions still main∣taining their Dominions strongly and with resolution very near three hun∣dred Years whereby they grew a famous People and were known by the denomination of  Circassian Mamalukes  Their Over∣throw and Downfall  till  Sultan Selym  Emperor of the  Turks  in the Success of long and bloody Wars o'erthrew their Govern∣ment and so brought  Egypt  under his Subjection  Egypt  how govern'd by the  Turks  IN the Possession of the  Turks  it still remains and is at present govern'd by a kind of  ViceRoy  full Possessor of an arbitrary Power given him as  De∣puty  or  Great Vicegerent  to the absolute  Grand Signior  he takes his Title from the City of  Grand Cairo  is the first  Bashaw  of all the  Turkish Empire  continues seldom in his Government above three Years and constantly resides in that Imperial  City  DEPENDANT on the Power of this great  Bashaw  are the twelve  Beys  or  Lords Provincial  constantly elected from among the  Natives  of the Country and Assistant in the framing Laws and other matters to the  Grand Bashaw  who therefore looking on them as  Inspectors  of his Actions and set over him as Spys or Curbers of his  Inclinations  does generally  hate  and  contradict  them hence proceed intestine Jarrs and frequent Tumults not a little prejudicial to the Interest of the  Turkish Sultan  The Militia of  Egypt  IN order to support this Power a  Standing Army  is Establish'd in the  Turkish  manner which consists of twenty thousand Horse and eighty thousand Foot accomplish'd hardy and experienc'd Soldiers all de∣pendant on respective  Zaims  or their  Timariots  in the nature treated of at large in the beginning of this Book  Egypt  in its Modern Divi∣sions  THE  Modern Egypt  is divided into three Distinct and Spacious Provin∣ces that part which lies between  Rosetta  and the famous  Alexandria  is distinguish'd by the Name of  Hersiah  that part which lies between Grand  Cairo Tunese  and  Damiata  is now call'd  Marhemha  and the Land which lies upon the south of  Cairo  is in Turkish call'd  Saihid  The Humour of the People  THESE different Provinces produce Inhabitants as different in their Natures some are rougher than the rest and more unciviliz'd in com∣mon Conversation but it is a general observation that the nearer to the Port of  Alexandria  or the Sea about it so much more polite is found the humour of these People  Their Justice  THE Military Power is in  Egypt  as at  Constantinople  mixt entirely with the Civil Administration and the Laws of both exactly Copy'd from the  Turkish  Government so that neither in Religion Customs Habit or the forms of Justice can be found the smallest difference from what I have explain'd in the foregoing Part relating to the  Turkish  Policy 'Tis  Money  only Arbitrary Eloquent perswasive  Money  can prevail in  Egypt  as it e∣ver does in  Europaean Turky  to decide a Contest  Their Super∣stition  THE many Graces which in former times enrich'd the Minds of their Illustrious Ancestors are all forgotten but to show how prone Man's Nature is to Ill they still retain their ancient Superstition and tho' they do not practise the abolish'd Ceremonies of a rank Idolatry they yet impute such power to every little Accident or Work of  Nature  that they tread as near as possible in the detested Footsteps of those old  Egyptians  whom the  Roman  Satyrist has well derided in the following Verses  Juv  Sat  Quis nescit Volusi Bithynice qualia demens  Aegyptus portenta colat Crocodilon adorat  Pars haec illa pavet saturam serpentibus Ibin  Effigies sacri nitet aurea Cercopitheci  Dimidio Magicae resonant ubi Memnone chordae  Atque vetus Thebe centum jacet obruta portis  Illic coeruleos hic piscem fluminis illic  Oppida tota canem venerantur nemo Dianam  Porrum cepe nefas violare ac frangere Morsu  O sanctas gentes quibus haec nascuntur in hortis  Numina lanatis animalibus abstinet omnis  Mensa nefas illic foetum jugulare capellae  Carnibus humanis vesci licet  Who knows not what fond Worship and vain Praise  Mad  Egypt  to prodigious Monsters pays  This  part the  Crocodile  a Godhead makes  That  honours frightful  Ibis  fed with Snakes  There golden Images of  Monkeys  shine  And sacred Worship crowns the apish Shrine  Where Magick Spells make  halfleft Memnon  sound  And ancient  Thebes  now lies a ruin'd Ground  Thebes  which twice fifty Gates did once surround  Here SeaFish there the River Fish they own  To  Dogs  whole Cities bow but to  Diana  none  A wondrous wickedness indeed to eat  A sacred  Leek  or make an  Onion  Meat  O blessed People in whose Gardens grow  These  Gods  to whom such wondrous helps you owe  From woolly Animals each Board abstains  To kill a  Kid  pollutes their Soul with Stains  Yet none by Conscience led from humane Flesh refrains  The Effects of Misery  THE Miserable Poverty whose ill Effects have crush'd the Spirits of the Warlike  Graecians  and subverted Valour to contented Slavery has work'd so deeply on the humble Minds of the depress'd  Egyptians  that they daily more and more become Effeminate neglecting meanly the once lov'd Practices of MartialDiscipline and idly sinking in a stupifi'd forgetfulness of all the calls of Liberty or Honour  Their Chara∣cter  THEY are very Lazy Proud and Insolent in Carriage Dirty in their Dress and stiff in their Behaviour haters and despisers of all other Coun∣tries scarce affording Love to one another and so very nasty in their Tents or Houses that the very entrance is offensive to a Christian Stranger  The  Egyptian  Moors  THERE are besides the Offspring of the old  Egyptians  certain tawny Natives of this Land a Sunburnt Mongrel kind of Race descended from the  Arabs  and in strength of Body Humour Shrilness of their Speech and great Agility not much unlike them for Distinctionsake these Men are call'd the  Moors  of  Egypt  but are commonly more honestly inclin'd than are their numerous Copartners in that wide Denomination  Their Govern∣ment a Copy of the  Turkish  THE Towns of  Egypt  are not many and those few they have but ill de∣fended rather trusting to the number of their People than the strength of Walls or tedious helps of Modern Fortification each Town and Village has its Governor and as I said before the nature of their Government is so entirely  Turkish  that I need no longer dwell upon the Subject of this Chapter but will hasten in the next to look a little into the condition of their Learning and Morality and see if we can trace the Footsteps of their great  Forefathers  in the Modern Applications of their lost Posterity  CHAP XXXI Of the Learning and Morals of the  Egyptians  Egypt  in her present Igno∣rance a Proof of Humane Frailty  THE Curious Searcher into  Humane Changes  and the various Mi∣series attending  Life  can never find a fairer Proof of  Sublunary  Frailty than he has before him in a nice Reflection on the present State of the  Egyptian  Learning  Egypt  which of old possess'd unbounded Knowledge and unlimited Dominion  Egypt  which outtowr'd not only the Felicity but even the Imitation of admiring Neigh∣bours  Egypt  from whose Source of Wisdom  Greece  originally drew those Channels from whose unexhausted Store she afterwards supplied the spaci∣ous Universe  Egypt  the neglected Mother of our  Arts  and  Sciences  is now involv'd in stupid Ignorance and boasts no more than that unpolish'd com∣mon Sense we owe promiscuously to Liberal Nature  THE black effects of  Time  and  Discord  have amazingly subverted an∣cient Splendor and the glorious State of  Learning  which in former Ages flourish'd in this Country left her with the Blessings of that wealthy Peace  she once could boast of Knowledge fell a Victim to the Sword and the Destruction which befell them was so very  Ʋniversal  not alone to  Power  but even the well establish'd Principles of  Literature  and  Morality  that when I think upon the Ruin of the  Old Egyptians  who surviv'd the loss of all worth living for and then fell  lastly  solitary Victims to their Nations Enemies it brings to my remembrance the Expressions  Seneca  thought fit to use upon the Fate of  Priamus  in his Tragedy of  Troas  Sen Trag Troas  Felix Priamus  Felix quisquis bello morions  Omnia secum consumpta videt  O happy  Priamus  And happy  all  who when in  War  they die  In  one destructive Fate  see all things with them lie  The Origin of the  Egyptian  Ignorance  THE gloomy Cloud of unaspiring Sloth and dull Stupidity which now possesses fallen  Egypt  hence receiv'd its fatal  Origin  and ever since has skreen'd the Sun of banish'd Learning from that miserable Country nor has even the most retir'd and private State of Life escap'd the general Ca∣lamity which spread its Influence with an uncontroul'd and Univer∣sal Ruin  AND indeed it is a vain and groundless hope for an unthinking Man to flatter his Opinion with the strange Belief of even a possibility to live contented in a sinking Government or stand unshock'd in the destructi∣on of his Country tho' the share he boasted in the management thereof was ne'er so small or inconsiderable or even tho' the trifling Part he acted in its Welfare was so far from helping to support the State that he ap∣pear'd the most unknown and useless Member of his Nation  THE admirable  Solon  an unequall'd  Former  of the wisest Laws and consequently an undoubted  Judge  in Rules of Policy has left us his Opini∣on on the matter in the eloquent Expressions following  Solon  's Opini∣on of a Pub∣lick Ill  When  PublickIlls  do  CommonWealths  impair  Each  Private Subject  feels a  Publick Share  No  barring Gates  can its effects  exclude  O'er highest  Walls  it climbs and will intrude  Still it  o'ertakes  you if to  Shades  you fly  And finds you tho' in  latent Beds  you lie  Sciences in∣vented by the old  Egyptians  THE old  Egyptians  first invented  Musick  and  Geometry  with the usefull Knowledge of  Arithmetic  they first inspected Heaven and bravely trac'd the Sun and Starrs thro' their Diurnal Motions they first divided Years by Months and from a Knowledge of the various Aspects of  Caelesti∣al Constellations  grew  Diviners  of portended Consequences  Philosophy  and the transporting Flights of a  Poetic Harmony  were first known there  Hierogly∣phics what they were  MECHANIC ARTS  tho' since improv'd were numerously owing to the deep invention of  Egyptian fancy Hieroglyphicks  us'd instead of Characters explain'd the meaning of the wisest thoughts by silent Images  of various kinds whereby they strangely represented Humane Nature in its different Passions with a very still but moving Eloquence  BUT now the very Memory of these Perfections is itsself forgotten by the Deviated Souls of the Possessors of this Country in its  Modern State  of  Folly Pride  and  Insolence  and all an Author is enabled to inform the World of the Condition of their  Learning  is that they have really none among them  No Learning in  Egypt  now  tis a Wonder if in many Villages of  Egypt  well inhabited Ten Men are found who boast capacity to  Read  or  Write  my Reader will not there∣fore be Surpriz'd when I assure him that for any more refin'd and ele∣vated kind of knowledge they are altogether Strangers to the very no∣tion of its usefullness  NOR can I give their  Morals  a much fairer Character than I have justly fix'd upon their  Learning Morality  is commonly the good effect of Honest thoughts produc'd by some Improvement of the Mind in serious Contemplation on the  Worth of Vertue  and the only way to reach the Power of so bright a Contemplation is by aiming at as great a share of com∣mon  Knowledge  as we can with ease attain in humble Stations  Why Morali∣ty is seldom found in  Egypt  'tis not therefore probable or possible that these  Egyptians  void by the Tyrannic and oppressive Constitution of their Government of any means to reach such Practice nor indeed desirous by the bent of Inclination to endea∣vour after it should e're attain the happy end it constantly produces  I have in the  Preceeding Chapter  spoke in general of their Obvious Principles the less will therefore serve me here since I can only use the same Expressions or at least in other words declare the same Assertion should I now enlarge upon the  Shallow Subject    The  Egyptians  very covetous  I will therefore only add that they are Avaritiously inclin'd almost beyond a Parallel and as desirous eagerly of growing Rich will scruple nothing to obtain the Bles∣sing hence it will be an easy thing to guess how far from  Vertue Ho∣nesty  or  Justice  lies the Course they Darkly steer in  Nam Dives qui fieri vult  Et citò vult fieri sed quae reverentia legum  Quis metus aut pudor est unquam Properantis avari  For he who has on  Riches  bent his Mind  Would still to  Wealth  a Speedy Passage find  But what respect to  Laws  what  Fear  or  Shame  Restrains the  Eager Wretch  who does at  Avarice  aim  I hasten from a Subject  Melancholy  in its Truth and thence Oppres∣sive and a  Clog  upon my fansie But alas we find no part of Earth but has sometimes experienc'd Rugged Changes and our own Examples may convince us daily that the Scourge of Fortune Triumphs frequently in other Parts as well as  Egypt  CHAP XXXII Of the  Beasts Birds  and  Serpents  of  Egypt  AMONG the numerous Observations Travellers may make in  Egypt  of a thousand things peculiar to that Country none deserves remark more justly than the Vertue it can boast of in producing  Creatures  as uncommon and particular as are the many  Artificial Rarities  they have in every Age been famous for  The  Hippota∣mus  or  SeaHorse  AND first to mention none of those more common  Animals  which may be found promiscuously in almost every Country the  Hippotamus  or  Sea Horse  of old more frequently observ'd about the River  Nilus  than in later times for  Pliny Herodotus Diodorus Siculus  and many other Au∣thors have describ'd them in their Writings some of which have autho∣riz'd their full Descriptions by their own Eyewitness  Describ'd  BUT at present 'tis a Curiosity not often met with to obtain an op∣portunity of seeing any of these  Creatures  they have Heads of a prodigious size their Jaws of very large extent and full of Tusks in colour not unlike the whitest  Ivory  but sharp as  Needles  and their bite of very dangerous Consequence to wounded Passengers  Their strength and fierceness  IN Shape they differ not extreamly from a  Boar  but are so much be∣yond him in proportion that we seldom see an  Ox  of greater Magnitude Their Colour is a dusky Brown and all their Backs so arm'd with Scales of an impenetrable Substance that the sharpest Weapons seldom wound them They are commonly of such a fierce  vindictive  Nature that they rarely fail to turn with violence upon a  Boat  when any in it have attempted to in∣snare them and have oftentimes been known to rear themselves stupendi∣ously above the Water and by overturning Vessels prey upon the Mari∣ners they thence grew Masters of  The  River Bull  THERE is another Beast of an  Amphibious Nature  commonly distin∣guish'd by the Name of  River Bull  not much beyond a  Calf  in bigness nor unlike him in Appearance only so superior in the Strength of Body that the spacious Nets the Natives make of twisted Ropes have often prov'd too weak to hold him they have  Finns  upon their Feet which spread at bot∣tom to considerable breadth and serve as Guides to their unweildy Moti∣ons which by plunging forward with an unresisted Violence break fierce∣ly thro' the strongest obstacles  The  Crocodile  THE Treacherous  Crocodile  so call'd from a Traditional Account that this deceitfull Animal commands his  Tears  at any Season and by coun∣terfeiting a complaining Human Voice allures the Curiosity of Passers by and then devours them is very common on the Banks of  Nile  and ever has been look'd upon peculiar to the Land of  Egypt  The Shape exactly like a  Lizard  is so fully known in  Europe  that 'tis needless here to say much of it  Their Na∣tures  THEIR Nature is  Oviparous  and when they lay their  Eggs  they hide them in the Sand with such an admirable Cunning that the overflowing of the River  Nilus  never reaches them tho' frequently it comes within a yard or two and hence the Country People finding now and then their Art∣full Nests are taught how high the Inundation will advance the Waters in that increase a  Turkeys Egg  is equal to the  Crocodiles  if not Superior in its  Pristine Magnitude  but afterwards they grow to such amazing length and size that many have been found  eleven Yards long  and in their Bulk proportionable  THE common notion entertain'd in  Egypt  is that every  Female Croco∣dile  can lay  one Hundred Eggs  and that their Age has often reach'd the  Hundredth Year  Their way of Catching Men  THEIR  Tails  are very long and sharpning to the End whereby they constantly Entwine and Seize their  Prey  and tis a very dangerous thing for  Travellers  who pass the  Nile  in  open Boats  to Sleep with Heads inclin'd upon the side for these observant Creatures gather frequently about the Ves∣sel watching cautiously some favourable Opportunity which when they Spie they  Swim up  close upon the Surface of the Water and enfolding the unwary Person by a sudden  Throwing out their Tails  have often so unhap∣pily succeeded as to draw him Headlong from the Vessel and devour him in the River  How Taken  THE Natives of the Country bait  Sharp Iron Hooks  of mighty Magni∣tude and sometimes take them They esteem their Flesh of Savory relish and as such will seldom Scruple Eating it But as this Creature is ex∣treamly hurtfull on the Water Playing on its Surface in a  Moonlight Night  so he is no less Destructive  on the Land by Day  for then he generally Wan∣ders up and down in search of  Mischief  Preying on whatever he can meet with  How to be a∣voided  THEY are Mighty  Swift  at Running in a line but having only one con∣tinued joint along their Back are tedious in a motion Circular or any ways Uneven and thereby with ease avoided by a Man acquainted with the Coun∣try and their Nature Oftentimes they lie a Foot or two  below the Surface  in the Places whence the  Peasants  living on the Banks of  Nilus  fetch their Water and have sometimes seiz'd a Man or Woman by the Arm and drawn them in But to prevent such dangers for the Future the  Egyptians  generally take the Pains  at present  to secure their Watering Places by a kind of Hedge which they support with Stakes and so protect themselves from these designing Animals who have been long so hated by the prejudic'd Inhabitants that they have us'd a Thousand Arts to compass their De∣struction and it is not common  now  to see a  Crocodile  within the space of some Days Journey from the City of  Grand Cairo  A Wonderful Observation of the  Croco∣dile  and little Bird  IT is observable that there is found in  Egypt  tho' but rarely known a  little Bird  about the Bigness of a common  Quail  its Colour of a  Light∣ish Grey  the Bill extreamly sharp and small and both the  Wings  con∣taining Feathers at the End whereof are certain  Prickles  not unlike the  Bristles  of a  Hog this Bird  as often as she finds the  Crocodile  lie Basking in the Sun and Slumbering as he often does upon the Banks of  Nilus  with his Mouth wide open flies  directly in  and fixing near his Teeth erects her  Prickly Wings  not much unlike a  Porcupine  or  Hedge Hog  so preventing him from closeing his great Mouth upon her while she feeds herself by picking somewhat from his Teeth The  Bird  was  formerly  more taken Notice of than she has been of late and commonly distinguish'd by the Name of  Trochileus  Ichneumon or the  River Rat  BUT while the  Crocodile  diverted by a kind of tickling Pleasure which the pecking Bill of the Bird  Trochileus  affords him gapes considerably wider than he generally does the  River Rat  a little Beast about the bigness of a  Ferret  clean in Shape in colour Black and of a Skin extreamly smooth his Teeth long sharp and very numerous his Tail of an uncommon length his Legs but short and Ears of a peculiar roundness of a Nature very bold and fierce beyond example this small Beast I say who bears a strong an∣tipathy to the abovenam'd  Crocodile  observing narrowly the tempting Opportunity comes slily round jumps thro' his Mouth and with a won∣d'rous swiftness passing down his Throat gnaws forcibly a Passage thro' his Belly thence escaping with the triumph of a sure Destruction to his mortal Enemy  Its fierceness and great ha∣tred to other Creatures  THIS  River Rat  is sometimes call'd  Ichneumon  which appears to have been anciently the Name by which he was distinguish'd by the Curious and more Learn'd  Egyptians  then inhabiting the Country he is found in they are of a mischievous Nature killing all the  Pidgeons Hens  and  Poul∣try  they can possibly find means to get at  Cats  and  Dogs  they hate ex∣treamly and will  kill  as often as they  conquer  them nor ever fail Assaulting them as often as they find convenient Opportunity But as in  some things  they are hurtfull to the Interests of the People so in  many others  they appear not only Usefull but even Necessary for the good they do by seeking constantly the  Eggs  of  Crocodiles  and breaking them when they discover where they lie as also for their Universal Hatred to all kinds of  Serpents Snakes  or  Reptiles  whatsoever whom they often fall upon and kill with wonderfull dexterity  Moral Re∣flections  HOW wisely and beyond the apprehension of our weak Capacities has the  Supream Creator  of our Earthly Beings guided the Performances of his  Divine Omnipotence  To what an height of Piety and necessary Con∣templation on the Bounties and Omniscience of  Almighty God  must that Man needs arrive who seriously reflects upon the numerous Works of his  Creation  yet amongst so many Millions of surprizing Differences and di∣rectly opposite Existences in Nature cannot find one needless  Insect  but perceives them strangely mixt together in the joint Advancement of one common Interest  The  Chamae∣lions  IN many  Orchards  near  Grand Cairo  may be found great numbers of those Creatures call'd  Chamaelions  falsely said to live upon the Air which notwithstanding is indeed their  principal  Subsistance tho' they prey con∣tinually on Flies and extend their Tongue with wonderfull celerity which is in length not much inferior to his Body naturally hollow in its top whereby he may more easily attain his Ends and serve himself in the De∣struction of the late nam'd  Insects  with a little trouble  Describ'd  IN Shape and Size they are not much unlike the  Lizard  their Eyes and Head extreamly large their Necks unjointed and of consequence not mov'd without the turning their whole Bodies its native Colour is a gree∣nish Yellow with small Spots of white about the Belly They are seen with difficulty tho' you pass at little distance from them for they constant∣ly assume the Colour of most Places which they stand upon and gene∣rally change their Hue as often as they find occasion to remove their Sta∣tion  Their Anti∣pathy to  Ser∣pents  THESE also bear an  innate Enmity  to every kind of  Serpent  and it is remarkable that when they have discover'd any Sleeping underneath a Tree they never rest till having climb'd the Branches they direct a little shining drop of Moisture from their Mouths exactly on his Head which by  a certain natural Vertue it possesses never fails to give immediate Death to the  unwary Serpent  so invaded  The  Ostrich  I must not here omit the  Ostrich  tho' but very rarely found unless in the  remoter  and  more Inland  parts  of Egypt  It is a  Bird  of Mighty size long Neck and Feet with Head and every other part of Shape extreamly near the  Pictures  which we draw to represent them  How Hunted  They have Wings of spa∣cious size yet Fly but heavily so near the Ground that tis an Entertain∣ment very Pleasant and  not seldom us'd  for  Gentlemen  to  Hunt them  with a kind of  Spears  on Foot for the  Resistance Awkard motions  and  Ʋnweildy Flight  they make afford their Hunters an agreeable Amusement  An Eater of Iron  BUT the most Remarkable peculiar and surprizing Property the  Ostrich  boasts of is that he not only Eats but even Digests the  hardest Iron  Picking up with pleasure  broken HorseShooes rusty Nails  and many other things especially at certain Seasons of the Year when they incline I know not for what reason to take more delight than usual in the Swal∣lowing  that Metal    And Hater of Women Preg∣nant  It is a thing worth Notice that from certain hidden Dictates of directing Nature  Ostriches  are led  to an abhorrence of a Woman big with Child  and tis a certain truth from a repeated Observation that they are not only sensible when such a Person is brought near them but will make directly  towards her  and with lifted Feet endeavour to oblige her to withdraw or Patiently submit to their Unwelcome violence  The  Salaman∣der  THE  Salamander  Famous for resisting Fire is in  Egypt  often found but tis a false and groundless notion  that he lives in Flames  but probably that old mi∣stake First took its Rise from something that appear'd like reason  How resisting Fire  for a  certain Cold  and  Mucous Substance  full of  Moisture  is the only Flesh  that Crea∣ture  boasts of who when put upon the Fire can  emit  a certain quantity of  Black  and  Slimy Matter  which extinguishes for some short time the Coals about him but by that time he has once or twice repeated the Experiment he becomes  Exhausted  and is forc'd to yield his Body to the Irresistible In∣vasion of the Flames he lies in  The  Basalisk  or  Cockatrice  THE Famous  Serpent  call'd a  Basilisk  or in our vulgar  English  Tongue distinguish'd better by the Name of  Cockatrice  does still remain in many parts of inmost  Egypt  but was falsely  by the Ancients  said to be possess'd of such a  Penetrative Venom  that his  very look  gave present Death to every Man he fix'd his Eyes upon whose subtil Poyson  Lucan  thus describes a∣mong the many  Noxious Serpents Cato  met with in his March with the  Brave Roman Army  thro' the Sands of  Africa  Lucan lib    Sibila{que} effundens cunctas terrentia pestes  Ante venena nocens late sibi submovet omne  Vulgus in vacuâ regnat  Basiliscus  arená  The  Basilisk  whose Dreadfull  Hisses  fright  All  other Serpents  into distant flight  Whose  Subtil Venom  humane life confounds  Nor needs a  Touch  but  Kills  before it  Wounds  Drives  meaner Snakes  from his frequented Plains  And on the  empty Sands  in frightfull horror Reigns  Why said to Kill with a look  BUT those which now are call'd the  Basilisks  of  Egypt  are not so extreamly dangerous as the abovenam'd  Poet  chose to represent them yet 'tis certain that they bear a kind of natural malignity about them which affects a Man tho' at a considerable distance with a strange uneasiness but whether Seated in their Eyes or caus'd by the  Effluviums  of their  Noxious  Bodies  does not come within my purpose and is therefore left to the Opini∣on of the Reader  The  Asp  de∣scrib'd  THE  Asp  another hurtful  Serpent  is in many Parts of  Egypt  dange∣rously known a small black Creature  running swiftly  and is generally found within the hollow Places of a Rock or rotten Root of some decaying Tree Their  Bite  is  Mortal  and the Death they give attended frequently by  va∣rious Symptoms  but overtaking all he bites with  equal  swiftness  some  Die Laughing  others  Weeping  many  Sleeping but this last effect should seem to be the most peculiar to the  Asps  of old since  Lucan  thus describes the Nature of that  Serpent  Lucan  Lib  Hic quae prima caput movit de pulvere tabes  Aspida  somniferam tumidâ cervice levavit  Plenior huic sanguis crassi gutta veneni  Decidit in nullâ plus est Serpente coactum  Here the  Sleepcausing Asp  with swelling Head  Rose first from  Poysonmingled Atoms  bred  Full of the thickest Blood  Gorgon  o'er  Libya  spread  Nor 'mongst the many  Snakes  which  thence  did spring  Can  one  be found who boasts a more  invenom'd Sting  A Story of a Gentleman bit by an  Asp  SOME Years ago an  English Gentleman  residing at  Aleppo  and in Com∣pany with many  Merchants  belonging to the  Factory  there Establish'd went  a Hunting  and amongst an heap of  Stones  upon the  Sand  perceiv'd an  Asp  run swiftly to its Hole which fatally mistaking for a little  Squirrel  he immediately alighted from his Horse and thrusting in his  Arm  as far as it would go felt something sharper than he thought to meet withall and drawing out his Hand upon a sudden brought the  Asp  still  hanging by the Teeth  upon his middle  Finger  The immediate  Exclamations  of the  Gentle∣men in Company  oblig'd him presently to shake it off but all in vain the  Poy∣son  had affected him too deeply and tho' with much ado they got him on his Horse he strait grew  Mad Laugh'd Wept  and  Fainted  by successive turns till they had brought him  Home  to his  Ʋnhappy Family  where  instant∣ly  he  Died  by the  unfortunate Event  of this  lamented Accident  CHAP XXXIII Of the  Cities  of  GrandCairo Memphis  and  Babylon  THE venerable  Marks  of mighty  Age  declare the  Towns  I am about to speak of  Children of Antiquity  nor did they only flourish when the  World  was  Young  but were from  Time to Time  the Glo∣rious  Scenes  whereon were represented the Prodigious  Sallies  of  Ambition  starting suddenly to  Ʋniversal Empire  then as suddenly declining  from its  Pinacle  and yielding  Fortune  for a transitory Spurt to the  Possession  of some other rising Monarchy  The Changes which have hapned in  Grand Cairo Memphis  and  Babylon  'TWAS  hence  that these renown'd and stately  Cities  have successively beheld the Haughty  Pharaohs  and Luxurious  Ptolemies  the  Roman Caesars  and profuse Extravagance of the Unhappy  Cleopatra  have beheld 'em swoln above Mortality with elevated Pomp and splendid Royalty and after all the Triumphs of a shortliv'd Grandeur seen 'em sink the miserable Victims to some sudden strange and unexpected Ruin  'TWAS here  of old  that the Almighty Hand of  God  himself per∣form'd such Miracles 'twas here the hardned Heart of  Pharaoh  drew down Vengeance on his tortur'd Nation 'twas here the  Israelites  were chain'd in long Captivity and in returning hence their  Great Redeemer  prov'd his Power by dividing Seas to let them pass and guiding them alternately by  Clouds  and  Fiery Pillars  through the numerous Dangers of a tedious  Pil∣grimage  THIS  Train of Wonders  and amazing  Scene  of  Human Changes  were in ancient Times transacted here  The decay these Cities  and the abovenam'd Cities which so many Ages have withstood the Shocks of Time or Accident and glori∣ously outliv'd the frequent Downfalls of unnumbred  Rulers  now begin to sink  Themselves  and prove by slow tho' sure Experience that the strange Vicissitudes of Earthly Strength involve alike the  Prince  and  Pea∣sant Town  and  Hovel  in a dark oblivion  Cairo  now the best  CAIRO  is the only City of the  Three  which now retains the smallest Mark of an unruin'd  Majesty  and has its Situation near four hundred Miles from  Alexandria  upon the  Eastern side  of  Nilus  not above twelve Fur∣longs distant from the River  Bowlac  the Port to  Cairo  THE Boats which commonly bring Passengers to  Cairo  land 'em at  Bowlac  a small  Port Town  supported by the Trade the River brings her where a sort of  Tax  or  Imposition  by the way of  Poll  is laid on every  Chri∣stian Traveller  who comes on Shore amounting to about  a Crown a Head  and here it is that we are all oblig'd to hire a nimble kind of  Asses  with their Owners running by on Foot to carry us to  Cairo  A barbarous Baseness of the  Turks  at  Cairo  where the Reader may take notice that the barbarous Insolence and blinded Zeal of the rude  Turks  inhabiting the Place oblige all  Christians  who wou'd ride about the City to be mounted on those Creatures in a strange derision of our Blessed  Saviour  's Choice who rode upon an  Ass  when the transported Multitude saluted him as he advanc'd with the repeated Acclamation of  Hosanna to the Highest  The Town and its Ex∣tent  THE Town is built about the Foot of a large  Mountain  call'd  Muchaat  extreamly Rocky and extends its Buildings in a Semicircular Form above half round it it is Wall'd but ill and taking in the Suburbs which are ve∣ry large is so prodigiously extensive that the measur'd Compass has been found full sixty two  Italian  Miles  Description of the Houses and manner of their building Streets  THE Streets are crooked long and narrow all the Houses those excepted which the  Turks  have built of later Years of solid Stone and many Stories high their Roofs are Flat and open in the top with artificial Neatness to let in the  Breezes  which at certain Seasons of the Day regale the Air with comfortable Coolness the Streets are every Night lock'd up at either End by welldefended Gates at each whereof is kept a Guard of able  Watchmen  so that all the Mischiefs of  Nocturnal Robberies  are here preven∣ted by the visible Impossibility that  Thieves  wou'd find to get away if they shou'd chance to be discover'd  The Gates of  Grand Cairo  THE  HighStreet  is of a considerable Breadth extending from the Gate  Naufrei  to that they call  Zueelia  the First admitting you from the great Road which leads to the  Red Sea  the last directly fronting  Nilus  and  Bowlac  the Ancient Town I lately spoke of These two Gates confine the Length of this extensive City  A Pleasant Lake  ANOTHER Gate distinguish'd by the Name of  Futulee  which opens on the  Northern side  directly leads you to a Spacious  Lake  call'd  Es∣bikee  that in the overflow of  Nilus  is supplied with Water and frequent∣ed while it is so by the Painted Barges of the Gentlemen of  Cairo  shaded over with the Greenest Boughs and Rowing up and down with Wine and Musick in delightfull Pastime But when  Nilus  is decreas'd and all the Water dried within the  Lake  it changes its appearance to ano∣ther Scene and by affording  Corn  in plentifull Production yields a Pro∣spect equally agreeable  Some other Gates  BESIDES these Three Chief Gates are many other for conveniency of free Egress and Regress thro' the City but as those are only Portals for a  Private use  not  Publick Ostentation  they deserve not the unnecessary Trouble of Remarks upon their  Number Forms  or  Situation  Their way of Darkening the Streets  THE  Sun  is here so greatly Incommodious that to Skreen the City from its Power they commonly place Rafters cross their Streets and co∣ver them with Mats which by preventing the abovenam'd Inconveniency is found to cause another nigh as bad for by excluding the  SunBeams  from Shining on them they are forc'd to Walk as in the Dark in many Places where the Narrowness of Streets and Jetting form of all their Buildings added to the Dullness they are Cloak'd in by the Matts and Rafters join together in a close alliance to keep out the  Day  and Cloud the Houses even at  Noon  with the unpleasant Veil of counterfeited  Midnight  Wooden Locks and Keys  ONE thing deserves Remark among the many others which a Stran∣ger may observe in  Cairo  that is they have so excellent an Art in Working upon Wood that all the  Locks  and  Keys  they use about their Houses are of a hard kind of Tree in Colour Blacker than the Box and in its substance far more hard and doubly durable  THE Streets are all unpav'd and full of Sand and many  Lakes  of half a Mile or sometimes more in Compass scatter'd every here and there about the City which with certain Wells of no small depth or Num∣ber serve the People with the Water fit to be employ'd in common uses such as  Washing Houses Cooling Streets  or such like purposes  Water brought on Camels Backs  but as for what they Drink 'tis brought on  Camels Backs  from  Nilus  that above∣nam'd being neither Clear nor Sweet enough for that nice purpose  A Noble  Mar∣ket Place  DIRECTLY in the  Center  of this Spacious City stands a Build∣ing not unlike the  Besesteen  or  Vaulted MarketPlace  I spoke of in the Chapter of  Constantinople  and design'd exactly for the same occasion Hither Flock vast Numbers of all kinds of People who wou'd purchase any thing of value for 'tis here they may be sure to meet with what they search for and it is observable in  Cairo  that they never mingle  Trades  together but appoint the Men of each Profession Rows of Shops by one another every one whereof must Shut his Doors at Five a Clock in the Evening the  Cooks  alone excepted who by reason of their common usefullness few Families in  Cairo  dressing their own Meat are suf∣fer'd to continue open till whatever Hour they think convenient  Pleasant Gar∣dens  WITHIN the Walls of  Cairo  are vast Numbers of delightful Or∣chards Gardens and the like in which are ever growing most delicious Fruits of almost every kind but Apples which are here but very rarely met withall their Oranges and Limons Almonds Dates and many o∣ther sorts do here arrive to such mature Perfection that I never tasted them so richly pleasant in another Country  Their Bag∣nios and Hos∣pitals  THEIR  Public Buildings  are both numerous and stately  Bagnio's  in  GrandCairo  fall not short of those I mention'd to be built at  Constantinople  and the rich Endowments of not only  those  but  Hans  or  Hospitals  for se∣veral Uses are so very splendidly encreas'd in this  Egyptian City  that they cannot be exceeded by the Buildings of their kind in any part of the  Grand Signior  's Empire  Mosques an incredible Number  THEIR  Mosques  are so magnificent in Structure and prodigious in the Number commonly reported that 'twou'd perhaps be thought a False∣hood shou'd I tell my Reader what my Guides told me that they sur∣pass in costliness of Building all the  Royal Mosques  of  Constantinople  and are so extreamly Numerous that they are reckon'd almost Twenty Thousand  BOTH these Opinions I believe untrue tho' I perceiv'd that in the first they have not stretch'd Veracity to any great degree but in the se∣cond I presume they have made full amends tho' all a  Traveller  can do is only to pursue the dictates of a reasonable Probability when he directs his Judgment on that Point since they are really so stupendious in their Number that 'tis morally Impossible for any single Man to know ex∣actly  The Great Men's Pala∣ces  THE Great Mens Palaces are very Stately and have large CourtYards before 'em opening to the Street with Wooden Gates of an uncommon Magnitude They have a very Insolent and Idle Custom here to pull a  Christian  from his  Ass  as he rides by the House of any  Turkish  Officer of Note and make him walk till he is pass'd the Wall in token of Submission and a mute acknowledgment of Inferiority  Cairo  very Populous  THIS famous City is so very  Populous  tho' of so vast a Magnitude that as we rode along the Streets about the  Center  we were so extreamly  Crowded  that our  Guide  who went before with a  long Pole  and clear'd the way by crying out  Bdaharack Adamlerr Bdaharack  that is  Make room good People pray make room  had much ado to open us a Passage  The Castle of  Grand Cairo  UPON a very steep and lofty Precipice upon the  Southern  side of  Cairo  stands the Castle where resides the  Grand Bashaw  in pompous State be∣coming his Degree attended by a chosen Guard of  Turkish Janizaries  Here on the three first Days of every Week they hold  Divan  at which the  Grand Bashaw  is always Present and  Administers their Justice  as they  Practice their Religion  both in Imitation of the settled  Forms  and ceremonious  Customs  of the  Turkish Government  Establish'd as before describ'd at their  Metropolis Constantinople  Its Ascent And Prospect  THIS Castle is to be ascended but by one Way only which is hewn with admirable  Art  and  Labour  from the  solid Rock  and twining round permits a Horseman easily to mount its  Summit  'Tis of vast Extent divi∣ded  in the ancient manner  into  Courts  and  Squares  which seem to have been formerly design'd for  Warlike Exercises  And Prospect  HENCE the City may with ease be overlook'd from any of the Walls which are all built of Massy Stone upon the  Rock  it self and entred by a Port amazingly secur'd with Iron Gates and leading to the Castle by strange intricate and winding Passages  Fine Reliques of Antiquity  OF Old the Mighty  Sultans  of the Brave  Egyptian Mamalukes  resided here in all the Grandeur Empire cou'd afford 'em and tho'  Sultan Selym  the Victorious  Turk  defac'd its Ornaments in many Places yet there still remain such tow'ring Piles and Marble Columns of so strange a Bulk and Workmanship so excellent that they to this Day show a thousand Proofs of  Regal Majesty  and that prodigious Stateliness wherewith it flourish'd in its old Magnificence  An Hierogly∣phic Obelisk  DIRECTLY in the midst of a large Court upon the backside of this Castle stands an ancient  Hieroglyphic Obelisk  near nineteen Foot in height whereon are represented such distinguishable Figures as do plainly prove it to have been plac'd there by the  Ptolemies  in Commemoration of the Victories they had obtain'd in War and the surprizing Grandeur in whose Bliss they flourish'd  Several Ruins near  Grand Cairo  THERE are not many  Reliques  of  Antiquity  at present to be seen in  Cairo  Besides this Castle there remain the Ruins of some famous Palaces but so disguis'd by their Decay that Travellers can only Guess at what they were when many  Ages  since they proudly flourish'd  The Place where  Moses  was found by  Pharaoh  's Daughter  THEY shew such Strangers  notwithstanding  as are curious in their Searches many Things worth Observation and among the rest a certain  Bank  upon the side of  Nilus  where they say of old  King Pharaoh's Daughter  found young  Moses  on a Bed of  Rushes  The Etymoli∣gy of the Word  Cairo  THE  Etymology  of  Cairo  is from the  Arabian  in which Language  El Caiairo  signifies  a Forcer  as to the Original  Foundation Founder  and  Hi∣storical Account  of this extensive City  Scaliger  and  Leo Africanus  with a hundred other Authors have so fully treated on those Subjects that I cannot judge it necessary to enlarge on such notorious Circumstan∣ces  IT only then remains that I shou'd mention the  Condition  of the Peo∣ple now Inhabiting  Grand Cairo  whom we found in  rolling Plenty  and the blest  Possession  of the richest Smiles of  Providential Nature  Trading greatly and encreasing  Wealth  with wonderful Dexterity  The Plenty of that City  nor can  Provi∣sions  of all kinds be any where more reasonably Sold than in the wellstor'd  Markets  of this spacious City  A way of hatching Eggs in Ovens  AMONG a thousand other Customs in some kind  Peculiar  to the People of  Grand Cairo  they have got a way of  hatching Eggs  by  Artificial Heat  which they perform by building certain  Rows of Ovens  of considera∣ble depth which they contrive on either side a Room one Row above ano∣ther within these  Ovens  they take care to lay a kind of  course rough Hemp  on which they spread a  Mat  and cover it with  Camel's Dung  or  that of Pidgeons  to considerable thickness so that by preserving  artful Heats  by  constant Fires  within the  Stoves  built under the abovenam'd  Ovens  they continue from the Month of  June  to the  declining of December  to produce vast quantities of  Chickens  from innumerable thousands of these  Eggs  which notwithstanding are observ'd to fall far short of  Nature  's unassisted  Efficacy  The Inhabi∣tants of  Cairo  famous for Instructing Beasts  I cou'd not help observing here that the Inhabitants of  Cairo  seem Possessors of a  quicker Genius  than our  Western People  in the Arts of teaching wonderful Performances to  Asses Goats Dogs Horses Mules  or any other Creatures void of Reason  A Story of a Goat  I have been shown a Man who kept a  Goat  so dex'trous in the poizing his  Instructed Body  that he cou'd not only stand upright upon a little Staff ten Inches long but climb'd with ease from one to stand upon a∣nother and proceeded without falling from that second to a third fourth fifth or more till he who own'd him was no longer capable of adding to the height by one  Staff  more  A pleasant Story of a Fidler and his Ass  A merry kind of Fellow of a  Moorish Extract  us'd to walk about the City with a sort of  Fiddle  and divert the  Passers by  with the re∣peated Airs of one dull Tune and in return for this 'tis true he did not beg Reward yet by a subtle  Stratagem  came off so well that he succeeded generally better than a  Downright Beggar  cou'd have reasonably hop'd for  THE  Ingenious Fellow  kept an  Ass  that always follow'd him from Street to Street without the trouble of his leading him along he carried on his back a little Budget which contain'd  Provisions  and the necessary Utensils his Master wanted in his daily Journeys  An Ass of good address  EVERY Man the  Fidler  met he bow'd his Body to by way of In∣formation that he hop'd for the Receipt of a small piece of Money from his grateful Liberality and still as often as the  Fidler  bow'd the  Ass  bow'd too as he had been instructed in so strange a manner and an  Air  so truly like himself that all who pass'd the Streets were mov'd to Laugh∣ter and not seldom  Gentlemen  have given the  Man  a Present for the Pleasure they receiv'd from the surprizing Prospect of his  Asse  's No∣velty who constantly with such another  Cringe  return'd the Compli∣ment  A cunning Practice  BUT if it chanc'd that any Man pass'd by regardless of the  Fidler  's Musick or Request nor thought it worth his while to pay him for his Harmony The  Ass  who cunningly came on behind at a considerable distance and observ'd all Passages but yet pretended not to mind 'em watch'd their coming and took care to snap a Piece from off the  Brit∣ches  of the unsuspecting Person or if he went by at too great distance on the other side the way he frequently turn'd back and bit out his Revenge as soon as he had overtaken him This pleasant Humour of the  Fidler  and his  Ass  became at last so very noted that Both the  Master's Profit  and the great  Respect  they shew'd the  Beast  grew daily more and more for really 'twas a dangerous Accident to meet 'em in the Street for such as hap'ned to be unprovided of a Charm to soften his Resentment  ANOTHER Trick they have of Getting Money is by training Camels up to dance about the Streets upon the Sounding of a Drum or any other Instrument of Musick This they do with admira∣abe quickness in the manner following  Their way of teaching Ca∣mels to Dance  THEY make a large square hollow Place on some Stone Pavement not unlike a Bath of such a depth that nothing let down thither can get out again but with the same Assistance he was first put in by Under this pav'd Floor consisting purposely of well experienc'd FireStone is built a Furnace into which they put a necessary quantity of Wood and heating it to what degree they please the Stones grow hot like some mild Oven  THEN they put the poor meek  Camel  into this square hollow heated as it is and standing round the edges of the Place begin to sound their Drums or other Instruments continuing so to do while the  Ʋnhoof'd  and  TenderFooted Camel  all impatient of the  Heat  first draws up one  Leg  then another changing swifter as the Heat encreasing burns his Feet with greater Anguish till at last he rears himself an end and capers nimbly on his  hinder Feet  as if he strove to imitate a  Dancer  A lazy kind of Living on the Labours of a Beast  THUS they use him till by frequent  Practice  the unwellcome  smart  has made impression on the  Creature's Memory  at which time they begin to lead him up and down the City where at certain Corners of the Noted Streets they suddenly strike up the Tunes they us'd to play which the poor Beast no sooner hears but dreading the HotStones he formerly was wont to feel when he had heard such  Musick  he begins to  Dance  and  Skip  about with strange Agility which soon becomes not only easy but even natural to his Performance and is daily practis'd by him to divert the  Common People  who assemble in great Crowds to see the Sport and pay the Owner a small Sum by  voluntary Contribution  The ancient  Memphis  THE ancient  Memphis  which has been by many Authors falsly thought the City now  Grand Cairo  was of old the Residence of  Egypts Monarchs  flourishing in all the  Grandeur  Wealth and Royalty cou'd Crown her Sons with here they kept their  Apis  and had once a stately  Temple  Sacred to his Worship here also stood the Glorious  Temple  of the  Goddess Venus  and a thousand Noble  Monuments  of  Power  and  Antiquity  all buried now and only showing their defac'd and broken Reliques Great in Ruin and  ama∣zingly Majestic  in those Heaps of Dust wherein now lie confus'dly mingled  Marble Pillars Stately Towrs  and  Batter'd Statues  of prodigious Workman∣ship  Why so call'd  THIS  ancient City  took the Name of  Memphis  from the Daughter of  King Ogdo  whom the  Poets  feign to have been  Ravish'd  by  Egyptian Nilus  in the Form of a large  Bull  Its Situation  It stood about five Miles to the  SouthEast  of the so celebrated  Pyramids of Egypt  and not above two Miles  full West  of  Nilus  distant from  Grand Cairo  sixteen Miles or somewhat over  Babylon  of  Egypt  why so nam'd  NOT distant far from the  Southside  of  Cairo  lie the  ruinated Ruins  of  Egyptian Babylon  which took that ancient Name from certain  Babylonian Colonies  who here assembling join'd their Parties in one Body and sol∣licited a Licence from the  King of Egypt  to lay out a considerable Sum of Mo∣ney in the Purchase of a Spot of Ground whereon to build a Place of Habi∣tation  THEY obtain'd a Grant from the  then Reigning Ptolemy  for the Pos∣session of the Land on which they built the Town I lately call'd accor∣ding to its  Old Denomination Babylon  which now has chang'd its Name to that of  MisulHetic  and is known to all the People of this Country by the  last nam'd Appellation  which I think may claim  Arabian Etymology  The Ruins of a stately Ci∣stern  AMONG the numerous  Ruins  whose confus'd Appearances amuse a Traveller there is at  Babylon  the broken remnant of a spacious  Cistern  for∣merly a mighty and stupendious Labour and receiving Water from the River  Nilus  to supply

Joseph  built in  Egypt  NOT far from hence stand certain  vast unweildy Structures  of Prodi∣gious Height and antique Figure all supported by a Number of  huge But∣tresses  and seeming to remain in that strange form they bear to tell the  Modern World  how their  Deceas'd Forefathers  built before 'em we were told by the  Egyptians  that these venerable Piles were those  Seven Granaries  or  Publick Magazines  which  Joseph  built at the Command of  Pharaoh  to pre∣serve the Product of the  Seven Years Plenty  which preceeded as long time of dreadfull  Famine  Repairs have fitted one or two for the same use at pre∣sent but the rest are so expos'd to the Inclemencies of Weather that they cannot be employ'd in such a Service  The Wonder∣full Extent and Prospect of  Egyptian  Ruins  THERE is not in the World a more uncommon Mortifying Scene than  Egypt  represents to every Stranger for above the space of Eighteen Miles on either side the  River Nilus  in this part of that depopulated Country where you cannot Sail a  Hundred Fathoms  but you must discover if you look about you the afflicting Marks of Misery and Desolation anci∣ent  Turrets  have disrob'd their Tops of

 But in lost  Athens  now an empty Name  NOW let us hasten from the  Ruins  of these fallen  Cities  to some more lasting Structures which in spite of  Time  have proudly stood  from Age to Age  and baffled strangely all the Shocks of  Age  or  Accident  CHAP XXXIV Of the  Pyramids  of  Egypt  and of several New Discoveries therein which were never yet Publish'd  The Pyramids of  Egypt  UPON the  Western  Side of the aforesaid  Memphis  near the Bor∣ders of the  Lybian Desart  stand those vast and tow'ring  Pyramids  which have so long amus'd the World with strange Reflections on the strong  Ambition  and vain glorious  Aim  of their aspiring  Foun∣ders  But before I enter on a full Description of their  Building Number Form  and  Situation  'twill not be amiss to tell my Reader that I look upon it as a needless trouble to repeat the many various Notions and receiv'd Opinions of the  ancient World  concerning the  Original Design  of such  Stu∣pendious Fabricks  What de∣sign'd for by their Foun∣ders  FOR it is now an uncontested and apparent Truth that they were first design'd as lasting  Sepulchres  wherein such  Monarchs  as might claim Interment in those lofty  Mausolaeums  were induc'd to hope they might out∣live their  Dissolutions  and continue known to  after Ages  by the striking Grandeur of their barbarous Monuments  TO this Opinion not to mention  Pliny Strabo Herodotus Diodorus Siculus  and many other  ancient Writers Lucan  seems to be a strict Adherer especially in his  eighth Book  where he exclaims against the base Injustice of  King Ptolemy  upon the account of  Pompey  's Murder in the following Verses  Lucan l    Ʋltima Lageae stirpis peritura{que} Proles  Degener incestae sceptris cessure sororis  Cum tibi sacrato Macedon servetur in antro  Et regum cineres extructo monte quiescant  Cum Ptolemaeorum manes seriem{que} pudendam  Pyramides claudant indina{que} Mausolea  Littora  Pompejum  feriunt truncus{que} vadosis  Huc illuc jactatur aquis  Degenerate  Last  of  Lagu's  Failing Race  To an  Incestuous Sister  yielding Place  Must  Pompey's Headless Body  Seawash'd o'er  Be dash'd by  swelling Surges  on the Shoar  Whilst  you  the  Macedonian  's Ashes keep  And  Royal Relicks  in tall Buildings sleep  While the base  Ptolemy  's Ignobler Race  Vast  Pyramids  Entomb and  Mausolaeums  grace  AND thus in many other Places the abovenam'd Author takes occa∣sion to repeat his Notions of the Use to which the Ancients put the  Pyra∣mids  One of the Worlds seven Wonders  'TIS  certain  and has been allow'd in every  Age  to whom these  mighty Piles  were known that they deserv'd the Character they ever bore of one of those Stupendious  Prodigies  which justly merited the Title of the  Worlds Seven Wonders  Their amazing height an  Old Greek Writer  nicely touches on as follows  An old  Greek  Writer on the Pyramids  In  faithless Stories  an Account is giv'n  That when  Titanian  Arms assaulted  Heav'n  Pelion  and  Ossa  from the Earth they drew  And at the Skys those  Rocky  Mountains threw  But those tall  Pyramids  near  Nilus  found  O'erlooking with  proud Heads  the distant Ground  Guide to the  Realms above  by sure degrees  And kiss the  golden Stars  which form the  Pleiades  The number of the Pyra∣mids  THE  Pyramids  extend themselves for many Miles along the  Desart  and are near Fourscore in Number most of which are small and inconsi∣derable in respect of  Three  which stand within a little space of one another and are built upon a certain  Hill of Sand  which covers  Rocks  of a stupen∣dious depth and wond'rous magnitude  The height and bulk of the Great Py∣ramid  THE  Altitude  in perpendicular of the most large and stately  Pyramid  is near five hundred  English Feet  but if we take the  Height  as it inclines ascending towards the Point we find it equal to the  Latitude  of its prodi∣gious  Basis  every way seven hundred Foot by moderate Computa∣tion  The second and a third  THE second  Pyramid  is equal to the first in  Height  and not above a Bow Shot distant from it but the  third  appearing scarce half finish'd leaves no room to make Comparisons and only gives us Cause to think by the Proportion it  at present  bears that had it been compleated as the others are it had been  higher far  and more polite than either of the for∣mer  The Stones of which the first is built  THE first Great  Pyramid  is built of vast and solid Stones which some pretend were brought from  Quarries  in the Mountains of  Arabia  but the gross Absurdity of that Opinion is extreamly evident from many Demon∣strations but by none more fully disanull'd than the  remaining Pieces of Sawn Stone  which lying up and down upon the  Sand  about the  Pyramid  sufficiently convince a thinking Man that they were dug no farther  off than from the solid  Rocks  not many Foot below the Surface of the Desart  SOME Stones and those not seldom met with near the top of this a∣mazing  Structure  are no less than five and twenty often thirty Foot in length and depth proportionable It is a wonderful but very pleasant and engaging Prospect to observe the  Art  and strange  Oeconomy  whereby this mighty  Pyramid  was built so loftily  To be ascen∣ded on the outside  You may ascend it gradually on the  external Sides  or  Steps  which lead you safely to the  Summit  of the  Buil∣ding  The Archi∣tecture of the Pyramids  ABOUT the bottom of the  Pyramid  there runs a strong  degree  of Stone near five Foot high and four in breadth upon the  inner Edges  of which round Degree is plac'd another somewhat smaller upon that a third yet smaller than the second on that third a fourth still leaning  in∣wards  more and more as it advances in its  Altitude  and growing less and less till at the top thereof it forms a  Square  consisting of  three several Stones  close knit together in the compass of about fifteen or sixteen Foot of  English Measure  The Form thereof and number of the Steps  THUS are the four Sides for I shou'd have inform'd you that the  Pyramid  is  Quadrilateral  encompass'd by above two hundred of these vast  De∣grees  or  Steps  of different Height and Magnitude which appear like long and narrow  Walking Places  but are now so much decay'd by  Time  and  Weather  that it is a dangerous Trial to attempt ascending but in cer∣tain Places where the  Stones  continue firm unbroken and of promising Appearance  The Founder of the greatest Pyramid  THIS  Pyramid  is said to have been built by  Cheops King of Egypt  who by that Amusement kept his Subjects from the dangerous  Rust  of a  Rebel∣lious Idleness  and erected for himself a  Mausolaeum  so prodigious that it has already stood almost four thousand Years and may according to the Dictates of undoubted probability continue near as long again before 'tis ruin'd  How long in Building  SO vast was the  Command  and great the  Labour  requisite to carry on so strange an Undertaking that for the space of twenty Years there were employ'd about the building it above three hundred threescore thousand constant Workmen  The second Pyramid  THE Stones whereof the second  Pyramid  is built are  white  and  shining  not to be ascended on the  outside  which is very smooth and has its sides extreamly equal  By whom built  This  Pyramid  as  Herodotus  and some other Writers tell us was Originally built by  Cephron  Brother to  King Cheops  the Great  Founder  of the former  The third Pyramid  THE third  unfinish'd Pyramid  is built of a fine hard bright white and clearer kind of  Stone  than either of the rest which some  tho' groundlessly  affirm to have been brought from the remotest Mountains of the sultry  Aethiopia  'TIS more than probable this Fable sprang from those  Old Writers  Observations of a mighty quantity of  Theban Marble  not unlike the Pro∣duct of an  Aethiopian Quarry  which now lies in heaps not far from this third  Pyramid  and with which Stone perhaps they anciently design'd to cover it but were prevented by some Cause which  God  alone is capable of telling us  The several Persons said to be its Founders  THERE go almost an Hundred different Stories of the Founding of this  Pyramid  some say 'twas built by  Macerinus  Son to  Cheops King of Egypt  some say by  Dorica  a  Courtezan  or  Harlot  some again make men∣tion of another famous  Strumpet Aesop  's  Fellow Slave  call'd  Rhodope  who when grown Rich by frequent  Prostitution  built this  Pile  to eternize her Memory  A Pleasant Story of the Building a  Pyramid  ANOTHER Story gives a strange Romantic Air to the Original hereof and tells us how the latenam'd  Rhodope  Inhabiting the City of  Naucretis  went one Day to  Wash  and  Bath  herself in a delightfull  Fountain  in the Middle of her Garden and that leaving all her  Cloathes  upon the Verdant  Brink  a sharpEy'd  Eagle  seiz'd upon her  Shooe  and bearing it aloft Flew out of Sight nor staid a Moment till he came to  Memphis  where he drop'd it in the Lap of  Amasis  then  King of Egypt  who surpriz'd at the Extraordinary event and pleas'd extreamly with the shape and Beau∣ty of the  Lady  's  Shooe  gave Orders instantly that strict enquiry shou'd be made about his  Kingdom  for the Owner of it who at last was found and being brought to  Memphis  was immediately declar'd the  Wife  of  Amasis  with whom she Reign'd for many Years as  Queen of Egypt  and upon her Death receiv'd a Stately Mark of his Affection to her Person in the Orders which he gave for the erecting over her so fine a  Mo∣nument  The Remoter  Pyramids  THERE are but very few of the Remoter  Pyramids  whose forms or magnitude deserve the Trouble of a Strangers Observation yet have all been closely shut  from Age to Age  whereby the wisest Writers of  Antiquity  itsself have been enabled to report no more than what they  guess'd at Ran∣dam  or receiv'd  Traditionally  from the vulgar notions  Shut close in all Ages  I know not why the Entrances of all the  Pyramids  the great one only still excepted were originally clos'd against the view of an Adventurous Curiosity nor by what strange means they have so many Ages 'scap'd Discovery from the Ingenious  Scrutinies  and nice  Inspections  of our later  Ancestors  or the Refin'd and more Polite Inhabitants of  Egypt  when con∣verted to the  Doctrine  of the  Christian Faith  The Supersti∣tion of the People the cause thereof  BUT 'twill be nothing difficult to guess the Reason of their being still kept close from the Establishment of  Turkish  Government in that subvert∣ed Country for as the ancient Nature of the  true Egyptians  was defil'd extreamly with the  Mud  of  Superstition  and exceeding prone to look on  Omens  and all  Insignificant  and  Idle  Observations as the sure  Proclaimers  of  Portentous Prodigies  that senseless  Vice  or  Humour  has encreas'd  of late  to  double Folly  by the Curs'd  Commixture  of their own  erroneous Principles  and the  Delusive Superstitious Tenets  of the fond  Mahometans  The Madness of Bigotted Zeal  THIS Illcontriv'd  Conjunction  of Ignoble Follies kept back Inclina∣tion to the search of Knowledge and to such  amazing Height  did their  Resentment  fly when any Man of whatsoever  Quality  he was presum'd to offer at an Entrance of the  Pyramids  that the desires which some  Bashaws  of  Cairo  have thought fit to mention upon that account have caus'd such  Mutinies  in the distracted Nation as the  Sword of Justice  was too weak to  Pacifie  NOR will it be unpleasant to the Reader to inform himself of the  Va∣lidity  of their  Traditions  by reflecting  seriously  upon the following noti∣on which  till very lately  was esteem'd as  Orthodox  A pleasant Notion of the  Egyptians  re∣lating to  Mo∣ses  and the Magicians  THEY told such  Travellers  as ask'd them why the Entrances of eve∣ry  Pyramid  but one were clos'd so strongly That the  Sorcerer Moses  for it seems they so distinguish'd  that Illustrious Prophet  having wasted  Egypt  by  Ten Grievous Plagues  their Great  Magicians  vainly strove to check the Mischiefs he design'd and  did  them  The Ten Plagues of  Egypt  impri∣son'd in the Pyramids  BUT at last when tedious Practices of vain Experiments convinc'd them plainly of their want of Power to stand unshock'd against the  Mira∣cles  the  Hebrew  shew'd them they resolv'd to try another way and fin∣ding it impossible to hurt the Person of the  hated Moses  they invented strange and admirable  Talismans  whereon by fixing certain  Hieroglyphic Characters  and shutting them securely up within the  Pyramids  they in∣stantly found means to free themselves from all those  Plagues  superior Pow∣er had brought upon them  AND hence the Superstitious Natives of this Country believing those vast Piles lock'd in their Miseries prohibited the opening any of the  Pyramids  least on admission of  excluded Air  the Charms upon the  Talismans  shou'd lose their Power and all the  Plagues  rush out again and overwhelm the Nation with impetuous Violence  A resolute Bashaw of  Cairo  HOWEVER notwithstanding the Antiquity and Strength of this  Egyptian Superstition  some Years since when I was happily at  Cairo  there arriv'd a new  Bashaw  from  Constantinople  a Man of an uncommon Share of Courage and Ambition eagerly desirous of encreasing  Knowledge  and with pleasure snatching every Opportunity which offer'd a Temptation to his swelling  Curiosity  THIS Man who knew full well the Power he was Master of and scorn'd to fear the  Insults  of a poor unthinking  Mob  which he was sent to Govern fram'd a bold and sudden Resolution to inform himself immedi∣ately by the convincing Proofs of  Ocular  Demonstration of the various Wonders and surprizing Strokes of Art which he had often heard discours'd of on occasionally mentioning the  Pyramids  of  Egypt  A Journey to the Pyramids  NO sooner was his Resolution spread abroad than he perceiv'd a thou∣sand Marks of  Discontent  and  Anger  in the Common People but despising those effects of  Ignorance  and  Folly  he prepar'd convenient Instruments of every kind and ordering a necessary number of his Servants to attend his Person took a Journey to these famous  Pyramids  in order to observe the nature of their Buildings and procure himself a great and lasting Satisfacti∣on in the wish'd for Pleasure of some new  Discoveries  NOR fell he short in his expected ends of going thither and as the Dis∣coveries he made were such as never yet were told the World it will not be unwelcome since my self and five more  Christian Travellers  were suffer'd to accompany him if I here particularize the  gradual  advan∣ces which with curious notice of the most  minute  or  great  re∣mark  then  led us leisurely thro' every part of that stupendious Fa∣brick  The Entrance of the great∣est Pyramid  ARRIVING at the Place where stands the great and first nam'd  Pyramid  we all ascended a steep Hill of Sand near forty Foot in height upon the  Northern  side thereof which brought us to the Entrance a  Dark Hole  not four Foot broad nor in its height exceeding such a Measure so that it appear'd design'd for the reception of a Stone to close that Mouth and so prevent  the Times to come  from aiming at the Knowledge of those  silent Mansions  of imperious Death whose undisturb'd and darksom Hollows kept the Bodies of departed Majesty  A noisome narrow Pas∣sage  WE enter'd after certain  Guides  who undertook our Conduct thro' this dismal Passage and descended as upon the steepness of some narrow Hill almost one hundred Foot before we reach'd the bottom and were all that while oblig'd to  stoop  or rather  crawl  along with  Torches  in our Hands  an∣noy'd  extreamly by the suffocating heat and closeness of the Place but more by certain black and dreadful  Batts  a kind of Bird whose Shape is fright∣ful and her Wings like Leather flying  up  and  down  and oftentimes with dangerous Violence repuls'd by striking on the Heads or Faces of such  Travellers  as entering  there  must necessarily encounter them  An open space  THE  bottom  of this  close  and  gloomy  way admits us to a Place conside∣rably broad and of an height which frees us from the great uneasiness of stooping for a Passage all the Stones about this space are broken and irre∣gular but yet appear to have been render'd so by force because not an∣swerable in Proportion or Politeness to the universal Harmony which crowns the other Building  The first Gal∣lery of the Pyramid  FROM  hence  we were oblig'd to clamber up an huge and massy kind of Stone near ten Foot high which brought us to the entrance of the low∣est  Gallery  whose Pavement of a polish'd white and shining Marble gent∣ly rises with a smooth  acclivity  the breadth thereof was near five Foot the height a little more the Sides and Roof were flagg'd with Stones of an unpolish'd rough and softer Substance than the Marble of the Pavement the height of this first Gallery exceeded rather than fell short of six score Foot of  English  Measure  THIS  Gallery  was terminated by a very thick and solid Wall thro' which a  Hole  about the bigness of the first by which we entred to the  Py∣ramid  admitted us directly to another  Gallery  of very fine and stately  Workmanship  but  in its length  inferior to the former  A very dread∣ful horrid Well  hence we entred on an open space which led us to the Brink of a most dreadful  Well  a strange Descent of such  forbidding horror  in its black appearance that the very ap∣prehensions of its  Depth  and  Danger  has for many Ages frightned the desire of Curious Men from  even aiming  at a further Satisfaction than by passing hastily along its edges to attain the entrance of another Passage leading to Apartments which I shall describe  hereafter  Here we stop'd and by direction from the  Grand Bashaw  who was  himself  amongst us with a lighted Torch surrounded the Descent whose Mouth was near three Yards in its  Diameter  The Bottom how disco∣vered  THE Light occasion'd by so many Torches was by far too weak to penetrate the thickness of this gloomy Place so that finding it impossible by  their  Assistance to perceive the  bottom  of the  Well  we stood by we con∣triv'd to cast in certain Balls of  Oakam  dipt in  Pitch  or other fit  bituminous  Ingredients to prepare them for the  blazing Offices  they might be put to  THESE Balls once set on fire and thrown down discover'd at the bottom of the Pit a strange disorder'd heap of  Sand  and  Rubbish  it was near ten Yards in  depth  and had no Stairs whereby Descent had formerly been made but certain Hollows cut like  PidgeonHoles  quite round the inside of the Well directed those who would think fit to venture down to use promiscuously their Hands and Feet and so enable them to satisfy their Curiosity without great danger to their Persons  How clear'd from Rubbish  REVOLVING Ages of continued Time had Rob'd this  Well  of a considerable  Depth  by filling up great part with Sand and Stones by Accident thrown thither but this weak Obstacle the Resolute  Bashaw  found present means to render void by making several of his Men de∣scend and Dig away whate'er they met with Stone excepted which by some above was instantly drawn up in little Baskets and by those means a free Passage open'd to the solid Bottom of this  Rocky Hollow  A new Disco∣very at the Bottom of a Well  THERE the  Well  grows vastly larger and in  Circular extent  is dug on every side much deeper in the same degree  to use an ordinary Comparison  as is the Body of a common Bottle to the Neck thereof this great Additio∣nal extent of space is Grac'd far rather than supported by a Stately Cir∣cle of fine Pillars of  Thebaic Marble  or at least a Stone not much unlike it And in the Center of the Circle which those Pillars form there stands an ancient  Monument  the  Tomb  perhaps of that great  Architect  who built the  Pyramid  A Tomb found there  THE  Tomb  exceeds not much six  Foot  in  Length  its  Breadth  is hard∣ly four appearing hewn from the  Main Rock  but cover'd with a flat of Polish'd Marble on the top whereof as on the sides of the whole  Tomb  were strangely carv'd a Thousand  Hieroglyphic Images  and  odd De∣vices  A Wooden Coffin in it  WE found it no great labour to remove the  Stone  which cover'd the  Se∣pulchre  and were much amaz'd when contrary to expectation we beheld therein a  Wooden Coffin  or at least appearing to be  Wood  by  Touch  and  Figure  UPON the  Coffin Lid  were represented in a kind of  Inlaid gilt Work  the distinct and several Figures following  Hieroglyphics  on the Coffin Lid  AN  Eagle  first appear'd upon a sort of Throne supported by four Wing'd Faces not unlike the notions we conceive of  Cherubims  but by their swelling Cheeks and blustering Breath sent forth four different ways I rather guess they were at first design'd to represent the four great Winds of  Heaven  THE  Eagle  with severe and sullen aspect lookt directly at a Man who held in his  Right  Hand  a pair of Compasses  and had his  Left  extend∣ed in a form which represented him demanding Mercy while half sinking in an opening Gulph which loosening likewise the Foundations of a  Towring Pyramid  which stood before him  that also  seem'd just Tumb∣ling after him kick'd downward by the Foot of an old Man whose  Right  Hand held a  Scyth  while with his  Left  he drew along a  Cloud  which he appear'd designing to throw over both the  Man  and  Pyra∣mid  thereby to cover their appearance in a thick obscurity  The meaning of them  NOW among the many  Hieroglyphic Images  whereby the  Old Egypti∣ans  represented  GOD  they often chose the  Eagle  in regard to the  sharp Sightedness  that Bird is fam'd for as an Emblem to express his Attri∣bute of sure  Omniscience  as the four Winds  there  plac'd were meant to represent the vast extent of his unbounded Power over every Cor∣ner of the World the Winds can blow upon  THE  Eagle  's looking so severely on the falling Man may probably denote  God's  anger at the  Pride  and  Vanity  wherewith he had indulg'd his Merits on the Building that huge Fabrick which appear'd before him  The Authors Opinion whose the Tomb was  for I take this sinking Man to have been done for the Great  Architect  of the  Egyptian Pyramids  THE tumbling of the  Pyramid  I guess to signify that tho' the Builder perish'd first yet even the strongest Master Pieces of his artful Labour  must succeed him in a sure tho' slower Downfall and to shew that no∣thing tho' of never so stupendious Strength and Grandeur can resist the Shocks of powerful Time  Old Time himself  there represented spurning down the Building spreads a Cloud of Darkness over it to prove that he is not alone enabled to destroy the pompous Pageantries of Human Ostentati∣on but to bury  even the Memory  of their o'erthrown Existence in a black Obscurity  SO that if I may be allow'd to have guess'd right in the  Interpretation  of these  Hieroglyphic Figures  they'll be found to signify as much as if in  Com∣mon Characters  we should set down the following Sentences  The Hiero∣glyphic Word for Sense Translated  Almighty God whose undisputed Power extends it self to  East North West  and  South  and every Corner of the spacious Ʋniverse Sees and despises Human Insolence for while Men vainly think to Raise themselves beyond Mortality by some proud Ʋndertaking they are overthrown by time and buried with their Labours in a dusky Cloud of ever dark Oblivion  FROM these  perswasive Circumstances  I profess my self induc'd to think this Monument contain'd the Body as I said before of him who built this  wond'rous Pyramid    The Coffin broke open  But perhaps the Reader will be more inclinable to that Opinion when I tell him that the  Coffin  by Command of the  Bashaw  was with great difficulty forcibly  broke open  by the Blows of  PickAxes  and that we found therein the undiminish'd Body of a perfect Man  Embalm'd  and wrap'd about with many thousand folds of  Aromatic Searcloth  like the  Mummies  which I shall at large describe in the seven and thirtieth Chap∣ter  A Mummy found in it with Hiero∣glyphics on his Breast  THOSE Folds wherewith his Breast was cover'd seem'd to have been  varnish'd over  with a lasting kind of  glewy Liquor  upon which were re∣presented all the various sorts of Instruments us'd of old by the Professors of encourag'd  Architecture  WHEN we had seen as much as we coul'd possibly discover in the  Tomb  the Body was again enclos'd as it had been before and the  above∣nam'd Marble Cover  plac'd again upon the Sepulchre  A further search of new Discoveries  from whence we went about the  Circle  in the midst of which we found the  Monument  to try if we could find no Passage that might lead us on to new Discoveries of some∣thing which we  then  began to form strong hopes of meeting with  Moral Re∣flections  METHOUGHTS the strange disorder'd heaps of  Dust  and  broken Stones  o'er which we walk'd and the uncertainty we had of knowing when those massy Piles were built and to what  Founder  they have ow'd their  Origin  then struck me deeply with a melancholy Thought and often brought to my remembrance the Reflections of an  Old Greek Poet  on the arbitrary Power which  Time  's Prerogative entitles him to exercise o'er  frail Mortality  The length of Time shocks Monuments of Stone  Even  I'm it self  must  Time  's Dominion own  All Things on Earth his Powerful Rule obey  And fall before his Arm in one appointed way  A Stone Door  WE walk'd  sometime  about the Place and with our  Torches  narrowly in∣spected every thing we pass'd by till  at last  we spy'd  a Door of Stone  so closely shut and joyning with the Wall that 'twas not easily distinguish'd from it  here  believing we should meet with somewhat worth our Obser∣vation several Men were order'd to come forward and employ their  PickAxes  and  other Instruments  in forcing open this discover'd Place which seem'd to offer us no other hopes of gaining Entrance  Broke open  'TWAS not without much difficulty that the  Arts  they us'd at last prevail'd the Door flew open with a mighty violence and caus'd a sort of  frightful Sound  as sudden as a  Thunder Clap  but what was most remarka∣ble was that the  Hinges  upon which it turn'd were all of  Stone  the Joynts contriv'd with an amazing Ingenuity to knit together  close  and  admirably  held by  certain strong and clumsy Iron Pins  whereby they were for ever hinder'd from all possibility of  accidental loosning  Dangerous Vapours  I know not how so dry a place as this contain'd such damp and noxious  Vapours  as at the surprizing opening of the  Door abovenam'd  presently ex∣tinguish'd  several Torches  and struck  dead  for some considerable time  two sturdy Labourers  who were foremost of the Company  FOREWARN'D by the Example of these Men we  cautiously  pro∣ceeded to inspect the entrance of a  dismal Cavity  and that we might the better see the nature of the Place cast in before us many of the  Balls  I late∣ly spoke of which by flaming greatly did not only clear the Prospect of that  gloomy Passage  but diffus'd an efficacious kind of  Warmth  How dissipa∣ted  which dis∣sipating soon the hurtful Vapours or unwholesome Closeness of the Place encourag'd us to enter with our  lighted Torches  The Discove∣ry of many subterraneous Chambers  WE advanc'd with equal  Pleasure  and  Amazement  thro' a very lofty broad arch'd way on either side whereof were hewn  Elaborately  from the solid Rock great numbers of square Chambers every one of which had  small low Benches  carv'd quite round it and in some appear'd large  Niches  of an exquisite Contrivance but  convincing  or at least  inducing  us to think they were design'd for  other Ʋses  by their not retaining any Marks of ha∣ving  ever  held the Burden of a  Statue  Hieroglyphic Figures  UPON the Sides Floor Roof and the abovenam'd Benches we discover'd plainly  certain ancient Hieroglyphics  most of which were  unintel∣ligible  or at least extreamly  difficult  to all our Apprehensions  SOME  however  I took pains to think upon and flatter'd my Belief with the Opinion that I could Interpret their  Significations  and among the rest it may not be unpleasant should I mention  One  for the  Diversion  of the Reader  First Figure  NEAR half a Foot above the Bench the  Hieroglyphic  took beginning in the figure of an  Infant  sleeping in a Cradle on the lowermost Stair of  Ten  which reaching to the Roof upon the uppermost supported an  Old Man  extreamly feble in his Aspect bending with the Weight of  Age  and  Misery  and seeming ready to  fall down  and  die  immediately  Second Fi∣gure  A Man who seem'd to be of  Middle Age  was represented on the sixth or seventh Step his  left Hand  full of certain  Chains  in number equal to the Stairs he had ascended to the respective  ends  of each long Chain were fastned many things like  Globes  of different sizes his  right Hand  seem'd with eagerness employ'd in grasping many other Chains as he as∣cended further  These Fi∣gures what design'd to re∣present  THE Stairs which as I said before were  Ten  in number were in∣tended as I guess'd to represent the  Ten Great Stages  of our human Life which very rarely goes beyond  one hundred Years  The Child  there  sleeping in a Cradle on the lowest Stair I take to signify the ten first Years of  help∣less Infancy  The  Weak Old Man  was  Lifes great Period  and the utmost Age of  frail Mortality  THE Man of  Middle Age  upon the sixth or seventh Stair was  nothing  but an  Emblem  of our Mortal Life 'twixt  Theescore Years  and  Seventy  The Chains with  Globes  of different sizes fastned to one end which he endea∣vour'd eagerly to grasp as he ascended signifi'd no more than that a Man who Travels toward  Old Age  should make good use of  every Moment  in collecting  Knowledge  and retaining it with resolution  How the old  Egyptians  in Hierogly∣phics repre∣sented Wis∣dom  for the  Old Egypti∣ans  represented  Wisdom  by the  Hieroglyphic Figure  of a  Globe  or  Circle  to de∣note that it was boundless and the different Magnitudes of all those Balls express'd the great variety of  Worth  in  Arts  and  Sciences  THE Application therefore of this  Hieroglyphical Contrivance  seems  conspicuous  to my  probably mistaken Judgement  which by putting the above∣nam'd Thoughts together fram'd immediately the following Interpretati∣on of the  dubious Emblem  The Inter∣pretation of the Hiero∣glyphic  He who will hope to reach a good Old Age and bear the Weak∣nesses and great Infirmities 'tis always subject to must never fail in e∣very Stage of Life he passes thro' to gather  Wisdom  and improve his Mind with  Learning  and  Morality  Moral Re∣flections  AND excellently Good is the Advice this admirable  Hieroglyphic  gives Mankind how heavily and full of sorrow sits  Old Age  on that unhappy Wretch who in the fruitless Journey of his  growing Life  has still omitted all his Opportunities of laying up the  Treasure  of a serious  Contemplation  or  im∣prov'd Capacity  whereby to soften the unpleasant  harshness  of the Burthen  Time mispent  has laid upon his Shoulders  BUT the  Wiser Man  who never knew to live in vain but daily ga∣thers an  encreasing Stock  of  Learning  and  Discretion  to  enrich  the dry and barren  Soil Old Age  must bring him to will never feel the Stings of  Igno∣rance  and discontented  Solitude  but when he finds himself decay'd in  Strength of Body  can reflect with  Solon  on the  Vertues  of his  Mind  and ba∣nish  Grief  in the transporting Repetition of the following Sentence  A Saying of  Solon  'Tis true I grow  more Old  but if I do  As I wax  Older  I wax  Wiser  too  THE Reader must not blame me for presuming to  Interpret  the above∣nam'd  Hieroglyphics  since the wonderful variety of  Fancy  they afford a Sub∣ject for gives  scope  enough to every Man's Opinion and the  dubious  Mea∣ning cloak'd in their Disguise may very easily  mislead  our  Judgment  A Passage stop'd with Rubbish  AFTER we had pass'd with  gradual  Advances from one Chamber to another we arriv'd  at last  at what repuls'd our eager Curiosity tho'  pro∣bably  it was not  anciently  the uttermost Extent of those strange  subterraneous Hollows  there we found the Passage quite  choak'd up  with  Stones  and  Rubbish  nor cou'd force an  entrance  any farther tho' we zealously endeavour'd by  an universal Labour  to remove the Obstacle  Several Opi∣nions on the use the Ca∣verns were design'd for  GOD only knows how these vast heaps of  Dirt  and  Ruins  came Origi∣nally  there  and what remains  unseen  behind them possibly there may be found in  future Times  some wonderful Conveyances for  Water  as the com∣mon Notion seems inclin'd to credit or  perhaps  these Chambers were de∣sign'd of old for  Tombs  or  probably  they were the  Habitations  of a kind of  ancient Priests  who liv'd the Life of a  secluded Votary  or  melancholy Hermit  in or near the doleful  Monument  of some Great  Prince  or Man of  Honour  and had all the  Necessaries  of their  Life  provided  daily  by the  Legacies  of the  Deceas'd  The Author's own Opinion  INDEED I am the most inclinable to a  Belief  of this last  Guess  for many Reasons  two especially  the first because the numerous  Hieroglyphics  carv'd upon the Rocks have been such as seem to 'em fansy'd for the  Con∣templation  of  Religious Persons  and because had all those Places been design'd for the conveying  Water  from the  River Nilus Hieroglyphic  had been cer∣tainly a very  odd  and  needless Ornament  Its Reasons  AND  secondly  because  without the Pyramids  in many Places still remain the  rows of Caves hewn  deeply in the Rocks where  formerly  the  superstitious Priests  of  Egypt  us'd to dwell employ'd in several different Services in the  Romantic  Offices of their  Religion  WHATE'ER they be we found the utmost of our  Labour  vainly spent in hopes of gaining further  Knowledge  so return'd again the way we had descended till we came to the beforenam'd  rugged Place  which brought us to the  brink  of the  deep Well  I have been speaking of  A Passage leading to a Square with∣in the Pyra∣mid  ASCENDED from the  Well  we went directly forward and exactly in a Line with the beforenam'd  second Gallery  we entred a small  Neck  or  Passage  scarce five Yards in length and very narrow this admitted us to a large  Square  a little  finer  than the  former  but in  Magnitude  not far exceeding it the  Stones  whereof 'tis built are so extreamly large and yet so wonder∣fully closely Jointed that the nicest Eye can scarce distinguish where abouts they join together and it is the  mighty Size  of those prodigious Stones and the Politeness of their  Workmanship  that yields such cause for Travellers  A∣mazement  when they see the  Fabrick  of those towring  Pyramids  The dimensi∣ons of the Square  WE found this Square no less than near an hundred Foot and thence proceeded to a  vaulted Chamber  sixteen Foot in height near twenty long and eighteen broad or thereabouts the  Stones  which flagg the angled Roof of this large Chamber are of  admirable smoothness  and  surprizing mag∣nitude  but all the  Walls  are plaister'd over with a  Limy Substance  wonder∣fully  firm  and not inferior even to Stone it self for its appearance or dura∣tion  A Niche in the Wall  JUST  equidistant  from the  Eastern Angles  of this Room and on that side thereof we found a kind of hollow  Niche  which seem'd  at first  to have been made to hold some  Statue  as an  Ornament  or  Idol  but upon a  nice Inspection  we imagin'd it was possible there might be something of a Passage into other  undiscover'd Chambers  of the  Pyramid  whereupon the Men had Orders to endeavour  by their Instruments  to find it out  A new Des∣cent dis∣cover'd  BY Thrusting in their  Iron Betties  where they thought the  Joints  a little of the  Widest  they found means to force out a  large Stone  which stop'd a  Hole  near  three Foot Square  and open'd to the view of all the Com∣pany a  narrow shelving Passage  leading downwards with a  dismal Gloomi∣ness  And Enter'd  WE Entred and Descended strangely struck with  Gravelike Smells  and  dusty odours  there was cut a Passage down by certain Stairs whose Winding Turns and  Labyrinth of changes  led us on with wonderfull sur∣prize and eager curiosity till we imagin'd we had gone almost the Height of all the  Pyramid  below its Bottom All the way was  Hewn  laboriously from the  Rock  it self and commonly so very low and narrow that but one cou'd possibly go down  fullbreasted  and  that one  was forc'd to stoop with incommodious Forwardness  A Vaulted Passage un∣der Ground  THE Bottom of these  Stairs  at last admitted us to a low  Vaulted Pas∣sage  strait but narrow which continu'd in one form for a considerable way together letting in a  Glimmering Light  which look'd like  Day  thro certain little Holes of almost undistinguishable size and Workman∣ship  A strange As∣cent  IN all the Horrour and Amazement possible from the surprizing odd∣ness of the Place we Walk'd in we proceeded till we found the strait∣ness of the Passage terminated by another  Winding StairCase  leading  upwards  in as strange a manner as the other  downwards  The Passage Clos'd  WE Ascended here and found no difference in Form or Magnitude be∣tween this Passage and the former till we perceiv'd it clos'd by cer∣tain  Massy  Stones above our Heads and several other on each side the  StairCase  HERE we stop'd and for a while amus'd our selves with strange  Re∣flections  on the Nature of the Place and  Thoughts  which way we might get out without returning the same Road we came some Passage out we were assur'd there was else cou'd not comprehend the use of all those steps by which we had ascended  A Moveable Stone Disco∣ver'd  AT last some Men belonging to the  Great Bashaw  and famous Masters of the Art of  Architecture  as in Fashion in the  Eastern Countries  looking earnestly about the Place perceiv'd one  Stone  much smaller than the rest and by the Application of their  Irons  after many  fruitless efforts  found it stir and by  repeated Labours  so prevail'd at last that they quite lifted it from out the Place it stood in and by forcible addition of a doubled strength quite thrust it from the Hole it stop'd  A Storm of Sand  BUT we had little reason to be pleas'd with this success for in the very Moment that the Stone was lifted out there Showr'd down on us such  Impetuous Tides  of  Rolling Sand  that in the space of  half a Minute  we were almost  Buried Quick  and  wholly overwhelm'd  with its amazing violence  NO sooner was this  Sandy Storm  and our surprize thereat abated but we open'd all our  Eyes  and found our selves  half Swallow'd  by it yet those Men who stood the nearest to the  Hole  perceiv'd it wider at the Top than Bottom and the Stone which fill'd it being likewise so had serv'd to stop it up effectually and till then prevented all that Sand which lay upon it from a possibility of Entrance  The Author and his Com∣pany rise without the  Pyramid  ON either side the  Hole  and  Rock below it  there were cut  Square Nooks  wherein by thrusting Hands and Feet a Man without great difficulty might ascend and by those means we all got up in order as we stood and were beyond belief surpriz'd not only to  behold  an open  Sky  which plainly shew'd us that we were without the  Pyramid  but to  perceive  our selves within a Spacious  Hollow  on the lofty Head  of that great  Rock  which  Pliny  and the other Writers of Antiquity distin∣guish by the Name of  Sphynx  Plinys  Opini∣on of the  Sphynx  THE Author just abovenam'd wou'd perswade us to believe that 'twas the  Sepulchre  of  Amasis King of Egypt  and of his Opinion are most Modern Writers who have had occasion in their Books to mention it  The Authors Dissent from it  FOR my part I must own my Inclination leads me to dissent from the belief that it was ever meant for that Employment I am rather Tempted to imagine it was anciently an Idol from the hollow of whose Head the Priests deceiv'd the Common People as they thought con∣venient  And the Causes there∣of  AND indeed to what end else were those strange  Subterraneous Pas∣sages  contriv'd which lead from the  Great Pyramid  and  Caves adjoining  for∣merly the Habitations of a  Superstitious Priesthood  Why but for this cause shou'd they have Carv'd the  Rock  'tis made of like an  Aethiopian Virgin  or why else have made the Head so hollow and the Passages thereto so very Secret  Why call'd a  Sphynx  'TWAS call'd a  Sphynx  because from the Breasts upwards it was said to represent a  Virgin  and a  Lyon  from the Bosom downwards If there ever was the  Lyons  shape belonging to it Hills of Sand have cover'd its Appearance for there now remains no more above the Surface than the Head and Neck and something of Foundation which those Men who please may take for Shoulders  Its Situation and Dimensi∣ons  IT stands on the  East  side of the great  Pyramid  but very little di∣stant from it its Height exceeds not  Seventy Foot  and is defac'd ex∣treamly by the violence of those  Bigotted Turks  who hating Images be∣lieve it meritorious to abolish the Remembrance of their very Be∣ing  How decay'd by time  THE  Arabs  call it  Abulholhon  and express a Satisfaction in the hopes they have conceiv'd that it will shortly fall by reason of the Weakness of the Neck decay'd extreamly by the Shocks of Time and fre∣quent  Tempests  from the  Neighb'ring Desarts  whence the  Winds  from time to time blow storms of  Sand  and thence came that which so unwellcomely invaded us when first we forc'd the Passage open  They return to the  Pyra∣mid  WE plac'd the Stone as we had found it by the strength of certain Men whom the  Bashaw  oblig'd to stay above on purpose and reen∣ter by the common way the  Pyramid  we were returning to we fast∣ned in the  Stone  belonging to the  Niche  and going back to the above∣nam'd  Well  began to climb another Passage not far from it  A Gracefull Gallery  THIS brought us to a Gracefull  Gallery  of six and twenty Foot in height still rising with a very smooth but somewhat steep and difficult Acclivity This  Gallery  is almost Seven Foot broad and Bench'd with solid Seats of Stone near two Foot high on either side and Flagg'd with Stone politely join'd and of a Magnitude almost surpassing Credit 'Tis in Length  one Hund∣red Fifty and odd Feet  and leads where it Terminates to two Large round  Stately Chambers opening into one another and indented Square and certain Nooks which seem to have been form'd for sitting Places  A Chamber with a Tomb in it  HENCE a  square  and  Marble Passage  brought us to the Entrance of the middle Room the loftiest most amazing and prodigious  Building  of the  Pyramid  the  Chamber  which contains the  Tomb  of him who built it thought as I have said before to be  King Cheops  an  Egyptian Mo∣narch  The amazing dimensions of the Chamber  THE length of this vast Room is five and thirty  English Feet  the breadth a little more than seventeen the height within an Inch or two of twenty and the Sides Roof Floor and every Part thereof flagg'd richly with fine glittering Tables of  Thebaick Marble  so prodigiously extensive that the Place is roof'd by  nine great Squares thereof  and all the Sides are flagg'd by six vast rows of equal Magnitude and Beauty inexpressibly surprizing  Description of the Tomb  A little distant from the  Western Side  of this great Chamber stands the  Monument  I just now mention'd 'tis about seven Foot in length three deep and thereabouts in breadth 'tis empty and uncover'd and consists of one entire  Piece  of admirable  Porphyry  which being struck by any  Sword∣hilt Stone  or other  solid  Body yields a  sound  not much inferior to the  Tone  of some  great Bell  in Christian Churches  A further Passage  FROM hence a Passage leads you steeply to some  other Chumbers  none deserving a particular Description and continuing to ascend as far as pos∣sible we search'd in vain for more  Discoveries  and at last descended by the way we came  How the Top is to be as∣cended  THE  Top  must be ascended from  without  and is not what it seems to be by reason of the distance from below a  Point  but an exact and perfect  Square  of fourteen Foot which space three single Stones contain join'd artfully together and all over cover'd with the Names of  Travellers  of every Nation there cut deep and left to tell succeeding Comers they were there before 'em  Other Pyra∣mids enter'd  MANY of the other  Pyramids  besides the two adjoining this we en∣ter'd finding  Tombs  in every one and several things worth speaking of but shou'd I name them all it wou'd require a greater  Space  than I can  here  allow my self and having therefore largely treated of the most re∣markable Discoveries we made let it suffice to tell the Reader that I have some Thoughts of publishing a  Treatise  of these famous  Pyramids  un∣mix'd with any other Observations when the  World's Goodnature  speaks it self  deserving  or my own  spare Time  appears permitting it  The uncer∣tainty of their Number  THE Number of the  Pyramids  was ever as uncertain as their  Founders  and  Antiquity  nor are they all of the same Magnitude some being far in∣ferior to the  smallest  of the  Three  so celebrated yet perhaps were those a∣way the  meanest  of the  little ones  wou'd well deserve the Name of  Won∣ders  Extent of their Situati∣on  THEY extend themselves in great unequal Distances for near the space of twenty Miles and may be seen  at large  from the  square Flat  upon the highest  Pyramid  but whether it proceeds from any difficulty owing to their  strange Position  or is caus'd by the  unwary Negligence  of those who strive to count 'em I am  yet  uncertain but it has been found as much im∣possible to do it  justly  as to tell the  Monuments  of  Stonehenge  upon  Salisbury Plain  a Task most  English Writers  have reported  difficult  How many little Pyra∣mids the Au∣thor told from the top of the great one  I look'd as nicely as I cou'd direct my  Eyes  from the  abovenam'd Place  and cou'd distinctly tell no more than five and twenty  Other Authors  have  reported them an hundred many  Modern Writers  say there are but eigh∣teen or at most but twenty  A probable Cause of the different Ac∣counts on this Subject  WHENCE these  different Accounts  shou'd rise I cannot guess unless a kind of  Foggy Weather  often known in  Egypt  might obscure the Prospect at such times as those who  lessen  the just Number of the  Pyramids  have chanc'd to take their Observations  A Question how the Stones were rais'd  IT is a Question  not a little curious  how the  Ancients  cou'd contrive to carry  Stones  of such amazing  Bulk  to such an  Altitude  whereby the  Fabrick  was erected and to this I answer that I have collected all the Notions  worth Remark  To be an∣swer'd in ano∣ther Treatise  which with the  Draughts  of several  fine Machines  and  admi∣rable Engines  I design to Publish when I find  this Book  so well receiv'd that  Gratitude  not  Recompense  may urge me to the setting forth the  Treatise  I so lately spoke of  Why the Au∣thor is not fuller on this Subject  I hope the Reader will not think me  blameable  in that I have not dwelt much longer on the Subject since it was so  copious  to afford me  Matter  those who may imagine me  too short  must certainly forget how many Things I am to treat of  equally  deserving Notice and how much I shou'd  outswell  the  Volume  I propos'd shou'd I  enlarge  to a  Prolixity  on every Sub∣ject which afforded  Room enough  to bear that way of Writing  CHAP XXXV Of the Trade of  Egypt  The Intro∣duction  A Conquer'd Nation must be Subject among other Shocks of  inaus∣picious Fate  to deviate from her  Genius  as she dwindles from her  Power  and the same destructive Hand whose unresisted Violence has crush'd the  Liberty  of a subverted Country may  undoubtedly  be said to triumph o'er the  Minds  of her unhappy  Natives  when it has de∣press'd their  Courage  and enslav'd their  Persons  Egypt  brought to  Turkish  Cu∣stoms  AS therefore  Egypt  wholly Subject to the Lawless Tyranny of an in∣sulting Monarch knows no wish'd partiality of  Freedom  nor is suffer'd to possess  peculiar Tolerations  it must consequently follow that her fix'd De∣pendance on the  Turkish Government  must strongly bend her  Biass'd People  in their Modern Slavery to an encourag'd Practice of those very  Customs Forms  and  Ceremonies  which are Publickly profess'd by their Imperious Masters  Why the  E∣gyptians  love not Traffick  HENCE the Reader having  long since  been inform'd of the prevai∣ling  Genius  which has still inclin'd the  Warlike Turks  to never resting search of Conquests will be apt to guess that their  Egyptian Subjects  aping ea∣gerly their strange Example cannot be  inclin'd  or  qualify'd  indeed for the encouragement of any thing so different from the perpetual Hurries of  fatiguing War  or  Martial Studies  as the softer Practice of a Trading Life and the less dangerous  Rudiments  of Peaceful Traffick  Extreamly fond of War  AMBITIOUS Aims and swelling Hopes which take their  Beings  from a love of War have chang'd this Nation from her ancient Searches after  Arts  and  Sciences  to an imperious disregard of every Vertue not ex∣erted in a  Martial manner  Arms alone are the encourag'd  White  they uni∣versally direct their tow'ring  Shafts  at and a different Cause has now pro∣duc'd  among them all  the same effect which animated gloriously the  anci∣ent World  to scorn of  Danger  and the Practices of War which how esteem'd may plainly be discover'd in the numerous Writings of those  early Ages  handed down to late Posterity with a deserv'd Applause and uni∣versal Admiration particularly in the following Verses of  Tyrtaeus  a  Greek Poet  flourishing about the  thirty fifth Olympiad  Tyrtaeus  a  Greek  Poet in the th Olympi∣ad  The Quotati∣on English'd  I scarce can think a Man deserves a  Name  Or can  Regard  from Fellow Creatures claim  Not tho' in  Wrestling  he is grown Compleat  And Skill'd in all the  Virtues  of the  Feet    Not tho' he boasts a  Cyclops  Strength and Grace  Or can outrun the  Northern Winds  of  Thrace    Tho in his  Form  he  Tithon's self  excells  And midst such endless Heaps of  Riches  dwells  As not King  Cynara  's or  Mida  's Fate  Gave in Possession of their  wealthiest  State  Not tho' he had more  Pow'rful Kingdoms  won  Than e'er bless'd  Pelops Tantalus  's Son  Not tho' more  Music  on his  Accents  hung  Than ever grac'd the  sweet Adrastu  's Tongue  Not tho' he was with  ev'ry Talent  bless'd  And all  Heav'ns Gifts  but  that of War  possess'd  Nor can  He  truly boast a  Martial Soul  Who cannot bravely stand where  Seas of Slaughter  roll  Who does not nobly scorn  repeated Blows  And dares not  wish  to  Fight  surrounded by his  Foes    This  is  true Valour  and  this Grace  possess'd  Of all  Rewards  we aim at is the  best    He  's well adorn'd who has  such Actions  done  And  that Youth  richliest Drest who his own  Trophies  won  Hence

conve∣nient Opportunities to every distant Part of  Trading Christendom  What they export to it  BY way of Barter for the Merchandizes we receive from thence we load our Ships with nothing more than these Commodities the Product of  our own  and  Foreign Manufactures  which I have largely mention'd in the Chapter treating of the  Trade  at present carried on between our  Countrymen  and those of  Turkey  How the  French Dutch  and  Venetians  trade with  Egypt  THE  French  and  Dutch  both carry on a Trade with  Egypt  but inferi∣or much to  that  we manage in the  Port of Alexandria  but the

when they have us'd some Arts at home in the refining and new moulding it they make the famous  Chrystal  and so celebrated  Glasses  which are much esteem'd and numerously sent about to every Part of  Europe  BEFORE I close this Chapter 'twill not be  digressive  from the Sub∣ject I am treating on to tell the  Etymology  from whence we give the Name to  Paper  Whence our Writing Pa∣per took its Name  THERE is a very common  Herb  which grows in the  Egyptian Mar∣shes  call'd of old  Papyrus Nilotica  from the Appellation of the River 'tis a kind of  stringly Leaf  of  Filamental Substance  which the  Ancients  us'd to strip in  Flakes  of which 'tis almost naturally compos'd then spreading them up∣on a Board they moisten'd them with certain Waters of a  stiptic Composition  and by pressing them with  weighty Instruments  so well enabled them to bear the Writing on that they were us'd by all Men for that purpose and com∣pos'd most part of those unnumber'd Volumes in the  Library  of  Philadel∣phus  Why the Au∣thor is so short upon this sub∣ject  'TIS needless to enlarge on the particulars of the abovenam'd Ma∣nufactures hence exported since they are not only  long since  extant in the lists of many Writers but are now become Familiar to the Trading part of  England  who alone are those to whom a full Account thereof might  even formerly  have been imagin'd  welcome  CHAP XXXVI Of the  Revenues  of  Egypt  and to what Ʋses they are Applied  AS the unbounded Power of the  Turkish Sultan  Authorizes his Pretensions to an undisputed sway in the  Egyptian Govern∣ment  so does it thence entitle him to the Possession of a cer∣tain Annual income or  Revenue  The Revenue how gather'd in  Egypt  which is Rais'd Collected and in all kinds Manag'd as I have before Related in the other Parts of his Dominions till deposited at  Cairo  in the Hands of the  Bashaw  then Governing as  Viceroy  for the  Turkish Empire  How Employ∣ed  THENCE Guarded by proportion'd Bodies of the Standing Forces kept in  Egypt  it is  severally  employ'd to certain setled uses and from  Hand to Hand  deliver'd carefully in order to be us'd for the respective purposes to which it was decreed since first the Arms of the  Victorious Selym  made him Master of this Fertile Country  A Calculation of the whole Revenue  THE whole  Revenue  as it has been Calculated justly by some late Inquirers into the Condition of the  Turkish  Treasures is no more than  Eighteen Hundred Thousand Gold Chequins  that is  Nine Hundred Thou∣sand English Pounds a Year  and such a Sum is Annually rais'd and di∣stributed with great exactness in the just proportions of the Three Di∣visions following  The First Third how dispos'd of  THREE Hundred Thousand Pounds a Year  are set apart for the Pos∣session of the  Turkish Sultan  and deliver'd to the Care of certain chosen  Regiments of Horse  whose Duty 'tis to Guard it safely to  Constantinople  and receiving a Discharge from the  Lord Tefterdar  or  Treasurer  return when they have left it in his Custody to be employ'd according to the Will and Pleasure of his Master the  Grand Signior  sometimes it hap∣pens that the  Turkish Fleet  with formidable strength is ready to de∣part from  Egypt  at the time wherein the Guards set forward with the Money and in that Case 'tis Embark'd on Board the Admiral who saves the Soldiers their expected Trouble and acquits them from their Charge at  Alexandria  tho' this but rarely happens and is found a very dangerous way because the  Treasure  undefended by a Mighty Naval Force would probably become a Prey to the Industrious va∣lour of the  Christian Squadrons  ever Cruising on the Coasts of  Turkey  The second third how dispos'd of  THREE Hundred Thousand Pounds a Year are next appropriated to defray the Charges of the numerous Offices dependent on the  Great Bashaw  and other necessary Uses in relation to the  Posts  incumbent on such Men as are  deputed by  and  thence subservient to  the Great Supream and Arbitrary Monarch of the  Conquer'd Egypt  The last third how apply'd  THE Third Three Hundred Thousand Pounds a Year are still employ'd in bearing the  Expences  of the many thousand zealous Pilgrims who resort each Year with a  Bigotted Faith  to the great  Rendezvous  at  Cairo  whence they all set out with wonderful Devotion and a superstitious Ignorance in order to compleat the necessary  Pilgrimage to Mecca  their False  Prophet  's Birth Place  THESE three abovenam'd Uses are the only ones to which the  Turks  apply the Sums they gain from the  Egyptian Tribute  nor is it law∣ful by the fix'd Decrees of the  Grand Signior  's Empire that the Sums thence rising should be any ways perverted to what Use soever devious from the ends to which they are appointed  Why the Re∣venue is so small  'TIS true nine hundred thousand Pounds a Year are no great Income from the Conquest of a Country so exceeding famous for her known Fertility that when the  Romans  conquer'd her of old she gain'd the Name of  Granary  to that successful Empire But as  Wealth  decreases by a long continued Series of  destractive War  'tis no great wonder if we  now  find  Egypt  far from the Capacity of yielding such amazing heaps of  Spoil  and  Plenty  as in ancient Ages bless'd the Plunder of  Victorious Legions  How the Turks make up the defici∣ency  HOWEVER tho' the Sum exacted thence by the  Grand Signior  is a smaller Burden than they well might bear yet are the  Turks  so dexte∣rously skill'd in managing Authority to the Advantage of their  Purses  and their Master's  Safety  that the  vanquish'd Natives  are not only crush'd beyond all hopes of growing rich but kept below the very possibility of framing with the smallest shadow of Success a dangerous Rebellion  CHAP XXXVII Of the  Egyptian Catacombs  and the  Mummys  which are found in the Ancient Sepulchres of their Dead  BY the  foregoing  Descriptions of  Cairo Memphis Babylon  and the Stupendious Workmanship of those prodigious  Pyramids  whose  outward  Magnitude  interior  Passages and  subterraneous  Cavities have so deserv'dly stil'd them the Worlds Chief  Wonder  the Cu∣rious Reader may have form'd a Notion no ways disagreable of the  valu∣able  Antiquities whose  still remaining  Splendours speak  amazingly  the former Grandeur of the  Egyptian  Nation  The Antiqui∣ty of some of the  Mummys  I shall now proceed to give a strange but true Account of those vast  Ca∣tacombs  wherein the Old  Egyptians  were Embalm'd and Buried and whose black horrid Wombs do yet contain a formidable Proof how long our Hu∣mane Bodies may preserve their Substance when defended by the help of  Art  from the destructive Power of a  Natural  Corruption For in the dark Recesses of those Gloomy Caverns to this Day remain unnumber'd Thou∣sands of those very  People  who liv'd and triumph'd o'er the Subject  Israelites  before the Hand of  GOD  deliver'd that  ungrateful  Nation from their long Captivity  'TIS a Curiosity however  Dangerous  extreamly  Satisfactory  for an Adventurous Traveller to behold those  Lifeless  Bodies which from Age to Age have been Interr'd in these surprizing  Monuments  and bidding strong Defiance to the Course of  Nature  remain untouch'd by piercing  Putrefaction  and have for several Thousand Years lain undi∣sturb'd  entire  and  sound  in every Part nor will undoubtedly for many Ages yet to come be any ways subject to the  smallest  Diminution  The Extent of the  Catacombs  THESE  Vaults  and dark  Sepulchres  of their Ancient  Dead  extend themselves in greatest Numbers from the Neighbourhood of  Memphis  to the distant Borders of the  Libyan Desart  containing Thirty Miles in  length  and  breadth  proportionable Many have been broken up from time to time and often enter'd by the daring Curiosity of  European  Travellers but many yet remain unopen'd nor is it an Attempt consistent with the Dictates of a  Selfpreserving  Humour to Visit frequently those  Dusky  Pa∣laces of Death known only by the sight of some large Stone  unnatural  to the Place which turn'd aside discovers under it a narrow Descent not much unlike the Mouth of such a Well as we may often see in  British  Vil∣lages  The manner of descending the Vaults  The Passage down was form'd by gradual Steps cut circularly thro' the Neck of this Descent but Time or  accidental  Ruin having now de∣fac'd those  old  Conveniencies some  Rope  or other  neat  Contrivance is made use of to let down those who are desirous of  enlivening  their Contem∣plations by such a  strange  and  melancholy  Prospect The bottom of this steep Descent admits them instantly to one large Vault which leads to many o∣thers high and dismal built securely with a small square Stone of Co∣lour black and shining not unreasonably suppos'd by some those famous  Bricks  so Celebrated in the Scripture for the Workmanship of the Poor Captiv'd  Israelites  who labour'd hardly under the harsh Injunctions of an  Egyptian  Bondage  THE greatest part of these dark Arches remain entirely whole and stately but in some few Places are defac'd and fallen so as to render the Passage thro' them almost  impracticably  difficult  Some  are distinguish'd by small Pillars oppositely plac'd in graceful Order  Others  wholly un∣adorn'd and naked leading like the Streets of  Christian  Cities one through another and forming with a sort of  venerable  Majesty a Gloomy  Labyrinth  of Death and Horrour  The Order in which the  Mummys  lie  For on either side lie rang'd in  measur'd  Order at near Three Foot distance from each other promiscuous Bodies of  Men Women  and  Children  some whereof such likely as were Rich and Honourable have flat Stones a little elevated at the Head and Feet plac'd neatly under them Others lie meanlier in the Common Sand but all  Embalm'd  and wrap'd about with numerous folds of SearclothLi∣nen which forcibly untwin'd from their defenceless Bodies looks not much unlike the middle Rind of some decaying  Oak  and leaves the Corps entirely Solid  Whole  and  Perfect  in its full dimensions of a  blackish  Red or  dusky  Brown in Colour its Substance  hard  like Pitch or Rosin their  Backs  and  Breasts  are often stain'd with  Hieroglyphick Cyphers  and on their  Bosoms  lie small  figur'd  Idols made of  Artificial  Stone Bak'd hard and dura∣ble  or sometimes folded Scroles of  rough  and  painted  Parchment some of which Devices I shall in the course of  this  Chapter describe to the Judicious Reader with my own Opinion of the  likeliest  Significations of their  diver∣ting  Fancies and  Hieroglyphical  Contrivances  The Danger of too great a Curiosity  THE Danger of Descending such of these  Repositories  as are most Curi∣ous is extreamly great by the distance they are at from the  Cities  afore∣mention'd which exposes frequently the  unwary  Traveller to the barbarous Violence of the Inhumane  Arabs  who watching secretly for a favourable Opportunity will often close the Mouth of the  Sepulchre  and by that means Starving the  unhappy  Strangers return some few Days after to di∣vide the Plunder of those  Miscarried  Gentlemen  A strange Ac∣cident which befel the Au∣thor in a Vault a∣mongst the  Mummys  AN Accident occurring  unexpectedly  to my own Experience may per∣haps divert the  Reader  in the Relation of what I can with Pleasure  now  reflect on tho' it gave me little Satisfaction when I was liable to its Dan∣ger About Miles  SouthEast  of  Memphis  lie several Famous  Catacombs  but  as dangerously seen  are commonly neglected  however  a strong De∣sire of seeing something that for so many Ages had continu'd shut from Mortal View excited my Curiosity to forget the  Hazard  and procure as Guide a  Native  of that Country to conduct me with three Fellow Travellers to the Place abovemention'd The Fellow was a little back∣ward alledging in excuse of his  unwillingness  that 'twas an Inconvenien∣cy to lie a Night abroad upon the  Open Desart  but assuring him we wou'd rather Travel all Night long he consented to go with us We Rode on  Mules  and Travell'd with a wonderful Delight thro' a  rough  and  sandy  Coun∣try till we arriv'd at a Place where Stones of  vast uncommon  Sizes poin∣ted out the Passages to what we look'd for We were pleas'd to see the Coast so clear that not the smallest Tract of  Man  or  Beast  appear'd to give us cause of Jealousy We alighted from our  Mules  and tying them toge∣ther went towards the  largest  Stone we saw amongst them and turning it with much ado aside were all surpriz'd to see securely fastned and rowl'd up on the inside a  Ladder  of  Ropes  but imagining it might have been left there by some who had descended  formerly  we spar'd the trou∣ble of making use of a Conveniency our  Guide  had with him and having unfolded what we found  there  ready went  backwards down  with each Man a  Pistol  in one Hand and a  lighted  Torch in the other A strange  un∣common  Smell saluted our first Entrance with an Odour not to be imagin'd by such as have not known it by Experience and the  blazing  Torches striking a faint glimmering Light thro' the thickness of the  Gloom  discover'd as we walk'd along on either side the  discolour'd  Faces of the  Dead  with a  strange  and  inexpressible  Horrour We had scarce pass'd three Yards within the Vault when the  foremost  of our Company stumbling accidentally on something that lay in his way fell  headlong  over it whereupon holding down our Torches we perceiv'd two Men in  Christian  Habits extended cross each other and appearing  newly  Dead with all the  pale  and  frightful  Marks of a Convulsive Horrour in their contracted  Joints  and  Faces  Be∣tween the Feet of one there lay a  Pocket Book  and  Pencil  which taking up and opening we read with great Difficulty and more Concern the fol∣lowing Lines  there  Written in  Italian  but in a Character that was hardly legible for besides the Confusion of one Letter running into another the Lines were  here and there  writ upon certain  others  which seem'd to have been design'd as  Memorandums  for several private Businesses  Two Gentle∣men found dead in a Vault  LORENZO  and  FERDINANDO BONAVOGLIA  Dear Unhappy Brothers born at  Pisa  a City of  Italy  dy'd here by  Grief  and  Hunger  barbarously shut in and lost for ever  June    th  Good Christian if thy dear Eyes shall read our Misery Pray  for our Souls O  Jesus  O  Mary  Mother of God hear and pity us  IT should seem by the melancholy Contents of this small  Pocket Book  that these unfortunate Gentlemen had been observ'd to enter by some  Ara∣bian  Murderers and the  sequel  of this Relation will I think incline the Reader to the same Opinion By the Date of the  abovenam'd  Sentences we found they had not long been there for to the best of my Remem∣brance 'twas on the  Twenty Second  of the same Month that we came  thither  AMAZ'D  and half confounded at the miserable Objects which we saw before us we began to think upon the Danger we were in the Ap∣prehension whereof encreas'd immediately to a  double  Magnitude by the  ghastly  Looks and  trembling  Agonies which shook the heartless  Guide  with fierce Convulsions  As  we knew him  more  familiar than our selves with the Customs of his Country  so  we guess'd our Danger more extraordinary by the Fright we  saw  him in and judging it a necessary Prudence to make the best of Time and Opportunity  we  retreated with the utmost hast to the Place  we  came in at  A dangerous Surprize  but to our great Surprize perceiv'd the  Stone  plac'd over the  Mouth  of the Descent the very Moment  we  came directly under it with all the fright imaginable  we  began to seek the  Rope  by which  we  had Descended but 'twas taken up and all the hopes of our Deliverance from that  dreadful Prison  were entirely dash'd to nothing by the unexpected turn of such a sad  Catastrophe  'Twas  here we  felt the fear of Death in all its roughest  Attributes  and the Guide  who  shou'd have giv'n us Comfort in our deep Extremity encreas'd the  weight  of our Concern by piercing  Cries  and oftrepeated  Curses  on our rash Attempt which had involv'd  our selves  and  him  in one promiscuous Ruin and would destroy in him the chief Support and poor  Subsistence  of his unhappy  Wife  and  Family  For my part tho' expos'd in equal measure to the threatned Misery I  was  so strongly mov'd by the Sighs Groans Tears and  wring∣ing  Hands of this complaining Wretch that I forgot the Nature of the Place I walk'd in and forming  strange  unreasonable Hopes that  we  might find some other Passage urg'd the Company to ramble farther thro' those dismal  Cavities  but considering the Horror  which in such a Place  the want of Light wou'd soon produce and  willing  to keep back the evil Hour as long as possible  we  extinguish'd Four of our Five Torches and with the sickly Light of the  remaining One  walk'd on with heavy Hearts from  Vault  to  Vault  quite thro' those dismal  Mansions  till at a little distance from the  Guide  who bore the Light before us  we  perceiv'd with  more  than  common  Terrour the  faint  Idea's of six Pale Faces close against the Wall that stood before us  we started  at the Sight and saw them move as if they stalk'd to come upon us  undiscover'd  so that rightly guessing they design'd no good with one consent  we fir'd our Pistols  'tis impossible to make the Reader sensible of the prodigious loud Report and rumbling Noise this  one  Discharge created in the  Vault  it roll'd above our Heads like some uncommon Clap of  Thunder  and continued still encreasing a consi∣derable time Whether  Fear  or some unlucky  Accident  produc'd the Cause I cannot well determine but the frighted  Guide  let fall his  Torch  which presently extinguish'd and running  backwards  with  impetuous  Fury beat down a Gentleman of our Company and tumbling on the Ground lay still in a most  profound  and  breathless  Silence When the  Report  was over  we  expected every Moment to have  heard  or  felt  the Persons  we  had seen before us but all was strangely still no  Tread  or  Voice  alarm'd our Fears nor could  we  guess what Accident had rid us of our Danger till thro' the Wall  before us we  perceiv'd a sudden Ray of Light break briskly in and coming to the Place found  there  a Hole dug thro' the Stone or  Brick  AN EXPLANATION OF THE PLATE Which

Peterborow and Monmouth y  e  Authors Honour'd Patron Encourager of his Undertaking this Plate is Most humbly dedicated  which open'd largely into another  Catacomb  thro' which  we  saw the Pas∣sage that had let in so much Light upon us and heard an  unintelligible  Noise of Hallowing descend as from the Mouth of that uncover'd  Cavity  thro' which  we  could perceive distinctly  Six  Tall Men climb swiftly up and seem'd confus'd as if afraid of some  approaching  Danger  The Author's strange Escape from the Vault  The fear of dying in that  horrid  Place had banish'd every other from our Thoughts so that getting  eagerly  tho' the broken Wall  we  ran immediately to the Entrance of the  Vault  and hearing neither  Voice  nor any  other  Sign of their conti∣nuing above  we  ventur'd to ascend as  they  had done and certainly the Light of Heaven did never more  Enliven  Man than it did our joyful Com∣pany at such a strange Deliverance  NO sooner were  we up  but looking round  we  could perceive Four  Arabs  riding hastily towards the left side of the  Desart  leading away our  Mules  as lawful Booty and follow'd at some distance by  Six others  On the right of our unlucky Station  we  perceiv'd a Troop of  Turkish HorseMen  whom  we  knew by their Appearance to belong to the  Bashaw  and to be part of those convenient Forces kept on purpose to  Patrole  from Place to Place and guard the Country from the presumptuous Insults of these  Ara∣bian  Villanies  Till then  I never met a  Turkish  Party with the smallest Sa∣tisfaction but was now transported with a boundless Joy at the  welcome  Prospect of their first  Appearance  WE walk'd to meet them and informing their  Commanding  Officer of what had pass'd he strait detach'd a Number of his Men to gallop after them who were no sooner seen advancing by the  Wary Arabs  but they set our  Captiv'd  Mules at Liberty and soon outran the hopes of their  lessswift  Pursuers However  we  were very well contented to have sped so well and fearing we might lose our Safety by the dangerous Absence of our newcome Champions  we  agreed to give the  Officer  the value of Five and Twenty Shillings  a piece  upon Condition he would see us safely to the  Neighbourhood of Cairo  He accepted the  Proposal  and invited us to de∣scend again while  he  with several of his Men would keep us Company and leave the rest  above  to watch for our Security His offering to accom∣pany us  convinc'd  us of his  Honesty  and missing the poor  Guide  who had been left below  They descend again  we  ventur'd once again to visit the  late  Scene of our Mis∣fortune being enter'd with  three Lights  which the  Captain  order'd to be carried such as I have  elsewhere  largely treated of and which afford a Flame much  brighter  and more  powerful  than our small Torches  we  proceeded gra∣dually  from Place to Place  and search'd in vain o'er all the Vaults for the  poor frighted Fellow  we had left behind us till  at last  arriving at the farthest end of that first  Catacomb  which  we  descended we observ'd one  Mummy  higher than the rest and drawing near to view it more particularly  we  could perceive it stir at which surpriz'd and calling for the  Lights  to know its meaning the first thing  They find the Guide hid under a Mummy  we  saw was the  poor Guide  who being crowded in between the  Wall  and the  Mummy  was creeping under it as far as he was able and turn'd his Eyes upon the  Lights  and  Company  with such a dismal Languish that it threw us into a long and violent fit of Laughter The Honest Man's Simplicity had perswaded him that if he lay close he might pass for a  Mummy  and having crawl'd  from Vault to Vault  he chose that Place for his  Asylum  from those  Arabs  for whom he  now  mistook the  Turkish Soldiers  A joyful Transport  HE heard us  laugh  and looking earnestly about him found with a sur∣prizing Joy that he had been  mistaken  in his Apprehensions and the rapid Transports thence oppressing his recover'd Spirits made him  start  from his unnecessary Shelter and embracing me who then unluckily stood nearest him express'd the Sense he had of his  scarce credited Delivery  with such  Ungovernable signs of Satisfaction in the Leaping  up and down  that Treading frequently upon my Feet I was oblig'd to shake him off with  Roughness  unbecoming  the Soft  Airs of due Congratulation  NOW had we time without the  fear  of a succeeding Danger to inspect with all the  Zeal  of an unlimitted Curiosity those gloomy Tracts of Death and Terrour in whose dismal Paths we had  before  been so amazing∣ly surpriz'd by dangerous Interruption  The Observa∣tions they made in their Second Des∣cent  THE Observations  then  which favour'd by so fair an Opportunity we made were these the Bodies of the  Mummies  not exceeding  in their Stature  those of common Height  now Living  are a certain confutation of that  old mistake  which Teaches many to believe that as the World In∣creases in her  Age  Mankind decrease in  Strength  and  Magnitude  THE many Thousand Folds which  Swath'd  some Bodies  in the Ca∣tacomb  were Wound about the  Corps  with so much smoothness and such admirable Art and Neatness of Contrivance that the Nicest Hand  Modern Times  would fall so short of  equalling  that they could never  Imitate  the Beauties of the Practice should they  now  attempt it  WE all took Notice that the Heads of many  Mummies  were di∣vided from their Bodies and perceiv'd  that Part  the Weakest and most prejudic'd by Time even in those  Corps  which seem'd intire and no ways Rob'd of their Original Proportion  THE Faces of such Bodies as appear'd the Richest by their  Orna∣ments  and  ways of Lying  we observ'd all coverd over with a very  thin and Shining Aromatic Searcloath  of such admirable form and such a Skilful Preparation that it only serv'd to keep the Head more  lasting  and  en∣tire  which  else  was found a Part most subject to decay without ob∣scuring the Appearance of the Countenance or altering  even the Mi∣nutest turn  of any  Feature  The Painted Rolls  THE  Rolls  which lay on many of their Breasts contain'd  as I have said before  a Thousand different kind of  Hieroglyhic Figures  some done in  Gold  some  Red  some  Blew  some  Green  and others  Black in short  of every  Form  and  Colour  thence a Man may reasonably claim the Liberty to guess he could distinguish many things relating to the  Age Death Quality Life Vertues  and  Profession  of the Person to whose Breast they are Affix'd  THUS  for Example  on the Bosom of one  Mummy whole  and  Fair  in every there there lay a  Roll  whereon in Lines of  Gold  and  Azure  we distinguish'd plainly among many more the following  Fi∣gures  An  Hierogly∣phic  Image in the  Catacombs  UPON a very  High  and  Craggy Rock  there stood a Throne where∣on in all the  State  of  Ancient Monarchs  sat a Man in  Royal Robes  and Wearing on his Head a  Regal Diadem  his  Right Hand  highly E∣levated held a Sword with Threatning Fury and his  Left  extended with a kind of a disdainful Air appear'd to Mock the Fruitless Efforts of a Numerous Company of  Men in Arms  who seem'd with eagerness to  grasp the Rocks  and  vainly aim'd  with angry Looks at  Reaching the De∣fended King  who sat secure and Triumph'd in their Disappoint∣ments  AN EXPLANATION OF THE PLATE VVhich Represents Exactly an  Egyptian Hieroglyphic  Found upon the Bosom of a  MƲMMY  in the  CATACOMBS  A  A King upon his Throne or an Emblem of a Prince who Governs Justly  B  An Emblem of Designing Underhanded Treachery  C  An Emblematical Description of the Great Stability of Justice and Moderation  D D D D  An Emblematical Representation of Ungovernable HeadStrong Treason and its Difficulties  hieroglyphic found on a mummy in the catacombs of Egypt  AN EGYPTIAN HIEROGLYPHIC  To the Right Hon  ble  Cary Countess of Peterborough c This Plate is Most Humbly Dedicated  An Emblem of crafty Treason  BƲT on the other side the Rock  behind the Monarch's Back appear'd a brisk and fiery  Youth  who having mounted by the help of a  tall Ladder  was just steping from its  topmost Round  upon the  Rock it self  with seeming resolution to attack and kill the  King  with a long Spear presented at him was witheld from his Intent by means of a  large Chain  descending from a  Cloud  above his Head and twining suddenly about his Arms while  he himself  was wounded in the Bosom by a Sword directed by a Hand which issued likewise from the  Cloud  abovenam'd  NOW in my Imagination  'tis a Task of no great difficulty  to unfold the Mystery contain'd in this intelligible  Hieroglyphic  perhaps I am mistaken but as probably am not however right or wrong I'll give the Reader my  Opinion  let him judge as he thinks proper  The meaning of the Hiero∣glyphic  THE  Monarch  represented in his  Regal Ornaments  I take to mean a  King  who Rules with  State  and  Power  The  Sword  denotes the Justice of his  Office  The  disdainful Look  implies a scorn of  Treason  and its  Pra∣ctisers  THE  Rock  whereon he sits enthron'd was doubtless meant to signi∣fy his  Governments Solidity its craggy Roughness  was design'd to show what dangerous Precipices we are led to by Ambition  Emblem of Open Rebel∣lion  THE  Rash arm'd Multitude  who strive  in vain  before the Face of the abovenam'd  Monarch  to ascend and wound him are as  Emblems  of of those daring and imprudent  Rebels  who will openly presume to carry on their Hate to  just Authority  and prosecute the Dictates of their Impious Wishes in the  Face  of  Majesty  THEIR  numerous Repulses  and the  fruitless Efforts  of their eager Ap∣plication serve to  shew  how much it is impossible by open Practices of  Lawless Villany  to  shock  the Throne of an  establish'd Government  or succeed in the Endeavours of a  treacherous Inclination  THE siery Youth just mounting from a Ladder to the  summit  of the  Rock  behind the  King  and holding up a  Spear  as if with design to  kill  him signifies in my Opinion that more crafty kind of  Treason  carried on by un∣derhand Intrigues and subtle Secrecy and powerfully assisted by  prevailing Parties  Emblem of Heaven's Justice  THE  descending Cloud  from which appears the  Chain  that binds him and the  Hand  which wounds his Bosome with a  Spear  was meant by the  Egyptians of Antiquity  to represent  that Great  but  unknown Power  by whose sure tho' secret means of Justice they perceiv'd the sacred Persons of  Just Monarchs  safely guarded from  designing Treachery  and very rarely knew a  Villain  Die unpunish'd  NOW if the Ingenious Reader will but  put together  these Interpretati∣ons of the  Hieroglyphic Mystery  he will soon perceive a  nice connexion  of its several Parts which we may read as follows  The Hiero∣glyphic lite∣rally Inter∣preted  That Prince's Throne who governs justly is so strongly seated on the Rock of Power that he can look with scorn upon the vain Attempts of those Mad Rebells who invading his Prerogative with open Vi∣olence encounter such prodigious and undreamt of Difficulties that they fall in their Endeavours wretched Victims to the disappointment of Ambition  But that more  Crafty Politic  and  Private Traitor  who unge∣nerously aims at a Success in his Rebellion from the undiscover'd Practices of close Disloyalty tho' he may prosper for a while in unde∣tected Villanies is notwithstanding his great Cautions watch'd in e∣very Step he makes by the  unknown Omniscience  of some Hea∣venly Being who when his Plot seems ripe for Execution chains his Will o'erthrows his Treason and amazingly converts his un∣suspecting Malice to his own Destruction  The particu∣lar Applicati∣on of the Hie∣roglyphic  THIS general Interpretation led me to conclude the  Hieroglyphic  was design'd a Monitory Lecture to disswade Mankind from Practices of  Treason  by an artful Declaration of its fatal Consequences and the  Application  in particular directed me to guess the  Mummy  on whose Body it was repre∣sented had been formerly some Youth made wretched by the  Knowledge  if not Executed for the  Practice  of some  Treason  or Rebellion  They reas∣cend from the Catacomb  WHEN we had made as many Observations as we could we reas∣cended by the way we enter'd at and were conducted safely to  Grand Cairo  by the  faithful Captain  and his  Party  on the  Terms  before∣nam'd  INQUIRING when we were return'd if any News had reach'd the City of the loss of  two Italian Gentlemen  and hearing nothing of it we imagin'd it our Duties to acquaint a Person of  that Country  who resided there  in Public Business  with the strange Particulars of the abovenam'd  Ac∣cident  He presently inform'd us that he knew too well the  Gentlemen  we spoke of that they had been recommended to him in their Travells  thither  and had been forewarn'd how  dangerous  it was to visit those  remote  and  dismal Catacombs  that they refus'd to listen to Perswasion and had taken a  Guide  and several  Servants  with them none of which had  since  been heard of  What became of the dead Bodies of the two  Italian  Gentlemen  IN short the  Gentleman  with melancholy Marks of Thanks rewarded our  Civility  in giving him this sorrowful Intelligence he hir'd the  Captain  who had been our  Convoy  to remove the Bodies of the  two unhappy Brothers  from the  Catacomb  to  Cairo  whence he afterwards Embark'd them on a  Vessel  which was bound for  Europe  and which brought them soon  God  knows a  shocking  and  unwelcome Cargo  to their Country and Relati∣ons  How they were betray'd  IT seems their  Guide  since  taken  and  Impal'd alive  for his abominable Villany had held a Correspondence with the  Arabs  and betray'd his  Charge  by ent'ring with them to the  Catacomb  and giving them the  Slip  at a convenient Opportunity thro' the other  Hole  set open purposely the  Servants  who remain'd  above  were siez'd on and made Prisoners by the  Arabs  who return'd to Plunder their  dead Masters  at a time when they un∣happily found  us  an unexpected Booty in the Gin they came to  PROBABLY the reason of their leaving the  Italian Gentlemen  un∣plunder'd when they shut them in was owing to the distant Prospect of some  Turkish Party  frequently  Patroling  as I said before from Place to Place about those  Desarts  AS our  Escape  was wonderful so were our  Praises  and  Thanksgiving  Great and Hearty yet the Horror whose  unnatural Shock  when we su∣stain'd the Danger  startled  Nature is  by time  converted to a certain inex∣pressible Contentment in the sweet Remembrance and Reflection on the oddness of the Accident nor is it a new thing to change our Passions with  the Change of Time in such a manner  Seneca  has left us his  Authority  to prove it common in the following Words  Sen Trag Herc  Quae fuit durum pati  Meminisse dulce est  Mens  Mem'ries  commonly  delighted  are  To  think  on what they  once  found hard to  bear  The Cata∣combs nearer  Cairo  not worth de∣scribing  I could enlarge extreamly on the  Subject  of the  Catacombs  but think it al∣together needless since the finest of them all are those which I have here so largely treated of and which are very seldom visited by any  Travellers  nor to my  Knowledge  have been ever yet describ'd in any of their  Writings  all the  Wells  or little Places nearer  Cairo  which contain the Bo∣dies of  Egyptian Mummies  are not only so inferior to these  Catacombs  as scarce to merit mention but have been already taken notice of so frequent∣ly by other  Travellers  in almost every Book of this kind extant in our  Lan∣guage  that 'tis neither worth  my Trouble  in repeating the Particulars or an  Ingenious Readers  in perusing the Relation  CHAP XXXVIII Of that Part of  Egypt  formerly  the Land of Goshen  and of the Passage of  Caravans thro'  the  Libyan Desarts  Delta  why so call'd  AMONGST the many  fertil  Tracts of Land enriching  Egypt  with an annual Plenty there is one call'd  Delta  by the  Ancients  in regard to the Resemblance it was thought to bear the  Graecian  Letter of that Name  Two Streams of  Nilus  THE River  Nilus  not above four Miles below  Grand Cairo  is divided into two distinct and navigable  Streams  one running  Eastward  and the other towards the  West  the first emits his Waters into the  Mediterranean  not far distant from the  Old Pelusium  now call'd  Damiata  and the second loses his swift Channel in the same  Sea  just below  Rosetta  THESE two abovenam'd  Channels  form by their triangular Course a very rich and spacious  Island  even the fattest Soil and most delightful Part of Fruitful  Egypt  and it is this Portion of the Country which as I have said before was once distinguish'd by the Name of  Delta  The Land of  Goshen  THIS Tho' many contradict the Notion I imagine to have been in former Times the  Land of Goshen  and am much confirm'd in my Opinion by the  Holy Scriptures  undeniable Authority As  for Example  in the tenth Verse of the forty fifth Chapter of  Genesis  where  Joseph  tells his  Fa∣ther  Gen  chap v  And thou shalt dwell in the Land of Goshen and thou shalt be near unto me thou and thy Children and thy Childrens Children and thy Flocks and thy Herds and all that thou hast  BY the Words  near unto me  in this Verse it's evidently  certain  that we cannot guess with greater probability than in believing  Delta  to have been the Place since 'tis the nearest fruitful Spot of Ground to  Memphis  then the Residence of  Joseph  in the whole  Egyptian  Country  Goshen  prov'd a fruitful Country  AND that the  Land of Goshen  was not only  near  the  Capital  but  pre∣ferable  in a thousand other Blessings to the rest of  Egypt  we may be assur'd by the Authority I just now quoted and some other Places  IN the fourth fifth and sixth Verses of the seven and fortieth Chapter of  Genesis  we find the Sons of  Jacob  pleading for and  Pharaoh  granting them the  Land of Goshen  in the following Sentences  Gen  chap v  They said moreover unto Pharaoh for to sojourn in the Land are we come for thy Servants have no pasture for their Flocks for the  Famine is sore in the Land of Canaan Now therefore we pray thee let thy Sevants dwell in the Land of Goshen  And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph saying Thy Father and thy Brethren are come unto thee  The Land of Egypt is before thee in the best of the Land make thy Father and Brethren to dwell in the Land of Goshen let them dwell  AGAIN in the six and fortieth Chapter  Pharaoh  speaks to  Joseph  in the following manner  And take your Father and your Houshold and come unto me And I will give you the good of the Land of Egypt and ye shall eat the fat of the Land  Also regard not your Stuff For the good of all the Land of Egypt is yours  Delta  by the Author thought to be the Land of  Goshen  BY these abovenam'd Passages of  Holy Writ  we may without absurdi∣ty conclude that the triangular Tract of Land call'd  Delta  by the An∣cients or at least some part thereof is cettainly the same which formerly was dwelt in by the  Bondag'd Israelites  and bore the Appellation of the  Land of Goshen  The common Notion of it  BUT many are of an Opinion opposite to this and judge the  Land of Goshen  to have been that part of  Egypt  situate betwixt  Grand Cairo  and the  Libyan Desarts  Why absurd  Not to enter into a Dispute on that account I only shall beg leave to make one  Observation  and that is A Country so extreamly  Barren  nor Productive of the smallest Mark of competent  Encrease  much less of flowing  Plenty  cannot reasonably be imagin'd reconcilable to the Idea's of  Fertility  we take from the Accounts the  Scriptures  give us of the  Land of Goshen  PROCEED we now from  Egypt  to the  HolyLand  to which the common Passage from  Grand Cairo  lies thro' Part of  Idumaea  and the dangerous  Desarts  of  Arabia the Stony  The way of Travelling in  Caravans  CARAVANS which I have elsewhere in this Book explain'd the mea∣ning of pass to and fro continually and afford Conveniencies for  Christian  Travellers who either ride upon a  Camel  or a  Dromedary  not unlike it but a little smaller Certain  Bails  of  Merchandize  are bound on either side the Shoul∣ders of the  Beast  and in the hollow thence occasion'd there is plac'd a kind of  Quilt  or  Cushion  whereupon we are oblig'd to ride Crosslegg'd defended from the  Sun  by a large  Canopy of Canvass  purposely erected  'TIS a very toilsome and fatiguing way of Travelling by reason of the native height of  Trott  peculiar to those Creatures who without the smal∣lest sign of discontent will Travel four whole Days together destitute of  Water  but upon occasion can so far exert this  Blessing  of their Nature as to live without it near a Fortnight  The  Caravans  how order'd  THE  Caravans  which pass from  Palestine  to  Egypt  commonly consist of six seven eight nine hundred or a thousand  Persons  with their  Ca∣mels  and  Conveniencies  which we must all provide from the  BrassKettle  to the  FryingPan  if we wou'd Eat or Drink with  Christian Decency  An ad∣mirable  Order  is observ'd among them and continual  Watch  kept Night and  Day to guard the  Caravan  from the  Attacks  and  Robberies  of the  Wild Arabs  who infest the  Desart  and of whom I shall more fully treat when I am come to the Description of their  Laws  and  Ways of Living  Jews  who go to die at  Je∣rusalem  'TIS really a diverting Entertainment for a sprightly  Fancy  to observe what Multitudes of  superstitious Jews  swarm up and down in every  Caravan  the  oldest ugliest  and most  decrepit  of all Mankind who flock from every di∣stant Corner of the  spacious Ʋniverse  to die as near  Jerusalem  as possible and load  themselves  and  other Beasts of Burthen  with the musty Bones and tatter'd Reliques of their  Dead Relations  Three Castles in the De∣sarts  YOU traverse  desart Sands  and  miserable Countries  for about a TenDaysJourney then arrive at  Gaza  in the  HolyLand  first passing by three several  Castles  strongly Garrison'd who claim a certain  Sum  by way of  Toll  from every  Passenger  both for himself and Camels nor is this the only  Trouble  Travellers are subject to for such is the prodigious Power and inhumane Nature of the  upstart Officers  commanding in these Places that they never fail  exacting  with the utmost Insolence and Avarice whatever Force makes easy to their Rapine  The necessity of a Passport from the Ba∣shaw of  Cairo  So that every Stranger who wou'd Travel  unoffen∣ded  from  Grand Cairo  to  Jerusalem  must purchase a  full Passport  from the  Great Bashaw  residing at the  first  of those  two Towns  by which he may be sure of a  Protection  tho' he meets with no  Respect  but if  imprudently  he ventures undefended by the Virtue of  that necessary Safeguard  ten to one the  Persecutions  he must meet with  damp  his  Curiosity  and he returns deep loaden with  Repentance  in the room of  Satisfaction  CHAP XXXIX Of the Present State of the  HolyLand  Palestine  justly call'd Holy by the  Christians  AT last the Reader is arriv'd in  Palestine  the  Land  which anciently was chosen by the Voice of  God  himself for the Possession of a Peo∣ple whom he long distinguish'd by an undeserv'd  Partiality  of Fa∣vour and Affection A Country justly call'd the  Holy Land  by Christian Piety because our  Saviour  bless'd her Cities with his Residence and Conversation and in this  selected Climate  paid the Debt of an assum'd  Humanity  in ignominious Death and bitter Agonies  Not else de∣serving of the Title  BUT far from  Holy  has it ever been if we consider the Rebellious Principles incorrigible strange and unexampled Wickedness of the un∣happy  Jews  her  Old Inhabitants  A Nation disregarding  Laws  impos'd by  God  himself who in their very Sight vouchsaf'd to hold a Conversation with their more Religious Leader the neglected  Moses  The obstinacy of the  Jews  A  Nation  who in midst of the Possession of those show'ring Happinesses consequent to the encreasing favour of their  Great Creator  and deliver'd by amazing Proofs of his Affection nay defended in their  greatest Perils  by a thousand Miracles and oft repeated Marks of the  Almighty  's Mercy I say a Nation who possessing these and many more peculiar  Blessings  could a∣midst their  Obligations  slight their Duty and neglecting Him from whom they boasted all their Fortune deviate from the  Rules  he set before them to the shameful Practices of  black Idolatry  How greatly Punish'd  BUT as the heinous Nature of these Peoples Sins exceeded far the most enormous Crimes of other Nations so does that surprizing  Punishment  in∣flicted on them full as much exceed the Misery which even the most de∣spis'd and wretched Outcasts of the spacious Universe are forc'd to suf∣fer  Strangers in their own Country  ABHORR'D  in the Society and banish'd from the Habitations of Mankind in general they wander miserably up and down possess no  Pro∣perty  and wish no  Excellence  in any  Art  but that of  Cheating  scorn'd and persecuted wheresoe'er they come and  to so shocking a degree  the  TennisBalls  of Fortune and unpity'd Exiles of the World that they are no where greater Strangers than in  Palestine  it self of Old the Right of their sub∣verted Ancestors and making them while they possess'd her not alone the  Pride  but  Terrour  of the Universe  NOT any Country of the  Habitable World  is known to have been sub∣ject to so many Changes or has felt the ill Effects of such stupendious bloody and successive Revolutions as if the  Just AllWise  and Mighty Hand of  Heaven  inflicted never resting Torments on the Place for having been the Scene of our  Redeemer's  Sufferings by the insolent Decrees and obstinate Stupidity of her Inhumane  Natives  Palestine  in the  Turks  Possession  AMONG the many Changes she has felt she groans  at present  under the severest Weight of galling Slavery that ever she was subject to entirely in Possession of the  Turks  and Govern'd by  Bashaws San∣giacks  and  other Officers  in all degrees  presiding  and  exerting  their Autho∣rity as in the other Countries subject to the Government of the  Ʋnli∣mited Grand Signior  How Inhabi∣ted at present  HER Old Inhabitants  Eradicated wholly  by successive Shocks of  War  and  Poverty  have left the Ancient Seats of their Possession to be Peo∣pled by a Mixture of the  Scum  and  Refuse  of most other  Eastern Na∣tions  such as  Greeks Armenians Moors Egyptians  and the like for  Turks  there are but  very few  among them nor would  those  continue there but out of a design to  Plunder  and  exact as much as possible  from the Un∣happy  Wretches  subject to their  Tyranny  The Soil itself Chang'd  NOR is  the once sublime and Flourishing Condition  of her Ancient Government the only thing which time has chang'd to this Surprizing disadvantage  even the Land itself  as if a Curse from  Heaven  attended the detested Climate has disrob'd her  Surface  of those amiable Beauties and attracting Excellencies of Fertility and Prospect which in former times were wont to Crown not only the  Vallies  but the very  Hills  and  Rocks  themselves with a Productive Gayety  Reflections  METHOUGHTS it griev'd me when I trod the Paths which in forgotten Ages have perhaps been trac'd by the repeated Footsteps of the Ancient  Patriarchs  and their Posterity Methoughts I say it griev'd me then to think that Lands  of Old  possess'd by the Religious  Patrons  of  GODS Holy Doctrine  should now be own'd by the Defiling out∣casts of Humanity by Swarms of  Infidels  IT Shock'd me strangely when I cast my Eye  from Hill to Hill  a∣bout the Country and beheld almost on every  Mountain  the remaning Ruins of some  Chalky Fabrick  Mourning as it were its Founders Downfall It shock'd me when I saw such rugged Reliques of o'erturn'd Antiquity and yet by what my Guides inform'd me was oblig'd in looking on them to reflect  there  once stood  Jericho  in all her Grandeur  there Da∣mascus  anciently erected her aspiring Head  there  stood the Fam'd  Metro∣polis  of  Israel  bright  Samaria  and in former Ages  yonder  despicable Heap of Ruins was the Proud  Jerusalem  Moral Re∣flections  OH How can  Man  be led to Flatter his ambitious Passions with the Groundless hopes of  Riches Permanence  or an unshock'd Possession of the Smiles of Fortune when that very Ground is grown a  Dunghill  for the  Filth  of  Nature  which the promises of  Heaven  and the  GOD  of  Abraham  confirm'd to his Posterity with the repeated Character of  a Land that Flow'd with Milk and Honey  and the strong assurances  that it should dwell with  Him  and with his Seed for ever  Bread made of Roots  I know not whether it proceeds from the Defect of Nature in some wondrous Alteration of the Soils Fertility or Universal Negligence or want of skill in those Inhabitants who now possess it to improve it as they ought to do but this is certain that the Land is so extreamly Bar∣ren or Deficient in producing  Corn  that for the space of many  Miles  a∣bout  Jerusalem  the People Eat no other  Bread  than what is made of  Beans  or certain  Roots  of an  Ʋnsavory Relish  but they say of  Mighty Vertue  as to the  Effects  they have on those who Eat them  IT is indeed a Dyet only fit for those mean Slaves whose ab∣ject  Souls  can stoop to Servitude with a regardless Easiness and such alone would condescend to live among such Arbitrary Tyrants as oppress all kinds of People by Extortion and Injustice in this miserable Coun∣try  Rapine en∣courag'd in  Turkey  'TIS true the Practice of unbounded  Rapine  is  allow'd  nay even  en∣courag'd  in the mildest Scenes of  Turkish  Government but here in so particular a manner that Honour Power and Riches can by no means be obtain'd but by the help of such unjust and wicked Courses as by univer∣sal Custom are become not only  safe  but  fashionable  The evil con∣sequences of Example  AND indeed where not alone licentious Education  tolerates  an Evil but an universal Approbation  justifies  its Practice 'tis a Task extreamly difficult for any Man to shun the common Course of  Vice  he sees before him an Evil Conversation and the ill Examples set Mankind deceive their Sen∣ses into an Opinion that such Practices are  just  as they see  common Hence  Injustice is become so natural to the  Turkish  Government and  hence  we find how useful it would be for all young Men to study well the Pre∣cepts of  Theognis  in the following Verses  The Advice of  Theognis  Cyrnus  I'll kindly teach those Rules to Thee  Which  Good Men  taught my unsiedg'd Infancy  Be  Wise  nor  Pow'r  nor  Wealth  nor  Honour  gain  From Deeds whose foul  Injustice  all will stain  Be careful next  Ill Company  to shun  But to a  Good Mans Converse  always run  Eat Drink  and  Sit  with him and still take care  To make your  Court  to such as  Pow'rful  are  From  Good Mens  Conversation  Good  will flow  Whilst with the  Ill  you lose what you already know  PROCEED we now to take a view of the remaining Tokens of Antiquity and Zeal which yet adorn the Modern State of lost  Jeru∣salem  CHAP XL Of  Jerusalem  The Sacred  Antiquities  therein con∣tain'd and the Entertainment of Strangers in the  Christian Monastery  on  MountCalvary  Old  Jerusalem  's Condition  NOW Reader we are come to a description of the celebrated Queen of ancient Cities whose aspiring Turrets rais'd her Pride beyond a  Rival  whose peculiar Blessings spoke her long the Mi∣stress of Command and Glory of the Universe whose impious Walls contain'd the Scene of our  Redeemers  Agonies and shook with Earthquakes at his mighty  Crucifixion  How different from the Mo∣dern  BUT now alas She can no longer boast those Gayeties of Nature and combining Art which swell'd her Excellence in former Ages all those bright and tow'ring Marks of Splendour and Authority are sunk to nothing Rocky Barrenness now stares a Stranger wildly in the Face where  once  he might have charm'd his Senses with a glitt'ring Prospect of refin'd Mag∣nificence and craggy Precipices in the very midst of this depopulated Scene of Sorrow seem to groan out in complaining Murmurs  Mortal Glory cometh up and is cut down like a Flower and passeth away like a Shadow and is no more seen  Reflections on  Jerusalem  OH Poor unhappy City  Great even in the Memory  of what thou once wert thought deserving of how fully hast thou seen accomplish'd the Prophetic Sentence of thy  Crucified Director  Oh how much better had it been for thy deluded Natives to have listen'd gratefully to the repeated  Woes  denounc'd against them Then had thy splendid Temple stood unshock'd and not expos'd to verifie a Sentence which had she de∣serv'd no Overthrow had never been inflicted  Math  ch v  Verily verily I say unto you there shall not be left here one Stone upon another that shall not be thrown down  HOW evident alas are all thy Miseries how vainly dost thou groan in an unpitied Ruin and how stupidly inactive must be that Man's Fan∣cy who beholding thee surrounded by thy present  Curses  does not mournfully reflect how much in vain our Tender  Saviour  pitied thy Mis∣fortunes when he breath'd these piercing Proofs of Heavenly Compassion mildly over thee  Math  ch v  O  Jerusalem Jerusalem  thou that killest the Prophets and stonest them which are sent unto thee how often would I have gather'd thy Children together even as a Hen gathereth her Chickens under her Wings  and ye would not  Behold your House is left unto you desolate  THE Shocking Weight of those  Oppressions  thou art subject to give lively proofs of the just cause our  Blessed Saviour  had to say  Weep not for me but for your selves O ye Daughters of  Jerusalem  New Jerusa∣lem  how Si∣tuated  MODERN  Jerusalem  has Chang'd her Situation from the very Ground on which the old one stood for when she Flourish'd in her An∣cient Grandeur  Mount Moriah  and  Mount Sion  stood directly in the Center of the City and the  Mount  call'd  Calvary  the  Place of Crucifixion  was without the  Northern Gate  at a considerable distance but the  New Jerusalem  is built so much more towards the  North  that  Sion  is with∣out the Wall upon the  Southside  of the  Modern City  and  Mount Calva∣ry  now stands almost directly in the  Middle  The Castle of  Jerusalem  UPON the Right Hand of the  Western Gate  there stands an Old Decay'd  Castle  inconsiderately  Garrison'd  and Mounted with a useless Number of  Great Pieces of Artillery  The Walls and Gates how Forti∣fy'd  THE Walls are Weak and all the  Town  much stronger by her Natural Situation than the Art wherewith she has of late been  For∣tify'd  the  Gates  are Guarded by a constant Number of  Foot Soldiers  and defended by the largest of their  Cannon  the Remaining  Houses  for I cannot say there is a  Street  now standing are of very low and humble  Fabrick  Built of  Mud  and not exceeding one  Poor Story  widely Straggling from each other and without the smallest sign of  Or∣der  or an  aim  of  Regularity  SOME broken Remnants of old Buildings which the  Natives  tell us were the  Palace of King David Theatre of Herod  and the like serve only to remind a  Traveller  that  once Jerusalem was  what she  now is not  No  Jews  suf∣fer'd to Inha∣bit  Jerusalem  No  Jews  are suffer'd to Inhabit here the Town being wholly Peopled by  Zealous Christian Bigotts  of promiscuous Nations and such  Turks  as Dwelling there in hopes to use an Arbitrary Power to the best advantage are  Subservient  to the Government of a  Sangiack  or  De∣puty Provincial  SINCE then there is not any thing uncommon in the form of Go∣vernment here practis'd and abundance of our Modern Writers have de∣scrib'd the Place with  Geographic Nicety  and as for the Historical Ac∣counts thereof they are already fully known I'll purposely omit the Naming any thing but what is shown most Travellers as Reliques of An∣tiquity which I believe is what an  English Reader  will receive most welcomely at least 'tis what I chiefly aim'd at in this Treatise and will consequently lead me into no Unnecessary Deviation from the Te∣nour of my Subject  FIRST then I will inform my Reader what we see within  Jerusalem  and round about it not including the  Franciscan Monastery  on  Mount Calvary  or near it Secondly at large describe both that the  Sepulchre of Christ  the  Temple over it  and every other thing worth No∣tice thereunto belonging  The Father Guardian why so call'd  I should First inform you that the  Chief  of the  Franciscan Monastery  is Entitled to the Name of  Father Guardian  from the Privilege he has of granting his Protection to all  Christian Travellers  whether  Protestants  or  Roman Catholicks  who are constantly oblig'd as long as they continue in the City to take up with a  Monastick Entertainment  in the  Convent  for a Stranger not of the  Mahometan Perswasion  is not suffer'd to reside in any of the  Turkish Houses  or indeed in any other Corner of  Jerusalem  THe Convent at  Jerusalem  how main∣tain'd  THE  Europaean Princes  of the  Romish Church  contribute largely towards the Maintenance of these  Religious Fryars  who expect Rewards of far more worth than is the Entertainment which they give to Travellers and least such Gentlemen as Curiosity has led to see  Jerusalem  should possibly be ignorant of what is still expected from their Purses they are ever careful by repeated Declaration of their Poverty and Want of  Christian Charity  on all occasions to insinuate how welcomely they would receive a generous Gratuity  How the Fry∣ars live there  THUS live they easily in flowing Plenty using all the pampering Gifts of  Liberal Nature  with an unreserv'd and gratifying  Luxury  which is so fully known to the designing  Turkish Governors  that they are seldom found to miss the smallest Opportunity of  squeezing  their Possessions to the best Advantage  A Ceremony us'd to Stran∣gers  THESE Politic  Franciscans  vers'd politely in the well dissembled Pra∣ctice of a great Humility receive all  Strangers  with a wonderful respect the  Father Guardian  always condescending by a long continued Custom to  kneel down  and  Wash  their Feet while others  Wipe  them many of the  Order  standing round devoutly Singing certain  Hymns  appointed for that purpose  How they are treated  AFTER this a certain Number of the  Fryars  are directed by their  Padre  to accompany the Strangers  up and down within  the City and  without  and shew them every Place worth observation which they con∣stantly perform with  admirable Artifice  appearing wond'rous Civil and exciting those they guide to think their  Curiosity  a  Meritorious Zeal  in hopes thereby that others may at their return to their respective Countries be induc'd to undertake a Journey  thither  and by that means swell the  Perquisites  of their Dependance to additional Abundance  A Question always ask'd at  Jerusalem  IT is a Question always ask'd if you design your  Visit  to those  Holy Places  from a Motive of  Religious Zeal  or  Common Curiosity  If from the  first  they pester you with  Beads  and other superstitious  Tokens  of Devotion which direct the strict Injunction of repeating two four six eight ten or twenty  Pater Nosters  at such and such  more  Sacred or  less  Holy Pla∣ces but if you  assure  them that the  latter Motive  tempted you to Travel thither they are complaisantly  passive  in the matter and accompany you about from  Place to Place  without observing your  Deportment  in them  A Register kept in the Monastery  THE  Fryars  of this  Monastery  keep a  Register  wherein they enter both the Names and Country of such  Travellers  as visit the renown'd  Jerusalem  It is impossible to know exactly the just number of our Countrymen who have been there because the different Inclinations of some Men engage them to pretend themselves  Italians  when they are really  Spaniards French Men  when they are  Britons  and renounce their Countries for some ends which they believe most prudent  How many  English men  have been there these hundred Years  HOWEVER we were suffer'd to look back upon the  Books  which have been kept these hundred Years last past and found there enter'd to the best of my Remembrance One Hundred and Ninety Eight who  since that time  have in their Travels from the  English Shore  had  Will  and  Op∣portunity  to see  Jerusalem  THE Sacred  Reliques  Ancient  Buildings  or whatever else deserves  Re∣mark  are these which follow eagerly asserted by the  Priests  to be the same whose  Reputation  they have taken on them  Herod  's Palace  THE glorious Palace of the haughty  Herod  speaks in a  Decay  not quite so bad as  Ruin  the unbounded  Pride  of its Imperious  Founder  There still remain some Rooms entirely whole particularly that wherein he us'd to sit  Enthron'd  beneath a  Canopy  and list'ned to the Business of his numerous  Addressers  near which they show another  Square  but low Roof'd Chamber where our  Saviour Christ  derided by the  Scoffs  of Impious  Vil∣lains  was saluted on the  Knee  with the  Ironical  Address of  Hail King of the Jews  SOME stately Arches prove the  Architecture  to have been  Magnificent  and  Lofty  and the Place is now so well repair'd that 'tis the Residence of the  Sangiack  or  Turkish Governor  Solomon's  Tem∣ple  THEY show a Building which they call the  Temple of Solomon  but are neither suffer'd to  go in themselves  or  gain Admittance  for a  Christian Tra∣veller  not even tho'  Bribery  an almost never failing Orator among the  Turks  should plead for the Permission  Pontius Pilate  's House  THE House of  Pontius Pilate  still remains and there they show the Place where stood our  Saviour  when they crown'd him with the  Thorns  and bound him to a  Pillar  which supported the Apartment But oh shocking Thought and strange Effect of  Times  vast  Changes  that very Place where  Christ  was Scourg'd by the Command of  Pilate  is at present made a Shop where an Old Man of Seventy Years of Age frys  Cakes in Oyl  and sells them in the Street to  Common People  The Pool of  Bethesda  INCLINING to the  Eastside  of the City stands the Celebrated  Pool  of  Bethesda  now almost dry'd up and fill'd with Rubbish where the  Angel  formerly descended and by troubling the  Waters  made them  efficaci∣ous  in the Cure of  Great Diseases  The melan∣choly Way  WITH  melancholy Sighs  we walk'd along the  melancholy Way  thro' which our  Saviour  pass'd o'erloaden with the Burthen of his  Cross  in or∣der to the Tragedy of his stupendious  Crucifixion  Here we pass by an old Ruinated Place where liv'd the Pious  Veronica  who beheld when  Christ  went by that he was fainting with his  Load  and brought him out a Nap∣kin to wipe off the  Sweat  from his afflicted Face which  Napkin  amongst other  Reliques  is retain'd and shown to Strangers in the  Chappel  of the  Mo∣nastery  The Houses of  Simon  and  La∣zarus  NEXT stand almost  contiguous  to each other two old heaps of  Buil∣ding  in the  first  whereof they say liv'd  Lazarus  whom  Christ  restor'd to Life when he had long been buried and the  other  they report to have been formerly the Habitation of that  Simon  who perceiving  Jesus  faint before his Door took up the  Cross  and bore it for him to the Place of  Exe∣cution  The  Virgins Chappel  HARD by there stands a  Chappel  Dedicated to the  Virgin Mary  where they say she stood to see her  Son  go by in order to be  Crucifi'd  and  Swoon'd  when she beheld him  St  Peter  's Pri∣son  THE Prison where St  Peter  was confin'd is still remaining and em∣ploy'd at present by the  Turks  for the same Purpose Here they show a  Hole  cut deeply in the  Wall  to which they would ridiculously force you to believe the  Chain  was fastned which was us'd in binding the Im∣prison'd  Saint  abovenam'd and not far distant from this Place they show a Remnant of the  Judgment Gate  thro' which our  Saviour  was conducted to the Sentence of his  Condemnation  The House of  Annas  THEY show the House wherein our  Saviour  visiting one  Annas  then its Owner stumbling accidentally and almost falling down a little  Precipice  in order to support himself laid hold on the  sharp Corner  of a  Wall  the Stones whereof to this Day bear a Mark which represents the  Print  of his  four Fingers  if we may depend on the Assurances our  Fryars  gave us  A miracu∣lous Stone  THE House of  Simon  the  Pharisee  contains a  Stone  whereon appears the  Print  of a  Man's Foot  the  Mark  they told us which our  Saviour  made when standing on it he forgave the  Sins  of  Mary Magdalene  It seems the Sacred  Vertues  of this  Stone  are so extraordinary that tho' the  Turks  have frequently attempted to remove it from its Place it has not only strangely baffled all their Efforts but when once the  Governor himself  a mighty E∣nemy to any who profess'd  Christianity  endeavour'd it with Obstinacy  Flames of Fire  broke fiercely from the Floor and scorch'd away his  Reso∣lution  The Room where the  Virgin Mary  was born  BENEATH the Hollow of a certain  Rock  on which was built the House of  Joahim  and  Anna  there is shown a small low square Apartment where was born the  Virgin Mary  as the  Fathers  told us  St  Mark  and St  James  THEY show the  Ruins  of a little Chappel situated where St  Mark  once liv'd and not far from it a small  Church  first founded by the  Spani∣ards  in Commemoration of St  James  and Dedicated to him for  I think  they say it stands upon the  Ground  on which he was  Beheaded  THESE as far as I remember are the most remarkable of all the  Places  we were shown  within  the City I will now proceed to give you an Account of  others  equally deserving Observation which are found without the  Walls  at several distances  A Monastery in the Place where Jesus met the two Disciples in the Road to  Emaus  IN the Road to  Emaus Westward  of  Jerusalem  near  Six Miles  there stands a  Monastery  founded by the  Pious Empress Helena  directly on the Place where  Jesus  met his  two Disciples  Not far from hence they show a  Valley  where they say was fought the  famous Battle  before which the  Sun  and  Moon  stood still at the desire of  Joshua  The Sepul∣chre of the Prophets  AT five Miles distance from the  NorthWestGate  are several  Hollow Caves  cut deeply in the bottom of large  Rocky Mountains  one whereof was formerly the  Sepulchre  of the Inspir'd and Celebrated  Jewish  Pro∣phets  The Burying Place of the Kings of  Judah  ALMOST directly opposite to that remains the  Burying Place  of the Renown'd and Formidable Kings of  Judah  which is enter'd by a square De∣scent of near five Foot each way  A narrow Passage  THIS leads us thro' a Passage somewhat narrower and still descending with no little difficulty by reason of great heaps of Rubbish driven by Time to choak the  Entrance  The Passage fifteen Foot in length is ter∣minated by a broad and lofty Level Arch'd above and Bench'd tho' roughly upon either side  A wonderful Door  THE end of this large Place which I may term a  Gallery  admits you to a very wide and graceful  Chamber  which you must descend to from the  Gallery  by two or three  StoneSteps  of admirable  Workmanship  This  Cham∣ber  has a  Door  belonging to it which we found quite open of an exquisite Contrivance made entirely of the  Rock it self  with  Hinges  of the same on which it moves tho' of prodigious  Weight  and  Bulk  with an  incredible facility  ON either side the  Chamber  into which you are admitted by the  three Stone Steps  abovenam'd stand the  Monuments  of such as formerly were bu∣ried there the Number is considerable and the Order they are rang'd in very regular  Description of the  Tombs  THE  Tombs  are form'd alike and of a Magnitude exactly equal They are smaller otherwise they differ little from the  Monument  of  Porphyry  I mention'd in the Chapter of the  Pyramids  of  Egypt  some retain their Covers still upon them others have been open'd by the eager Curiosity of  Christian Travellers  Characters within them  UPON the insides of them all we found  Decypher'd  certain unintelligi∣ble  Characters  which could we have interpreted their meaning might have probably inform'd us who was buried in each Stony and Capacious  Hollow  That they were the Kings of  Juda  we have no great cause to dis∣believe but that among them were Interr'd King  David  and his  Son  the Mighty  Solomon  as the too credulous Inhabitants of  Palestine  are taught by their  Tradition  appears too widely distant from the reach of Probabili∣ty to fix a Reputation on the groundless Notion  The Corps found in them  HOWEVER it is certain that at breaking open any of these  Tombs  we may be sure to find the Body of a Man  Embalm'd  and  Ʋncorrupted  but extreamly different from the  Mummies  found in the  Egyptian Catacombs  for these are so incredibly diminish'd both in Bulk and  Stature  that they scarce retain the bare  Resemblance  of the  Shape  they once were Masters of  A melancholy Sight  THE broken Pieces and disjointed Bones left carelesly about the bot∣tom of some  Tombs  afford a very odd and melancholy Prospect and in others the remaining Firmness of the jointless Bodies Light and Thin like some dry'd Fish which I have seen in  England  gave our  Thoughts  a mourn∣ful Subject for the following  Contemplations  Contemplati∣ons on it  Is  this  alas our boasted  Mortal State  Is it for  this  we covet to be  Great  What  Happiness  from  envied Grandeur  springs  When these  poor Reliques  once were mighty  Kings  O Frail  Ʋncertainty  of Human  Power  While  Graves  can  Majesty it self  devour  While  Death  distinguishes nor  Sex  nor  Birth  And  Regal Graces  moulder into  Earth  Alas how  strange  how  sad  a  Change  is here  In what a  Dress  does  Royalty  appear  O where is  now  the  Globe  of thy  Command  Or where the  Scepter  that adorn'd  this Hand  Where's  now  the  Crown  which  once  these  Temples  bound  Or where those  trailing Robes  which swept the  Ground  Where are those  brawny Guards  which aw'd thy  State  And where those  cringing Crowds  which  once  were proud to  wait  Are those  thin Jaws  the  same  which us'd to treat  Thy  Pamper'd Palate  with such  Choice  of  Meat  Can  narrow Limits  such as  these  contain  The  chang'd Extent  of thy  once  larger Reign  Canst  Thou  at whose  least Frown  a  Nation shook  And dreaded  Lightning  from thy  stormy Look  Canst  Thou  alas be  passively Content  To let  Intruders  search thy  Monument  Thou  who wert  once too Great  for  Vulgar Touch  Can thy  Proud Majesty  be  chang'd so much  That  Common Men  unknown to  Kings  like you  Thus  poize  you  turn  you round and  wonder  at the view  Bethlehem  how Situated  WEST  from  Jerusalem  about six Miles stands the Renown'd and Ancient  Bethlehem  our  Redeemers  Birthplace and upon the  Road  which leads you to it you are made to observe the following  Reliques  of  Antiqui∣ty  by your Guides the  Fryars  who attend you thither  Solomons A∣quaeduct  THE Ruins of a Great and Noble  Aquaeduct  which formerly brought Water to the Celebrated Temple of the Glorious  Solomon  appear between two  Rocky Mountains  every here and there delightfully conspicuous high above the Superficies of a Flow'ry Valley  Bathsheba's Fountain  THE Fountain where  Bathsheba  Wash'd her self when  David  spy'd her from a Neighbouring  Turret  still continues extant or at least a Spring in∣heriting its Reputation by the Virtue of  Tradition  and a little higher on the  Summit  of the utmost Corner of  Mount Sion  stand the Ruins of the  Tower  whence she was discover'd by that  Powerfull Monarch  Elias  's  Rock  ANOTHER Rarity they show most Travellers is a large Rock whereon they zealously affirm the Prophet  Elias  us'd to Sleep and to con∣firm the Story they oblige us to take Notice of some Natural Hollows which are found upon the  Rock  Created as they say by the Miraculous Impression that the  Prophets Body  made in his repeated Slumbers  Jacob's  House  THE Ruins of a  Church  or  Monastery  point out the Ground whereon in former Ages stood the  House  of the  Old Patriarch Jacob  and the  Tomb  of  Rachel  stands within Six  Furlongs  of this Place not far from which the Town of  Rama  where the  Voice was heard of  Rachel  Weeping for her Chil∣dren  still continues a considerable  Village  THESE and many other Rarities of venerable Age and Sacred Vir∣tue if the  Priests  may be believ'd upon their  Verbum Sacerdotis  give a Stranger frequent Opportunities of Gazing round him in the Road which lies between  Jerusalem  and  Bethlehem  to which last however we are now arriv'd  A Temple Built by  He∣lena  at  Beth∣lehem  DIRECTLY in the Place where stood the  Inn  in one of whose  Mean Stables  the neglected  Virgin Mary  was oblig'd to lie when she so greatly Bless'd the  Sinfull World  in our  Dear Saviour  Christ's  Nativity  the  Pious Helena  that Happy Mother of the  Glorious Constantine  Erected long time since a Stately  Temple  representing in its form the Figure of a  Cross  near which is Built a little  Monastery  now possess'd by certain  Fryars  of  Franciscan Order  and in all kinds of the same  Fraternity  with those I men∣tion'd in the  Convent  at  Jerusalem  Three dismal Grotto's  THEY give all Strangers  Torches  in their Hands and lead them thro' a Narrow Dark and Winding Passage to  three several Grotto's one  a  Vault  wherein they say the  Children  Murder'd by the  barbarous decree  of  Herod  were thrown  Headlong  to be Buried and within the  second  stand the  Tombs  of good  St Jerom  and his  Scholar  fam'd  Eusebius  the  Confessor  The  last Cave  containing nothing but a  Monument  erected o'er the  Grave  of the  Fair Convert Paula  a great  Roman Lady  of the Noblest  Extract  who to∣gether with her  Son Eustochius  was Interr'd at  Bethlehem  were she Built  Four Monasteries  and endow'd them Richly which are  now  entirely Ruin'd  The Birth Place and Manger of  Christ  WITHIN a little space of the abovenam'd  Grotto's  you descend to a large  Chappel  flagg'd with Marble Gilt and Ornamented in the richest manner Here they show the very  Spot  of Ground whereon the  Virgin  was deliver'd of her  Son  the  Holy Jesus  with the  Manger  into which she laid him and the  Place  where 'tis reported that the  Wise Men  of the  East  directed  thither  by a  Star  knelt down and Worshipp'd whilst they offer'd up their  Presents  Jacob  's Mea∣dow  IT is at  Bethlehem  that they show the  Field  where  Jacob  sed his  Flock  and where the  Angels  visiting the  Shepherds  ravish'd them with the tran∣sporting  News  of our  Great Saviours  bless'd  Nativity  The Field to this Day bears the Name of  Jacob's Meadow  Joseph  's House  NOT a Mile without the  Town  they show the  House  where  Joseph  liv'd before he fled to  Egypt  and the  Cave  wherein he hid the  Virgin  and her  Son  while he prepar'd Conveniences for his intended Jour∣ney  Many other Places worth Remark  BESIDES the  Places  which I have already mention'd there are many others equally deserving Observation but as twou'd oblige me to an inexcusable Prolixity should I so much as  name  them all I will omit en∣larging any farther than to give you a Description of some certain things which justly claim the Reader's Notice who may rest assur'd that not one memorable Place in  Scripture  has escap'd the Knowledge of the  zealous Romans  and  Bigotted Christians  of some other  Churches  who will boldly un∣dertake to show you almost every thing you possibly can ask for  Acceldama  or the Field of Blood  SOƲTH  of  Jerusalem  and not far distant from the  Walls  thereof is that curs'd Piece of Ground  of Old Acceldama  the  Field of Blood  a Purchase made by the reward of Villany return'd again by the repenting  Judas  This in former Times the Scriptures tell us was employ'd as a  Receptacle  for the Dead Bodies of all kind of Strangers  A Burying Place for  Christians  NOR has Time had Power to change the  Ʋse  to which it was or∣dain'd so long ago 'Tis still the common  Burying Place  of all those  Chri∣stians  undistinguish'd by the Name of  Franks  that is all such as are the  Subjects  or at least the  Tributary Slaves  of the  Grand Signior  How Wall'd round  THE Field is all enclos'd by a  Stone Wall  of mighty thickness Roof'd with Art so very closely that there is no  Passage  to the  Soil  within it but by certain  Holes  considerably broad which rise like  Cupola  's upon the top and are from time to time set open in a different Place to let down such Dead Bodies as have  right  to be Interr'd within that  Compass  Corps that rot in a days time  where the Earth is certainly endued with such a  penetrative Virtue  that in two Days time the Soundest Body of a  Man  or  Woman  will be eaten to a  Ske∣leton  TO search the Causes which may probably produce this odd Effect is devious from my Subject I will therefore only tell you that the  Stench  is so offensive that 'tis no agreable Amusement to inspect that  horrid Mansion  of  Corruption  yet we ventur'd to look down the  Hole  which then stood open and discover'd as distinctly as the  Places Duskiness  cou'd possibly permit the lately buried Bodies of some six or seven Persons  A horrid Prospect  four of which were so far  Skeletons  that there appear'd the  shless Bones  in many Places and the rest were coming on to such degree that they appear'd  half rotten  and afforded such a  strange  and  dismal Spectacle  that we were frighted from the  Thoughts  of an  exact Remark  or  curious Observation  Shiploads of Earth  THE  Roman Catholicks  have frequently Exported whole  Shiploads  of this prodigious Soil which has been long known publickly at  Rome  and  Paris  and at  Pisa  I my self have seen a  ChurchYard  cover'd four Foot deep therewith in which they us'd to  bury  Persons only of an  high Di∣stinction  Other Sepul∣chres  BESIDES the  Sepulchres  abovenam'd all the Rocks  for a considerable distance round this Place  are full of  Caves  against the Mouth of every one of which is roll'd a  Stone  of ponderous Magnitude according to the ancient  Custom  mention'd in the  Holy Scriptures  IT wou'd be endless to enumerate the many venerable Places shown a  Traveller  on every side without  Jerusalem  I'll only therefore say  in general  that we  saw  them all but took a more than  common Notice  of the following  Places  Memorable Places  THE  Valley  of  Jehosaphat  the  Old Oak Roguel  the  Pool  of  Siloa  the  Se∣pulchre  of  Zachariah  and the stately Pillar which was built by  Absalom  with a design to  eternize  his Memory before the  Period  of his  black Rebel∣lion  Other memo∣rable Places  WE likewise saw  Mount Olivet  the famous  Gethsemane  and the Gar∣den where our  Blessed Saviour  was betray'd by  Judas  with the Place whereon he Pray'd in his amazing  Agony  the  Village Bethany  the Place where the Repenting  Judas  was Interr'd and a  Remainder  of the Tree whereon he  hang'd  himself  Bethphage  the Place where once stood  Bethphage  a consi∣derable Village whence our  Saviour  on an  Asses Colt  came riding to  Jerusa∣lem  LET these suffice to give the Reader an  Idea  of the Entertainment  Christian Travellers  receive who led by  Curiosity  or sometimes  Zeal  en∣gage the  Fryars  to direct their  Notice  to the most considerable Reliques of  esteem'd Antiquity  Helena  's Temple  Proceed we now to take a  View  of the beforenam'd  Temple  founded on  Mount Calvary  a very low but craggy  Hill  all cut and polish'd from its  ancient Form  for the Conveniency of Building this Il∣lustrious Temple which was left by the Religious  Helena  a  memorable Monu∣ment  of the  Respect  she bore  profess'd Christianity  Its Situation  THE Temple is Magnificent and covers not the  Hill  alone but a consi∣derable  Part  of the surrounding  Plain  one side whereof was  that  into whose unfrequented Wildnesses the  ancient Jews  were us'd to throw the stripp'd  Dead Bodies  of their  Executed Malefactors  from which common Custom it receiv'd the  Name  it bore of  Old  when it was call'd the Valley of  Car∣casses  Its Descripti∣on  THE finest Buildings of the Temple  front  the  South  the Roof thereof is Arch'd and stately Ornamented in two Places by a couple of indifferently large but somewhat ruinated  Cupola's  the  one  to be ascended by a kind of  StairCase  on the outward side the  other  open at the  Top  and rising from the  Chappel  which encompasses the  Sepulchre  of  Christ  Two Tombs  YOU pay a certain Sum of Money to the  Turkish Officers  who grant a  Licence  for your  Entrance  which you have no sooner made than you per∣ceive upon your  Right Hand  an  Old Fashion'd Tomb  and on your  Left  ano∣ther which enclose the  Bodies  of the  famous Godfrey  of  Bulloigne  and  King Baldwin  his  Successor  the two first  Christian Monarchs  of Redeem'd  Jeru∣salem  UPON the Tomb of  Godfrey  on the  Right Hand  as I said before is found the following  Latin Epitaph  Godfrey  of  Bul∣l  's

ALAS IN THIS SMALL TOMB IS SHUT FROM DAY  The Rent in the Rock  NOT far from those two Monuments you rise upon  Mount Calvary  and  there  are shown the Cleaving of the Rock which split asunder at our  Saviour  's  Crucifixion  naturally rough and plainly proving  Art  could have no hand in the  prodigious Rent  wherein they tell us was discover'd  Adam's Head  which had been buried there unknown to  Mortals  till the Death of  Jesus  Christian  Chappels  FARTHER in the Temple there are many  Chappels  or  Divisions  constantly Inhabited by several  different Sects  of  Christians  who imagining it is a very meritorious Act to spend their Lives within the  Temple  of the  Holy Sepulchre embrace  Confinement and  possess  Apartments independent each on other never stirring but on great Occasions from the  Altars  of their  Worship  The Hole wherein was plac'd the Cross of  Christ  THE highest of these  Chappels Chequer'd over  with a various colour'd Marble which they will not let you  walk upon  with Shooes is built upon the very  Spot  of Ground on which our  Saviour  suffer'd on the  Cross  the Hollow of the Rock wherein the  Cross  was plac'd remains unbroken rich∣ly Plated with the  finest Silver gilt  and piercing thro' the midst of a large  Remnant  of the  Cliff  which was not cut away at the  Foundation  of the  Chappel  but continues whole near half a Yard above the  Superficies  of the  Marble Pave∣ment  The Ceremo∣nies there perform'd by Pilgrims  HERE it is that  Christian Pilgrims  in a  zealous Extacy  are seen to pra∣ctise  Airs  and  Postures  not much differing from down right Madness rol∣ling  up and down  with strange Extravagance endeavouring to creep as near the  Hole  as possibly they can  Embracing Kissing  and  half Deluging  with  Tears  the solid Stones as if they knew them  not  to be  insensible  and would extract a  Sympathetic Sorrow  from their  Rocky Hardness  The two Thieves Crosses  ON either side of the abovenam'd  Hole  there stands a  Cross  directly in the Places where the  Thieves  who suffer'd with our  Saviour  hung in  Cru∣cifixion Here  as in the other  Chappels  of the  Temple  they adorn the Sides and Roof with a considerable Stock of  ever burning Lamps  the melancho∣ly Air of which Appearance helps to strike a  Sacred Terrour  thro' the Breasts of  all  who enter  The Place where  Christ  was nail'd up∣on the Cross  ANOTHER Chappel enter'd thro' the  former  brings you to the Place where  Christ  was  laid  upon the  Ground  and  nail'd  as usual upon the  Cross  he Died on On the  Floor  which is compos'd of  many colour'd Mar∣bles  you perceive the Figure of the  Cross  directly as the  Priests  assur'd us in the Place whereon lay  that  which  this  is but design'd to represent the  Form  of  Here  again the  Pilgrims  of  both Sexes  exercise their  Vigour  in those zealous kind of Motions I describ'd so lately  Another Sa∣cred Place  WITHIN a little distance from these Places you are shown a  Marble Stone  which covers  as they say  that very  Spot  of Ground whereon the  Virgin Mary  stood when from the  Cross  our  Saviour  recommended  her  and his  be∣lov'd Disciple  to a mutual Love  from that time forward  The Sepul∣chre of  Christ  how enclos'd  YOU pass by many little  Chappels  thro' abundance of large Pillars to the  Sepulchre  of  Christ  enclos'd by a small  Temple  upon which is built the open  Cupola  I  lately  mention'd the Wood  thereof  is  Cedar  and the  Chappel  quite surrounded by a  Range  of Cornish'd Marble Pillars standing close a∣gainst the  Wall  and  thence  affording something that deserves the  Name  of  Ornament  Description of the Sepul∣chre  DIRECTLY in the midst appears the  Sepulchre  of our  Blessed Saviour  hewn by  manual Labour  in the Rock it self near two Yards long and one in breadth 'Twas  anciently  expos'd to Publick View Unpolish'd and in native roughness but is  now  politely cover'd with a  spacious Marble  to pre∣serve it from the zealous Robberies of such  Religious Pilgrims  as imputing a Miraculous Effect to the  Possession  of such  Holy Reliques  often us'd to break away small Pieces of the  Rocky Sepulchre  Plac'd in a narrow Space  THE  Tomb  not quite a  Yard  in  Height  enclos'd in such a  narrow space  as scarce affords  sufficient room  for four to  Kneel  is  now  converted to an  Altar  Ornamented  brightly  with a constant Number of  fine Lamps  the dark Ef∣fects of whose  perpetual Smoak  have daub'd the Roof with an unsightly  Blackness  The Stone which the Angel roll'd away  NEAR the Entrance in the Middle of the  Floor  there lies a  Stone  near two Foot square whereon  some  say the  Angels  sat when they declar'd that  Christ  was risen  Others  wou'd perswade us to believe 'twas  that  which had been roll'd against the  Entrance  of the  Sepulchre  according to the  Jewish Custom  tho' they show'd us  in another Place  a Stone which has  with more success  assum'd  that Reputation  The Pillar of Christ's Scourging  NOT far from hence they show the  remnant  of a  broken Pillar  which is said to be a  Part  of  that  whereto they bound  our Saviour  while they scourg'd him 'Tis four foot long and  vein'd  with  dusky Clouds  but sprinkled on one side with certain  Spots  of  reddish Colour  which they would perswade us to believe were made by the most  precious Blood  of the  Revil'd  and  Tortur'd Jesus  The Honour paid the Re∣lique  THIS Relique is enclos'd within an  Iron Grate  thro' which it must be touch'd by  nothing  but a certain  Stick  the  Priests  provide you with which being  thence  immediately convey'd to  Pilgrims Mouths  is  stedfastly  believ'd of never failing  Power  to infuse a certain  balmy Virtue  to the  Soul  of  Him  who  blesses  his  internal Faculties  by kissing eagerly the  holy Stick  which has been honour'd with the Touch of such a Sacred  Relique  Knights of the Sepulchre  THERE was a Custom Instituted in the Year  One Thousand  and  Ninety Nine  of Constituting  Gentlemen Knights of the Sepulchre  by knee∣ling on the Place and taking  there  a certain Oath to be Eternal  Champions  of the  Church  of  Christ  and lead a  Life  sincerely  Pious  and continue  Mem∣bers  of the  Roman Catholick Religion  which with certain other  Ceremonies  such as  girding  on  a Sword  and hanging a Gold  Cross  about his  Neck  being perform'd by the  Father Guardian  of the  Franciscan Monastery  upon  Mount Cal∣vary  he rises  Dignify'd  with that  Religious Quality  By whom In∣stituted  THE Sovereigns of this  once respected Order  were the  Kings of France  who Instituted it Originally but when the Avarice of the  Priests  inclin'd them to accept of any Man  how mean soever  who desir'd the Honour of this  Sacred Knighthood  cou'd he but afford to bribe them highly it became at last so very  Common  that 'twas  disregarded  by degrees  Now almost disus'd  and now is very rarely  practis'd  or so much as  sought for  Christs Pri∣son  THEY show a little low and darksome  Grotto  hewn but roughly in the Body of the Rock wherein they say  our Saviour  was confin'd betwixt the  Hour  of his  Sentence  and  Moment  of his  Crucifixion  The Place where they cast Lots for his Garments  HERE likewise is the Place wherein the  Soldiers  cast their  Lotts  ac∣cording to the Custom  then  in Practice with the  Jews  for our condemn'd  Redeemer's  Garments Not far from thence the  bottom  of a tedious narrow  pair  of  Stairs  cut also from the  Rock it self  admits you to a kind of  Gallery  supported by four  Marble Pillars  of a  greyish Colour  which for ever sweating or emitting a perpetual Moisture by the native  Dampness  of the  subterraneous  Place wherein they stand are shown to  Strangers  for a Miracle  Weeping Pil∣lars  and said to Weep with Sorrow for our  Saviour's Crucifixion  The Place where they found the Cross  UPON the  Southern side  of  Calvary  eleven Stone Stairs admit you to a Vault which  Helena  first founded on that Part of the  Valley  of  Carcasses  wherein among vast  heaps  of  Rubbish Bones of Men  and  Mossy Stones  they found the  Cross  of Christ and  those  of the  two Thieves  who had been  Cru∣cified  with him after they had lain unthought of and forgotten full  three hundred Years  or  somewhat upwards  The Conclu∣sion  I think that having said thus much it wou'd be  needlessly Prolix  to  tire  the Reader with additional Relations little else deserving a  peculiar Obser∣vation  gives me opportunity to swell the  Subject  I have dwelt so long up∣on and which when I beheld the  numerous Scenes  of our  Redeemers  Suffer∣ings possess'd my Bosom with an  ardent Flame  of  Zeal  for that Religion he so dearly fix'd amongst us by his  Death  and  Passion  GRANT  Indulgent God of my Desires  that I may long retain a  fresh Idea  of those moving  Scenes  which stirr'd the  Passions  of my  melting Nature  to a lively Sense of  Duty and Affection  for that  Compassionate  and  Tender Sa∣viour  who descended from his  Father  to assume the  Frailties  of a  Weak Humanity  and Died for the  Offences  of an undeserving Race of  stub∣born Sinners  Nothing more worth viewing  NOTHING after you have seen all this can tempt your Stay in sad  Jerusalem  you therefore take your leave of the  Franciscan Fryers  who pretend an humble  Condescention  to all kinds of People but have often gi∣ven  demonstrative occasion  to the  Protestants  who Travel thither to mistrust the Truth of their  fairfronted Compliments  by the Miscarriage of some  Englishmen  whole Companies of whom have  Died within one Week  I fear by other Motives than the Complaisant Intention of accompanying one another to  the other side Mortality  CHAP XLI Of the  Cities  of  Palestine  as they now are  I NOW proceed to let the Reader know that  such  as is  Jerusalem  just now describ'd  such  also are the  other Cities  of this miserable Coun∣try  Once  they flourish'd in a State of  Glory  if not  equal  yet not much  inferior  to their fam'd  Metropolis  But  now like Her  subverted and dis∣rob'd of ancient Beauties they exhibit to the  View  of every  Traveller  a me∣lancholy Cause of Contemplation on the Changes  Mortal Excellence  is e∣ver subject to and the undoubted Truth of  Seneca  's asserted Max∣im  Sen Tra Troas  Quicquid Sol Oriens quicquid Occidens  Novit Coeruleis Oceanus fretis  Quicquid vel veniens vel fugiens lavat  Aetas Pegaseo corripiet gradu  What e'er the  Rising  or the  Setting Sun  Knows in the  daily  Course his  Glories  run  What e'er the  Ocean  with  SkyColour'd Waves  Or in her  Ebbings  or her  Flowings laves    Time  shall with  Pegasean Flight  devour  I will not in describing the Condition of the Cities of the  Holy Land  observe the nicety of  Geographic Regularity  but taking  first  the  SeaPort  Towns in order as they lie to the  SouthEast  of  Egypt  thence come back  the other way  and so include a full description of as much as  now  remains worth  Notice  in that Tract of Land extending as of Old from  Dan  even to  Beersheba  The SeaPort Towns of  Pa∣lestine  THE most remarkable of  such  as were of Old or still continue  SeaPort  Towns or near the Sea are these which follow  Gaza  which I else∣where mention'd  Ascalon  and  Joppa Acre Tyrus  and the Celebrated  Sidon  The Inland Cities  THE Inland Cities anciently of most  Repute  and now remaining most deserving of a Stranger's Observation are no more than these which

Reader  now  to a Description of a River worth  Remark  in that it is the  only noted one  the  Holy Land  can boast of and a  Memo∣rable Monument  of the  Almighty Vengeance  on a Wicked People in the  Stagnate Sea  of heavy Waters which  at present  covers those  oncelovely  Plains on whose delightful Surface stood the Cities which by Obstinate Adherence to the Blackest Vices drew down Show'rs of  Fire  and  Brim∣stone  on their  Ʋnrepenting  and  Supine Inhabitants  The Etymolo∣gy of  Dan  DAN  of Old the  Southern Boundary  of  Palestine  receiv'd its  Name  from a large  Fountain  near to which the Town was Situated And from a kind of  Lake  or  Well  of mighty  Depth  and  Magnitude  some Miles above that Ancient City  Flows  the celebrated River  Jordan  running thence thro  Sub∣terraneous  Passages to the aforenam'd  Fountain Dan  emitting  there  and at  another Fountain  somewhat  smaller  very  near  and  Anciently  distinguish'd by the  Name  of  Jor    The Etymolo∣gy of  Jordan  those rising Streams which gradually swell to a considerable Breadth and Form by their continued Course the River  Jordan  Description of the River  NEITHER the  Length  the  Breadth  or  Depth  of  Jordan  are Extra∣ordinary where  Broadest  not exceeding half a Quarter of an  English Mile  and no ways Navigable for a  Bark  of  Burthen Slow  in motion  Smooth  and  Clear  in all her  Channels  and from  North  to  South  dividing many Plea∣sant Tracts of Land for more than half the Length of  Palestine  Its Course and Beauty  THERE is not in the Universe a River of a more Delightful  Prospect  or agreeable  Contrivance  as to the  Meandring Forms  and  Winding Laby∣rinths  wherein it glides with an  Ʋncommon  Gentleness along the midst of  Plains  and  Vallies  sometimes thro' an open Country then Inclos'd  on either side  by rising  Ridges  of fine Woody Hills and  every where  adorn'd on both its  Banks  with Shady Groves of  Poplar AlderTrees  the  Mournful Wil∣low  and a Thousand other Lovely  Greens  surprizingly Inchanting every Eye with  sudden Wonder  at the Unassisted  Gayeties  of  Virgin Nature  YET does the River sometimes change its proper Form and Wander till tis lost  a while  in certain  Lakes  amongst whose Number  two  there are which  Anciently  were Famous for their  Magnitude  and  Depth  and  still  continue highly worth a  Strangers Observation  The Lake  Hoo∣lee  THE First is Situated in the  Ʋpper Galilee  and  now  call'd  Hoolee  Spa∣cious in the  Winter  but in  Summer  almost Dry and yeilding a Production of  such Quantities  of  Reeds  that commonly  Wild Beasts  find Shelter  there  and Dangerously lie in  Ambush  for the  Ʋnsuspecting  Traveller  The Sea of  Galilee  THE other formerly the  Lake  of  Tiberias  or  Genezareth  and some∣times call'd in  HolyWrit  the  Sea  of  Galilee  is Fifteen Miles in  Length  and Ten in  Breadth  affording  Numerous Kinds  of  Fish  of admirable Relish and so Strangely Fatning all the  Soil  which Borders on it that it well deserves the  Name  of the most Fertil Part of all the  Holy Land  Jordan  how Swallow'd up  THUS Glides the River  Jordan  with a natural Face of Pleasure till 'tis Swallow'd up in the  Dead Sea  to which it enters with a full discharge of all its  Waters  but is seen no more  from that time forward  nor the  Sea itself  observ'd to swell by such a  Tributary Affluence  of  Encreasing Waters  whence 'tis reasonably guess'd that there must be some  Subterraneous Channels  to disgorge the Streams receiv'd so Plentifully  Etymology of the  Dead Sea  THIS Lake is call'd the  Dead Sea  from the  Heavy Stagnate  Nature of the Water it contains which neither Currents nor the Force of  Tem∣pests  have the Power to stir from its amazing stillness and it is observable that tho' the River  Jordan  runs into it it continues a considerable space entirely  Clear  and long unmixing with those  Thicker Waters  Its Extent and Original  THIS  Sea  or  Lake  is Sixteen Miles in  Breadth  and Seventy  Long now  Drowning all that  Paradise  of  Pleasure  that  Delightful Plain once  call'd  Pentapolis  amongst whose Five Aspiring Cities  Sodom  and  Gomorrah  were the two most Wealthy ever since their Fatal Burning by the  Fire  and  Brimstone  of  Vindictive Heaven  entirely sunk beneath the Surface of this dismal  Lake  which now o'erflows the Ancient Habitations of  Luxurious Wickedness  and does at certain seasons of the Year especially preceeding  Rainy Weather  constantly emitt a kind of  Mist  or  Smoaky Cloud  in Five di∣stinct and distant Places which the Superstitious People  thereabouts  wou'd needs perswade us to believe  point out  the several  Situations  of those Mi∣serable  Cities  Its Nature and Descrip∣tion  THE  Salt  or  Brackishness  peculiar to the Waters of this  Lake  is so ex∣treamly great that Heavy  Bodies  thrown upon the Surface sink not down without much difficulty and it is reported that the  Roman Emperor Vespa∣sian  Commanded certain Sentenc'd  Malefactors  to be Bound and thrown in  Headlong  for a Proof of the Experiment which was confirm'd by their strange  Floating up and down  incapable of sinking thro' the Surface of the Waters whose  Sulphureous Quality  prevail'd so far upon their  Skin  that it  Peel'd off  in every Part as if they had been  Scalded  and this last effect it  now  produces to so Piercing a degree that it will  Flea  the  Fingers  of a  Man  who Rashly goes about to  Wash his Hands  in that Untempting Monu∣ment of Horror and Iniquity  Why call'd  Asphaltites  IT likewise bears the Name  Asphaltites  from a Prodigious quantity of  Pitchy  or  Bituminous substance  call'd  Asphaltum  which is Bred  in time  upon the Surface of the  Lake  and being cast  on shore  all round it  gather'd  by the Country People and  employ'd  in many uses often Anciently exported into  Egypt  for  Embalming  the  Dead Bodies  of the Vulgar not capacitated to afford the Purchase of an  Aromatic Composition  Why the  Lake  of  Sodom  and  Gomorrah  AMONG the many Names it is distinguish'd by 'twas justly call'd  the Lake of Sodom and Gomorrah  in Commemoration of the Dreadfull Punish∣ment inflicted by the  Hand of our Almighty God  upon a Sinfull People  once  Inhabiting the Cities which had  there  their Situation  A Vulgar Er∣ror concern∣ing the  Dead Sea  IT has been commonly reported and confirm'd by the Assertion of some  Modern Travellers  that all such  Birds  as dare attempt the  Flying  o∣ver it are suffocated with the Vapours rising from the  Lake  and fall down  dead upon its  Surface  This I can assure my Reader is a most  egregious Falsehood  for I have not only seen vast quantities of  Fowl  fly  up and down  about it but descend  sometimes  in search of Meat upon such  floating Reeds  or other  swimming Heaps  as lie upon the top thereof Perhaps the Story took its Rise from the Repute which  Poets  gave  Avernus  and some other  Lakes  on that Account Thus touch'd on by  Lucretius  Luci  Lib  Nomen id ab re  Impositum est quia sunt avibus contraria cunctis  E regione ea quod loca cum advenêre volantes  Remigii oblitae pennarum vela remittunt  Praecipitesq cadunt molli cervice profusâ  That  Name  is justly giv'n  Because the  Killing Nature  of the  Place  Is  still Destructive  to the  Feather'd Race    Who when they leave their  Tracts  of  milder Air  And  hither  with  advent'rous Flight  repair  Forgetting  how to  Fly  they strangely  fail  Thro' the  Infected Air  on  Wings  to  sail  And with  extended Necks  fall  headlong  down  One good Quality of the  Dead Sea  I shall only add one Observation  more  before I end this  Chapter  and that is  this Lake  among its many  Ill  has one  Good  Quality For by the  Bri∣ny  Nature of its  Waters  and the  Soil  about it it yields such mighty Quan∣tities of  Salt  as furnish all the  Holy Land  with unexhausted Plenty of that  necessary Product  Lot  's Wife and the Pillar of Salt  YET one Addition  more accosting  my Remembrance must implore the Reader's Pardon if I stay to mention it It is that 'mongst a Ridge of  Mountains  not far distant from the  Lake  I have been treating of they show a Hill of an indifferent  Magnitude  which is or seems to be a kind of Rocky  Salt  unfit for  Ʋse  and  thence  unvalued upon any  other reason  than the Re∣putation of being what the  Scriptures  call  the Pillar of Salt  into which  Lot's Wife  was Metamorphos'd when her  Female Curiosity  inclin'd her to  look back  against the  Angel's Order  and behold the Ruins of her  Flaming City  CHAP XLIII Of the Present State of the  Christian Religion  in  Palestine  A shocking Contemplati∣on  TWOU'D be perhaps impossible in Travelling about the spacious  Ʋniverse  to find a  Scene  more strangely shocking to a  Christian Zeal  than what the  Holy Land  affords at  present  For it cannot surely be a welcome  Contemplation  to a Man who owns the  Faith  of  Christ  to see that Place have  least  of his  Religion  which had  most  of his  Good Wishes  THE vilest  Soil  the  Earth  possesses yields  Encrease  when it is Sow'd with  Liberality  But this  ungrateful Clime  this  miserable Country  enrich'd by the  inestimable Blood  of  Christ himself  is yet so far from an Improvement of her not alone  Prodigious  but  Peculiar Blessings  that the disencourag'd  Practice  of  Repuls'd Christianity  is disregarded more in  Palestine  than even the most  Remote  and  Barbarous Corners  of the  Turkish  Territories  The common  Christian  Inha∣bitants of  Pa∣lestine  THE scatter'd  Christians  who Inhabit with the  Turks  in any of those Towns I mention'd in the  former Chapter  commonly are such as are at∣tracted by the  Summons  of a Profitable Way of  Living  and forgetting every  Call  of their  Humanity  but that of  Interest  give their Minds  entirely up  to a continued Practice of such  advantageous Courses  as engaging totally the  Bent  of their  Desires  prevent their  Souls  from the neglected  Execution  of those  Holy Duties  which wou'd better  far  become their Applicati∣on  Many Sects who live in the Temple of  Christ  's Sepul∣chre  HOWEVER there are many different  Sects  of  Christians  here who led by Piety and the prevailing Love of their  Religion  and its Practices a∣bandon all the gayest Follies of the gilded World and spend their Days within  Jerusalem  nay commonly within the very  Temple  of our  Saviour's Sepulchre  with all the Marks of a sincere Repentance and ingenious Re∣signation to the Smarts of  Poverty  and unalluring Rules of an un∣seign'd  Austerity  How Con∣verse with Strangers  SOME Hundreds of these zealous Families perpetually reside with∣in the Temple so as never to Eat Drink or Sleep in any other Place nor find a possibility of Conversation with the People of the Town at any other time than when they bring  Provisions  thither and by ringing  one  of a great number of  small Bells  by different Cords made fast within the seve∣ral Apartments of the  Christians  there give notice to the Persons they de∣sire to speak with who immediately come out to be acquainted with the reason of their  Summons  BUT since it may not be an unacceptable Amusement for the Reader to be made acquainted with the  different Tenets  of the  different Sects  residing at  Jerusalem  I will enumerate the several  Doctrines  of such  Christian Zealots  as are comprehended in the following  Denominations  The Names of  Christian  Sects residing in  Jerusalem  ARMENIANS Coptees Abyssens  and  Graecians Jacobins Nestorians Georgians  and a kind of People who have many Monasteries on  Mount Lebanon  and are distinguish'd  amongst Christians  by the Name of  Ma∣ronites  The  Armeni∣ans  THE  Faith  of the  Armenians  who are next the  Graecians  here most numerous has been already told you in the  three and twentieth Chapter  largely treating of those Peoples Customs and their  Tenets  of Reli∣gion  The  Coptees  and  Graecians  I likewise have inform'd you that the  Coptees  are the Remnant of the  Old Egyptians  and at large describ'd their  Doctrine  and  Condition  in the  four and twentieth Chapter of this Treatise  nor can I enlarge without a flat  Pro∣lixity  on what I have already said concerning  Greece  and the  Religion  of her  Natives  The Tolerati∣on given them  LET it then suffice to say that all the three abovenam'd  Sects  admini∣ster in the respective Offices of their Religion at  Jerusalem  with as un∣bounded a  Permission  and the same degrees of  Ceremony  as they are allow'd to use when in their several distant Countries  THE rest I will proceed to treat of as distinctly as I can and first the  Abyssens  more ancient than their  Fellows  in  Conversion  to the  Faith  and  Wor∣ship  of our  Saviour Christ  require the Preference  The  Abyssens  THEY are no other than the  Aethiopian Race  whose  Ancestors  em∣brac'd the  Christian Doctrine  from the Preaching of their Queen  Candace  's  Eunuch Philip's Convert  much about the  Year of Christ  Four Hundred and Seventy  The Tenets of their Religi∣on  THEY  Circumcise  their Children Authoriz'd as they imagine by our  Saviour's own Example  and extend the Duty of that  manual Operation  to both  Sexes  equally  THE  Man  at forty Days Old and the  Woman  at threescore they con∣stantly  Baptize  repeating every Year that  Sacramental Ceremony  on the  Twelfth Day of Christmas  in Commemoration only of the Condescention of our  Lord  who stoop'd that Day to be  Baptiz'd  in  Jordan  by St  John the Baptist  CONFESSION Keeping  Lent  and Praying for the  Dead  are Points wherein they join exactly with the  Roman Catholicks  as they oppose them rigidly in not admitting  Images  in  Churches  or the  Ʋse  of  Crucifixes  and permitting  Priests  to  Marry freely  A  Jewish  Incli∣nation  IN one odd  Point  they seem to favour the  Opinion  of the  Jews  with whom they side in  Abstinence  from certain  Meats  and keeping  Saturday  as  Holy  as they do the  Christian Sahaoth  I need not tell the  Learned Reader  that the  Jacobins  are call'd so from the  Founder  of their  Heresy  a  Syrian  of mean Parentage and Fortune nam'd  Jacobus  The Religion of the  Jaco∣bius  HIS Dictates taught his Followers and their Posterity to make the  Godhead  of our  Saviour  Passive and Subservient to his  Manhood  They be∣lieve the  Soul of Man Immortal  but with this  Reserve  that it continues  Slumb'ring  with tho  Body  till the  Day of Judgment  CONFESSION Purgatory and the Prayers of  Roman Catholicks  for the Deceas'd they disregard as needless Innovations Their  Priests  may  Marry  and Administer the  Sacrament  in both kinds and unanimously join to disbelieve the Truth and disobey the Orders of the  ancient Fathers  and their  Synods  for the most part  The  Nestorians  NESTORIƲS  in the Reign of  Theodosius  was Bishop of  Constantino∣ple  and a Native of the  Ʋpper Germany  he introduc'd an  Heresy  which has prevail'd extreamly in the  East  and gives the Denomination of  Nestorians  to its Professors  IN the Administration of the  Eucharist  this  Sect  deny the  Real Presence  nor permit the  Virgin Mary  to be call'd  The Mother of God  They read the  Scriptures  and pretend to practise a reserv'd  Humility  but make a strange  Division  in our  Saviour Christ  between his  Divine  and  Humane  Na∣ture  The  Georgians  THE  Georgians  call'd so from the  Country  of that Name in ancient Days  Albania  or  Iberia  are in many Ceremonies and Opinions Imitators of the  Greeks  and most distinguish'd by the following  Principles  to which they long have been most strict  Adherers  THEY take a Liberty from their  Religion  to indulge their Senses al∣most to the highest Pitch of  Incest  by permitting  Marriages  within the  Rules  of  Christian Prohibition  They are great Admirers of  loud Instruments  of  Musick  in their Churches and have seldom deviated from an  honesty of Mind  which speaks 'em justly Qualified for the Respect and Care of  Euro∣paean Governments  who might with little Charge or Labour bring them o∣ver from their  inoffensive Ignorance  to a more lively and illuminated  Know∣ledge  of the  Christ  they Worship  The  Maronites  THE  Maronites  took Name from  Maro  an  Old Abbot  who won 'em o∣ver from the  Jacobin Opinion  to a  new one  of  his own  or as some say from a large  Village  call'd  Marona  situated near their famous  Monastery  on Mount  Lebanus  or  Lebanon  THERE have been frequent Conferences set on Foot between the  Roman Catholicks  and the abovenam'd  Maronites  wherein the  former  have so well succeeded that they are come wholly over to the  Church of Rome  some few  Reserves  excepted  two  of which are these They hold it as a Su∣perstitious  Ceremony  to make use of  Extreme Ʋnction one  of the  Seven Ro∣mish Sacraments  and look upon all  Prayers  for the Deceas'd as helpless Of∣fices of a mistaken  Zeal  or ineffectual  Bigottry  The Govern∣ment these Sects are sub∣ject to  THESE then are all the noted  Christians  now Inhabiting  Jerusalem  or any other Part of  Palestine  each several  Order  subject to the Govern∣ment of their respective  Bishop Abbot  or  Elected Guardian  but so much more subject to the  Turkish Power  that they must miserably stand de∣press'd by want of  Riches  or  Authority  and see the  Ground  which once the  Good  the  Holy Jesus  honour'd with his  Habitation  made the Property and ruin'd by the Insolence of those audacious  Infidels  who dare upon the very Scene of his prodigious  Agonies  Blaspheme his  Person  and Deride his  Crucifixion  The Conclu∣sion of the Chapter  IN this Condition  Reader  lies the  HolyLand  at  present  scarce e∣nough esteem'd by the few  Turks  who live therein to make 'em guess their  Profits  worth their  Pains  and yet in vain desir'd with longing Wishes by many  Christian Princes  who for want of a suffi∣cient Power by single Efforts to expel the Conquerors are forc'd to see that  Land  more wretched  now  than any other which was  once  declar'd by  God himself  the Happiest of the  Ʋniverse  CHAP XLIV Of  Arabia  the  Stony  Arabia  not all subject to the  Turk  NOW let us look a little into the Dominions of the  Three Arabia  's many Parts whereof are subject to the  Turkish Sultan  but far more  are not  yet do those Lawless and Imperious Monarchs claim the Honour of the  Government of all  by adding to their  Titles  an  Illegal Claim  to the  entire Possession  of the  wide Arabia  SINCE therefore  tho' not really his  he calls them  so  I will as briefly as is possible to satisfie the Reader give a just Description of the  Three Divisions  of this  Mighty Country  and first attempt a thorough View of that  Arabia  call'd  Petraea  Arabia Petraea  why so call'd  ARABIA PETRAEA  or  Arabia the Stony  either took its Name from  Petra  now call'd  Ratalallah  by the  Turks  its Masters the  Metro∣polis  of Old of all the Country or as some will have it from the  Rocky Mountains  which confine it and the great  Stone Quarries  at the bottom of the Sand in every Part within it  The Situation of the Stony  Arabia  'TIS bounded on the  Northern side  by  Syria  on the  West  by  Egypt  on the  East  it borders on the  Desarts of Arabia  and the  Southern  Confines touch the  Northern  Shores of the  Red Sea  and the delightful Frontiers of  Arabia Felix  Description of the Soil  THE Land is very  desolate  and  barren  to a vast degree The Ground lies wast o'erwhelm'd a thousand times a Year by fluctuating Waves of rolling Sand if I may call them so impetuously driven up and down Hills chang'd to Valleys and the Valleys suddenly transform'd to Mountains nothing here can boast the certainty of one Half Hours Duration all the Face of  Fickle Nature  varies in a moment and you see no more the vanish'd Prospect you have just been looking on  Its Barrenness  NO  Tree  here flourishes but now and then a solitary Palm the Ground unstable can produce no more than two or three low kind of Herbs the  Hyssop  and another with a spreading  Leaf  which wanting little depth for Root grow here and there upon the Grassless Surface of the Naked  Sand  Great Want of Water  BUT what is more than all the rest intolerable is the melancholy  want of Water  Travellers are subject to who often are oblig'd to ride till almost Dead with  Thirst  before they find a  Spring  sufficient to emit a  Pint of Water  for the Service of a Multitude  The Misery of the Inhabi∣tants  EXCEPTING the  Wild Arabs  whom I shall distinctly treat of by and by those miserable Wretches who Inhabit this untempting Country commonly are such as being driven from their Native Places by a barba∣rous Oppression chuse to change a forc'd for a no less but voluntary  Misery  Reflections on the ill Effects of Poverty  O pinching Poverty That Men shou'd yield their  noblest Virtues  to be crush'd by thee How strange are thy Effects And to what  unaccountable Attempts  dost thou push on the Minds of such as feel thee No Men had certainly ran headlong to these  Desarts  to avoid the  Shame  thy Power ex∣pos'd 'em to unless thou art indeed as terrible as the  Old Poet  thus has re∣presented thee  Theognis  upon Poverty  Poverty Cyrnus  ames a  Good Man  more  Than  Fevers Age  and all he felt before  To  fly  the heavy Curse of  being Poor  What  Ills  O  Cyrnus  shou'd not Men endure  They rather ought to meet some  Briny Wave  And 'midst  th'unfathom'd Ocean  find a  Grave    'Twere better far to  rush  against some  Rock  And  dash their Brains out  with the bloody Shock  For ev'ry Man by  Poverty  's deprest  Nor can he  Speak  or  Act  or  Live at Rest    But  Tonguetyed Silence  binds his  knowing Breast  Thence  Cyrnus  shou'd we strive by  Land  or  Sea  From  Poor Mens Burthens  to live ever  free  For 'tis far better we shou'd  Death  endure  Than bear the  Weight of Life  if  Life  must still be  Poor  Reflections on the vanity of Pride  YET is it  on the other Hand  as wretched a Condition to be  swell'd  beyond the  Knowledge  of our Selves and the  Remembrance  of our Frailties by the transitory Preference we gain above our  Fellow Mortals  by the short∣liv'd  Honours Wealth  bestows on our deluded  Wishes  sudden Changes and undreamtof Storms invading our Possessions may reduce us swiftly even below a Level with the  meanest  of our  Menials  and to punish our  Ambition  Shipwreck our  GoodFortune  A Story of a Proud Rich Man at  Ham∣burgh  I very well remember once at  Hamburgh  to have seen a melancholy Instance of the strange  Vicissitudes  to which  Mortality  is hourly Subject For as I was looking on the  Monuments  which grac'd a  Church  of the above∣nam'd  City  I took notice of a certain  TombStone  fix'd up sideways to the  Wall  on which besides a deal of  Sculpture  there were deeply cut the strange Particulars of the  Relation  following in the  German  Lan∣guage  FREDERIC LEOPOLD LAƲSSERBƲRG  a Person of obscure Birth and an Illiterate Education grew so Rich by Great Mens Favour and a thousand unexpected Blessings of an undeserv'd GoodFor∣tune that he was advanc'd to the most envied  Dignities  the  Magistracy  of the City cou'd bestow upon him and encreas'd in  Wealth  and  Power  to so prodigious a degree that no six  Gentlemen  in all that Country cou'd out∣balance his  Possessions  A weakness of Nature  PRIDE the Consequence and Common Tinger of  Triumphant Beg∣gary  quite turn'd his Senses In this Height of  Exaltation  he forgot the means by which he  rose  and look'd upon the Blessings he Possess'd as Fram'd for his Enjoyment Insolence and Vanity so Clouded his small share of understanding that he us'd all People with such  Ʋnbred Haughti∣ness  that he became the Universal hate of  Town  and  Country  Good advice unhappily Slighted  PROVIDENCE endeavour'd to oblige him by a Warning from the Mouth of a Free Speaker his Relation who attempting to disswade him from the Odious Practice of so Scornfull a Deportment urging that tho'  now  he was above the Malice of the World a time might come when he shou'd cease to be so had this vain and senseless answer thrown upon him  Alas Poor Fool an Ass might sooner learn to Play upon the Bag∣pipes than the Curse of Poverty be Taught a Way to make me Miserable  A Midnight alarm  ADVICE was ineffectual and the Gentleman forbore repeating it the Haughty  Lausserburg  went soon that Night to  Bed  and  Wak'd  about the  Hour  of  Midnight  with a wonderfull Surprize to hear the Noise of  Rustic Musick  in the  Street  and as he thought before his  Windows  with a Hundred Exclamations such as  Lord deliver us Protect us Heaven  and the like from all the Windows opposite to his whose Casements shutt and open'd with a strange Confusion  A wonderfull Apparition  TEMPTED by the Noises he got out of Bed and Running to his Chamber Window threw it open and the first Remark he cast his Eyes on was a kind of  Phantom  representing the exact resemblance of an  Ass  erected on his hinder Legs and Dancing up and down to an uncommon Tune of his own Playing on a perfect  Bagpipe  while the Frighted Neighbours all amaz'd  before  were  now  far more surpriz'd to see the  Apparition Vanish  in the very Moment he look'd out at Window and be∣held it  THE Startled  Lausserburg  in Agonies at this Appearance presently Reflected on the Wicked answer he had made his Friend and from that Hour became so Melancholy that he never relish'd former Pleasures but neglected strangely all his Great Concerns and sunk almost to a down∣right Stupidity  A sudden Downfall  AMAZING Accidents by Fire and Robbers Lawsuits and Neg∣lect in two Years time consum'd his Wealth to so incredible a Change that being hated by the Townsmen they refus'd to give him the relief he wanted so that he who lately Judg'd himself too Great to know an Equal or Converse with an Inferior was by Providence reduc'd to Beg his Bread from Door to Door and hope a Charity from even the meanest of those People whom he had before Uncharitably dealt with  A Miserable Condition  nay so far  IllFortune  Tortur'd him that not admitted under any Roof  That very Friend  who had forewarn'd him of the possibility of Falling com∣ing late one  Moonlight Night  along the Street in very Cold and Rainy Weather saw him sitting huddled on a Heap of Dirt half Naked Shel∣tred from the Rain by nothing but a kind of  Wicker'd Basket  which being close at Bottom but as open as a  Cage  in every other part he had drawn over him to keep his Head from the Severity of Wea∣ther  The use of the Story  THIS Story carv'd at large upon the  Tombstone  quickens Pity and Amazement at one time and may be usefull as a  Mirror  to present the World with an exact Idea of the rise and fall of  Vanity  and the Misfortunes drawn by  Pride  upon the  Bubbles of Mortality  Shells and Shining Sand upon the De∣sart  BEFORE I close this Chapter 'twill be proper to inform the Reader that the Sandy Desarts of the  Stony  and indeed the other two  Arabia's  are cover'd thickly with a Thousand kinds of  Little Shells  and  Nitrous Atoms  which appear with Glistering Beauty at a distance from you which with several other Proofs are reasonable Grounds for a belief that  once  these Plains  now Desart Sands  were a large Part of the  Main Ocean  CHAP XLV Of  Arabia  the  Desart  The Desarts of  Arabia  THE mighty  Desarts  of the  Wast Arabia South  of the  Foregoing  are confin'd that way by the  Arabia  well call'd  Happy  from the A∣romatic Blessings of its Climate But on every other side run wildly on towards  Babylon  and  Media Mesopotomia  and  Armenia  in such endless Tracts of  Sand  and  Desolation  that the undiscover'd Reach of their prodigious  Surface  frightens Curiosity from Thoughts of searching for the just Extent of such a dangerous Territory  Different from the rest of the World  HEAVEN has here laid Wast the Work of  Earth's Creation  or con∣triv'd these  Blots  of  Nature  like a  Mole  in a  fine Face  to serve as  Foils  and add an Ornamental  Lustre  to the Brighter Parts of the more  Temperate Ʋni∣verse  THE  Elements  themselves are here at War The  Sun  inflames the  Sand  and the Tempestuous  Sand  invades the  Air  with Waves of Fire whose rolling Heaps like stormy Billows of impetuous  Heat  hiss dreadfully against the Breath of those prodigious Tempests which remove them hour∣ly and make a  Chaos  of the horrid  Desart  Wild Beasts and Serpents in the Desarts  NOT a  Shrub  grows here or any thing at all which looks like  Na∣ture  in her common Decency the  Hiss  of every kind of Poys'nous  Serpent  aggravates the Terrour of a trembling Traveller who all inviron'd by the dangerous  Snakes  and salvage  Beasts  which scaring others are them∣selves as often scar'd by the unstable Motion of the trackless  Desarts  is ob∣lig'd to seem at  Sea  upon the scorching  Continent  and Travel  Day and Night  without the smallest  Guide  but the Assistance of a  Com∣pass  The Virtue of Fire in the Desarts  THE raging  Heat  of a perpetual  Sun  so burns the  Sands  they Travel on that they are scorch'd as if they walk'd thro' halfextinguish'd heaps of  Ashes  yet are they still oblig'd to carry  Fire  and fix it round the Places where they rest to fright away the Monst'rous Creatures who wou'd else assault 'em  The Skill of the  Arabians  THOSE  Arabians  who are Knowing in the Nature of the horrid  Cli∣mate  guess by certain Motions of the Clouds the coming of a Storm of  Wind  from any Quarter and the distance it is at and consequently suit their Travels thro' the  Desarts  to their Best Conveniency  The Misery of Christians Travelling without a Guide in the Desarts of  Arabia  BUT  Christian Strangers  wholly Ignorant of all those  Signs  nor daring to confide so far in the suspected  Arabs  as to take 'em for their  Guides  are sometimes miserably overtaken by the danger of a  Storm  which agitates the Ground they travel on with all the violence of the severest  Earthquake  lifting Men and Camels from the  Desart  or at least so fills the  Air  with  Clouds of Sand driv'n up and down by unresisted  Whirlwinds  that the Wretched  Traveller  quite blinded with their Fury stands  unknowing what to do  while the  Dried Dead Bodies  of Men and Women who have perish'd  Ages since  in passing over are with a surprizing Horror blown upon them whisk'd like Paper thro' the Air all Dreadful and Deform'd with those suspended  Carkasses  and Flocks of  Serpents  hurried violently thro' the Winds with the uplifted  Tracks  of glowing  Sand  they lately crept in  WHO knows but many of those dead Mens  Bodies  which are blown so frightfully about the  Desart  are the same who perish'd when the  Roman Legions  under  Warlike Cato  bravely pass'd this  Sultry Climate  in the Search of Glory and on whose account the  Poet Lucan  thus describes the Nature of these  Desarts  Luc  L  Sic Orbem torquente Noto Romana juventus  Procubuit metuens{que} rapi constrinxit amictus  Inseruit{que} manus terrae nec pondere solo  Sed nixu jacuit vix sic immobilis Austro  Qui super ingentes cumulos involuit arenae  At{que} operit tellure viros vix tollere miles  Membra valet multo congestu pulveris haerens  Alligat stantes affusae magnus arenae  Agger immoti terrâ surgente tenentur  Saxa tulit penitus discussis proruta muris  Effudit{que} procul mirandâ sorte malorum  Qui nullas vidêre domos vidêre ruinas  Jam{que} iter omne latet nec sunt discrimina terrae  Ʋlla nisi aetheriae medio velut aequore flammae  Sideribus novêre vias  While thus disturbing Earth the  South Wind  blew  The  Romans  on the Ground their  Bodies  threw  And fearing swiftly to be  blown away  Bound fast their  Cloaths  and graspt the  Soil  whereon they lay  Nor does their  Weight  alone secure them there  A Clinging Strength they make the  Surface  bear  Scarce can they  thus  the  Southern  Storm withstand  Which o'er their Prostrate Heads rolls mighty Hills of  Sand    Buried therein  the Soldiers scarce can lift  Their  Limbs  the  Monumental  Dust to shift  Those who dare  stand upright unmov'd  remain  Kept  strait  by heaps of Sand which  overwhelm  the Plain  Prodigious Stones rent from some  broken Wall  Fly in the  Tempest  which supports them all  And in some  distant Clime  with wonder lets them  fall  They  Ruins  see who can no  Houses  spy  No beaten  Path  salutes the longing  Eye  No different  Roads  in this  sad Place  appear  Like  Mariners  by  Stars  their doubtful  Course  they Steer  The wretched Condition of Travellers who are lost in the De∣serts  HORROR and Confusion overtake the  Traveller  who by a thousand little  Accidents  is hourly liable to lose his  Company  Imagine Reader what a miserable State you wou'd believe your self reduc'd to were you left a∣lone amidst the wild and unfrequented  Sands  of these unmeasur'd  Desarts Nothing  near you nor within the reach of the most Sanguine Hope but dreadful  Serpents  unknown  Monsters  and a thousand barbarous Enemies to  Nature  and  Humanity  No distant Prospect of a Smoaking  Chimney  to di∣rect  your Footsteps nor the comfortable sight of Beaten  Roads  to guide you in your  Journey Day  assaulting you with scorching  Heats  Ghosts and Apparitions in the Desarts  and  Night  con∣founding you with the repeated Shreicks and shrill Complaints of  Ghosts  or  Apparitions  which it you believe the People of the Country wander Night∣ly up and down about these  Desarts  Mischievous Hobgoblins  THE  Arabs  told me fifty frightful Stories of the  Mischiefs  done by these  Hobgoblins  who delight  it seems  to exercise  Deceit  and make poor Travellers not only lose their way but perish in the  Desart  HOWEVER there was some Years since a Certain  Better natur'd Spirit  than a Man has commonly an Opportunity to get  acquainted with  and since 'tis pity she shou'd lose the  Honour  due to her  Civility  I will Re∣cord her for as honest and obliging an  Hobgoblin  as ever can be found in all  Arabia  A Story of an  Armenian Mer∣chant  lost in the Desarts of  Arabia  THERE was as I was told by my Judicious  Turkish Author  an  Ar∣menian Merchant  call'd  Demetrio  who liv'd for many Years in  Egypt  and as I remember in the City of  Grand Cairo  till by his industrious Applica∣tion to the  Art  he Practis'd he became considerably Rich and Flourish'd mightily  IT seems the Man was of a Grateful  Temper  and remember'd that when he had liv'd while  Young  in  Babylon  in a Condition very  Mean  and much depress'd by  Servitude  and  Poverty  he had receiv'd extraordinary  Civilities  from a  Good natur'd Turk  by whose Assistance only he had been enabled to engage himself in that successful way of  Living  which had  now  so happily improv'd his Former  Circumstances  The grateful Design of a dangerous Journey  HE made a Resolution that he wou'd go pay a  Visit  to his  Friend  in  Ba∣bylon  and let him see that he remember'd gratefully the many  Bounties  he had formerly receiv'd and wou'd  reward  at least  acknowledge  his exten∣sive  Obligations  and accordingly he went in Company with the Great  Caravan  which cross'd the  Desarts  to the very  Place  he had design'd a  Journey to  The Water falls short  HE Travell'd pleasantly enough till he was got almost half thro' the danger of his  Passage  when it hapned that the  Caravan  fell short of  Water  which they search'd in vain for among the Sands so that their  Thirst  encrea∣sing daily almost all their  Beasts  of  Burthen  fainted under it and many of their Company unable to support the  Anguish  it reduc'd them to fell Sick and Died in  Miserable Torment  They detach Parties to seek a Spring  PRODIGIOUS Offers there were doubtless made for the reward of any who shou'd  then  discover the glad Tydings of a  Spring  which tho' they cou'd not reasonably hope to find the  Zeal  of their  Desires  and  Sharp∣ness  of their  Appetite  inclin'd them to endeavour it by sending out De∣tachments every way with  Orders  not to lose the Sight of one ano∣ther  They divide and straggle from each other  THE  Wants of Nature  notwithstanding this Precaution urg'd their Courages to a contempt of any other  Danger  than the  Death  they drea∣ded from the  Want of Water  wherefore little minding the Advice they had receiv'd they frequently divided their small  Parties  and wou'd ramble singly  up and down  regarding nothing but the Thoughts of keeping still within the hearing of each others  Hollow  A dangerous Wandering  AMONG the rest one  MoonlightNight Demetrio  it seems was gone a Water Hunting and had straggled to considerable  distance  from the  Party  he went out with but  imagin'd  he discover'd all about him many Companies belonging to the  Caravan  employ'd on the same  Errand  he was busy in at last he heard a Voice  on his left Hand  which call'd as from the  Nearest Party  with the welcome Repetition of these Words  Ho This way this way we have found out Water  A delusive Prospect  FULL of Joy he look'd about him and perceiv'd at least imagin'd he perceiv'd the  Parties  of the  Caravan  run all one way as if they follow'd the Transporting  Summons  which invited them to  Crowd that way  and tast the  Water  he believ'd so happily discover'd  IN short he ran as fast as he was able close upon the Heels of  Certain Men  whose  Faces  he was very well acquainted with and knew them to be∣long to the  Great Caravan  he came with  The malice of a Company of Ghosts  Till  at last  when he had follow'd them above an Hour they turn'd upon him  shook their Heads laugh'd loud  then  disappear'd  and  vanish'd  like a  Shadow  NATURES Dictates may inform the Reader what  Convulsive Ago∣nies  alarm'd the Breast of the  Deceiv'd Armenian  when he saw those  Guides  dissolve to  Air  on whom he had depended as his  Safeguards  and  Directors  But his  Fright  encreas'd to double horror when he look'd all round him and cou'd see no Sign of  Man  or  Beast  but found he had been led away from all his Company by the delusive Beckons of Malicious  Ghosts  and Illde∣signing  Apparitions  A sad Condi∣tion  IN vain he curs'd the hapless  Motives  which inclin'd him to the Jour∣ney and with bitter Cries bewail'd his  Misery  lamenting the Misfortune of his lost  Condition  with a flood of Tears which bath'd the  Sands  o'er which he wand'red void of Comfort and instead of finding the far distant  Company  he look'd for hourly rambled farther in the  Desart  while his A king  Eyes  saw nothing in his way but trackless Regions of unstable  Sand  and both his  Ears  were deeply pierc'd by frightful Hissings of the  Serpents  round him and the doleful Shrieks and horrid Yells of unseen  Ghosts  and Hovering  Hobgoblins  A despairing Resolution  TWO Days and Nights were thus pass'd over when despairing ever∣more of seeing  Man  and weak'ned by  Fatigue  and want of  Food  and  Water  he laid himself upon the  Sands  and was resolv'd to wait his Death with an  Heroic Resignation  to the  Will  of Providence  HE had not lain two Hours before he started at the  Repetition  of a  Voice  which call'd three times in a shrill melancholy Accent  Demetrio Demetrio Demetrio  A Wife good∣natur'd even after Death  HE lifted up his Eyes with great Amazement at the mention of his Name in such a Place as  that  and scarce believ'd himself awake when he beheld his  Wife  at two Yards distance from him with a  Pot of Water  in  one Hand  and a  Dry Bisket  in the  other  SHE plac'd 'em by him and made Signs that he shou'd  Eat  and  Drink  which an halffamish'd  Appetite  oblig'd him to endeavour after he had offer'd to Embrace  his Wife  who glided from him like an  Airy Phantom  and forbad him  touching her  The  Speech  of a  Ghost  to a  Man  in the  Desarts  I am  said she  no more the  Partner  of your Earthly Blessings Death has interpos'd his  Obstacle  betwixt our  Meeting  to Embrace as formerly Thy  Friend  at  Babylon  is also Dead and thy poor  Children Motherless  at  Cairo  want thy  Comfort  Follow me and I will lead thee to thy  Company  and show thee  Water  for thy  self  and  them  which when thou hast discover'd and receiv'd the  Great Reward  that will be given thee  go back with me  I'll lead thee safely to the Borders of the  Desart  whence thou may'st return to  Egypt  tho'  alone  in safety  A Check to Curiosity  But thou must not ask me any Questions of my present  Circumstances  too Mysterious for a  Mortal  's Comprehension  OVERJOY'D but wond'ring at the strangeness of the Accident he follow'd his Obliging  Wife  quite cross another Part of the  Wide Desart  till she brought him to a Place where she assur'd him if he  dug  he shou'd find  Wa∣ter  but injoin'd him not to grieve that she was  Dead  repeating ma∣ny times that she was happier  now  than she had been while  Li∣ving  A lucky Dis∣covery  HE cou'd from hence behold the  Caravan  a third Part of whose Num∣ber had already Perish'd by the  Drought  they were expos'd to He immedi∣atly went to them brought 'em to the  Place  and show'd 'em where to  dig  till they found  Water  in sufficient quantity to satisfie them all and fill the  Vessels  for their Use in the remaining part of their sad  Journey  A dead Wife doubles her Husband's Fortune  HIS  Wife  invisible to all but  him  attended all this while and whis∣per'd in his  Ear  the best Directions she cou'd give him A Considerable  Sum of Money  was presented him by the  Commanders  of the  Caravan  which al∣most doubled what he had before obtain'd by a successful  Industry  A happy Escape from the Desarts  He pre∣sently exchang'd the Present for such  Jewels Gold  and other Riches as wou'd lie in the least Compass and conducted by his  Wifes kind Spirit  left the Company and went in safety back to  Egypt  holding a delightful Con∣versation all the way and being told a thousand wond'rous Things by his  Aerial Guide  who having brought him to the Borders of the  Desart  left him with a Charge to give her Love to all her  Children  and advise 'em how to live  secure of Happiness  by means she had inform'd him of  HE did as she directed him and when he came to  Cairo  found his  Family  in Mourning for the Death of his  Dear Wife  who left the World according to his Computation just a  Week  before he met her in the  Desarts  How they mark the Wa∣ter Places in the Desarts  THIS  Story  Reader told me by a  Turk  who thought himself a Man of great Sincerity and of no small Judgment please to take as I re∣ceiv'd it 'twill at least divert you and may serve to give you an  Idea  of those horrid  Desarts  on which Subject I shall add no more than that such  Travellers  as find a  Spring  of  Water  tolerably fresh by digging in the  Sands  too well acquainted with the  Misery of wanting it  endeavour to pre∣serve the Memory of the  Place  by fixing up a  Pike  or sometimes  two  bound fast together to make the  Mark  more lasting by its length These have a kind of  Ensign  at the top but seldom stand a Month before whole  Moun∣tains  of the  Sand  entirely bury them at least so cover them that scarce three Foot of all the  Pike  appears above the  Surface  Such a dreadful Visage bears the  Desart Country  of the  scorch'd Arabia  CHAP XLVI Of  Arabia  the  Happy  Arabia Felix  justly so nam'd  THIS Country  Aromatically Happy  in the  Spices  She produces and distinguish'd from the other two by all the  Blessings  of Indulgent  Nature  sometimes known to be a  Partial Mother  well deserves the Name of  Felix  not alone because most  Happy  in her  Wealth  and  Products  but as she is doubly so when plac'd in Competition with the two  Arabia  's her Deform'd and Barren Neighbours  Providences Bounty to this Country  PROVIDENCE has here made full amends for the Deficiencies she caus'd in both the other and the  People  who Inhabit this delightful Country are as far superior to the rest in their  Humanity  and  Fair Deport∣ment  to the Strangers they Converse with as their  Soil  exceeds the other in its Beauties and Fertility  Arabia Felix  how Go∣vern'd  ARABIA FELIX  has a  Sultan of her own  possessing  Arbitrary Power  and Ruling in the  Inland Countries  but the  SeaPort Towns  at least most of them have been long Subservient to the  Turkish Government  as valued most by that encroaching People on account of the prodigious Profits ri∣sing to their Owners from an open  Traffick  with the  Indian Countries  and the great Advantages they reap by  Exportation  of their own rich  Manufa∣ctures  and the  Product  of their  Climate  The Cities of that Country  THEY have many Cities of considerable Magnitude the Chief whereof are  Mocha Zenan Siam Ermin Surac Demmar Almacarhan Naghelsaamar Rabataaman Tais Mousar Doffar  and the  Port  of  Aden  Their way of Building  MOST of these and many other Cities are adorn'd with very fine and stately Buildings of a lasting kind of  Stone  well polish'd and join'd close with admirable  Mortar Gardens Orchards  and large Ornamental  Suburbs  generally grace the  Towns  with Beautiful Appearances and many of them are indifferently Fortified with Walls and OutWorks  The Merchan∣dizes of  Ara∣bia  THE Merchandizes of  Arabia Felix  are the  Aromatic Gums  and  Spices  it was ever famous for  Olibanum  and  Frankincense  and  Myrrh  of many kinds  Rich Balsam Sugar Canes Large CocoNuts  and  Coffee  in abun∣dance  THEY have  Grapes  and almost every kind of  Fruit  in fullest Excel∣lency  Mutton Beef  and other  Meats  both Good and Plentiful and live in the Enjoyment of the Gayest Pleasures  Nature  unassisted by the Helps of  Art  can furnish their Delights with  Plenty of Wild Beasts bred  THE  Inland Countries  are extreamly  Woody  and afford convenient Shel∣ter for the numerous  Herds  of  Lyons Leopards Tygers Wolves  and other  Beasts of Prey  abounding greatly not alone in this but all the  Three Ara∣bia  's I have treated of  The Air very Pleasant and Health∣ful  THE  Air  is constantly salubrious and notwithstanding the warm Situ∣ation of the Country reaching from near  Thirty  to  Eleven  or  Ten Degrees  of Northern  Latitude  The  Heat  is so delightfully alloy'd by frequent  Breezes  which like wanton  Zephyrs  fan the  Air  and wast the  Scent  of odoriferous  Spices  on their gentle  Breathings  that you feast upon the richest Banquet  Nature  can prepare you as you travel on the  Road  from  Town  to  City  and the moderated  Climate  softly mixing  Vernal Mildness  with the  Beams  of  Sum∣mer  makes all  Seasons  equally engaging so that the  Greek Poet  who in the following Verses Wishes for a  Constant Spring  may properly be said to have describ'd the Blessing of  Arabia Felix  Bion  's Choice of Seasons  I love not  Summer  for the  Sun then Reigns  And  Scorches  me on the  unsheltred Plains    I love not  Autumn  for  Diseases then  Bred by her  Fruits  afflict the  Healthiest Men    Pernicious Winter  does sharp  Snows  create  And all  ColdWeather Nature  bids me hate  Let  Spring  that  longwish'd Season  then appear  And bless me with her  Presence  all the  Year  For  then  we neither  Heat  nor  Cold  can fear  All Things look  smiling then Nature  grows  Gay  And  Men  divide their  Hours  in  equal Night  and  Day  CHAP XLVII Of the  RedSea  THE  RedSea  is so fully known already by the  Geographical  De∣scriptions of our own Country Writers and the exquisite Per∣formances of the  Mathematic  Authors of most  Christian  Nations that I mean not  here  to Touch on those  notorious  Observa∣tions which have  long ago  been made by others but inform my Rea∣der of some  new Discoveries  of little matters which I made my self  BUT first it will be Requisite to say a Word or two relating to the  Etymology  and  Ports  of the  RedSea  which having done I will proceed to mention the Remarks I made as they occur to my Remembrance  Why the  RedSea  is so call'd  RHYTHRA  in the  old Egyptian Language  signifying  Red  was for∣merly the Name of a  great Monarch  of that Country who gave the  Sea  his own  Denomination  which has been since mistaken by affinity of Sound and  Misinterpreted  the  RedSea  by those who fix'd the Name upon it which it bears at present  A Second O∣pinion  OTHERS think especially the  Jews  Inhabiting the  Eastern Coun∣tries  that it was call'd the  RedSea  from the prodigious ruin and great overthrow of  Pharaohs  Army in their Passage over it in the  pursuit  of  Moses  and his  Goddefended Israelites  but as the Blood there Spilt was very little tho' such  Multitudes  were Drown'd I look upon this guess as an Improbable Opinion  A Third and the most pro∣bable  ANOTHER Notion and perhaps the truest of the Three is that 'tis call'd the  RedSea  from the  Redness  of the  Sands  o'erspreading all the Bottom whence the Waves receive a kind of  red Reflection  and the  Water  thence appears as if 'twere stain'd with certain  Juices  of a  redish Colour  This is made more Reasonable from the Etymology of the  Euxine  com∣monly call'd the  BlackSea  from the  Blackness  of the  Sands  which lie at the Bottom  THE  Sea Port Towns  are very numerous and very different from each other in  Magnificence  or the  conventency  of  Harbour  some are much ex∣pos'd to dangerous shelves and Rocky Shallows others both commodious large and stately  Aden  the great  SeaPort Town  but the only Place deserving a particular Description is the Port call'd  Aden  in Possession of the  Turks  and not alone the Largest but the Richest and most celebrated  Sea Port Town  of all  Arabia  Its Descripti∣on  IT is Situated in about  thirteen Degrees of Northern Latitude  direct¦ly in the Center of a kind of  Amphitheatre  or  Semicircular Ridge of Moun∣tains  jetting out prodigious  Promontories  into the  Sea  for a considerable Length on either  Horn  the  Harbour  is not only safe but capable of holding at an  Anchor  near a  Thousand Sail of Ships  by the most modest Computation  The Town how built  THE Town it self consists of near four thousand Houses built of Stone and rendred Pleasant by vast  Spaces  unemploy'd to other Uses than the Planting  Orchards Gardens  and a kind of  Favorite Wildernesses  much in Pra∣ctice with the  Eastern People  THE  General Inhabitants  of  Aden  are considerably  Wealthy  and enjoy their Pleasures with a greater Gust than elsewhere is permitted them  Now much decay'd  yet is the  City  much decay'd from what it has been formerly for  once  the  Town  extended to a double Length to that it  now  contains and all the Buildings tho' they are not despicable  now  were  anciently  adorn'd with a far grea∣ter  Beauty  and  Magnificence  The Fleets of the  RedSea  THE  Turks  build Vessels in the  Ports  belonging to  this Sea  and con∣stantly maintain a Fleet of Gallies for support of their  Authority  besides the  Merchant Ships  which  Trade  about from Place to Place and by the  Customs  paid on the  Commodities  they carry bring considerable Profit to the Coffers of the  Sultan  A new Dis∣covery of a Monument near the  RedSea  UPON the  Northern Shore  of the  RedSea  not far from a small Haven now call'd  Pozi  stand the  Ruins  of a  Monumental Heap of Stones  appearing very ancient by their Forms and way of Building By the Remnant of the  Work  we may suppose it to have been Erected  Pyramidically  and about one hundred Foot in height the breadth of each square of its  Basis  much the same upon the  bottom Stones  and certain  fallen  ones we cou'd discover unintelligible  Characters  which seem'd to have been  Carv'd  to tell succeeding  Ages  what the  Monument  was there  Erected  to perpetuate the Memory of  'TIS pity  Ignorance  has incapacitated the Inhabitants from letting Strangers into any  Light of Knowledge  in relation to  Antiquity  else probably they had been able to inform us what this  Heap  of  Ruins  was  Originally    Thought to be the same which  Moses  left in Memo∣ry of his Passage  Now we can no more than guess at random for its doubtful  Origin  unless we will believe the  not impossible  Traditional Account the  Natives  give us who wou'd fain perswade us to believe 'twas built by  Moses  when the  Israelites  miraculously pass'd that  Sea  and left by him a  Memorandum  for  Posterity  to make  Mankind  depend on  God  and not diffide in his  secure Pro∣tection  tho' reduc'd to never so fatiguing and oppressive  Exigencies  Opium  made of  Poppies  THERE grows upon the Shores of the  RedSea  a certain heavyheaded  Poppy  only differing in the bigness of its  Stalk  from ours in  England  At a certain Season of the Year I think it is  July  or  June  they gather many of these  Poppies  beat 'em in a  Mortar  lay them by for many Days then take 'em out and adding several unknown Herbs make  Opium  of the Composi∣tion but of far less Efficacy than the other sort more frequently  Exported  into Foreign Countries  Indigo  how made of an Herb  THERE likewise grows a little  Violet colour'd Herb  in mighty Plenty all about the Sea Shore which they take care to gather in the  Sun's Meri∣dian Height  and mixing it with certain  Weeds  which float like scatter'd  Samphire  on the Surface of the Waters make thereof the  Die  call'd  Indigo  in full Perfection  Pearls found in the  RedSea  MIGHTY  Rocks  in many Parts of the  RedSea  erect their Heads a∣bove the Water and it is not seldom that they find upon them something like a  ShellFish  yet unlike an  Oyster  which is open'd with the greatest Diffi∣culty imaginable and contains within it great round  Pearls  sometimes but  one  and sometimes  more  of equal Value with the richest of their  Magni∣tude  from any  other  Part imported into  Christendom  A wonderful Fish  AT certain Seasons of the Year it is a common thing to see a  Fish  not much unlike an  Hippotamus  or great  River Horse  whose Strength and Swiftness is so very wonderful that 'tis almost impossible to take 'em but by some Surprize or Cunning Stratagem  A rich Per∣fume  THESE  Creatures  when they happen to be caught are carefully Dissected for besides a kind of rich  Perfume  beyond the scent of  Amber∣grease  it self which lies like  Fat  about their  Spinal Joints  and yields a vast Advantage to the Man who finds it  A Carbuncle found in the Head of a SeaHorse  there often is discover'd in the  Head  of this strange  Animal  a glitt'ring  Stone  which may be call'd a  Carbun∣cle  for it is of  Globelike Form  and quite  Transparent  yielding if produc'd in a  Dark Place  a  Light  so striking that a Man may see to  Write  by its Assistance in the duskiest Winter's Midnight  The Danger of attempting more Disco∣veries  THESE are all the Observations I cou'd make deserving my  Remem∣brance  nor can any Man discover in this  Sea  or upon its extensive  Shores  more  Rarities  or  Creatures  worth Remark than have already been communi∣cated in the Books of  Travellers  unless his Curiosity becoming Master of his  Reason  tempts him to a rash Endeavour of opposing  Laws  and  Dangers  to Instruct himself in Matters probably unworthy half his Labours  CHAP XLVIII Of the  Turks  Pilgrimage to their  Prophet  's BirthPlace and their Ceremonies at  Mecca  and  Me∣dina Telnabi  The force of Superstition  NEVER sure did a  Bigotted Superstition  lead away the  Minds  of Thoughtless  Mortals  to so wond'rous a degree as it has done in  Turkey  where the  Annual  Practice of a  Pilgrimage  to  Mecca  has pre∣vail'd so strangely by the fix'd Injunction of their  Prophet  's Law that 'tis by all believ'd the surest  Passport  from  Mortality  to  Paradise  A strange Notion  NAY they carry it still  farther  and persist in the  Assertion  that unless a  Turk  shall  once  at least before he Dies perform that  Pilgrimage  or bear the Charges of some other Man to do it for him if the want of  Health  pre∣vents his  Piety  it is impossible that he should ever reach those gross  En∣joyments  they expect from the Romantic  Blessings  of another  World  till they have Purified their Persons from the  Guilt  of such  Omission  by a long con∣tinuance in the  Tortures  of the  Grave  inslicted on them by the two  Black Angels  as I have  at large  inform'd you in the  Part Foregoing  Moral Re∣flections  OH Miserable  Frailty  of deceiv'd  Mortality  so strangely open to the strong  Assaults  of our  mistaken Passions  and unguarded commonly against the weakest  Efforts  made by  Nature  to delude our  Senses  but by far more liable to the  Perswasive Ills  of  Superstitious Zeal  and the  Deceitful Gloss  of an  Ill∣chose Religion There  our Vices sculk with undetected  Art  behind the  Masque  of a pretended  Vertue  And how easily  alas  are we  misled  in Exe∣cution of our Duty when the  Dictates  of our  Reason  are themselves too often  Biass'd  to a Partial Sentence and our  Judgment  which should ever Rule a  Wise Man  's Actions  Brib'd  unfortunately by Erroneous  Principles  A vulgar Er∣ror concer∣ning  Maho∣met  's Tomb  HOWEVER e'er I enter on the  Subject  of the  Chapter  I am  now  a∣bout to  treat of  I will undeceive my Reader who has probably been  led a∣stray  like many others by a  Vulgar Error  which inclines them to believe that  Mecca  as the Place to which the  Turks  direct their  Pilgrimage  is the Town wherein the  Great Impostor Mahomet  lies Buried when it really is no other than his  BirthPlace  and as such made  Holy  by his own Injunctions that  with such and such appointed Ceremonies  all his  Followers  shou'd Visit that Great  City  in Commemoration of his being  thence  produc'd amongst them  Of  Mecca  and  Medina  SOME few Days Journey  North  of  Mecca  stands the Celebrated  Tomb  of  Mahomet  in a small Town distinguish'd by the Name of  Medina Telnabi  where he Died and  now  lies Buried in the  Form  I shall describe hereafter No  Believer  as they call themselves is by their  Prophet  's Law  oblig'd  to Visit this Place in their  Pilgrimage  but as they were assur'd by the  Impostor  that if not a  Meritorious  'twou'd at least be an  Acceptable  Acknowledgment  of  Zeal  for their  Religion  and  his Memory  'tis never known that any  Annual Pilgrimage  is made to  Mecca  but a certain Number of the most  Bigotted  of the  People  turn aside and pay their Offerings e're they return to  Medina Telnabi  Another Vulgar Error  AND here another vulgar Error challenges a  Confutation  which  Expe∣rience  as the surest  Judge  may be allow'd to give it 'Tis a general Be∣lief that  Mahomet  was never Buried but is hung suspended in the  Air  within an  Iron Coffin  by the strange attractive Force of certain wond'rous  LoadStones  so surprizingly affix'd to the high  Roof  of a great  Temple  that they cannot be perceiv'd by the most exquisite  Inspection  Very Ground∣less  THAT this is  false  the Reader will discover presently but  whence  it grew so common a  Report  I can by no means guess since I have ever found the  Turks  so far from justifying the  Pretended Miracle  that they  exert  their ut∣most  Wit  and  Raillery  to ridicule the fond  Credulity  of  Christian Nations led  so easily to a  Belief  of such a  Gross Absurdity  The Place of Rendezvous  THE Numbers which compose the Mighty  Caravan  of  Meccan Pilgrims  generally swell beyond Imagination  Zealous Turks  of every  Country Quali∣ty Profession  or  Capacity  assemble at  Grand Cairo  the Great  Rendezvouz  ap∣pointed for that purpose by the first of  August  or within a few Days af∣ter for about the tenth or fifteenth of that Month the  Caravan  most com∣monly sets forward on the  Journey  Their Publick Proclamati∣ons  WITHIN six Days of their  Departure  Notice is by  Publick Proclama∣tion  given the  People  to get ready by the  Time  then set and that they must be subject to the Government of  such a Person  whom they Name both  Go∣ing  and  Returning  in whatever  Cases  may require his  Arbitration  Their Chief how chosen  THIS  Officer  is call'd  Emir Hadgey  which signifies as much as  Ruler  of the  Pilgrims  He is always chosen by the  Great Bashaw  of  Cairo  and makes a vast Advantage of his  Post  besides the settled Sum of near two thousand Pounds which he receives from the  Grand Signior  's Treasury by many  Perquisites  and  Opportunities  of  Gain  like  these  which follow  The Order observ'd in Registring their Names  AS soon as the  EmirHadgey  is Proclaim'd all  People  who accompany the  Caravan  must presently resort to him or one deputed by him paying a considerable Sum of Money for the  Regist'ring  their  Names  the number of their  Camels  and the  Names Religion Quality  and  Sects  of every  Passenger  they carry on them  The  EmirHadgey  's Pow∣er  HIS  Power  is so Unlimited and so Decisive is his  Sentence  while the  Ex∣pedition  lasts extending even to  Life  and  Death  and every little Matter  Criminal  or  Civil  that to Bribe his  Favour  no rich Gifts are thought too Costly nor that Money ill bestow'd which recommending those who give it to the favourable Eye of such an  Arbitrary Ruler  frequently prevents the Hand of Rapine from Invading their most valuable Property  His Perqui∣sites  ANOTHER Perquisite and that no mean one rises from a  Law  Severe and Barbarous by which all  Christians  whatsoever are Prohibited from coming within three Days  Journey  of their  Prophet's BirthPlace  or his Place of  Burial  while the  Pilgrims  are employ'd at  either  in the Ceremoni∣ous Practices of  Zeal  and  Superstition  The  Turks  true to In∣terest  For notwithstanding this Decree if any  Europaean Traveller  has Courage to confide in the  Fidelity  of  Turks  and really where their  Interest  binds them they are generally very Pun∣ctual in Performance of their  Articles  he may by making a considera∣ble Present to the  EmirHadgey  not alone be sure of his Protection in the  Places abovemention'd but possess an undisputed Liberty to Travel openly throughout the Journey and select what Company he pleases to Converse with in the  Caravan  which he accompanies  WHEN every thing is ready all the  Caravan  have  Publick Orders  pre∣sently to quit the Town and Rendezvouz Fifteen Miles from it in an open sandy  Plain  along the Borders of a  Pool  call'd  Birquey  The Gallan∣try of the  EmirHadgey  HITHER two Days after the  EmirHadgey  comes gallantly atten∣ded by a Company of such among them as pretend to be distinguish'd by the Name of  Gentlemen  and have resolv'd that Year to make the  Pilgri∣mage  All these have many Servants waiting on them with a tripple Change of  Camels  to prevent the Inconveniencies they might be otherwise expos'd to by the accidental Deaths of those they rode on  The Dress of his  Camels  ALL the  Camels  are adorn'd as finely as is possible with  Ribbons Spangles Rich Caparisons  and every other  Gay Contrivance  which may serve to shew the  Ʋniversal Joy  with which they snatch the  wish'd Occasion  of so  Troublesome  and  Dangerous  but  Holy  a  Peregrination  The  Alcoran  how carried  AMONG the  Camels  which compose the Number for the proper use of the  EmirHadgey  one Venerable  Old one  is elected to be richly Orna∣mented with  Embroider'd Trappings  thick beset with  Precious Stones  of ad∣mirable  Lustre  on whose Back is carried a square Golden  Box  which holds the  Alcoran  extravagantly Bound and all enrich'd with  valuable Jewels  yearly sent by the  Grand Signior  as an  Offering  due to the Great  Mosque  of  Mecca  in respect to  Mahomet  Camels  how respected at their Return from  Mecca  THIS  Camel  if it happens to outlive the Journey is for ever after  free  from  Labour  as indeed most others are which have return'd in Safety if their  Owners  can afford it and Interr'd upon their  Death  in  Orchards Gar∣dens  or some other private Place that so they may not be expos'd like other Beasts to  Dogs  and  Vultures  The Depar∣ture of the  Caravan  AS soon as the Arrival of the  EmirHadgey  has been confirm'd through∣out the Camp for they Pitch Tents like Armies all the  Caravan  make ready in an Instant and the  Women Children  and  Acquaintance  of the  Pilgrims  who have hitherto accompanied them begin with  Prayers Tears Kisses  close  Embraces  and a Thousand Marks of Friendship and Affection to take leave of all they know and recommend them to the Smiles and Care of  Providence  so that for a considerable time there's nothing to be seen but a confus'd Extravagance of Sorrow and its Consequences  Their Order in Marching  NOW the  Caravan  begins to March the  EmirHadgey  riding at their Head or sometimes in their Center as he thinks most proper All the  Camels  are ty'd Tail to Tail and follow one another in strait  Lines  of diffe∣rent length some Hundreds often going in a Knot their  Riders  sitting on them in the Posture elsewhere spoke of in this  Treatise  and some Thousands of the most accomplish'd  Warriors  in a manner quite surrounding the whole  Caravan  protect them from the Dangers they are often subject to in the Attacks they meet with from the  Wild Arabians  who insest the  Desarts  Their A∣musements on the Road  THEY are generally very Merry sounding all the way an Hundred aukward  Instruments  of  Musick  and diverting one another with the tedious Repetitions of such  Old Wives Tales  as commonly pass Current in the Con∣versation of the Vulgar People of the  Eastern  Countries  Their Lights on the Jour∣ney  THE Violence of Heat is so excessive in the  Climates  they are bound to pass thro' that they seldom Travel much by  Day  and therefore carry a prodigious Quantity of  Links  or  Flambeaus  for the Lighting them along and really when the  Moon  denies her Influence in directing their  Advances  they supply the want occasion'd by her Absence with such glorious Num∣bers of these  Flaming Torches  as afford a Prospect so surprizingly agreeable that 'tis not to be guess'd by such as have not seen it  The Dangers they are sub∣ject to  THE Sultry  Influences  of a  scorching Sun  and  Pestilential Blasts  of an unwholesome  Southern Wind  together with the  want  of  Water Bitter Springs  excepted and the Scarcity of all  Provisions  with a Thousand  una∣vordable Fatigues  they meet with in so long and disagreeable a  Journey  fre∣quently occasion such  Mortality  among the  Caravan  that 'tis a common thing in its  Return  to  Cairo  to have left  Eight Thousand Persons  Dead be∣hind them  Their com∣mon Num∣bers  AS for the  Numbers  which this  Annual Caravan  does commonly consist of they are so uncertain that I cannot form a General Calculation  better  than by telling you that they are seldom known below the Full of  Fifty Thousand Souls  but very often to a great degree exceed an  Hundred  Another of the  Emir  's Perquisites  ALL the  Goods Cloaths Camels  and  Conveniencies  belonging to  such  Persons as sall Sick and Die upon the  Journey  are the  Property  by  Perquisite  of the  EmirHadgey  who unless a Man of admirable  Principles  is con∣sequently no great  Wellwisher  to the Welfare of his  People  The Distance between  Grand Cairo  and  Mecca  THE Distance between  Mecca  and  Grand Cairo  is  Five and Forty large Days Journey  in which Passage they are forc'd to  Rest Three Days together  such is the Fatigue of Travelling upon a Desart Country where the  Sands  unstable to the Footsteps of their  Beasts  of  Burthen  slip away and make the  Roads  extreamly tiresome  A Remark concerning  Camels  AND here we have a spacious Scene for  Contemplation  on the  Alldirect∣ing Wisdom  of the Hand of  Providence  who in the Countries naturally Stony has provided  Horses  of a hard and solid  Hoof  to serve the  Ʋses  they are there design'd for But in Desart Places such as these I now am speaking of has form'd the  Camel  qualified by Nature with her spreading  Fool  to overtread more easily the sinking  Sands  which  Horses Hoofs  with difficulty pass thro'  The Place call'd  Marah  in the Scriptures  TWO Days from  Cairo  bring the  Caravan  to a Place call'd  MizHaana  anciently that  Marah  spoke of in the  Scriptures  whither  Moses  brought the  Israelites  just  then  deliver'd from  Egyptian Bondage  and Miraculously Aided by  Almighty God  's assisting Hand converted  bitter Waters  into  sweet  by throwing in a  Tree  cut down on purpose  thence  supplying all the Peoples raging Thirst who Murmur'd loudly  that they cou'd not Drink for the wa∣ters of  Marah  were Bitter  The Stages of the  Caravan  THENCE proceeding onwards of their  Journey  they Encamp on many of those very Places where so many Ages since the discontented  Israelites then  wandring in the  Wilderness  by God's Direction Pitch'd their  Tents  and lay a while in expectation of the Orders  Moses  was to give them whither  next  to bend their  Progress  Abraham's  Mountain  WITHIN near Threescore Miles of  Mecca  stands a Village call'd  Babble  scarce Three Furlongs distant from the Mountain of that  Name  on whose high  Summit Abraham  built the Altar upon which he had design'd to Sacrifice his  only Son  his  muchlov'd Isaac  in Obedience to the Will of that  Great God  whose least  Command  he knew it Sin to think of Disre∣garding  Isaac  's Altar  THERE is upon the Top of this fam'd  Mountain  a low kind of  Turkish Mosque  or  Chappel  built obscurely of an Antique Model in the midst whereof they show a small square Heap of Stones join'd fast together with a lasting Mortar not much less than three Foot high six long and four in breadth which they have dignified with a strange Reputation and are sure to show all Pilgrims who come thither by the Name of  Isaac  's  Altar  The Story why impro∣bable  'TIS I must confess a little inconsistent with  my Notion  of the  Rules  of  Reason  to imagine  Abraham  as we read the Story shou'd have taken Pains to build so strong and durable a  Monument  whereon to  Sacrifice  his  Son  upon so short a Warning and it therefore must require a  Romish Faith  to look up∣on this  Altar  as a  Relique  of  Antiquity  The Ceremo∣nies of the Pil∣grims on this Hill  THE  Mosque  however which is built upon this  Hill  is constantly In∣habited by some  Old Scheich  or  Turkish Preacher  who is bound by the  Con∣ditions  upon which he claims a  Salary  belonging to the  Benefice  to stand up∣on the  Hill  and make a  Declanition  or a kind of  Lecture  to the  Pilgrims  who assemble round him those who happen to get nearest telling  those  at greater distance what they learn from the Perswasive Oratory of their  Preachers Doctrine  The Subject of a Sermon there Preach'd  THE common  Subjects  which are chose on this Occasion for Employ∣ment of the  Doctor's Lungs  and  Faculties  are such as an  Endeavour  to  Ingraft  a Pious Notion in the Peoples Breast of that  Important Duty  they are now performing the Necessity there is of a  Repentance  after it and the innume∣rable  Blessings  they may certainly expect from  God's Indulgence  if they ne∣ver deviate from the Principles of  Zealous MussulMen  and  TrueBelievers  of the  Laws  of  Mahomet  The  Turkish  way of quit∣ting Sin  THEY rest a  Day  upon the  Old Man  's Sermon to digest the  Entertainment  he has gravely given them and  then  are  led  by the  EmirHadgey  on Foot without observing Rank all one by one to the abovenam'd  Mosque  upon the Mountain  Rabiie  which they  enter  at one  Door  and  go out  of by another opposite thereto first passing by the  Grave Old Scheich  aforesaid who is plac'd upon a  Step  near two Foot high directly in the middle of the  Mosque  and touching every Man as he goes swiftly by with a short  Stick  repeats these Words  May Sin here leave thee  A strange No∣tion  NOW you must understand the  Holy Wishes  of this  Favorite  of  Maho∣met  are so Successful that they never fail to crown the Person Bless'd with an entire Deliverance from all the  Vices  he was ever subject to so that freed happily from such a  weighty Burthen  they run nimbly down the Hill upon the other side and never stop till they have cross'd a little  Stream  of  Bitter Water  gliding by the Bottom and by dipping in their Hands and sprinkling all their Faces with some Drops thereof from that time forward they become  NewMen  as Pure and Free from all  Iniquity  as  Infant Inno∣cence  and consequently Qualified to see the  City  they must next proceed to  A stranger Punishment  BUT you must take notice that the  Punishment  of looking back before they Cross this  Purifying Stream  is full as Exemplary to these  Cautious Pil∣grims  as it was of Old to  Lot  's too Curious Wife For tho' their  Meta∣morphosis  appears not so amazingly conspicuous yet they'll tell you that 'tis fully as severe for in the very Moment any Man among them turns  his  Head  before it is permitted him the heavy Load of his  own Sins  which he had just before made shift to leave behind him does not only overtake him in an  Instant  but returns enrich'd  with Interest upon Interest  by the Black  Addition  of two  other Peoples  Their Cere∣monies at first sight of  Mec∣ca  CAREFUL therefore to prevent so Burthensome a Mischief on they march with joyful Hearts to the Remainder of their  Journey  and a∣bout the middle of the third Days  Progress  gain a Prospect of the  Mosque  at  Mecca  when they all alight as if  half mad  with noisy  Extasies  and pro∣strating themselves upon the  Ground  thrice  kiss  the glowing Surface of the  Sand  they Travel on and  thrice  Proclaim with Universal Clamour  AllahIllahIlallab Muhamed Resul Allah God is God the only God and Mahomet of that sole God the only Prophet  How they En∣camp at  Mec∣ca  ARRIV'D at  Mecca  they Encamp upon the  Plains  without the City as by far too numerous to find Conveniencies within the  Walls  for a  Commodious Entertainment  of  Themselves  and  Camels  But I should have told you that they often turn  aside  and pass thro'  Giddah  the  PortTown  to  Mec∣ca  to pay Reverence to the  Grave  where  Eve  was Buried  The Tomb of  Eve  for the  Arabs there  pretend to show all  Travellers  her  Sepulchre  and wou'd perswade us to believe our Father  Adam  had a very  Formidable Consort  if we are allow'd to guess her  Strength  by the  Proportion  which they give her for from the  Stone  now standing at the  Head  to  that  which stands at the broad  Bottom  of the  Grave  the Distance is full Five and Twenty  Yards  of  English  Mea∣sure Sure a Man if any now is Bless'd with such a  Wife  wou'd scarce lament her want of  Stature  Description of  Mecca  MECCA  is about Three Miles in Compass Rich and Stately in a great degree and her Inhabitants Possessors of a  Rolling Plenty  still continue to encrease their  Affluence  by Annual  Profits  rising from the Concourse of such  mighty Numbers  drawn by  Zeal  to Travel thither  BUT as I only mention it because the BirthPlace of that  Vile Impostor  whose successful  Impositions  drew such Numbers to profess his  Doctrine  I will here enlarge no further than is requisite to give a just Description of the  Holy House of God  as they presume to call it which is look'd upon so Sacred by the  Turks  that in whatever Part of the wide  Ʋniverse  they are  Why the  Turks  in Praying turn their Fa∣ces to the  East  they never Pray but with their Faces to the  East  in Honour to this House wherein they say that  Mahomet  was Born and in respect to which they  yearly  undertake so dangerous a  Pilgrimage  The House of God as they call it  THIS House which they distinguish by the Name of  Kiabee Betulla  stands directly in the middle of the City not surpassing Thirteen Foot in  Breadth  in  Length  Eighteen or thereabouts and near Ten Yards in  Height  FlatRoof'd and quite surrounded by a stately  Court  Wall'd in and Orna∣mented by Three several Rows of  Marble Pillars  close within the  Wall  supporting  Arches  of a  Graceful Fabrick  upon either Square divided into  Four Apartments  kept by  Priests  of the Four most noted Sects among the  Turks  who Pray continually with an  incessant Fervour  for the  Boundless Propagation  of their own  Religion  and the  Downfal  of  Christianity  Two Hoops of Gold  TO strengthen as it were the  Ancient Building  which  I think  consists of Square Rough  Stones  tho' it is almost impossible to see them being cover'd on the  Inside  and the  Out  by such inestimable heaps of  Riches  the House is Circled round by  two prodigious Hoops  of  Beaten Gold  at least ap∣pearing so to be and of that valuable Metal are the  Drains  and  Spouts  which carry off the Water falling on the Place in  Rainy Weather  A Silver Door and strange Old Fashion'd En∣trance  THE only Entrance contrary to  any  Buildings  now  in  Fashion  or in∣deed Remembrance is by two large  Folding Silver Doors  to which you mount upon a  Ladder  five Foot high for so much higher than the  Ground  about it reaches the  Foundation  of this Odd and Antique Piece of  Buil∣ding  Stately Hang∣ings  THIS Door is plac'd almost as far as the left Corner of the  House  and being enter'd  presently  admits you to the only  Chamber  it consists of rich∣ly Hung with an  Embroider'd Damask  Red and Green  the last the Pro∣phet's Favorite Colour  and supported by four Pillars the Diameter of each above two Foot entirely of a Piece their  Form  eight Square and made of a black kind of  Wood  perfuming all the  Chamber  with the  finest Scent ima∣ginable  which the  Turks  assur'd us were not so by  Nature  but became thus  Odoriferous  the very Moment their  Prophet  Bless'd that  Place  in his  Nativity  A fine good∣natur'd mo∣ving Stone  WITHOUT the  House  they show a dusky Colour'd  Stone  near two Foot Square to which they  Kneel  and pay their  Adoration  with a thousand  Kisses  and indeed the Reputation which this  Stone  has got deserves their  Complaisance  for the Civility it  once  was Master of  That was ve∣ry Civil to Father  Abra∣ham  For you must know this  House  was built by  Abraham  's own Hands who knew by Holy  Inspiration  what an Honour it was destin'd to in  After Ages  and unwilling therefore to  abuse  the  Walls  when he had  rais'd  them pretty high by making Holes to fix a  Scaffold  in he modestly resolv'd to stand upon this  Stone  which  then  lay there  by chance  and  build  as high as he cou'd  reach  by its  Assistance  which it seems was so extreamly  taken  with the  Patriarch's GoodNature  that it gra∣dually rose and lifted him about from Place to Place till he had made an End of all the  Building  The Ceremo∣nies here per∣form'd  HITHER then the  Pilgrims  come as many  at a time  as the  EmirHadgey  thinks fit to send together least they shou'd Affront the  Holy Place  by overcrowding its  Approaches  The only Ceremonies  here  Perform'd are  Falling Prostrate on the Earth and Blessing God  who has permitted them to see a  Sight  so  Sacred  then repeating certain  Prayers  they pass in Order thro' the Pillars of the four Apartments of the  Sects  abovenam'd and are  Bless'd  and  Kiss'd  by the respective  Priests  of each Opinion after which they Walk out  backwards  till they pass the utmost  Limits  of this  Venerable Fa∣brick  Hangings out in Pieces to make Re∣liques  NOTHING rests deserving our Remark but that a  black Silk Cano∣py  which covers all the  Roof  of this Fine  House  is chang'd for  one  renew'd  each Year  at the Expence of the  Grand Signior  and by him sent  thither  with the  Caravan  of  Pilgrims  while the  Old One  by the  Priests  is cut in many thousand Pieces and distributed among the Superstitious People  by the way of Sale  with a Pretence that those who bear that  Holy Relique  still about them shall be ever free from  sudden Death  and  unexpected Dangers  of what kind soever  Medina Telna∣bi  HENCE such People as are led by  Zeal  to think their Duty Sum∣mons them to see their  Prophet's Tomb  accompany the  Caravan  which goes from  Mecca  to  Damascus  and arrive in eight or ten Days time at  Medina Tel∣nabi  much about the Magnitude of  Mecca  The Tombs of  Mahomet Os∣min  and  Hali  HERE in an obscure and narrow  Corner  of a  Stately Mosque  which stands directly in the middle of the  Town  are seen the  Sepulchres  of the  Impo∣stor Mahomet  and his two  Famous Followers Osmin  and  Haly  Description of the Tombs  THE Tombs are low and narrow of a  Lozenge Cut  and fram'd of Marble of a very Black or Dusky Colour void of any kind of  Ornament  or  Writing  whatsoever and inclos'd within three round and high built  Mar∣ble Turrets  thro' whose Sides are cut small narrow Windows into which the  Pilgrims  look and see the  Tombs  of their  respected Prophets That  of  Ma∣homet  's the middlemost of all the  Three  The Towers enclosing them  THESE Turrets are adorn'd with little  Galleries  of  Gold  and  Silver  which together with the  Inward  and  External Sides  of all the  Towers  are richly Ornamented with innumerable quantities of Precious Stones of an  inesti∣mable Value Great Half Moons  of  Gold  and  Diamonds Chains of Pearl  and  Crowns of Jewels  Glorious Or∣naments  every here and there  appearing  Writ in  Golden Letters  the repeated  Names  of  God  and  Mahomet  between the different kinds of Trea∣sure which for many Ages have been sent as  Offerings  from the Superstitious Princes who Profess  Mahometanism  The Depar∣ture of the Pilgrims  HERE the  Pilgrims  gain a second  Blessing  and return as soon as they have seen the  Tombs  to reach the  Caravan  which waits their coming back at  Mecca  and advance towards  Egypt  in the  Order  they came  thence  with Many Drunk or Mad with  Zealous Folly  bore their Eyes or hold them over burning Irons till they lose their  Sight  as thinking it a  Sin  beyond excuse to look on  Groveling Earthly Vileness  after they have  once  been Bless'd with so  Divine  and  Longdesir'd  a Prospect  CHAP XLIX Of the  Arabians  their Government and way of Living  The Descent of the  Arabs  THE  Arabs  are Descended as is commonly believ'd from  Ish∣mael  dwelling  now  as  anciently  they did in  Tents  and  open Pla∣ces  nothing differing from what they were when the  Inspir'd Historians  of the  Holy Scriptures  writ their Character and handed down the Nature of those Barbarous People to the Knowledge of  Posterity  The Etymo∣logy of  Sara∣cen  THEY are distinguish'd likewise by the Name of  Saracens  from the  Arabian Etymology  of  SaaraSaaken  which in  English  signifies as much as an  Inhabitant of Desart Countries  Description of the  Arabs  THEY are generally Men of Middle Stature  swift  and  daring  very  Lean  and wonderfully  Bony Tawny  to a strange Degree by the perpetual Influence of an unshadow'd  Sun  which burns 'em in the  Desarts  They are shrill of Voice beyond most  Women  and inclin'd by  Nature  to the Cruel Practices of an  unlimited Barbarity  Their Pride  THEIR  Pride  exceeds most other  Nations  for they scorn  Dependance  and reject all Notions of a  Lawful Government  They boast  Antiquity  and not unjustly  Glorying  in that they have in the continued Course of such a  mighty Number  of  successive Ages  kept themselves  unmix'd  with  other Nati∣ons  and obtain'd an  undisputed Claim  to not alone the  Ancientest  but  Purest Titles of Nobility now  extant in the  Ʋniverse  by an obstinate Contempt of all  Mechanical Employments  and depending solely on their  Arms  and  Cou∣rage  for the  Means  of their  Subsistance  Their way of Living  HENCE they Ravage all they meet with live in  Plunder  and infest the  Desarts  with a  Lawless Multitude  of  Great  and  Little Parties  Robbing and Destroying all they  Conquer  if they presume to make Resistance after which they suddenly retire behind such endless  Tracts  of  unknown Sand  that none can follow them with Force sufficient to repel their Numbers  Why 'tis im∣possible to  Conquer  them  'TIS esteem'd  impossible  to Conquer  throughly  these ungovernable Peo∣ple for they ride on  Horses  of peculiar Skill in tracing out the Passages of the unstable  Desarts  and can live on very small and poor Provisions and by frequenting constantly those Barren Places know the Ground so very well that no great  Number  can attempt pursuing them but they must perish by the want of  Food  and  Water  e'er they can  with Reason  hope to find the Pri∣vate Lurking Corners of their  Nimble Enemies  who never fail to watch the Moment of some favourable Opportunity to fall upon 'em under Covert of the  Night  with bloody Execution  Their Arms  THEY little  understand  and less  esteem  the Use of  FireArms  all their  Weapons  are a kind of  Spears  not much unlike an  Officer  's  HalfPike  in  England  headed with a  Cap  of  Steel sharppointed  and of admirable  Temper  which they  Poize  with an extended Arm and either hurl at distance or can use in  close Fight  with an  Enemy  as they may  see Occasion  Their strange Dexterity  SECONDLY they are the surest  Archers  in the  World  and general∣ly Arm themselves with a Capacious  Quiver  of  Steelheaded Arrows  some of which are always Poyson'd These they  Shoot  with such a strange Dexterity on  Horseback  or on  Foot  That like the Ancient  Parthians  fam'd in  History  they  Kill  more  Enemies  in their  Retreat  from a  lost Battle  than they  Slaugh∣ter'd  all the time  before  while  Face to Face  they stood the  Shock  of  Open War  and Fought for  Victory  Their Roving Life  THEY live as I have said before in  Tents  and Pitch their  Camps  from time to time where any little  Face  of  Pasture  for their  Horses  or the Prospect of the most Advantages from  Robbing Caravans  invite their Stay Removing frequently from one Place to another carrying with them all the Cities they pretend to  dwell in  and the Families which they are Masters of  Their Form of Govern∣ment  THEY are divided into  Tribes  or  Companies  and pay a kind of  Reve∣rence  to certain  Princes  as they call 'em who by long Descent of Noble Blood beyond the rest are Honour'd by the  Tribes  and constantly Preside in all their  Councils  Guiding as they please tho' not assuming a  Comman∣ding Power  the Business of the People who  respect  'em greatly tho' no o∣therwise distinguish'd from the Common People than by wearing  Turbants  of a different Form but equal Bigness  Their Habits and Diet  c  THEIR  Habits  differ nothing from the  Vulgar Turks  their  Diet  is not much unlike the  Tartars  and their  Exercises few  because they live in a  per∣petual Motion  Their  Religion  is  Mahometanism  and they look upon it as no little Honour to their  Nation  that the  Prophet  was their  CountryMan  Their way of disposing of the Goods they Plunder  WHEN they have Plunder'd a Considerable  Booty  they deliver it to certain of their  People  living Peaceably on every  Border  of the  Desarts  who are suffer'd to  Converse  and  Trade  with all the  Governments  about 'em ra∣ther out of  Fear  than  Friendship  THESE find present Means to sell the  Plunder  of one  Nation  to the  Natives  of  another  and delivering the Money to the Party whence they had the  Goods  receive a certain  fix'd  Reward proportionable to the Value of the Prize while all the rest is equally divided among those who shar'd the Danger With this Money they will often buy  fine Jewels  or whatever else their  Inclinations  lead 'em to  Jewels for the Women  SINCE I have mention'd  Jewels  'twill be necessary to inform the Reader of the  Ʋses  they design 'em to which is to  Ornament  the Persons of their  Women  for they have as many  Wives  as they think fit and either carry them about as  they  remove themselves or leave them  in their Expe∣ditions  in the  Towns  or  Camps  they have upon the most  Delightful Habitable  and not  quite Infertil Borders  of  Arabia  The  Arabian  Women dreadful Creatures  I think I need not tell the  English Ladies  that the  Sun  is no great Friend to  Beauty  and the Poor  Arabian Females  find it to their Sorrows For but that their  Husbands  prove them  Women  and not  only so  but  Fruitful Women too  I shou'd not only quite  mistake their Sex  by missing in their  Souls  and  Persons  all those  soft engaging Excellencies  which combine to  Crown  the  Graces  of my  CountryWomen  but really  Misinterpret  their  Huma∣nity  by judging them some MeanerPart of the  Creation  Methinks the  Painters  who to cover the Disgraces which the  Christian Armies  frequent∣ly receiv'd by being  beaten  in the  HolyWar  by those Mens  Ancestors  took care to represent a  Saracen  upon their  SignPosts  like a  Monst'rous Gyant  so  so to give a terrible  Idea  of those People had done better far to Paint the Figure of a  Saracen  's  Wife  for all the World must have believ'd that where the  Women  were such frightful Creatures All the  Men  must have been worse than  Devils  Another kind of  Arabs  SOME  People notwithstanding  bear the Name of  Arabs  and are yet of  Principles  directly different from  these  such  for Example  as Inhabit many Places in  Arabia Felix  and some other Countries where they live in  Peace  and  Honesty  subservient to the  Laws of Civil Government  But those I speak of are the  Arabs  commonly distinguish'd by the Name of  Wild  or  Indepen∣dant  and are  every way  the  Men  I have describ'd  abhorr'd  but  dreaded  by  Mankind in General  yet above the  Anger  of  surrounding Enemies  CHAP L Probable Conjectures concerning the  Ten Tribes  of  Israel  which were carried away  Captive  by  Shalmanezer King  of  Assyria    Kings Chap    I Wou'd not have my Reader led to a Mistake of what I mean or by the  Title  of this Chapter be induc'd to think I flatter my  Belief  with an Opinion that I can inform the World more largely than all other  Writers  of the Present State of the  Ten Captiv'd Tribes  of  Broken Israel  The Aim of this Chapter  MY  only Aim  in touching on this  Subject  is to prove that those who guess the  Race  of  Turks  to be Descended from the  Jews  of the  Ten Tribes  a∣bovenam'd may  at least  defend their Notion by a very  probable  and  natural Chain  of  Arguments  if not  incontrovertible  and  certain Demonstration  Many various Opinions  MANY  notwithstanding  and extreamly  various  are the odd  Opinions  commonly receiv'd not only in the  Europaean World  but  even  in those  Eastern Parts  which by their  Old Vicinity  of  Situation  to that  Bondag'd Peo∣ple  may be thought to have retain'd an eager  Curiosity  to know  if possible  the Present Fortunes of a  Formidable Nation  which in ancient Times they not alone  Esteem'd  but held  uninterrupted  Correspondence with  AMONG the several  Judgments  or  Conjectures  made upon this  Fa∣mous Head  it may not possibly be thought  unwelcome  shou'd I  entertain  the Reader with a  Few  of the most  Celebrated Notions  prevalent in the  Opinions  of the  Knowing Ʋniverse  The first No∣tion  ONE  commonly receiv'd Opinion  is that these  Ten Tribes  of  Captiv'd Jews  went quite thro'  Tartary  to  GreenLand  so to  America  by passing by the  Straight  of  Darien  where they fix'd themselves in the Dominions of  Peru  and all those Parts distinguish'd by the Name of  Nova Hispania  or the  Spanish WestIndies  Its Proofs  TO prove the Probability of this  Assertion  its  Defenders  openly  avouch  that there are many  Ruins  extant to this Day whose own  Remains  and the  Tradition  of the  Country  join to speak them  formerly  the Work of  Jewish Ar∣chitects  In many of these  Buildings  they report to have discover'd WellWrought Nails of mighty Size which kept the  Timber  join'd together this was judg'd  Remarkable  because those  Buildings  were Erected  long  before the  Indian Natives  are suppos'd to have been made  acquainted with  the  Ʋse  of  Iron  AGAIN they judge it very Probable because the  Spanish Indians  are not of so Brown and Beardless a  Complexion  as the rest but much inclining to the  Airs  and  Features  of the  Ancient Jews  and thence believ'd to be de∣cended from them  ANOTHER Reason they produce as a Persuasive to their  Notion  is that when the  Spaniards  Conquer'd  Mexico Peru  and all those Parts of the  WestIndies  they perceiv'd their  Customs  as to  Women Altars Jubilees Divorces  and the Knowledge they profess'd of the  Creation of the World  and  Ʋniversal Deluge  with a Thousand other of their  Practices  and  Ceremo∣nies  so entirely moulded to the Imitation of the  Jewish Customs  that they cou'd not help concluding that great Numbers of the  Indians  were them∣selves Descended from those  Jews  of the  Ten Tribes  aforesaid or at least had learnt from them the Numerous  Ceremonies  they so long continued to in∣dulge the Practice of  The Second Notion of the Ten Tribes of  Israel  ANOTHER Notion not alone receiv'd among the  Jews  but almost  every Nation  in the  East  perswades them to believe that many of those  Tribes  may now be found in certain  Inland  Parts of  China  and to prove the Probability of this  Opinion  they produce a Thousand Instances of  Roman Missionary Priests  and many other Travellers who have discover'd mighty Numbers of those People in the  Land  abovenam'd who retain the Practice of the  Ancient Jewish Ceremonies  but are altogether ignorant of either the  Arrival Doctrine  or  Portentous Crucifixion  of  our Blessed Sa∣viour  The Third Notion  'TIS no improbable  Conjecture  that some  Tribes  if not all inhabit in a Country to the  South  of  Persia  commonly distinguish'd by the Name of  Tabor  for the People  there  obey one  Great  and  Arbitrary  Monarch and profess no other  Faith  than that of  Judaism  Its Proofs  THE Natives of this Country are divided into  Tribes  which  still  retain such Names as are entirely Consonant with  those  which anciently distin∣guish'd the  Lost Tribes  of  Israel  and the Name of  Tabor  which as I have said before their  Province  bears appears not widely different from  Habor  whither  Salmanezer  order'd them to be Transported as we read in  Holy Scripture  in the Second Book of  Kings  and the  Seventeenth Chapter  Kings  Ch    V    Then the  King  of  Assyria  came up throughout all the Land and went up to  Samaria  and Besieg'd it Three Years  In the Ninth Year of  Hoshea  the  King  of  Assyria  took  Sama∣ria  and carried  Israel  away into  Assyria  and placed them in  Halah  and in  Habor  by the River of  Gozan  and in the Cities of the  Medes  The Fourth Notion  THOSE are not  Few  who strenuously maintain that many Parts of  Aethiopia  are inhabited by the Posterity of these  Ten Jewish Tribes  particu∣larly near the  Lake  whence  Nilus  is supposed to take his  Rise  All the Men of this Persuasion wou'd oblige us to believe the  Abyssens Coptees  and cer∣tain other  Aethiopian Christians  owe the Practice of their  Circumcising  Chil∣dren to some Ancient Imitation of the  Custom  of the  Jews  who found a  Re∣fuge  in their  then  more  Hospitable Country  The Fifth Notion  IT is more talk'd of than believ'd that they may possibly inhabit those  unknown  and  spacious  Territories on the other side of that Prodigious  River  The Sabbati∣cal River  which  Josephus  mentions to be not far distant from the  Caspian Sea  and call'd  Sabbatical  by reason of a wondrous Secret in the Nature of its  Stream  which runs  six Days  with such amazing  Breadth  and rapid  Violence  of an  Im∣petuous Current  that by driving down the very  Stones  and  Sand  o'er which it rolls it renders it impossible for Mortal  Courage Strength  or  Artifice  to compass Means of passing it but on the  Sabbath Day  at which time all the  Waters  fall Miraculously for the space of  Four and Twenty Hours  leaving dry and passable the Sandy  Bottom  The Sixth Opinion  Mr  William Pen  in the Account he gives of  Pensilvania  tells us he believes the Natives of that Place had no  Original  but from the  Jewish Tribes  and arms the Arguments he uses on this Subject with the following Observations  Its Reasons  THAT  God  cou'd point them out with ease a Passage to  America  from the  Eastern  Parts of  Asia  and that since they were Ordain'd to be remov'd to an  Ʋntill'd  even  Ʋndiscover'd Country  'tis highly probable that the  WestIndies  was the Place since that was  then  the only unknown  Quarter  of the  Habitable Ʋniverse  AND that they rather Peopled  Pensilvania  than the other Parts of the  WestIndies  he imagines not unlikely since the Natives of that Country so resemble  Jews  in Features and Deportment that they seem distinguishably Mark'd by  God  as the Posterity of that Unhappy Nation  Jewish  Cu∣stoms in  Pen∣silvania  AGAIN their  Feasts Fasts Sacrifices  and all other Rights and Cere∣monies with the great Affinity their Language bears to  Hebrew  and a∣bundance more concurring  Circumstances  in their ways of Life agree so evidently with the  Jewish Institutions Government  and  Customs  that he judges it a very reasonable  Notion  to conclude they are descended from the  long Lost Race  of the  Subverted Israelites  The Seventh Opinion  BUT having mention'd the  foregoing  Notions  now  most common in the  Eastern World  I will proceed to let you see how probable it is that all the  Turks  are of the  Jewish Race  and that the Ten abovenam'd  Tribes  at least the greatest Remnant of them  now  reside in  Tartary  and are the People so Notorious for their  Inhumanity  so Formidable in their  Government  Un∣known in their  Condition  and so justly Dreaded by the  oft Invaded World  who only know them by the Name of  Tartars  The  Turks  De∣scended from the  Jews  I show'd the Reader in my Entrance on the Book that  Anciently  the  Turks  were an  huge Body  of  Ʋngovernable Wandring Scythians  or  Tartars  who forsook their Country for some unknown Cause and overrunning  Turco∣mania  and a Boundless Tract of Fertile  Land  became a People formidably Numerous and swell'd in time to that surprizing Pitch of  Arbitrary Sway  they boast at present  IT hence appears 'tis Universally allow'd as an  Ʋndoubted Certainty  that 'tis from  Tartary  the  Turks  first took their  Origin  It only then remains to prove that those we now call  Tartars  may be rationally thought the True Posterity of the  Ten Tribes  of  Israel  which the Conquering  Salmane∣cer  carried with him Captive as aforesaid which I shall endeavour to per∣form as Briefly as is possible  The Etymo∣logy of the word  Tartar  AND  first  the Reader may observe that  TarutHar  or  Tartar  in the  Syrian  Language signifies the  Remnant  or  Remainder  of a  People  which tho' alone an Argument of no small  weight  is strongly aided by the following  Particulars  A very proba∣ble Argu∣ment  MEDIA  Situated near the  Caspian Sea  is  now  possess'd entirely by these  Tartars  and as it appears by the abovenam'd  Text  of  Holy Writ  that the  Ten Tribes of Israel  were Transported to the Cities of the  Medes  so 'tis observable that those  few  Cities which the  Tartars  have are call'd by  Names  agreeing nearly with the  Ancient Towns  of  Israel  when She  Flou∣rish'd  Ancient Jew∣ish Names still retain'd  THUS the Capital of  Tartary  is call'd  Samaryan  which is very little different from  Samaria once  the Great  Metropolis  of  Israel  's  Monarchs  and it is observable that many  Pillars Buildings  and vast  Reliques  of  Antiquity  are yet remaining in this Town adorn'd in so demonstrative a manner that they plainly speak themselves to have been  Jewish Monuments  A River call'd  Jordan  THEY have another  Town  call'd  Jericho  a  Mount  nam'd  Sion  and a∣nother  Mount  distinguish'd by the  Name  of  Tabor  with a River  Yordan from the Hebrew Jordan  and a thousand other Names of Places plainly prove a  Jewish Etymology  The  Tartars  divided into Ten Tribes  THEY are divided into  Ten Great Tribes  or  Parties  bearing  Names  not much unlike the  Ancient Patriarchs  from whom the  Israelites  receiv'd their  Appellations  All these  Tribes  tho' wholly  Subject  to one  Common  Go∣vernment avoid confounding  Kindred  by a  Marriage  into one anothers  Fa∣milies  a  Nicety  which never was observ'd but by the  Jews  and  now  these  Tartars thence  with Probability suppo'd their  Offspring  The Language of the  Tartars  THE Language of the  Tartars  is so very reconcilable to  Hebrew  that the Difference there is between them may be very well accounted for when we consider they were mix'd  so long  with their Rough Conquerors the  Syrians  e're they found a Possibility to make a  General Revolt  and the pro∣digious Ignorance and strange Barbarity a Nation for so many Ages void of  Arts  and  Sciences  or the Improvements of Humanity by  Trade  or  Conver∣sation  with a more Polite and Knowing People must  of Course  degenerate to  A Tradition of the  Tartars  ANOTHER Thing which serves to prove the just  Validity  of this  Opinion  is that all the  Tartars  do not only  Circumcise  and  Ʋse  the ancient  Jewish Rights  in almost every Point of  Worship  but Traditionally boast themselves to be Descended from those  Israelites  who Conquering  their  Conquerors became Possess'd of all the  Territories  by the  Caspian Sea  and  hence  it was that  Tamerlain  or rather  Tamherlane the Great  who led the  Turkish Bajazet  about his City in an  Iron Cage  wou'd often take occasion to be  Vaunting  of his  Pedigree  affirming he was  Lineally  De∣scended from the  Tribe  of  Dan  in an uninterrupted  Genealogy  The two Infe∣rences to be drawn from the foregoing Arguments  FROM the abovenam'd Observations it appears but  rational  to draw two  Inferences First  That the Great Founders of the Present  Turkish Em∣pire  are Descended from the  Tartar's Race  and  Secondly  that those distin∣guish'd  now  by the said Name of  Tartars  are the  Ten Transplanted Tribes of Israel  so justly Punish'd by  Almighty God  for their  Offensive Obstinacy  that from the most  Esteem'd  and  Glorious Nation  of the  Ʋniverse  they are Degene∣rated into the most Despicable  Outcasts  of Unbless'd  Humanity  CHAP LI Instructions to the  Traveller  who wou'd make a  Safe  and  Profitable Journey  into the  Eastern Coun∣tries  The Design of this Chap∣ter  THE Generous Reader will I doubt not put a  right  Interpreta∣tion on my  Meaning  in pretending to instruct the  World  when  I my self  as much as  other People  want Instruction All I aim at by the Subject I am now about to take upon me is to lay down  Rules  which I have prov'd by  oft Repeated  tho' but  young  Experience to be safe and necessary to the Practice of that  Traveller  who wou'd to  any Pur∣pose  spend his Time in Foreign Countries  Education of Youth the Glory of a Nation  THE Infinite  Advantages  the  Honour Glory Riches  and  Prosperity  accruing to a Nation by the careful Training up the  Youth  she shines with and the great Necessity of  sowing  wisely all those  Seeds  of  Liberal Education  which they hope to see  securely  Flourish in a full  Maturity  are so Conspicu∣ous to Mankind and Universally allow'd of that I need enlarge no more on so  Incontrovertible  an Argument  The Advan∣tages of Travel  IF then the Care of  Youth  be commonly allow'd a  Duty  weightily In∣cumbent on a  Common Wealth  'twill easily appear a certain Truth both from the Practice of the Ancient and the Modern  Times  that sending them to Travel into Foreign Parts has ever been esteem'd and doubtless is the greatest  Blessing  and most sure  Improvement  we can lead their Minds to since they Learn thereby to study  Men  instead of  Books  and by a Free and Generous Conversation with the  open World  not only shake off their Do∣mestick Dregs of  Bashfulness  and  Ignorance  but wholesomely digesting the Remembred Dictates of their  late Minority  become  Polite  in the Deport∣ment of their  Persons  and Refin'd extreamly in the Notions of their  Judg∣ment  The Folly of neglecting it  HENCE it follows that as 'tis undoubtedly the greatest  Policy  as well as  Honour  of a Prudent People to encourage  Youth  to  Early Travel  'tis an unhappy  Flaw  in any Nations  Character  to have it said they stand  Insensible  of  Evident Advantages  and rather  stifle  than  promote  a Practice so Commendable  Englishmen  Remiss in its Encourage∣ment  I must confess I have with no small Wonder taken notice that my Countrymen of all the  Europaean Nations  are the most  Remiss  in this  Af∣fair  We see them commonly but thinly sown in  Foreign Courts Camps Schools  or  Academies  while Numbers of the Natives of all other  Christian  Countries flock continually to every  Land  or  City  Famous in the least be∣yond  their Neighbours  An Observa∣tion on the  NorthBritons  I ought not to  omit  since I have here so fair an Opportunity the do∣ing  Justice  to our  LateƲnited Gallant Brothers of  NORTHBRITAIN who are so effectually Sensible of the Advantages abovenam'd that their  Gentle∣men  are commonly the  Best Bred  and  most Learn'd  of  Christendom  and do not only Travel  much  but to  much Purpose also  for we seldom see a Celebrated  Court  of  Europe  but the  Civil  sometimes sometimes  Military  Offices thereof are not alone  Possess'd  but  Ornamented  greatly by the  Natives  of that  Coun∣try  Travelling now more in Fashion  HOWEVER I may spare the Pains of  Searching  for the  Causes  of so Groundless a Neglect since there appears a Brisker  Turn  than  Formerly  to animate the  Genius  of the  English Nation  who within some  few Years past  have seem'd to seek more earnestly than  heretofore  the  Benefits of Travel∣ling  I will therefore only  wish  for the  Improvement  of a Custom so  PraiseWor∣thy  and proceed to give the  Hints  I promis'd in relation to the  Methods  they shou'd  Ʋse  in  Travelling  At what Age Young Men shou'd Travel  I am not for the speedy sending  Youth  abroad before their  Judgment  is  Mature  enough to give them a distinguishing  Idea  of the  Ʋse  as well as  Prospect  of the Things they meet with Eighteen Years of  Age  is more too  Early  than too  Late  for a  Young Man  to think of leaving  England  This I know by  Personal Experience  having been beholding to my  Latter Travels  for a Full  Digestion  and  Improvement  of the Unripe  Observations  vainly ga∣ther'd in my  Former  An Error common in the  English  Practice  IT is a Fault  too Common  in our  Modern Practice  to send  Young Men  Abroad to see the Rarities of  Italy  and  other Countries  before they are at all acquainted with  Domestick Curiosities  and Things as well deserving Obser∣vation in the  Heart  of  our own Kingdom  as he possibly can meet with in the  Places  he must Travel thro'  Its Follies  BESIDES it is a kind of unaccountable  Simplicity  to think a Man is  Qualified  for  Conversation  in a Foreign Land before he Understands or has the smallest  Notion  of the  Government  or any  Part  of the  Whole Constitution  or  Condition  of his Native Country For  such  an Ignorance must necessarily render him unfit for an  Inquisitive  or  Learn'd  Society in any Place he comes to and consequently  hinder  him of all  Advantages  he might have  Reap'd  from the  Improvements  of his  Journey  Another Error  ANOTHER  Error  and no  small one  is that most  Young Men  are sent  Abroad  entirely Ignorant of  German Dutch Italian  and too often  French  or any  Foreign Languages  This renders them  depriv'd  of even a  Possibility  of  Living  as they  ought  in  Friendship  and  Acquaintance  with their  Equals  or  Superiors  where they come for 'tis but seldom any  Tongue  but  French  is thought worth bringing  Home  or if some  Few  have  Souls  and  Memory  enough to Compass more by that time they have learn'd to speak them tolerably the short  Space  allotted for their  Absence  is expir'd and they must return to put an End to their  Vain Journey  just as they are grown  Capacitated  to improve themselves by its  Advantages  A third Error  THERE are a kind of  Gentlemen  call'd  Tutors  generally sent  Abroad  with a Commission to  Direct  and  Govern  their  Young Travellers  These are sometimes  Frenchmen  sometimes  Englishmen  but always of an  Age  by far  Superior  and an  Humour  often  Opposite  to  those  they have the  Charge of  Proper to be Reform'd  THIS I think an  Error  that shou'd be Reform'd for many  Reasons  If the  Tutor  be a  Foreigner  I need not Nominate the many Disadvantages the  Pupil  must be Subject to and if an  Englishman  of such  Superior Age  as commonly they are I humbly ask my Reader's leave to say  a Word or two  on that Occasion  The Reasons for Reforming it  YOUNG MEN are naturally Prepossess'd with a Dislike or Timo∣rous Apprehension of  such Men  as are appointed for their  Governors  They are their second  Schoolmasters  and consequently look'd upon as  Objects  of their  Spleen  They are imagin'd  Spies  o'er all their  Actions  and  Informers  of their  Juvenile Extravagancies  Their  Best  Advice is  Coldly  list'ned to for want of an  Affection  and their  Precepts rob'd  of proper  Force  because not back'd by  Open Familiarity  More Reasons  AGAIN 'tis natural for  Young Men  to reflect  What is this Man who Curbs our Inclinations Why a Tutor that is one whose Business is to call those Pleasures Faults which he has now perhaps outliv'd the Tast of He forgets the Inclinations of his Youth and wou'd oblige us to a Life as Melancholy as his own in spite of all the Disproportion that appears betwixt our Ages  But were any of the  Arguments  he  us'd  made strong by both the  Precept  and  Example  of some  Wise Companion  not much Older than  Himself  they wou'd undoubted∣ly prevail on his  Belief  because he cannot look upon them the  Effects  of Pee∣vish Age or Want of Relish but occasion'd  purely  by a Wise Restraint of Headstrong  Passions  and a Swing of  Vanity  AS I have Censur'd those Three  Common Errors  in our  Practice  just afore∣nam'd so I will  as Briefly as is Possible  set down the  Rules  by which we may with ease avoid their Inconveniencies  How the first Error might be mended  AND First I wou'd advise that  Children  shou'd be put to  School  so ear∣ly that they may have gain'd a Competent Increase of  Ʋnderstanding  in a  Residence  at either of the  Ʋniversities  by that time they have reach'd the  Age  of Eighteen Years at farthest  THEN it might be Proper that in some  Relation  's Care he might Reside at  London  one whole Winter there to Learn the  Fashionable Gayeties  which recommend a Gentleman for  Breeding  and  Appearance  A necessary Improvement  IN the  Summer  following 'twou'd be a great  Improvement  to his  Know∣ledge  if assisted by the  Recommendatory  Letters of his Friends to their Ac∣quaintance in the Country he shou'd undertake a  Journey  quite thro'  En∣gland Wales  and Part of if not all  North Britain  How to be    BUT he shou'd not only  Travel  thro' these  Countries  but  from Place to Place  be Recommended to the  House  and  Care  of some Considerable Man of  Parts  and  Fortune  who shou'd not alone contrive to Entertain him  Hospi∣tably  but be sure to Introduce him to the Knowledge and Acquaintance of the  Best  and  Wisest Part  of all his  Neighbourhood  by whose Assistance and So∣ciety he might not only be  Diverted  with a Sight of every  Curiosity  but  Taught  at large the  Charters  and  Antiquity  of every  Corporation Privileges Laws  and  Customs  of each County  Honour  and  Descent  of every  Family  and all Things else that might be fansy'd requisite to give him an entire  Idea  of the Nature and Condition of the  Government  he is Sub∣ject to  BY these means he is hardned for the  Accidental Dangers  and  Fatigues  he probably may meet with in his longer  Journey  and enabled when he is  Abroad  to give a  Foreigner  an  Answer  to a  Question  full as easily as ask one of him  A Second Er∣ror how Cu∣rable  SECONDLY in order to prevent the Inconveniencies arising from a want of Knowledge in the  European  Languages I wou'd advise all Gen∣tlemen who think of Travelling to Qualifie themselves for true Improve∣ment by some few Years  Previous Interwoven  Application to the Study of the  French Italian Dutch  and  German  Languages which they may learn with ease at  several times  by  several Masters  or by  one  while at their  Latin  School or either  Ʋniversity  Then having made themselves indifferent  Proficients  they may in their Six Months Continuance at  London  after∣wards improve them to a fuller Height by keeping Company as much as possible with  Foreign Gentlemen  who Travel Yearly into  England  and wou'd be glad of their Society  The Advan∣tages of Lan∣guage  THUS wou'd they go  Abroad  sufficiently enabled to Converse Fami∣liarly in Foreign Countries as they did at  Home  and thence avoiding that too common  Shyness  us'd to  Strangers  they wou'd soon gain  Friends  and pleas'd with their Acquaintance swell their Knowledge to as high a Pitch  Abroad  as they had done at  Home  by former  Application  An Observa∣tion concer∣ning Tutors  THIRDLY not to Rob the  Gentlemen  who in the Character of  Tutors  take upon them the  no little Charge  of Educating  Youth  of those accomplish'd  Merits  some of them are Masters of I wou'd offer to the se∣rious Consideration of  my Countrymen  whether 'twou'd not be a Method more Conducive to the good Improvement of a Young Man's Time to send  Abroad  as his Companion some  Young Gentleman  of Unquestionable Conduct not much  Older  than himself but one who has by Publick Busi∣ness or his Former Travels render'd his Experience  riper  than his  Years  might speak it  How justi∣fy'd  HERE Persuasion and Example wou'd undoubtedly be far more  efficacious  than the  Precepts  of Authority The Arguments which might be us'd to win him from a  Folly  wou'd appear no otherwise than Friend∣ly Wishes for his  Welfare  The Familiar Conversation they wou'd have  to∣gether  must afford a Thousand Pretty Opportunities to Censure the Miscar∣riages he may have made with a Brisk  Air  of Unsuspected  Gayety  The only Bar no great one  IN short the only  Bar  to the Advantages which must accrue from such a  Practice  is the mighty Difficulty that must certainly attend the  Choice  of such a Man as may in every Point appear well Qualified for the Discharge of such a  Trust  as must be given him And  this  how difficult soever it may seem will prove an easier Task upon Examination than  most  Men imagine it and doubtless wou'd be easier  yet  if once the In∣troduction of so good a  Custom  gave Encouragement for Men of Worth to Qualifie themselves for that  Employment  Which Parts are best to Travel first to  WHEN thus prepar'd for  Foreign Travel  the  Young Gentleman  wou'd do a Prudent Action to consider what Part of the Universe he may with most Improvement bend his Journey to and certainly in my Opinion 'twou'd be best to Visit  first  the  East  or  SouthEast  World for there he will not only  view  a Scene of Nature wholly contrary to his  own  Country in  Religion Humour Government  and every Means and Form of  Living  which he cannot well be said to meet in  Europe  but will learn to  Contem∣plate  by frequent  Views  of the prodigious Changes  Time  has made in Towns and Kingdoms on the Miserable Instability of  Worldly Grandeur  which together with the  Ʋnpolite  and  Rustic Treatment  he must doubtless meet with from the Proud Inhabitants of those  SelfLoving  Countries will depress or curb at least the Headstrong Sallies of Impetuous  Youth  and Native Arrogance of  Temper  so that afterwards returning by the  way  of  Italy  and  France  and  other  the Politest  European  Nations he may stand  secure against the strong Temptations of those  Fashionable Vanities  which mix themselves unluckily with the respective  Excellencies  every  Court  is judg'd most Famous for  A Great Ne∣glect Re∣prov'd  AGAIN I look upon it as a mighty  Error  in the  British Travellers  so strangely to neglect the Knowledge of  Marine  Affairs unless their  Educati∣on  or Pursuit of their  Preferment  calls them to their Practice Nothing cer∣tainly can add a Brighter  Ornament  to any  Englishman  's Capacity than to be fully Vers'd at least made tolerably Knowing in the Mysteries of  Na∣vigation  and the many  useful  Sciences and  profitable  Observations which a  few  short Voyages will  gild  his Understanding with Considerable Noti∣ons of  Travelling by Sea Re∣commended  I wou'd therefore willingly advise all  Gentlemen  who travel to Embark on Board some Trading  Vessel  if in time of Peace bound up the  Straits  from Port to Port on either side or if the speed  one  Vessel makes may call him from a  Place  before he has had time to make his  Observations  he will constantly be  sure  to meet  some Ship  or  other  Bound directly to the  Port  he has a mind to be Transported to no matter whether she be  Eng∣lish  or of any other  Christian  Nation for the more  Variety  he meets with in his Travels so much more Extensive will become his  Experience  The Course he shou'd Steer  BY these Means he may at his own leisure see the Kingdoms of  Spain Portugal  and  Sicily  The SeaPort Towns of  Fez Morocco Tripoly Algiers  and other Parts of  Barbary  the numerous Islands of the  Graecian Archipelago  with the Rich  Emporiums  of the  Turkish  Empire  Smyrna  and  Constanti∣nople  A Further Journey  HENCE he may proceed  by Land and Sea  as he imagines most Convenient and Diverting on to  Egypt  and the  Holy Land  and  thence  from Place to Place with  Yearly Caravans  or  Monthly ones  till he has satisfied his  utmost Curiosity  with a distinct and serious View of all the  several Bran∣ches  of that  Mighty Monarchy  The  Tour  con∣tinued and ended two se∣veral ways  THIS done he may return from any  SeaPort  Town of  Turkey  by the way of  Italy  for Ships are constantly Bound thence to  Venice  or  Leg∣horn  But as some Inconveniencies such as  Performing Quarantana  and the like attend that  Voyage  'twou'd be more Improving and Delightful to a  Genius  Temper'd with the smallest  Curiosity  to Travel over Land thro'  Turkey  into  Italy  by the  Road  of  Philippopolis  and so to  Venice  or into  Ger∣many  by passing thro'  Romania Bulgaria Valachia Transilvania  and  Hun∣gary  to the City of  Vienna either  of which Roads admitting you to a considerable Part of  Christendom  lies easy and convenient to  point  you out a  Tour  thro' all the Noted  Courts  of  Europe  after which you will return to  England  like an  Indian Vessel  whose inestimable  Freight  makes full amends for the  Fatigues  and Dangers of a Tedious  Absence  NOW that all these  Schemes  of  Travel  may be undertaken and per∣form'd with as much Safety and Advantage as is  possible  I beg the Rea∣der's Patience while I give a  word or two  of Necessary Caution which will bring me on to a  Conclusion  of the  Chapter  Another Great Ne∣glect  THERE is not a  Neglect  more Common nor of a more Fatal Con∣sequence  now  suffer'd than the sending  Gentlemen  Abroad without a fur∣ther Charge of  Letters  than such only as are  necessary  to procure Supplies of  Money  when their  Exigencies  may require it  The Use of Recommen∣datory Let∣ters  HE ought to carry  Recommendatory Letters  for each  Noted Place  he thinks of going to Nor are those  Letters  worthy of  that Name  which commonly are sent by Merchants to their Correspondents in a  Foreign Part  wherein the  Gentleman  who  bears  them is in Fashionable Words of Course so Coldly Recommended that a Formal Visit or a Drunken Entertainment is the most he meets with from the  Persons  he is address'd to  The Care to be us'd in that Point  ALL Gentlemen who send their  Sons  or  Friends  Abroad shou'd be ex∣treamly  nice  in this  Particular  For 'tis according to the Interests or Incli∣nations of the People to whom  Travellers  are  Recommended  that their Jour∣ney turns to  Good  or  Ill Account however Great  may be their  Quality  or  Long  their  Absence  The Inconve∣niencies of going Abroad without them  IF they are not recommended to some Gentlemen of  Interest  in the Countries they pass thro' they can do no more in any Town they come to than Walk up and down the Streets see now and then a  Monastery  or perhaps Peep thro' the  Grates  of some  Close Nunnery  stare aukwardly upon the Outsides of  Great Buildings  and return to  England  after two or three Years Absence just as Wise in  Foreign  Matters as when they departed from it  A Fault pe∣culiar to  En∣glishMen  Abroad  AND here I cannot help Complaining of a Fault peculiar to the  En∣glish  Gentlemen Abroad and call'd by  Foreigners  an  Ʋnbred Pride  and  Haughtiness  of  Temper  tho' 'tis rather owing to their want of  Recommenda∣tory Letters  well Directed It is a kind of Separation or Distinction which they make between Themselves and the Inhabitants of any Town they chance to stay at earnestly desiring  English Company  and seeming as it were averse to any other which entirely  Robs  them of the smallest  Possibili∣ty  of making an Improvement by their  Travels  or  Expences  The Best Re∣commendato∣ry Letters  THE only way is to make Interest with the  Foreign Ministers Ambas∣sadors  or  Envoys  who reside at  London  and have doubtless not alone a vast Acquaintance but considerable Power with the Best and most Capa∣citated Gentlemen of their own  Country  and the Tenour of their  Letters  shou'd require their Favour Friendship and Good Offices in every kind to the Young Traveller who carries them but more especially  Sollicit  their Assistance and Directions in the Observations most deserving a  Remark  and their Advice what  Towns  or  Places  in the Country may be worth  Re∣gard  with the Additional Civility of  Letters  of Recommendation which may  urge  their Friends in any Parts to do as  they  have done by the depar∣ting  Traveller  Another ne∣cessary Cau∣tion  ANOTHER kind of  Letters  they shou'd never go without are those directed to our own  Ambassadors  or other  Publick Ministers  residing in the  Courts  of  Foreign Princes  and a due Respect shou'd constantly be paid them on your first Arrival These  Advices  well observ'd may I have reason to believe  at least  I wish they might conduce a little to my  Coun∣tryMens  Advantage who design to  Travel  But as I have thoughts of Pub∣lishing hereafter by its self a  Regular Treatise  on this Subject I will now conclude with an Assurance to my Reader that  Experience  has convinc'd me of the  Truth  of what I Write or I had scarce presum'd to Recommend  my  Sentiments on this Occasion  CHAP LII The  CONCLUSION  AND  now  I have  as well as I am able  play'd the Part of a  Sincere Relater  of the Observations made in  Foreign Countries  and com∣mit my  Book  to the  IllNature  of the  Criticks  with a Scorn of all their  little Malice  and a hearty Wish that such as  read  with a Desire to be  Diverted  or  Inform'd  may find therein as full a  Satisfaction  as I shou'd receive in hearing that they did so  The Malice of the Times  THE  Fashionable Envy  of these Peevish Times permits  no Author  to be  overproud  of his  Best Labours  And were I  less Modest  than I think my self which wou'd  I'm sure  be very far from any thing like  Vanity  The  Age  I live in wou'd no doubt find Means to mortify all  Selfesteem  and were a  Book  to be expos'd to  Publick Censure  as deserving  Praise  as those of  Ho∣race  or the  Roman Ovid  The IllNa¦ture of Cri∣ticks  Softmouth'd  Criticks  wou'd be nibling at the  Bait  and run the hazard of  breaking out their Teeth  far rather than not strive to make some ill  Impression  on it which if after all they fail to do they'll  drivel  out their  Rage  and  spit  upon it  harmlesly  in  meer Vexation  WERE there a  Modern Ovid now  alive accomplish'd like the  Antient  he'd be look'd upon a very  Monster  of  VainGlory  shou'd he Crown his  La∣bours  with a  Selfwreath'd Gaerland  and conclude his Works as  Magisterially  as  once  the  former  did in these  Highsounding Verses  Ovid  Met Lib ult  Jamque opus exegi quod nec  Jovis Ira  nec  Ignis  Nec poterit  Ferrum  neque Edax abolère vetustas  And  now  an  End  to that  vast Work  is giv'n  Which neither  Fire  nor the  Illwill  of  Heav'n  Nor the  Keen Rage  which does the Sword employ  Nor  Time  's  devouring Rust  shall e'er  destroy  The Author's Resignation  SINCE therefore  Truth  not  Merit  can successfully lay claim to  just Applause  in this ungrateful  Age  I who can only boast the  former Virtue  will proceed more  humbly  and submit my  Labours  to the Sentence of the  World  with all the Resignation of a  Man  who having nobler  Ends  in  Wri∣ting  than to  Flatter Faction  or  expect Reward  has no occasion to be much solicitous for the Success of his  Endeavours  A Word or two concer¦ning the Pro∣bable Down∣fal of the  Turks  I'LL only add a Word or Two concerning a  Conspicuous Probability  of the  approaching Downfal  of the  Turkish Empire  which has grown by gra∣dual  Acquisitions  to a most amazing  Bulk  and  Constitution  but at  present  seems so weaken'd by the  Natural Corruption  and  Infirmities  of  Age  that Terrible Convulsions shake its Frame as if 'twere hastning onwards to∣wards a  sudden Period  Expected from the  Mus∣covites  I have elsewhere in this Book occasionally taken Notice of a  Prophecy  in vogue among the  Turks  That  They shall be destroy'd by a Longwhitehair'd Northern Nation of the Christian World  and that they look upon the  Musco∣vites  to be the  Nation  hinted in the  Prophecy  on which Account they seem extreamly Apprehensive of the  Motions  of that  People  and their  Fright  is aggravated greatly by the means the  Muscovites  have lately found of sen∣ding  Ships of War  thro' the  Black Sea  to  Constantinople  and the  Ʋniversal Disposition  of the  Greeks  to look upon  that Nation  as their  longdecreed Delive∣rers  The Policy of the  Czar  in his War with  Sweden  IF Heaven has Ordain'd it to be so 'tis probable it may be suddenly  Effected  for the  Warlike Disposition  of the Present  Czar  beyond his  Ancestors  and the  Degeneracy  of the  Modern  from the  Antient Turks  are  Weighty Cir∣cumstances  The  Victorious King of Sweden  has been nothing worse than a  Severe SchoolMaster  to the  Muscovites  who owe an  admirable Discipline  to the  War  they're  now  engag'd in and reserve those  Troops  made  Soldiers  by a  Year or two's Fatigue  in Inland Garrisons to Exercise their Fellows and Im∣prove themselves while  Raw  and  NewRais'd Men  are sent each Year to  face their Enemies  till they become  Good Warriors  and give way to more  Fresh Comers  The Reasons guess'd  IN my Opinion these Proceedings wear the  Air  of some  Welllaid Design  and the  Fatigue  the  Present Monarch  of the  Muscovite Dominions  has been at in  tedious Travels  The uncredited  Improvement  he has made throughout his  Country  chiefly in Marine Affairs The Great Encouragement he gives all  Foreign Officers  and  Arts  he uses to  allure  them to his  Service  All these seem to speak a further  End  than the  Repulsing  a  Weak Swedish Enemy  The Possibili∣ty of his Con∣quering the  Turks  'TIS my Belief he'll fall upon the  Turks  as soon as the Maturity of his  Designs  affords him Opportunity Nor do I question but  by God's Assi∣stance  with the Great Advantages he will have over them he may entire∣ly  Overthrow  their  Government  and in their  Ruin  gloriously  Revenge  the  Bloody Falls  of those  Brave Christian Princes  who have  sunk  from Age to Age beneath the Weight of their  Oppressive Ʋsurpation  But the  Nature  of my  Book  and  little space  I have to  spare  forbid me to enlarge on this  Particular  which if I have  foreseen  with  Judgment Heaven  direct to  triumph  in  Prospe∣rity  for the  Great Good  of  ƲNIVERSAL CHRISTENDOM  FINIS
