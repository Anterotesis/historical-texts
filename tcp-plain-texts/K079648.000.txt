 THREE ESSAYS ON PICTURESQUE BEAUTY ON PICTURESQUE TRAVEL AND ON SKETCHING LANDSCAPE TO WHICH IS ADDED A POEM ON LANDSCAPE PAINTING  BY WILLIAM GILPIN M A PREBENDARY OF SALISBURY AND VICAR OF BOLDRE IN NEW FOREST NEAR LYMINGTON  London  PRINTED FOR R BLAMIRE IN THE STRAND  MDCCXCII  TO WILLIAM LOCK  ESQ  OF  NORBURYPARK  in  SURREY  DEAR SIR  THE following essays and poem I beg leave to inscribe to you Indeed I do little more than return your own for the best remarks and observations in them are yours Such as may be cavilled at I am persuaded must be mine  A published work is certainly a fair object of criticism but I think my dear sir we picturesque people are a little misunderstood with regard to our  general intention  I have  several times been surprized at finding us represented as supposing  all beauty  to consist in  picturesque beauty  and the face of nature to be examined  only by the rules of painting  Whereas in fact we always speak a different language We speak of the grand scenes of nature tho uninteresting in a  picturesque light  as having a strong effect on the imagination often a stronger than when they are pro∣perly disposed for the pencil We every where make a distinction between scenes that are  beautiful  and  amusing  and scenes that are  picturesque  We examine and admire both Even artificial objects we admire whether in a grand or in a humble stile tho unconnected with picturesque beautythe palace and the cottagethe improved gardenscene and the neat homestall Works of tillage also afford us equal delightthe plough the mower the reaper the hayfield and the harvestwane In a word we reverence and admire the works of God and look with benevolence and pleasure on the works of men  In what then do we offend At the expence of no other species of beauty we merely en∣deavour to illustrate and recommend  one  species more which tho among the most interesting hath never yet so far as I know been made the set object of investigation From scenes indeed of the  picturesque kind  we exclude the appendages of tillage and in general the works of men which too often introduce preciseness and formality But ex∣cluding artificial objects from one species of beauty is not degrading them from all We leave then the general admirer of the beauties of nature to his own pursuits nay we admire them with him all we desire is that he would leave us as quietly in the possession of our amusements  Under this apology my dear sir I have ventured in the following essays to inlarge a little both on our theory and practice In the first essay that we may be fairly under∣stood the  distinguishing characteristic  is marked  of  such beautiful objects  as are suited to the pencil In the second the mode of amuse∣ment is pointed out that may arise from viewing the scenes of nature in a picturesque light and in the third a few rules are given for sketching landscape after nature I have practised drawing as an amusement and re∣laxation for many years and here offer the result of my experience Some readiness in  execution  indeed it is supposed is necessary before these rules can be of much service They mean to take the young artist up where the drawingmaster leaves himI have only to add farther that as several of the rules and principles here laid down have been touched in different picturesque works which I have given the public I have endeavoured not to repeat myself and where I could not throw new light on a subject I have hastened over itonly in a work of this kind it was ne∣cessary to bring all my principles together  With regard to the poem annexed to these essays something more should be said As that small part of the public who personally know me and that still smaller part whom I have the honour to call my friends may think me guilty of presumption in attempting a work of this kind I beg leave to give the following history of it  Several years ago I amused myself with writing a few lines in verse on landscapepainting and afterwards sent them as a frag∣ment for they were not finished to amuse a friend  Edward Forster  esq  of Walthamstow  I had no other purpose My friend told me he could not say much for my  poetry  but as my  rules  he thought were good he wished me to finish my frag∣ment and if I should not like it as a  poem  I might turn it into an  essay in prose  As this was only what I expected I was not disap∣pointed tho not encouraged to proceed So  I troubled my head no farther with my verses  Some time after another friend  Rev Mr Mason  finding fault with my mode of describing the lakes and mountains of Cumberland and Westmore∣land as too poetical I told him the fate of my fragment lamenting the hardship of my casewhen I wrote verse one friend called it prose and when I wrote prose another friend called it verse In his next letter he desired to see my verses and being pleased with the subject he offered if I would finish my poem however carelessly as to metrical exactness he would adjust the versification But he found he had engaged in a more arduous affair than he expected My rules and tecnical terms were stubborn and would not easily glide into verse and I was as stub∣born as they and would not relinquish the scientific part for the poetry My friend's  goodnature therefore generally gave way and suffered many lines to stand and many altera∣tions to be made which his own good taste could not approve  Extract of a letter from Mr Mason  I have inserted conscientiously every word and phrase you have altered except the awkward word  clump  which I have uniformly discarded whenever it offered itself to me in my English garden which you may imagine it did frequently in it's stead I have always used  tuft  I have ventured therefore to insert it adjectively and I hope I shall be forgiven Except in this single instance I know not that I have deviated in the least from the alterations you sentI now quit all that relates to the poem not without some selfsatisfaction in thinking it is over for to own the truth had I thought you would have expected such almost mathematical  exactitude of terms  as I find you do and in consequence turned lines tolerably poetical into prosaic for the sake of precision I should never have ventured to give you my assistance  I am afraid therefore I must appear to the world as having spoiled a good poem and must shelter myself and it under those learned reasons which have been given for putting  Propria quae maribus  and  As in praesenti  into verse If the rules have injured the poetry as  rules  at least I  hope they will meet your approbation I am dear sir with the greatest esteem and regard  Your sincere and most obedient humble servant WILLIAM GILPIN  Vicar'shill  Oct    EXPLANATION OF THE  PRINTS  TWO facing page It is the intention of these two prints to illustrate how very adverse the idea of  smoothness  is to the  composition  of landscape In the second of them the  great lines  of the landscape are exactly the same as in the first only they are  more broken  Two facing p The first of these prints is meant to illustrate the idea of  simple illumi∣nation  The light falls strongly on  various  parts as indeed it often does in nature But as it is the painter's business to take nature in her most beautiful form he chuses to throw his light more into a  mass  as re∣presented in the second print which exhi∣bits the  same landscape  only better inlight∣ened When we merely take the  lines  of a landscape from nature and  inlighten  it  as we must often do from our own taste and judgment the massing of the light must be well attended to as one of the great sources of beauty It must not be scattered in spots but must be brought more together as on the rocky side of the hill in the second print and yet it must graduate also in different parts so as not to appear affected  One print facing p The idea of  gradation  is here farther illustrated according to the explanation in p The inscription is that admired one of Caecilia Metella the daughter of Metellus and the wife of Crassus in which with so much elegant and tender simplicity her name is divided between her father and her husband  One facing p This print exemplifies a  simple mode  of  tinting  a drawing as explained in the text The colouring of this print which is done by hand has added a little to the expence of the book but it was thought necessary to compleat the scheme It was coloured by a relation of mine Mr Gilpin drawingmaster at Paddingtongreen who in all the copies I have seen has illustrated my ideas very satisfactorily and who as far as the recommendation of a partial kinsman may go deserves mine  One facing p This print is an explanation of a few rules in perspective just sufficient for the use of common landscape  ESSAY I ON PICTURESQUE BEAUTY  ESSAY I  DISPUTES about beauty might perhaps be involved in less confusion if a distinction were established which certainly exists between such objects as are  beautiful  and such as are  picturesque  between those which please the eye in their  natural state  and those which please from some quality capable of being  illustrated in painting  Ideas of beauty vary with the object and with the eye of the spectator Those arti∣ficial forms appear generally the most beau∣tiful with which we have been the most conversant Thus the stonemason sees beau∣ties in a welljointed wall which escape the architect who surveys the building under a different idea And thus the painter who  compares his object with the rules of his art sees it in a different light from the man of general taste who surveys it only as simply beautiful  As this difference therefore between the  beau∣tiful  and the  picturesque  appears really to exist and must depend on some peculiar construction of the object it may be worth while to ex∣amine what that peculiar construction is We inquire not into the  general sources of beauty  either in nature or in representation This would lead into a nice and scientific discussion in which it is not our purpose to engage The question simply is  What is that quality in objects which particularly marks them as picturesque  In examining the  real object  we shall find one source of beauty arises from that species of elegance which we call  smoothness  or  neatness  for the terms are nearly synonymous The higher the marble is polished the brighter the silver is rubbed and the more the maho∣gany shines the more each is considered as an object of beauty as if the eye delighted in gliding smoothly over a surface  In the class of larger objects the same idea prevails In a pile of building we wish to  see neatness in every part added to the elegance of the architecture And if we examine a piece of improved pleasureground every thing rough and slovenly offends  Mr Burke enumerating the properties of beauty considers  smoothness  as one of the most essential "A very considerable part of the effect of beauty says he is owing to this quality indeed the most considerable for take any beautiful object and give it a broken and rugged surface and however wellformed it may be in other respects it pleases no longer Whereas let it want ever so many of the other constituents if it want not this it becomes more pleasing than almost all the others without it"  Upon the sublime and beautiful p  How far Mr Burke may be right in making smoothness the  most considerable  source of beauty I rather doubt  Mr Burke is probably not very accurate in what he farther says on the connection between  beauty  and  diminutives  Beauty excites love and a loved object is generally characterized by diminutives But it does not follow that all objects characterized by diminutives tho they may be so  because they are loved are therefore beautiful We often love them for their moral qualities their affections their gentleness or their docility Beauty no doubt awakens love but it also excites admiration and respect This com∣bination forms the sentiment which prevails when we look at the Apollo of Belvidere and the Niobe No man of nice discernment would characterize these statues by diminu∣tives There is then a beauty between which and dimi∣nutives there is no relation but which on the contrary excludes them and in the description of figures possessed of that species of beauty we seek for terms which recommend them more to our  admiration  than our  love  A considerable one it cer∣tainly is  Thus then we suppose the matter stands with regard to  beautiful objects in general  But in  picturesque representation  it seems somewhat odd yet we shall perhaps find it equally true that the reverse of this is the case and that the ideas of  neat  and  smooth  instead of being picturesque in fact disqualify the object in which they reside from any pre∣tensions to  picturesque beauty  Nay farther we do not scruple to assert that  roughness  forms the most essential point of difference between the  beautiful  and the  picturesque  as it seems to be that particular quality which makes objects chiefly pleasing in paint∣ingI use the general term  roughness  but properly speaking roughness relates only to  the surfaces of bodies when we speak of their delineation we use the word  ruggedness  Both ideas however equally enter into the picturesque and both are observable in the smaller as well as in the larger parts of naturein the outline and bark of a tree as in the rude summit and craggy sides of a mountain  Let us then examine our theory by an ap∣peal to experience and try how far these qualities enter into the idea of  picturesque beauty  and how far they mark that dif∣ference among objects which is the ground of our inquiry  A piece of Palladian architecture may be elegant in the last degree The proportion of it's partsthe propriety of it's ornamentsand the symmetry of the whole may be highly plea∣sing But if we introduce it in a picture it immediately becomes a formal object and ceases to please Should we wish to give it picturesque beauty we must use the mallet instead of the chissel we must beat down one half of it deface the other and throw the mutilated members around in heaps In short from a  smooth  building we must turn it into a  rough  ruin No painter who had the choice of the two objects would hesitate a moment  Again why does an elegant piece of gardenground make no figure on canvas The shape is pleasing the combination of the objects harmonious and the winding of the walk in the very line of beauty All this is true but the  smoothness  of the whole tho right and as it should be in nature offends in picture Turn the lawn into a piece of broken ground plant rugged oaks instead of flowering shrubs break the edges of the walk give it the rude∣ness of a road mark it with wheeltracks and scatter around a few stones and brushwood in a word instead of making the whole  smooth  make it  rough  and you make it also  picturesque  All the other ingredients of beauty it already possessed  You sit for your picture The master at your desire paints your head combed smooth and powdered from the barber's hand This may give it a more striking likeness as it is more the resemblance of the real object But is it therefore a more pleasing picture I fear not Leave Reynolds to himself and he will make it picturesque he will throw the hair dishevelled about your shoulders Virgil would  have done the same It was his usual practice in all his portraits In his figure of Ascanius we have the  fusos crines  and in his portrait of Venus which is highly finished in every part the artist has given her hair  diffundere ventis  The roughness which Virgil gives the hair of Venus and Ascanius we may suppose to be of a different kind from the squalid roughness which he attributes to Charon  Portitor has horrendus aquas et flumina servat  Terribili squalore Charon cui plurima mento  Canities inculta jacet  Charon's roughness is in it's kind picturesque also but the roughness here intended and which can only be introduced in elegant figures is of that kind which is merely opposed to hair in nice order In describing Venus Virgil probably thought hair when  streaming in the wind  both beautiful and picturesque from it's undulating form and varied tints and from a kind of life which it assumes in motion tho perhaps it's chief recommendation to him at the moment was that it was a feature of the character which Venus was then assuming  That lovely face of youth smiling with all it's sweet dimpling charms how attractive is it in life how beautiful in representation It is one of those objects that please as many do both in nature and on canvas But  would you see the human face in it's highest form of  picturesque beauty  examine that pa∣triarchal head What is it which gives that dignity of character that force of expression those lines of wisdom and experience that energetic meaning so far beyond the rosy hue or even the bewitching smile of youth What is it but the forehead furrowed with wrinkles the prominent cheekbone catching the light the muscles of the cheek strongly marked and losing themselves in the shaggy beard and above all the austere brow projecting over the eyethat feature which particularly struck Homer in his idea of Jupiter  It is much more probable that the poet copied  forms  from the sculptor who must be supposed to understand them better from having studied them more than that the sculptor should copy them from the poet Artists however have taken advan∣tage of the prepossession of the world for Homer to secure approbation to their works by acknowledging them to be re∣flected images of his conceptions So Phidias assured his countrymen that he had taken his Jupiter from the description of that god in the first book of Homer The fact is none of the features contained in that image except the brow can be rendered by sculpture But he knew what advantage such ideas as his art could express would receive from being con∣nected in the mind of the spectator with those furnished by poetry and from the just partiality of men for such a  poet He seems therefore to have been as well acquainted with the mind of man as with his shape and faceIf by  we understand as I think we may  a projecting brow which casts a broad  and  deep shadow over the eye  Clarke has rendered it ill by  nigris superciliis  which most people would construe into  black eyebrows  Nor has Pope tho he affected a knowledge of painting translated it more happily by  sable brows  But if Phidias had had nothing to recommend him except his having availed himself of the only feature in the poet which was accommodated to his art we should not have heard of inquirers wondering from whence he had drawn his ideas nor of the compliment which it gave him an opportunity of paying to Homer  and which  he had probably seen finely represented in some statue in a word what is it but the  rough  touches of age  As an object of the mixed kind partaking both of the  beautiful  and the  picturesque  we admire the human figure also The lines and surface of a beautiful human form are so in∣finitely varied the lights and shades which it receives are so exquisitely tender in some parts and yet so round and bold in others it's proportions are so just and it's limbs so fitted to receive all the beauties of grace and contrast that even the face in which the charms of intelligence and sensibility reside is almost lost in the comparison But altho the human form in a quiescent state is thus  beautiful yet the more it's  smooth surface is ruffled  if I may so speak the more pictu∣resque it appears When it is agitated by passion and it's muscles swoln by strong ex∣ertion the whole frame is shewn to the most advantageBut when we speak of muscles swoln by exertion we mean only natural exer∣tions not an affected display of anatomy in which the muscles tho justly placed may still be overcharged  It is true we are better pleased with the usual representations we meet with of the human form in a quiescent state than in an agitated one but this is merely owing to our seldom seeing it naturally represented in strong action Even among the best masters we see little knowledge of anatomy One will inflate the muscles violently to produce some trifling effect another will scarce swell them in the production of a laboured one The eye soon learns to see a defect tho unable to remedy it But when the anatomy is perfectly just the human body will always be more picturesque in action than at rest The great difficulty indeed of representing strong muscular motion seems to have struck the ancient masters of sculpture for it is certainly much harder to  model from a figure in strong momentary action which must as it were be shot flying than from one sitting or standing which the artist may copy at leisure Amidst the variety of statues transmitted from their hands we have only three or four in very spirited ac∣tion  Tho there are only perhaps two or three of the first an∣tique statues in  very spirited  actionthe Laocoon the fighting gladiator and the boxersyet there are several others which are  in action  the Apollo BelvidereMichael Angelo's Torso Arria and Paetusthe Pietas militaris sometimes called the Ajax of which the Pasquin at Rome is a part and of which there is a repetition more intire tho still much mutilated at Florencethe Alexander and Bucephalus and perhaps some others which occur not to my memory The paucity however of them even if a longer catalogue could be produced I think shews that the ancient sculptors considered the representation of  spirited action  as an atchievement The moderns have been less daring in attempting it But I believe connoisseurs universally give the preference to those statues in which the great masters have so successfully exhibited animated action  Yet when we see an effect of this kind well executed our admiration is greatly in∣creased Who does not admire the Laocoon more than the Antinous  Animal life as well as human is in gene∣ral beautiful both in nature and on canvas We admire the horse as a  real object  the elegance of his form the stateliness of his  tread the spirit of all his motions and the glossiness of his coat We admire him also in  representation  But as an object of pictu∣resque beauty we admire more the wornout carthorse the cow the goat or the ass whose harder lines and rougher coats exhibit more the graces of the pencil For the truth of this we may examine Berghem's pictures we may examine the smart touch of Rosa of Tivoli The lion with his rough mane the bristly boar and the ruffled plumage of the eagle  The idea of the  ruffled plumage of the eagle  is taken from the celebrated eagle of Pindar in his first Pythian ode which has exercised the pens of several poets and is equally poetical and picturesque He is introduced as an instance of the power of music In Gray's ode on the progress of poesy we have the following picture of him  Perching on the sceptered hand  Of Jove thy magic lulls the feathered king  With ruffled plumes and flagging wing  Quenched in dark clouds of slumber lie  The terror of his beak and lightening of his eye  Akenside's picture of him in his hymn to the Naiads is rather a little stiffly painted  With slackened wings  While now the solemn concert breathes around  Incumbent on the sceptre of his lord  Sleeps the stern eagle by the numbered notes  Possessed and satiate with the melting tone  Sovereign of birds  West's picture especially the two last lines is a very good one  The bird's fierce monarch drops his vengeful ire  Perched on the sceptre of th' Olympian king  The thrilling power of harmony he feels  And indolently hangs his flagging wing  While gentle sleep his closing eyelid seals  And o'er his heaving limbs in loose array  To every balmy gale the ruffling feathers play  are all objects of this kind Smoothcoated  animals could not produce so pictu∣resque an effect  But when the painter thus prefers the carthorse the cow or the ass to other objects  more beautiful in themselves  he does not cer∣tainly recommend his art to those whose love of beauty makes them anxiously seek by what means it's fleeting forms may be fixed  Suggestions of this kind are ungrateful The art of painting allows you all you wish You desire to have a beautiful object painted your horse for instance led out of the stable  in all his pampered beauty The art of paint∣ing is ready to accommodate you You have the beautiful form you admired in nature ex∣actly transferred to canvas Be then satisfied The art of painting has given you what you wanted It is no injury to the beauty of your Arabian if the painter think he could have given the graces of his art more forcibly to your carthorse  But does it not depreciate his art if he give up a beautiful form for one less beautiful merely because he could have given it  the graces of his art more forcibly  because it's sharp lines afford him a greater facility of execu∣tion Is the smart touch of a pencil the grand desideratum of painting Does he dis∣cover nothing in  picturesque objects  but qualities which admit of being  rendered with spirit  I should not vindicate him if he did At the same time a free execution is so very fascinating a part of painting that we need not wonder if the artist lay a great stress upon itIt is not however intirely owing as some imagine to the difficulty of master∣ing an elegant line that he prefers a rough one In part indeed this may be the case  for if an elegant line be not delicately hit off it is the most insipid of all lines whereas in the description of a rough object an error in delineation is not easily seen However this is not the whole of the matter A free bold touch is in itself pleasing  A stroke may be called  free  when there is no appearance of constraint It is  bold  when a part is given for the whole which it cannot fail of suggesting This is the laconism of genius But sometimes it may be free and yet suggest only how easily a line which means nothing may be executed Such a stroke is not  bold  but  impudent  In elegant figures indeed there must be a delicate outlineat least a line true to nature yet the surfaces even of such figures may be touched with freedom and in the appen∣dages of the composition there must be a mixture of rougher objects or there will be a want of contrast In landscape universally the rougher objects are admired which give the freest scope to execution If the pencil be timid or hesitating little beauty results The execution then only is pleasing when the hand firm and yet decisive freely touches the characteristic parts of each object  If indeed either in literary or in pic∣turesque composition you endeavour to draw the reader or the spectator from the  subject  to the  mode of executing  it your affectation  Language like light is a medium and the true phi∣losophic stile like light from a northwindow exhibits objects clearly and distinctly without soliciting attention to itself In painting subjects of amusement indeed language may gild somewhat more and colour with the dies of fancy but where information is of more importance than entertainment tho you cannot throw too  strong  a light you should carefully avoid a  coloured  one The stile of some writers resembles a bright light placed between the eye and the thing to be looked at The light shews itself and hides the object and it must be allowed the execution of some painters is as impertinent as the stile of such writers  dis∣gusts At the same time if some care and pains be not bestowed on the  execution  your slovenliness disgusts as much Tho perhaps the artist has more to say than the man of let∣ters for paying attention to his  execution  A truth is a truth whether delivered in the lan∣guage of a philosopher or a peasant and the  intellect  receives it as such But the artist who deals in lines surfaces and colours which are an immediate address to the  eye  con∣ceives the  very truth itself  concerned in his  mode  of representing it Guido's angel and  the angel on a signpost are very different beings but the whole of the difference con∣sists in an artful application of lines surfaces and colours  It is not however merely for the sake of his  execution  that the artist values a rough object He finds it in many other respects accommodated to his art In the first place his  composition  requires it If the historypainter threw all his draperies smooth over his figures his groups and combinations would be very awkward And in  landscapepainting  smooth objects would produce no composition at all In a mountainscene what composition could arise from the corner of a smooth knoll coming forward on one side intersected by a smooth knoll on the other with a smooth plain perhaps in the middle and a smooth mountain in the distance The very idea is disgusting Picturesque compo∣sition consists in uniting in one whole a variety of parts and these parts can only be obtained from rough objects If the smooth moun∣tains and plains were broken by different objects the composition might be good on a supposition the great lines of it were so before  Variety  too is equally necessary in his com∣position so is  contrast  Both these he finds in rough objects and neither of them in smooth Variety indeed in some degree he may find in the outline of a smooth object but by no means enough to satisfy the eye without including the surface also  From  rough  objects also he seeks the  effect of light and shade  which they are as well disposed to produce as they are the beauty of composition One uniform light or one uniform shade produces no effect It is the various surfaces of objects sometimes turn∣ing to the light in one way and sometimes in another that give the painter his choice of opportunities in massing and graduating both his lights and shadesThe  richness  also of the light depends on the breaks and little recesses which it finds on the surfaces of bodies What the painter calls  richness  on a surface is only a variety of little parts on which the light shining shews all it's small inequalities and roughnesses and in the painter's language  inriches  itThe beauty also of  catching lights  arises from the roughness of objects What the painter calls a  catching light  is a strong touch of light  on some prominent part of a surface while the rest is in shadow A smooth surface has no such prominences  In  colouring  also  rough  objects give the painter another advantage Smooth bodies are commonly as uniform in their colour as they are in their surface In glossy objects tho smooth the colouring may sometimes vary In general however it is otherwise in the objects of landscape particularly The smooth side of a hill is generally of one uniform colour while the fractured rock presents it's grey surface adorned with patches of greensward running down it's guttered sides and the broken ground is every where varied with an okery tint a grey gravel or a leadencoloured clay so that in fact the rich colours of the ground arise generally from it's broken surface  From such reasoning then we infer that it is not merely for the sake of his  execution  that the painter prefers  rough  objects to  smooth  The very essence of his art requires it  As picturesque beauty therefore so greatly depends on  rough  objects are we to exclude every idea of  smoothness  from mixing with it Are we struck with no pleasing image when the lake is spread upon the canvas the  mar∣moreum aequor  pure limpid smooth as the polished mirror  We acknowledge it to be picturesque but we must at the same time recollect that in fact the smoothness of the lake is more in  reality  than in  appearance  Were it spread upon the canvas in one simple hue it would certainly be a dull fatiguing object But to the eye it appears broken by shades of various kinds by the undulations of the water or by reflections from all the rough objects in it's neighbourhood  It is thus too in other glossy bodies Tho the horse in a  rough  state as we have just observed or worn down with labour is more adapted to the pencil than when his sides shine with brushing and highfeeding yet in this latter state also he is certainly a pictu∣resque object But it is not his smooth and shining coat that makes him so It is the apparent interruption of that smoothness by a variety of shades and colours which produces  the effect Such a play of muscles appears every where through the fineness of his skin gently swelling and sinking into each other he is all over so  lubricus aspici  the reflections of light are so continually shifting upon him and playing into each other that the eye never considers the smoothness of the surface but is amused with gliding up and down among these endless transitions which in some degree supply the room of  roughness  It is thus too in the plumage of birds Nothing can be softer nothing smoother to the touch and yet it is certainly picturesque But it is not the smoothness of the surface which produces the effectit is not this we admire it is the breaking of the colours it is the bright green or purple changing perhaps into a rich azure or velvet black from thence taking a semitint and so on through all the varieties of colour Or if the colour be not changeable it is the harmony we admire in these elegant little touches of na∣ture's pencil The smoothness of the surface is only the ground of the colours In itself we admire it no more than we do the smooth∣ness of the canvas which receives the colours of the picture Even the plumage of the swan  which to the inaccurate observer appears only of one simple hue is in fact varied with a thousand soft shadows and brilliant touches at once discoverable to the picturesque eye  Thus too a piece of polished marble may be picturesque but it is only when the polish brings out beautiful veins which in  appearance  break the surface by a variety of lines and colours Let the marble be perfectly white and the effect vanishes Thus also a mirror may have picturesque beauty but it is only from it's reflections In an unreflecting state it is insipid  In statuary we sometimes see an inferior artist give his marble a gloss thinking to atone for his bad workmanship by his excellent polish The effect shews in how small a degree smoothness enters into the idea of the picturesque When the light plays on the shining coat of a pampered horse it plays among the lines and muscles of nature and is therefore founded in truth But the polish of marbleflesh is unnatural  On all human flesh held between the eye and the light there is a degree of polish I speak not here of such a polish  as this which wrought marble always in a degree possesses as well as human flesh but of the highest polish which can be given to marble and which has always a very bad effect If I wanted an example the bust of archbishop Boulter in West∣minsterabbey would afford a very glaring one  The lights  therefore are false and smoothness being here one of the chief qualities to admire we are disgusted and say it makes bad worse  After all we mean not to assert that even a simple smooth surface is in no situation pic∣turesque In  contrast  it certainly may be nay in contrast it is often necessary The beauty of an old head is greatly improved by the smoothness of the bald pate and the rougher parts of the rock must necessarily be set off with the smoother But the point lies here to make an object in a peculiar man∣ner picturesque there  must be  a proportion of  roughness  so much at least as to make an opposition which in an object simply beau∣tiful is unnecessary  Some quibbling opponent may throw out that wherever there is smoothness there must also be roughness The smoothest plain con∣sists of many rougher parts and the roughest rock of many smoother and there is such a variety of degrees in both that it is hard to  say where you have the precise ideas of  rough  and  smooth  To this it is enough that the province of the picturesque eye is to  survey nature  not to  anatomize matter  It throws it's glances around in the broadcast stile It comprehends an extensive tract at each sweep It examines  parts  but never descends to  particles  Having thus from a variety of examples en∣deavoured to shew that  roughness  either  real  or  apparent  forms an essential difference be∣tween the  beautiful  and the  picturesque  it may be expected that we should point out the reason of this difference It is obvious enough why the painter prefers  rough  objects to  smooth  See page c  but it is not so obvious why the quality of  roughness  should make an  essential difference  between the objects of  nature  and the objects of  artificial representation  To this question we might answer that the picturesque eye abhors art and delights solely in nature and that as art abounds with  regularity  which is only another name  for  smoothness  and the images of nature with  irregularity  which is only another name for  roughness  we have here a solution of our question  But is this solution satisfactory I fear not Tho art often abounds with regularity it does not follow that all art must necessarily do so The picturesque eye it is true finds it's  chief  objects in nature but it delights also in the images of art if they are marked with the characteristics which it requires  A painter's nature  is whatever he  imitates  whether the object be what is commonly called natural or artificial Is there a greater ornament of landscape than the ruins of a castle What painter rejects it because it is artificialWhat beautiful effects does Vandervelt produce from shipping In the hands of such a master it furnishes almost as beautiful forms as any in the whole circle of picturesque objectsAnd what could the historypainter do without his draperies to combine contrast and harmonize his figures Uncloathed they could never be grouped How could he tell his story with∣out arms religious utensils and the rich furniture of banquets Many of these con∣tribute  greatly to embellish his pictures with pleasing shapes  Shall we then seek the solution of our question in the great foundation of picturesque beauty in the  happy union of simplicity and variety  to which the  rough  ideas essentially contribute An extended plain is a simple object It is the continuation only of one uniform idea But the mere  simplicity  of a plain produces no beauty Break the sur∣face of it as you did your pleasureground add trees rocks and declivities that is give it  roughness  and you give it also  variety  Thus by inriching the  parts  of a united  whole  with  roughness  you obtain the combined idea of  simplicity  and  variety  from whence results the picturesqueIs this a satisfactory answer to our question  By no means  Simplicity and variety  are sources of the  beautiful  as well as of the  picturesque  Why does the architect break the front of his pile with ornaments Is it not to add variety to smplicity Even the very blacksmith acknowledges this prin∣ciple by forming ringlets and bulbous circles on his tongs and pokers In nature it is the same and your plain will just as much  be improved  in reality  by breaking it as  upon canvas  In a gardenscene the idea is dif∣ferent There every object is of the neat and elegant kind What is otherwise is in∣harmonious and  roughness  would be disorder  Shall we then change our ground and seek an answer to our question in the nature of the art of painting As it is an art  strictly imi∣tative  those objects will of course appear most advantageously to the picturesque eye which are the most easily imitated The stronger the features are the stronger will be the effect of imitation and as rough objects have the strongest features they will conse∣quently when represented appear to most advantageIs this answer more satisfactory  Very little in truth Every painter knows that a smooth object may be as easily and as well imitated as a rough one  Shall we then take an opposite ground and say just the reverse as men pressed with dif∣ficulties will say any thing that painting is  not  an art  strictly imitative  but rather  deceptive  that by an assemblage of colours and a peculiar art in spreading them the painter gives a semblance of nature at a proper dis∣tance which at hand is quite another thing  that those objects which we call picturesque are only such as are more adapted to this art and that as this art is most concealed in rough touches rough objects are of course the most picturesqueHave we now at∣tained a satisfactory account of the matter  Just as much so as before Many painters of note did not use the rough stile of painting and yet their pictures are as admirable as the pictures of those who did nor are rough objects less picturesque on their canvas than on the canvas of others that is they paint rough objects smoothly  Thus foiled shall we in the true spirit of inquiry persist or honestly give up the cause and own we cannot search out the source of this difference I am afraid this is the truth whatever airs of dogmatizing we may assume Inquiries into  principles  rarely end in satisfac∣tion Could we even gain satisfaction in our present question new doubts would arise The very first principles of our art would be ques∣tioned Difficulties would start up  vestibulum ante ipsum  We should be asked What is beauty What is tasteLet us step aside a moment and listen to the debates of the learned on these heads They will at least  shew us that however we may wish to six  principles  our inquiries are seldom satisfactory  One philosopher will tell us that taste is only the improvement of our own ideas Every man has naturally his proportion of taste The seeds of it are innate All depends on culti∣vation  Another philosopher following the analogy of nature observes that as all mens faces are different we may well suppose their minds to be so likewise He rejects the idea there∣fore of innate taste and in the room of this makes  utility  the standard both of taste and beauty  Another philosopher thinks the idea of  utility  as absurd as the last did that of  innate taste  What cries he can I not admire the beauty of a resplendent sunset till I have investigated the  utility  of that peculiar radiance in the at∣mosphere He then wishes we had a little less philosophy amongst us and a little more common sense  Common sense  is despised like other common things but in his opinion if we made  common sense  the criterion in matters of art as well as science we should be nearer the truth  A fourth philosopher apprehends  common sense  to be our standard only in the ordinary affairs of life The bounty of nature has furnished us with various other senses suited to the objects among which we converse and with regard to matters of taste it has supplied us with what he doubts not we all feel within our∣selves  a sense of beauty  Pooh says another learned inquirer what is a  sense of beauty Sense  is a vague idea and so is  beauty  and it is impossible that any thing determined can result from terms so inaccurate But if we lay aside a  sense of beauty  and adopt  proportion  we shall all be right  Proportion  is the great principle of taste and beauty We admit it both in lines and colours and indeed refer all our ideas of the elegant kind to it's standard  True says an admirer of the antique but this proportion must have a rule or we gain nothing and a  rule of proportion  there cer∣tainly is but we may inquire after it in vain The secret is lost The ancients had it They well knew the principles of beauty and had that unerring rule which in all things adjusted their taste We see it even in their slightest vases In  their  works proportion tho varied  through a thousand lines is still the same and if we could only discover their  principles of proportion  we should have the arcanum of this science and might settle all our disputes about taste with great ease  Thus in our inquiries into  first principles  we go on without end and without satis∣faction The human understanding is unequal to the search In philosophy we inquire for them in vainin physicsin metaphysicsin morals Even in the polite arts where the subject one should imagine is less recondite the inquiry we find is equally vague We are puzzled and bewildered but not informed All is uncertainty a strife of words the old contest  Empedocles an Stertinii deliret acumen  In a word if  a cause be sufficiently understood  it may suggest useful discoveries But if it be  not so  and where is our certainty in these disquisitions it will unquestionably  mislead  END OF THE FIRST ESSAY  AS the subject of the foregoing essay is rather new and I doubted whether sufficiently founded in truth I was desirous before I printed it that it should receive the  imprimatur  of sir Joshua Reynolds I begged him therefore to look it over and received the following answer  London  April th  DEAR SIR  Tho I read now but little yet I have read with great attention the essay which you was so good to put into my hands on the difference between the  beautiful  and the  picturesque  and I may truly say I have re∣ceived from it much pleasure and improve∣ment  Without opposing any of your sentiments it has suggested an idea that may be worth considerationwhether the epithet  picturesque  is not applicable to the excellences of the inferior schools rather than to the higher  The works of Michael Angelo Raphael c appear to me to have nothing of it whereas Reubens and the Venetian painters may almost be said to have nothing else  Perhaps  picturesque  is somewhat synonymous to the word  taste  which we should think im∣properly applied to Homer or Milton but very well to Pope or Prior I suspect that the application of these words are to excellences of an inferior order and which are incompatible with the grand stile  You are certainly right in saying that va∣riety of tints and forms is picturesque but it must be remembred on the other hand that the reverse of thisuniformity of colour and a long continuation of lines produces gran∣deur  I had an intention of pointing out the passages that particularly struck me but I was afraid to use my eyes so much  The essay has lain upon my table and I think no day has passed without my looking at it reading a little at a time Whatever ob∣jections presented themselves at first view  Sir Joshua Reynolds had seen this essay several years ago through Mr Mason who shewed it to him He then made  some objections to it particularly he thought that the term  picturesque  should be applied only to the  works of nature  His concession here is an instance of that candour which is a very remarkable part of his character and which is generally one of the distinguishing marks of true genius  were done away on a closer inspection and I am not quite sure but that is the case in regard to the observation which I have ventured to make on the word  picturesque  I am c JOSHUA REYNOLDS  To the rev  d  Mr Gilpin  Vicar'shill  THE ANSWER  May d  DEAR SIR  I am much obliged to you for looking over my essay at a time when the complaint in your eyes must have made an intrusion of this kind troublesome But as the subject was rather novel I wished much for your sanction and you have given it me in as flattering a manner as I could wish  With regard to the term  picturesque  I have always myself used it merely to denote  such objects as are proper subjects for painting  so that according to  my definition  one of the cartoons and a flowerpiece are equally pic∣turesque  I think however I understand your idea of extending the term to what may be called  taste in painting  or the art of fascinating the eye by splendid colouring and artificial com∣binations which the inferior schools valued and the dignity of the higher perhaps despised But I have seen so little of the higher schools that I should be very ill able to carry the sub∣ject farther by illustrating a disquisition of this kind Except the cartoons I never saw a picture of Raphael's that answered my idea and of the original works of Michael Angelo I have little conception  But tho I am unable through ignorance to appreciate fully the grandeur of the Roman school I have at least the pleasure to find I have always held as a principle your idea of the production of greatness by  uniformity of colour and a long continuation of line  and when I speak of  variety  I certainly do not mean to confound it's effects with those of  grandeur  I am c WILLIAM GILPIN  To sir Joshua Reynolds  Leicestersquare  ESSAY II ON PICTURESQUE TRAVEL  ESSAY II  ENOUGH has been said to shew the difficulty of  assigning causes  let us then take another course and amuse ourselves with  searching after effects  This is the general intention of picturesque travel We mean not to bring it into competition with any of the more useful ends of travelling but as many travel without any end at all amusing them∣selves without being able to give a reason why they are amused we offer an end which may possibly engage some vacant minds and may indeed afford a rational amusement to such as travel for more important purposes  In treating of picturesque travel we may consider first it's  object  and secondly it's sources of  amusement  It's  object  is beauty of every kind which either art or nature can produce but it is chiefly that species of  picturesque beauty  which we have endeavoured to characterize in the preceding essay This great object we pursue through the scenery of nature and examine it by the rules of painting We seek it among all the ingredients of landscapetreesrocks brokengroundswoodsriverslakes plainsvalliesmountainsand distances These objects  in themselves  produce infinite variety No two rocks or trees are exactly the same They are varied a second time by  combination  and almost as much a third time by different  lights and shades  and other aerial effects Sometimes we find among them the exhibition of  a whole  but oftener we find only beautiful  parts  As some of these topics have been occasionally men∣tioned in other picturesque works which the author has given the public they are here touched very slightly only the sub∣ject required they should be brought together  That we may examine picturesque objects with more ease it may be useful to class them into the  sublime  and the  beautiful  tho in fact this distinction is rather inaccurate  Sublimity alone  cannot make an object  pic∣turesque  However grand the mountain or the rock may be it has no claim to this epithet unless it's form it's colour or it's accompaniments have  some degree of beauty  Nothing can be more sublime than the ocean but wholly unaccompanied it has little of the picturesque When we talk therefore of a sublime object we always understand that it is also beautiful and we call it sublime or beautiful only as the ideas of sublimity or of simple beauty prevail  The  curious  and  fantastic  forms of nature are by no means the favourite objects of the lovers of landscape There may be beauty in a  curious  object and so far it may be picturesque but we cannot admire it merely for the sake of it's curiosity The  lusus naturae  is the naturalist's province not the painter's The spiry pinnacles of the mountain and the castlelike arrangement of the rock give no peculiar pleasure to the picturesque eye It is fond of the simplicity of nature and sees most beauty in her  most usual  forms The  Giant's causeway  in Ireland may strike it as a novelty but the lake of Killarney attracts it's attention It would range with supreme  delight among the sweet vales of Switzerland but would view only with a transient glance the Glaciers of Savoy Scenes of this kind as unusual may please  once  but the great works of nature in her simplest and purest stile open inexhausted springs of amusement  But it is not only the  form  and the  com∣position  of the objects of landscape which the picturesque eye examines it connects them with the atmosphere and seeks for all those various effects which are produced from that vast and wonderful storehouse of nature Nor is there in travelling a greater pleasure than when a scene of grandeur bursts unexpectedly upon the eye accompanied with some acci∣dental circumstance of the atmosphere which harmonizes with it and gives it double value  Besides the  inanimate  face of nature it's  living forms  fall under the picturesque eye in the course of travel and are often objects of great attention The anatomical study of figures is not attended to we regard them merely as the ornament of scenes In the human figure we contemplate neither  exactness of form  nor  expression  any farther than it is shewn in  action  we merely consider general shapes dresses groups and occupations which  we often find  casually  in greater variety and beauty than any selection can procure  In the same manner animals are the objects of our attention whether we find them in the park the forest or the field Here too we consider little more than their general forms actions and combinations Nor is the pic∣turesque eye so fastidious as to despise even less considerable objects A flight of birds has often a pleasing effect In short every form of life and being has it's use as a picturesque object till it become too small for attention  But the picturesque eye is not merely res∣tricted to nature It ranges through the limits of art The picture the statue and the gar∣den are all the objects of it's attention In the embellished pleasureground particularly tho all is neat and elegantfar too neat and elegant for the use of the pencil yet if it be well laid out it exhibits the  lines  and  principles  of landscape and is well worth the study of the picturesque traveller Nothing is wanting but what his imagination can supplya change from smooth to rough  See page  But among all the objects of art the pictu∣resque eye is perhaps most inquisitive after the elegant relics of ancient architecture the ruined tower the Gothic arch the remains of castles and abbeys These are the richest legacies of art They are consecrated by time and al∣most deserve the veneration we pay to the works of nature itself  Thus universal are the objects of picturesque travel We pursue  beauty  in every shape through nature through art and all it's various arrangements in form and colour admiring it in the grandest objects and not rejecting it in the humblest  From the  objects  of picturesque travel we consider it's  sources of amusement  or in what way the mind is gratified by these objects  We might begin in moral stile and consider the objects of nature in a higher light than merely as amusement We might observe that a search after beauty should naturally lead the mind to the great origin of all beauty to the  first good first perfect and first fair  But tho in theory this seems a natural climax we insist the less upon it as in fact we have scarce ground to hope that every admirer of  picturesque beauty  is an admirer also of the  beauty of virtue  and that every lover of nature reflects that  Nature is but a name for an  effect  Whose  cause  is God  If however the admirer of nature can turn his amusements to a higher purpose if it's great scenes can inspire him with religious awe or it's tranquil scenes with that compla∣cency of mind which is so nearly allied to benevolence it is certainly the better  Appo∣nat lucro  It is so much into the bargain for we dare not  promise  him more from pictu∣resque travel than a rational and agreeable amusement Yet even this may be of some use in an age teeming with licentious pleasure and may in this light at least be considered as having a moral tendency  The first source of amusement to the pictu∣resque traveller is the  pursuit  of his object the expectation of new scenes continually open∣ing and arising to his view We suppose the country to have been unexplored Under this circumstance the mind is kept constantly in an  agreeable suspence The love of novelty is the foundation of this pleasure Every distant ho∣rizon promises something new and with this pleasing expectation we follow nature through all her walks We pursue her from hill to dale and hunt after those various beauties with which she every where abounds  The pleasures of the chase are universal A hare started before dogs is enough to set a whole country in an uproar The plough and the spade are deserted Care is left be∣hind and every human faculty is dilated with joy  And shall we suppose it a greater pleasure to the sportsman to pursue a trivial animal than it is to the man of taste to pursue the beauties of nature to follow her through all her recesses to obtain a sudden glance as she flits past him in some airy shape to trace her through the mazes of the cover to wind after her along the vale or along the reaches of the river  After the pursuit we are gratified with the  attainment  of the object Our amusement on this head arises from the employment of the mind in examining the beautiful scenes we have found Sometimes we examine them under the idea of a  whole  we admire the com∣position  the colouring and the light in one  comprehensive view  When we are fortunate enough to fall in with scenes of this kind we are highly delighted But as we have less frequent opportunities of being thus gratified we are more commonly employed in analyzing the  parts of scenes  which may be exquisitely beautiful tho unable to produce a whole We examine what would amend the composition how little is wanting to reduce it to the rules of our art what a trifling circumstance sometimes forms the limit between beauty and deformity Or we com∣pare the objects before us with other objects of the same kindor perhaps we compare them with the imitations of art From all these operations of the mind results great amusement  But it is not from this  scientifical  employ∣ment that we derive our chief pleasure We are most delighted when some grand scene tho perhaps of incorrect composition rising before the eye strikes us beyond the power of thoughtwhen the  vox faucibus haeret  and every mental operation is suspended In this pause of intellect this  deliquium  of the soul an enthusiastic sensation of pleasure overspreads  it previous to any examination by the rules of art The general idea of the scene makes an impression before any appeal is made to the judgment We rather  feel  than  survey  it  This high delight is generally indeed pro∣duced by the scenes of nature yet sometimes by artificial objects Here and there a capital picture will raise these emotions but oftener the rough sketch of a capital master This has sometimes an astonishing effect on the mind giving the imagination an opening into all those glowing ideas which inspired the artist and which the imagination  only  can translate In general however the works of art affect us coolly and allow the eye to cri∣ticize at leisure  Having gained by a minute examination of incidents a compleat idea of an object our next amusement arises from inlarging and correcting our general stock of ideas The variety of nature is such that  new objects  and new combinations of them are continually adding something to our fund and inlarging our collection while the  same kind of object  occurring frequently is seen under various shapes and makes us if I may so speak more learned in nature We get it more by heart  He who has seen only one oaktree has no compleat idea of an oak in general but he who has examined thousands of oaktrees must have seen that beautiful plant in all it's va∣rieties and obtains a full and compleat idea of it  From this correct knowledge of objects arises another amusement that of representing by a few strokes in a sketch those ideas which have made the most impression upon us A few scratches like a shorthand scrawl of our own legible at least to ourselves will serve to raise in our minds the remembrance of the beauties they humbly represent and recal to our memory even the splendid colouring and force of light which existed in the real scene Some naturalists suppose the act of rumina∣ting in animals to be attended with more pleasure than the act of grosser mastication It may be so in travelling also There may be more pleasure in recollecting and record∣ing from a few transient lines the scenes we have admired than in the present enjoyment of them If the scenes indeed have  peculiar greatness  this secondary pleasure cannot be at∣tended with those enthusiastic feelings which accompanied the real exhibition But in  general tho it may be a calmer species of plea∣sure it is more uniform and uninterrupted It flatters us too with the idea of a sort of creation of our own and it is unallayed with that fatigue which is often a considerable abatement to the pleasures of traversing the wild and savage parts of natureAfter we have amused  ourselves  with our sketches if we can in any degree contribute to the amusement of others also the pleasure is surely so much inhanced  There is still another amusement arising from the correct knowledge of objects and that is the power of creating and representing  scenes of fancy  which is still more a work of creation than copying from nature The imagination becomes a camera obscura only with this difference that the camera represents objects as they really are while the imagi∣nation impressed with the most beautiful scenes and chastened by rules of art forms it's pictures not only from the most admirable parts of nature but in the best taste  Some artists when they give their imagi∣nation play let it loose among uncommon scenessuch as perhaps never existed whereas the nearer they approach the simple standard  of nature in it's most beautiful forms the more admirable their fictions will appear It is thus in writing romances The correct taste cannot bear those unnatural situations in which heroes and heroines are often placed whereas a story  naturally  and of course  af∣fectingly  told either with a pen or a pencil tho known to be a fiction is considered as a transcript from nature and takes possession of the heart The  marvellous  disgusts the sober imagination which is gratified only with the pure characters of nature  Beauty best is taught  By those the favoured few whom heaven has lent  The power to seize select and reunite  Her loveliest features and of these to form  One archetype compleat of sovereign grace  Here nature sees her fairest forms more fair  Owns them as hers yet owns herself excelled  By what herself produced  But if we are unable to embody our ideas even in a humble sketch yet still a strong  impression of nature  will enable us to judge of the  works of art  Nature is the archetype The stronger therefore the impression the better the judgment  We are in some degree also amused by the very visions of fancy itself Often when slumber has halfclosed the eye and shut out all the objects of sense especially after the enjoyment of some splendid scene the ima∣gination active and alert collects it's scat∣tered ideas transposes combines and shifts them into a thousand forms producing such exquisite scenes such sublime arrangements such glow and harmony of colouring such brilliant lights such depth and clearness of shadow as equally foil description and every attempt of artificial colouring  It may perhaps be objected to the pleasure∣able circumstances which are thus said to attend picturesque travel that we meet as many disgusting as pleasing objects and the man of taste therefore will be as often offended as amused  But this is not the case There are few parts of nature which do not yield a picturesque eye some amusement  Believe the muse  She does not know that unauspicious spot  Where beauty is thus niggard of her store  Believe the muse through this terrestrial waste  The seeds of grace are sown profusely sown  Even where we least may hope  It is true when some large tract of barren country  interrupts  our expectation wound up in quest of any particular scene of grandeur or beauty we are apt to be a little peevish and to express our discontent in hasty ex∣aggerated phrase But when there is no disappointment in the case even scenes the most barren of beauty will furnish amuse∣ment  Perhaps no part of England comes more under this description than that tract of bar∣ren country through which the great military road passes from Newcastle to Carlisle It is a waste with little interruption through a space of forty miles But even here we have always something to amuse the eye The interchangeable patches of heath and greensward make an agreeable variety Often too on these vast tracts of intersecting grounds we see beautiful lights softening off along the sides of hills and often we see them adorned with cattle flocks of sheep heathcocks grous plover and flights of other wildfowl A group of cattle standing in  the shade on the edge of a dark hill and relieved by a lighter distance beyond them will often make a compleat picture without any other accompaniment In many other situations also we find them wonderfully pleasing and capable of making pictures amidst all the deficiences of landscape Even a winding road itself is an object of beauty while the richness of the heath on each side with the little hillocs and crumbling earth give many an excellent lesson for a fore∣ground When we have no opportunity of examining the  grand scenery  of nature we have every where at least the means of ob∣serving with what a  multiplicity of parts  and yet with what  general simplicity  she covers every surface  But if we let the  imagination  loose even scenes like these administer great amusement The imagination can plant hills can form rivers▪ and lakes in vallies can build castles and abbeys and if it find no other amuse∣ment can dilate itself in vast ideas of space  But altho the picturesque traveller is seldom disappointed with  pure nature  however rude  yet we cannot deny but he is often offended with the productions of art He is disgusted with the formal separations of propertywith houses and towns the haunts of men which have much oftener a bad effect in landscape than a good one He is frequently disgusted also when art aims more at beauty than she ought How flat and insipid is often the gardenscene how puerile and absurd the banks of the river how smooth and par∣rallel the lawn and it's boundaries how unlike nature Even in the capital collec∣tion of pictures how seldom does he find  design composition expression character  or  har∣mony  either in  light  or  colouring  and how often does he drag through saloons and rooms of state only to hear a catalogue of the names of masters  The more refined our taste grows from the  study of nature  the more insipid are the  works of art  Few of it's efforts please The idea of the great original is so strong that the copy must be very pure if it do not dis∣gust But the varieties of nature's charts are such that study them as we can new va∣rieties will always arise and let our taste be ever so refined her works on which it is  formed at least when we consider them as  objects  must always go beyond it and fur∣nish fresh sources both of pleasure and amuse∣ment  END OF THE SECOND ESSAY  ESSAY III ON THE ART OF SKETCHING LANDSCAPE  ESSAY III  THE  art of sketching  is to the picturesque traveller what the art of writing is to the scholar Each is equally necessary to fix and communicate it's respective ideas  Sketches  are  either taken from the  imagi∣nation  or from  nature  When the  imaginary sketch  proceeds from the hands of a master it is very valuable It is his first conception which is commonly the strongest and the most brilliant The imagination of a painter really great in his profession is a magazine abound∣ing with all the elegant forms and striking effects which are to be found in nature These like a magician he calls up at pleasure with a wave of his hand bringing before the eye sometimes a scene from history or ro∣mance  and sometimes from the inanimate parts of nature And in these happy moments when the enthusiasm of his art is upon him he often produces from the glow of his imagi∣nation with a few bold strokes such wonder∣ful effusions of genius as the more sober and correct productions of his pencil cannot equal  It will always however be understood that such sketches must be  examined  also by an eye  learned in the art  and accustomed to pictu∣resque ideasan eye that can take up the halfformed images as the master leaves them give them a new creation and make up all that is not expressed from it's own storehouse I shall however dwell no longer on  ima∣ginary sketching  as it hath but little relation to my present subject Let me only add that altho this essay is meant chiefly to assist the picturesque traveller in taking  views from nature  the method recommended as far as it relates to  execution  may equally be applied to  imaginary sketches  Your intention in taking  views from nature  may either be to  fix them in your own memory  or to  convey in some degree your ideas to others  With regard to the former when you meet a scene you wish to sketch your first consi∣deration is to get it in the best point of view A few paces to the right or left make a great difference The ground which folds awkwardly here appears to fold more easily there and that long blank curtain of the castle which is so unpleasing a circumstance as you stand on one side is agreeably broken by a buttress on another  Having thus fixed your point of view your next consideration is how to reduce it properly within the compass of your paper for the scale of  nature  being so very different from  your  scale it is a matter of difficulty without some experience to make them coin∣cide If the landscape before you is extensive take care you do not include too much it may perhaps be divided more commodiously into two sketchesWhen you have fixed the portion of it you mean to take fix next on two or three principal points which you may just mark on your paper This will en∣able you the more easily to ascertain the re∣lative situation of the several objects  In sketching blacklead is the first instru∣ment commonly used Nothing glides so volubly over paper and executes an idea so quicklyIt has besides another advantage it's grey tint corresponds better with a wash than black or red chalk or any other pastile It admits also of easy correction  The virtue of these hasty blacklead sketches consists in catching readily the  cha∣racteristic features  of a scene Light and shade are not attended to It is enough if you express  general shapes  and the relations which the several intersections of a country bear to each other A few lines drawn on the spot will do this "Half a word says Mr Gray fixed on or near the spot is worth all our recollected ideas When we trust to the picture that objects draw of themselves on the mind we deceive ourselves Without accurate and particular observation it is but illdrawn at first the outlines are soon blur∣red the colours every day grow fainter and at last when we would produce it to any body we are obliged to supply it's defects  with a few strokes of our own imagination"  Letter to Mr Palgrave p to  What Mr Gray says relates chiefly to  verbal  description but in  lineal  description it is equally true The leading ideas must be fixed on the spot if left to the memory they soon evaporate  The lines of blacklead and indeed of any  one  instrument are subject to the great incon∣venience of  confounding distances  If there are two or three distances in the landscape as each of them is expressed by the  same kind  of line the eye forgets the distinction even in half a day's travelling and all is confusion To remedy this a few written references made on the spot are necessary if the land∣scape be at all complicated The traveller should be accurate in this point as the spirit of his view depends much on the proper ob∣servance of distancesAt his first leisure however he will review his sketch add a few strokes with a pen to mark the near grounds and by a slight wash of Indian ink throw in a few general lights and shades to keep all fixed and in it's placeA sketch  need not be carried farther when it is in∣tended merely to  assist our own memory  But when a sketch is intended  to convey in some degree our ideas to others  it is neces∣sary that it should be somewhat more adorned To  us  the scene familiar to our recollection may be suggested by a few rough strokes but if you wish to raise the idea  where none existed before  and to do it  agreeably  there should be some  composition  in your sketcha degree of  correctness and expression  in the outline and some  effect of light  A little  ornament  also from figures and other circumstances may be introduced In short it should be so far dressed as to give some idea of a picture I call this an  adorned sketch  and should sketch nothing that was not  capable  of being thus dressed An unpicturesque as∣semblage of objects and in general all untractable subjects if it be necessary to re∣present them may be given as plans rather than as pictures  In the first place I should advise the tra∣veller by no means to work his  adorned sketch  upon his  original one  His first sketch is the standard to which in the absence of nature he must at least recur for his  general ideas  By going over it again the original ideas may be lost and the whole thrown into con∣fusion Great masters therefore always set a high value on their sketches from nature On the same principle the picturesque tra∣veller preserves his original sketch tho in itself of little value to keep him within proper bounds  This matter being settled and the  adorned sketch  begun anew the first point is to fix the  composition  But the  composition  you say is already fixed by the  original sketch  It is true but still it may admit many little alterations by which the forms of objects may be assisted and yet the resem∣blance not disfigured as the same piece of music performed by different masters and graced variously by each may yet con∣tinue still the same We must ever recol∣lect that nature is most defective in com∣position and  must  be a little assisted Her ideas are too vast for picturesque use without the restraint of rules Liberties however with  truth must be taken with caution tho at the same time a distinction may be made between an  object  and a  scene  If I give the striking features of the  castle  or  abbey  which is my  object  I may be allowed some little liberty in bringing appendages which are not essential features within the rules of my art But in a  scene  the whole view becomes the portrait and if I flatter here I must flatter with de∣licacy  But whether I represent an  object  or a  scene  I hold myself at perfect liberty in the first place to dispose the  foreground  as I please restrained only by the analogy of the country I take up a tree here and plant it there I pare a knoll or make an addition to it I remove a piece of palinga cottagea wall or any removeable object which I dislike In short I do not so much mean to exact a liberty of introducing what does not exist as of making a few of those simple variations of which all ground is easily susceptible and which time itself indeed is continually making All this my art exacts  She rules the foreground she can swell or sink  It's surface here her leafy skreen oppose  And there withdraw here part the varying greens  And croud them there in one promiscuous gloom  As best befits the genius of the scene  The foreground indeed is a mere spot compa∣red with the extension of the distance in itself it is of trivial consequence and cannot well be called a  feature of the scene  And yet tho so little essential in  giving a likeness  it is more so than any other part in  forming a compo∣sition  It resembles those deep tones in music which give a value to all the lighter parts and harmonize the whole  As the foreground therefore is of so much consequence  begin  your  adorned sketch  with fixing this very material part It is easier to ascertain the situation of your foreground as it lies so near the bottom of your paper than any other part and this will tend to regulate every thing else In your rough sketch it has probably been inaccurately thrown in You could not so easily ascer∣tain it till you had gotten all your landscape together You might have carried it too high on your paper or have brought it too low As you have now the general scheme of your landscape before you you may adjust it properly and give it it's due proportion I shall add only on the subject of fore∣grounds  that you need not be very nice in finishing them even when you mean to  adorn  your sketches In a finished picture the fore∣ground is a matter of great nicety but in a sketch little more is necessary than to produce the effect you desire  Having fixed your foreground you consider in the same way tho with more caution the other parts of your  composition  In a  hasty transcript  from nature it is sufficient to take the lines of the country just as you find them but in your  adorned sketch  you must grace them a little where they run false You must contrive to hide offensive parts with wood to cover such as are too bald with  ushes and to remove little objects which in nature push themselves too much in sight and serve only to introduce too many parts into your  composition  In this happy adjust∣ment the grand merit of your sketch consists No beauty of light colouring or execution can atone for the want of  composition  It is the foundation of all picturesque beauty No finery of dress can set off a person whose figure is awkward and uncouth  Having thus  digested the composition  of your  adorned sketch  which is done with blacklead  you proceed to give a stronger outline to the foreground and nearer parts Some indeed use no outline but what they freely work with a brush on their blacklead sketch This comes nearest the idea of painting and as it is the most free it is perhaps also the most excellent method but as a blacklead outline is but a feeble termination it re∣quires a greater force in the wash to produce an effect and of course more the hand of a master The hand of a master indeed pro∣duces an effect with the rudest materials but these precepts aim only at giving a few in∣structions to the tyroes of the art and such will perhaps make their outline the most effectually with a pen As the pen is more determined than blacklead it leaves less to the brush which I think the more difficult instrumentIndian ink which may be heightened or lowered to any degree of strength or weakness so as to touch both the nearer and more distant grounds is the best ink you can use You may give a stroke with it so light as to confine even a remote distance tho such a distance is perhaps best left in blacklead  But when we speak of an  outline  we do not mean a  simple contour  which however necessary in a correct figure would in land∣scape be formal It is enough to mark with a few free touches of the pen here and there some of the breaks and roughnesses in which the richness of an object consists But you must first determine the situation of your lights that you may mark these touches on the shadowy side  Of these free touches with a pen the chief characteristic is  expression  or the art of giving each object that peculiar touch whether smooth or rough which best expresses it's form The art of painting in it's highest perfection cannot give the richness of nature When we examine any natural form we find the multiplicity of it's parts beyond the highest finishing and indeed generally an attempt at the highest finishing would end in stiffness The painter is obliged therefore to deceive the eye by some natural tint or expressive touch from which the imagination takes it's cue How often do we see in the landscapes of Claude the full effect of distance which when examined closely consists of a simple dash tinged with the hue of nature  intermixed with a few expressive touches If then these expressive touches are necessary where the master carries on the deception both in form and colour how necessary must they be in mere sketches in which colour the great vehicle of deception is removedThe art however of giving those expressive marks with a pen which impress ideas is no common one The inferior artist may give them by chance but the master only gives them with precisionYet a sketch may have it's use and even it's merit without these strokes of genius  As the difficulty of using the pen is such it may perhaps be objected that it is an improper instrument for a tyro It loses it's grace if it have not a ready and offhand execution  It is true but what other instrument shall we put into his hands that will do better His blacklead his brush whatever he touches will be unmasterly But my chief reason for putting a pen into his hands is that without a pen it will be difficult for him to preserve his outline and distances His touches with a pen may be unmasterly we allow but still they will preserve  keeping  in his landscape  without which the whole will be a blot of confusionNor is it perhaps so difficult to obtain some little freedom with a pen I have seen assiduity attended with but little genius make a considerable progress in the use of this instrument and produce an effect by no means displeasingIf the drawing be large I should recommend a reedpen which runs more freely over paper  When the outline is thus drawn it re∣mains to add light and shade In this ope∣ration the effect of a  wash  is much better than of lines hatched with a pen A brush will do more in one stroke and generally more effectually than a pen can do in twenty  I have seldom seen any drawings etched with a pen that pleased me The most masterly sketches in this way I ever saw were taken in the early part of the life of a gentleman now very high in his profession Mr Mitford of Lincoln's inn They were taken in several parts of Italy and England and tho they are mere memorandumsketches the subjects are so happily chosenthey are so characteristic of the countries they representand executed with so free and expressive a touch that I examined them with pleasure not only as faithful por∣traits which I believe they all are but as masterpieces as far as they go both in composition and execution  For this purpose we need only  Indian ink and perhaps a little bistre or burnt umber With the former we give that greyish tinge which belongs to the sky and distant objects and with the latter mixed more or less with Indian ink those warm touches which belong to the foreground Indian ink however alone makes a good wash both for the foreground and distance  But mere  light and shade  are not sufficient something of  effect  also should be aimed at in the  adorned sketch  Mere light and shade propose only the  simple illumination  of objects  Effect  by balancing  large masses  of each gives the whole a greater forceNow tho in the exhibitions of nature we commonly find only the  simple illumination  of objects yet as we often do meet with  grand effects  also we have sufficient authority to use them for under these circumstances we see nature in her best attire in which it is our business to describe her  As to giving rules for the production of effect the subject admits only the  most gene∣ral  There must be a strong opposition of light and shade in which the sky as well as the landscape must combine But in what  way this opposition must be variedwhere the full tone of shade must prevailwhere the full effusion of lightor where the various degrees of eachdepends intirely on the cir∣cumstance of the  composition  All you can do is to examine your drawing yet in it's naked outline with care and endeavour to find out where the force of the light will have the best effect But this depends more on  taste  than on  rule  One thing both in light and shade should be observed especially in the formerand that is  gradation  which gives a force beyond what a glaring display of light can give The effect of light which falls on the stone produced as an illustration of this idea would not be so great unless it  graduated  into shade In the following stanza Mr Gray has with great beauty and propriety illustrated the vicissitudes of life by the principles of picturesque effect  Still where rosy pleasure leads  See a kindred grief pursue  Behind the steps which misery treads  Approaching comfort view  The hues of bliss more brightly glow  Chastised by sabler tints of woe  And blended form with artful strife  The strength and harmony of life  I may farther add that the production of an  effect  is particularly necessary in  drawing  In  painting  colour in some degree makes up the deficency but in simple clairobscure there is no succedaneum It's force depends on effect the virtue of which is such that it will give a value even to a barren subject Like striking the chords of a musical instru∣ment it will produce harmony without any richness of composition  It is farther to be observed that when objects  are in shadow  the light as it is then a reflected one falls on the opposite side to that on which it falls when they are in∣lightened  In  adorning your sketch  a figure or two may be introduced with propriety By figures I mean moving objects as waggons and boats as well as cattle and men But they should be introduced sparingly In profusion they are affected Their chief use is to mark a roadto break a piece of foregroundto point out the horizon in a seaviewor to carry off the distance of retiring water by the contrast of a dark sail not quite so distant placed before it But in figures thus designed for the ornament of a sketch a few slight  touches are sufficient Attempts at finishing offend  See the preceding essay  Among trees little distinction need be made unless you introduce the pine or the cypress or some other singular form The oak the ash and the elm which bear a distant resem∣blance to each other may all be characterized alike In a sketch it is enough to mark  a tree  One distinction indeed is often necessary even in sketches and that is between fullleaved trees and those of straggling ramification In composition we have often occasion for both and therefore the hand should be used readily to execute either If we have a general idea of the oak for instance as a light tree and of the beech as a heavy one it is sufficient  It adds I think to the beauty of a sketch to stain the paper slightly with a reddish or yellowish tinge the use of which is to give a more pleasing tint to the ground of the drawing by taking away the glare of the paper It adds also if it be not too strong a degree of harmony to the rawness of black and white  This tinge may be laid on either before or after the drawing is made In general I should prefer the latter method because while the drawing is yet on white paper you may correct it with a sponge dipt in water which will in a good degree efface Indian ink But if you rub out any part  after  the drawing is stained you cannot easily lay the stain again upon the rubbed part without the appearance of a patch  Some chuse rather to add a little colour to their sketches My instructions attempt not the art of mixing a variety of tints and finishing a drawing from nature which is generally executed in colours from the begin∣ning without any use of Indian ink except as a grey tint uniting with other colours This indeed when chastly executed which is not often the case exceeds in beauty every other species of drawing It is however be∣yond my skill to give any instruction for this mode of drawing All I mean is only to offer a modest way of tinting a sketch already finish∣ed in Indian ink By the addition of a little colour I mean only to give some distinction  to objects and introduce rather a gayer stile into a landscape  When you have finished your sketch there∣fore with Indian ink as far as you propose tinge the whole over with some light horizon hue It may be the rosy tint of morning or the more ruddy one of evening or it may incline more to a yellowish or a greyish cast As a specimen an evening hue is given The first tint you spread over your drawing is composed of light red and oker which make an orange It may incline to one or the other as you chuse In this example it in∣clines rather to the former By washing this tint over your  whole drawing  you lay a foun∣dation for harmony When this wash is nearly dry repeat it in the horizon softening it off into the sky as you ascendTake next a purple tint composed of lake and blue inclining rather to the former and with this when your first wash is dry form your clouds and then spread it as you did the first tint over your  whole drawing  except where you leave the horizontint This still strengthens the idea of harmony Your sky and distance are now finished  You proceed next to your  middle  and  fore∣grounds  in both which you distinguish between the  soil  and the vegetation Wash the  middle grounds  with a little umber This will be sufficient for the  soil  The  soil  of the  fore∣ground  you may go over with a little light red The  vegetation  of each may be washed with a green composed of blue and oker adding a little more oker as you proceed nearer the eye and on the nearest grounds a little burnt terra Sienna This is sufficient for the  middle grounds  The  foreground  may farther want a little heightening both in the  soil  and  vegeta∣tion  In the  soil  it may be given in the lights with burnt terra Sienna mixing in the shadows a little lake and in the  vegetation  with gall∣stone touched in places and occasionally varied with a little burnt terra Sienna  Trees on the foreground are considered as a part of it and their foliage may be co∣loured like the vegetation in their neigh∣bourhood Their stems may be touched with burnt terra SiennaTrees in middle distances are darker than the lawns on which they stand They must therefore be touched twice over with the tint which is given only once to the lawn  If you represent clouds with bright edges the edges must be left in the first orange while the tint over the other part of the horizon is repeated as was mentioned before  A lowering cloudy sky is represented by what is called a grey tint composed of lake blue and oker As the shadow deepens the tint should incline more to blue  The several tints mentioned in the above process may perhaps the most easily be mixed before you begin especially if your drawing be large Rub the raw colours in little saucers keep them clean and distinct and from them mix your tints in other little vessels  I shall only add that the  strength of the colouring  you give your sketch must depend on the height to which you have carried the Indian ink  finishing  If it be only a slight sketch it will bear only a light wash of colour  This mode however of tinting a drawing even when you tint it as high as these instruc∣tions reach is by no means calculated to produce any great effect of colouring but it is at least sufficient to preserve harmony  This  you may preserve an  effect of colouring  you cannot easily attain It is something how∣ever  to avoid a disagreeable excess and there is nothing surely so disagreeable to a correct eye as a tinted drawing such as we often see in which greens and blues and reds and yellows are daubed without any attention to harmony It is to the picturesque eye what a discord of harsh notes is to a musical ear  But the advocate for these glaring tints may perhaps say he does not make his sky more blue than nature nor his grass and trees more green  Perhaps so but unless he could work up his drawing with the finishing of nature he will find the effect very unequal Nature mixes a variety of semitints with her brightest colours and tho the eye cannot readily sepa∣rate them they have a general chastizing effect and keep the several tints of landscape within proper bounds which a glare of deep colours cannot do Besides this chastizing hue is produced in nature by numberless little shadows beyond the attention of art which she throws on leaves and piles of grass and every other minute object all which tho not easily distinguished in  particulars  tells  in the whole  and is continually chastening the hues of nature  Before I conclude these remarks on sketch∣ing it may be useful to add a few words and but a few on perspective The nicer parts of it contain many difficulties and are of little use in common landscape but as a building now and then occurs which requires some little knowledge of perspective the subject should not be left wholly un∣touched  If a building stand exactly in front none of it's lines can go off in perspective but if it stand with a corner to the eye as picturesque buildings commonly do it's lines will appear to recede In what manner they recede the following mechanical method may explain  Hold horizontally between your eye and the building you draw a flat ruler till you see only the edge of it Where it cuts the  nearest perpendicular  of the building which you have already just traced on your paper make a  mark  and draw a slight line through that part parallel with the bottom of your paper This is called the  horizontal line  and regulates the whole perspective Observe next the angle which the uppermost of these reced∣ing  lines makes with the  nearest perpendicular  of the building and continue that receding line till it meet the  horizontal line  From the point where it intersects draw another line to the bottom of the  nearest perpendicular  This gives you the perspective of the base In the same manner all the lines which recede on both sides of the building as well above as below the  horizontal line  windows doors and projections of every kind on the same planeare regulated The points on the  horizontal line  in which these receding lines unite are called  points of sight  After all however from the mode of sketching here recommended which is as far as I should wish to recommend drawing landscape to those who draw only for amuse∣ment no great degree of accuracy can be expected General ideas only must be looked for not the peculiarities of portrait It admits the winding riverthe shooting pro∣montory the castlethe abbeythe flat dis∣tance and the mountain melting into the horizon It admits too the relation which all these parts bear to each other But it  descends not to the minutiae of objects The fringed bank of the riverthe Gothic ornaments of the abbeythe chasms and frac∣tures of the rock and castleand every little object along the vale it pretends not to delineate with exactness All this is the pro∣vince of the finished drawing and the pic∣ture in which the artist conveys an idea of each minute feature of the country he  delineates  or  imagines  But  high finishing  as I have before observed belongs only to a master who can give  expressive touches  The disciple whom I am instructing and whom I instruct only from my own experience must have humbler views and can hardly expect to please if he go farther than a sketch  adorned  as hath been here described  Many gentlemen who draw for amuse∣ment employ their leisure on human figures animal life portrait perhaps history Here and there a man of genius makes some pro∣ficiency in these difficult branches of the art but I have rarely seen any who do Dis∣torted faces and dislocated limbs I have seen in abundance and no wonder for the science of anatomy  even  as it regards painting is with difficulty attained and few who have  studied it their whole lives have acquired perfection  Others again who draw for amusement go so far as to handle the pallet But in this the success of the illjudging artist seldom answers his hopes unless utterly void of taste he happen to be such an artist as may be ad∣dressed in the sarcasm of the critic  Sine rivali teque et tua solus amares  Painting is both a science and an art and if so very few attain perfection who spend a lifetime on it what can be expected from those who spend only their leisure The very few gentlemenartists who excel in  paint∣ing  scarce afford encouragement for common practice  But the  art of sketching landscape  is attainable by a man of business and it is certainly more useful and I should imagine more amusing to attain  some degree  of excellence in an in∣ferior branch than to be a mere bungler in a superior Even if you should not excel in  execution  which indeed you can hardly ex∣pect you may at least by bringing home the delineation of a fine country dignify an in∣different  sketch You may please yourself by administring strongly to recollection and you may please others by conveying your ideas more distinctly in an ordinary sketch than in the best language  THE END  CONTENTS OF THE FOLLOWING POEM  Line INTRODUCTION and address  Line A close attention to the various scenes of nature recommended and to the se∣veral circumstances under which they appear  Line A facility also in copying the different  parts  of nature should be attained before the young artist attempts a  whole  Line This process will also be a kind of  test  No one can make any progress whose ima∣gination is not fired with the scenes of nature  Line On a supposition that the artist is enamoured with his subject and is well versed in copying the parts of nature he begins  to combine and form those parts into the subjects of landscape He pays his first attention to  design  or to the bringing together of such objects as are suited to his subject not mixing trivial objects with grand scenes but preserving the  character  of his subject whatever it may be  Line The different parts of his landscape must next be studiously arranged and put together in a picturesque manner This is the work of  disposition  or as it is sometimes called  composition  No rules can be given for this arrangement but the experience of a nice eye for tho nature seldom presents a compleat composition yet we every where see in her works beautiful arrangements of parts which we ought to study with great attention  Line In general a landscape is composed of three partsa foregrounda middle ground and a distance  Line Yet this is not a universal rule A  balance of parts  however there should always be tho sometimes those parts may be few  Line It is a great error in landscapepainters to lose the  simplicity  of a whole under the idea of giving  variety  Line Some  particular scene  therefore or  leading subject  should always be chosen to which the parts should be subservient  Line In balancing a landscape a spacious fore∣ground will admit a small thread of dis∣tance but the reverse is a bad propor∣tion In every landscape there  must  be a considerable foreground  Line This theory is illustrated by the view of a  disproportioned distance  Line An objection answered why vast distances tho unsupported by foregrounds may please  in nature  and yet offend  in repre∣sentation  Line But tho the several parts of landscape may be  well ballanced  and adjusted yet still without  contrast in the parts  there will be a great deficiency At the same time this contrast must be easy and natural  Line Such pictures as are painted from fancy are the most pleasing efforts of genius But if an untoward subject be given the artist must endeavour to conceal and vary the unaccommodating parts The foreground he  must  claim as his own  Line But if nature be the source of all beauty it may be objected that imaginary views can have little merit The objection has weight if the imaginary view be not  formed from the selected parts of nature but if it be it is nature still  Line The artist having thus adjusted his forms and disposition conceives next the best effect of light and when he has thus laid the foundation of his picture proceeds to colouring  Line The author avoids giving rules for colouring which are learned chiefly by practice  Line He just touches on the theory of colours  Line Artists with equally good effect sometimes blend them on their pallet and some∣times spread them raw on their canvas  Line In colouring the sky gives the ruling tint to the landscape and the hue of the whole whether rich or sober must be harmo∣nious  Line A predominancy of shade has the best effect  Line But light tho it should not be scattered should not be collected as it were into a focus  Line The effect of  gradation  illustrated by the co∣louring of cattle  Line Of the disposition of light  Line Of the  general harmony  of the whole  Line A method proposed of examining a picture with regard to it's  general harmony  Line The scientific part being closed all that can be said with regard to  execution  is that as there are various modes of it every  artist ought to adopt his own or else he becomes a servile imitator On the whole the bold free method recommended which aims at giving the  character  of objects rather than the  minute detail  Line Rules given with regard to figures History in miniature introduced in landscape condemned Figures should be suited to the scene  Line Rules to be observed in the introduction of birds  Line An exhibition is the truest test of excellence where the picture receives it's stamp and value not from the airs of coxcombs but from the judgment of men of taste and science  ON LANDSCAPE PAINTING A POEM  ON LANDSCAPE PAINTING  A POEM  THAT Art which gives the practis'd pencil pow'r  To rival Nature's graces to combine  In one harmonious whole her scatter'd charms  And o'er them fling appropriate force of light  I sing unskill'd in numbers yet a Muse  Led by the hand of Friendship deigns to lend  Her aid and give that free colloquial flow  Which best befits the plain preceptive song  To thee thus aided let me dare to sing  Judicious LOCKE who from great Nature's realms  Hast cull'd her loveliest features and arrang'd  In thy rich mem'ry's storehouse Thou whose glance  Practis'd in truth and symmetry can trace  In every latent touch each Master's hand  Whether the marble by his art subdued  Be soften'd into life or canvas smooth  Be swell'd to animation Thou to whom  Each mode of landscape beauteous or sublime  With every various colour tint and light  Its nice gradations and its bold effects  Are all familiar patient hear my song  That to thy taste and science nothing new  Presents yet humbly hopes from thee to gain  The plaudit which if Nature first approve  Then and then only thou wilt deign to yield  First to the youthful artist I address  This leading precept Let not inborn pride  Presuming on thy own inventive powers  Mislead thine eye from Nature She must reign  Great architype in all Trace then with care  Her varied walks observe how she upheaves  The mountain's tow'ring brow on its rough sides  How broad the shadow falls what different hues  Invest its glimm'ring surface Next survey  The distant lake so seen a shining spot  But when approaching nearer how it flings  Its sweeping curves around the shooting cliffs  Mark every shade its Proteus shape assumes  From motion and from rest and how the forms  Of tufted woods and beetling rocks and tow'rs  Of ruin'd castles from the smooth expanse  Shade answ'ring shade inverted meet the eye  From mountains hie thee to the forestscene  Remark the form the foliage of each tree  And what its leading feature View the oak  Its massy limbs its majesty of shade  The pendent birch the beech of many a stem  The lighter ash and all their changeful hues  In spring or autumn russet green or grey  Next wander by the river's mazy bank  See where it dimpling glides or briskly where  Its whirling eddies sparkle round the rock  Or where with headlong rage it dashes down  Some fractur'd chasm till all its fury spent  It sinks to sleep a silent stagnant pool  Dark tho' translucent from the mantling shade  Now give thy view more ample range explore  The vast expanse of ocean see when calm  What Irishues of purple green and gold  Play on its glassy surface and when vext  With storms what depth of billowy shade with light  Of curling foam contrasted View the cliffs  The lonely beacon and the distant coast  In mists array'd just heaving into sight  Above the dim horizon where the sail  Appears conspicuous in the lengthen'd gleam  With studious eye examine next the arch  Etherial mark each sloating cloud its form  Its varied colour and what mass of shade  It gives the scene below pregnant with change  Perpetual from the morning's purple dawn  Till the last glimm'ring ray of russet eve  Mark how the sunbeam steep'd in morningdew  Beneath each jutting promontory flings  A darker shade while brighten'd with the ray  Of sultry noon not yet entirely quench'd  The eveningshadow less opaquely falls  Thus stor'd with fair ideas call them forth  By practice till thy ready pencil trace  Each form familiar but attempt not thou  A  whole  till every  part  be well conceived  The tongue that awes a senate with its force  Once lisp'd in syllables or e'er it pour'd  Its glowing periods warm with patriotfire  At length matur'd stand forth for honest Fame  A candidate Some noble theme select  From Nature's choicest scenes and sketch that theme  With firm but easy line then if my song  Assist thy pow'r it asks no nobler meed  Yet if when Nature's sov'reign glories meet  Thy sudden glance no corresponding spark  Of vivid flame be kindled in thy breast  If calmly thou canst view them know for thee  My numbers flow not seek some fitter guide  To lead thee where the low mechanic toils  With patient labour for his daily hire  But if true Genius fire thee if thy heart  Glow palpitate with transport at the fight  If emulation seize thee to transfuse  These splendid visions on thy vivid chart  If the big thought seem more than Art can paint  Haste snatch thy pencil bounteous Nature yields  To thee her choicest stores and the glad Muse  Sits by assistant aiming but to fan  The Promethèan flame conscious her rules  Can only guide not give the warmth divine  First learn with  objects suited to each scene  Thy landscape to adorn If some rude view  Thy pencil culls of lake or mountain range  Where Nature walks with proud majestic step  Give not her robe the formal folds of art  But bid it flow with ample dignity  Mix not the mean and trivial Is the  whole  Sublime let each accordant  part  be grand  Yet if thro' dire necessity for that  Alone should force the deed some polish'd scene  Employ thy pallet dress'd by human art  The lawn so level and the bank so trim  Yet still  preserve thy subject  Let the oak  Be elegant of form that mantles o'er  Thy shaven foreground The rough forester  Whose peel'd and wither'd boughs and knarled trunk  Have stood the rage of many a winter's blast  Might ill such cultur'd scenes adorn Not less  Would an old Briton rough with martial scars  And bearing stern defiance on his brow  Seem fitly stationed at a Gallic feast  This choice of  objects suited to the scene  We name DESIGN A choice not more requir'd  From RAFFAEL than from thee whether his hand  Give all but motion to some group divine  Or thine inglorious picture woods and streams  With equal rigour DISPOSITION claims  Thy close attention Would'st thou learn its laws  Examine Nature when combin'd with art  Or simple mark how various are her forms  Mountains enormous rugged rocks clear lakes  Castles and bridges aqueducts and fanes  Of these observe how some united please  While others illcombin'd disgust the eye  That principle which rules these various parts  And harmonizing  all  produces  one  Is  Disposition  By its plastic pow'r  Those rough materials which  Design  selects  Are nicely balanc'd Thus with friendly aid  These principles unite  Design  presents  The gen'ral subject  disposition  culls  And recombines the various forms anew  Yet here true Taste to three distinguish'd parts  Confines her aim Brought nearest to the eye  She forms her foregrounds then the midway space  E'er the blue distance melt in liquid air  But tho' full oft these parts with blending tints  Are soften'd so as wakes a frequent doubt  Where each begins where ends yet still she keeps  A  gen'ral balance  So when Europe's sons  Sound the alarm of war some potent hand  Now thine again my Albion poises true  The scale of empire curbs each rival pow'r  And checks each lawless tyrant's wild career  Not but there are of fewer parts who plan  A pleasing picture These a forestglade  Suffices oft behind which just remov'd  One tuft of foliage WATERLO like thine  Gives all we wish of dear variety  For ev'n variety itself may pall  If to the eye when pausing with delight  On one fair object it presents a mass  Of many which disturb that eye's repose  All hail Simplicity To thy chaste shrine  Beyond all other let the artist bow  Oft have I seen arrang'd by hands that well  Could pencil Nature's  parts  landscapes that knew  No  leading subject  Here a forest rose  A river there ran dimpling and beyond  The portion of a lake while rocks and tow'rs  And castles intermix'd spread o'er the whole  In multiform confusion Ancient dames  Thus oft compose of various silken shreds  Some gaudy patch'd unmeaning tawdry thing  Where bucks and cherries ships and flow'rs unite  In one rich compound of absurdity  Chuse then some  principal commanding theme  Be it lake valley winding stream cascade  Castle or seaport and on  that  exhaust  Thy pow'rs and make to that all else conform  Who paints a landscape is confin'd by rules  As fix'd and rigid as the tragic bard  To  unity of subject  Is the scene  A forest nothing there save woods and lawns  Must rise conspicuous Episodes of hills  And lakes be far remov'd all that obtrudes  On the chief theme how beautiful soe'er  Seen as a  part  disgusts us in the  whole  Thus in the realms of landscape to preserve  Proportion  just is  Disposition's  task  And tho' a glance of distance it allows  Ev'n when the foreground swells upon the sight  Yet if the distant scen'ry wide extend  The foreground must be ample Take free scope  Art must have space to stand on like the Sage  Who boasted pow'r to shake the solid globe  This thou must claim and if thy distance spread  Profuse must claim it amply Uncombin'd  With foreground distance loses pow'r to please  Where rising from the solid rock appear  Those ancient battlements there liv'd a knight  That oft surveying from his castle wall  The wide expanse before him distance vast  Interminable wilds savannahs deep  Dark woods and village spires and glitt'ring streams  Just twinkling in the sunbeam wish'd the view  Transferrd' to canvass and for that sage end  Led some obedient son of Art to where  His own unerring taste had previous fix'd  The point of amplest prospect "Take thy stand  "Just here" he cry'd "and paint me  all  thou seest  "Omit no single object" It was done  And soon the livelong landscape cloaths his hall  And spreads from base to ceiling  All  was there  As to his guests while dinner cool'd the knight  Full oft would prove and with uplifted cane  Point to the distant spire where slept entomb'd  His ancestry beyond where lay the town  Skirted with wood that gave him place and voice  In Britain's senate nor untrac'd the stream  That fed the goodly trout they soon should taste  Nor ev'ry scatter'd seat of friend or foe  He calls his neighbours Heedless he meanwhile  That what he deems the triumph of his taste  Is but a painted survey a mere map  Which light and shade and perspective misplac'd  But serve to spoil  Yet why methinks I hear  Some Critic say do ample scenes like this  In  picture  fail to please when ev'ry eye  Confesses they transport on  Nature's chart  Why but because where she displays the scene  The roving sight can pause and swift select  From all she offers parts whereon to six  And form distinct perceptions each of these  Producing  sep'rate pictures  and as bees  Condense within their hives the varying sweets  So does the eye a  lovely whole  collect  From  parts disjointed  nay perhaps  deform'd  Then deem not Art defective which divides  Rejects or recombines but rather say  'Tis her chief excellence There is we know  A charm unspeakable in converse free  Of lover or of friend when soul with soul  Mixes in social intercourse when choice  Of phrase and rules of rhet'ric are disdained  Yet say adopted by the tragic bard  If Jaffier thus with Belvidera talk'd  So vague so rudely would not want of skill  Selection and arrangement damn the scene  Thy forms tho'  balanc'd  still perchance may want  The charm of  Contrast  Sing we then its pow'r  'Tis Beauty's surest source it regulates  Shape colour light and shade forms ev'ry line  By  opposition just  whate'er is  rough  With skill delusive counteracts by  smooth  Sinuous  or  concave  by its opposite  Yet ever  covertly  should  Art appear  That art were  Affectation  Then alone  We own the power of  Contrast  when the lines  Unite with Nature's freedom then alone  When from its careless touch each part receives  A pleasing form The lake's contracted bounds  By contrast varied elegantly flow  Th' unwieldy mountain sinks here to remove  Offensive parallels the hill deprest  Is lifted there the heavy beech expung'd  Gives place to airy pines if two bare knolls  Rise to the right and left a castle here  And there a wood diversify their form  Thrice happy he who always can indulge  This pleasing feast of fancy who replete  With rich ideas can arrange their charms  As his own genius prompts and plan and paint  A novel whole But tasteless wealth oft claims  The  faithful portrait  and will fix the scene  Where Nature's lines run falsely or refuse  To harmonize Artist if thus employ'd  I pity thy mischance Yet there are means  Ev'n here to hide defects The human form  Pourtray'd by Reynolds oft abounds with grace  He saw not in his model which nor hurts  Resemblance nor fictitious skill betrays  Why then if o'er the limb uncouth he flings  The flowing vest may not thy honest art  Veil with the foliage of some spreading tree  Unpleasing objects or remote or near  An ample licence for such needful change  The foregrounds give thee There both mend and make▪  Whoe'er opposes tell them 'tis the spot  Where fancy needs must sport where if restrain'd  To close resemblance thy best art expires  What if they plead that from thy gen'ral rule  That rests on Nature as the only source  Of beauty thou revolt'st tell them that rule  Thou hold'st still sacred Nature  is  its source  Yet Nature's  parts  fail to receive alike  The fair impression View her varied range  Each form that charms is there yet her best forms  Must be  selected  As the sculptur'd charms  Of the fam'd Venus grew so must thou cull  From various scenes such parts as best create  One perfect whole If Nature ne'er array'd  Her most accomplish'd work with grace compleat  Think will she waste on desert rocks and dells  What she denies to Woman's charming form  And now if on review thy chalk'd  design  Brought into form by  Disposition's  aid  Displease not trace thy lines with pencil free  Add lightly too that  general mass  of shade  Which suits the form and fashion of its parts  There are who studious of the best effects  First sketch a slight cartoon Such previous care  Is needful where the Artist's fancy fails  Precisely to foresee the future whole  This done prepare thy pallet mix thy tints  And call on chaste Simplicity again  To save her votary from whate'ever of hue  Discordant or abrupt may flaunt or glare  Yet here to bring materials from the mine  From animal or vegetable dies  And sing their various properties and pow'rs  The Muse descends not To mechanic rules  To prose and practice which can only teach  The use of pigments she resigns the toil  One truth she gives that Nature's simple loom  Weaves but with three distinct or mingled hues  The vest that cloaths Creation These are red  Azure and yellow Pure and unstain'd white  If colour deem'd rejects her gen'ral law  And is by her rejected Dost thou deem  The glossy surface of yon heifer's coat  A perfect white Or yon vast heaving cloud  That climbs the distant hill With ceruse bright  Attempt to catch its tint and thou wilt fail  Some tinge of purple or some yellowish brown  Must first be blended e'er thy toil succeed  Pure white great Nature wishes to expunge  From all her works and only then admits  When with her mantle broad of fleecy snow  She wraps them to secure from chilling frost  Conscious mean while that what she gives to guard  Conceals their ev'ry charm the stole of night  Not more eclipses yet that sable stole  May by the skilful mixture of these hues  Be shadow'd ev'n to dark Cimmerian gloom  Draw then from these as from three plenteous springs  Thy brown thy purple crimson orange green  Nor load thy pallet with a useless tribe  Of pigments when commix'd with needful white  As suits thy end these native three suffice  But if thou dost still cautious keep in view  That harmony which these alone can give  Yet still there are who scorning all the rules  Of dull mechanic art with random hand  Fling their unblended colours and produce  Bolder effects by opposition's aid  The Sky whate'er its hue to landscape gives  A correspondent tinge The morning ray  Spreads it with purple light in dewdrops steep'd  The evening fires it with a crimson glow  Blows the bleak North It sheds a cold blue tint  On all it touches Do light mists prevail  A soft grey hue o'erspreads the gen'ral scene  And makes that scene like beauty view'd thro' gauze  More delicately lovely Chuse thy sky  But let that sky whate'er the tint it takes  O'errule thy pallet Frequent have I seen  In landscapes well composed aerial hues  So illpreserv'd that whether cold or heat  Tempest or calm prevail'd was dubious all  Not so thy pencil CLAUDE the season marks  Thou mak'st us pant beneath thy summer noon  And shiver in thy cool autumnal eve  Such are the pow'rs of sky and therefore Art  Selects what best is suited to the scenes  It means to form to this adapts a morn  To that an ev'ning ray Light mists full oft  Give mountainviews an added dignity  While tame impoverish'd scenery claims the force  Of splendid lights and shades nor claims in vain  Thy sky adjusted all that is  remote  First colour faintly leaving to the last  Thy foreground Easier 'tis thou know'st to spread  Thy floating foliage o'er the sky than mix  That sky amid the branches Venture still  On warmer tints as distances approach  Nearer the eye nor fear the richest hues  If to those hues thou giv'st the meet support  Of strong opposing shade A canvas once  I saw on which the Artist dar'd to paint  A scene in Indostan where gold and pearl  Barbaric flam'd on many a broider'd vest  Profusely splendid yet chaste Art was there  Opposing hue to hue each shadow deep  So spread that all with sweet accord produc'd  A bright yet modest whole Thus blend thy tints  Be they of scarlet orange green or gold  Harmonious till one gen'ral glow prevail  Unbroken by abrupt and hostile glare  Let shade predominate it makes each light  More lucid yet destroys offensive glare  Mark when in fleecy show'rs of snow the clouds  Seem to descend and whiten o'er the land  What unsubstantial unity of tinge  Involves each prospect Vision is absorb'd  Or wand'ring thro' the void finds not a point  To rest on All is mockery to the eye  Thus light diffus'd debases that effect  Which shade improves Behold what glorious scenes  Arise thro' Nature's works from shade Yon lake  With all its circumambient woods far less  Would charm the eye did not the dusky mist  Creeping along its eastern shores ascend  Those tow'ring cliffs mix with the ruddy beam  Of opening day just damp its fires and spread  O'er all the scene a sweet obscurity  But would'st thou see the full effect of shade  Well mass'd at eve mark that upheaving cloud  Which charg'd with all th' artillery of Jove  In awful darkness marching from the east  Ascends see how it blots the sky and spreads  Darker and darker still its dusky veil  Till from the east to west the cope of heav'n  It curtains closely round Haply thou stand'st  Expectant of the loud convulsive burst  When lo the sun just sinking in the west  Pours from th' horizon's verge a splendid ray  Which tenfold grandeur to the darkness adds  Far to the east the radiance shoots just tips  Those tufted groves but all its splendour pours  On yonder castled cliff which chiefly owes  Its glory and supreme effect to shade  Thus light inforc'd by shadow spreads a ray  Still brighter Yet forbid that light to shine  A glitt'ring speck for this were to illume  Thy picture as the convex glass collects  All to one dazzling point the solar rays  Whate'er the force of  opposition  still  In soft  gradation  equal beauty lies  When the mild lustre glides from light to dark  The eye wellpleas'd pursues it 'Mid the herds  Of variegated hue that graze our lawns  Oft may the Artist trace examples just  Of this sedate effect and oft remark  Its opposite Behold yon lordly Bull  His sable head his lighter shoulders ting'd  With flakes of brown at length still lighter tints  Prevailing graduate o'er his flank and loins  In tawny orange What if on his front  A star of white appear The general mass  Of colour spreads unbroken and the mark  Gives his stern front peculiar character  Ah how degenerate from her wellcloath'd sire  That heifer See her sides with white and black  So studded so distinct each justling each  The groundworkcolour hardly can be known  Of lights if more than two thy landscape boast  It boasts too much But if two lights be there  Give one preeminence with that be sure  Illume thy  foreground  or thy  midway space  But rarely spread it on the  distant scene  Yet there if level plains or fens appear  And meet the sky a lengthen'd gleam of light  Discreetly thrown will vary the flat scene  But if that distance be abruptly clos'd  By mountains cast them into total shade  Ill suit gay robes their hoary majesty  Sober be all their hues

burning sands  If rocky wild and awful be thy views  Low arts of husbandry exclude The spade  The plough the patient angler with his rod  Be banish'd thence far other guests invite  Wild as those

effects  Approve thy landscape if judicious LOCKE  See not an error he would wish remov'd  Then boldly deem thyself the heir of Fame  NOTES ON THE FOREGOING POEM  Line SOME perhaps may object to the word  glimmering  but whoever has observed the playing lights and colours which often invest the summits of mountains will not think the epithet improper  Line  What it's leading feature  that is the  par∣ticular character  of the tree The dif∣ferent shape of the leaves and the dif∣ferent mode of spreading it's branches give every tree a  distinct form  or  character  At a little distance you easily distinguish the oak from the ash and the ash from the beech It is this  general form  not any  particular detail  which the artist is instructed to get by heart The same remark holds with  regard to other parts of nature These  general forms  may be called the  painter's alphabet  By these he learns to read her works and also to make them intelli∣gible to others  Line  With light of curling foam contrasted  The progress of each wave is this Beneath the frothy curl when it rises between the eye and the light the colour is pale green which brightens from the base towards the summit When a wave subsides the summit falling into the base extends and raises it and the sides running off from the centre that part of the water which meets the suc∣ceeding wave springs upward from the shock the top forms into foam and rolling over falls down the side which has been shocked presenting if the water be much agitated the idea of a cascade  Line  The eveningshadow less opaquely falls  It is not often observed by landscapepainters tho it certainly deserves observation that the morningshadows are darker than those of the evening  Line  If the big thought seem more than art can paint  It is always a sign of genius to be dis∣satisfied with our own efforts and to conceive more than we can express  Line  Design presents the general subject disposition  c Some writers on the art of painting have varied this division But it seems most proper I think to give the se∣lection of the elements of landscape the assembling of rocks mountains ca∣taracts and other objects to  design  while  disposition  is properly employed in the local arrangement of them  Line The  general  composition of a landscape con∣sists of three partsthe foregroundthe second groundand the distance No rule can be given for proportioning these parts to each other There are ten thousand beautiful proportions from which the eye of taste must select a good one The foreground must always be considerablein some cases ample It is the very basis and foundation of the wholeNor is it a bad rule I think that some part of the foreground should be the highest part of the picture In rocky and mountainous views this is easy and has generally a good effect And sometimes even when a country is more level a tree on the foreground carried higher than the rest of the land∣scape answers the end At the same time in many species of landscape this  rule cannot easily be adapted nor is it by any means essential  Line  Waterlo like thine  The subjects of this master seldom went beyond some little forestview He has etched a great num∣ber of prints in this stile of landscape which for the beauty of the trees in par∣ticular are much admired  Line  Landscapes that knew no leading subject  There is not a rule in landscapepainting more neglected or that ought more to be ob∣served than what relates to a  leadingsubject  By the leading subject we mean what  characterizes the scene  We often see a landscape which comes under no denomination Is it the scenery about a ruin Is it a lakescene Is it a riverscene No but it is a jumble of all together Some leading subject there∣fore is required in every landscape which forms it's character and to which the painter  is confined by rules  As fixed and rigid as the tragic bard  when the landscape takes it's character from a ruin or other object on the foreground the  distance  introduced is merely an ap∣pendage and must plainly appear to be an underpart not interfering with the  subject of the piece But most commonly the scene or leadingsubject of the pic∣ture occupies the middle distance In this case the  foreground  becomes the appendage and without any striking object to attract the eye must plainly shew that it is intended only to intro∣duce the leadingsubject with more ad∣vantage  Line Thus in a forestscene the woods and lawns are the leadingsubject If the piece will admit it a hill or a lake may be admit∣ted in  remote distance  but they must be introduced only as the episodes in a poem to set off the main subject They must not interfere with it but be  far removed  Line  And tho a glance  It is certain in fact that a considerable foreground with a glance of distance will make a better picture than a wide distance set off only with a meagre foreground and yet I doubt whether an adequate reason can be given unless it be founded on what hath already been advanced that we consider the fore∣ground as the  basis and foundation of the whole picture  So that if it is not consi∣derable in all circumstances and extensive in some there seems a defect  Line  A novel whole  The imaginaryview formed on a judicious selection and arrangement of the parts of nature has a better chance of making a good picture than a view taken in the whole from any natural scene Not only the lines and objects of the na∣tural scene rarely admit a happy composi∣tion but the  character  of it is seldom throughout preserved Whether it be  su∣blime  or  beautiful  there is generally some∣thing mixed with it of a nature unsuitable to it All this the exhibition of fancy rec∣tifies when in the hands of a master Nor does he claim any thing but what the poet and he are equally allowed Where is the story in real life on which the poet can form either an epic or a drama unless heightened by his imagina∣tion At the same time he must take care that all his imaginary additions are founded in nature or his work will dis∣gust Such also must be the painter's care But under this restriction he cer∣tainly may bring together a more  consistent whole  culled from the  various parts  of nature than nature herself exhibits in  any one scene  Line  Trace thy lines with pencil free  The master is discovered even in his chalk or blacklead linesso free firm and intelligent  We often admire these first rude touches The story of the two old masters will be remembred who left cards of compli∣ments to each other on which only the simple outline of a figure was drawn by one and corrected by the other but with such a superior elegance in each that the signature of names could not have marked them more decisively  Line  First sketch a slight cartoon  It is the practice indeed of the generality of painters when they have any great design to execute to make a slight sketch sometimes on paper and sometimes on canvas And these sketches are often greatly superior to the principal picture which has been laboured and finished with the exactest care King William on horseback at Hampton court by sir Godfrey Kneller is a striking example of this remark The picture is highly finished but is a tame and unmasterly performance At Houghtonhall I have seen the original sketch of this picture which I should have valued not only greatly beyond the picture itself but beyond any thing I ever saw from the pencil of sir Godfrey  Line  One truth she gives  c From these three virgin colours  red blue  and  yellow  all the tints of nature are composed Greens  of various hues are composed of blue and yellow orange of red and yellow purple and violet of red and blue The tints of the rainbow seem to be composed also of these colours They lie in order thus violet  red  orange  yellow  green  blue  violet  red  in which assortment we observe that orange comes between  red  and  yellow  that is it is composed of those colours melting into each other Green is in the same way composed of  yellow  and  blue  and violet or purple of  blue  and  red  Nay even browns of all kinds may in a degree be effected by a mixture of these original colours so may grey and even a kind of black tho not a perfect oneAs all pigments how∣ever are deficient and cannot approach the rainbow colours which are the purest we know the painter must often even in his splendid tints call in different reds blues and yellows Thus as vermilion tho an excellent red on many occasions cannot give the rosy crimson hue he must often call in lake Nor will he find any yellow or blue that will answer every purpose In the tribe of browns he will be still more at a loss and must have recourse to different earthsIn oilpainting one of the finest earths is known  at the colourshops by the name of  castleearth  or  Vandyke'sbrown  as it is supposed to have been used by that master  Line  And is by her rejected  Scarce any natural object but snow is purely white The chalkcliff is generally in a degree disco∣loured The petals of the snowdrop indeed and of some other flowers are purely white but seldom any of the larger parts of nature  Line  Keep in view that harmony  c Tho it will be necessary to use other colours besides  yellow red  and  blue  this union should however still be kept in view as the leading principle of harmony A mix∣ture indeed of these three will produce nearly the colour you want but the more colours are mixed the muddier they grow It will give more clearness therefore and brightness to your colouring to use simple pigments of which there are great abun∣dance in the painter's dispensatory  Line This mode of colouring is the most difficult to attain as it is the most scientific It includes a perfect knowledge of the effects of colours in all their various agreements and oppositions When attained it is the most easy in practice The artist who blends his colours on his pallet depends more on his eye than on his  knowledge He works out his effect by a more laboured process and yet he may produce a good picture in the end  Line Nobody was better acquainted with the effects of sky nor studied them with more at∣tention than the younger Vanderveldt Not many years ago an old Thameswa∣terman was alive who remembred him well and had often carried him out in his boat both up and down the river to study the appearances of the sky The old man used to say they went out in all kinds of weather fair and foul and Mr Vanderveldt took with him large sheets of blue paper which he would mark all over with black and white The artist easily sees the intention of this process These expeditions Vanderveldt called in his Dutch manner of speaking  going a skoying  Line The most remarkable instance of ingenious colouring I ever heard of is in Guido's St Michael The whole picture is com∣posed of blue red and black by means of which colours the ideas of heaven and hell are blended together in a very extra∣ordinary manner and the effect exceed∣ingly sublime while both harmony and chasteness are preserved in the highest degree  Line  Let shade predominate  As a  general rule  the halftints should have more extent than the lights and the shadows should equal both put togetherYet why a predo∣minancy of shade should please the eye more than a predominancy of light would perhaps be difficult to explain I can easily conceive that a  balance  of light and shade may be founded in some kind of reason but am at a loss to give a reason for a predominancy of either The fact however is undoubted and we must skreen our ignorance of the principle as well as we can  Line This rule respects an  affected display of light  If it be introduced as a focus so as not to fall  naturally  on the several objects it touches it disgusts Rembrandt I doubt is sometimes chargeable with this fault He is commonly supposed to be a master of this part of painting and we often see very beautiful lights in his pictures and prints but as in many of them we see the reverse he appears to have had no fixed principle Indeed few parts of painting are so much neglected so easily transgressed and so little understood as the distribution of light  Line  Opposition  and  gradation  are the two grand means of producing effect by light In  the picture just given l c of the eveningray the effect is produced by  opposition  Beautiful effects too of the same kind arise often from  catching lights  The power of producing effect by  gradation  is not less forcible Indeed without a degree of  gradation opposition  itself would be mute In the picture just given of the eveningray the grand part of the effect no doubt arises from the  opposition  between the gloom and the light but in part it arises also from the  gradation  of the light till it reach it's point It just tips  The tufted groves but all it's splendor pours  On yonder castled cliff  Line The colours of animals often strongly illustrate the idea of  gradation  When they soften into each other from light to dark or from one colour into another the mixture is very picturesque It is as much the reverse when white and black or white and red are patched over the animal in blotches without any intermediate tints Domestic cattle cows dogs swine goats and cats are often disagreeably patched tho we sometimes see them pleasingly coloured with a graduating tint Wild animals in general are more uniformly  coloured than tame Except the zebra and two or three of the spotted race I recollect none which are not more or less tinted in this graduating manner The tiger the panther and other varie∣gated animals have their beauty but the zebra I think is rather a curious than a picturesque animal It's streaked sides injure it both in point of colour and in the delineation of it's form  Line  But rarely spread it on the distant scene  In general perhaps a landscape is best in∣lightened when the light falls on the middle parts of the picture and the foreground is in shadow This throws a kind of natural retiring hue throughout the landscape and tho the  distance be in shadow  yet that shadow is so faint that the retiring hue is still preserved This however is only a general rule In histo∣rypainting the light is properly thrown upon the figures on the foreground which are the  capital part  of the picture In landscape the middle grounds commonly form  the scene  or the  capital part  and the foreground is litttle more than an appendage Sometimes however it hap∣pens that a ruin or some other capital object on the foreground makes the  prin∣cipal part of the scene  When that is the  case it should be distinguished by light unless it be so situated as to receive more distinction from shade  Line  A fiercer splendor opens to our view all his terrific features  It is very amusing in mountainous countries to observe the appearance which the same mountain often makes under different circumstan∣ces When it is invested with light mists or even when it is not illumined we see it's whole summit perhaps under one grey tint But as it receives the sun especially an eveningsun we see a va∣riety of fractures and chasms gradually opening of which we discovered not the least appearance before  Line Tho the objects may lessen in due proportion which is called  keeping  tho the gra∣duating hue of retiring objects or the  aerial perspective  may be just and tho the light may be distributed according to the rules of art yet still there may not be that general result of harmony which denotes the picture  one object  and as the eye may be misled when it has the  several parts  before it the best way of examining it as a  perfect whole  is to examine it in such a light as will not admit the investigation of  parts  Line  Others  c Some painters copy exactly what they see In this there is more mechani∣cal precision than genius Others take a  general comprehensive view  of their ob∣ject and marking just the  characteristic points  lead the spectator if he be a man of taste and genius likewise into a truer knowledge of it than the copier can do with all his painful exactness  Line  Why then degrade  c If by bringing the figures forward on the foreground you give room for  character  and  expression  you put them out of place as  appendages  for which they were intended  Line  Oft slowly winding  c The machine itself here described is picturesque and when it is seen in  winding motion  or in other words when half of it is seen in per∣spective it receives additional beauty from contrast In the same manner a cavalcade or an army on it's march may be considered as  one object  and derive beauty from the same source Mr Gray has given us a very picturesque view of this kind in describing the march of Edward I  As down the steep of Snowdon's shaggy side  He wound with toilsome march his long array  Stout Gloucester stood aghast in speechless trance  To arms cried Mortimer and couched his quivering lance  Through a passage in the mountain we see the troops winding round at a great distance Among those nearer the eye we distinguish the horse and foot and on the foreground the action and ex∣pression of the principal commanders The ancients seem to have known very little of that source of the picturesque which arises from perspective every thing is in∣troduced in front before the eye and among the early painters we see very lit∣tle more attention paid to it Raphael is far from making a full use of the know∣ledge of it and I believe Julio Romano makes still less I do not remember meeting any where with a more picturesque description of a line of march than in Vaillant's travels into the interior parts of Africa He was passing with a numerous caravan along the borders of Caffraria I first says he made the people of the hord which accompanied me set out with their cat∣tle and a little after my cattle followed cows sheep and goats with all the women of the hord mounted on oxen with their children My waggons with the rest of my people closed the rear I myself mounted on horseback rode backwards and forewards This caravan  on it's march exhibited often a singu∣lar and amusing spectacle The turns it was obliged to make in following the windings of the woods and rocks con∣tinually gave it new forms Sometimes it intirely disappeared then suddenly at a distance from the summit of a hill I again discovered my vanguard slowly ad∣vancing perhaps towards a distant moun∣tain while the main body following the track were just below me  Line This rule indeed applies to all other objects but as the ship is so large a machine and at the same time so complicated a one it's  character  is less obvious than that of most other objects It is much better therefore where a vessel is neces∣sary to put in a few touches for a skiff than to insert some disagreeable form for a ship to which it has no Resemblance At the same time it is not at all neces∣sary to make your ship so accurate that a seaman could find no fault with it It is the same in figures as appendages of landscape there is no necessity to have them exactly accurate but if they have not the  general form  and  character  of what they represent the landscape is better without them  Line  They seem  c  Rapid motion  alone and that  near the eye  is here censured We should be careful not to narrow too much the circumscribed sphere of art There is an art of seeing as well as of painting The eye must in part enter into the deception The art of painting must in some degree be considered as an act of convention General forms only are imi∣tated and much is to be supplied by the imagination of the spectatorIt is thus in drama How absurdly would the spectator act if instead of assisting the illusion of the stage he should insist on being deceived without being a party in the deceptionif he refused to believe that the light he saw was the sun or the scene before him the Roman ca∣pital because he knew the one was a candlelight and the other a painted cloth The painter therefore must in  many things  suppose deception and only avoid it where it is too  palpably gross  for the eye to suffer  Line Guido's air no doubt is often very pleasing He is thought to have excelled in ima∣gining the angelic character and as if aware of this superiority was fond of painting angels After all however they whose taste is formed on the simplicity  of the antique think  Guido's air  in ge∣neral somewhat theatrical  Line  Skilful they  c The greatest obstruction to the progress of art arises from the pre∣judices of conceited judges who in fact know less about the matter than they who know nothing inasmuch as truth is less obvious to error than it is to ignorance Till they can be prevailed on to return upon their steps and look for that criterion in nature which they seek in the halfperished works of great names the painter will be discouraged from pursuing knowledge in those paths where Raphael and Titian found it  Line  What if these compare  c Bruyere observes that the inferior critic judges only by  comparison  In one sense all judgment must be formed on comparison But Bruyere who is speaking of poetry means that the inferior critic has no scale of judging of a work of art but by comparing it with some other work of the same kind He judges of Virgil by a comparison with Homer and of Spencer by comparing him with Tasso By such criticism he may indeed arrive at certain truths but he will never form that masterly judgment which he might do by comparing the work before him  with the great archetypes of nature and the solid rules of his artWhat Bruyere says of the critic in poetry is very applicable to the critic in painting The inferior critic who has travelled and seen the works of many great masters supposes he has treasured up from them the ideas of perfection and instead of judging of a picture by the rules of painting and it's agreement with nature he judges of it by the arbitrary ideas he has conceived and these too very pro∣bably much injured in the conception From this comparative mode of criti∣cizing the art receives no advancement All we gain is that one artist paints better than another  END OF THE NOTES
