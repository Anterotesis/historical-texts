at Lord  RAKELAND's  Enter a  SERVANT  followed by Lord  RAKELAND  Lord  RAKELAND  AT home To be sure I amhow could you make any doubts about it    Exit  Servant  Deny me to my old acquaintance and favourite friend Tom Contest  Enter Mr  CONTEST  My dear Contest I congratulate us both that your travels are completed and that you are come to taste for the remainder of your life the joys of your own country  Mr  CONTEST  Whether to taste joy or sorrow I am yet in doubt for I am uncertain in what manner I shall be received by my father  Lord  RAKELAND  Have not you seen him yet  Mr  CONTEST  Nonor dare I till I know in what humour he is  Lord  RAKELAND  In a good one you may depend upon it for he is very lately married  Mr  CONTEST  To my utter concern I heard some time ago indeed that it was his design to marry again but as he has never condescended to make me acquainted with it himself I know nothing farther respecting the marriage than what public report has thrown in my way Pray can you tell me who my new mother is  Lord  RAKELAND  I am told she is very young extremely lively and prodigiously beautiful I am told too that she has been confined in the country dressed and treated like a child till her present age of eighteen in order to preserve the appearance of youth in her mother  Mr  CONTEST  But who is her mother Of what family is she  Lord  RAKELAND  That I don't knowand I suppose your father did not consider of what family she was but merely what family she was likely to bring him  Mr  CONTEST  Yes I have no doubt but he married on purpose  to disinherit me for having written to him "that I had fixed my affections upon a widow of small fortune but one who was so perfectly to my wishes that even his commands could not force me to forsake her"  Lord  RAKELAND  And were you in earnest  Mr  CONTEST  I thought I was then but at present I am more humble I have implored his pardon for those hasty expressions and now only presume by supplication to obtain his approbation of my choice  Lord  RAKELAND  Is she a foreigner  Mr  CONTEST  No an English womanWe met at Florenceparted at Veniceand she arrived in London just four days before me  Lord  RAKELAND  And when will you introduce me to her  Mr  CONTEST  Are you as much a man of gallantry as ever If you are you shall first promise me not to make love to her  Lord  RAKELAND  As to that my dear friend you know I never make a promise when I think there is the least probability of my breaking it  Mr  CONTEST  Then positively you shall not see my choice  till I am secure of her But I can tell you what I'll doI'll introduce you to my young motherinlaw if you like  Lord  RAKELAND  My dear friend that will do quite as wellnay I don't know if it won't do better Come let us go directly  Mr  CONTEST  Hold not till I have obtained my father's leavefor after offending him so highly as not to hear from him these six months I thought it necessary to send a letter to him as soon as I arrived this morning to beg his permission to wait upon him And here I suppose is his answer  Enter a  SERVANT  and gives a letter to Mr  CONTEST  SERVANT  Your servant enquired for you Sir and left this  Exit    Mr  CONTEST  breaks open the letter hastily and reads    Mr  CONTEST  An invitation to go to his house immediately  He reads the remainder of the letter and then expressing surprise  Why my father tells me he was only married this very morning I heard he was married a week ago  Lord  RAKELAND  And so did Iand so did half the town His marriage has even been in the newspapers these three days  Mr  CONTEST  Ay these things are always announced before they take place and I most sincerely wish it had been delayed still longer  Lord  RAKELAND  I do notfor I long to have a kiss of the bride  Mr  CONTEST  Pshaw my Lord as it is the wedding day I cannot think of taking you now it may be improper  Lord  RAKELAND  Not at all not at all A wedding day is a public day and Sir Adam knows upon what familiar terms you and I are Indeed my dear friend my going will be considered but as neighbourly I can take no denialI must go  Mr  CONTEST  Well if it must be so come then  Going stops  Notwithstanding the cause I have for rejoicing at this kind invitation from my father still I feel embarrassed at the thoughts of appearing before him in the presence of his young wife for I have no doubt but she'll take a dislike to me  Lord  RAKELAND  And if she should I have no doubt but she'll take a liking to  me  So come away and be in spirits  Exeunt  SCENE II  An Apartment at Sir  ADAM CONTEST's  Enter Sir  ADAM  drest in white clothes like a Bridegroom  Sir  ADAM  Nothing is so provoking as to be in a situation where one is expected to be merryit is like being asked in company "to tell a good story and to be entertaining" and then you are sure to be duller than ever you were in your life Now notwithstanding this is my wedding day I am in such a blessed humour that I should like to make every person's life in this house a burthen to them But I won't  Struggling with himself  No I won'tWhat a continual combat is mine To feel a perpetual tendency to every vice and to possess no one laudable quality but that of a determination to overcome all my temptations I am strongly impelled to violent anger and yet I have the resolution to be a calm peaceable manI am inclined to suspicion yet I conquer it and  will  place confidence in othersI am disposed to malice yet I constantly get the better of itI am addicted to love yet INo holdthere I must stopthat is a failing which always did get the better of  me  Behold an instance of it  Enter Lady  CONTEST  slowly and pensively drest like a Bride  Sir  ADAM  Aside  Now I will be in a good humour in spite of all my doubts and fears  Lady  CONTEST  Did you send for me Sir Adam  Sir  ADAM  Yes my dear your guardian is just stept home to bring his wife to dine with us and I wished to have a few minutes conversation with you Sit down  They sit  I observed Lady Contest and it gave me uneasiness that at church this morning while the ceremony was performing you looked very pale You have not yet wholly regained your colour and instead of your usual cheerful countenance and air I perceive a pensive dejectedCome look cheerful  Very sharply  Why don't you look cheerful  Checking himself and softening his voice  Consider every one should be happy upon their wedding day for it is a day that seldom comes above once in a person's life  Lady  CONTEST  But with  you  Sir Adam it has come twice  Sir  ADAM  Very trueit hasand my  first  was a day indeed I shall never forget it My wife was as young as you are now  Lady  CONTEST  And you were younger than you are now  Sir  ADAM  Startsthen aside  No I won't be angry  To her  She was beautiful toonay more she was good she possessed every qualityBut this is not a proper topic on the present occasion and so my dear let us change the subject  Lady  CONTEST  Pray Sir Adam is it true that your son is come to town  Sir  ADAM  It is and I expect him here every moment  Lady  CONTEST  And have you invited no other company all day  Sir  ADAM  Your guardian and his wife Mr and Mrs Ploughman you know will be here and what other company would you have  Lady  CONTEST  In the country we had always fiddles and dancing at every wedding and I declare I have been merrier at other people's weddings than I think I am likely to be at my own  Sir  ADAM  If you loved me Lady Contest you would be merry in my company alone  Do  you love me My first wife loved me dearly  Lady  CONTEST  And so do I love you dearlyjust the same as I would love my father if he were alive  Sir  ADAM  Aside  Now could I lay her at my feet for that sentence But I won'tI won't  Struggling with himself  Answer me thiswould you change husbands with any one of your acquaintance  Lady  CONTEST  What signifies now my answering such a question as that when I am sure not one of my acquaintance would change with me  Sir  ADAM  What makes you think so  Violently    Softening  Your equipage will be by far the most splendid of any lady's you will visit I have made good my promise in respect to your jewels too and I hope you like them  Lady  CONTEST  Like them to be sureOh my dear Sir Adam they even make me like you  Sir  ADAM  A very poor proof of your love if you can give me no other  Lady  CONTEST  But I'll give you fifty others  Sir  ADAM  Anxiously  Name them  Lady  CONTEST  FirstI will always be obedient to you  Sir  ADAM  That's well  Lady  CONTEST  SecondI will never be angry with you if you should go out and stay for a monthnay for a yearor for as long as ever you like  Sir  ADAM  Aside and struggling with his passion  Sure I  was not born to commit murder I had better go out of the room  Lady  CONTEST  Humming a tune  "And old Robin Gray was kind to me"  Sir  ADAM  Rising in agitation  Oh my first wife my first wife what a treasure was she But my treasure is gone  Sighing  Lady  CONTEST  Not all your money I hope Sir Adam for my guardian told me you had a great deal  Sir  ADAM  And did you marry me for that What makes you blush Come confess to mefor there was always a sincerity in your nature which charmed me beyond your beauty It was that sincerity and that alone which captivated me  Lady  CONTEST  Then I am surprised you did not marry your chaplain's widow good old Mrs Brown  Sir  ADAM  Why so  Lady  CONTEST  Because I have heard you say "there was not so  sincere  a woman on the face of the earth"  Sir  ADAM  Aside  And egad I almost wish I had married her By what I have now said Lady Contest I meant to let you know that in comparison  with virtues I have no esteem for a youthful or a beautiful face  Lady  CONTEST  Oh dear how you and I differ for I here declare I do love a beautiful youthful face better than I love any thing in the whole world  Sir  ADAM  In a halfsmothered rage  Leave the roomleave the room instantly  After a violent struggle  No Come backcome back my dear  Tenderly    Aside  I'll be in a good humour presentlybut not just yetYesI  will  get the better of itI won't use her illI have sworn at the altar not to use her ill and I will keep my vow  He sits down affecting perfect composure and after a pause  Pray Lady Contest pray have not you heard from your mother yet  Lady  CONTEST  Not a line nor a word  Sir  ADAM  It is wonderful that she should not send us a proper address There is no doubt but that every letter we have sent to her since she has been abroad has miscarried However it will be great joy and pride to her when she hears of your marriage  Lady  CONTEST  Yesfor she always said I was not born to make my fortune  Sir  ADAM  Which prediction I have annulled And after allCome hithercome hither  Takes her kindly  by the hand  And after all I do not repent that I havefor although I cannot say that you possess all those qualifications which my first wife did yet you behave very well considering your age  Lady  CONTEST  And I am sure so do you considering yours  Sir  ADAM  All my resolution is gone and I can keep my temper no longer  Aside  Go into your own chamber immediately  He takes her by the hand and puts her off  I'llI'llI'll  Threatening as if going to follow her then stops short  No I'll go another way    As he is going off at the opposite side enter a Servant    SERVANT  My young master and another gentleman  Enter Mr  CONTEST  and Lord  RAKELAND  Mr  CONTEST  To Sir Adam  I kneel Sir for your pardon and your blessing  Sir  ADAM  You have behaved very ill but as you appear sensible of it I forgive and am glad to see you But I expect that your future conduct shall give proof of your repentance My Lord Rakeland I beg pardon for introducing this subject before you but you are not wholly unacquainted with it I suppose  Lord  RAKELAND  Mr Contest has partly informed me  Aside to Mr  Contest  Ask for your mother  Mr  CONTEST  I sincerely congratulate you on your nuptials Sir and I hope Lady Contest is well  Sir  ADAM  Going to the side of the scene  Desire Lady Contest to walk this way  Lord  RAKELAND  I sincerely congratulate you too Sir Adam  Sir  ADAM  Thank you my Lord thank you    Enter Lady  Contest  Sir  Adam  takes her by the hand and presents Mr  Contest  to her    My dear this is my sonand this Tom is your motherinlaw  Lady  CONTEST  Dear Sir Adam  half laughing  I was never so surprised in my life Always when you spoke of your son you called him Tom and Tommy and I expected to see a little boy  Sir  ADAM  And have you any objection to his being a man  Lady  CONTEST  Oh no I think I like him the better  To Mr  Contest  Sir I am very glad to see you  Mr  CONTEST  I give your Ladyship joy  Salutes her hand  Lady  CONTEST  I shall be very fond of him Sir AdamI shall like him as well as if he was my own  Sir  ADAM  Aside  Now am I in a rage lest seeing my son a man she should be more powerfully reminded that I am old and I long to turn him out of doors But I won'tnoI'll be the kinder to him for this very suspicion Come Tom let me shake hands with youwe have not shaken hands a great while and let this be a sign of the full renewal of my paternal affection  Lord  RAKELAND  Sir Adam you have not introduced me to Lady Contest  Lady  CONTEST  Is this another son  Sir  ADAM  What could you be fond of him too  Lady  CONTEST  Yes I could  Sir  ADAM  And like him as well as if he were your own  Lady  CONTEST  Yes I could  Sir  ADAM  But he is not my son  Lady  CONTEST  I can't help thinking he is  Looking stedfastly at him  Sir  ADAM  I tell you he is not  Lady  CONTEST  Nay nay you are jokingI am sure he is  Sir  ADAM  Raising his voice  I tell you no  Lady  CONTEST  Why he is very like you  She goes up to Lord  Rakeland  and looks in his face  No he is not so like when you are close I beg ten thousand pardons Sir you are not at all like Sir Adam  Sir  ADAM  Aside  Zounds now I am jealousand I am afraid my propensity will get the better of me But no it shan'tNo it  shall not  My Lord I beg your pardon but I want half an hour's private conversation with my son will you excuse us  Lord  RAKELAND  Certainly Sir AdamI beg you will make no stranger of me  Sir  ADAM  Taking Mr  Contest  by the hand  Come Tom  Aside  There now I have left them alone and I think this is triumphing over my jealousy pretty well Well done Sir Adam well done well done  Exit with Mr  Contest  Sir  Adam  smiling with selfapplause at the victory he has gained  Lord  RAKELAND  My dear Lady Contest though I acknowledge I have not the happiness to be your son yet permit me to beg a blessing on my knees'Tis thisTell me when and where I shall have the happiness of seeing you again  Lady  CONTEST  Dear Sir without any compliment the happiness will be done to me  Lord  RAKELAND  Enchanting woman appoint the time  Lady  CONTEST  I'll ask Sir Adam  Lord  RAKELAND  Nowithout his being present  Lady  CONTEST  I don't know if I sha'n't like that full as well  Lord  RAKELAND  Appoint a time then just to play a game at cribbage  Lady  CONTEST  Or what do you think of "Beggar my Neighbour"would not that do as well  Lord  RAKELAND  Perfectly as well The very thing  Lady  CONTEST  But you must take care how you play for it is a game you may lose a great deal of money by  Lord  RAKELAND  But Sir Adam must not know of it  Enter Sir  ADAM  and speaks aside  Sir  ADAM  Resolutions come and goI wish I could  have kept mine and staid away a little longer  Affecting good humour  What my Lord here still holding conversation with this giddy woman  Lord  RAKELAND  Affecting coldness  I assure you Sir Adam I am very well pleased with Lady Contest's conversation  Lady  CONTEST  And I am sure my Lord I am very  much  pleased with yours  Lord  RAKELAND  We have been talking about a game at cards  Lady  CONTEST  But you said Sir Adam was not to be of the party  Lord  RAKELAND  Yes Sir Adambut not Mr Contest  Lady  CONTEST  No indeed you said Sir Adam  Lord  RAKELAND  Oh no  Lady  CONTEST  Eagerly  Yesbecause don't you remember I saidand you made answer  Lord  RAKELAND  I don't remember any thing  Lady  CONTEST  What don't you remember kneeling for my blessing  Sir  ADAM  How What  Lord  RAKELAND  Sir Adam it would be a breach of good manners were I to contradict Lady Contest a second time therefore I acknowledge that she is rightand that I have been in the wrong  Exit bowing with great respect  Lady  CONTEST  To Sir  Adam  apart and pulling his sleeve  Won't you ask him to dinner  Sir  ADAM  Ask him to dinner What a difference between you and my first wifeWould  she  have wished me to ask him to dinner would  she  have suffered a man to kneel  Lady  CONTEST  I did not suffer him to kneel a moment  Sir  ADAM  But my first wife was a model of perfection and it is unjust to reproach you with the comparison Yet I cannot help sayingwould she had lived  Lady  CONTEST  And I am sure I wish so with all my heart  Sir  ADAM  Fetching a heavy sigh  But she was suddenly snatched from me  Lady  CONTEST  How was it Sir Adam Were you not at sea  together And so a storm aroseand so you took to the longboatand she would stay in the shipand so she called to you and you would not goand you called to her and she would not come And so your boat sailed and her ship sunk  Sir  ADAM  Don't don'tI can't bear to hear it repeated I loved her too sincerely But the only proof I can now give of my affection is to be kind to her son and as by what he acknowledged to me his heart I perceived was bent upon marriage I have given him leave to introduce to me the lady on whom he has fixed his choiceand if I like her  Lady  CONTEST  Has he fixed his choice Who is the young lady What is her name  Sir  ADAM  I did not ask her name  Lady  CONTEST  But I hope you will give your consent whoever she is  Sir  ADAM  And if I do in a little time they may both wish I had not Young people are so capricious they don't know their own minds half an hour For instance I dare say you think very highly of that young Lord who was here just now but if you were to see him two or three times a week you would cease to admire him  Lady  CONTEST  I should like to try Do invite him here two or three times a week on purpose to try  Enter  SERVANT  SERVANT  Mr and Mrs Ploughman are come Sir and dinner is almost ready  Exit  Lady  CONTEST  Looking at her hand gives a violent scream  Oh OhOh dear Sir AdamOh dear Oh dear Oh dear  Sir  ADAM  What's the matter What in the name of heaven is the matter  Lady  CONTEST  I wish I may die if I have not lost my wedding ringOh 'tis a sure sign of some ill luck  Sir  ADAM  Here John    Enter  SERVANT  Go and look for your mistress's wedding ring she has dropt it somewhere about the house  Lady  CONTEST  I am afraid it was in the street as I stepp'd out of my coach Oh indeed Sir Adam it did not stick close I remember I pulled my glove off just at that time go and look there John    Exit  SERVANT  Oh Sir Adam some ill luck will certainly happen to one or both of us you may depend upon it  Sir  ADAM  Childish nonsense What ill luck can happen to us while we are good  Lady  CONTEST  But suppose we should not be good  Sir  ADAM  We always may if we please  Lady  CONTEST  I know we may But then sometimes 'tis a great deal of trouble  Sir  ADAM  Come don't frighten yourself about omens you'll find your ring again  Lady  CONTEST  Do you think that young Lord mayn't have found it Suppose we send to ask him  Sir  ADAM  Did you miss it while he was here  Lady  CONTEST  No nor should not have missed any thing if he had staid till midnight  Sir  ADAM  Taking her by the hand  Come come to dinner  Going stops  But I must say this has been a very careless thing of you My first wife would not have lost  her  wedding ring  Lady  CONTEST  But indeed Sir Adam mine did not fit  Exeunt  END OF THE FIRST ACT  ACT II  SCENE I  An Apartment at Mr  MILLDEN's  Enter Lady  AUTUMN  and Mrs  HAMFORD  Mrs  HAMFORD  MY dear Lady Autumn Mr Contest is not of a proper age for a lover much less for a husband of yours  Lady  AUTUMN  Mrs Hamford I believe old as you pretend to think me now you thought me young but a few weeks ago at Venice when on your first landing there you imposed upon me your romantic tale and prevailed with me to bring you to England  Mrs  HAMFORD  Hold Madam do not conclude too hastily that because I have for a few days since my arrival in my native country deferred my promise of revealing to you my real name and my connections here that I am for this reason an impostor  Lady  AUTUMN  No upon recollection you certainly  have  been living on a savage island for these ten or twelve years which gives you all these Hottentot ideas in respect to the advanced age of women In some savage countries women are old at seventeen but in this enlightened nation we are all young at seventy  Enter Mr  MILLDEN  Mr  MILLDEN  Lady Autumn I make no apology for entering your apartment thus abruptly because I come with good newsYour daughter is married  Lady  AUTUMN  Married What while I have been abroad  Mr  MILLDEN  No doubtBut I cannot give you any particulars of the marriage nor tell you even the gentleman's namefor I only passed her guardian by accident in his carriage and I had not an opportunity to enquire nor he to inform me farther than "that it was a most advantageous union for your daughter for that her husband is a man of fortune and title"  Mrs  HAMFORD  There Lady Autumn you find you have a daughter old enough to be a wife  Lady  AUTUMN  More shame for herWhy was not my consent asked  Mr  MILLDEN  You were out of England and no letters reached you However your daughter's guardian will call upon you in the evening and explain to you every particular  Lady  AUTUMN  But now my dear Mr Millden and you my dear Mrs Hamford don't let this marriage escape your lips if Mr Contest should call this  eveningfor if my daughter's husband should not after all be a man of some importance I should wish to keep it a secret from Mr Contest that I have a daughter married  Exit  Mr  MILLDEN  Mrs Hamford I observe a gloom upon your countenance I hope no enquiries you have made concerning any part of your family since you arrived in England  He takes her hand  You tremble What's the matter  Mrs  HAMFORD  I tremble till a visit which I am now going to make is over and then whatever is my destiny I trust in that Power which has supported me through numerous trials to give me resignation  Exeunt  SCENE II  An Apartment at Sir  ADAM CONTEST's  Enter Lady  CONTEST  followed by her Maid  Lady  CONTEST  Pulling off her cloak  Has any body called on me Hannah since I have been out  HANNAH  Yes Madam an elderly gentlewoman but she refused to leave her nameshe said she had particular business and wanted to speak to you in private  Lady  CONTEST  Then pray let me see her when she comes again  HANNAH  I told her Madam that you were only gone to the milliner's in the next street  Lady  CONTEST  Has any body else called Hannah  HANNAH  No ma'am  Enter a  SERVANT  SERVANT  Lord Rakeland if your Ladyship is not engaged  Lady  CONTEST  Drawing  Hannah  on one side  Oh Hannah Hannah is this the elderly gentlewomanOh for shame HannahHowever poor Hannah don't be uneasy I won't be very angry with you  To the  Servant  You may desire his Lordship to walk up  Exit  Servant  HANNAH  Upon my word my lady  Lady  CONTEST  Oh hold your tongue Hannahyou know this is the elderly gentlewoman you meantbut no matterI am almost every bit as well pleased  Enter Lord  RAKELAND  Exit  Hannah  Lord  RAKELAND  My adorable Lady Contest  Lady  CONTEST  I hope you are very wellbut I need not ask for you look charmingly  Lord  RAKELAND  And you look like a divinity I met Sir Adam this moment in his carriage going out and that emboldened me  Lady  CONTEST  Yes Sir he is gone out for a little while with my guardian but he'll soon be back I suppose Sir you called to play an hand of cards  Lord  RAKELAND  Nomy errand was to tell youI love you I adore you and to plead for your love in return  Lady  CONTEST  But that is not in my power to give  Lord  RAKELAND  You cannot possibly have given it to Sir Adam  Lady  CONTEST  I sha'n't tell you what I have done with it  Lord  RAKELAND  You could love me I know you could  Lady  CONTEST  If you were my husband I would try and then perhaps take all the pains I would I could not  Lord  RAKELAND  Oh that I  were  your husband  Kneeling  Lady  CONTEST  You would not kneel so if you were Not even on the wedding day  Lord  RAKELAND  No but I would clasp you thus  Throwing his arms about her  Lady  CONTEST  Oh dear Oh dear I am afraid Sir Adam's first wife would not have suffered this  Lord  RAKELAND  Why talk of Sir Adam Oh that you were mine instead of his  Lady  CONTEST  And would you really marry me if I were single  Lord  RAKELAND  Would Iyesthis instant were you unmarried this instant with rapture I would become your happy bridegroom  Lady  CONTEST  I wonder what Sir Adam would say were he to hear you talk thus He suspected you were in love with me at the very firstI can't say I didI suspected nothingbut I have found a great deal  Lord  RAKELAND  Nothing to my disadvantage I hope  Lady  CONTEST  Nonor any thing that shall be of disadvantage to Sir Adam  Lord  RAKELAND  Why are you perpetually talking of your husband  Lady  CONTEST  Because when I am in your company I am always thinking of him  Lord  RAKELAND  Do I make you think of your husband  Lady  CONTEST  Yesand you make me tremble for him  Lord  RAKELAND  Never be unhappy about Sir Adam  Lady  CONTEST  I won'tand he shall never have cause to be unhappy about mefor I'll go lock myself up till he comes home  Going  Lord  RAKELAND  Holding her  What are you alarmed at Is there any thing to terrify you either in my countenance or addressIn your presence I feel myself an object of pity not of terror  Lady  CONTEST  Ay but this may be all makebelieve like the poor little boy in the song  SONG  I  In the dead of the night when with labour opprest  All mortals enjoy the calm blessing of ease  Cupid knock'd at my window disturbing my rest  Who's there I demandedBegone if you please  II  He answer'd so meekly so modest and mild  Dear ma'am it is I an unfortunate child  'Tis a cold rainy night I am wet to the skin  I have lost my way ma'am so pray let me in  III  No sooner from wet and from cold he got ease  Then taking his bow he cry'd Ma'am if you please  If you please ma'am I would by experiment know  If the rain has damaged the string of my bow  IV  Then away skipp'd the urchin as brisk as a bee  And laughing I wish you much joy ma'am said he  My bow is undamag'd for true went the dart  But you will have trouble enough with your heart  Going  Enter  SERVANT  SERVANT  A lady a stranger who Mrs Hannah says your Ladyship gave orders should be admitted  Lady  CONTEST  Very trueDesire her to walk

don't know any thing about her  Lord  RAKELAND  Dear Lady Contest do not let me meet her on the stairs conceal me somewhere till she is gone  Here I'll go into this dressingroom  He goes to a door which leads to the next chamber  Lady  CONTEST  Then you will hear our discourse  Lord  RAKELAND  No matter I will keep it a secret  Lady  CONTEST  No no you must go awayout of the house  Lord

to reveal to you and to receive from  you  advice how to act rather than by confiding in the judgment of any of my own family be flattered by their partiality into a blameable system of conduct Such is the nature of my present errand to you but to my great surprise I find you so very very young  Lady  CONTEST  Yes Ma'am thank heaven  Mrs  HAMFORD  And you are very happy I presume  Lady  CONTEST  Hesitating  Yes Ma'amyes very happy all things considered  Mrs  HAMFORD  I am sorry then to be the messenger of news  that will most probably destroy that happiness for ever  Lady  CONTEST  Dear me what news You frighten me out of my wits  Rising  Mrs  HAMFORD  You are now Lady Contest newly married in the height of youth health prosperity and I am the fatal object who in one moment may crush all those joys  Lady  CONTEST  Oh then pray don'tyou'll break my heart if you do What have I done or what has happened to take away from me all my joysWhere's my pocket handkerchief  Feeling in her pocket  Mrs  HAMFORD  Here take mine and compose yourself  Lady  CONTEST  Taking it  Thank you Ma'am  Mrs  HAMFORD  And now my dear I will inform youand at the same time flatter myself that you will deal frankly with me and not restrain any of those sensations which my tale may cause  Lady  CONTEST  Dear Madam I never conceal any of my sensationsI can't if I would  Mrs  HAMFORD  Then what will they be when I tell youI am  Sir Adam Contest's wifehis wife whom he thinks drowned but who was preserved and restored to life though not till now restored to my own country  Lady  CONTEST  Dear Madam

CONTEST  And is that worth being in such an ill temper aboutAh you would not be so cross if you knew something  Sir  ADAM  Knew whatI have a piece of news to tell you  Lady  CONTEST  And I have a piece of news to tell  you  Sir  ADAM  Your mother is arrived in town your guardian heard so this morning but he did not mention it to me till this moment because he thinks it is proper for him to wait upon and acquaint her with our marriage in form before I throw myself at her feet to ask her blessing  Lady  CONTEST  Very wellwith all my heart And now Sir Adamwhat do you think  Sir  ADAM  What do I think  Lady  CONTEST  What will you give me to tell you something that will make you go almost out of your wits with joy  Sir  ADAM  What do you meanHave I got another estate left me  Lady

Sir  ADAM  And have not I suffered too I am sure I have lamented her loss every hour of my life you have heard me  Lady  CONTEST  And yet you don't seem half so much pleased at her return as I am  Sir  ADAM  I cannot help being concerned to think what a melancholy twelve or fourteen years the poor woman has experienced most likely upon some desert island instead of being in heaven  Lady  CONTEST  But if you are concerned upon  her  account you ought to be pleased upon your own my dear  Checks herself  I beg pardon I mean Sir Adam  Sir  ADAM  No no call me "my dear"do not shew reserve to me

feelings  Well Madam I am prepared to see my first wifeand to part with my second  Lady  CONTEST  Then sit down and write to her that you long to see her  Sir  ADAM  No I can sacrifice all my sensations but I cannot sacrifice truth  Lady  CONTEST  Will you give me leave to write to her a kind letter for you and invite her to come hither directly  Sir  ADAM  After a struggle  You may do as

wedlock you have both been wrong  Sir  ADAM  However it shall be  my  endeavour to be henceforward right for after settling upon my young bride a handsome dower I will peaceably yield her upand though it is a hard struggle yet like all my other struggles it will I have no doubt give me happiness in the end  Lady  CONTEST  Crying till she sobs  Good b'ye Sir Adamgood b'yeI did love you a little upon

should  pinch  my finger  THE END
