 A DISSERTATION ON THE ARMORIAL ENSIGNS OF THE COUNTY OF  MIDDLESEX  AND OF THE ABBEY AND CITY OF  WESTMINSTER  BY SIR JOHN HAWKINS KNT CHAIRMAN of the QUARTER and GENERAL SESSIONS of the PEACE and of OYER and TERMINER for the same COUNTY  M DCC LXXX  Dissertation on the armorial Ensigns of the County of  Middlesex  and of the Abbey and City of  Westminster  by  Sir John Hawkins  IT has lately been agitated as a question involving in it some circumstances respecting the history and antiquities of this kingdom whether there are any armorial ensigns or heraldical device appropriated to the county of Middlesex A question of somewhat the more importance as the determination thereof will either justify or condemn the assumption of three  sabres  or  falchions  for so I must at present term them as the impress or cognizance of that county and the consequent displaying them on the colours of the western regiment of the military corps maintained by the same  And here it is first to be observed that in the great west window of Westminster Abbey there are five compartments the first whereof viz that on the south side contains the device abovementioned under a regal crown or rather a circle with points This though by some mistaken for the arms of King Alfred it may be presumed refers to Sebert king of the East Saxons for this reason that he was the founder of the church and convent and that in the time of the heptarchy the same was the armorial ensign of the kingdom of the East Saxons as may be seen together with the arms of the other kingdoms in Speed's Chronicle and also in Heylin's Help to English History edit page with the addition of the terms of blazonry  It may perhaps be thought that the three sabres were the family arms of Sebert and the family of Seber who now bear them attempt to justify their claim by this supposition but the fact is otherwise it being pretty evident that till of very late times the arms borne by our princes were not their own if they had any but those of the kingdom for the time being even the cross and martlets which are reputed to be Edward the Confessor's arms were not peculiar to him or his family Egbert the first monarch of England took the cross as the arms of the kingdom Alfred added thereto four martlets and Edward the Confessor made them five by the addition of one at the base point and as to the arms in question it seems that they were borne by Erkenwyne the first of the East Saxon kings and his successors  The arms of France and England in a quarterly bearing the device of Edward III who imitated therein the quartering of the arms of Castile and Leon was also the bearing of his successors as kings of England and were  Semée F  eur de Lys  that is to say the field sown or powdered with fleurs de lys  So Cotgrave in  voce semée  and see them thus represented in the arms of England  n Westminsterhall at the foot of the arched beams that form the roof also on the tomb of Edward III in Westminster Abbey or to go no farther the heads and monuments by Vertue in Rapin's History from Edward III to Henry V inclusive  until Charles VI of France reduced them to three when our Henry V did the like Camden's Remains and so they continued  It is now time to enquire after the true appellation of those warlike weapons that compose the East Saxon device and upon consulting the authors undermentioned I find that that curved weapon which I have called a sabre or falchion was anciently termed a  Sach  and there can be little doubt but that from the constant use of it in battle the Saxons at large derived their name  The following are the sentiments of sundry learned etymologists on the subject  Camden among other opinions touching the denomination mentions that of its derivation from the word  Saxa  which he says gave occasion to the following rhyme of Engelhusius  Quippe brevis gladius apud illos Saxa vocatur  Unde sibi Saxo nomen traxisse putatur  The Saxon people did as most believe  Their name from Saxa a short sword receive  Introduction to Camden's Britannia by Bp Gibson Edition col  Bishop Gibson the editor of Camden seems to prefer this etymology to the others adduced by his author and especially to reject that opinion of Michael Neander that the Saxons came from the Sacae or Sassones of Asia in opposition whereto he cites a passage from Bishop Stillingfleet's Origines Brit p in these words  "However this original of the Saxons from the Sacae of Asia may be thought too far fetched unless there were some fair historical account how the Saxons came to be propagated by those Sacae and no such account being given it may seem to be little more than a possibility Nor may that other original from the short swords called Sachs seem altogether vain when it is considered that the Quirites had their name from Quiris a short spear and the Scythians from Scytten to shoot with a bow Tacitus also speaking of some of the northern Germans saith that the common badges they wear are round shields and short swords and the arms of Saxony to this day as Pontanus observes are two short swords across"  Junius in his Etymologicon Anglicanum Voce Sachs is more express to the purpose making it to signify Cultrum a knife Pugio a dagger or poniard and Gladius a sword More particularly he asserts that the SAKS was a kind of sword the blade and hilt whereof were nearly of equal length that it had only one sharp edge and was not unlike a knife for cutting meat and adds that in his time the Danes used the word Sass for a pair of shears He denies that the nation of the Saxons derived its name from the Latin Saxum as being a hardy stony race as he says has been asserted by some upon the authority of Isidore Lib IX Orig c On the contrary he maintains that it came from those knives which the Germans call Sachs It farther appears from this author in  loc cit  that the word Sachs has sometimes been rendered by the Latin appellative Sica a short sword or poniard and he conjectures that the French Scie a saw may be derived therefrom  Sir Henry Spelman in his Glossary Voce Saxones cites two lines from Roswitha de Gest Odonum which seem to favor the derivation of Saxones from Saxum Nevertheless he concurs with Junius and to add weight to his conjecture in the next article viz Saxo renders the term by Brevis Gladius and gives from Gothofredus Viterbiensis the following verses  Pax ubi congeritur sub fraude Macedo veretur  Ne malè frustretur si totus inermis habetur  Unde brevis gladios clam tulit arte secus  Ipse brevis gladius apud illos Saxo vocatur  Unde sibi Saxo nomen peperisse notatur  His quoque cultellis vita redempta fuit  Verstegan though a writer of somewhat less authority than any of those above cited is nevertheless worth consulting on the subject and the rather as he elucidates it by the relation of sundry curious particulars which he sums up in a positive assertion that the Saxons had their name from this crooked or scythelike kind of sword adding that he was confirmed in this his opinion by a conversation he once had with Justus Lipsi  s on the subject who concurred with him therein Restitution of Decayed Intelligence p  In modern heraldical language it seems that the weapon above described is termed a Seax Vide Blount's Glossographia in Vocibus Saxons et Seax Phillips's Dict in Articulo Verstegan p et seq Farther Heylin thus blazons the arms of the East Saxons  Gules three seaxes Argent pommels Or  adding that this was a weapon of the Saxons which they wore under their coats when they slew the Britons on Salisbury Plain Help to English History page  The particular circumstances of this slaughter are related both by William of Malmesbury and Geoffry of Monmouth from the former of these as being of the two a writer of the best authority it may be supposed that Hollinshed took that account of it which is given in his history Vol I p and is here inserted  "When Hengist had knowledge of the huge host of the Brytains that was comming against him he required to come to a communication with Vortigerne which request was graunted so that it was concluded that on Mayday a certain number of Britains and as many of the Saxons should meete togither upon the Plaine of Salisburie  Hengist having devised a newe kind of treason when the daye of theyr appoynted meet  ng was come caused every one of his allowed number secretely to put into his hose a long knyfe where it was ordeined that no man should bryng any weapon with him at all and that at the verie instant when this watchworde shoulde be vttered by him Nempt i e take your sexes then should every of them plucke out his knife and slea the Brytayne that cha  nced to be next to him except the same shoulde bee Vortigerne whom he willed to be apprehended but not slaine  At the day assigned the king with his appointed number of Brytaynes nothing mistrust  ng lesse than any such manner of unfaythfull dealing came to the place in order before prescribed without armour or weapon where hee found readie Hengist with his Saxons the which receyued the king with amiable countenance in moste louing sort but after they were entred a little into communication Hengist meaning to accomplish hys deuysed purpose gave the watchworde immediately whereupon the Saxons drewe out theyr knyves and sodainly fell on the Brytaynes and slue them as sheepe being fallen within the daunger of woolves"  It seems that this kind of weapon was in use also with the Spartans for Plutarch relates that one of that nation being jested with for wearing a sword so short readily answered that it was sufficiently long to reach the heart of an enemy  It must be confessed that the foregoing testimonies of the Etymologists do in strictness prove no more than that the device of the three Seaxes was a proper and apposite designation of the Saxon people in general as pointing to a particular circumstance in their martial oeconomy and seeing that each of the other six kingdoms that made up the heptarchy had as good a claim to this bearing as the latter it may be a matter of wonder that the propriety of it did not recommend it to those who had the first election  To this it may be answered that the question now under discussion is not to whom the device now spoken of most properly belonged but who were the people that first adopted it This is an enquiry touching a fact which besides that it is above ascertained may thus be accounted for The kingdom of Kent was the first founded and the principal of the Heptarchy and for the cognizance thereof Hengist who led the Saxons into Britain displayed on his banner a white horse in Saxon Hengst in allusion to his name and which is even now the bearing of the house of Saxony Ella the first king of the South Saxons had taken six martlets Cuthred of the West Saxons a griffin The East Saxon kingdom was next in the order of erection and for that Erkenwyne made choice of the device of three Seaxes  See the arms of the several kingdoms of the heptarchy in the annexed plate No I et seq to No IX Upon which it is to be observed that No VI and VII are the arms of Bernicia and Deira two several provinces of Northumbria until Oswin king of the former having subdued Deira and become sole monarch of Northumbria took for the arms thereof  Azure a cross between four lions rampant Or  as represented by No VIII Of the province of Deira from whence Durham quasi Deirham mention is made by Bede in his Ecclesiastical History in which taking occasion to speak of the conversion of the Saxons to christianity he relates that certain captive children being exposed to sale in the marketplace of Rome Gregory afterwards Pope the first of that name questioned them touching their country and being answered that they were Angli he resembled them to angels and enquiring from what province they came and receiving for answer Deira he replied in a quibble less witty than benevolent that they should be freed de Dei ira from the wrath of God soon after which Augustine came hither charged with a mission to teach and p  opagate the christian faith  than which as being a generical etymological symbol including in the very name thereof that of the nation which assumed it a more apposite one could hardly have been suggested  It is presumed that the authorities here cited are abundantly sufficient to prove that the three Seaxes blazoned in the colours above described were the proper armorial device of the kingdom of the East Saxons and when it is considered that the same consisted of the counties of Essex and Middlesex and part of Hertfordshire and that Westminster situated in Middlesex was the seat of its kings one of whom was the founder of the abbey there and farther that this county from the dissolution of the heptarchy down to this time has been the principal residence of the English monarchs and the fountain both of justice and legislature when these circumstances I say are considered the propriety of assuming as the martial designation of the county of Middlesex the device of that territory of which it made so great and respectable a part will hardly admit of a question  Of the A  ms of the A  bey and City of Westminster  THE arms of Edward the Confessor are in general appropriated to the abbey of Westminster and are thus blazoned  Azure a Cross fleuré  or as some term it  pat  nce between five Mart  ets Or  Carved over the north entrance into the abbey they have the appearance of No X in the annexed Plate Upon which it may be observed that they are precisely the same with those of Sebert king of the East Saxons in Norden's Speculum Britanniae page Nevertheless the arms of the abbey as they appear on the tomb of Abbot Flaccet or Fascet in the chapel of St Erasmus and also among the arms of the mitred abbies in Bishop Tanner's Notitia Monastica are  Azure a crosier or pastoral staff and a mitre in chief  and so are they represented in the plate of Westminster Abbey in Newcourt's Repertorium and in a rude manner in Leland's Collectanea vol I page Vide No XI  The college arms on the wall over the great table in the college hall and those in a shield near it containing the college arms  party per pale  with the arms of the dean bishop Wilcocks and also in another like the latter in the great west window of the church are the  cross and martlets  and  above them or in chief those of France and England  quarterly between two roses gules  agreeing with the description thereof by Sir George Buck who in his Treatise of the Foundations of all the Colleges c in and about London printed at the end of Stow's Chronicle chap says That the ancient arms of the abbey of Westminster were  partie per fesse endente Or and Azure a crosier erect and a miter in chief  but that the new arms of the college are partly the arms of Edward the Confessor and partly those of England  in a chief Or between two red roses  Vide No XII  The roses as they are red clearly allude to that badge or cognizance of the house of Lancaster which with another viz the  Portcullis  is to be seen on the gates and almost in every corner both within and without of the chapel of Henry VII Fuller asserts that the addition of the chief above given was an augmentation of the ancient conventual seal plainly relating to the enlargement of the church by the erection of Henry the Seventh's chapel Church Hist Book VI Page and accordingly they are represented on the rods of the vergers the covers of the common prayer and musical servicebooks and such at this time are the arms of the college as they appear at the seet of Saint Peter on the reverse of the common seal of the Dean and Chapter affixed to their leases and other corporate instruments  The arms of the city of Westminster differ from those of the college and are variously represented In the great west window of the Abbey in the extreme compartment toward the north and also in a window on the south side of the Broadway chapel Westminster they appear as in No XIII  But in the compartment over the seat of the chairman in the Guildhall Westminster the arms of Edward the Confessor take the place in the chief of the arms of England the roses occupying the extremities as is seen in No XIV  The  Portcullis  seems to have been a favourite device of Henry VII as importing his descent from the house of Lancaster  He seems also to have been equally desirous of declaring by symbols his relation to the house of York for besides the white rose conjoined with the red in the gates of his chapel▪ and elsewhere in and about that sumptuous edifice there occurs the device of a Falcon in a Fetterlock which was the badge or cognizance of Edmund of Langley duke of York Camd Rem  the original assumption whereof is thus to be accounted for John of Gaunt duke of Lancaster had a concubine named Catherine Swinford and being entitled by descent to the castle of Beaufort in the province of Anjou and resid+ing there at certain times Catherine within the walls of it was delivered of a son named John who together with others of his children by her was legitimated by a statute of th Richard II and surnamed  named d  Beaufort soon after which the said John was created earl of Somerset In reference to the place and circumstances of their birth these children assumed for their badge or cognizance a  Portcullis  a frequent symbol with the heralds of a castle or fortress and the same is at this day the crest of the duke of Beaufort  Henry de Beaufort duke of Somerset the grandson of the above John de Beaufort and whose father Anno was created duke of Somerset dying without lawful issue temp Edward IV left issue by Joan Hill a son named Charles who assumed the name of Somerset and was created earl of Worcester from whom descended Henry Somerset marquis of Worcester afterwards duke of Beaufort Heyl Help to English History Page Collins's Peerage Duke of Beaufort  who claims a descent from the above John de Beaufort See Sir Richard Baker's Chron and Collins's Peerage in Somerset duke of Beaufort  Henry VII as appears by his pedigree in Rapin was descended from the above son of John of Gaunt wherefore and because that son had  osen the  Portcullis  for his device and his immediate descendants had adopted it it seems that the augmentation of the arms would have been more explicit and correspondent with his own intention had the chief contained a Portcullis between the Roses as it does in the shield over the monument of bishop Wilcocks in which the arms of the Bishop as Dean are impaled with his own paternal arms  The arms on bishop Wilcocks's monument are blazoned quarterly the shield containing in the first quarter the episcopal arms of Rochester in the second his paternal coat in the third the three crowns as Dean of the Order of the Bath and in the fourth the arms of Edward the Confessor with a Portcullis between two Roses in Chief  but whether with any sufficient warrant we are to seek  As touching the arms in the great west window it is to be noted that there are five compartments containing as follows viz I Arms of king Sebert the founder of the abbey II Arms of England and France temp Elizabeth the foundress of the college III Arms of GreatBritain and France temp George II in whose reign the towers were built IV The c  l  e  e arms impaled with those of bishop Wilcocks who being dean of Westminster was very active in procuring grants of public money for the repair of the fabric and the erection of the towers as may be collected from the
