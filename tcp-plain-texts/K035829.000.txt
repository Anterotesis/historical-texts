 THE INVASION OR A TRIP to BRIGHTHELMSTONE A FARCE OF TWO ACTS As it is performed with UNIVERSAL APPLAUSE▪ AT THE THEATREROYAL IN COVENTGARDEN WRITTEN BY F PILON  LONDON  PRINTED FOR G KEARSLEY NO FLEETSTREET MDCCLXVIII  Entered at StationersHall  DEDICATION TO THOMAS HARRIS ESQ  SIR  YOUR treatment to me has been so singularly kind and liberal that it would be inflicting the severest punishment on my pride to oblige me to conceal it from the world I had been taught to believe that without a patron amongst the great or an established literary same it was next to an impossibility to get a piece introduced on the stage but you Sir have proved to me that this complaint is groundless tho' unknown and unprotected your behaviour to me has been such as the most delicate mind could suggest or the most powerful influence have procured me If then you countenance thus warmly so humble a tribute as mine at the shrine of the muses how much superior attention must you bestow on the more elevated and sublime efforts of the  mind when Thalia comes arrayed by the hand of Genius with resistless graces or her weeping sister in native fables with all the conflicting passions in her train The encouragement you give to every dawn of talents whilst it wins you the respect and esteem of the public must prove of the most essential service to the cause of letters Patronage and success often lend a degree of force and brilliancy to moderate abilities but ripen a truly fine genius into immediate perfection I have the honour to remain  SIR  Your much obliged And faithful humble servant FREDERICK PILON  PREFACE  PUBLIC taste has run so much of late on the French  petite comedie  of two  acts  that it seems necessary to say something in justification of  farce  to prevent its being tried by the too rigid rules of criticism In this refined age  low  and  absurd  are terms of reproach heard to echo from the benches of the upper gallery so that whoever attempts to raise a laugh by downright  farce  must expect critics in all quarters of the house ready to damn him for attempting to put them in good humour  Farce  has ever been considered so essentially different from  comedy  that any incident in the latter bordering upon the  extravagant  has been termed  farcical  or  outré  by way of discrimination This species of entertainment is certainly more a  caricature  than a  faithful picture of nature  the outline is preserved but extended and every tint of the colouring considerably heightened For instancecan any thing be more improbable and extravagant than the plot and incidents of the Mock Doctor yet this has been the production of two of the first comic geniusses this or any other country ever produced It is not to be supposed that Moliere and Fielding were ignorant of the rules of the drama nevertheless in their best farces they totally lost fight of them appearing to have nothing in view but whimsical characters and laughable situations  The humour and characters of  the Invasion  in some places have been censured as low but surely the same charge holds good against the the most celebrated writers Smollett Fielding Gay Cervantes all descended to the humble walk of life in search of Humour and never rejected her for the homeliness of her garb It is true that if painting low life be a fault those distinguished wits were possessed of beauties sufficient to eclipse little spots in their reputation The writer of  the Invasion  feels but too sensibly the humiliating distance he is thrown from them and that whatever his faults are he has nothing to depend upon for hiding them except the candour of his readers The following little entertainment he meant merely as a  farce  and as such  only  he hopes it will be considered and judged of  He cannot conclude without returning his warmest acknowledgments to Mr Garrick for assistances in the Invasion which have contributed more than the merit of the author to its success with the public  The performers in general acquitted themselves with the greatest spirit and propriety particularly Mr Lee Lewes who by his speaking the prologue and his acting Cameleon proved that he was possessed of all those various and versatile powers which constitute the truly capital comedian  PROLOGUE  Written by the AUTHOR  And spoken by Mr LEE LEWES  THE muse in change and fashion still delighting  Now raves of nothing but of camps and fighting  Of mines of ambuscades and heroes slain  Arm'd capapie on the embattled plain  Of CoventGarden or of DruryLane  One night a Camp by candle light she shews  Next an Invasion without wounds or blows  Beneath the arches our encampment nigh  Where walking belles and Irish chairmen ply  Where playbills spread seem like a centinel  To guard the entrance of the citadel  A crowd whose wonder our Invasion rais'd  With curious comment on each playbill gaz'd  Expecting nothing less than war and plunder  And cannon louder than the rattling thunder  An honest tar with his dear Sue in tow  Whom he from Wapping brought to see the show  Hearing debates run high upon this night  Put in his word to set his neighbours right  "Avast my masters and I'll let you know  "What these folks mean by their Invasion shew  "Don't you perceive th' Invasion's all a skit  "To laugh at Monsieurs for their want of wit  "Invade us boys why sluice my English blood  "And send me home with all my timbers wood  "If I Ben Block with half the British fleet  "Would not these Parleyvous most soundly beat  "Aye damn me wou'd I or I'd lose my life  "And then the King God bless him keeps my wife"  An Irish blade who heard this heart of oak  Replied "My honey I believe you joke  "Did not Monsieur Thurot last war sail post  "T' invade Old England on the Irish coast  "Faith and he did an hell had been to do  "But that brave Elliot shot him thro' and thro'  "Which so surpriz'd him as along he cruiz'd  "To fight no more he begg'd to be excus'd"  Thus Britons rudely that great spirit shew  Which always conquer'd and chastis'd her foe  That spirit of such energy divine  Clouds and misfortunes make it brighter shine  Perfidious Gaul now feels this country's might  Asham'd to yield and yet afraid to fight  Pursue your triumph Britons strike the blow  That humbles in the dust your faithless foe  That side which justice strength and valour take  Honour and conquest never will forsake  DRAMATIS PERSONAE  MEN  Sir John Evergreen  Mr Quick  Charles Evergreen  Mr Whitfieid  Beaufort  Mr Mahon  Cameleon  Mr Lee Lewes  Drill  Mr Wewitzer  Roger  Mr Egan

SCENE  a Room in an Inn at  Brighthelmstone  Charles Evergreen  in a Ridingdress discovered sitting at a Table with Mr  Beaufort  Wine before them  Cameleon  in waiting  Beauf  COME Charles fill your glasshere's reformation to your father  Drinks  Charles  With all my soul for sure never was reformation more wanted since shaving became fashionable in Russia  Beauf  I have not seen Emily this month as he knows she has a fortune of ten thousand pounds independent of him he keeps her a close prisoner and to such an excess does this military mania hurry him that I believe in my conscience he would prefer a serjeant of invalids or a Chelsea pensioner to your discarded friend for a soninlaw  Charles  I left Oxford with a full persuasion that your influence would have reconciled us  Beau  My influence Charles ceased the moment I refused to quit the bar and purchase a commission In vain did I expostulate and represent the  ridicule as a lawyer I must incur by going into the army He continued inflexible asserted Old England was in danger daily of an invasion and that every man who had a regard for her laws and constitution should now fight for them  Cam  Then Sir it seems he is in great dread of an invasion  Beauf  In such dread of it that he has got a serjeant and a drummer that are down here on a recruiting party to teach him his exerciseNay I am told he intends sinking a trench round Evergreen Hall and converting it into a garrison  Cha  I suppose he's the jest of the whole county  Beauf  Why faith novery few know any thing about him Brighthelmstone during the season is too much engaged with scandal and gallantrythen his house standing so far out of the town  Cha  'Sdeath if instead of banishing me for faults he was guilty of himself at my age he had clapped a sword into my hand and bade me fight for my country he'd have acted like an Englishman and a good father but an old fellow of sixty troubled three or four times a year with the gout to think of going into the armyhe may as well think of a wife  Beauf  I suppose you have heard that your old aunt Lady Catherine Rouge passed this summer for the first time at his house She Sir is my most formidable enemy Would you believe it Charles The old lady actually made love to me and because I did not return her overtures with all the warmth she expected like a true woman she most cordially hates me  Cam  She doesMore shame for you Sir to put it in her power  Beauf  Why Camelion sure you don't suppose I could make love to a woman old enough to be my grandmother  Cam  Aye to your grandmother herself provided that was the only method you had left to obtain the real mistress of your heart Now had I been in your situation and she had been as withered as a mummy without a tooth in her head or a hair of any colour to boast of I'd have been at her feet from morning till night swore that she had a Cupid in every wrinkle that I loved her more than Antony did Cleopatra and that if the Goddess of Discord threw another golden apple upon earth to be given to the fairest and appointed me judge her Ladyship without having a tooth to eat it should have had the pippin before tomorrow morning  Beauf and Cha  Ha ha ha  Beauf  Why Cameleon you are a wit and from some of your slights I should conclude a piece of a scholar  Cam  It is no matter what I am Sir I wish to serve my master and serve you too Sir and I think I can do it provided my master is not altogether so squeamish as his friend  Cha  What are you driving at Cameleon  Cam  I only hope Sir that you are not so refined in your notions of beauty as Mr Beaufort and that provided it is your interest you can mistake the snow upon an old sapless trunk for blossoms and green leaves and swear you feel the heat of the Dogdays in the month of December But to wave metaphor I hope Sir you will think that Lady Catherine has still some charms left  Cha  Why you rascal have you forgot she is my aunt  Cam  Your aunt What then Has not she a great deal of money And don't you think it would be a pity to let it go out of the family Has she ever seen you  Cha  Not since I was eight years old when I remember she has often taken me on her knee patted  my cheek played with my ringlets and called me her little Adonis  Cam  Then Sir you must now return the compliment you must take her upon your knee pat her cheeks play with her ringlets and call her your fullgrown Venus  Cha  Psha fool this will never take A woman that has lived in the sphere she has  Cam  Will believe any handsome young fellow who tells her he is love with her The sphere she has lived in 'Sdeath Sir do you suppose women of quality live in the sphere of Dian or are all born under Virgo It might have been so formerly but the present race are certainly under the influence of warmer planets A woman of quality expects lovers to the last moment of her life and as the kings of France from excess of respect are supposed never to die so a woman of fashion from excess of gallantry is supposed never to cease to be beautiful A woman such as Lady Catherine like ice before the sun will dissolve at the blaze which surrounds a fine young fellow  Cha  O your humble servant Sir  Cam  I am right in my philosophy  Beau  I relish your scheme exceedingly Cameleon The old lady Charles is as rich as a Jew and can do any thing with your father Now if you play your cards skilfully you may with ease draw her into such a ridiculous situation that she'll be glad to purchase your silence at any rate  Cam  Sir you have hit it Make love to her and afterwards discard me as a blockhead or stone me for a false prophet if it prove not the means of all your debts being paid and you being reconciled to your father as firmly as ever Here waiter bring pen ink and paper  Enter Waiter with Pen Ink and Paper  Write to her immediately and intreat an interview which I'm sure she'll grant  Cha  And what name am I to assume  Sits down  Cam  What nameWhy let me seeSuppose you borrow Sir George Narcissus's namehe's your intimate friend and as utterly unknown in person to Lady Catherine as you are  Cha  Enough  Sits down and writes  Waiter bring a candle  Cam  I have a scheme to serve you too Mr Beaufort  Beau  I thank you Cameleon but that I know to be out of your power  Cam  Don't think slightly of my power till you are better acquainted with it What would you think if I procured you an interview with Miss Evergreen this very afternoon  Beau  Think that you are Machiavel himself  Enter Waiter with a Candle  But pr'ythee tell me how you propose effecting this  Cam  You have no objection to wearing a livery  Beau  None in the world  Cha  Impudent rascal The next question I suppose you'll ask him is whether he'll go on board wages  Cam  Then Sir I'll assume the character of the celebrated Enamel the dentist from London I lived with him two years and whenever I please we are as like as two eye teeth You shall pass as my servant and in this disguise we will visit Sir John as recommended by Colonel Platoon his particular friend in London to give him a new set of teeth and a left eye that he may look like a soldier when he goes into the militia  Beauf  But what end will this answer  Cam  Why Sir while I am amusing Sir John with all the fashionable jargon of a firstrate dentist you will have an opportunity of conversing with your mistress and of assuring her that if she will consent you will deliver her this night  Beauf  This night Camelion  Cam  This night Sir if there's faith in manYou know he is always raving of an invasion that's my engine I'll unsold my plot on our way to EvergreenHall you may depend I think on its success when Sir John's character is considered therefore employ all your eloquence with your mistress for nothing but her disapprobation of our plan can defeat it  Beauf  If it succeeds I will make your fortune  Cam  Have you finished the loveletter to your aunt yet Sir  Cha  I have just sealed it  Cam  Sealed it what before I saw the contents of it  Cha  Why sirrah do you think I want your assistance to write a letter  Cam  But lord Sir a love letter is such a different kind of letter from all other letters that without great practice there is no such thing as writing one especially to an elderly ladyfor after a certain period the taste becomes so callous it relishes nothing that is not seasoned very highHave you put darts and flames enough into it  Cha  Aye enough to burn the messenger's fingers  Cam  Then give it to me SirI will send it to her Ladyship piping hot by an old fellow servant whose livery and face I am sure she knows nothing ofAway my mastersvictory attend us and laurels shall crown us  Exeunt  SCENE  a DressingRoom  Lady  Catherine Rouge  at her Toilette  Sally  in waiting  Lady C  There is certainly something in these country glassesthey make a perfect fright of oneI can't bear myself in any of themthey shew as little breeding in their reflections as their savage owners  Sally  For my part I don't think they are fit for such a one as your Ladyship to look into indeed they are well enough for a poor sarvant like me or your middling folks in the country  Lady C  But it is no wonder I look illI have have not had an hour's restIt was three you know before I got into bed and I had scarce clos'd my eyes when a concert of rooks and pigeons began to serenade me and kept me awake till sixthese soft musicians had scarce given me a little respite when the grenadiers march struck up diredtly under my windowthen pop pop went the musquets for three or four hours tearing my poor head to pieces till what with the noise and fretting I almost lost my senses  Sally  Lord your Ladyship it was Sir John and his servants that made all that racket and uproarHe has got a serjeant and a drummer from Brighthelmstone to teach him his exerciseIf your Ladyship was to see him and Roger the carter and William the postillion marching and desiling about and turning out their toes and handling their arms you'd die with laughing As sure as can be the poor gentleman is not right in his mindthe thoughts of this invasion has turn'd his brain  Enter a Servant  Serv  A gentlewoman who says her name is Mrs Brussels desires to see your Ladyship immediately  Lady C  Shew her up instantly  Exit Servant  As I live Mrs Brussels the millener from Saint James's Placebut run Sally yourself and bring her to me that blundering fool will make some mistake  Sally  She's here your Ladyship  Enter Mrs  Brussells  in a RidingHabit Lady  Catherine  runs and embraces her  Lady C  My dear Brussels this is most kindwho could have expected you at such a distance from London  Brus  Takes a chair  I must rest myself dear Lady Catherine without ceremonyYou see what a figure I cutI just popt out of the dilly where I've been almost suffocated and squeez'd to death between a fat parson and a greasy cook wench who were coming down to Brighthelmstone for employment I have news for youLady Betty is brought to bed and is to be married next Thursday se'ennight  Lady C  Seriously  Brus  You may depend upon itbut not a syllable transpired  Lady C  And was there no whisperno little illnatur'd stories spread  Brus  There were a few squibs in the newspapers but these are so common now that even when they are true nobody believes them  Lady C  Have you heard how Harriet Rattle settled her quarrel with Lady Sophia  Brus  In a very awkward mannerThe military spirit you know is grown so fashionable that Miss Harriet absolutely challenged her and they would actually have sought only the person whom Lady Sophia had trusted to provide pistols discovered the whole affair to my Lord who went immediately to a magistrate and had both the ladies bound over  Lady C  Ha ha ha brave Harriet what a loss has the king sustain'd in her being oblig'd to wear a petticoat  Brus  Harriet's conduct was punctiliously honourableShe sneer'd at the ridiculous ceremony of binding over but in order to evade it set off for the Netherlands about ten days ago leaving this laconic billet with Lady Sophia"You'll hear of "me at Lisle"  Lady C  And did Lady Sophia follow her  Brus  Only she was taken in labour she would but it is thought that as soon as she is able to travel she will go off post to prevent her honour being question'd  Lady C  You certainly Brussels are a most entertaining creature your conversation is a perfect cordialany thing new in your own way  Brus  Nothing my Lady except the thunder caps  Lady C  Thunder caps Heav'ns Brussels what do you mean Thunder caps  Brus  They are quite the ton and all my own inventionSo many accidents happen'd to the heads of my customers this summer from lightning that I have contriv'd caps with conductors in them which will enable a lady to walk with her head two yards high in the most violent thunder storm without danger  Lady C  I hope you have brought one with you  Brus  O yes here it is    Pulls out an extravagant  cap    and not that I say it as highly finished as any cap from this to Parisand one I'll insure safe wearing too in all weathers  Lady C  Any thing else  Brus  NoI have been out of rumps these six weeks indeed I don't think it worth wasting cork on 'em nownot one called for from morning till nightI have remarked that since the French war was first talk'd of and so many new regiments raised it has been quite unfashionable to make any unnatural addition to the shapes  Enter Servant with a Letter which he delivers to Lady  Catherine  Lady C  Who brought this letter  Servant  A servant in livery your Ladyship he waits for an answer  Lady C  You'll excuse me Brussels  Breaks the Seal and reads  "Madam"  Permit me with the most awful respect to divulge "a secret which has prey'd upon my peace "for

rattle my chains without being "able to break them like a squirrel in his cage "always ringing his bells but never to any tune" It is really very facetious "Grant me then divine "creature an interview

telling my servant "there is no answer will be to me full answer for "I will not offend your delicacy by expecting you  "to write to me"He must be a man of quality by his breeding"I am divine creature

haven't cause  Gives her the Letter  Such a man was framed to make a woman falseThen he writes good Gods how he does write  Brus  As sure as can be this is Sir George Narcissus brother to the colonel  Lady C  Then you know him Brussels  Brus  I know his brother of the guards as well as I know your Ladyship but I never saw the baronet I am told though he is one of the finest young fellows in England  Lady C  O Brussels is he  Brus  And remarkable for his taste  Lady C  That I think he has given a pretty good proof of  Brus  And has got an estate of eight thousand pounds per annum  Lady C  O do not mention that Brussels for what is fortune to the wish of love "A miserable bankrupt" as the tender Tancred says  Enter  Emily  Em  My dear Lady Catherine have you spoken to my father about Charles This moment I heard he was at BrighthelmstoneIf you would let me flip out to see him I would be back immediately  Lady C  By no means Emily what would your father say if you were to go off with Beaufort A girl with ten thousand pounds at her own disposal is not to be trusted every where  Em  But sure you may depend on my word when I promise to come back  Lady C  Lord Child when the heart is once touch'd there's no answering for a woman's conductI can't answer for my own in such a case Eh Brussels  Em  But have you said any thing in poor Charles's favour to my father  Lady C  Not I upon my wordI am determined never to open my lips in favour of such a wild thoughtless inconsiderate spendthriftHe is not like Sir George  Apart to Brussels  Brus  Sir George your Ladyship  Lady C  O the dear man But you must go with me Brussels I shall be in such a flutter I shall certainly faint and discover that our passion is mutual before I open my lips  Em  Dear aunt let me intreat your intercession in my favour  Lady C  I must insist Miss Emily that you retire to your chamber I wonder you are not ashamed of exposing your passion for a fellow in this mannerBut I must leave you I have so much business at present of my own that I have very little time to mind other people'sCome Brussels and help me to prepare for this affecting interview  Exeunt Lady  Catherine  and  Brussels  Em  Poor Charles I am the only friend thou hast in this house and the only one who cannot serve theeIf Beaufort has not left the country in consequence of my father's ill treatment he will be your firm friendBeaufort how my heart trembles at that name and how active is fancy to torment with hopes which are now no more  SONG  I  What painful moments counts the maid  Whose faithful bosom still  Retains the image love hath made  Against a parent's will  II  No morn that shakes its rosy wings  Dawns peace upon her breast  And night that balmy slumber brings  To her affords no rest  III  In vain she hopes that time will prove  What absence could not give  For should she cease one hour to love  She'd cease that hour to live  IV  Thus deep within the wounded heart  The fatal arrow lies

them as well as if they had tower mark onI'll tell you a story of a jack bootThe first battle I was ever in being a mere boy as a man may say you must know I was devilishly frightened but a goodnatur'd grenadier observing my confusion whips me off a jack boot from the leg of a trooper whose brains were just blown out and intrench'd me up to the chin in it in the twirling of a ramrod as soon as I found myself Sir safely garrisoned in the boot I bent my knees to take every advantage of my post and damn me if I did not maintain it with the greatest steadiness till the battle was over without receiving a single wound but one and where do you think that was  Sir J  Perhaps in the toesthat part of a jack boot I know is apt to go first  Drill  It was in the lace of the hind sirk of my hat which happen'd to be too much exposed above the boot to the fire of the enemyWhat do you think of a jack boot now  Tat  Split my drum sticks how you do fling the hatchet Serjeant  Drill  Why do

battle of Fontenoy at eight years old  Drill  So I was sirrahI went there with a fife in my hand and behaved so well that I was promoted to a drum as soon as ever I was able to carry one and had the honour of scourging the whole regiment  Sir J  But let us see about the bootsHere Roger  Calls  Enter  Roger  Roger  Did your worship call  Sir J  Yes bring me the old boots that are hanging up over

rascals being drawing them on lately  Roger  Drawing them on your worship ecod I defy anybody to do that for they are as stiff as a deal board and one of them would be enough to boot such a one as I

Sir J  What business has a girl like you with affections  Emily  Did you not countenance Mr Beaufort's addresses nay was not the very day fixed for our marriage  Sir J  Yes but I have changed my mind the fellow was mean enough to prefer fighting with words and parchment in Westminster Hall to the glorious danger of the field of battle If he had purchased a pair of colours with his last shilling I would have given you to him at once for he might one day become a general but he shall never have a daughter of mine till he acquires spirit enough to consider a good soldier a better character than the Lord Chancellor  Enter a Servant  Serv  A gentleman who came to the door in a chariot desires to speak with you Sir  Tat  Then we'll make ourselves scarce  Sir J  Step down to the pantry and get

owing to neglectperhaps you don't use water glasses after dinner  Sir J  Water glasses  Cam  But now I mention water glasses it reminds me of a whimsical accident which happen'd last week at Lord Whiffle's His Lordship had a large party to dine with him all people of tip top fashion and my customers could not have swallowed a mouthful for all that but for me amongst others Lady Mary Madeup who had got in that day an entire new set upon trial from Signor Grinini they were highly finished and Lady Mary did the artist ample justice for she was upon the broad grin during the whole time of dinner  Sir J  Oh that's a mark of good breeding among your people of fashion  Cam  After dinner as she was sipping from her water glass an aukward booby of a servant jostled her elbow and drove the edge of the glass with  such violence against her fore teeth that the whole set bounced into her lap in a twinklingEvery body stared not so much at the accident as it was one might have happened to most of themselves as at the prodigious alteration it made in Lady Maryher cheeks which appeared as round and as plump as a peach shrunk into wrinkles her lips fell in her nose and chin approached and from a fine blooming girl of five and twentybefore the cloth was removed she was hagged into an antiquated maiden of threescore  Sir J  Ha ha haA very good story 'Sdeath if it were possible for such an accident to befal me I should never be able to shew my face again  Cam  You need not fear Sir if you deal with me But be so good Sir as to open your mouth a little wider  Sir J  Open my mouth a little wider  Cam  A gentle curl upon your cheek just an inclination to a smile  Sir J  A smile why zounds do you think I am angry with you for telling this story  Cam  Aside  Now to amuse my old friend while the lovers talk a little    Looking as in great surprize at  Beaufort  Ha John what's the matter Are you taken ill  Beau  I don't know what's the matter with me Sir but I have such a strange unaccountable something or other come over me  Sir J  The devil you have but I suppose you have been drinking this morning you rascal  Cam  No no I am sure he hasn'tJohn is a very sober fellow but he's very subject to fits one of which he will most certainly have unless he gets a little cordial to revive him  Sir J  He shall have a bumper of brandy if that will do him any goodHere Emily go give this  poor fellow a glass of brandy give him two if he will take them  Em  I shall obey your commands SirHow fortunate    Aside    Exeunt  Beaufort  and  Emily  Cameleon  pulls out a large Box    Cam  Sir I challenge Europe to match the set I have broughtthey have the polish of porcelainthe whiteness of alabaster and the clearness and delicacy of pearl and for strength from a silbert to a walnut there is not such a pair of nutcrackers in the kingdom and I'll engage them all genuine elephants  Sir J  Elephants Zounds sure this fellow does not think because I am going into the army that I'll make war like the great Mogul upon the back of an elephant  Aside  Cam  Scarce one person in twenty Sir has got a decent set of teeth  Sir J  Damn their teeth what are their teeth to me  Cam  Why certainly nothing Sir you are only to take care of your own  Sir J  What is this fellow driving at  Aside  But come Sir whatever business you have with me dispatch it as I can't stand chattering
