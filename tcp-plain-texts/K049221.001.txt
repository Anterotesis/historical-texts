opportunity of testifying my sincere respect for YOUR GRACE's exalted character as the friend and as the ornament of your coun∣try by addressing these volumes to a name so much revered and beloved by the nation  whose poetry they are intended to preserve and to illustrate  The chief compositions in this volume MY LORD will be found to breathe the living spirit of the Scotish people a race of men who have left monuments of their martial glory in every country YOUR GRACE it is hoped will with pleasure here recognise the noble ardour your example lately tended to revive by raising and commanding in person a military force in defence of your country at a period when her natives had not discernment to perceive nor spirit to assume the privileges of British subjects  The second volume MY LORD contains chiefly pieces descriptive of rural merriment and of love and domestic happiness Even these it is humbly believed YOUR GRACE will not disdain for it is well known that the felicity of the poor in general and of your numerous tenants and dependants in  particular is regarded by YOUR GRACE as essential to your own In reward YOUR GRACE enjoys a domestic felicity now sel∣dom or never known to the great who are generally obliged to exchange the free en∣joyment of true pleasure for the gaudy sla∣very of ostentation  At a period when many of the British nobility are wasting their patrimonial estates in profligate dissipation men trained to arms in defence of their rights and liberties vil∣lages beautified and rendered salubrious and their inhabitants rendered happy have been the monuments of expence of the DUKE OF BUCCLEUGH  The silent gratitude of the poor will ever speak YOUR GRACE's praises with an ex∣pression unknown to the most exalted elocu∣tion and it were surely absurd for any wri∣ter to enlarge on what is the common subject  of conversation and known to all I shall not therefore any longer intrude on YOUR GRACE's patience  That SCOTLAND may long consider YOUR GRACE as one of the best guardians of her liberty and the living assertor of her an∣cient spirit is the earnest wish of  MY LORD YOUR GRACE's Most obedient Servant JOHN PINKERTON  CONTENTS

TRAGIC BALLAD  DISSERTATION I ON THE ORAL TRADITION OF POETRY  IT has long been a subject of regret that the inven∣tors of the fine Arts have by oblivion been deprived of the reputation due to their memory Of the many realms which lay claim to their birth Egypt seems to possess the preference Yet like the Nile which ani∣mates that country while they have diffused pleasure and utility over kingdoms their origin remains hid in the most profound obscurity  That poetry holds a distinguished superiority over all these sciences is allowed yet the first practiser of this enchanting art has lost the renown it was designed to confer We must either allow the contested claim of the Osiris of the Egyptians and Apollo of the Greeks or be content to withhold from any the fame which indeed seems due to as many inventors as there are dis∣tinct nations in the world For poetry appears not to  require the labour of disquisition or aid of chance to invent but is rather the original language of men in an infant state of society in all countries It is the effusion of fancy actuated by the passions and that these are always strongest when uncontrouled by custom and the manners which in an advanced community are termed polite is evident But the peculiar advantages which a certain situation of extrinsic objects confers on this art have already been so well illustrated by emi∣nent critics  Particularly Dr Blackwell in his Enquiry into the Life and Writings of Homer and Dr Blair in his elegant Dissertation on the Poems of Ossian  that it is unnecessary here to remember them I have besides noted a few such as immediately concern the compositions now under view in the sub∣sequent Dissertation and only propose here to give a brief account of the utility of the Oral Tradition of Poetry in that barbarous state of society which neces∣sarily precedes the invention of letters and of the cir∣cumstances that conspired to render it easy and safe  Among the Egyptians probably the most ancient authors of the elegant as well as useful sciences we find that verses were originally used solely to preserve the laws of their princes and sayings of their wise men from oblivion  Herodot Diodor Sicul c  These were sometimes inscribed in their temples in their hieroglyphic character but more  frequently only committed to the memory of the ex∣pounders of their Law or disciples of their sages Pythagoras who was initiated in their secret science conveyed in like manner his dictates to his disciples as appears from the moral verses which pass under his name at this day And though the authenticity of these may be questioned yet that he followed this mode of bequeathing his knowledge to his followers is proved from the consent of all antiquity  Jamblichus de vita Pythag  passim  and particularly  lib  I  cap  and  Nay before him Thales composed in like manner his System of Natural Philosophy And even so late as the time of Aristotle the Laws of the Agathyrsi a nation in Sarmatia were all delivered in verse Not to mention the known laws of the Twelve Tables which from the fragments still remaining of them appear to have consisted of short rythmic sentences  From laws and religion poetry made an easy progress to the celebration of the Gods and Heroes who were their founders Verses in their praise were sung on solemn occasions by the composers or bards themselves We meet with many before Homer who distinguished themselves by such productions Fabricius  In Bibliotheca Graeca  tom  I  has enu∣merated near seventy whose names have reached our times That immortal author had the advantage of  hearing their poems repeated and was certainly in∣debted to his predecessors for many beauties which we admire as original That he was himself an ΑΟΙΔΟΣ or Minstrel and sung his own verses to the lyre is shown by the admirable author of the Enquiry into his Life and Writings  Sect VIII  Nor were his poems rescued from the uncertain fame of tradition and committed to wri∣ting till some time after his death  Aelian Var Hist lib xiii c    Such was the utility of the poetic tradition among the more polished nations of antiquity and with those they denominated Barbarians we find it no less practised  The reader who would desire more intelligence on this head may consult a curious  Dissertation on the Monuments which supplied the Defect of Writing among the first Historians  by the Abbé Ansesm in Les Memoires de l'Academie des Inscriptions c  The Persians had their Magi who preserved as would seem in this way the remarkable events of former times and in war went before the army singing the praises of their illustrious men whom the extraordinary gratitude and admiration of their countrymen had exalted into Deities If they gained the victory the Song of Triumph recorded the deeds of those who had fallen and by their praises animated the ambition of those who enjoyed the conquest to farther acts of valour The latter custom  was in use still more anciently among the Jews as appears from the songs of Moses  Exod XV  and Deborah  Judges V  preserved in Sacred Writ  The Druids of Gaul and Britain afford a noted in∣stance  Et Bardi quidem fortia virorum illustrium facta heroicis com∣posita versibus cum dulcibus lyrae modulis cantitarunt  Ammian Marcell  lib xvi  Such firm hold did their traditions take of the memory that some of them are retained in the minds of their countrymen to this very day  Atque horum Bardorum seu Druidarum cantiones aut ad similitudinem potius earundem fictae etiamnum aliquae extant  die

transactions of past times than by verse The brave actions of their ancestors were always sung as an incentive to their imitation before they entered into combat The like we read of the ancient Goths  Jornand See  Warton's Hist of English Poetry  those destroyers of all literature who yet possessed greater skill in the fine arts than is com∣monly ascribed to them From them this custom passed to their descendants the inhabitants of the Northern regions many animated specimens of whose traditio∣nal poetry have been preserved to our times  See the Histories of Saxo Grammat Jo Magnus Torfaeus c  passim  and Dr Percy's  Five Pieces of Runic Poetry  and quoted by their modern historians as uncontroulable vouchers as the Arabian historians refer for the truth of many events to the Spanish romanzes saved in like manner by tradition for many ages many of which are of very remote antiquity and abound with the higher beauties of poetry  Hist de las guerras civiles de Granada  A most beautiful imi∣tation of their manner may be found among the Poems of Voiture The Spanish word  Romanze  seems now applied to any short lyric tale on whatever subject We find in Gongora their most emi∣nent poet  Romances Amorosos y Burlescos  Traditional verses are to this day a favourite amusement of the Mahometan nations though instead of recording the illustrious actions of their real heroes they chaunt the fabled exploits of  Buhalul their Orlando  Huet Lettre à Monsieur Segrais sur l'origine des Romans p LXVII edit d'Amst  or the yet more ridiculous ones of their Prophet  Historiale

Eastern religious poetry may be seen in Sir John Chardin's Voyage to Persia vol I  From them it would appear that rime that great help to the remembrance of tra∣ditional poetry passed to the Troubadours of Provence who from them seem also to have received the spirit and character of their effusions Like them they composed amorous verses with delicacy and nature but when they attempted the sublimer walk of the Heroic Song their imagination was often bewildered and they wandered into the contiguous regions of the incredible and absurd  Huet ubi supra p LXX Ermengarde vicomtesse de

proportion as Literature advanced in the world Oral Tradition disappeared The venerable British Bards were in time succeeded by the Welsh Beirdh  History of Wales by Caradoc of Lhancarvan c p    whose principal occupation seems to have been to pre∣serve the genealogy of their patrons or at times to amuse them with some fabulous story of their predeces∣sors sung to the harp or crowd  This is the instrument meant in the following verses of Ven Fortunatus lib vii  Romanusque lyra plaudat tibi barbarus harpa  Graecus Achilliaca Crotta Britanna canat  See more of the Harp in War Antiq Hibern cap And Mr Evans Dissert de Bardis p  an instrument which Griffith ap Conan King of Wales is said to have brought from Ireland about the beginning of the twelfth century  In like manner among the Caledonians as an inge∣nious writer  Mr Macpherson in his Dissertation on the Era of Ossian p ed  acquaints us  Every chief in process of time had a bard in his family and the office be∣came hereditary By the succession of these bards the poems concerning the ancestors of the family were handed down from generation to generation they were repeated to the whole clan on solemn occa∣sions and always alluded to in the new composi∣tions of the bards  The successors of Ossian were at length employed chiefly in the mean office of preserving fabulous genealogies and flattering the pride of their chieftains at the expence of truth without  even fancy sufficient to render their inventions either pleasing or plausible That order of men I believe is now altogether extinct yet they have left a spirit of poetry in the country where they flourished  See Martin's and other Descriptions of the Western Isles passim  and Ossian's harp still yields a dying sound among the wilds of Morven  Having thus given a faint view of the progress of the Oral Tradition of Poetry to these times  For an account of the more modern minstrels see Dr Percy's Dissertation which is so complete that it leaves nothing to add  I proceed to shew what arts the ancient bards employed to make their verses take such hold of the memory of their countrymen as to be transmitted safe and entire without the aid of writing for many ages These may be considered as affecting the passions and the ear Their mode of expression was simple and genuine They of consequence touched the passions truly and effectively And when the passions are engaged we listen with avidity to the tale that so agreeably affects them and remember it again with the most prompt facility This may be observed in children who will forget no circumstance of an interesting story more especially if striking or dreadful to the fancy when they cannot remember a short maxim which only oc∣cupies the judgement The passions of men have been and will be the same through all ages Poetry is the sovereign of the passions and will reign while they  exist We may laugh at Sir Isaac Newton as we have at Descartes but we shall always admire a Homer an Ossian or a Shakspere  As the subjects of these genuine painters of nature deeply interested the heart and by that means were so agreeable and affecting that every hearer wished to remember them so their mode of constructing their verse was such that the remembrance was easy and expeditious A few of their many arts to aid the me∣mory I shall here enumerate  I Most of these Oral poems were set to music as would appear by the original authors themselves That this was the custom so early as the days of Homer may be seen in the excellent author formerly adduced  Enquiry c Sect VIII  How should we have been affected by hearing a composition of Homer or Ossian  ung and played by these immortal masters themselves With the poem the air seems to have passed from one age to another but as no musical compositions of the Greeks exist we are quite in the dark as to the nature of these I suppose that Ossian's poetry is still recited to its ori∣ginal cadence and to appropriated tunes We find in an excellent modern writer  Mr Warton in his History of English Poetry  that this mode of singing poetry to the harp was reckoned an accomplishment so late as among the Saxon Ecclesiastics The ancient  music was confessedly infinitely superior to ours in the command of the passions Nay the music of the most barbarous countries has had effects that not all the sublime pathos of Corelli or animated strains of Handel could produce Have not the Welsh Irish and Scotish tunes greater influence over the most in∣formed mind at this day than the best Italian concerto What Modern refined music could have the powers of the  Rance de Vaches  See Rousseau Dict de Musique  sur cette article  Though the Swiss are a brave nation yet their dance which corresponds to the  Rance des Vaches  is like their others rather expressive of an effemi∣nate spirit  Les dances des Suisses consistent en un continuel trainement de Jambe ces pas repondoient mal au courage ferme de cette nation Coquillart en son Blazon des armes et des dames  Les Escossoys font les repliques  Pragois et Bretons bretonnans  Les Suisses dancent leurs Moresques  A touts leurs tabourins sonnants  Mons L D Notes à Rabelais Tom IV p  of the Swiss or the melancholy sound of the Indian Bansha  See Grainger's Prosopoetic Account of the Culture of the Sugarcane Book IV  Is not the warmusic of the rudest inhabitants of the wilds of America or Scot∣land more terrible to the ear than that of the best band in the British army Or what is still more surprizing will not the softer passions be more inflamed by a  Turkish air than by the most exquisite effort of a polite composer as we learn from an elegant wri∣ter  Letters of Lady M W Montague XXXIII  whom concurring circumstances rendered the best judge that could be imagined of that subject The harmony therefore of the old traditional songs possessing such influence over the passions at the same time that it rendered every expression necessary to the ear must have greatly recommended them to the remembrance  II Besides musical cadence many arts were used in the versification to facilitate the rehearsal Such were  The frequent returns of the same sentences and descriptions expressed in the very same words As for instance the delivery of messages the description of battles c of which we meet with infinite examples in Homer and some if I mistake not in Ossian Good ones may be found in Hardyknute Part I v c compared with part II v c and in Child Maurice v with v and innumerable such in the ancient Traditional Poetry of all nations These served as land marks in the view of which the memory travelled secure over the intervening spaces On this head falls likewise to be mentioned what we call The Burden that is the unvaried repetition of one or more lines fixing the tone of the poem throughout the whole That this is very ancient among the barbaric nations may be gathered from the known Song of Regner  Lodbrog to be found in Olaus Wormius  Regner Lodbrog King of Denmark flourished in the Ninth Century  every stanza of which begins with one and the same line So many of our ballads both ancient and modern have this aid to the memory that it is unnecessary to condescend on any in particular  Alliteration was before the invention of rime greatly used chiefly by the nations of Northern origi∣nal to assist the remembrance of their traditional poe∣try Most of the Runic methods of versification con∣sisted in this practice It was the only one among the Saxon poets from whom it passed to the English and Scotish  See Hickes  Ling Vet Sept Thes c  From the Saxons he observes that the author of  Pierce Plowman  drew this practice c This poem was written about There is a remarkable similarity in its style and manner with those very curious pieces of ancient Scotish poetry styled The Prophecies of Thomas Rymer Marvellous Merling Beid Berlington Waldhave Eltraine Ba∣nister and Sybilla printed at Edinburgh in and reprinted from that edition vo It is very surprising that the re∣spectable editor of  Ancient Scottish Poems from the MS of George Bannatyne    Edin  seems to regard these as not more ancient than the time of Queen Mary His reasons are only founded on the modern appearance of some particular passages That they have been modernized and corrupted I will readily allow but that they are on the main nearly as ancient as Rymer's time who died about the beginning of the th Century I believe the learned must confess from intrinsic evidence in such cases the surest of all Not to mention that Sir David Lindsay who wrote in the reign of James V is an undoubted witness that they must be more ancient than this eminent Antiquary would infer For in enumerating the methods he took to divert that prince while under his care in his infancy after condescending on some risible cir∣cumstances as  Whan thou wast young I bare thee in my arm  Full tenderly till thou began to gang  And in thy bed oft happed thee full warm  With lute in hand than sweetly to thee sang  Sometime in dancing fiercefully I flang  And sometimes playing fairses on the flure  And sometimes of mine office taking cure  And sometimes like a feind transfigurate  And sometimes like a greesy ghost of gay  In divers forms oft times disfigurate c  He adds  The Prophesies of  Rymer Bede  and  Merlin  And many other pleasant history  Of the red  Erin  and  Gyre Carlin  Comforting thee when that I saw thee sory  Episile to the King prefixed to his Dream  They begin thus  Merling says in his book who will read right  Althouch his sayings be uncouth they shall be true found  In the seventh chapter read who so will  One thousand and more after Christ's birth  Then the Chalnalider of Cornwall is called  And the wolf out of Wales is vanquished for aye  Then many ferlies shall fall and many folk shall die  This exordium is evidently retouched by a modern handBut very many of the passages seem to stand in their original form as the following lines which are all in the Saxon manner will testify  And derfly dung down without any doome  A proud prince in the preis lordly shall light  With bold Barons in bushment to battle shall wend  There shall a galyart goat with a golden horn  And many similar That prophecy which bears the name of Thomas Rymer is not destitute of poetic graces It opens with the following lines  Still on my ways as I went  Out throuch a land beside a lee  I met a bairn upon the bent  Modernized  way  though against the rime    Methought him seemly for to see  I asked him wholly his intent  Good Sir if your will be  Since that ye bide upon the bent  Some uncouth tidings tell you me  When shall all these wars be gone  That leil men may live in lee  Or when shall Fasehude go from home  And Lawtie blow his horn on

of Pierce Plowman every English poem of note in those days being soon succeeded by an imitation in Scotland  When rime became common this which  was before thought to constitute the sole difference between prose and verse was still regarded as an acces∣sary  grace and was carried to a ludicrous length by some poets of no mean rank in both nations So  late as the reign of Queen Elizabeth we find the fol∣lowing lines in a court poet  Princes puff'd barons blustered lords began lowr  Knights storm'd squires startled like steeds in a stowr  Pages and yeomen yelled out in the hall  King Ryence's Challenge  in the Reliques of Ancient English Poetry  Vol  III  p      And William Dunbar the chief of the old Scotish poets begins a copy of verses to the King thus  Sanct Salvator send silver sorrow  Bannatyne's Scottish Poems p    I asked him wholly his intent  Good Sir if your will be  Since that ye bide upon the bent  Some uncouth tidings tell you me  When shall all these wars be gone  That leil men may live in lee  Or when shall Fasehude go from home  And Lawtie blow his horn on hie  I looked from me not a mile  And saw twa knights upon a lee c  I imagine however they are all the composures of one hand and if I may use a conjecture were written immediately after the visions of Pierce Plowman every English poem of note in those days being soon succeeded by an imitation in Scotland  III But the greatest assistance that could be found to the tradition of poetry was derived from the invention of rime which is far more ancient than is commonly believed One of the most learned men this age has produced  Le Clerc Biolioth Universelle tom IX  has shewn that it is common in Scripture All the Psalms consist of riming verses and many other passages which he names They were used among the Greeks so early as the time of Gorgias the Sicilian who taught the Athenians this practice And though the spirit of the Greek and Latin languages did not always admit of them in poetry yet they were used as occasional beauties by their most celebrated writers Homer Hesiod and Virgil have a few though ap∣parently more from chance than design The ancient Saturnine verses were all rimes as an old commentator  Servius ad Georg II ver  informs us And it is more than probable they were so constructed merely that the memory might the more easily preserve them their licence forbidding their being committed to writing Those who would wish to know more particularly the universality of this mode of versifying among the other ancient nations may consult the  Huetiana  of the most learned and respect∣able Bishop of Avranches  Sect  The Eastern poetry con∣sists altogether if I mistake not of riming lines as may be observed in the specimens of Hafiz their most  illustrious writer lately published  Jones Comment Poeseos AsiaticaeRichardson's Specimen of Persian Poetry  It appears how∣ever that alliteration supplied the place of rime with the Northern nations till within a recent period  Ol Worm Lit Run p  Ossian's poetry I suppose is in stanzas something like our ballad measure though it were to be wished the translator had favoured us with some information on this head evidenced by specimens of the original He indeed acquaints us that  Each verse was so con∣nected with those which preceded or followed it that if one line had been remembered in a stanza it was almost impossible to forget the rest  Dissert on the Era of Ossian p ed    but this stands greatly in need of explanation  The common ballad stanza is so simple that it has been used by most nations as the first mode of con∣structing rimes The Spanish romanzes bear a great resemblance in this as in other respects to the Scotish Ballads In both every alternate line ends with similar vowels though the consonants are not so strictly at∣tended to As for instance in the former we have  bana espada mala palabra vega cueva rompan vol∣canos  for rimes and in the later  m  dale girdle keep bleed Buleighan tak him  c The English even in the ruder pieces of their first minstrels seem to have  paid more attention to the correspondence of their con∣sonants as may be observed in the curious Collection published by Dr Percy  As the simplicity of this stanza rendered it easy to the composer and likewise more natural to express the passions so it added to the facility of recollection It's tone is sedate and slow The rimes occur seldom and at equal distances though when a more violent passion is to be painted by doubling the rimes they at once expressed the mind better and diversified the harmony Of this the reader will observe many instances in this collection as  Here maun I lie here maun I die Like beacon bricht at deid of nicht Na river heir my dame  deir  c and to give a very solemn movement to the cadence they sometimes tripled the rime an instance of which may be observed in the first stanza of Child Maurice  When all the circumstances here hinted at are consi∣dered we shall be less apt to wonder that by the concurrence of musical air retentive arts in the com∣position and chiefly of rime the most noble produc∣tions of former periods have been preserved in the me∣mory of a succession of admirers and have had the good fortune to arrive at our times pure and uncor∣rupted  DISSERTATION II ON THE TRAGIC BALLAD  THAT species of poetry which we denominate Ballad is peculiar to a barbarous period In an advanced state of arts the Comic Ballad assumes the form of the Song or Sonnet and the Tragic or Heroic Ballad that of the higher Ode  The cause of our pleasure in seeing a mournful event represented or hearing it described has been attempted to be explained by many critics  Aristotle Scaliger Dubos Trapp in his Praelections Hume Essay on Tragedy but above all Mr Burke in his Enquiry into the Sublime and Beautiful  It seems to arise from the mingled passions of Admiration of the art of the author Curiosity to attend the termination De∣light arising from a reflection on our own security and the Sympathetic Spirit  In giving this pleasure perhaps the Tragic Ballad yields to no effort of human genius When we peruse a polished Tragedy or Ode we admire the art of the author and are led to praise the invention but when we read an unartful description of a melancholy event our passions are more intensely moved The laboured productions of the informed composer resemble a Greek or Roman temple when we enter it we admire the art of the builder The rude effusions of the Gothic Muse are like the monuments of their Architecture We are filled with a religious reverence and forgetting our praise of the contriver adore the present deity  I believe no Tragic Ballad of renowned Antiquity has reached our times if we deny the beautiful and pathetic CARMEN DE ATY in Catullus a title to this class which as a modern critic of note has observed  Essay on the writings and genius of Pope  p  d  ed  seems a translation from some Greek  Dithyrambic  The  Dithyrambics  were Heroic Songs written with the highest glow of poetic fancy in honour of the ancient deities Aristotle informs us that the Greek Tragedy originated from them as their Comedy did from their Pastoral Love Songs  far more ancient than the times of that poet His translation of Sappho's Ode might shew that he took a delight in the ancient Greek compositions from which indeed he seems to have derived in a great measure his peculiarly delicate vein  But it was with the nations in a state of barbarity that this effusion of the heart flourished as in it's pro∣per soil their societies rude and irregular were full of vicissitudes and every hour subject to the most dreadful accidents The Ministrels who only knew and were inspired by the present manners caught the tale of mortality and recorded it for the instruction and en∣tertainment of others It pleased by moving the pas∣sions and at the same time afforded caution to their auditors to guard against similar misadventures  It is amusing to observe how expressive the poetry of every country is of its real manners That of the Northern nations is ferocious to the highest degree Nor need we wonder that those whose laws obliged them to decide the most trifling debate with the sword  Frotho etiam III Danorum rex quemadmodum Saxo lib V refert de qualibet controversia ferre decerni sanxit speciosius vi∣ribus quam verbis confligendum existimans  Schedius de diis Ger Syng  II  c    delighted in a vein of poetry which only painted deeds of blood and objects horrible to the imagination The ballad poetry of the Spaniards is tinged with the romantic gallantry of the nation The hero is all complaisance and takes off his helmet in the heat of combat when he thinks on his mistress That of the English is generous and brave In their most noble ballad Percy laments over the death of his  mortal foe That of the Scots is perhaps like the face of their country more various than the rest We find in it the bravery of the English the gallantry of the Spanish and I am afraid in some instances the ferocity of the Northern  A late writer  Miscellanies by John Armstrong MD vol II p  has remarked that  the Scottish tunes whether melancholy or gay whether amorous martial or pastoral are in a style highly original and most feelingly expressive of all the passions from the sweetest to the most terrible  He proceeds  Who was it that threw out those dreadful wild ex∣pressions of distraction and melancholy in  Lady Cul∣ross's Dream  an old composition now I am afraid lost perhaps because it was almost too terrible for the ear  This composition is neither lost nor is it too terri∣ble for the ear On the contrary a child might hear it repeated in a winter night without the smallest emo∣tion A copy  It is intituled  A Godly Dream compiled by Elizabeth Melvil Lady Culross younger at the request of a friend  Edinburgh mo p It is either reprinted from some former edition or from a MS It was written I conjecture about the end of the Sixteenth Century but in this edition I suspect seve∣ral expressions are modernized and altered to accommodate it to the common capacity  The lady Culross here meant was Elizabeth daughter of Sir James Melvil of Halhill and wife of John Colvil Commendator of Culross She is believed to have been the mother of Samuel Colvil the satyrical poet author of the Scots Hudibras c  of it now lies before me and as some  curiosity may have been raised by the above remark I shall here give an account of it The dreadful and melancholy of this production are solely of the religious kind and may have been deeply affecting to the enthu∣siastic at the period in which it was written It begins thus  Upon a day as I did mourn full sore  For sundry things wherewith my soul was grieved  My grief increased and grew more and more  I comfort fled and could not be relieved  With heaviness my heart was sore mischieved  I loathed my life I could not eat nor drink  I might not speak nor look to none that lived  But mused alone and diverse things did think  This wretched world did so molest my mind  I thought upon this false and iron age  And how our hearts are so to vice inclined  That Satan seems most fearfully to rage  Nothing on earth my sorrow could aswage  I felt my sin so strongly to increase  I grieved the spirit was wont to be my pledge  My soul was plunged into most deep distress  Her Saviour is then supposed to appear in a dream and lead her through many hairbreadth scapes into Heaven  Through dreadful dens which made my heart aghast  He bare me up when I began to tire  Sometimes we clamb oer cragie mountains high  And sometimes stayed on ugly braes of sand  They were so stay that wonder was to see  But when I feared he held me by the hand  Through great deserts we wandered on our way  Forward we past on narrow bridge of tree  Oer waters great which hideously did roar  The most terrible passage to a superstitious ear is that in which she supposes herself suspended over the Gulph of Perdition  Ere I was ware one gripped me at last  And held me high above a flaming fire  The fire was great the heat did pierce me sore  My faith grew weak my grip was very small  I trembled fast my fear grew more and more  My hands did shake that I held him withall  At length they loosed then I began to fall c  At length she arrives in view of the Heavenly man∣sions in a stanza which to alter a little her own ex∣pression 'Glisters with  tinsel  '  I looked up unto that castle fair  Glistering with gold and shining silver bright  The stately towers did mount above the air  They blinded me they cast so great a light  My heart was glad to see that joyful sight  My voyage then I thought it not in vain  I him besought to guide me there aright  With many vows never to tire again  And the whole concludes with an exhortation to a pious life  But what has the Christian religion to do with poetry In the true poetic terrible I believe some passages in Hardyknute yield to no attempt of a strong and dark fancy The Ballad styled Edward may I fear be ra∣ther adduced as an evidence that this displeases when it rises to a degree of the horrible which that singular piece certainly partakes of  The Pathetic is the other principal walk of the Tragic Muse and in this the Scotish Ballads yield to no compositions whatever What can be imagined more moving than the catastrophes of Ossian's Dar∣thula the most pathetic of all poems or of Hardyk∣nute  Child Maurice and indeed most of the pieces now collected Were ever the feelings of a fond mother expressed in a language equal in simplicity and pathos to that of lady BothwellThis leads me to remark that the dialect in which the Scotish Ballads are written gives them a great advantage in point of touching the passions Their language is rough and unpolished and seems to flow immediately from the heart    We meet with no concettos or farfetched thoughts in them They possess the pathetic power in the highest degree because they do not affect it and are striking because they do not meditate to strike  Most of the compositions now offered to the public have already received approbation The mutilated Fragment of Hardyknute formerly in print was ad∣mired and celebrated by the best critics As it is now I am inclined to think given in it's original perfection it is certainly the most noble production in this style that ever appeared in the world The manners and characters are strongly marked and well preserved the incidents deeply interesting and the catastrophe new and affecting I am indebted for most of the stanzas now recovered to the memory of a lady in Lanarkshire  A modern lyric poet of the first class  Mr Gray See his Letters published by Mr Mason Sect IV Let XXV  has pro∣nounced Child Maurice a Divine Ballad  Aristotle's best rules  says he  are observed in it in a man∣ner that shews the author had never read Aristotle  Indeed if any one will peruse Aristotle's Art of Poetry with Dacier's Elucidations and afterwards compare their most approved rules with this simple Ballad he will find that they are better illustrated by this rude effort of the Gothic Muse than by the most exquisite Tragedy of ancient or modern times The Oedipus Tyrannus of Sophocles the Athalie of Racine the Merope of Maffei and even the very excellent Drama which seems immediately founded on it not excepted there being many delicate strokes in this original which the plot adopted by that author forbade his making proper use of This does honour at once to the un∣known composer of this Ballad and to the first of cri∣tics In the former the reader will admire a genius that probably untracked by erudition could produce a story corresponding to the intricate though natural rules of the Greek author To the latter will be readily confirmed the applause of an ancient  Apud Suidam  that he was the secretary of Nature and his pen was ever dipped in good sense  These and the other monuments of ancient Scotish Poetry which have already appeared are in this edi∣tion given much more correct and a few are now first published from tradition The Editor imagined they possessed some small beauties else they would not have been added to this Selection Their seeming antiquity was only regarded as it enhanced their real graces  MDCCLXXVI  * These Dissertations c were written of this date but slight additions have been made to them from time to time as the reader will observe from references to books published since that period    HAVING in the First of the foregoing Dissertations mentioned with applause the Spanish Ballads or Romanzes contained in the HISTORIA DE LAS GUERRAS CIVILES DE GRANADA and that book being seldom to be met with and written in a language of no wide study the Editor has been induced to give a few translations from that work the two which Dr Percy has published having rather excited than gra∣tified curiosity  Before producing these translations it may be pro∣per to give some short account of the work whence they are taken The History of the Civil Wars of Granada is a wellwritten narration of those dissentions which tore that kingdom in pieces for some years be∣fore the period that Ferdinand and Isabella king and queen of Christian Spain conquered it down to the time of conquest The chief sources of those dissen∣tions were the two great  Vandos  or factions of the Zegris and the Abencerrages whose exploits and ad∣ventures with those of their adherents are here dis∣played with a minute detail that savours very strongly of romance though the great outlines of the work are evidently founded on historical truth which if the  reader pleases is indeed only another name for a cer∣tain species of romance  This History as we learn from the work itself to∣wards the close is a translation from the Arabic of an anonymous Moor who fled to Africa with many of his countrymen when Granada was yielded to the arms of Ferdinand His grandson by name Argutaafa found this work among his grandfather's papers and presented it to a Jew called Rabbi Santo who translated it into He∣brew and gave the Arabic Original to Don Rodrigo Ponce de Leon Conde de Baylen That lord being interested by it as his ancestors had been concerned in the wars there related ordered the Jew to translate it into Castillan Spanish and afterwards gave the translation to the Spanish editor whose name from the first edition Barcelona printed by Seb Matevad appears to be Ginez Perez  On almost every occasion the author produces some romanze as the voucher of his incidents translations of a few of which shall now be produced It must however be premised that the first translation is merely meant to convey to the reader an idea of the verse in which most of the originals are written for which purpose one of the feeblest was chosen as had strength of thought or incident been attempted in this way the spirit would have totally evaporated in the midst of attention to the double rimes of which the English language is remarkably penurious  ROMANZE I  I  AT the pleasant dawn of morning  Moorish knights in numbers sally  To maintain a solemn turney  In Granada's verdant valley  II  Justing they wheel their fleet horses  On his lance each warrior steady  Bears a rich and beauteous penon  Wrought with art by his fair lady  III  The bright sun they dazzle shewing  Jupes of silk and golden tissue  Each young hero hopes to soften  His proud dame by that day's issue  IV  From the towers of proud Alhambra  The celebrated palace of the Moorish kings of Granada  Moorish ladies view the trial  And among them two the fairest  Of the court without denial  V  Fatima they and Xarifa  Love on both has play'd his quiver  Thee Xarifa O that Alla  Would from jealousy deliver  VI  Tho friends they for this has silence  O'er them spread his sullen pinion  Fatima the heart has stolen  Of Xarifa's faithless minion  VII  Abendarrez call the rover  Guiltless she of his defection  For of Fatima's firm passion  Abenamar was th' election  VIII  Spoke at length the wrong'd Xarifa  As with scorn her rage to cover  For she thought her friend with favour  Heard the suit of her false lover  IX  'Love cannot be hid my sister  'But himself he still discloses  'Of thy tongue where is the prattle  'Of thy cheeks where are the roses  X  'Thou art not in love I know it  'See the cause of thy condition  'Thy knight Abendarrez tilting  'Hopes the prize with fond ambition  XI  Beauteous Fatima her silence  In wise answer thus has broken  'Never yet did Love Xarifa  'Of my heart receive a token  XII  'If my speech and colour leave me  'It is not without a reason  'Short time since my gracious father  'Died by Alabez's treason  XIII  'And if ever Love my sister  'To his law could bring me over  'Abendarrez should not win me  'From thy charms a cruel rover'  XIV  Thus the Moorish dames have spoken  Then in silence clos'd their prattle  To remark each gallant chieftain  Who maintain'd the seeming battle  ROMANZE II  I  WHEN valiant Ferdinand beheld  Granada to his prowess yield  And o'er Aihambra's highest tower  The banner fly of Christian power  II  Thus to the flower of Spanish ground  His peers and loyal leaders round  The mandates of his mighty breast  The monarch in his pride address'd  III  'Who when the morning springs will go  'Our chief against the mountain foe  'And spread our princely ensign tall  'O'er Alpuxarra's rebel wall  When Ferdinand was occupied with the arquisition of Granada Alp  xa  ra and some other Moorish towns newly conquered took the opportunity to revolt    IV  In silence every troubled peer  Read in each other's face his fear  The journey full of perils great  They knew and doubtful the retreat  V  Each tremulons beard in terror shook  Till from his seat with frowning look  Alonso de Aguilar sprung  And thus bespoke with fearless tongue  VI  'O king for me is this emprize  'And shame or praise that thence may rise  'The queen her sovereign promise gave  'No other the bright claim should have'  VII  With joy the king the valiant heard  Soon as the morrow's dawn appear'd  Alonso with his eager van  To climb Nevada's heights began  VIII  Five hundred horse to battle bred  A thousand infantry he led  The Moors in silent ambush lay  In crowds to guard the rocky way  IX  Amid the pathless cliffs the cry  Of conflict echoes to the sky  The cavalry no footing gain  But fall by stony fragments slain  X  Alonso and the footarray  Sore lessen'd by the bloody fray  At length attain an upland dale  Where countless Moors their ranks assail  XI  Tho bleed around whole bands of foes  Yet who such numbers may oppose  The chief at length beheld his host  In one unbounded slaughter lost  XII  Tho left alone the lionknight  Declines not the unequal fight  Where'er he turns his eyes of fire  As struck by lightning crowds expire  XIII  Fresh Moors possess the bloody field  No longer strong his sword to wield  The victim of a thousand wounds  The shade of death the chief surrounds  XIV  Tho bravely dead each coward Moor  With caitiff lance his body tore  Then to Ogixar they him brought  Where all to see the warrior sought  XV  Each Moor and Moorish dame with joy  Saw him who wont their hopes destroy  No more exert his matchless force  But harmless ly a bleeding corse  XVI  A Christian captive of the crowd  Yet mov'd their tears with outcry loud  For she had nurs'd him at her breast  And in the cradle footh'd his rest  XVII  'Alonso Oh Alonso brave  'May heaven thy generous spirit have  'The Moors of Alpuxara slew  'The bravest knight that fame e'er knew'  ROMANZE III  I  EIGHT to eight and ten to ten  Knights of valour and renown  Turney in Toledo fair  The glad day of peace to crown  II  An high festival the king  Gives his pleasure to evince  Concord reigns between his brother  And Granada's warlike prince  III  Others say the feast is given  Zelindaxa bright to please  Mistress of the king's affection  She ordains him pain or ease  IV  The Zarrazins and Aliatores  There in gallant union ride  The Alari  es and Azarqués  Them oppose with equal pride  V  The Zarrazins a noble band  On sorrel horses there were seen  Their mantles and their jupes distinguish'd  By the orange hue and green  VI  On their shields a cimiter  Bent as Cupid's bow they wore  And the words FUEGO Y SANGRE  Fire and blood    As the chosen motto bore  VII  Equals in the gallant show  Next the Aliatores shone  In carnation garbs array'd  With white foliages bestrown  VII  For device upon the strength  Of Atlas stood a stable heaven  TENDRELO HASTA QUE CANSE  He will support it till be is weary  For the motto there was given  IX  Them ensued the Alarifés  In most costly manner clad  Their sleeves right curiously were purfled  On the yellow cloth and red  X  A naked Hercules they gave  Who a savage monster tore  And above FUERCAS VALEN  Strength is powerful  As the valiant word they wore  XI  Them the eight Azarqués follow'd  And in pride exceeded all  Straw's pale dye and brownish gray  Were their hues of festival  XII  On each chieftain's verdant shield  Held two daring hands a sphere  EN LO VERDE TODO CABE  In the green every thing is comprehended  As the words of honour were  XIII  Among this band the king beheld  The rival of his lady's love  And jealousy his cruel heart  To thoughts of utmost fury drove  XIV  To Selin thus high constable  The sovereign spoke in frantic mood  'The sun that dazzles now mine eyes  'Ere long I trust shall set in blood'  XV  The graceful knight so strongly threw  It was anciently the custom for the Spanish gentry to amuse themselves while on horseback with throwing small rods or canes into the air on darting of which with such force and skill as to delude the eye they much valued themselves  His rods they vanish'd in the air  Nor could the power of keenest eye  Their progress or their fall declare  XVI  Each lady from the windows high  Or scaffolds that enjoy'd the sight  With anxious looks of fond desire  Bent forwards to behold the knight  XVII  As he advances or retires  'May heaven thee save' the vulgar cry  While burnt with jealousy's fierce flames  The king still answers 'Let him die'  XVIII  Bold Zelindaxa sovereign fair  As near the royal tower he drew  Tho 'Hold hold' cried the angry king  Sprinkled the chief with fragrant dew  XIX  The turney stopp'd in silence deep  And expectation stood the ring  While giving reason's rein to rage  'Arrest the traitor' cried the king  XX  The two first troops their lances seize  The princely mandate to fulfill  Alas what barrier can be set  Against an amorous monarch's will  XXI  The other two defence prepar'd  Had not the Azarqué to them said  'Friends tho the king's love has no laws  'Remember laws for your's were made  XXII  'Lower your lances tho my foes  'Ye eager see my blood to spill  'Alas what barrier can be set  'Against an amorous monarch's will  XXIII  They took the noble Moor His friends  Drop'd tears of rage his fate to see  In wild disorder rush'd the croud  By force the captive knight to free  XXIV  They had no chief to guide their ire  And fled before superior skill  Alas what barrier can be set  Against an amorous monarch's will  XXV  Fair Zelindaxa cried aloud  'Rescue ye Moors your warrior brave'  And rose as if she meant to leap  From the high tower her knight to save  XXVI  Her mother her embrac'd and cried  'Ah are you mad yourself to kill  'Alas what barrier can be set  'Against an amorous monarch's will'  XXVII  The furious king a message sent  The mournful damsel to convey  To a lone mansion of her friends  In lasting durance there to stay  XXVIII  'Tell him' she said 'where'er I go  'My firm love shall attend me still  'Alas what barrier can be set  'Against an amorous monarch's will'  ROMANZE IV  This ballad is composed of three different ones on the same subject the first beginning  Por la plaça de San Lucar  the second  Sale la estrella de Venus  and the third  No de tal braveza lleno    I  ALONG San Lucar's ample square  See gallant Gazul ride  In snowey hue array'd and green  And purple's radiant pride  To Gelves he designs to go  His valiant skill to try  In turnament with many a knight  Of high renown to vie  II  The chief a noble dame adores  Of her farewell to take  A thousand anxious turns before  Yon mansion see him make  Lo from the balcony at length  The lovely maid inclines  As o'er a distant hill the morn  In rosy radiance shines  III  Swift from his steed the warrior lights  And kneels upon the ground  As struck with awe such power has love  The valiant to confound  'O fair' he cries with trembling voice  'This day must fame be mine  'What chance can hurt me now that I  'Have seen thy charms divine  IV  'Yet of thy favour I beseech  'Some badge to bear along  It was the custom for ladies to present their lovers with the penon or fireamer they were to wear on their lance in com∣bat or turney The penon was commonly richly inwoven with the lady's cypher  See Stanza XIII    'That with it grac'd my haughty lance  'May as my love be strong'  In jealous rage the maid replied  For then full well she knew  That Zaida his first desire  An elder duty drew  V  'If in the combat thy success  'My heart's desire may crown  'No more false knight shalt thou return  'But life lose and renown  'To God I speak my eager wish  'Sincere as thou dost lye  'That in the fight by secret foes  'Ignobly thou mayst die  VI  'O may thy enemies be strong  'Thy friends all dastards prove  'O be thou dead as is thy fame  'And not even pity move'  The leader thinks she speaks in jest  And thus in haste replies  'The Moor who would us set at strife  'Believe me lady lies  VII  'May all thy curses on him light  'My soul must now abhor  'That Zaida tho wont I own  Her beauty to adore  'After long years of service she  'For a base Moor me left'  The fair retired nor more would hear  Of patience quite bereft  VIII  A page appear'd and gallant steeds  Him brought in rich array  'Return' the frantic warrior cried  'We try no arms this day'  In frenzy then against the wall  That hid his fair from view  So fierce he tilted that his spear  In thousand splinters flew  IX  In anguish now he paus'd a while  Now rode in furious mood  Till madness fired his inmost soul  And prompted deeds of blood  His wandering way to Xerez far  Along the shore he held  Where with her sire his former love  False Zaida now dwell'd  X  The star of eve with golden light  Illumed the western wave  When near to Xerez Gazul drew  As Rodamonte brave  Not he that king of Argel high  When for his fair he strove  With Mandricardo stood in praise  Young Gazul's name above  XI  Now near her mansion with fresh rage  His dauntless bosom burn'd  And thus he spoke while plaintive waves  And rocks the sound return'd  'O Zaida more faithless far  'Than that inconstant sea  'Not half so savage are these rocks  'Not half so hard as thee  XII  'How can'st thou give thy youthful hand  'To him thy suitor old  'And leave the riches of the mind  'For sordid wealth of gold  'Oh may ev'n he thy suitor old  'Thy falshood learn to scorn  'May never love thy anxious nights  'Nor joy thy days adorn  XIII  'At zambra  A moresque dance  nor at festival  'May never knight appear  'Thy cypher on embroider'd sleeve  'Or silken badge to bear  'May jealousy ev'n of his age  'Thy peace still violate  'May he live long Thy fiercest foe  'Can wish no worse a fate'  XIV  Thus as he spoke the gradual night  Descended all around  And as he near the mansion drew  Of mirth he heard the sound  Sudden before a rushing croud  The doors were open thrown  And thro' the gloom in bright array  A thousand torches shone  XV  In midst the future husband held  Young Zaida's false hand  To church they went where stood the priest  To fix the sacred band  This cruel sight when Gazul saw  His madness found new flame  A while he rested till at hand  The brilliant troop now came  XVI  Then spurr'd his steed into the midst  And thus his lady's choice  Address'd while all in sudden fear  Stood trembling at his voice  'Hope not base traitor to enjoy  'This lady once my love  'Defend thyself if e'er thy arm  'Could skill or valour prove  XVII  He spoke They fought The aged Moor  Lay dead upon the ground  Swift to revenge his wretched fall  His numerous friends drew round  Against their force the warrior stood  With more than mortal might  Then slow retreating refuge found  Amid the shades of night  LA PLUPART DE CES CHANSONS SONT DE VIEILLES ROMANCES DONT LES AIRS NE SONT PAS PIQUANS MAIS ILS ONT JE NE SAIS QUOI D'ANTIQUE ET DE DOUX QUI

 HARDYKNUTE This name is of  Danish  extract and signifies  Canute the strong Hardy  in the original implies  strong  not  valiant  and though used in the latter sense by the English yet the Scots still take it in its first acceptation  The names in Cunningham  says Sir David Dalrymple  are all Saxon as is the name of the country itself  An∣nals of Scotland  an    note  The  Danish  and  Saxon  are both derived from the old  Gothic  and were so similar that a person of the one nation might understand one of the other speaking in his proper tongue From the names and whole tenor of  this poem I am inclined to think the chief scene is laid in Cunninghamshire where likewise the  battle of Largs  supposed to be that so nobly described in the first part was fought  Ver  Britons  This was the common name which the Scots gave the English anciently as may be observed in their old poets and particularly  Blind Harry  whose testimony indeed can only be relied on as to the common language and manners of his time his Life of Wallace being a tissue of the most absurd fa∣bles ever mingled  V  Hie on a bill  c This necessary caution in those times when strength was the only protection from violence is well painted by a contemporary French bard  Un chasteau scay sur roche espouvantable  En lieu venteux la rive perilleuse  La vy tyrant seant à haute table  En grand palais en sal plantureuse c  D' Alliac Eveque de Cambray  V  Knicht  These knights were only military officers attending the earls barons c as appears from the histories of the middle ages See Selden  Tit Hon P  II  c  The name is of Saxon origin and of remote antiquity as is proved by the following fragment of a poem on the Spanish expedition of Charles the Great written at that period  Sie zeslugen ros unde

opportuit sanguine fluere  Hic mos erat inter nobiles  milites  Poterant optime pugnare  MS de Bello Car M Hisp apud Keysler diss de Cultu Solis Freji Othini  Halae  The oath which the ancient knights of Scotland gave at their investiture is preserved in a letter of Drummond of Hawthornden to Ben Jonson and is as follows  I shall fortifie and defend the true holy Catholique and Christian Religion presently professed at all my power  I shall be loyal and true to my Sovereign Lord the King his Majesty and do honour and reverence to all orders of che∣valrie and to the uoble office of arms  I shall fortifie and defend justice to the uttermost of my power but feid or favour  I shall never flie from the King's Majesty my Lord and Master or his lieutenant in time of battel or medly with dishonour  I shall defend my native country from all aliens and strangers at all my power  I shall maintain and defend the honest adoes and quarrels of all ladies of honour widows orphans and maids of good fame  I shall do diligence wherever I hear tell there are any traitors murtherers rievers and masterful theeves and out∣laws that suppress the poor to bring them to the law at all my power  I shall maintain aed defend the noble and gallant state of chevalrie with horses harneses and other knichtly apparel to my power  I shall be diligent to enquire and seek to have the know∣ledge of all points and articles touching or concerning my duty contained in the book of chevalry  All and sundry the premises I oblige me to keep and fulfill So help me God by my own hand and by God himself  A curious account of the rise and progress of knight∣hood and its influence on society may be found in a learned and ingenious work lately published by Dr Stuart intitled  A view of Society in Europe or Enquiries concerning the History of Law Government and Manners  V  Emergard  In the common copies it is Elenor and indeed in all the recitals I have heard but in a late edition published with other Scotish songs at Edinburgh it is rightly read as here  Emergard  or  Ermengarde  was daughter of the Viscount of Beau∣mont  and wife of William the Lyon She died in As the name was uncommon and of difficult pronun∣ciation the rehearsers seem to have altered it to  Elenor  which has none of these defects  The battle of Largs supposed to be that meant in this poem was fought on the first of August so that queen Emergard was dead thirty years before yet this can amount to no error in chronology as the verses evidently imply that the lady of Hardyknute  had  no equal in the kingdom for beauty save the queen in the prime of the youth and beauty of both which might well be forty years or more before the period of action in the poem  V  Fairly  This name seems likewise of Saxon origin There is a small island and a rivulet in Cun∣ningham still called  Fairly isle  and  Fairly Burn  V  Twenty thousand glittering speirs  c This agrees with Buchanan's account  Achoviginti millia militum exposuit  lib Torfaeus asserts this number of the Norwegians was left dead on the field but upon what authority I know not as the ancient relations of the battle of Largs support not his testimony See  Johnstone's Translation of Haco's Expedition to Scotland in the year    from the Plateyan and Frisian MSS  printed at Copenhagen  V  Page  The Pages in the periods of chi∣valry were of honourable account The young war∣riers  were first denominated  pages  then  valets  or  damei∣seaux  from which degree they reached that of  ecuyer  or  squire  and from this that of  knight  See  Du Cange  voc  Valeti    Domicellus St Palaye  Mem sur l'anc Cheval  P  I  V  He has tane a horn  c The  horn  or  bugil  was anciently used by the Scots instead of the trumpet They were sometimes richly ornamented as appears from Lindsay's description of that of Sir Robert Coch∣ran  The horn he wore was adorned with jewels and precious stones and tipped with fine gold at both ends  Hist of Scotland  J III  V Westmoreland's  ferce heir    Heir  in the old Scotish acceptation seems derived from the Latin  he∣rus  and signifies not  apparent successor  but  present lord  As in the following lines of  Blind Harry  Of Southampton he hecht baith heir and lord  B c  Of Glocester the huge lord and heir  B c  And in this of  Dunbar  Befoir  Mahoun  the heir of hell  V This minute description might lead us to suspect that a female hand had some part in this composition But before our minstrel Homer has shewn  himself an adept in the lady's dress To the curious remarks on the variation of the British habit given us by Mr Walpole in his  Anecdotes of Painting  and Mr Granger in his  Biographical History  might be added the follow∣ing notice from a reverend minister of the church of Scotland  About the women got a custome of wearing few garments I myselfe have seen the young brisk ladies walking on the streets with masks on their faces and with one onlie thin petticoat and their smoak so thin that one would make a conscience of sweiring they were not naked  Miscellanies by Mr John Bell minister at Gladsmuir  MS pen Edit  title  Apparel  V  Save that of Fairly fair  Working at the needle c was reckoned an honourable employment by the greatest ladies of those times Margaret the queen of Malcolm III as we learn from her life written by  Turgot  her confessor employed the leisure hours of her ladies in this manner See Lord Hales'  Annals of Scotland  an  V  Sir Knicht    The addition  Sir  to the names of knights was in use before the age of Ed∣ward I and is from  Sire  which in old French signifies  Seignieur  or Lord Though applicable to all knights it served properly to distinguish those of the order who were not barons  Dr Stuart  View of Society  c Notes  on  sect chap ii p

published by Dr Percy in the first volume of his  Reliques  when the king is informed that knight is sick he says  Fetche me down my daughter deere  She is a leeche fulle fine  v  V This stanza is now first printed It is surprising it's omission was not marked in the frag∣ment formerly published as without it the circum∣stance of the knight's complaint is altogether foreign and vague The loss was attempted to be glossed over by many variations of the preceding four lines but the defect was palpable to the most inattentive peruser  V  Lord Chattan  This is a very ancient and honourable Scottish surname Some genealogists derive them from the  Chatti  an ancient German tribe but others with more probability from the  Gilchattan  of Ireland St  Chattan  was one of the first Scotish confessors to whom was dedicated the priory of  Ard∣chattan  in Lorn founded in and some others through the kingdom The chief of the clan  Chattan  dying in the reign of David I without male issue the clan assumed the ancestor of the  M'Phersons  for su∣perior by which means the name appears to have been lost in that of  M'Pherson  See  Buchanan's Brief Enquiry into the Genealogy and Present State of Ancient Scottish Surnames  Glasgow to  p    We however find the Clan Chattan mentioned as late as in  The History of the Feuds and Conflicts of the Clans published from a MS of the reign of James VI  Glasgow where a Macintosh is called their chief  V Though we learn from  Buchanan's Equiry  c that the clan  Chattan  are said to have come into Scotland long before the expulsion of the Picts yet I do not find this pretty anecdote which is much in the spirit of Homer has any foundation in history The empire of the Picts was demolished by Kenneth about four centuries before the apparent date of the events narrated in this poem  V  Mak orisons  c This is perfectly in the style of knighthood Before they entered into com∣bat they solemly invoked the aid of God their Saviour or their mistress religion and gallantry being the prime motives of all their adventures  Les premieres leçons qu'on leur donnoit regardoient principalement l'amour de Dieu et des dames c'est à dire la religion et la

the  Histoire des Trou∣badours  of L'Abbé Milot and the  Specimens of Welsh Poetry  published by Mr Evans So blind is the untu∣tored mind to the proper discrimination of it's ideas  V  Playand Pibrochs  Of the  pibroch  I can∣not give a better account than in the words of an ex∣cellent author  A pibroch is a species of tune pe∣culiar I think to the Highlands and Western Isles of Scotland It is performed on a bagpipe and differs totally from all other music Its rythm is so irregu∣lar  and its notes especially in the quick movement so mixed and huddled together that a stranger finds it almost impossible to reconcile his ear to it so as to perceive its modulation Some of these  pibrochs  being intended to represent a battle begin with a grave mo∣tion resembling a march then gradually quicken into the onset run off with noisy confusion and turbu∣lent rapidity to imitate the conflict and pursuit then swell into a few flourishes of triumphant joy and perhaps close with the wild and slow wailings of a funeral procession  Essays by Dr Beattie  vo ed p  note  V  Eir faes their dint mote drie  This is substi∣tuted in place of a line of consummate nonsense which has stained all the former editions Many such are cor∣rected in this impression from comparing different re∣hearsals and still more from conjecture When an ig∣norant person is desired to repeat a ballad and is at a loss for the original expression he naturally supplies it with whatever absurdity first occurs to him that will form a rime These the Editor made not the smallest scruple to correct as he always imagined that common sense might have its use even in emendatory criticism  V  But on his forehead  c The circumstances in this description seem borrowed from those of different battles betwixt the Kings of Scotland and Norway I find in no historian that Alexander was wounded in the battle of Largs on the contrary it is even doubted  whether he was present but in that near  Nairn  Mal∣colm II was wounded

women to mourn for the warriors who fell in battle may be traced to the most distant antiquity Lucilius one of the earliest Roman poets in a couplet preserved by Nonius mentions this prac∣tice

to any in Homer for those little anecdotes and strokes of nature which are so deservedly admired in that mas∣ter 'Poetry and Rhetoric' says the author of an En∣quiry into the origin of our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful  do not succeed in exact description so well as Painting does their business is to affect rather by sympathy than imitation to display rather the effect of things on the mind

great abundance to the great admiration of all the beholders  See likewise  Memoirs of the Affairs of Scotland by David Moyses  Edin where this piece is reprinted  ver∣batim  Maister William Rynd a servant of Lord Gowrie's deposition in the same volume  p  has singular anecdotes with regard to these  characters  V Fairy  charm  The word  fairy  seemes to have been accepted by the ancient English and Scotish poets for  supernatural  or  enchanted  So Chaucer speaking of  Cambuscan's  horse  It was of fairie as the peple semed  Squires Tale  p  V It was the priviledge of the knights to hide their faces with armour so that it was impossible to distinguish any one from another except by his  blazon  which seems at first to have been displayed over them but came at length to be painted on their shields whence  Coats of Arms  A  villein  was obliged to have his countenance uncovered in battle This circumstance attended to will save our wonder at Hardyknute's not  knowing Draffan in the First Part and Draffan's not perceiving Malcolm here till his spear tore off his visor though Rothiay knows Draffan either from his wearing a  blazon  on his armour or from his face being uncovered in order to breathe from the combat  V  Cheir ye my  mirrie men c It should have been remarked on the first appearance of this word P I v that  mirrie  was anciently used in a very different sense from its present It signified  honest true faithful  but no where  jovial  King James VI in his  Daemonologie  MS  pen Edit  Surelie the difference vul∣gaire put betwixt thame is verrie  mirrie and in a man∣ner trew  p  And again in p  Many  honest and mirrie  men  In like manner Merlin's Prophecies are styled '  Mirrie words  ' in that of Beid  Proph of Rymer  c  V  Oh King of Hevin  This is a common ap∣pellation of the Deity with the more ancient Scottish Poets  By Hevins King  is the familiar oath of  Blind Harrie's  heroes  V  By my Forbere's saul  Swearing by the souls of their ancestors was another used mode in those times The greatest thought this oath most strong and honour∣able probably because it implied the souls of their forefathers were in heaven and as was then believed might lend them a supernatural aid if the intention of their oath was just and unblameable  V '  Now mind your aith  ' c This passage is obscure the meaning I apprehend is that Draffan  had before the combat exacted an oath of Allan his baneret that he would slay him should the necessity of his affairs demand this sacrifice More willing to lose his own life than possibly to take that of his great anta∣gonist he commands Allan to fulfil his engagement which with all the heroic faith of those times he does without a pause The particular expression  The  shynand blade  might lead us to imagine that it was thought impossible to pierce the supposed enchanted armour but with one particular weapon likeways perhaps  charmed  V  Icolm  The Nunnery at Icolm or Icolm∣kill was one of the most noted in Scotland The Nuns were of the order of  Augustine  and wore a white gown and above it a rocket of fine linen  Spotiswood's Account of the Religious Houses in Scotland  p The ruins of this nunnery are still to be seen with many tombs of the Princesses one of which bears the year  Martin's Western Islands  p  I cannot conclude my remarks on this Poem without wasting one on the story of Mrs Wardlaw That this lady may have indeed received a MS of it as mentioned in Dr Percy's introductory note is highly probable Many valuable MSS prepared for the press have had a worse fate But that she was the author of this capital composition so fraught with science of ancient manners as the above notes testify I will no more credit than that the common people in Lanarkshire  who can repeat scraps of both the parts are the authors of the passages they rehearse That she did not refuse the name of being the original composer is a strange argument would not the first poet in Europe think it added to his reputation If conjecture may be allowed where proof must ever be wanting I suspect if we assign the end of the fifteenth century as the date of the antique parts of this noble production we shall not greatly err though at the same time the language must convince us that many strokes have been bestowed by modern hands  Since the first publication of this volume Sir David Dalrymple Lord Hales whose abilities have been so often and so successfully exerted in illustrating the antiquities of his country to the law and the literature of which he is so great an ornament has communi∣cated to the Editor some notices with regard to this poem of Hardyknute which shall here be laid before the reader almost in his own words  The following are extracts of a letter written by Sir John Bruce of Kinross to Lord Binning about the year  To perform my promise I send you a true copy of the manuscript I found some weeks ago in a vault at Dumferline It is written on vellum in a fair Gothic character but so much defaced by time as you'll find that the tenth part is not legible  Sir John transcribes some stanzas which he calls  verses  After l P I he says  here are four verses defaced  and then he transcribes l  At l he adds  hiatus in MS  and then he tran∣scribes l At l he says  Here are ten verses stanzas so spoilt that I can only guess by the many proper names that they contain the order of battle of the Scots army as they stood ranged under their different chieftains  In conclusion Sir John says  there's a vast deal more of it but all defaced  The reader is left to judge whether this story of the manuscript on vellum c has most the appearance of a true narrative or of a  jeu d' esprit  addressed to a fami∣liar friend  Lord Hales has a copy of the original edition of Har∣dyknute with MS alterations in the hand writing of Dr John Clerk Physician in Edinburgh At l it has '  brade  Thomas' Sir John Bruce has  bred  Mal∣colm  At l Sir John Bruce's MS has 'Walter' instead of 'Malcolm' At l 'brazen' for 'silver' and at l 'iron doors' for  painted bowers  In Dr Clerk's MS lines run thus  To join his king adown the hill  In hast his strides he bent  While minstrels playand pibrochs fine  Afore him stately went  In Dr Clerk's MS the stanza  On Norway's coast  c comes in after the stanza  There on a lee  with much pro∣priety that reading is therefore followed in this edi∣tion  At l for 'owr' the MS has 'oy'  The last line in the MS was originally  He feared a coud be feared  but has been changed into that which occurs in later editions  CHILD MAURICE  THIS is undoubtedly the true title of this incom∣parable Ballad though corrupted into Gil Mor∣rice by the nurses and old women from whose mouths it was originally published  Child  seems to have been of equal importance with  Damoiseau  See note on P I v of Hardyknute and applicable to a young noble∣man when about the age of fifteen It occurs in Shak∣speare's Lear in the following line probably borrowed from some old romance or ballad  Child Roland to the dark tower came  Act III S  And in Chaucer's  Rime of Sir Topas Child  is evidently used to denote a young and noble knight Many in∣stances might likewise be brought from Spenser for this signification  Gil Morrice is only the northern pronunciation of the true name of this ballad  Gil  about Aberdeen c still signifies  Child  as it does in Galic witness the name  Gilchrist  the child of Christ c  V  He bent his bow  Archery was enjoined the Scotish warrior at a very early age as appears from many special laws to that effect and particularly the following one of James I  Item That all men busk them to be Archeres fra they be  twelfe yeir of age  and that in ilk ten pundis worthe of lande their be maid bowmarkis and speciallie neir to Paroche kirkis quhairin upon haly daies men may cum and at the leist schutte thrise about and have usage of archerie and quha sa usis not the said archerie the Laird of the lande sall raise of him a wedder and giff the Laird raises not the said payne the King's schireffe or his ministers shall raise it to the King  Parl  I §  V  ezar  This word is perhaps the same with  mazer  as used by the English poets  A mighty mazer bowl of wine was set  Spenser F Q II  A mazer ywrought of the maple ware  Spenser's Calendar August  So golden mazer wont suspicion breed  Of deadly hemlocks poison'd potion  says Hall in the prologue to his admirable Satires  Ezar cup  will then mean a large bowl of any material  V  O what means a the folk coming My mother tarries lang  This stroke of nature is delicate It paints the very thought of youth and innocence In such happy  tenuity  of phrase this exquisite composi∣tion is only rivalled by the  Merope  of  Maffei  the most finished Tragedy in the world Some lines fancifully interpolated by a modern and very inferior hand are here omitted  V  And slaided owr the strae  The meaning is  He went bastily over the rank grass  V  As the hip is o the stean  This would appear the corruption of some nurse but taking it as it stands the simile though none of the most delicate has a parallel in the Father of English Poetry  But he was chaste and no lechoure  And sweet as is the bramble floure  That bearethe the red hip  Chaucer Sir Topas  ADAM O GORDON  THE genuine subject of this Ballad has long re∣mained in obscurity though it must have been noted to every peruser of  Crawford's Memoirs  'But to return to Gordon'  viz  Sir Adam Gordon of Auchindown brother to the Earl of Huntly  as these two actions against Forbes or to speak more properly against the rebels gained him a vast repu∣tationhis next exploit was attended with an equal portion of infamy and he was as much decryed for this unlucky action though at the same time he had no immediate hand in the matter as for his former ones he had been applauded He had sent one  Captain Ker  with a party of foot to summon the Castle of  Towie  in the Queen's name The owner Alexander Forbes was not then at home and his lady confiding too much in her sex not only refused to surrender but gave Ker very injurious language upon which unreasonably transported with fury he ordered his men to fire the castle and barbarously burnt the unfortunate gentlewoman with her whole family amounting to thirtyseven persons Nor was he ever so much as cashiered for this inhuman action which made Gordon share both in the scandal and the guilt  An    p    edit    In this narrative is immediately perceived every lead∣ing circumstance in the Ballad The  Captain Car  by which name it was distinguished in Dr Percy's Manu∣script is evidently the  Ker  of Crawford The House of  Rodes  I have corrected according to the truth of story  Towie  Of which name I find in  Gordon of Straloch's  map of Aberdeenshire there were two gentlemen's seats or castles in his time one upon the  Don  and another upon the  Ythan  The nearest seat to the latter is that of  Rothy  which from wrong information may have originally stood in the Ballad the mistake rising naturally from the vicinity of their situation and from this have been corrupted to  Rodes  The courage of this lady as represented in the Ballad was equalled by that of the famous Countess of Salisbury at the siege of Roxborough and of Ladies Arundel and Banks in the last civil wars of England See particularly the  Mercu∣rius Rusticus  c Lond Sections V and XI  V  Freits  This word signifies  ill omens  and sometimes as here  Accidents supernaturally unlucky  King James VI in his  Daemonologie MS pen Edit  B I

are some of these marks  Though it is published by Dr Percy and of conse∣quence in every body's hands yet it was necessary to give it here else this digest of such Scotish tragic bal∣lads as deserve preservation could not have been called complete  VI  John Faw was king of the gypsies in Scotland in the reign of James IV who about the year issued a proclamation ordaining all sheriffs c to assist John Faw in seizing and securing fugitive gypsies and that they should lend him their prisons stocks fetters c for that purpose charging the lieges that none of them molest vex unquiet or trouble the said Faw  and his company in doing their  lawful business  within the realm and in their passing remaining or going forth of the same under penalty and charging skip∣pers masters of ships and mariners within the realm at all ports and havens to receive said John and his company upon their expences for furthering them furth of the realm to parts beyond sea See  Mr Mac∣laurin's Remarkable Cases  c  p    V  Glamour  The  glamour  was believed to be a kind of magical mist raised by sorcerers which deluded their spectators with visions of things which had no real existence altered the appearance of these which really did exist c The Eastern nations have a similar superstition as we may learn from Mr Galland's  Mille et un nuit  and other translations of works of Oriental fiction  SIR HUGH OR THE JEW's DAUGHTER is composed of two copies one published by Dr Percy the other in a collection of Scotish Songs c  Edin  The  Mirryland toun  of the former and  Mirry Linkin  of the latter evidently shew that the noted story of Hugh of Lincoln is here expressed  FLODDEN FIELD  THE stanzas here given form a complete copy of this exquisite Dirge The inimitable beauty of the original induced a variety of versifiers to mingle stanzas of their own composure But it is the painful though most necessary duty of an Editor by the touch∣stone of truth to discriminate such dross from the gold of antiquity  SIR PATRICK SPENCE is given from Dr Percy's Edition which indeed agrees with the stall copies and the common recitals I have however lent it a few corrections where palpable ab∣surdity seemed to require them The phrase in v of seeing the old moon  in the arms  of the new is still fa∣miliar in Scotland It means that the opaque part of the moon's disk casts a glimmering light while the illumi∣nated part is waxing and is to this hour esteemed to prognosticate a storm  LADY BOTHWELL's LAMENT  THESE four stanzas appeared to the Editor to be all that are genuine in this elegy Many additional ones are to be found in the common copies which are rejected as of meaner execution In a quarto manu∣script in the Editor's possession containing a collection of Poems by different hands from the reign of Queen Elizabeth to the middle of the last century when it was apparently written  pp  there are two  Balowes  as they are there styled the first  The Balow Allan  the se∣cond  Palmer's Balow  this last is that commonly called Lady Bothwell's Lament and the three first stanzas in this edition are taken from it as is the last from  Allan's Balow  They are injudiciously mingled in Ram∣say's Edition and several stanzas of his own added a liberty he used much too often in printing ancient Scotish poems  EARL OF MURRAY  V last  Toun  This word is often used in Scotland to denote only perhaps a farmhouse and officehouses or a number of hovels scattered here and there and on which the English would not bestow the name of a village  A very eminent Scotish antiquary informs me that in Saxon  ton  signifies an habitation and that  castle downe  in the last stanza of this ballad ought to be read  Castle Downe  the seat of Lord Murray in his own right  SIR JAMES THE ROSE is given from a modern edition in one sheet mo after the old copy A renovation of this Ballad composed of new and improbable circumstances decked out with scraps of tragedies may be found in the Annual Re∣gister for and other collections  Rose  is an an∣cient and honourable name in Scotland  Johannes de Rose  is a witness to the famous Charter of  Robert  II testifying his marriage with  Elizabeth More  as appears in the rare edition of it printed at Paris to  p    V  Belted Knichts  The  belt  was one of the chief marks which distinguished the ancient knight  To be girt with the belt of knighthood  often implied the whole attending ceremonies which constituted that order That of the common knight was of white leather  LAIRD OF WOODHOUSELIE  THIS Ballad is now first published Whether it has any real foundation the Editor cannot be positive though it is very likely There is a  Woodhouselie  nigh Edinburgh which may possibly be that here meant  LORD LIVINGSTON  probably an ancestor of Livingston Earl of Linlith∣  attainted in This affecting piece likewise with the four following now appears for the first time  V  Saith dreims are scant  This seems a prover∣biai

to the Fairies another creation of superstition is given by way of specimen of this singular MS Book III Ch  ARGUMENT  The description of the fourth kynde of Spreitis called the  Pharie  What is possible chairin and what is but illusions Whow far this dialogue entreates of all thir thingis and to what ende  P  Now I pray you come on to that fourt kynd of spreittis  E  That fourt kynde of Spreitis quhilk be the gentiles was called Diana and her wandring court and amongs us was called the  Pharie  as I tolde you or our guid neighbouris  the King has added on the margin 'or sillie wightis'  was ane of the sortis of allusions that was ryfest in tyme of Papistrie for all∣though it was holdin odious to prophesie be the devill yet whome these kynd of spreittis caried away and informed thay wer thought to be sonciest and of best lyfe To speak of the manie vaine tratlis foundit upon that illusion how thair was ane king and queine of  Pharie  of sic a jolie court and traine as thay had how thay had a teind and a dewtie as it wer of all guidis how thay naturallie raid and yeld eat and drank and did all other actions lyke naturall men and wemen I think it is lyker Virgilis  Campi Elisei  nor any thing that aught to be beleived be Chris∣tianis  This Manuscript is written in a beautiful Italic hand so nearly resembling copperplate engraving as to have been taken for such even after accurate examination It is bound in gilded vellum stamped with the King's eypher beneath the crown and is in all probability the  original copy of this royal monument of superstition Many additions are inserted on the margin as would seem of the handwriting of James VI and some notes for his own private use As for instance on  B  II  ch  speaking of the Magicians of his time over against the words  Thay are sume of thame riche and worldlie wyse  he has noted  F M  sum of tham fat or cor∣pulent in their bodies  R G  and maist pairt of thame altogethir gevin ouer to the pleasours of the flesche  B N  We need not wonder at the severity with which the imaginary crime of withcraft was punished in his reign when we remark his sentiment expressed on this head in  B  III  ch  of this singular tract  P  Then to make ane ende of our conference sence I see it drawis leatt what forme of punishment think ye merites thir Magiciens and Witches For I see that ye account thame to be all alyke giltie E  The King Thay aught to be put to deathe  according to the law of God the civill and imperiall law and the municipal law of all Christiane nations  P  But what kynde of death I pray you  E  It is commonly used be fyre but that is ane indifferent thing to be used in every countrey according to the law or custume thairof  P But aught no sexe aage nor rank to be eximed  E NONE AT ALL  The language of this pedantic Monarch is particular it is that of a Scotish schoolboy beginning to read English  In the printed copies the style is much altered and improved It was printed at Edinburgh and re∣printed at London in the same year to  LORD AIRTH's COMPLAINT  THESE verses though somewhat uncouth are moving as they seem to flow from the heart They are now first published from the Editor's quarto Manu∣script  p  corrected in some lines which appeared too inaccurate for the publick eye Two entire stanzas are rejected from the same cause I know nothing of the nobleman to whom they are ascribed  In the same Manuscript  p  and are to be found the two following Poems which I believe have never been in print They are here added with a few corrections They were both written by Sir Robert Aytoun who bore some office under government in the reign of James VI if I mistake not His Latin poems are in the Delitiae Poetarum Scotorum  SONNET  WILT thou remorseless fair still laugh while I lament  Shall still thy chief contentment be to see me malcontent  Shall I Narcissus like a flying shadow chase  Or like Pygmalion love a stone crown'd with a winning face  No know my blind Love now shall follow Reason's eyes  And as thy fairness made me fond thy temper make me wise  My loyalty disdains to love a loveless dame  The spirit still of Cupid's fire consists in mutual flame  Hadst thou but given one look or hadst thou given one smile  Or hadst thou lent but one poor sigh my sorrows to beguile  My captive Thoughts perchance had been redeem'd from Pain  And these my mutinous Discontents made friends with Hope again  But thou I know at length art careless of my good  And wouldst ambitiously embrew thy beauty in my blood  A great disgrace to thee to me a monstrous wrong  Which time may teach thee to repent ere haply it be long  But to prevent thy shame and to abridge my woe  Because thou canst not love thy friend I'll cease to love my foe  SONG  WHAT means this strangeness now of late  Since Time must Truth approve  This distance may consist with state  It cannot stand with love  'Tis either cunning or distrust  That may such ways allow  The first is base the last unjust  Let neither blemish you  For if you mean to draw me on  There needs not half this art  And if you mean to have me gone  You overact your part  If kindness cross your wish'd content  Dismiss me with a frown  I'll give you all the love that's spent  The rest shall be my own  FRAGMENTS  The two first of these are given from a Collection Edinburgh but polished by the present
